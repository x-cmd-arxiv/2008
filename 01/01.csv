$|S|$ if in the equation $x_0=Q(x_1,...,x_n)$ knowledge of any $n$ elements of
$x_0,...,x_n$ uniquely specifies the remaining one. An $n$-ary quasigroup $Q$

obtained from $Q$ or one of its inverses by fixing $n-m>0$ arguments.
  We show that every irreducible $n$-ary quasigroup has an irreducible
$(n-1)$-ary or $(n-2)$-ary retract; moreover, if the order is finite and prime,
then it has an irreducible $(n-1)$-ary retract. We apply this result to show
that all $n$-ary quasigroups of order 5 or 7 whose all binary retracts are
isotopic to $Z_5$ or $Z_7$ are reducible for $n>3$.

introduce a parameterization for N(E) based upon an anisotropic energy-gap
/Delta (\vec k)=/Delta_{1}(Cos(k_{x})-Cos(k_{y}))/2 plus an effective
scattering rate which varies linearly with energy /Gamma_{2}(E) . We
demonstrate that this form of N(E) allows successful fitting of differential
tunnelling conductance spectra throughout much of the
Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+/delta} phase diagram. The resulting average
/Delta_{1} values rise with falling p along the familiar trajectory of
excitations to the 'pseudogap' energy, while the key scattering rate
/Gamma_{2}^{*}=/Gamma_{2}(E=/Delta_{1}) increases from below ~1meV to a value
approaching 25meV as the system is underdoped from p~16% to p<10%. Thus, a
single, particle-hole symmetric, anisotropic energy-gap, in combination with a
strongly energy and doping dependent effective scattering rate, can describe
the spectra without recourse to another ordered state. Nevertheless we also
observe two distinct and diverging energy scales in the system: the energy-gap
maximum /Delta_{1} and a lower energy scale /Delta_{0} separating the spatially
homogeneous and heterogeneous electronic structures.

that physics at the Planck scale may modify the spectrum of Hawking radiation

been shown that, the T-duality symmetry of string fluctuations along compact
extra dimensions leads to a modification of the standard propagator of point
particles in quantum field theory. At low energies (when compared to the string
scale), the modified propagator is found to behave as though the spacetime

\alpha < 5, we show that there are two static solutions to the Einstein
equations for given values of the brane stress-energies. Close to the static
solutions, the relation between Hubble expansion rate H and brane tension
reproduces the standard 4D result for small H, but exhibits unusual deviations
when H is of order the AdS curvature scale. The two static branches for 1
<\alpha < 5 are shown to come together smoothly at a maximum value of H;
however the radion is shown to be unstable in the branch with higher H. This
remains true even with a mechanism for stabilization of the radion, i.e., the
Goldberger-Wise (GW) mechanism, since large enough H overcomes the force of
stabilization. Even in the unstabilized case, cosmological constraints on the
time and spatial variation of Newton's constant are typically satisfied; only
fifth force constraints require the stabilization. For \alpha > 5 the model is
intrinsically stable, without the need for a GW field, and in this case we show
that inflationary predictions can be modified by the nonstandard Friedmann
equation; in particular it is possible to get an upper limit on the spectral
index, large deviations from the consistency condition between the tensor
spectrum and ratio r, and large running of the spectral index even though the
slow roll parameters remain small.

it first using quantities that have a direct correspondent in the case of a
causal set, namely volumes, causal relations, and timelike lengths, as
variables to describe the geometry. In this step, the local Lagrangian density
$L(f;x)$ for a set of fields $f$ is recast into a quasilocal expression
$L_0(f;p,q)$ that depends on pairs of causally related points $p \prec q$ and
is a function of the values of $f$ in the Alexandrov set defined by those
points, and whose limit as $p$ and $q$ approach a common point $x$ is $L(f;x)$.
We then describe how to discretize $L_0(f;p,q)$, and use it to define a
discrete action.

display a rise and fall in the space density distribution of active black holes

with a constant slope of beta of about -3.3 at all epochs. This slope is
similar to the bright end slope of the luminosity function for epochs below z =

larger age. For PSR B1951+32, we measure a proper motion of (mu_a, mu_d) =

proper motion by a factor of two compared to previous results. After correcting
to the local standard of rest, the proper motion indicates a kinetic age of ~51
kyr for the pulsar, assuming it was born near the geometric center of the
supernova remnant. The radio-bright arc of emission along the pulsar proper
motion vector shows time-variable structure, but moves with the pulsar at an
approximately constant separation ~2.5"", lending weight to its interpretation
as a shock structure driven by the pulsar.

constituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of
such a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the
agents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,
they are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations
can be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally
validate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical
framework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally
establish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known
mathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one
such framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic
and stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a
sampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite
dynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties
of multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a
universal model for computation.

observations. Different regimes of turbulence correspond to different density
spectra. For instance, the viscosity-damped regime of MHD turbulence relevant,
for instance, to partially ionized gas, can be characterized by shallow and
very anisotropic spectrum of density. This spectrum can result in substantial
variations of the column densities. Addressing MHD turbulence in the regime
when viscosity is not important over the inertial range, we demonstrate with
numerical simulations that it is possible to reproduce both the observed
Kolmogorov spectrum of density fluctuations observed in ionized gas by
measuring scintillations and more shallow spectra that are obtained through the
emission measurements. We show that in supersonic turbulence the high density
peaks dominate shallow isotropic spectrum, while the small-scale underlying
turbulence that fills most of the volume has the Kolmogorov spectrum and
demonstrates scale-dependent anisotropy. The limitations of the spectrum in
studying turbulence induce searches of alternative statistics. We demonstrate
that a measure called ""bispectrum"" may be a promising tool. Unlike spectrum,
the bispectrum preserves the information about wave phases.

systematic torques arising from infrared emission and torques arising from the

namely, torques due to H$_2$ formation, the variation of accommodation
coefficient for gaseous collisions and photoelectric emission. Furthermore, we
revise the Lazarian & Draine model for grain thermal flipping. We calculate
mean flipping timescale induced by Barnett and nuclear relaxation for both
paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains, in the presence of stochastic
torques associated with pinwheel torques, e.g. the stochastic torques arising
from H$_2$ formation, and gas bombardment. We show that the combined effect of
internal relaxation and stochastic torques can result in fast flipping for
sufficiently small grains and, because of this, they get thermally trapped,
i.e. rotate thermally in spite of the presence of pinwheel torques. For
sufficiently large grains, we show that the pinwheel torques can increase the
degree of grain alignment achievable with the radiative torques by increasing
the magnitude of the angular momentum of low attractor points and/or by driving

Plastic flow was treated through explicit slip systems, with flow on each

resolved stress. Compared with simple Arrhenius rates, the biased random jumps
caused significant differences in plastic strain rate as a function of
temperature and pressure, and provided a seamless transition to the ultimate
theoretical strength of the material. The behavior of the theory was
investigated for matter with approximate properties for Ta, demonstrating the
importance of the high pressure, high strain rate contributions.

almost all high redshift sources with a flux density above 100mJy will be
lensed, if they are not relatively local galaxies. We also give estimates of
the fraction of sources experiencing strong lensing as a function of observed
flux density. This has implications for planning follow-up observations for
bright SMGs discovered in future surveys with SCUBA-2 and other instruments.
The largest uncertainty in these calculations is the maximum allowed lensing

two stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable

With the cubes, assuming perfect grain alignment, we created synthetic
polarimetric maps for different orientations of the mean magnetic field with
respect to the line of sight (LOS). We show that the dispersion of the
polarization angle depends on the angle of the mean magnetic field regarding
the LOS and on the Alfvenic Mach number. However, the second order structure
function of the polarization angle follows the relation $SF \propto
l^{\alpha}$, $\alpha$ being dependent exclusively on the Alfvenic Mach number.
The results show an anti-correlation between the polarization degree and the
column density, with exponent $\gamma \sim -0.5$, in agreement with
observations, which is explained by the increase in the dispersion of the
polarization angle along the LOS within denser regions. However, this effect
was observed exclusively on supersonic, but sub-Alfvenic, simulations. For the
super-Alfvenic, and the subsonic model, the polarization degree showed to be
intependent on the column density. Our major quantitative result is a
generalized equation for the CF method, which allowed us to determine the
magnetic field strength from the polarization maps with errors $< 20%$. We also

  Let $(M,g)$ be a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold of dimension
$\ge 3$. Suppose that the sectional curvature $K$ satisfies
  $ -1-s(r) \le K \le -1$, where $r$ denotes distance to a fixed point in
  $M$. If $\lim_{r \rt \infty} e^{2r}s(r) =0$, then $(M,g)$ has to be isometric
to ${\mathbb H}^n$.
  The same proof also yields that if $K$ satisfies $-s(r) \le K \le 0$ where
$\lim_{r \rt \infty} r^2s(r)=0$, then $(M,g)$ is isometric to $\R^n$, a result
due to Greene and Wu. Our second result is a local one: Let $(M,g)$ be any
Riemannian manifold. For $a \in \R$, if $K \le a$ on a geodesic ball $B_p(R)$
in $M$ and $K = a$ on $\partial B_p(R)$, then $K= a $ on $B_p(R)$.

imposes new upper limits on the X-ray flux due to inverse Compton scattering of
photons from the cosmic microwave background by relativistic electrons in the
relic sources, and new lower limits on the magnetic field strength from the
relative strength of the radio and X-ray emission. The combination of radio and
X-ray observations provides a measure of the magnetic field independent of
equipartition or minimum energy assumptions. Due to increasing sensitivity of
radio observations, the known population of cluster relics has been growing;
however, studies of non-thermal X-ray emission from relics remain scarce. Our
study adds to the small sample of relics studied in X-rays. In both relics, our
field strength lower limits are slightly larger than estimates of the
equipartition magnetic field.

a previously used formula for evaluating Schottky-type noise of a ""classical""

the distance between the oscillators. We show that for the range parameter
$\alpha <2$, the long-range interaction dominates and the one-dimensional
system retains a crystalline order even at a finite temperature whereas for
$\alpha \geq2$, the long-range crystalline order vanishes even at an
infinitesimally small temperature. We also study the effect of quantum
