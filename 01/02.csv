Poincare dodecahedral space (PDS) rather than an infinite, simply connected,
flat space. Both models assume a close to flat FLRW metric of about 30% matter
density. We study two predictions of the PDS model. (i) For the correct model,
the spatial two-point cross-correlation function, $\ximc$, of temperature
fluctuations in the covering space, where the two points in any pair are on
different copies of the surface of last scattering (SLS), should be of a
similar order of magnitude to the auto-correlation function, $\xisc$, on a
single copy of the SLS. (ii) The optimal orientation and identified circle
radius for a ""generalised"" PDS model of arbitrary twist $\phi$, found by
maximising $\ximc$ relative to $\xisc$ in the WMAP maps, should yield $\phi \in
\{\pm 36\deg\}$. We optimise the cross-correlation at scales < 4.0 h^-1 Gpc
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method over orientation, circle size
and $\phi$. Both predictions were satisfied: (i) an optimal ""generalised"" PDS
solution was found, with a strong cross-correlation between points which would
be distant and only weakly correlated according to the simply connected
hypothesis, for two different foreground-reduced versions of the WMAP 3-year
all-sky map, both with and without the kp2 Galaxy mask: the face centres are
$(l,b)_{i=1,6}\approx (184d, 62d), (305d, 44d), (46d, 49d), (117d, 20d), (176d,
-4d), (240d, 13d) to within ~2d, and their antipodes; (ii) this solution has
twist \phi= (+39 \pm 2.5)d, in agreement with the PDS model. The chance of this
occurring in the simply connected model, assuming a uniform distribution $\phi
\in [0,2\pi]$, is about 6-9%.

Nature. The gravitational collapse of such a boson cloud would lead to a boson
star (BS) as a new type of a compact object. Similarly as for white dwarfs and
neutron stars, there exists a limiting mass, below which a BS is stable against
complete gravitational collapse to a black hole. According to the form of the
self-interaction of the basic constituents and the spacetime symmetry, we can
distinguish mini-, axidilaton, soliton, charged, oscillating and rotating BSs.
Their compactness prevents a Newtonian approximation, however, modifications of
general relativity, as in the case of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory as a low energy
limit of strings, would provide them with gravitational memory. In general, a
BS is a compact, completely regular configuration with structured layers due to
the anisotropy of scalar matter, an exponentially decreasing 'halo', a critical
mass inversely proportional to constituent mass, an effective radius, and a
large particle number. Due to the Heisenberg principle, there exists a
completely stable branch, and as a coherent state, it allows for rotating
solutions with quantised angular momentum. In this review, we concentrate on
the fascinating possibilities of detecting the various subtypes of (excited)
BSs: Possible signals include gravitational redshift and (micro-)lensing,
emission of gravitational waves, or, in the case of a giant BS, its dark matter
contribution to the rotation curves of galactic halos.

selectivity with natural stimuli in the framework of the linear-nonlinear

number of relevant stimulus components. The relevant stimulus dimensions can be
found by maximizing one of the family of objective functions, Renyi divergences
of different orders. We show that maximizing one of them, Renyi divergence of
order 2, is equivalent to least-square fitting of the linear-nonlinear model to
neural data. Next, we derive reconstruction errors in relevant dimensions found
by maximizing Renyi divergences of arbitrary order in the asymptotic limit of
large spike numbers. We find that the smallest rrors are obtained with Renyi
divergence of order 1, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence. This
corresponds to finding relevant dimensions by maximizing mutual information. We
numerically test how these optimization schemes perform in the regime of low
signal-to-noise ratio (small number of spikes and increasing neural noise) for
model visual neurons. We find that optimization schemes based on either least
square fitting or information maximization perform well even when number of
spikes is small. Information maximization provides slightly, but significantly,
better reconstructions than least square fitting. This makes the problem of
finding relevant dimensions, together with the problem of lossy compression,
one of examples where information-theoretic measures are no more data limited

prove that postulating such a decomposition is equivalent to having a uniform

evolutions of the material and discuss the form of the internal energy and that
of the dissipative potential. The evolution equations are obtained for the
configurations $(\phi,\phi_{1})$ and the material metric $\mathbf g$.
  Finally the dissipative inequality for the materials of this type is
presented.It is shown that the conditions of positivity of the internal
dissipation terms related to the processes of plastic and metric evolution
provide the anisotropic yield criteria.

of dark energy is investigated by assuming that the dark energy is a
relativistic perfect simple fluid obeying the equation of state (EoS),
$p=\omega \rho$ ($\omega <0, constant$). The entropy condition, $S \geq 0$,
implies that the possible values of $\omega$ are heavily dependent on the
magnitude, as well as on the sign of the chemical potential. For $\mu >0$, the
$\omega$-parameter must be greater than -1 (vacuum is forbidden) while for $\mu
< 0$ not only the vacuum but even a phantomlike behavior ($\omega <-1$) is
allowed. In any case, the ratio between the chemical potential and temperature
remains constant, that is, $\mu/T=\mu_0/T_0$. Assuming that the dark energy
constituents have either a bosonic or fermionic nature, the general form of the
spectrum is also proposed. For bosons $\mu$ is always negative and the extended
Wien's law allows only a dark component with $\omega < -1/2$ which includes
vacuum and the phantomlike cases. The same happens in the fermionic branch for
$\mu <0$. However, fermionic particles with $\mu >0$ are permmited only if $-1
< \omega < -1/2$. The thermodynamics and statistical arguments constrain the
EoS parameter to be $\omega < -1/2$, a result surprisingly close to the maximal
value required to accelerate a FRW type universe dominated by matter and dark
energy ($\omega \lesssim -10/21$).

world could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional

matter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the
many conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If
the universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no
longer be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is
suggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality
is a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how
core physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could

graphical model on a loopy graph the functional may show multiple minima, the
iterative BP algorithm may converge to one of the minima or may not converge at
all, and the global minimum of the Bethe free energy functional is not
guaranteed to correspond to the optimal Maximum-Likelihood (ML) solution in the
zero-temperature limit. However, there are exceptions to this general rule,
discussed in \cite{05KW} and \cite{08BSS} in two different contexts, where
zero-temperature version of the BP algorithm finds ML solution for special
models on graphs with loops. These two models share a key feature: their ML
solutions can be found by an efficient Linear Programming (LP) algorithm with a
Totally-Uni-Modular (TUM) matrix of constraints. Generalizing the two models we
consider a class of graphical models reducible in the zero temperature limit to
LP with TUM constraints. Assuming that a gedanken algorithm, g-BP, funding the
global minimum of the Bethe free energy is available we show that in the limit
of zero temperature g-BP outputs the ML solution. Our consideration is based on
equivalence established between gapless Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of

  submission and improves the bounds significantly",,,"UCB/EECS-2008-1","cs.IT math.IT",,"  The classical problem of reliable point-to-point digital communication is to
achieve a low probability of error while keeping the rate high and the total
power consumption small. Traditional information-theoretic analysis uses
`waterfall' curves to convey the revolutionary idea that unboundedly low
probabilities of bit-error are attainable using only finite transmit power.
However, practitioners have long observed that the decoder complexity, and
hence the total power consumption, goes up when attempting to use sophisticated
codes that operate close to the waterfall curve.
  This paper gives an explicit model for power consumption at an idealized
decoder that allows for extreme parallelism in implementation. The decoder
architecture is in the spirit of message passing and iterative decoding for
sparse-graph codes. Generalized sphere-packing arguments are used to derive
lower bounds on the decoding power needed for any possible code given only the
gap from the Shannon limit and the desired probability of error. As the gap
goes to zero, the energy per bit spent in decoding is shown to go to infinity.
This suggests that to optimize total power, the transmitter should operate at a
power that is strictly above the minimum demanded by the Shannon capacity.
  The lower bound is plotted to show an unavoidable tradeoff between the
average bit-error probability and the total power used in transmission and
decoding. In the spirit of conventional waterfall curves, we call these
`waterslide' curves.

= 50K in any of the Mn containing alloys. Mn has exclusive La (Ag) site
preference in the alloy (alloys) with x = c = 0.025 (x < = 0.05 or c < = 0.1)

in that all the Mn atoms either occupy the La sites or the Ag sites. In the

prevalent in the parent LaAg compound).

parallel relationship between the eigenvectors of the C- and E-matrices and a
linear relationship between their eigenvalues, and (b) a parallel relationship
between a contact number vector and the principal eigenvectors of the C- and

relationships are confirmed in 182 representatives from each family of the SCOP

and a contact number vector. In addition, the spectral representation of C- and
E-matrices reveals that pairwise residue-residue interactions, which depends
only on the types of interacting amino acids but not on other residues in a

connectivities and steric hindrance are needed to make native structures the

flexible, but also more resilient to attacks, failures and changing conditions.
This article addresses the quantification of the diversity of non-linear
transient dynamics obtained in undirected and unweighted complex networks as a
consequence of self-avoiding random walks. The diversity of walks starting at a
specific node $i$ is quantified in terms of a signature composed by the
entropies of the node visit probabilities along each of the initial steps. Six
theoretical models of complex networks are considered: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi,
Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, a geographical model, as well as two
recently introduced knitted networks formed by paths. The random walk diversity
is explored at the level of network categories and of individual nodes. Because
the diversity at successive steps of the walks tends to be correlated,
principal component analysis is systematically applied in order to identify the
more relevant linear combinations of the diversity entropies and to obtain
optimal dimensionality reduction. Several interesting results are reported,
including the facts that the transient diversity tends to increase with the
average degree for all considered network models and that the Watts and
Strogatz and geographical models tend to yield diversity entropies which
increase more gradually with the number of steps, contrasting sharply with the
steep increases verified for the other four considered models. The principal
linear combination of the diversities identified by the principal component
analysis method is shown to allow an interesting characterization of individual
nodes as well as partitioning of networks into subgraphs of similar diversity.

inverse of a convolution-dominated matrix is again convolution-dominated,
provided that $G$ is amenable and rigidly symmetric. For abelian groups this

completely different techniques are required, such as generalized
  $L^1$-algebras and the symmetry of group algebras.

summarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the
early XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of
Cobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to
economic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this
paper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We
use a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by
Bregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of
mathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an
aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the
standpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.
  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong
to the \textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,
this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \textit{exactly fitting}
either CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic
contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the
information standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal
information aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links
between economic and information aggregators.

The \textit{derived sequence} $\partial X$ of $X$ is the sequence of length
$m-1$ obtained by pairwise adding consecutive terms of $X$. The collection of
iterated derived sequences of $X$, until length 1 is reached, determines a
triangle, the \textit{Steinhaus triangle $\Delta X$ generated by the sequence
$X$}. We say that $X$ is \textit{balanced} if its Steinhaus triangle $\Delta X$
contains each element of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity.
An obvious necessary condition for $m$ to be the length of a balanced sequence
in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is that $n$ divides the binomial coefficient
$\binom{m+1}{2}$. It is an open problem to determine whether this condition on
$m$ is also sufficient. This problem was posed by Hugo Steinhaus in 1963 for
$n=2$ and generalized by John C. Molluzzo in 1976 for $n\geq3$. So far, only
the case $n=2$ has been solved, by Heiko Harborth in 1972. In this paper, we
answer positively Molluzzo's problem in the case $n=3^k$ for all $k\geq1$.
Moreover, for every odd integer $n\geq3$, we construct infinitely many balanced
sequences in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. This is achieved by analysing the
Steinhaus triangles generated by arithmetic progressions. In contrast, for any
$n$ even with $n\geq4$, it is not known whether there exist infinitely many
balanced sequences in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. As for arithmetic progressions,
still for $n$ even, we show that they are never balanced, except for exactly 8
cases occurring at $n=2$ and $n=6$.

\ip(X)$ in such a way that $\ip(X)$ is ``hyperbolic'' in a suitable sense and
$i$ is as close as possible to be an isomorphism. Using the theory of model
categories, we found a definition of hyperbolic simplicial sheaf (for the
strong topology) that extends the classical one of Brody for complex spaces. We
prove the existence of hyperbolic models for any simplicial sheaf. Furthermore,
the morphism $i$ can be taken to be a cofibration and an affine weak
equivalence (in an algebraic setting, Morel and Voevodsky called it an $\aff$
weak equivalence). Imitating one possible definition of homotopy groups for a
topological space, we defined the {\it holotopy} groups for a simplicial sheaf
and showed that their vanishing in ``positive'' degrees is a necessary
condition for a sheaf to be hyperbolic. We deduce that if $X$ is a complex
space with a non zero holotopy group in positive degree, then its hyperbolic
model (that in general will only be a simplicial sheaf) cannot be weakly
equivalent to a hyperbolic complex space (in particular is not itself
hyperbolic). We finish the manuscript by applying these results and a {\it
topological realization functor}, constructed in the previous section, to prove
that the hyperbolic models of the complex projective spaces cannot be weakly
equivalent to hyperbolic complex spaces.

behavior of low-dimensional systems including monatomic chains, hollow tubes,
surface skins, nanocavities, nanowires, and nanograins has long been a high
challenge. This article reports recent progress in this regard. A survey is
presented and then is followed by analytical approaches in terms of local bond
average (LBA) from the perspective of bonding energetics and its functional
dependence on external stimuli of coordination environment and temperature
change. It is shown that the measurable quantities of a specimen can be
functionally correlated to the identities of the representative bonds and their
responses to the external stimuli. It is understood that the shortened and
strengthened bonds between the under-coordinated atoms and the associated local
strain and energy trapping dictate intrinsically the mechanical behavior of
systems with large portion of under-coordinated atoms. The thermal softening of
a substance arises from thermally-induced bond expansion and lattice vibration
that weakens the bonds through the internal energy increase. The competition
between the energy-density-gain and the residual atomic cohesive-energy in the
relaxed surface skin determines intrinsically the mechanical performance of a
mesoscopic specimen, whereas competition between the activation and inhibition
of atomic dislocations dominates extrinsically the yield strength of the
specimen in plastic deformation.
