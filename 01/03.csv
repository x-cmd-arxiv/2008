by AUGER group spreading anisotropy signatures in the sky. The result have been
interpreted as a manifestation of AGN sources ejecting protons at GZK edges
mostly from Super-galactic Plane. The result is surprising due to the absence
of much nearer Virgo cluster. Moreover, early GZK cut off in the spectra may be
better reconcile with light nuclei (than with protons). In addition a large
group (nearly a dozen) of events cluster suspiciously along Cen-A. Finally,
proton UHECR composition nature is in sharp disagreement with earlier AUGER
claim of a heavy nuclei dominance at 40 EeV. Therefore we interpret here the
signals as mostly UHECR light nuclei (He, Be, B, C, O), very possibly mostly
the lightest (He,Be) ones, ejected from nearest AGN Cen-A, UHECR smeared by
galactic magnetic fields, whose random vertical bending is overlapping with
super-galactic arm. The eventual AUGER misunderstanding took place because of
such a rare coincidence between the Super Galactic Plane (arm) and the smeared
(randomized) signals from Cen-A, bent orthogonally to the Galactic fields. Our
derivation verify the consistence of the random smearing angles for He, Be and
B, C, O, in reasonable agreement with the AUGER main group events around Cen-A.
Only few other rare events are spread elsewhere. The most collimated from Cen-A
are the lightest. The most spread the heavier. Consequently Cen-A is the best
candidate UHE neutrino tau observable by HEAT and AMIGA as enhanced AUGER array
at tens-hundred PeV energy. This model maybe soon tested by new events
clustering around the Cen-A and by composition imprint study.

This is applied to determine coefficients up to order s^6R^4 (where s is a
Mandelstam invariant and R^4 the linearized super-curvature), and partial
results are obtained beyond that order. This involves integrating powers of the
scalar propagator on a toroidal world-sheet, as well as integrating over the
modulus of the torus. At any given order in s the coefficients of these terms
are given by rational numbers multiplying multiple zeta values (or
Euler--Zagier sums) that, up to the order studied here, reduce to products of
Riemann zeta values. We are careful to disentangle the analytic pieces from
logarithmic threshold terms, which involves a discussion of the conditions
imposed by unitarity. We further consider the compactification of the amplitude
on a circle of radius r, which results in a plethora of terms that are
power-behaved in r. These coefficients provide boundary `data' that must be
matched by any non-perturbative expression for the low-energy expansion of the

our study revealed two important properties: (i) no dense molecular gas is
detected immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the BEK and (ii) the
molecular clump detected very close to the radiocontinuum maximum is probably
located in the foreground along the line of sight and has not yet been reached

absence of molecular emission eastwards of the BEK border of Puppis A. Either
the shock front has completely engulfed and destroyed a molecular clump or the
shock front is interacting with part of a larger cloud and we do not detect CO
emission immediately beyond it because the molecules have been dissociated by
photodissociation and by reactions with photoionized material due to the
radiative precursor.

theoretically possible via several different mechanisms. However, since no
unambiguous verification has been demonstrated experimentally, the question of
finding a viable mechanism for pumping remains open. Here we study quantum
pumping in an one dimensional electron waveguide with a single time-dependent
barrier. The quantum pumping of electrons using a potential barrier whose
height and position are harmonically varied is analyzed analytically and by
numerically solving the time-dependent Schr{\""o}dinger equation. The pumped
charge is modeled analytically by including two contributions in linear
response theory. First, the scattering of electrons off a potential moving
slowly through matter-waves gives a contribution independent of the
translational velocity of the potential. Second, Doppler-shifted scattering
events give rise to a velocity dependent contribution, which is found in
general to be small in comparison with the first one. The relative phase
between the oscillations of the height and position is found to be the factor
that determines to what extent either contribution is present.

Because anyone of these anomalies would be relevant in a cosmological context,
we carried out an extensive analysis of the probabilities quoted in that

  METHODS. We determine the nature and redshift of a subsample of 30 sources in
that catalogue by analysing their optical spectra (another 11 candidates were
identified from existing public databases). These have allowed us to
statistically check the reliability of the probabilities QSO status quoted by

the path integral of the quark transport parameter $\hat q_F$ which can also be

density in the nuclear medium. We further show that contributions from
higher-twist nucleon gluon distributions can be resummed under the extended

of accreting pre-main-sequence stars (CTTSs), we explore the role of stellar
winds in torquing down the stars. For this mechanism to be effective, the
stellar winds need to have relatively high outflow rates, and thus would likely
be powered by the accretion process itself. Here, we use numerical
magnetohydrodynamical simulations to compute detailed 2-dimensional
(axisymmetric) stellar wind solutions, in order to determine the spin down
torque on the star. We explore a range of parameters relevant for CTTSs,
including variations in the stellar mass, radius, spin rate, surface magnetic
field strength, the mass loss rate, and wind acceleration rate. We also
consider both dipole and quadrupole magnetic field geometries.
  Our simulations indicate that the stellar wind torque is of sufficient
magnitude to be important for spinning down a ``typical'' CTTS, for a mass loss
rate of $\sim 10^{-9} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The winds are wide-angle,
self-collimated flows, as expected of magnetic rotator winds with moderately
fast rotation. The cases with quadrupolar field produce a much weaker torque
than for a dipole with the same surface field strength, demonstrating that
magnetic geometry plays a fundamental role in determining the torque. Cases
with varying wind acceleration rate show much smaller variations in the torque
suggesting that the details of the wind driving are less important. We use our
computed results to fit a semi-analytic formula for the effective Alfv\'en
radius in the wind, as well as the torque. This allows for considerable
predictive power, and is an improvement over existing approximations.

carry off orders of magnitude more angular momentum than can be transferred to
the disk, provided that the mass outflow rates are greater than the solar wind.
Thus, the equilibrium spin state is simply characterized by a balance between
the angular momentum deposited by accretion and that extracted by a stellar
wind. We derive a semi-analytic formula for predicting the equilibrium spin
rate as a function only of the ratio of $\dot M_{\rm w} / \dot M_{\rm a}$ and a
dimensionless magnetization parameter, $\Psi \equiv B_*^2 R_*^2 (\dot M_{\rm a}

explains spin rates of $\sim 10$% of breakup speed for $\dot M_{\rm w} / \dot

the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant

radiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal as
they collapse, and this favors fragmentation into stars <~1 Msun. Heating of a
cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow
formation of massive stars, but what properties a cloud must have to form
massive stars, and thus where massive stars form in a galaxy, has not yet been
determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities >~ 1 g cm^-2
can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the
environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that it
implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities of massive star
clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of Halpha and UV

equivalent width upper limits in four of the seven DLAs are a factor of 4-10
times below the 6284 DIB equivalent widths observed in the Milky Way, but are
not inconsistent with those present in the Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the
Galactic DIB-E(B-V) relation, we determine reddening upper limits for the DLAs
in our sample. Based upon the E(B-V) limits, the gas-to-dust ratios,
N(HI)/E(B-V), of the four aforementioned DLAs are at least 5 times higher than
that of the Milky Way ISM. The ratios of two other DLAs are at least a factor
of a few times higher. The best constraints on reddening derive from the upper
limits for the 5780 and 6284 DIBs, which yield E(B-V)<0.08 for four of the
seven DLAs. Our results suggest that, in DLAs, quantities related to dust, such
as reddening and metallicity, appear to have a greater impact on DIB strengths
than does HI gas abundance; the organic molecules likely responsible for DIBs
in DLA selected sightlines are underabundant relative to sightlines in the
Galaxy of similarly high N(HI). With regards to the study of astrobiology, this
could have implications for the abundance of organic molecules in redshifted
galaxies. However, since DLAs are observed to have low reddening, selection
bias likely plays a role in the apparent underabundance of DIBs in DLAs.

infrared-luminous galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), selected by a
deep 70 micron survey with the Multiband Imaging Photometer on Spitzer (MIPS).
In addition and with reference to starburst-type Spectral Energy Distributions
(SEDs), we derive a set of equations for estimating the total infrared
luminosity (L_IR) in the range 8-1000 microns using photometry from at least
one MIPS band. 42 out of 43 of our sources' optical/infrared SEDs
(lambda_observed < 160 microns) are starburst-type, with only one object
displaying a prominent power-law near-infrared continuum. For a quantitative
analysis, models of radiation transfer in dusty media are fit onto the infrared
photometry, revealing that the majority of galaxies are represented by high
extinction, A_v>35 and for a large fraction (~50 per cent) the SED turns over
into the Rayleigh-Jeans regime at wavelengths longward of 90 microns. For
comparison, we also fit semi-empirical templates based on local galaxy data,
however, these underestimate the far-infrared SED shape by a factor of at least
2 and in extreme cases up to 10 for the majority (~70 per cent) of the sources.
Further investigation of SED characteristics reveals that the mid-infrared
(70/24 microns) continuum slope is decoupled from various galaxy properties
such as the total infrared luminosity and far-infrared peak, quantified by the
L_160/L_70 ratio. In view of these results, we propose that these high-redshift
galaxies have different properties to their local counterparts, in the sense
that large amounts of dust cause heavy obscuration and are responsible for an
additional cold emissive component, appearing as a far-infrared excess in their
SEDs.

function that appears in the network calculus to express the service available
to a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a
sequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of

in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further
mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of
estimating available bandwidth from measurement of network probes are related
to potential non-linearities of the underlying network. When networks are
viewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a non-linear regime, it
is argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the
network crosses from a linear to a non-linear regime. Experiments on the Emulab
testbed at the University of Utah evaluate the robustness of the system

also OI columns. We perform in parallel the same comparisons for available FeII
data. We find a significant correlation between TiII/HI and D/H in our data
set, and, when combined with published results, we confirm and better constrain
a previously published trend and extend it to low HI columns. We exclude
uncertainties in HI and OI columns as the main contributor to the derived
metals-deuterium correlations by showing that the TiII/HI ratio is positively
correlated with DI/OI. We find a similar correlation between FeII/HI and
DI/OI.The TiII gradients are similar or slightly smaller than for FeII, while
one would expect larger variations on the basis of the higher condensation
temperature of titanium. However we argue that ionisation effects introduce
biases that affect iron and not titanium and may explain the gradient
similarity. We find a less significant negative correlation between the TiII/DI
ratio and the hydrogen column, possibly a sign of different evaporation of D

can be sent when the parties have access to side-information which is maximally

also allows one to classify states not only in terms of how much quantum
communication is needed to transfer half of it, but also in terms of how much
entanglement is needed. Furthermore, there is a dual paradigm: if one
distributes the side-information as maliciously as possible so as to make the

give interpretations to known quantities (such as the entanglement of

measured size trends of the pressure-induced phase transition. Reproduction of
the measured size and pressure dependence of the phase stability for CdSe,

from the perspective of atomic cohesive energy and its response to the external

levels that carry the ring's oscillator strength. In an excitonic
representation, these levels are associated with the second and the third
lowest electronic excitations of the ring. We will assume that qubits form a
closed loop lattice and the interaction between qubits is only due to the
exchange effect. As we will show, eigenstates are constructed in a such way
that as we subsequently divide qubits of the Rs. molischianum LH-II ring into
the subsystem A consisting of only one qubit and the subsystem B consisting of
the remaining qubits, respective entropies of entanglement increase until the
value of 1 for the maximally entangled state (bipartite system) is reached.
Since the Hamiltonian in essence introduces a two-level approximation for the
LH-II ring, we will go one step further and assume that interactions between
qubits closed loop lattices and an electromagnetic field are described by the
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This assumption is interesting by itself, since it
leads to behavior where the qubits lattice and field oscillate back and fourth
exchanging a quantum of energy, at the Rabbi frequency. This opens a
challenging opportunity to experimentally study the Rs. molischianum LH-II ring
in the regime of cavity QED.

deformation, significantly more heat is produced locally. In natural faults
such regions could be nucleation patches for melt production and hence
potentially initiate weakening during earthquakes at much smaller sliding

sharp for some revlex term orders. For $(m\times n)$-transportation polytopes,
a similar result holds: they have Gr\""obner bases of at most degree $\lfloor

accretion rate for AGN, including low luminosity AGN ($L_{H\alpha}<10^{41}{\rm

properties of final and intermediate values. One may need to guarantee that a
value stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value
is well bounded. Such work may require several lines of proof for each line of
code, and will usually be broken by the smallest change to the code (e.g. for
maintenance or optimization purpose). Certifying these programs by hand is
therefore very tedious and error-prone. This article discusses the use of the
Gappa proof assistant in this context. Gappa has two main advantages over
previous approaches: Its input format is very close to the actual C code to
validate, and it automates error evaluation and propagation using interval
arithmetic. Besides, it can be used to incrementally prove complex mathematical
properties pertaining to the C code. Yet it does not require any specific
knowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus is accessible to a wide
community. Moreover, Gappa may generate a formal proof of the results that can
be checked independently by a lower-level proof assistant like Coq, hence
providing an even higher confidence in the certification of the numerical code.
The article demonstrates the use of this tool on a real-size example, an
elementary function with correctly rounded output.

larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than

phenomena can be explained with a model in which self-citation acts as a
promotion mechanism for external citations. In this article we show that for

generally the power law exponents are higher for self-citations as compared to

higher performance groups and this fraction decreases more rapidly with
increasing journal impact than for lower performance groups. An interesting
novel finding is that the variance in the correlation of the number of

similar features to maps of other rapidly rotating T Tauri stars, i.e. a polar
spot with more spots extending out of it down to equator. Comparison of the two
maps was carried out to measure the differential rotation. Cross-correlation
and parameter fitting indicates that TWA 6 does not have detectable

solution, at 350 8C and 50 MPa of differential stress. Stereoscopic analysis of
pairs of SEM images yielded a digital elevation model of the surface of the
microstylolites. Fourier analyses of these microstylolites reveal a self-affine
roughness (with a roughness exponent H of 1.2). Coupled with observations of
close interactions between dissolution pits and stylolitic peaks, these data
illustrate a possible mechanism for stylolite formation. The complex geometry
of stylolite surfaces is imposed by the interplay between the development of
dissolution peaks in preferential locations (fast dissolution pits) and the
mechanical properties of the solid-fluid-solid interfaces. Simple mechanical
modeling expresses the crucial competition that could rule the development of
microstylolites: (i) a stress-related process, modeled in terms of the
stiffness of springs that activate the heterogeneous dissolution rates of the
solid interface, promotes the deflection. In parallel, (ii) the strength of the
solid interface, modeled in terms of the stiffness of a membrane, is equivalent
to a surface tension that limits the deflection and opposes its development.
The modeling produces stylolitic surfaces with characteristic geometries
varying from conical to columnar when both the effect of dissolution-rate
heterogeneity and the strength properties of the rock are taken into account. A
self-affine roughness exponent (Hz1.2) measured on modeled surfaces is
comparable with natural stylolites at small length scale and experimental
microstylolites.

  pressure solution creep in limestone: Preliminary results",,"Oil & Gas Science and Technology 60 (2005) 381-399",,,"physics.geo-ph",,"  When carbon dioxide (CO2) is injected into an aquifer or a depleted
geological reservoir, its dissolution into solution results in acidification of
the pore waters. As a consequence, the pore waters become more reactive, which
leads to enhanced dissolution-precipitation processes and a modification of the
mechanical and hydrological properties of the rock. This effect is especially
important for limestones given that the solubility and reactivity of carbonates
is strongly dependent on pH and the partial pressure of CO2. The main mechanism
that couples dissolution, precipitation and rock matrix deformation is commonly
referred to as intergranular pressure solution creep (IPS) or pervasive
pressure solution creep (PSC). This process involves dissolution at
intergranular grain contacts subject to elevated stress, diffusion of dissolved
material in an intergranular fluid, and precipitation in pore spaces subject to
lower stress. This leads to an overall and pervasive reduction in porosity due
to both grain indentation and precipitation in pore spaces. The percolation of
CO2-rich fluids may influence on-going compaction due to pressure solution and
can therefore potentially affect the reservoir and its long-term CO2 storage
capacity. We aim at quantifying this effect by using a 2D numerical model to
study the coupling between dissolution-precipitation processes, local mass
transfer, and deformation of the rock over long time scales. We show that high
partial pressures of dissolved CO2 (up to 30 MPa) significantly increase the
rates of compaction by a factor of ~ 50 to ~ 75, and also result in a
concomitant decrease in the viscosity of the rock matrix.

analyzed to determine the scaling behavior and calculate a roughness exponent,

of a single Hurst exponent imply strong assumptions on the mathematical
characteristics of the signal: the derivative of the signal (or local
increments) should be stationary and have finite variance. The analysis of the
measured stylolites show that these properties are not always verified
simultaneously. The stylolite profiles show persistence and jumps and several
stylolites are not regular, with alternating regular and irregular portions. A
new statistical method is proposed here, based on a non-stationary but Gaussian
model, to estimate the roughness of the profiles and quantify the heterogeneity
of stylolites. This statistical method is based on two parameters: the local
roughness (H) which describes the local amplitude of the stylolite, and the
amount of irregularities on the signal (\mu), which can be linked to the
heterogeneities initially present in the rock before the stylolite formed.
Using this technique, a classification of the stylolites in two families is
proposed: those for which the morphology is homogeneous everywhere and those
with alternating regular and irregular portions.

spectrum analysis (APS) of all-sky total intensity maps at 408 MHz and 1420
MHz, which are dominated by synchrotron emission out of the Galactic plane. We
subtract the brighter sources from the maps. We study the APS as a function of
Galactic latitude by considering various cuts and as a function of sky position
by dividing the sky into patches of about 15 deg x 15 deg in size. The APS of
the Galactic radio diffuse synchrotron emission is best fitted by a power law,
$C_{\ell} \sim k \ell^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \in [-3.0,-2.6]$, where the lower
values of $\alpha$ typically correspond to the higher latitudes. Nevertheless,
the analysis of the patches reveals that strong local variations exist. The
mean APS for $\ell \in [20,40]$ is used to determine the mean spectral index
between 408 MHz and 1420 MHz, which is then adopted to extrapolate the
synchrotron APS results to the microwave range. A simple extrapolation to 23
GHz of the synchrotron emission APS found at 408 and 1420 MHz does not explain
all the power in the WMAP synchrotron component even at middle/high Galactic
latitudes. This suggests a significant microwave contribution (of about 50% of
the signal) by other components such as free-free or spinning dust emission.
The comparison between the extrapolated synchrotron APS and the CMB APS shows
that a mask excluding the regions with $|b_{gal}| \lesssim 5^{\circ}$ would
reduce the foreground fluctuations to about half of the cosmological ones at 70
GHz even at the lowest multipoles. We discuss the main implications of our
analysis for the cosmological exploitation of microwave temperature anisotropy
maps.

reactor, thereby allowing the dissolution reactions to occur at a fixed pH and
at constant, but variable saturation states. Preliminary results indicate that
at far-from-equilibrium conditions, the dissolution kinetics of albite are
defined by a rate plateau, with R \approx 5.0 x 10^{-10} mol m^{-2} s^{-1} at
-70 < \Delta G < -40 kJ mol^{-1}. At \Delta G > -40 kJ mol^{-1}, the rates
decrease sharply, revealing a strong inverse relation between the dissolution
rate and free energy. Based on the experiments carried out to date, the
dissolution rate-free energy data correspond to a highly non-linear and
sigmoidal relation, in accord with recent studies.

(May/June 2008)",,"10.1063/1.2832348",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We provide a simple explanation, based on an effective field, for the
precession damping rate due to the spin-orbit interaction. Previous effective
field treatments of spin-orbit damping include only variations of the state
energies with respect to the magnetization direction, an effect referred to as
the breathing Fermi surface. Treating the interaction of the rotating spins
with the orbits as a perturbation, we include also changes in the state
populations in the effective field. In order to investigate the quantitative
differences between the damping rates of iron, cobalt, and nickel, we compute
the dependence of the damping rate on the density of states and the spin-orbit
parameter. There is a strong correlation between the density of states and the
damping rate. The intraband terms of the damping rate depend on the spin-orbit
parameter cubed while the interband terms are proportional to the spin-orbit
parameter squared. However, the spectrum of band gaps is also an important
quantity and does not appear to depend in a simple way on material parameters.

suggests that this may be possible.

relativity is a technique for generating families of initial data sets which
potentially would allow to interpolate between distinct spacetimes. This idea
has been around since the appearance of the Ricci flow on the scene, but it has
been difficult to turn it into a sound mathematical procedure. In this
expository talk we illustrate, how Perelman's recent results in Ricci flow
theory can considerably improve on such a situation. From a physical point of
view this analysis can be related to the issue of finding a constant-curvature
template spacetime for the inhomogeneous Universe, relevant to the
interpretation of observational data and, hence, bears relevance to the dark
energy and dark matter debates. These techniques provide control on curvature
fluctuations (intrinsic backreaction terms) in their relation to the averaged
matter distribution.
