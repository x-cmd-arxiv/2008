slurries containing calcium and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a complex process of
considerable importance in the ecological, geochemical and biological areas.
Moreover, the demand for powdered CaCO3 has increased considerably recently in
various fields of industry. The aim of this study was therefore to synthesize
fine particles of calcite with controlled morphology by hydrothermal
carbonation of calcium hydroxide at high CO2 pressure (initial PCO2=55 bar) and
at moderate and high temperature (30 and 90 degrees C). The morphology of
precipitated particles was identified by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM/EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). In addition, an X-ray
diffraction analysis was performed to investigate the carbonation efficiency
and purity of the solid product. Carbonation of dispersed calcium hydroxide in
the presence of supercritical (PT=90 bar, T=90 degrees C) or gaseous (PT=55
bar, T=30 degrees C) CO2 led to the precipitation of sub-micrometric isolated
particles (<1$\mu$m) and micrometric agglomerates (<5$\mu$m) of calcite. For
this study, the carbonation efficiency (Ca(OH)2-CaCO3 conversion) was not
significantly affected by PT conditions after 24 h of reaction. In contrast,
the initial rate of calcium carbonate precipitation increased from 4.3 mol/h in
the ""90bar-90 degrees C"" system to 15.9 mol/h in the ""55bar-30 degrees C""
system. The use of high CO2 pressure may therefore be desirable for increasing
the production rate of CaCO3, carbonation efficiency and purity, to
approximately 48 kg/m3h, 95% and 96.3%, respectively in this study. The
dissipated heat for this exothermic reaction was estimated by calorimetry to be
-32 kJ/mol in the ""90bar-90 degrees C"" system and -42 kJ/mol in the ""55bar-30
degrees C"" system.

the likelihood function for a theory spectrum given a set of observed

temperature-only analysis, however they cannot reliably handle a
temperature-polarization correlations. We give a new general approximation

spectrum estimators. We show with simulations that it is good enough to obtain
correct results at ell >~ 30 where an exact calculation becomes impossible. We

nonlinear, degenerate, dispersive wave equation may be derived to describe the
evolution of $\phi$, the fraction of molten rock by volume, in the Earth. These
equations have two power nonlinearities which specify the constitutive
realitions for bulk viscosity and permeability in terms of $\phi$. Previously,
they have been shown to admit solitary wave solutions. For a particular
relation between exponents, we observe the equation to be Hamiltonian; it can
be viewed as a generalization of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney equation.
  We prove that the solitary waves are nonlinearly stable, by showing that they
are constrained local minimizers of an appropriate time-invariant Lyapunov
functional. A consequence is an extension of the regime of global in time
well-posedness for this class of equations to (large) data, which include a
neighborhood of a solitary wave. Finally, we observe that these equations have

also affects the mass-loss process, most obviously in the formation of dust

the wave scattering by periodic modulations of the dielectric function and by
its random inhomogeneities. We resolve this difficulty by approaching this
problem from the standpoint of the general multiple scattering theory in media

asymptotic solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in order to show that for a
sufficiently weak disorder the diffusion limit in disordered photonic crystals
is presented by incoherent superpositions of the modes of the ideal structure
with weights inversely proportional to the respective group velocities. The
radiative transfer and the diffusion equations are derived as a relaxation of
long-scale deviations from this limiting distribution. In particular, it is
shown that in general the diffusion is anisotropic unless the crystal has
sufficiently rich symmetry, say, the square lattice in 2D or the cubic lattice
in 3D. In this case, the diffusion is isotropic and only in this case the
effect of the disorder can be characterized by the single mean-free-path

convection around the magnetic poles for more evolved Ap stars. Suppression of
convection is expected to be essential for the opacity mechanism acting in the
hydrogen ionisation zone to drive the high-overtone roAp pulsations
efficiently. Our null-results suggest that the more evolved roAp stars may

or an active knot, called HST-1, tens of parsec away. We explore the
possibility that the TeV emission of M87 is produced in the misaligned subpc
scale jet. We base our modelling on a structured jet, with a fast spine
surrounded by a slower layer. In this context the main site responsible for the
emission of the TeV radiation is the layer, while the (debeamed) spine accounts
for the emission from the radio to the GeV band: therefore we expect a more
complex correlation with the TeV component than that expected in one-zone

from small angles, the spine would dominate the emission, with an overall

  Methods: Visibility data of S Ori were obtained at phase 0.78 with the
VLTI/AMBER instrument using the fringe tracker FINITO at 29 spectral channels
between 1.29 and 2.32 mu. Apparent uniform disk (UD) diameters were computed
for each spectral channel. In addition, the visibility data were directly
compared to predictions by recent self-excited dynamic model atmospheres.
  Results: S Ori shows significant variations in the visibility values as a
function of spectral channel that can only be described by a clear variation in
the apparent angular size with wavelength. The closure phase values are close
to zero at all spectral channels, indicating the absence of asymmetric
intensity features. The apparent UD angular diameter is smallest at about 1.3
and 1.7 mu and increases by a factor of ~1.4 around 2.0 mu. The minimum UD
angular diameter is 8.1 pm 0.5 mas, corresponding to ~420 R_sun. The S Ori
visibility data and the apparent UD variations can be explained reasonably well
by a dynamic atmosphere model that includes molecular layers.

wavelength resemble and generally confirm the predictions by recent dynamic
model atmospheres. [abridged]

measured core radius increases by a factor of two and the central surface
density in all filters of a segregated cluster will be overestimated by a
similar factor when not taking into account mass segregation in the conversion
from light to mass. We find that the $V-I$ colour of mass segregated clusters
decreases with radius by about 0.1-0.2 mag, which could be observable. From
recent observations of partially resolved extra-galactic clusters a decreasing
half-light radius with increasing wavelength was observed, which was attributed
to mass segregation. These observations can not be reproduced by our models. We
find that the differences between measured radii in different filters are
always smaller than 5%.

decode-and-forward relays operating in orthogonal channels. We investigate
distributed power allocation strategies for this system with limited channel
state information at the source and the relay nodes. We first propose a
distributed decision mechanism for each relay to individually make its decision
on whether to forward the source data. The decision mechanism calls for each
relay that is able to decode the information from the source to compare its
relay-to-destination channel gain with a given threshold. We identify the
optimum distributed power allocation strategy that minimizes the total transmit
power while providing a target signal-to-noise ratio at the destination with a
target outage probability. The strategy dictates the optimum choices for the
source power as well as the threshold value at the relays. Next, we consider
two simpler distributed power allocation strategies, namely the passive source
model where the source power and the relay threshold are fixed, and the single
relay model where only one relay is allowed to forward the source data. These
models are motivated by limitations on the available channel state information
as well as ease of implementation as compared to the optimum distributed
strategy. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed distributed power allocation schemes. Specifically, we observe
significant power savings with proposed methods as compared to random relay
selection.

disk galaxy population since z=1, and a brief discussion of a few open
questions. Galaxy evolution surveys have found that the disk galaxy population
forms stars intensely at intermediate redshift. In particular, they dominate
the cosmic star formation rate at z<1 -- the factor of ten drop in cosmic
average comoving star formation rate in the last 8 Gyr is driven primarily by
disk physics, not by a decreasing major merger rate. Despite this intense star
formation, there has been little change in the stellar mass density in disk
galaxies since z=1; large numbers of disk galaxies are being transformed into
non-star-forming spheroid-dominated galaxies by galaxy interactions, AGN
feedback, environmental effects, and other physical processes. Finally, despite
this intense activity, the scaling relations of disk galaxies appear to evolve
little. In particular, as individual galaxies grow in mass through the
formation of stars, they appear to grow in radius (on average, the population
grows inside-out), and they appear to evolve towards somewhat higher rotation
velocity (i.e., mass is added at both small and large radii during this
inside-out growth).

in low-density environments, shed light on the substellar domain, and could
have played an important role in the recent history of the local interstellar

their relation to other young stellar groups and structures in the local
interstellar medium, thus casting new light on recent star formation processes
in the solar neighbourhood. Methods: We compiled the data published in the
literature for young local associations. Using a realistic Galactic potential
we integrated the orbits for these associations and the Sco-Cen complex back in
time. Results: Combining these data with the spatial structure of the Local
Bubble and the spiral structure of the Galaxy, we propose a recent history of
star formation in the solar neighbourhood. We suggest that both the Sco-Cen
complex and young local associations originated as a result of the impact of
the inner spiral arm shock wave against a giant molecular cloud. The core of
the giant molecular cloud formed the Sco-Cen complex, and some small cloudlets
in a halo around the giant molecular cloud formed young local associations
several million years later. We also propose a supernova in young local
associations a few million years ago as the most likely candidate to have
reheated the Local Bubble to its present temperature.

refraction by random currents. Proper handling of the non-uniform sampling
results in greatly increased probability of freak wave formation. The present

others present typical L_X/L_BOL ratios, suggesting that several O-type objects
are actually binaries. Variability at the ~2sigma level was detected for a
majority of the sources, of unknown origin for the putatively single objects.
Faint, soft, diffuse emission pervades the entire field-of-view but no clear
structure can be identified, even at the position of a blister proposed to be
at the origin of the TeV source HESS J1023-575. Finally, the X-ray properties
of PMS objects were also investigated, in particular the brightest flaring
ones. They provided an additional argument in favor of a large distance (~8kpc)
for the cluster.

photometric survey over 16 sq.deg. around the cluster center, followed up with
K-band photometry to measure the proper motion of candidate members, and
optical and near-IR spectroscopy of probable BD and VLM members. We report the
discovery of the first 2 brown dwarfs in the Hyades cluster. The 2 objects have
a spectral type early-T and their optical and near-IR photometry as well as
their proper motion are consistent with them being cluster members. According
to models, their mass is 50 Jupiter masses at an age of 625 Myr. We also report
the discovery of 3 new very low mass stellar members of the cluster, and
confirm the membership of 16 others. We combine these results with a list of
previously known cluster members to build the present-day mass function (PDMF)
of the Hyades cluster from 50 Jupiter masses to 3Mo. We find the Hyades PDMF to
be strongly deficient in very low mass objects and brown dwarfs compared to the
IMF of younger open clusters such as the Pleiades. We interpret this deficiency
as the result of dynamical evolution over the past few 100 Myr, i.e., the
preferential evaporation of low mass cluster members due to weak gravitational
encounters. We thus estimate that the Hyades cluster currently hosts about
10-15 brown dwarfs, while its initial substellar population may have amounted

collisionally excited emission lines such as[O I],[C I],and [Fe II]. aim: The
goal is to determine the location of the H_2 and [Fe II] shock emission, to
determine the shock velocities,and constrain the physical properties in the
shock. methods: High resolution spectra of the H_2 1-0 S(1),H_2 2-1 S(1), [Fe
II], and Pa$\beta$ emission lines were obtained with the near infrared
spectrograph Phoenix on Gemini South. results: The position-velocity diagrams
of H_2 1-0 S(1), H_2 2-1 S(1), and [Fe II] are presented. The H_2 and [Fe II]
emission is spatially extended. The collisionally excited [O I] and [C I]
optical emission lines have a similar double peaked profile compared to the
extracted H_2 profile and appear to be produced in the same shock. They all
indicate an expansion velocity of ~8 km/s and the presence of a neutral, very
high density region with $n_{\rm e}$ about 3 x 10^6 to 5 x10^7 cm$^{-3}$. The
[Fe II] emission however is single peaked. It has a gaussian FWHM of 30 km/s
and a total width of 62 km/s at 1% of the peak. The Pa$\beta$ profile is even
wider with a gaussian FWHM of 48 km/s and a total width of 75 km/s at 1% of the
peak. conclusions: The H$_2$ emission is excited in a slow 5 to 20 km/s shock
into dense material at the edge of the lobes, caused by the interaction of the
AGB ejecta and the post-AGB wind. The 3D representation of the H_2 data shows a
hollow structure with less H_2 emission in the equatorial region. The [Fe II]
emission is not present in the lobes, but originates close to the central star

to recover the input parameters with classical Fourier techniques and
investigated the error as a function of the relative level of noise, signal and

less than the classical frequency resolution and that the realistic frequency

Furthermore, for a certain hole position a saturation value in the decay that
can be tuned arbitrarily by varying the eccentricity of the ellipse is observed
and explained. When applying harmonic boundary oscillations this saturation
value caused by librator type orbits is gradually destroyed via two fundamental
processes which are discussed in detail. As a result, an amplitude dependent
emission rate is obtained in the long time behavior of the decay, suggesting
that the driven elliptical billiard can be used as a controllable source of
particles.

is characterized by the experimentally measurable parameter R defined as the

representation, this parameter is found as a function of the pump-pulse
duration. This function is shown to have a minimum and even in the minimum, at
rather natural conditions, the parameter R is found to be very high (R=73>>1).
The Schmidt number K is found for both short and long pump pulses and
interpolated for arbitrary pulse durations. All functional dependences of R and
K are found to be identical and numerical difference between them is shown to
be not exceeding 20%. Two-time temporal wave function of a biphoton state is
investigated in details, and a rather significant difference between the cases
of short and long pump pulses is found to occur. In the case of long pulses,
the temporal parameter R is defined as the ratio of durations of the

has been used over the past three decades to measure the mobility of
macromolecules and protein transport and interaction with immobile structures
inside the cell nucleus. A theoretical model is presented that aims to describe
protein transport inside the nucleus, a process which is influenced by the
presence of a boundary (i.e. membrane). A set of reaction-diffusion equations
is employed to model both the diffusion of proteins and their interaction with
immobile binding sites. The proposed model has been designed to be applied to
biological samples with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) equipped
with the feature to bleach regions characterised by a scanning beam that has a
radially Gaussian distributed profile. The proposed model leads to FRAP curves
that depend on the on- and off-rates. Semi-analytical expressions are used to
define the boundaries of on- (off-) rate parameter space in simplified cases
when molecules move within a bounded domain. The theoretical model can be used
in conjunction to experimental data acquired by CLSM to investigate the
biophysical properties of proteins in living cells.

spallation. Its motivation is based on experimental final-state observations of
one heavy nucleus, a small number of light fragments and numerous individual
nucleons. It is theoretically described as two step process involving energy
deposition in the target nucleus and subsequent evaporation. Several models,
based on different assumptions, have been constructed in order to describe the
spallation process. The main subject of this work is description of global
average properties of proton induced spallation reactions in wide range of
projectile energy (0.1 - 10 GeV) and mass of target nuclei. This is
investigated within Hadron String Dynamics (HSD) model, based on Boltzmann -
Uehling - Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation, supplemented by a statistical evaporation
model for the second stage of the reaction. It has been shown that spallation
is the most probable scenario of proton - nucleus reaction. Proton induced
reactions, in considered here incident energy range, are visibly non-invasive
processes. Properties of residual nuclei after the first stage of the reaction
are weakly dependent on incident energy, but strongly dependent on mass of
target. The second stage of the reaction is a competition of evaporation and
fission. Results obtained from the HSD model vary smoothly as function of
proton incident energy and mass of target, so interpolation of the results is
quite feasible.
