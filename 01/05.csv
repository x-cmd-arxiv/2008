the VLBA 2 cm Survey and MOJAVE monitoring programs. This major event allows us
to study a variety of processes associated with outbursts of radio-loud AGN in
much greater detail than has been possible in other cases: the primary
perturbation gives rise to the formation of a leading and a following
component, which are interpreted as a forward and a backward-shock. Both
components evolve in characteristically different ways and allow us to draw
conclusions about the work flow of jet-production events; the expansion,
acceleration and recollimation of the ejected jet plasma in an environment with
steep pressure and density gradients are revealed; trailing components are
formed in the wake of the primary perturbation possibly as a result of coupling
to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability pinching modes from the interaction of the jet
with the external medium. The interaction of the jet with its ambient medium is
further described by the linear-polarization signature of jet components
traveling along the jet and passing a region of steep pressure/density
gradients.

can produce striking and unusual final states at the LHC. Unparticle models,
hidden-sectors with conformal dynamics and no (or a very small) mass gap, can
result in unusual kinematic features that indirectly reflect the conformal
dynamics. When sufficiently large mass gaps are added to unparticle models,
they become hidden valley models. Predictions using unparticle propagators
alone overlook the most striking signals, which are typically of hidden-valley
type. Inclusive signatures often cannot be predicted from unparticle
dimensions, and exclusive signatures are often visible and can be spectacular.
Among possible signatures are: Higgs decays to pairs of particles that in turn
decay to two quarks, leptons or gauge bosons, possibly with displaced vertices;
Higgs, top, and neutralino decays to more than six particles; resonances below
an ``unparticle'' continuum which produce multi-body final states; etc. The
Stephanov model is deconstructed, reconstructed, and shown to be a hidden
valley model. Some effects of strong dynamics on hidden valley observables, not
predictable using unparticle methods, are discussed, including resonances,
reduced flavor symmetry breaking, reduced supersymmetry breaking, and a

a remarkable coincidence: decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings can
explain both observations if positrons and photons are produced with similar
branching fractions. We illustrate this idea with an unstable branon, which is
a standard WIMP dark matter candidate appearing in brane world models with
large extra dimensions. We show that because branons decay via three-body final
states, they are additionally unconstrained by searches for Galactic MeV
gamma-ray lines. As a result, such unstable long-lifetime dark matter particles
provide novel and distinct signatures that can be tested by future observations
of MeV gamma-rays.

mechanisms that limit the compression. A nonlocal model is derived, and the
nonlocal response is shown to have an additional oscillatory component in the
nonstationary regime when the group-velocity mismatch (GVM) is strong. This
inhibits efficient compression. Raman-like perturbations from the cascaded
nonlinearity, competing cubic nonlinearities, higher-order dispersion, and
soliton energy may also limit compression, and through realistic numerical
simulations we point out when each factor becomes important. We find that it is
theoretically possible to reach the single-cycle regime by compressing
high-energy fs pulses for wavelengths $\lambda=1.0-1.3 \mu{\rm m}$ in a
$\beta$-barium-borate crystal, and it requires that the system is in the
stationary regime, where the phase mismatch is large enough to overcome the
detrimental GVM effects. However, the simulations show that reaching
single-cycle duration is ultimately inhibited by competing cubic nonlinearities
as well as dispersive waves, that only show up when taking higher-order
dispersion into account.

with structural subtyping. Subtyping systems typically have two presentations,
which should be equivalent: a declarative version in which the subsumption rule
may be used anywhere, and an algorithmic version in which the use of
subsumption is limited in order to make typechecking syntax-directed and
decidable. However, the XQuery standard type system circumvents this issue by
using imprecise typing rules for iteration constructs and defining only
algorithmic typechecking, and another extant proposal provides more precise
types for iteration constructs but ignores subtyping. In this paper, we
consider a core XQuery-like language with a subsumption rule and prove the
completeness of algorithmic typechecking; this is straightforward for XQuery
proper but requires some care in the presence of more precise iteration typing
disciplines. We extend this result to an XML update language we have introduced

axes a > 0.2 AU is very uniform, and values for e are relatively large,
averaging 0.3 and broadly distributed up to near 1. For a < 0.2 AU,
eccentricities are much smaller (most e < 0.2), a characteristic widely
attributed to damping by tides after the planets formed and the protoplanetary
gas disk dissipated. Most previous estimates of the tidal damping considered
the tides raised on the planets, but ignored the tides raised on the stars.
Most also assumed specific values for the planets' poorly constrained tidal
dissipation parameter Qp. Perhaps most important, in many studies, the strongly
coupled evolution between e and a was ignored. We have now integrated the
coupled tidal evolution equations for e and a over the estimated age of each
planet, and confirmed that the distribution of initial e values of close-in
planets matches that of the general population for reasonable Q values, with
the best fits for stellar and planetary Q being ~10^5.5 and ~10^6.5,
respectively. The accompanying evolution of a values shows most close-in
planets had significantly larger a at the start of tidal migration. The earlier
gas disk migration did not bring all planets to their current orbits. The
current small values of a were only reached gradually due to tides over the
lifetimes of the planets. These results may have important implications for
planet formation models, atmospheric models of ""hot Jupiters"", and the success
of transit surveys.

shown that the reduction of phase fluctuation parameter U can be seen in
different intermediate states, such as binomial state, generalized binomial

various parameters related to intermediate states. Further, we have provided
specific examples of antibunched states, for which $U$ is greater than its

calcite monocrystals were indented at 40 degrees C for six weeks using ceramic
indenters under stresses in the 50-200 MPa range in a saturated solution of
calcite and in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl. The deformation
(depth of the hole below the indenter) is measured ex-situ at the end of the
experiment. In the second type of experiment, calcite monocrystals were
indented by spherical glass indenters for 200 hours under stresses in the 0-100
MPa range at room temperature in a saturated aqueous solution of calcite. The
displacement of the indenter was continuously recorded using a specially
constructed differential dilatometer. The experiments conducted in a
calcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl show an enhanced indentation rate
owing to the fairly high solubility of calcite in this solution. In contrast,
the experiments conducted in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution show moderate
indentation rate and the dry control experiments did not show any measurable
deformation. The rate of calcite indentation is found to be inversely
proportional to the indenter diameter, thus indicating that the process is
diffusion-controlled. The microcracks in the dissolution region under the
indenter dramatically enhance the rate of calcite indentation by a significant
reduction of the distance of solute transport in the trapped fluid phase. This
result indicates that care should be taken in extrapolating the kinetic data of
pressure solution creep from one mineral to another.

consequence of our methods, we obtain sharp or near sharp results on the
distribution of volumes determined by subsets of vector spaces over finite
fields and the associated arithmetic expressions.
  In particular, our machinery enables us to prove that if $E \subset {\Bbb
F}_q^d$, $d \ge 4$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field ${\Bbb
F}_q$, of size much greater than $q^{\frac{d}{2}}$, and if $E$ is a product
set, then the set of volumes of $d$-dimensional parallelepipeds determined by
$E$ covers ${\Bbb F}_q$. This result is sharp as can be seen by taking $E$ to
equal to $A \times A \times ... \times A$, where $A$ is a sub-field of ${\Bbb
F}_q$ of size $\sqrt{q}$. In three dimensions we establish the same result if
$|E| \gtrsim q^{{15/8}}$. We prove in three dimensions that the set of volumes
covers a positive proportion of ${\Bbb F}_q$ if $|E| \ge Cq^{{3/2}}$. Finally
we show that in three dimensions the set of volumes covers a positive
proportion of ${\Bbb F}_q$ if $|E| \ge Cq^2$, without any further assumptions
on $E$, which is again sharp as taking $E$ to be a 2-plane through the origin
shows.

during the preheating phase of chaotic inflation using a model consisting of a
massive scalar inflaton field coupled to N massless quantum scalar fields. The
effects of spacetime curvature and interactions between the quantum fields are
ignored. A large N expansion is used to obtain a coupled set of equations
including a backreaction equation for the classical inflaton field. Previous
studies of preheating using these equations have been done. Here the first
numerical solutions to the full set of equations are obtained for various
values of the coupling constant and the initial amplitude of the inflaton
field. States are chosen so that initially the backreaction effects on the
inflaton field are small and the mode equations for the quantum fields take the
form of Mathieu equations. Potential problems relating to the parametric
amplification of certain modes of the quantum fields are identified and
resolved. A detailed study of the damping of the inflaton field is undertaken.
Some predictions of previous studies are verified and some new results are
obtained.

145 (80%) show radial velocity (RV) variations at a level >20 m/s, of which 43
exhibit significant periodicities. Our aim is to investigate possible
mechanism(s) that cause these observed RV variations. We intend to test whether
these variations are intrinsic in nature, or possibly induced by companions, or
both. In addition, we aim to characterise the parameters of these companions. A
relation between log g and the amplitude of the RV variations is investigated
for all stars in the sample. Furthermore, the hypothesis that all periodic RV
variations are caused by companions is investigated by comparing their inferred
orbital statistics with the statistics of companions around main sequence
stars. A strong relation is found between the amplitude of the RV variations
and log g in K giant stars, as suggested earlier by Hatzes & Cochran (1998).
However, most of the stars exhibiting periodic variations are located above
this relation. These RV variations can be split in a periodic component which
is not correlated with log g and a random residual part which does correlate
with log g. Compared to main-sequence stars, K giants frequently exhibit
periodic RV variations. Interpreting these RV variations as being caused by
companions, the orbital param eters are different from the companions orbiting
dwarfs. Intrinsic mechanisms play an important role in producing RV variations
in K giants stars, as suggested by their dependence on log g. However, it
appears that periodic RV variations are additional to these intrinsic
variations, consistent with them being caused by companions.

thermalisation and thus explain the (lack of) gravitino production, it is
necessary to explain why complicated directions as $QLQLQLE^c$ are not exited,

photonic band gap structures in the context of negative refraction and
super-resolution in the visible and near infrared ranges. In the resonance
tunneling regime, we find that for transverse-magnetic incident polarization,
field localization effects contribute to a waveguiding phenomenon that makes it
possible for the light to remain confined within a small fraction of a
wavelength, without any transverse boundaries, due to the suppression of
diffraction. This effect is related to negative refraction of the Poynting
vector inside each metal layer, balanced by normal refraction inside the
adjacent dielectric layer: The degree of field localization and material
dispersion together determine the total momentum that resides within any given
layer, and thus the direction of energy flow. We find that the transport of
evanescent wave vectors is mediated by the excitation of quasi-stationary, low
group velocity surface waves responsible for relatively large losses. As
representative examples we consider transparent metallo-dielectric stacks such
as Ag/TiO2 and Ag/GaP and show in detail how to obtain the optimum conditions
for high transmittance of both propagating and evanescent modes for
super-guiding and super resolution applications across the visible and near IR
ranges. Finally, we study the influence of gain on super-resolution. We find
that the introduction of gain can compensate the losses caused by the
excitation of surface plasmons, improves the resolving characteristics of the

abundances due to stellar photospheric effects and not due to natal variations.
In this paper, we compare the elemental abundance patterns of the ultra
metal-poor stars with metallicities [Fe/H] $\sim -5 $ to those of a subclass of
chemically peculiar stars. These include post-AGB stars, RV Tauri variable
stars, and the Lambda Bootis stars, which range in mass, age, binarity, and
evolutionary status, yet can have iron abundance determinations as low as
[Fe/H] $\sim -5$. These chemical peculiarities are interpreted as due to the
separation of gas and dust beyond the stellar surface, followed by the
accretion of dust depleted-gas. Contrary to this, the elemental abundances in
the ultra metal-poor stars are thought to represent yields of the most
metal-poor supernova and, therefore, observationally constrain the earliest
stages of chemical evolution in the Universe. The abundance of the elements in
the photospheres of the ultra metal-poor stars appear to be related to the

panmictic populations, when females (XX) can freely choose the male partner

defects and eventually the only information it brings is a male sex
determination. As a result of shrinking Y chromosome the males become
hemizygous in respect to the X chromosome content and are characterized by
higher mortality, observed also in the human populations. If it is assumed in
the model that the presence of the male is indispensable at least during the
pregnancy of his female partner and he cannot be seduced by another female at
least during the one reproduction cycle - the Y chromosome preserves its
content, does not shrink and the lifespan of females and males is the same.
Thus, Y chromosome shrinks not because of existing in one copy, without the
possibility of recombination, but because it stays under weaker selection
pressure; in panmictic populations without the necessity of being faithful, a
considerable fraction of males is dispensable and they can be eliminated from
the population without reducing its reproduction potential.

messages for function computation at both locations is studied. For any number
of messages, a computable characterization of the rate region is provided in
terms of single-letter information measures. While interaction is useless in
terms of the minimum sum-rate for lossless source reproduction at one or both
locations, the gains can be arbitrarily large for function computation even
when the sources are independent. For a class of sources and functions,
interaction is shown to be useless, even with infinite messages, when a
function has to be computed at only one location, but is shown to be useful, if
functions have to be computed at both locations. For computing the Boolean AND
function of two independent Bernoulli sources at both locations, an achievable
infinite-message sum-rate with infinitesimal-rate messages is derived in terms
of a two-dimensional definite integral and a rate-allocation curve. A general
framework for multiterminal interactive function computation based on an
information exchange protocol which successively switches among different

which may be cosmological redshift (including possibly the host galaxy redshift

not. Here, I enumerate a series of evidences, including three methods, to
determine whether the GRB distance does depend on the redshift. Firstly, the
correlation analysis shows that there is no correlation between the fluence of
131 GRBs (and the 1 s peak photon flux of 111 GRBs) and the redshift although
there is a significant correlation between the apparent magnitude of 32 hosts
and the redshift. Secondly, from the number-redshift relation of GRBs and the
deductive reasoning, one can deduce an absurd conclusion that the probability
of a nearby galaxy generating a GRB event would vary inversely as its distance
square if GRB indeed comes from an external galaxy and the distance depends on
the redshift. Thirdly, if the distance is related to the redshift, then the
variables of fluence and peak flux definitely cannot be separated from the
variable of redshift in distribution functions of both the fluence-redshift and
the peak flux-redshift; while the variables separation tests show that they in
effect do, and we then can exactly forecast the values of the fluence and the
peak flux for the GRBs with redshift z > 4.5. Other evidences all show that GRB
distance is independent from the redshift without exception.

investigated using dielectric measurements. The dielectric relaxation strength
of the DR1-labeled polystyrene is approximately 65 times larger than that of
the unlabeled polystyrene above the glass transition, while there is almost no
difference between them below the glass transition. The glass transition
temperature of the DR1-labeled polystyrene can be determined as a crossover
temperature at which the temperature coefficient of the electric capacitance
changes from the value of the glassy state to that of the liquid state. The
glass transition temperature of the DR1-labeled polystyrene decreases with
decreasing film thickness in a reasonably similar manner to that of the
unlabeled polystyrene thin films. The dielectric relaxation spectrum of the
DR1-labeled polystyrene is also investigated. As thickness decreases, the
$\alpha$-relaxation time becomes smaller and the distribution of the
$\alpha$-relaxation times becomes broader. These results show that thin films
of DR1-labeled polystyrene are a suitable system for investigating confinement
effects of the glass transition dynamics using dielectric relaxation

gas is a gas composed of bosonic scalar field with noncommutative field space

introduced as a generalization of quantum mechanics on a noncommutative
spacetime. As key features of these theories are Lorentz invariance violation
and CPT violation. In the present study we use a noncommutative bosonic field
theory that besides the noncommutative parameter $\theta$ shows up a further
parameter $\sigma$. This parameter $\sigma$ controls the range of the
noncommutativity and acts as a regulator for the theory. Both parameters play a
key role in the modified dispersion relations of the noncommutative bosonic
field, leading to possible striking consequences for phenomenology. In this
work we obtain an equation of state $p=\omega(\sigma,\theta;\beta)\rho$ for the
noncommutative bosonic gas relating pressure $p$ and energy density $\rho$, in
the limit of high temperature. We analyse possible behaviours for this gas

Passive galaxies have strong correlations between mass and metallicity and

downsizing relation between age and mass. For old passive galaxies, the
different trends of M/L with mass and luminosity in different passbands result
from the differential effect of the mass-metallicity relation on the

from the perspectives of bond formation, bond dissociation, bond relaxation,
bond vibration, and the associated charge redistribution and polarization and
the energetic response of the involved atoms and valence electrons. The
sp-orbital hybridization is found necessary for these concerned reactions
associated with strongly anisotropic bonding and valence identities and the
localized energy states of bonding pairs, nonbonding lone pairs, and the lone
pair induced antibonding dipoles, as well as the hydrogen bond like and C-H
bond like states, which could unify the observations using atomistic
microscopy, crystallography, electronic spectroscopy, vibronic spectroscopy,
and thermal desorption spectroscopy and provide guidelines for materials
design.
