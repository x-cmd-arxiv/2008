have undergone relatively recent mergers that may be related to the triggering
of the nuclear activity. We perform two-dimensional modeling of the light
distributions to analyze the host galaxies' morphology. We find that, while
each host galaxy is reasonably well fitted by a de Vaucouleurs profile, the
majority of them (4/5) reveal significant fine structure such as shells and
tidal tails. These structures contribute between ~5% and 10% to the total
V-band luminosity of each host galaxy within a region of r ~ 3 r_eff and are
indicative of merger events that occurred between a few hundred Myr and a Gyr
ago. These timescales are comparable to starburst ages in the QSO hosts
previously inferred from Keck spectroscopy. Our results thus support a
consistent scenario in which most of the QSO host galaxies suffered mergers
with accompanying starbursts that likely also triggered the QSO activity in
some way, but we are also left with considerable uncertainty on physical
mechanisms that might have delayed this triggering for several hundred Myr
after the merger.

beta varies around 2.0 for different fields. In the low field region (below

the vortices, mainly from the superfluid of the pi band. When H>1T, beta drops
abruptly to its lowest value at about 2T because of the proliferation of
quasiparticles from the pi-band and, hence, the motion of the vortices from the
superfluid of the sigma-band dominates the dissipation. As the field is
increased further, the vortex pinning strength is weakened and beta increases
monotonically towards 2.0 at a high field. All the results presented here are
in good agreement with the expectation of the vortex physics of a multi-band

  Methods. We obtained 19 days of continuous high-precision photometry of gamma
Equ with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite. The
data were reduced with two different reduction techniques and significant
frequencies were identified. Those frequencies were fitted by interpolating a
