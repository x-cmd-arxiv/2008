the time of their coalescence due to the emission of gravitational waves (GWs).
We simulate the response of a thin, 2D disk of collisionless particles,
initially on circular orbits around a 10^6 M_sun BHB, to kicks that are either
parallel or perpendicular to the initial orbital plane. Typical kick velocities
(v_k) can exceed the sound speed in a circumbinary gas disk. While the inner
disk is strongly bound to the recoiling binary, the outer disk is only weakly
bound or unbound. This leads to differential motions in the disturbed disk that
increase with radius and can become supersonic at ~700 Schwarzschild radii for
v_k ~500 km/s, implying that shocks form beyond this radius. We indeed find
that kicks in the disk plane lead to immediate strong density enhancements
(within weeks) in a tightly wound spiral caustic, propagating outward at the
speed v_k. Concentric density enhancements are also observed for kicks
perpendicular to the disk, but are weaker and develop into caustics only after
a long delay (>1 year). Unless both BH spins are low or precisely aligned with
the orbital angular momentum, a significant fraction (> several %) of kicks are
sufficiently large and well aligned with the orbital plane for strong shocks to
be produced. The shocks could result in an afterglow whose characteristic
photon energy increases with time, from the UV (~10eV) to the soft X-ray
(~100eV) range, between one month and one year after the merger. This could
help identify EM counterparts to GW sources discovered by LISA.

astonishing outburst that increased its apparent total brightness from
magnitude V\sim17 up to V\sim2.5 in roughly two days. We report on Wendelstein
0.8 m telescope (WST) photometric observations of the early evolution stages of
the outburst. Aims. We studied the evolution of the structure morphology, its
kinematic, and estimated the ejected dust mass. Methods. We analized 126 images
in the BVRI photometric bands spread between 26/10/2007 and 20/11/2007. The
bright comet core appeared well separated from that one of a quickly expanding
dust cloud in all the data, and the bulk of the latter was contained in the
field of view of our instrument. The ejected dust mass was derived on the base
of differential photometry on background stars occulted by the moving cloud.
Results. The two cores were moving apart from each other at a relative
projected constant velocity of (9.87 +/- 0.07) arcsec/day (0.135 +/-0.001
km/sec). In the inner regions of the dust cloud we observed a linear increase
in size at a mean constant velocity of (14.6+/-0.3) arcsec/day (0.200+/-0.004
km/sec). Evidence of a radial velocity gradient in the expanding cloud was also
found. Our estimate for the expanding coma's mass was of the order of 10^{-2}-1
comet's mass implying a significant disintegration event. Conclusions. We
interpreted our observations in the context of an explosive scenario which was
more probably originated by some internal instability processes, rather than an
impact with an asteroidal body. Due to the peculiar characteristics of this
event, further observations and investigations are necessary in order to
enlight the nature of the physical processes that determined it.

alternative to methods based on spectrophotometric indices: it uses all the
redundant information contained in the signal. This paper addresses the
validation of the method and it investigates the quality of the population
models together with the reliability of the fitting procedures. We are using
two algorithms: STECKMAP, a non-parametric regularized program and NBURSTS a
parametric non-linear minimization. We compare three spectral synthesis models
for single stellar populations: Pegase-HR, Galaxev (BC03) and Vazdekis/Miles,
and we analyse spectra of Galactic clusters whose populations are known from
studies of color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and spectroscopy of individual stars.
We find that: (1) The quality of the models critically depends on the stellar
library they use. Pegase-HR and Vazdekis/Miles are consistent, while the
comparison between Pegase-HR and BC03 shows some systematics reflecting the
limitations of the stellar library (STELIB) used to generate the latter models;
(2) The two fitting programs are consistent; (3) For globular clusters and M67
spectra, the method restitutes metallicities in agreement with spectroscopy of
stars within 0.14 dex; (4) The spectroscopic ages are very sensitive to the
presence of a blue horizontal branch (BHB) or of blue stragglers. A BHB
morphology results in a young SSP-equivalent age. Fitting a free amount of blue
stars in addition to the SSP model to mimic the BHB improves and stabilizes the
fit and restores ages in agreement with CMDs studies. This method is
potentially able to disentangle age or BHB effects in extragalactic clusters.

distinction between physics at intergalactic, mechanist, quantum, and smaller
scales. Instead of being a constant (of proportionality of physics at all
scales), G is a parameter of most general form: G = s e^2, nonlinearly varying
amongst different scales s. The so called scale variability of physics but not
of G, imagined as such by Planck and Einstein, is due to springtide-induced
extreme resonance of Earth masses critically impeding terrestrial experiments

different to that of the continuum, which indicates that the
electron-scattering region is not spherically symmetric. The observed long term
changes in the polarimetry can be associated with an axi-symmetric structure,
along the short axis of the extended reflection nebulosity. Long term
photometry reveals that the star increased in temperature until the
mid-nineties, after which the photospheric flux in the optical levelled off. As
the photometric changes are mostly probed in the red, they do not trace high
stellar temperatures sensitively. And so, it is not obvious whether the star
has halted its increase in temperature or not. For HD 179821 we find no
polarization effects across any absorption or emission lines, but observe very
large polarization changes of order 5% over 15 years. Unexpectedly, during the
same period, the optical photometry displayed modest variability at the 0.2
magnitude level. Several explanations for this puzzling fact are discussed.
Most of which, involving asymmetries in the circumstellar material, seem to
fail as there is no evidence for the presence of hot, dusty material close to
the star. Alternatively, the variations can be explained by the presence of a
non-radially pulsating photosphere. Changes in the photometry hint at an
increase in temperature corresponding to a change through two spectral
subclasses over the past ten years.

``size-change principle'' from first-order programs is extended to arbitrary

termination of a single, stand-alone lambda;-expression. The second suffices to
show CBV termination of any member of a regular set of lambda-expressions,
defined by a tree grammar. (A simple example is a minimum function, when
applied to arbitrary Church numerals.) The algorithm is sound and proven so in
this paper. The Halting Problem's undecidability implies that any sound
algorithm is necessarily incomplete: some lambda-expressions may in fact
terminate under CBV evaluation, but not be recognised as terminating.
  The intensional power of the termination algorithm is reasonably high. It
certifies as terminating many interesting and useful general recursive
algorithms including programs with mutual recursion and parameter exchanges,
and Colson's ``minimum'' algorithm. Further, our type-free approach allows use
of the Y combinator, and so can identify as terminating a substantial subset of

been studied in great detail, with observations classifying it as a type 1
white-light flare with a very hard spectrum in hard X-rays. The flare was also
associated with a type II radio burst and coronal mass ejection. The flare
emission characteristics appeared to closely correspond with previous instances
of seismic emission from acoustically active flares. Using standard local
helioseismic methods, we identified the seismic signatures produced by the
flare that, to date, is the least energetic (in soft X-rays) of the flares
known to have generated a detectable acoustic transient. Holographic analysis
of the flare shows a compact acoustic source strongly correlated with the
impulsive hard X-ray, visible continuum, and radio emission. Time-distance
diagrams of the seismic waves emanating from the flare region also show faint
signatures, mainly in the eastern sector of the active region. The strong
spatial coincidence between the seismic source and the impulsive visible
continuum emission reinforces the theory that a substantial component of the
seismic emission seen is a result of sudden heating of the low photosphere
associated with the observed visible continuum emission. Furthermore, the
low-altitude magnetic loop structure inferred from potential--field
extrapolations in the flaring region suggests that there is a significant
inverse correlation between the seismicity of a flare and the height of the

spacetime to study gravitational radiation and backreaction effects. We begin
in this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in
the background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach
utilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the
size of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background
spacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an
effective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet
divergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\it partie finie} to isolate the
non-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is
constructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded
propagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only
logarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the
theory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive
the first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going
beyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the
object, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a
compact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\epsilon^4)$, in
the form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio
of a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white
dwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\epsilon^2)$ process, or
plunges into the supermassive black hole. This work provides a new foundation
for further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitational
radiation and spinning compact objects.

important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of
topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an
insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to
the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise
to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic
field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be
realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of
the quantum well, the band structure changes from a normal to an ""inverted""
type at a critical thickness $d_c$. We present an analytical solution of the
helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We
also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in
HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We review both the fabrication of the sample and
the experimental setup. For thin quantum wells with well width $d_{QW}< 6.3$
nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small
conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells ($d_{QW}>
6.3$ nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual
conductance close to $2e^2/h$. The residual conductance is independent of the
sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the
residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The
quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, $d_c= 6.3$ nm, is also

in the space of the coupling constants, we expand the effective potential up to
third order in the high temperature expansion, and up to sixth order in the

model the SEDs of the stars (compiled from archival data) and compare
circumstellar dust parameters and mass loss rates in different types.
  Our near-infrared spectra show that in the case of M and S type stars, the
equivalent widths of the CO(3-0) band are moderately correlated with infrared
colors, suggesting a possible relationship with mass loss processes. A few PAGB
stars revealed short term variability in their spectra, indicating episodic
mass loss: the cooler stars showed in CO first overtone bands and the hotter
ones showed in HI Brackett lines. Our spectra on IRAS 19399+2312 suggest that
it is a transition object. From the SPITZER spectra, there seems to be a
dependence between the spectral type of the PAGB stars and the strength of the

primary focus is on non-thermal Bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering,
that produce hard X-ray emission. We briefly review acceleration mechanisms and
point out that in most astrophysical situations, and in particular for the
intracluster medium, shocks, turbulence and plasma waves play a crucial role.
We consider two scenarios for production of non-thermal radiation. The first is
hard X-ray emission due to non-thermal Bremsstrahlung by nonrelativistic
particles. Non-thermal tails are produced by accelerating electrons from the
background plasma with an initial Maxwellian distribution. However, these tails
are accompanied by significant heating and they are present for a short time of
<10^6 yr, which is also the time that the tail will be thermalised. Such
non-thermal tails, even if possible, can only explain the hard X-ray but not
the radio emission which needs GeV or higher energy electrons. For these and
for production of hard X-rays by the inverse Compton model, we need the second
scenario where there is injection and subsequent acceleration of relativistic
electrons. It is shown that a steady state situation, for example arising from
secondary electrons produced from cosmic ray proton scattering by background
protons, will most likely lead to flatter than required electron spectra or it
requires a short escape time of the electrons from the cluster. An episodic
injection of relativistic electrons, presumably from galaxies or AGN, and/or
episodic generation of turbulence and shocks by mergers can result in an
electron spectrum consistent with observations but for only a short period of
less than one billion years.

  Stromgren was unaware of that this plasma, similar to the plasma of a gas

superradiant rays emitted tangentially with the sphere appear resulting from a
discontinuous ring because of the competition of optical modes. The

  The extreme brightness of the rays emitted by the source allows a
multiphotonic non-resonant absorption leading in stationary states or the
ionization continuum. This absorption combines with the superradiant emissions
in a multiphotonic diffusion induced by the superradiant rays. Although its
brightness remains higher than that of the superradiant rays, the source
becomes invisible if it is observed through a small solid angle.
  The lines emitted inside the sphere are all the more weak as they arrive of
an internal area, lower in atoms, and more reddened also by a parametric
transfer of energy towards the thermal radiation catalyzed by excited atomic
hydrogen present in the sphere only.
  The Stromgren sphere appears to help to simply explain the appearance and the
spectrum of supernova 1987A.

nature of the collapse transition of a polymer is influenced by its bending
stiffness $\epsilon_{\rm b}$. In two dimensions, a recent analytical work
demonstrated that the collapse transition of a partially directed lattice
polymer is always first-order as long as $\epsilon_{\rm b}$ is positive
  [H. Zhou {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 158302 (2006)]. Here we
employ Monte Carlo simulation to investigate systematically the effect of
bending stiffness on the static properties of a 2D lattice polymer. The
system's phase-diagram at zero force is obtained. Depending on $\epsilon_{\rm
b}$ and the temperature $T$, the polymer can be in one of three phases:
crystal, disordered globule, or swollen coil. The crystal-globule transition is
discontinuous, the globule-coil transition is continuous. At moderate or high
values of $\epsilon_{\rm b}$ the intermediate globular phase disappears and the
polymer has only a discontinuous crystal-coil transition. When an external
force is applied, the force-induced collapse transition will either be
continuous or discontinuous, depending on whether the polymer is originally in
the globular or the crystal phase at zero force. The simulation results also
demonstrate an interesting scaling behavior of the polymer at the force-induced
globule-coil transition.

second network consists of $m$ randomly distributed, ad hoc secondary users or
cognitive users. The primary users have priority access to the spectrum and do
not need to change their communication protocol in the presence of secondary
users. The secondary users, however, need to adjust their protocol based on
knowledge about the locations of the primary nodes to bring little loss to the
primary network's throughput. By introducing preservation regions around
primary receivers and avoidance regions around primary base stations, we
propose two modified multihop routing protocols for the cognitive users. Base
on percolation theory, we show that when the secondary network is denser than
the primary network, both networks can simultaneously achieve the same
throughput scaling law as a stand-alone network. Furthermore, the primary
network throughput is subject to only a vanishingly fractional loss.
Specifically, for the ad hoc and the infrastructure-supported primary models,
the primary network achieves sum throughputs of order $n^{1/2}$ and
$\max\{n^{1/2},l\}$, respectively. For both primary network models, for any
$\delta>0$, the secondary network can achieve sum throughput of order
$m^{1/2-\delta}$ with an arbitrarily small fraction of outage. Thus, almost all
secondary source-destination pairs can communicate at a rate of order
$m^{-1/2-\delta}$.

They consist of dark matter (~80 %), hot diffuse intracluster plasma (< 20 %)
and a small fraction of stars, dust, and cold gas, mostly locked in galaxies.
In most clusters, scaling relations between their properties testify that the
cluster components are in approximate dynamical equilibrium within the cluster
gravitational potential well. However, spatially inhomogeneous thermal and
non-thermal emission of the intracluster medium (ICM), observed in some
clusters in the X-ray and radio bands, and the kinematic and morphological
segregation of galaxies are a signature of non-gravitational processes, ongoing
cluster merging and interactions. In the current bottom-up scenario for the
formation of cosmic structure, clusters are the most massive nodes of the
filamentary large-scale structure of the cosmic web and form by anisotropic and
episodic accretion of mass. In this model of the universe dominated by cold
dark matter, at the present time most baryons are expected to be in a diffuse
component rather than in stars and galaxies; moreover, ~50 % of this diffuse
component has temperature ~0.01-1 keV and permeates the filamentary
distribution of the dark matter. The temperature of this Warm-Hot Intergalactic
Medium (WHIM) increases with the local density and its search in the outer
regions of clusters and lower density regions has been the quest of much recent
observational effort. Over the last thirty years, an impressive coherent
picture of the formation and evolution of cosmic structures has emerged from
the intense interplay between observations, theory and numerical experiments.
Future efforts will continue to test whether this picture keeps being valid,
needs corrections or suffers dramatic failures in its predictive power.

joint distribution of independent categorical variables. The procedures
introduced rely on model selection and are based on a penalized least-squares
criterion. Their performance is assessed from a nonasymptotic point of view.
Using a special collection of models, a preliminary estimator is built.
According to an existing model selection theorem, it satisfies an oracle-type
inequality. Moreover, thanks to an approximation result demonstrated in this
paper, it is also proved to be adaptive in the minimax sense. In order to
eliminate some irrelevant change-points selected by that first estimator, a
two-stage procedure is proposed, that also enjoys some adaptivity property.
Besides, the first estimator can be computed with a complexity only linear in
the size of the data. A heuristic method allows to implement the second
procedure quite satisfactorily with the same computational complexity.

  affiliation address",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078680",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aims: By performing a detailed radiative transfer analysis, we determine
fractional abundances of circumstellar H2O in the envelopes around six M-type
asymptotic giant branch stars. The models are also used to predict H2O spectral
line emission for the upcoming Herschel/HIFI mission.
  Methods: We use Infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer
spectra to constrain the circumstellar fractional abundance distribution of
ortho-H2O, using a non-local thermal equilibrium, and non-local, radiative
transfer code based on the accelerated lambda iteration formalism. The
mass-loss rates and kinetic temperature structures for the sample stars are
determined through radiative transfer modelling of CO line emission based on
the Monte-Carlo method. The density and temperature profiles of the
circumstellar dust grains are determined through spectral energy distribution
modelling using the publicly available code Dusty.
  Results: The determined ortho-H2O abundances lie between 1e-4 and 1.5e-3
relative to H2, with the exception of WX Psc, which has a much lower estimated
ortho-H2O abundance of only 2e-6, possibly indicating H_2O adsorption onto dust
grains or recent mass-loss-rate modulations. The estimated abundances are
uncertain by, at best, a factor of a few.
  Conclusions: The high water abundance found for the majority of the sources
suggests that either the `normal' chemical processes are very effective in
producing H2O, or else non-local thermal equilibrium atmospheric chemistry,
grain surface reactions, or a release of H_2O (e.g. from icy bodies like Kuiper
belt objects) play a role. We provide predictions for ortho-H2O lines in the
spectral window of Herschel/HIFI.

non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic processes, and is a result of the ability of
these processes to influence the free energy path between the perturbations and
the shear. They turn what would be simple linear-in-time growth due to current
and vortex stretching from shear into exponentially-growing instabilities. Our
results aid in understanding previous work on the behaviour of weakly-ionized

ambipolar diffusion destabilize both positive and negative angular velocity

resulting from Compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation. Direct evidence for the presence of
relativistic electrons in some 50 clusters comes from measurements of extended
radio emission in their central regions. We briefly review the main results
from observations of extended regions of radio emission, and Faraday rotation
measurements of background and cluster radio sources. The main focus of the
review are searches for nonthermal X-ray emission conducted with past and
currently operating satellites, which yielded appreciable evidence for
nonthermal emission components in the spectra of a few clusters. This evidence
is clearly not unequivocal, due to substantial observational and systematic
uncertainties, in addition to virtually complete lack of spatial information.
If indeed the emission has its origin in Compton scattering of relativistic
electrons by the CMB, then the mean magnetic field strength and density of
relativistic electrons in the cluster can be directly determined. Knowledge of
these basic nonthermal quantities is valuable for the detailed description of
processes in intracluster gas and for the origin of magnetic fields.

leads directly to a robust, falsifiable prediction for the correlation between
stellar fraction (fstar) and total system mass (M500) of galaxy groups and
clusters. This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic
physics or cosmological parameters. In particular, if the fstar-M500 relation
is fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict the logarithmic
slope of this relation to be b>-0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the
fstar-M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be
formed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at
least half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint from
evolution models is b>-0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M500=1E15 Msun)
are observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with M500=5E13 Msun
must have fstar<0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate a
much steeper relation, with fstar>0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. If
confirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today's
clusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from the
higher-redshift progenitors of those groups. We perform a careful analysis of
these and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties in
their measurements. Although correlated uncertainties on stellar and total
masses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistent
with theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.

environment in a quantum dot can be substantially increased by subjecting the
electron to suitable dynamical decoupling sequences. We analyze the performance
of high-level decoupling protocols by using a combination of analytical and
exact numerical methods, and by paying special attention to the regimes of
large inter-pulse delays and long-time dynamics, which are outside the reach of
standard average Hamiltonian theory descriptions. We demonstrate that dynamical
decoupling can remain efficient far beyond its formal domain of applicability,
and find that a protocol exploiting concatenated design provides best
performance for this system in the relevant parameter range. In situations
where the initial electron state is known, protocols able to completely freeze
decoherence at long times are constructed and characterized. The impact of
system and control non-idealities is also assessed, including the effect of
intra-bath dipolar interaction, magnetic field bias and bath polarization, as
well as systematic pulse imperfections. While small bias field and small bath
polarization degrade the decoupling fidelity, enhanced performance and temporal
modulation result from strong applied fields and high polarizations. Overall,
we find that if the relative errors of the control parameters do not exceed 5%,
decoupling protocols can still prolong the coherence time by up to two orders

Being the main gas-heating agent, cosmological shocks could amplify magnetic
fields and accelerate energetic particles via the multi-fluid plasma relaxation
processes. We first discuss the basic properties of standard single-fluid
shocks. Cosmological plasma shocks are expected to be collisionless. We then
review the plasma processes responsible for the microscopic structure of
collisionless shocks. A tiny fraction of the particles crossing the shock is
injected into the non-thermal energetic component that could get a substantial
part of the ram pressure power dissipated at the shock. The energetic particles
penetrate deep into the shock upstream producing an extended shock precursor.
Scaling relations for postshock ion temperature and entropy as functions of
shock velocity in strong collisionless multi-fluid shocks are discussed. We
show that the multi-fluid nature of collisionless shocks results in excessive
gas compression, energetic particle acceleration, precursor gas heating,
magnetic field amplification and non-thermal emission. Multi-fluid shocks
provide a reduced gas entropy production and could also modify the observable
thermodynamic scaling relations for clusters of galaxies.

neglecting the important fact that the thermal mounts which are placed
underneath the chip can be significantly larger than the chip itself. In an

cold in the model, which is highly significant compared to random sampling and
corroborates well documented trends in North Atlantic TC number in recent

significant increase in model landfall rates in hot years, uniform along the

  degrees of disorder","10 pages, 9 Figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.104503",,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  The dependence of the Josephson Plasma Resonance (JPR) frequency in heavily
underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\delta on temperature and controlled pointlike
disorder, introduced by high-energy electron irradiation, is cross-correlated
and compared to the behavior of the ab-plane penetration depth. It is found
that the zero temperature plasma frequency, representative of the superfluid
component of the c-axis spectral weight, decreases proportionally with T_c when
the disorder is increased. The temperature dependence of the JPR frequency is
the same for all disorder levels, including pristine crystals. The reduction of
the c-axis superfluid density as function of disorder is accounted for by
pair-breaking induced by impurity scattering in the CuO2 planes, rather than by
quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase. The reduction of the c-axis
superfluid density as function of temperature follows a T^{2}--law and is
accounted for by quasi-particle hopping through impurity induced interlayer
states.

non-thermal emission in clusters of galaxies, with a primary focus on the radio
and hard X-ray emission. We show that the difficulty with the non-thermal,
non-relativistic Bremsstrahlung model for the hard X-ray emission, first
pointed out by Petrosian (2001) using a cold target approximation, is somewhat
alleviated when one treats the problem more exactly by including the fact that
the background plasma particle energies are on average a factor of 10 below the
energy of the non-thermal particles. This increases the lifetime of the
non-thermal particles, and as a result decreases the extreme energy
requirement, but at most by a factor of three. We then review the synchrotron
and so-called inverse Compton emission by relativistic electrons, which when
compared with observations can constrain the value of the magnetic field and
energy of relativistic electrons. This model requires a low value of the
magnetic field which is far from the equipartition value. We briefly review the
possibilities of gamma-ray emission and prospects for GLAST observations. We
also present a toy model of the non-thermal electron spectra that are produced
by the acceleration mechanisms discussed in an accompanying paper.

hydrodynamics in conservative form in three-dimensional axi-symmetry is
presented. This algorithm is a direct extension of the pseudo-Newtonian
implicit radiative magnetohydrodynamical solver -IRMHD- into the general
relativistic regime.
  We adopt the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and formulate the hydrodynamical
equations in the fixed background of a Kerr black hole. The set of equations
are solved implicitly using the hierarchical solution scenario (HSS). The HSS
is efficient, robust and enables the use of a variety of solution procedures
that range from a purely explicit up to fully implicit schemes. The
discretization of the HD-equations is based on the finite volume formulation
and the defect-correction iteration strategy for recovering higher order
spatial and temporal accuracies. Depending on the astrophysical problem, a
variety of relaxation methods can be applied. In particular the vectorized
black-white Line-Gauss-Seidel relaxation method is most suitable for modeling
accretion flows with shocks, whereas the Approximate Factorization Method is
for weakly compressible flows.
  The results of several test calculations that verify the accuracy and
robustness of the algorithm are shown. Extending the algorithm to enable
solving the non-ideal MHD equations in the general relativistic regime is the
subject of our ongoing research.

Writing the criterion for convection in rotating envelopes, we show that the

sign to the effect of the Solberg-Hoiland criterion. On the whole, rotation
favors convection in stellar envelopes at the equator and to a smaller extent
at the poles. In a rotating 20 Msun star at 94% of the critical angular
velocity, there are two convective envelopes, with the bigger one having a
thickness of 13.2% of the equatorial radius. In the non-rotating model, the
corresponding convective zone has a thickness of only 4.6% of the radius. The
occurrence of outer convection in massive stars has many consequences.

  spin-transfer effect","20 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.174408",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  A mesoscopic description of spin-transfer effect is proposed, based on the
spin-injection mechanism occurring at the junction with a ferromagnet. The
effect of spin-injection is to modify locally, in the ferromagnetic
configuration space, the density of magnetic moments. The corresponding
gradient leads to a current-dependent diffusion process of the magnetization.
In order to describe this effect, the dynamics of the magnetization of a
ferromagnetic single domain is reconsidered in the framework of the
thermokinetic theory of mesoscopic systems. Assuming an Onsager
cross-coefficient that couples the currents, it is shown that spin-dependent
electric transport leads to a correction of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation of the ferromagnetic order parameter with supplementary diffusion
terms. The consequence of spin-injection in terms of activation process of the
ferromagnet is deduced, and the expressions of the effective energy barrier and
of the critical current are derived. Magnetic fluctuations are calculated: the
correction to the fluctuations is similar to that predicted for the activation.
These predictions are consistent with the measurements of spin-transfer
obtained in the activation regime and for ferromagnetic resonance under
spin-injection.

ZnO:Co is at present rather elusive. Although standard secondary phases can
usually be ruled out, it is less clear whether regions with high Co
concentration coexist with undoped portions of the film, i.e. whether some form
of CoO polymorph can be responsible for the magnetic signal. Since X-ray
usually excludes the presence of the native rock-salt phase, the study of CoO
polymorphs becomes particularly interesting. In this work we investigate
theoretically the magnetism of CoO in both the wurtzite and zincblende phases.
By using a combination of density functional theory with the LDA+$U$
approximation and Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that wurtzite and
zincblende CoO have a complex frustrated anti-ferromagnetic ground state with
no net magnetic moment in the bulk. Most importantly the estimated critical
temperatures are well below room temperature for both cases. This suggests that
bulk CoO polymorphs are not responsible for the room temperature magnetism
observed for ZnO:Co, although the role of clusters with uncompensated spins or
arranged in a spinodal decomposed structure still remains an open question.

properties of solid Ne at densities near the equilibrium by estimating the
radial pair-distribution function, Lindemann's ratio and atomic density profile
around the positions of the perfect crystalline lattice. Our value for $E_{k}$
at the equilibrium density is $41.51(6)$ K, which agrees perfectly with the
recent prediction made by Timms {\it et al.}, $41(2)$ K, based on their
deep-inelastic neutron scattering experiments carried out over the temperature
range $4 - 20$ K, and also with previous path integral Monte Carlo results
obtained with the Lennard-Jones and Aziz HFD-C2 atomic pairwise interactions.
The one-body density function of solid Ne is calculated accurately and found to
fit perfectly, within statistical uncertainty, to a Gaussian curve.
Furthermore, we analyze the degree of anharmonicity of solid Ne by calculating
some of its microscopic ground-state properties within traditional harmonic
approaches. We provide insightful comparison to solid $^4$He in terms of the
