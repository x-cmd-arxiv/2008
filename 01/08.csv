the evolution of the X-ray properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) during
the cosmological history of the hierarchical build up of galaxy clusters. In
this paper we review the current status of these simulations and how their
predictions fare in reproducing the most recent X-ray observations of clusters.
After briefly discussing the shortcomings of the self-similar model, based on
assuming that gravity only drives the evolution of the ICM, we discuss how the
processes of gas cooling and non-gravitational heating are expected to bring
model predictions into better agreement with observational data. We then
present results from the hydrodynamical simulations, performed by different
groups, and how they compare with observational data. As terms of comparison,
we use X-ray scaling relations between mass, luminosity, temperature and
pressure, as well as the profiles of temperature and entropy. The results of
this comparison can be summarised as follows: (a) simulations, which include
gas cooling, star formation and supernova feedback, are generally successful in
reproducing the X-ray properties of the ICM outside the core regions; (b)
simulations generally fail in reproducing the observed ``cool core'' structure,
in that they have serious difficulties in regulating overcooling, thereby
producing steep negative central temperature profiles. This discrepancy calls
for the need of introducing other physical processes, such as energy feedback
from active galactic nuclei, which should compensate the radiative losses of
the gas with high density, low entropy and short cooling time, which is
observed to reside in the innermost regions of galaxy clusters.

are extracted from polynomial fit curves evaluated at different module
temperatures (hot side, cold side, average, and mean module temperature). For
the case of distributed parameter models, material properties are calculated
according to the mean temperature at each segment of a sectioned device. A
couple of important advantages of the presented models are that temperature
dependence of material properties is considered and that they can be easily
simulated using an electronic simulation tool such as SPICE. Comparisons are
made between SPICE simulations for a single-pellet module using the proposed
models and with numerical simulations carried out with Mathematica software.
Results illustrate accuracy of the distributed parameter models and show how
inappropriate is to assume, in some cases, constant material parameters for an
entire thermoelectric element.

air-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was
selected for this study measuring approximately 300x300x400 mm (WxLxH). Solar
radiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced

This was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting

reduce the impact of solar loads. Adding internal circulation fans can also be
very effective. Using air-to-air heat exchangers was found to be the most

continued from the normal modes of the corresponding linearized system. They
are localized in the space of normal modes. The existence of these solutions in
a weakly anharmonic atomic chain explained essential features of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) paradox. We study $q$-breathers in one- two- and
three-dimensional discrete nonlinear Sch\""{o}dinger (DNLS) lattices --
theoretical playgrounds for light propagation in nonlinear optical waveguide
networks, and the dynamics of cold atoms in optical lattices. We prove the
existence of these solutions for weak nonlinearity. We find that the
localization of $q$-breathers is controlled by a single parameter which depends
on the norm density, nonlinearity strength and seed wave vector. At a critical
value of that parameter $q$-breathers delocalize via resonances, signaling a
breakdown of the normal mode picture and a transition into strong mode-mode
interaction regime. In particular this breakdown takes place at one of the
edges of the normal mode spectrum, and in a singular way also in the center of
that spectrum. A stability analysis of $q$-breathers supplements these
findings. For three-dimensional lattices, we find $q$-breather vortices, which
violate time reversal symmetry and generate a vortex ring flow of energy in

challenge in automatically mining product opinions from the web and in
generating opinion-based summaries of user reviews. Our models are based on
extensions to standard topic modeling methods such as LDA and PLSA to induce
multi-grain topics. We argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for
our task since standard models tend to produce topics that correspond to global
properties of objects (e.g., the brand of a product type) rather than the
aspects of an object that tend to be rated by a user. The models we present not
only extract ratable aspects, but also cluster them into coherent topics, e.g.,
`waitress' and `bartender' are part of the same topic `staff' for restaurants.
This differentiates it from much of the previous work which extracts aspects
through term frequency analysis with minimal clustering. We evaluate the
multi-grain models both qualitatively and quantitatively to show that they
improve significantly upon standard topic models.

X-ray halo, which has been taken as evidence of residual hot gas as predicted

should undergo thermal instabilities, leading to a population of warm clouds
falling onto the disk. If so, then one might expect to find a vertically
extended neutral layer. We detect a substantial high-latitude component, but
conclude that almost all of its mass of 1.2-1.6 billion solar masses most
likely resides in a warp. Four features far from the plane containing about 100
million solar masses are found at velocities distinct from this warp. These
clouds may be associated with the expected infall, although an origin in a
disk-halo flow cannot be ruled out, except for one feature which is
counter-rotating. The warp itself may be a result of infall according to recent
models. But clearly this galaxy lacks a massive, lagging neutral halo as found
in NGC 891. The disk HI is concentrated into two rings of radii 1.5 and 3
arcminutes. Radial inflow is found in the disk, probably due to the bar in this
galaxy. A nearby member of this galaxy group, NGC 5740, is also detected. It
shows a prominent one-sided extension which may be the result of ram pressure
stripping.

shows a density profile more concentrated than that of the progenitors, with a
central density higher than the sum of the central progenitors central
densities. These findings support the idea that a massive Nuclear Cluster may
have formed in early phases of the mother galaxy evolution and lead to the
formation of a nucleus, which, in many galaxies, has indeed a luminosity
profile similar to that of an extended King model. A correlation with galactic

axisymmetric, HD simulations for variety of the adiabatic index, $\gamma$ and
the gas temperature at infinity, $c_\infty$. Our work is an extension of work
done by Proga & Begelman who consider models for only $\gamma=5/3$. Our main
result is that the flow properties such as the topology of the sonic surface
and time behavior strongly depend on $\gamma$ but little on $c_\infty$. In
particular, for $1 < \gamma < 5/3$, the mass accretion rate shows large
amplitude, slow time-variability which is a result of mixing between slow and
fast rotating gas. This temporal behavior differs significantly from that in
models with $\gamma\simless 5/3$ where the accretion rate is relatively
constant and from that in models with $\gamma\simgreat 1$ where the accretion
exhibits small amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations. The key parameter
responsible for the differences is the sound speed of the accretion flow which
in turn determines whether the flow is dominated by gas pressure, radiation
pressure or rotation. Despite these differences the time-averaged mass
accretion rate in units of the corresponding Bondi rate is a weak function of
$\gamma$ and $c_\infty$.

stellar evolution theory. Whilst a variety of techniques have been used to
infer the basic properties of these simple populations, systematic
uncertainties arise from the purely geometrical degeneracy produced by the
similar shape of isochrones of different ages and metallicities. Here we
present an objective and robust statistical technique which lifts this
degeneracy to a great extent through the use of a key observable: the number of
stars along the isochrone. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show
that, for instance, we can infer the four main parameters (age, metallicity,
distance and reddening) in an objective way, along with robust confidence
intervals and their full covariance matrix. We show that systematic
uncertainties due to field contamination, unresolved binaries, initial or
present-day stellar mass function are either negligible or well under control.
This technique provides, for the first time, a proper way to infer with
unprecedented accuracy the fundamental properties of simple stellar
populations, in an easy-to-implement algorithm.

period of this system was found to be 0.270881(3) days. The secondary star is
clearly visible in the spectra through absorption lines of the neutral metals
MgI, FeI and CaI. Its spectral type was found to be K3+-0.5. A radial velocity
study of the secondary yielded a semi-amplitude of K_2=182.5+-0.9 km/s. The
radial velocity semiamplitude of the white dwarf was found to be K_1=74+-3 km/s
from the motion of the wings of the Halpha and Hbeta emission lines. From these
parameters we have obtained that the secondary in BF Eri is an evolved star
with a mass of 0.50-0.59 Msun, whose size is about 30 per cent larger than a
zero-age main-sequence single-star of the same mass. We also show that BF Eri
contains a massive white dwarf (M1>1.23 Msun), allowing us to consider the
system as a SN Ia progenitor. BF Eri also shows a high gamma-velocity
(gamma=-94 km/s) and substantial proper motion. With our estimation of the
distance to the system (d~700+-200 pc), this corresponds to a space velocity of
~350 km/s with respect to the dynamical local standard of rest. The cumulative
effect of repeated nova eruptions with asymmetric envelope ejection might
explain the high space velocity of the system. We analyze the outburst

two-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a
retrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary
systems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,
and formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To
characterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we
apply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator
(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine
structure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving
configurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia
genetic algorithm. A statistical study of the stability in the neighborhood of
different observed, planetary-systems is completed using a Monte-Carlo method.
We analyse the observational data for the HD73526 planetary system and find
that counter-revolving configurations may be consistent with the observational
data. We highlight the fine and characteristic structure of retrograde MMRs. We
demonstrate that retrograde resonances open a family of stabilizing mechanisms
involving new apsidal precession behaviors. Considering two possible formation
mechanisms (free-floating planet and Slingshot model), we conclude that
counter-revolving configurations are feasible.

of massive stars. Some CC-SNe are linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) and are highly aspherical. One important question is to what extent
asphericity is common to all CC-SNe. Here we present late-time spectra for a
number of CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars, and use them to explore any
asphericity generated in the inner part of the exploding star, near the site of
collapse. A range of oxygen emission-line profiles is observed, including a
high incidence of double-peaked profiles, a distinct signature of an aspherical
explosion. Our results suggest that all CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars are
aspherical explosions and that SNe accompanied by GRBs exhibit the highest
degree of asphericity.

process that grows it toward a Chandrasekhar mass. It is therefore expected to
be quickly rotating when it ignites as a Type Ia supernova. The thermal and
shearing profile are important for subsequent flame propagation. We highlight
processes that could affect the WD shear, during accretion as well as during
the ~1000 years of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the
shear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD
very close to solid body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant
shear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical
Chandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the
WD's center. This phase occurs regardless of progenitor scenario, and therefore
it is of great interest for understanding how the WD interior is prepared
before the explosive burning begins. We summarize some of the key properties of
the convective region, which includes demonstrating that the mass enclosed by
convection at any given time depends most sensitively on a single parameter
that can be expressed as either the ratio of temperatures or densities at the
top and bottom of the convection zone. At low Rossby numbers the redistribution
of angular momentum by convection may result in significant shearing at the

not have any emission lines indicative of ongoing star formation in their

preferentially exist in infall regions of galaxy clusters, suggesting that the
cluster environment is likely to be responsible for creating these galaxies. By
carrying out spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy on four nearby passive
spiral galaxies with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope, we
investigated the stellar populations of passive spiral galaxies separately for
their inner and outer regions. In the two unambiguously passive spiral galaxies
among the four observed galaxies, H$\delta$ absorption lines are more prominent
in the outer regions of the galaxies, whereas the 4000-{\AA} breaks
(D$_{4000}$) are strongest in the inner regions of the galaxies. A comparison
with a simple stellar population model for the two passive spiral galaxies
indicates that the outer regions of the galaxies tend to harbour younger
populations of stars. The strong H$\delta$ absorption observed in the outer
regions of the sample galaxies is consistent with that of galaxies whose star
formation ceased a few Gyrs ago. Because of the large uncertainty in the
absorption indices in our samples, further observations are needed in order to
place constraints on the mechanisms that quench star formation in passive

continuum redshifts are driven by the Balmer/4000 Angstrom break, and have an
uncertainty in dz/(1+z) of <0.019. We use this unique sample to determine, for
the first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massive
high-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.
We find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have a
systematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). The systematic
error can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the random
error, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. The spectra lead to
significantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. For most
quantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectral
resolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. Properties such as the
age, A_V, current star formation rate, and the star formation history are
generally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. Interestingly
stellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parameters
from broadband data. Nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate the
number of massive galaxies at 2<z<3, and thus underestimate the evolution of
the stellar mass density. Finally,the spectroscopy supports our previous
finding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy population

approximated by the alpha-enhanced Dartmouth isochrones. Placing our relative

2 - 3 Gyr than the ages of the oldest Galactic globular clusters of comparable

cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, NGC121, is a few Gyr younger than its
oldest counterparts in the Milky Way and in other nearby dwarf galaxies such as
the Large Magellanic Cloud, Fornax, and Sagittarius. If it were accreted into

it is not as young as the youngest globular clusters associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf. The young age of NGC121 could result from delayed cluster
formation in the Small Magellanic Cloud or result from the random survival of

subsolar-mass stars are primordial disks. At the 1--2 sigma level, more massive
stars also have a smaller frequency of gas accretion and smaller mid-IR
luminosities than lower-mass stars. These trends are suggestive of a stellar
mass-dependent evolution of disks, where most disks around
high/intermediate-mass stars shed their primordial disks on rapid, 2.5 Myr

which has been computed previously and in QCD is relevant to quarkonium physics

the origin of the anomolous abundances. We aim at detecting (i.) a group of
`parent' molecules (CO, SiO, HCN, CS), predicted by the non-equilibrium study
of Cherchneff (2006) to form with almost constant abundances independent of the

JCMT and APEX in four AGB stars: the oxygen-rich Mira WX Psc, the S star W Aql,
and the two carbon stars V Cyg and II Lup. A critical density analysis is
performed to determine the formation region of the high-excitation molecular

  (minor changes made to the previous version)","Astrophys.J.679:990-999,2008","10.1086/587870",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal magnetic field and
an ultrarelativistic equation of state, with the goal of studying the lateral
structure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the medium
through which they propagate. We find all self-similar steady-state solutions
of the relativistic MHD equations for this setup. One of the solutions is the
case of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it
propagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z)\propto z^{-2}. As
the jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the
ambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while
the magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet.
Such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle
\theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\gamma, where \gamma is the
characteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts
of the jet cannot maintain causal contact. We construct maps of optically thin
synchrotron emission from our self-similar models. We suggest that the boundary
pile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of
M87. We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from
the jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3C273
and Mkn501. Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a
strong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the
polarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather
uncertain. For example, jets with toroidal magnetic fields display the
`spine-sheath' polarization angle pattern seen in some BL Lac objects.

establish exponential decay in $L^{\infty}$ norm for hard potentials for
general classes of smooth domains near an absolute Maxwellian. Moreover, in

targeted to modeling and understanding the origin of the X-ray luminosity

explore the population XLF down to luminosities of 3X10^36 erg/s, as probed by
the most recent observational results (Kim et al., 2006). We consider models

near-infrared (K'-band) images to study the LIRG morphologies and spatially
resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Two thirds of the LIRGs are disk
galaxies, with only one third showing some evidence for interactions, minor, or
major mergers. In contrast with local LIRG disks (which are primarily barred
systems), only 10% of the LIRG disks in our sample contain a prominent bar.
While the optical bands tend to show significant point-like substructure,
indicating distributed star formation, the AO K-band images tend to be smooth.
The SEDs of the LIRGs are consistent with distributed dusty star formation, as
exhibited by optical to IR colors redder than allowed by old stellar
populations alone. This effect is most pronounced in the galaxy cores, possibly
indicating central star formation. We also observed a set of 11 intermediate
redshift comparison galaxies, selected to be non-ellipticals with apparent
K-band magnitudes comparable to the LIRGs. The ""normal"" (non-LIRG) systems
tended to have lower optical luminosity, lower stellar mass, and more irregular
morphology than the LIRGs. Half of the ""normal"" galaxies have SEDs consistent
with intermediate aged stellar populations and minimal dust. The other half
show evidence for some dusty star formation, usually concentrated in their
cores. Our work suggests that the LIRG disk galaxies are similar to large disk
systems today, undergoing self regulated star formation, only at 10 - 20 times
higher rates. (Abridged)

of only +/-0.4 mas/yr on each component of the proper motion. We find mu_alpha
= -11.7+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr and mu_delta = +4.2+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr relative to
the pulsar's standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from the
measurement and the ncertainties in correcting the proper motion reference

+/-2 mas/yr to each component of the proper motion, although this could be
significantly larger. This implies a projected misalignment with the nebular

and non-thermal emission mechanisms in the pulsar magnetospheres.
  We solve distribution of the accelerating electric field with the emission
process and the pair-creation process in meridional plane, which includes the
rotational axis and the magnetic axis. By solving the evolutions of the Lorentz
factor, and of the pitch angle, we calculate spectrum in optical through
$\gamma$-ray bands with the curvature radiation, synchrotron radiation, and
inverse-Compton process not only for outgoing particles, but also for ingoing
particles, which were ignored in previous studies. We apply the theory to the
Vela pulsar. We find that the curvature radiation from the outgoing particles
is the major emission process above 10 MeV bands. In soft $\gamma$-ray to hard
X-ray bands, the synchrotron radiation from the ingoing primary particles in
the gap dominates in the spectrum. Below hard X-ray bands, the synchrotron
emissions from both outgoing and ingoing particles contribute to the calculated
spectrum. The calculated spectrum is consistent with the observed
phase-averaged spectrum of the Vela pulsar. We show that the observed five-peak
pulse profile in the X-ray bands of the Vela pulsar is reproduced by the inward
and outward emissions, and the observed double-peak pulse profile in
$\gamma$-ray bands is explained by the outward emissions.

  of Logarithms of Intensity","12 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1086/591238",,"astro-ph",,"  We continue our work on developing techniques for studying turbulence with
spectroscopic data. We show that Doppler-broadened absorption spectral lines,
in particularly, saturated absorption lines, can be used within the framework
of the earlier-introduced technique termed the Velocity Coordinate spectrum
(VCS). The VCS relates the statistics of fluctuations along the velocity
coordinate to the statistics of turbulence, thus it does not require spatial
coverage by sampling directions in the plane of the sky. We consider lines with
different degree of absorption and show that for lines of optical depth less
than one, our earlier treatment of the VCS developed for spectral emission
lines is applicable, if the optical depth is used instead of intensity. This
amounts to correlating the logarithms of absorbed intensities. For larger
optical depths and saturated absorption lines, we show, that the amount of
information that one can use is, inevitably, limited by noise. In practical
terms, this means that only wings of the line are available for the analysis.
In terms of the VCS formalism, this results in introducing an additional
window, which size decreases with the increase of the optical depth. As a
result, strongly saturated absorption lines carry the information only about
the small scale turbulence. Nevertheless, the contrast of the fluctuations
corresponding to the small scale turbulence increases with the increase of the
optical depth, which provides advantages for studying turbulence combining
lines with different optical depths. Combining different absorption lines one
can tomography turbulence in the interstellar gas in all its complexity.

6.0 and 6.85 um bands are detected toward all sources, with the Class 0-type
YSOs showing the deepest bands ever observed. In almost all sources the 6.0 um
band is deeper than expected from the bending mode of pure solid H2O. The depth
and shape variations of the remaining 5-7 um absorption indicate that it
consists of 5 independent components, which, by comparison to laboratory
studies, must be from at least 8 different carriers. Simple species are
responsible for much of the absorption in the 5-7 um region, at abundances of
1-30% for CH3OH, 3-8% for NH3, 1-5% for HCOOH, ~6% for H2CO, and ~0.3% for
HCOO- with respect to solid H2O. The 6.85 um band likely consists of one or two
carriers, of which one is less volatile than H2O because its abundance relative
to H2O is enhanced at lower H2O/tau_9.7 ratios. It does not survive in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), however. The similarity of the 6.85 um bands
for YSOs and background stars indicates that its carrier(s) must be formed
early in the molecular cloud evolution. If an NH4+ salt is the carrier its
abundance with respect to solid H2O is typically 7%, and low temperature
acid-base chemistry or cosmic ray induced reactions must have been involved in
its formation. Possible origins are discussed for the carrier of an enigmatic,
very broad absorption between 5 and 8 um. Finally, all the phenomena observed
for ices toward massive YSOs are also observed toward low mass YSOs, indicating
that processing of the ices by internal ultraviolet radiation fields is a minor
factor in the early chemical evolution of the ices. [abridged]

correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can
be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in

vector current in the soft wall model by using the AdS/CFT dictionary. The
resulting correlator is exactly the same as the one previously obtained from
dispersion relation with the same spectral function as in this model. The
coefficient $C_2$ of the two-dimensional power correction is found to be
$C_2=-c/2$ with $c$ the slope of the Regge trajectory, rather than $C_2=-c/3$
derived from the strategy of first quantized string theory. Taking the slope of
the $\rho$ trajectory $c\approx0.9{GeV}^2$ as input, we then get
$C_2\approx-0.45{GeV}^2$. The gluon condensate is found to be
$<\alpha_sG^2>\approx0.064{GeV}^4$, which is almost identical to the QCD sum
rule estimation. By comparing these two equivalent derivation of the correlator
of scalar glueball operator, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional correction
can't be eliminated by including the non-leading solution in the
bulk-to-boundary propagator, as was done in \cite{Colangelo2}. In other words,
the two-dimensional correction does exist in the scalar glueball case. Also it
is manifest by using the dispersion relation that the minus sign of gluon
condensate and violation of the low energy theorem are related to the
subtraction scheme.

to form planar zigzag and dimerized zigzag geometry. Dimerization in both
infinite and finite chains are much stronger than the usual Peierls distortion
and appear to depend on the number of 3d-electrons. As a result of
dimerization, a significant energy lowering occurs which, in turn, influences
the stability and physical properties. Metallic linear chain of Vanadium
becomes half-metallic upon dimerization. Infinite linear chain of Scandium also
becomes half-metallic upon transformation to zigzag structure. An interplay
between the magnetic ground state and atomic as well as electronic structure of
the chain has been revealed. The end effects influence the geometry, energetics

performed using noncollinear approximation indicates significant differences
from the collinear approximation. Variation of the cohesive energy of infinite

mimic the bulk behavior pointed out by Friedel. The spin-orbit coupling of

properties indicate very weak or absent star formation, moderately old stellar
ages of ~1 Gyr (for solar metallicity) and stellar masses in the range of
10^{10-11} solar masses, thus implying that the major star formation and
assembly processes for these galaxies occurred at z>2. These galaxies have
morphologies that are predominantly compact and spheroidal.However, their sizes
(R_e <~ 1 kpc) are much smaller than those of spheroids in the present--day
Universe. Their stellar mass surface densities are consequently higher by ~1
dex if compared to spheroids at z~0 with the same mass. Their rest-frame B-band
surface brightness scales with the effective radius, but the offset with
respect to the surface brightness of the local Kormendy relation is too large
to be explained by simple passive evolution. At z~1, a larger fraction of
passive galaxies follows the z~0 size -- mass relation. Superdense relics with
R_e~1 kpc are extremely rare at z~0 with respect to z>1, and absent if R_e<1
kpc. Because of the similar sizes and mass densities, we suggest that the
superdense passive galaxies at 1<z<2 are the remnants of the powerful
starbursts occurring in submillimeter--selected galaxies at z>2. The results
are compared with theoretical models and the main implications discussed in the
framework of massive galaxy formation and evolution.

the optimality of a discrete input distribution in this scenario. Specifically,
we show that for any given output quantizer choice with K quantization bins
(i.e., a precision of log2 K bits), the input distribution, under an average
power constraint, need not have any more than K + 1 mass points to achieve the
channel capacity. The cutting-plane algorithm is employed to compute this
capacity and to generate optimum input distributions. Numerical optimization
over the choice of the quantizer is then performed (for 2-bit and 3-bit
symmetric quantization), and the results we obtain show that the loss due to
low-precision output quantization, which is small at low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) as expected, can be quite acceptable even for moderate to high SNR
values. For example, at SNRs up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization achieves 80-90%
of the capacity achievable using infinite-precision quantization.

naturally from the observed amount of dust and the relatively high HI column
density. Radiation transfer effects and suppresion by dust transform a strong
intrinsic Lya emission with EW(Lya)>~ 60 Ang into the observed faint superposed

transition from being gas-rich and star-forming to gas-poor and

become after their young stellar populations fade away, we present the detailed
morphologies of 21 E+As using HST images. We find that E+As are similar to
early types in that they have large bulge fractions (median B/T = 0.59), high
Sersic index (n > 4), and high concentration indices (C > 4.3). The large
fraction (70%) of E+As with positive color gradients (i.e., bluer nuclei)
indicates that the young stellar populations are more concentrated than the old
populations. We show that these positive color gradients can evolve into the
negative gradients typical in E/S0s if the central parts of these galaxies are
metal enhanced. E+A galaxies stand apart from the E/S0s in the edge-on
projection of the Fundamental Plane, implying that E+As have, on average, a M/L
that is ~3.8 times smaller than that of E/S0s. The tilt of the E+A FP indicates
that the variation among stellar populations in these galaxies is closely tied
to their structural parameters such that smaller or less massive galaxies have
smaller M/L. We find a population of unresolved compact sources in nine E+As
(45%). Their colors and luminosities are consistent with the hypothesis that
these are newly formed star clusters. The bright end of the cluster LF is
fainter in redder E+A's, suggesting that the young star cluster systems have
faded or been disrupted as the merger remnant aged. In summary, the
morphologies, color profiles, scaling relations, and cluster populations are
all consistent with the hypothesis that E+As galaxies are the results of
mergers that evolve into early-type galaxies.

point, but seems to be connected to the presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations.
These conclusions not only provide a basic concept to understand the ESR in
Kondo lattice systems even well below the Kondo temperature as observed in the
heavy fermion metal YbRh2Si2 but point out ESR as a prime method to investigate
directly the spin dynamics of the Kondo ion.

oxygen abundances of the interstellar medium using the R23 and N2 methods.
Galaxy stellar metallicities provide crucial data for chemical evolution models
but have not been assessed reliably much outside the local Universe. Aims: We
determine the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) at redshift z~2, observed as part of the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep
Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS). Methods: We compute the equivalent width of a
rest-frame mid-ultraviolet, photospheric absorption-line index, the 1978 index
found to vary monotonically with stellar metallicity by Rix and collaborators.
We normalise and combine 75 SFG spectra from the GMASS survey to produce a
spectrum corresponding to a total integration time 1652.5 hours (and a
signal-to-noise ratio ~100 for our 1.5 angstrom binning) of FORS2 spectroscopic
observations at the Very Large Telescope. Results: We measure an
iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of log (Z/Zsolar) = -0.574+/-0.159 for our
spectrum representative of a galaxy of stellar mass 9.4 x 10^9 Msolar assuming
a Chabrier IMF. We find that the R04 model SFG spectrum for log (Z/Zsolar) =
-0.699 solar metallicity provides the best description of our GMASS coadded
spectrum. For similar galaxy stellar mass, our stellar metallicity is ~0.25 dex
lower than the oxygen-abundance, gas-phase metallicity quantified by Erb and
collaborators for UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z=2. Conclusions: We
conclude that we are witnessing the establishment of a light-element
overabundance in galaxies as they are being formed at redshift z~2. Our
measurements are reminiscent of the alpha-element enhancement seen in
low-redshift, galactic bulges and early-type galaxies. (Abridged)

embedding if and only if all its fibers are discrete and it induces a
bimeromorphic map on its image. We prove more generally the ""Generalized
Zariski Main Theorem for analytic spaces"", which claims that an holomorphic map
from an irreducible analytic space to a irreducible locally irreducible one is
an open embedding if and only if it is flat and induces a bimeromorphic map on
its image. Thanks to the ""analytic criterion of regularity"" of Serre-Samuel in
GAGA [12] and to ""Lefschetz Principle"", we finally deduce the ""Generalized
Zariski Main Theorem for algebraic varieties of characteristical zero"", which
claims that a morphism from such an irreducible variety to an irreducible
unibranch one is an open immersion if and only if it is birational and flat.

CH4 toward low mass star forming regions as well. Infrared spectra from the
Spitzer Space Telescope are presented to determine the solid CH4 abundance
toward a large sample of low mass young stellar objects. 25 out of 52 ice
sources in the $c2d$ (cores to disks) legacy have an absorption feature at 7.7
um, attributed to the bending mode of solid CH4. The solid CH4 / H2O abundances
are 2-8%, except for three sources with abundances as high as 11-13%. These
latter sources have relatively large uncertainties due to small total ice
column densities. Toward sources with H2O column densities above 2E18 cm-2, the
CH4 abundances (20 out of 25) are nearly constant at 4.7+/-1.6%. Correlation
plots with solid H2O, CH3OH, CO2 and CO column densities and abundances
relative to H2O reveal a closer relationship of solid CH4 with CO2 and H2O than
with solid CO and CH3OH. The inferred solid CH4 abundances are consistent with
models where CH4 is formed through sequential hydrogenation of C on grain
surfaces. Finally the equal or higher abundances toward low mass young stellar
objects compared with high mass objects and the correlation studies support
this formation pathway as well, but not the two competing theories: formation
from CH3OH and formation in gas phase with subsequent freeze-out.

possible high energy cosmic rays populated in the region with harder spectrum

speculation in detail. We find that, a diffuse proton source with power index

$\alpha_e\lesssim2.6$ can reproduce the Milagro's observation without
conflicting with the EGRET data. Further detections on neutrinos, a diagnostic
of the hadronic model, and hard X-ray synchrontron radiation, a diagnostic of

based on a set of halo stars from SDSS as kinematic tracers. Our sample
comprises 2401 rigorously selected Blue Horizontal-Branch (BHB) halo stars
drawn from SDSS DR-6. To interpret these distributions, we compare them to
matched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy
formation simulations designed to resemble the Milky Way, which we presume to
have an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. We then determine which
value of $\rm V_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement with
the corresponding distributions from the simulations. This procedure results in
an estimate of the Milky Way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, which
is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$
at the Sun's location, and implies M$(<60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times
10^{11}$M$_\odot$. The radial dependence of $\rm V_{cir}(r)$, derived in
statistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations
from an NFW dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components at
its center. If we assume an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration
holds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the Milky
Way's dark matter halo, M$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times
10^{12}$M$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. This estimate
implies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the Milky
Way's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our Galaxy. A value
for M$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ also (re-)opens the
question of whether all of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies are on bound
orbits.

sigma_L/sigma_tot = 24.9 +/- 4.5(stat) +/- 2.2(syst) % at a mean energy of 198

outburst to be as strong as the big outbursts of the past: starting from late
September 2006, a brightness increase of 5 mag led to the outburst peak in
February 19-21, 2007. We also observed an outburst at mm and then at cm
wavelengths, with an increasing time delay going toward lower frequencies
during the rising phase. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that the 1 mm and
37 GHz flux variations lagged behind the R-band ones by about 3 weeks and 2
months, respectively. These short time delays suggest that the corresponding
jet emitting regions are only slightly separated and/or misaligned. In
contrast, during the outburst decreasing phase the flux faded contemporaneously
at all cm wavelengths. This abrupt change in the emission behaviour may suggest
the presence of some shutdown mechanism of intrinsic or geometric nature. The
behaviour of the UV flux closely follows the optical and near-IR one. By
separating the synchrotron and extra component contributions to the UV flux, we
found that they correlate, which suggests that the two emissions have a common
origin.

Lennard-Jones forces plus the thermally averaged quadrupole-quadrupole
interaction. The properties discussed include the vapor-liquid coexistence
curve, the vapor pressure along coexistence, and the surface tension. The full
isotherms are also accessible over a wide range of temperatures and densities.
It is shown that the critical parameters (critical temperature, density, and
pressure) depend almost linearly on a quadrupolar parameter $q=Q^{*4} /T^*$,
$Q^*$ is the reduced quadrupole moment of the molecule and $T^*$ the reduced
temperature.
  The model can be applied to a variety of small quadrupolar molecules. We
focus on carbon dioxide as a test case, but consider nitrogen and benzene, too.
Experimental critical temperature, density and quadrupolar moment are
sufficient to fix the parameters of the model. The resulting agreement with
experiments is excellent and marks a significant improvement over approaches
which neglect quadrupolar effects. The same coarse-grained model was also
applied in the framework of Perturbation Theory (PT) in the Mean Spherical
Approximation (MSA). As expected, the latter deviates from the Monte Carlo
results in the critical region, but is reasonably accurate at lower
temperatures.

netw orks, to more than two signal variants and we find a phenomenon during
network g rowth which we interpret as `complexity threshold'. For simulation we
define a simplified algorithm which allows us to omit the problem of periodic
attractors. We estimate that living and human designed systems are chaotic (in
Kauffman sens e) which can be named - complex. Such systems grow in adaptive
evolution. These two simple assumptions lead to certain statistical effects
i.e. structural tendencies observed in classic biology but still not explained
and not investigated on theoretical way. E.g. terminal modifications or
terminal predominance of additions where terminal means: near system outputs.
We introduce more than two equally probable variants of signal, therefore our
networks generally are not Boolean networks. T hey grow randomly by additions
and removals of nodes imposed on Darwinian elimination. Fitness is defined on
external outputs of system. During growth of the system we observe a phase
transition to chaos (threshold of complexity) in damage spreading. Above this
threshold we identify mechanisms of structural tendencies which we investigate
in simulation for a few different networks types, including scale-free BA
networks.

anomalous alignment of vorticity with the intermediate eigenvector of the total

$|\phi_{S}|$ can arbitrarily be small compared with the right-handed Majorana
mass parameter $|M|$ and thus the seesaw condition $0<|\phi_{S}|\ll|M|$ can be
satisfied by a fine tuning of the coupling constant, while at the first-order
case it seems very difficult and/or ""unnatural"" to satisfy the condition. The
numerical results do not depend on the difference of the cutoff schemes
qualitatively.

  rephrased to fit in; V2: some problem in the latex of V1 fixed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  It is widely accepted that the large obliquity of Uranus is the result of a
great tangential collision (GC) with an Earth size proto-planet at the end of
the accretion. We attempt to constraint the GC scenario as the cause of Uranus'
obliquity as well as on the mechanisms able to give origin to the Uranian
irregulars. Different capture mechanisms for irregulars operate at different
stages on the giant planets formation process. The mechanisms able to capture
the uranian irregulars before and after the GC are analysed. Assuming that they
were captured before the GC, we calculate the orbital transfer of the nine
irregulars by the impulse imparted by the GC. If their orbital transfer results
dynamically implausible, they should have originated after the GC. We
investigate and discuss the dissipative mechanisms able to operate later. In
particular Prospero could not exist at the time of the GC. Different capture
mechanisms for Prospero after the GC are investigated. Gas drag by
Uranus'envelope and pull-down capture are not plausible mechanisms. Capture of
Prospero through a collisionless interaction seems to be difficult. The GC
itself provides a mechanism of permanent capture. However, the capture of
Prospero by the GC is a low probable event. Catastrophic collisions could be a
possible mechanism for the birth of Prospero and the other irregulars after the
GC. Orbital and physical clusterings should then be expected. Either Prospero
had to originate after the GC or the GC did not occur. In the former case, the
mechanism for the origin of Prospero after the GC remains an open question. In
the latter case, another theory to account for Uranus' obliquity and the
formation of the Uranian regular satellites on the equatorial plane of the
planet would be needed.

multi-wavelength observations of the TeV blazar Mrk 421 during February $-$
March 2003. In this period, we have observed Mrk 421 using Pachmarhi Array of
\v{C}erenkov Telescopes (PACT) of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at
Pachmarhi, India. Other simultaneous data were taken from the published
literature and public data archives. We have analyzed the high quality X-ray
(2-20 keV) observations from the NASA Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We
have seen a possible correlated variability between X-ray and J band (1.25
$\mu$) near infrared (NIR) wavelength. This is the first case of X-ray and NIR
correlated variability in Mrk 421 or any high energy peaked (HBL) blazar. The
correlated variability reported here is indicating a similar origin for NIR and
X-ray emission. The emission is not affected much by the environment of the
surrounding medium around the central engine of the Mrk 421. The observations
are consistent with the shock-in-jet model for the emission of radiations.

through a noise modelled by a depolarizing channel. Two types of error are
introduced characterizing the qubit time evolution and gate application, so the
noise is directly related to the quantum network construction. The numerical
simulation concludes an exponential damping law for the successive probability
of the maxima as time increases. We have obtained an allowed-error law for the
algorithm: the error threshold for the allowed noise behaves as Eth(N) ~ 1/N1.1
(N being the size of the data set). As the power of N is almost one, we
consider the Grover algorithm as robust to a certain extent against
decoherence. This law also provides an absolute threshold: if the free
evolution error is greater than 0.043, Grover algorithm does not work for any
number of qubits affected by the present error model. The improvement in the
probability of success, in the case of two qubits has been illustrated by using
a fault-tolerant encoding of the initial state by means of the [[7,1,3]]
quantum code.

quasars) are highly attenuated in the X-ray regime compared to other quasars,
especially in the soft band ($< $ 1 keV). Using X-ray selection techniques we
have found ""soft X-ray loud"" BALQSOs that, by definition, have soft X-ray (0.3
keV) to UV ($3000 \AA$) flux density ratios that are higher than typical nonBAL
radio quiet quasars. Our sample of 3 sources includes one LoBALQSO (low
ionization BALQSO) which are generally considered to be the most highly
attenuated in the X-rays. The three QSOs are the only known BALQSOs that have
X-ray observations that are consistent with no intrinsic soft X-ray absorption.
The existence of a large X-ray luminosity and the hard ionizing continuum that
it presents to potential UV absorption gas is in conflict with the ionization
states that are conducive to line driving forces within BAL winds (especially
for the LoBALs).
