regions are obscured by large amounts of gas and dust. In this paper, we
present a catalog of type 2 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
selected based on their optical emission lines. The catalog contains 887
objects with redshifts z < 0.83; this is six times larger than the previous
version and is by far the largest sample of type 2 quasars in the literature.
We derive the [OIII]5008 luminosity function for 10^8.3 Lsun < L[OIII] < 10^10
Lsun (corresponding to intrinsic luminosities up to M[2400A]-28 mag or
bolometric luminosities up to 4x10^47 erg/sec). This luminosity function
provides strong lower limits to the actual space density of obscured quasars,
due to our selection criteria, the details of the spectroscopic target
selection, as well as other effects. We derive the equivalent luminosity
function for the complete sample of type 1 (unobscured) quasars; then, we
determine the ratio of type 2/type 1 quasar number densities. Our best data
constrain this ratio to be at least 1.5:1 for 10^8.3 Lsun < L[OIII] < 10^9.5
Lsun at z < 0.3, and at least 1.2:1 for L[OIII]=10^10 Lsun at 0.3 < z < 0.83.
Type 2 quasars are at least as abundant as type 1 quasars in the relatively
nearby Universe (z < 0.8) for the highest luminosities.

toward the description of the geometry of quantum constrained systems. We make
use of the geometric formulation of quantum theory in which unitary
transformations (including time evolution) can be seen, just as in the
classical case, as finite canonical transformations on the quantum state space.
We compare from this perspective the classical and quantum formalisms and argue
that there is an important difference between them, that suggests that the
condition on observables to become physical is through the double commutator
with the square of the constraint operator. This provides a bridge between the
standard Dirac procedure --through its geometric implementation-- and the
Master Constraint program.

the 2-body interaction satisfied exactly the unitary limit i.e. infinite
scattering length and effective range r_0=0. In the present report results with
r_0>0are shown. A strong dependence on the effective range is found. It is for
example found that an increase to r_0=1 fm increases xi to ~ 0.4 close to other
reports of xi in the unitary limit. It is concluded that because of the
singular character of the unitary limit it is necessary to verify that the
interaction actually satisfies unitarity.

the in-medium interaction close to (and in) the unitary limit. This was already

substructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. We extend prior work on
the subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physically
associated with the main system. These are defined as subhalos that have at
some time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's main
progenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. We find that
this population extends beyond {\it three times} the virial radius, and
contains objects on extreme orbits. We trace the origin of these unorthodox
orbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results in
the ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. Ejected subhalos are
primarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatial
distribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, the
less centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendant
population. The bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, but
disappears at the low-mass end. Our findings imply that subhalos identified
within the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructure
physically related to a halo: only about {\it one half} of all associated
subhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo. These results may
explain the age dependence of the clustering of low-mass halos, and has
implications for (i) the interpretation of the structural parameters and
assembly histories of halos neighboring massive systems; (ii) the existence of
low-mass dynamical outliers in the Local Group; and (iii) the presence of
evidence for evolutionary effects well outside the traditional virial boundary
of a galaxy system.

bounds on CFT operator dimensions,e.g. d\geq 3 for primary, gauge invariant,
vector unparticle operators. We correct the results in the literature to
account for this, and also for a needed correction in the form of the
propagator for vector and tensor unparticles. We show that the unitarity
constraints can be directly related to unitarity requirements on scattering
amplitudes of particles, e.g. those of the standard model, coupled to the CFT
operators. We also stress the existence of explicit standard model contact
terms, which are generically induced by the coupling to the CFT (or any other
hidden sector), and are subject to LEP bounds. Barring an unknown mechanism to
tune away these contact interactions, they can swamp interference effects
generated by the CFT. We illustrate these points in the context of a weakly
coupled CFT example. A significant amount of the unparticle literature should
be reconsidered in light of the observations in this note.

within the framework of these models capacity is determined for the first

which are achievable with a straightforward time-sharing approach. A capacity
achieving coding strategy is presented based on allocating the transmit and
receive time slots of a node in dependence of the node's previously received
data. For the networks of the second type, an upper bound to the rate region is
derived from the cut-set bound. Further, achievability of the cut-set bound in
the single relay case is shown given that the source rate exceeds a certain
minimum value.

mean rank-three tensors with antisymmetrized upper/lower indices, using the
AKSZ construction. Generically these are topological membrane models, and we
show that the fluxes are related to deformations of the Courant bracket which
generalize the twist by a closed 3-from $H$, in the sense that satisfying the
AKSZ master equation implies the integrability conditions for an almost
generalized complex structure with respect to the deformed Courant bracket. In
addition, the master equation imposes conditions on the fluxes that generalize
$dH=0$. The membrane model can be defined on a large class of $U(m)$- and $U(m)
\times U(m)$-structure manifolds, including geometries inspired by $(1,1)$
supersymmetric $\sigma$-models with additional supersymmetries due to almost
complex (but not necessarily complex) structures in the target space.
Furthermore, we show that the model can be defined on three particular
half-flat manifolds related to the Iwasawa manifold.
  When only $H$-flux is turned on it is possible to obtain a topological string
model, which we do for the case of a Calabi-Yau with a closed 3-form turned on.
The simplest deformation from the A-model is due to the $(2,0)+ (0,2)$
component of a non-trivial $b$-field. The model is generically no longer
evaluated on holomorphic maps and defines new topological invariants.
Deformations due to $H$-flux can be more radical, completely preventing
auxiliary fields from being integrated out.

oscillator modes takes place. Coherency is however degraded as far as the
oscillator mass increases producing a increasingly large recoherence time.
Calculations are carried on by exact diagonalization and compared with two
semiclassical approximations. The role of the quantum effects are highlighted
in the long-time dynamics, where semiclassical approaches give rise to a
dissipative behaviour. Moreover, we find that the oscillator dynamics has to be

tool, this algorithm presents strong limitations when applied to data with a
low signal-to-noise ratio. We analyze the artifacts that the phase selfcal
algorithm produces when applied to extremely noisy data. We show how the phase
selfcal may generate a spurious source in the sky from a distribution of
completely random visibilities. This spurious source is indistinguishable from
a real one. We numerically and analytically compute the relationship between
the maximum spurious flux density generated by selfcal from noise and the
particulars of the interferometric observations. Finally, we present two simple
tests that can be applied to interferometric data for checking whether a source
detection is real or whether the source is an artifact of the phase
self-calibration algorithm.

in the gauge-invariant way from the pure Yang--Mills theory even in the absence
of the Higgs scalar field, in sharp contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic
monopole in the Georgi-Glashow gauge-Higgs model. The resulting representation
indicates that the Wilson loop operator in fundamental representations can be a
probe for a single magnetic monopole irrespective of $N$ in SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory, against the conventional wisdom. Moreover, we show that the
quantization condition for the magnetic charge follows from the fact that the
non-Abelian Stokes theorem does not depend on the surface chosen for writing
the surface integral. The obtained geometrical and topological representations
of the Wilson loop operator have important implications to understanding quark
confinement according to the dual superconductor picture.

forms, it necessarily includes a vocabulary of terms and some specification of
their meaning in relation to the domain's conceptualization. And as domain
knowledge is mainly conveyed through scientific and technical texts, we can
hope to extract some useful information from them for building ontology. But is
it as simple as this? In this article we shall see that the lexical structure,
i.e. the network of words linked by linguistic relationships, does not
necessarily match the domain conceptualization. We have to bear in mind that
writing documents is the concern of textual linguistics, of which one of the
principles is the incompleteness of text, whereas building ontology - viewed as
task-independent knowledge - is concerned with conceptualization based on
formal and not natural languages. Nevertheless, the famous Sapir and Whorf
hypothesis, concerning the interdependence of thought and language, is also
applicable to formal languages. This means that the way an ontology is built
and a concept is defined depends directly on the formal language which is used;
and the results will not be the same. The introduction of the notion of
ontoterminology allows to take into account epistemological principles for
formal ontology building.

the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to

material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi
surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to
have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected ""Fermi arcs"". The
fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi
surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the
overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the
electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5,
establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state
of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic
field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small
pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped
regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is
part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from
a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our
understanding of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductors will
depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.

continuous space by a finite matrix algebra. In the limit of infinitely large
matrices the formulation is exact. An attractive feature of this approach is
that it transparently shows how the geometrical properties of the continuous
space are preserved. In the study of the non-perturbative regime of QFT, fuzzy
spaces provide a possible alternative to the lattice as a regularisation
method. The thesis is divided into two parts. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations of a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We
identify the phase diagram of this model. In addition to the usual disordered
and uniform ordered phases we find a third phase of non-uniform ordering. This
indicates the existence of the phenomenon called UV-IR mixing in the strong
coupling regime. Second we present a geometrical analysis of the scalar field
theory on a 4-dimensional fuzzy sphere, S4_F. Nevertheless a fuzzy version of
S4 cannot be achieved by quantisation of the classical space. The problem is
circumvented by defining a scalar theory on a larger space, CP3 which is
6-dimensional. It includes degrees of freedom related to S^4 plus others beyond
S4. Those extra degrees of freedom are dynamically suppressed through a
probabilistic method. The analysis of the geometrical structures allows us to
interpret this procedure as a Kaluza-Klein reduction of CP3 to S4.

The film composite structure was characterized as p-type magnetic semiconductor
at 300 K with a carrier density of the order of $ 10^{22} /{\rm cm^3}$. The
hole carriers were excited at the interface between the nano granular Fe and

semiconductor interface commonly observed in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS)

$O[g^6\ln(1/g)+\delta]$, incorporates some non-perturbative effects. Following
a recent work (Physical Review {\bf C 76}, 054909(2007)), the interaction
effects contained in the EOS are encapsulated in terms of effective chemical
potentials($\tilde\mu$) in the equilibrium distribution functions for the
partons.By using them in another recent formulation of the response
functions({\tt arXiv:0707.3697}), we determine explicitly the chromo-electric
susceptibilities for QCD plasma. We find that it shows large deviations from
the ideal behavior. We further study the modification in the heavy quark
potential due to the medium effects. In particular, we determine the
temperature dependence of the screening lengths by fixing the effective
coupling constant $Q$ which appears in the transport equation by comparing the
screening in the present formalism with exact lattice QCD results. Finally, we
study the dissociation phenomena of heavy quarkonium states such as $c\bar{c}$

account both dissipation terms due to thermal conduction and dispersive quantum
terms due to the Bohm potential. Unlike quantum systems without dissipations,
even a small thermal conduction may lead to a stationary shock structure. In
the limit of zero quantum effects, the monotonic Burgers solution for the weak
shock is recovered. Still, even small quantum terms make the structure
non-monotonic with the shock driving a train of oscillations into the initial
plasma. The oscillations propagate together with the shock. The oscillations
become stronger as the role of Bohm potential increases in comparison with
thermal conduction. The results could be of importance for laser-plasma
interactions, such as inertial confinement fusion plasmas, and in astrophysical
environments, as well as in condensed matter systems.

consume the substrates either sequentially or simultaneously. These growth
patterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of
these growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism
common to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal
model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes
observed in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells.
Here, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We
show that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific
regulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted
for by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for
continuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any
given dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation
for the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch
and continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in
excellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the
steady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during
the single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various
dilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated
by simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady
states of continuous cultures. The minimal model provides a framework for
quantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by
analyzing several data sets from the literature.

formalism that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials
(media) via two-point correlation functions S2 and introduced an efficient
heterogeneous-medium (re)construction algorithm called the ""lattice-point""
algorithm. Here we discuss the algorithmic details of the lattice-point
procedure and an algorithm modification using surface optimization to further
speed up the (re)construction process. The importance of the error tolerance,
which indicates to what accuracy the media are (re)constructed, is also
emphasized and discussed. We apply the algorithm to generate three-dimensional
digitized realizations of a Fontainebleau sandstone and a boron
carbide/aluminum composite from the two- dimensional tomographic images of
their slices through the materials. To ascertain whether the information
contained in S2 is sufficient to capture the salient structural features, we
compute the two-point cluster functions of the media, which are superior
signatures of the micro-structure because they incorporate the connectedness
information. We also study the reconstruction of a binary laser-speckle pattern
in two dimensions, in which the algorithm fails to reproduce the pattern
accurately. We conclude that in general reconstructions using S2 only work well
for heterogeneous materials with single-scale structures. However, two-point
information via S2 is not sufficient to accurately model multi-scale media.
Moreover, we construct realizations of hypothetical materials with desired
structural characteristics obtained by manipulating their two-point correlation
functions.

states, the sample dependence of the nu=5/2 state clearly shows that disorder
plays an important role in determining the energy gap at nu=5/2. For the
developing nu=19/8 FQHE state the temperature dependence of the Rxx minimum
implies an energy gap of ~5mK.The energy gaps of the odd-denominator FQHE
states at nu=7/3 and 8/3 also increase with decreasing disorder, similar to the
gap at 5/2 state. Unexpectedly and contrary to earlier data on lower mobility
samples, in this ultra-high quality specimen, the nu=13/5 state is missing,
while its particle-hole conjugate state, the nu=12/5 state, is a fully
developed FQHE state. We speculate that this disappearance might indicate a
spin polarization of the nu=13/5 state. Finally, the temperature dependence is
studied for the two-reentrant integer quantum Hall states around nu=5/2 and is
found to show a very narrow temperature range for the transition from quantized

which gives the response to imposed test fields, that is, mean magnetic fields
with various wavenumbers. Both an imposed fully helical steady flow consisting
of a pattern of screw-like motions (Roberts flow) and time-dependent
statistically steady isotropic turbulence are considered. In the latter case
the aforementioned evolution equations are solved simultaneously with the
momentum and continuity equations. The corresponding results for the
electromotive force are used to calculate alpha and magnetic diffusivity
tensors. Results: For both the Roberts flow under the second--order correlation
approximation and isotropic turbulence alpha and turbulent magnetic diffusivity
are largest at large scales and these values diminish toward smaller scales. In
both cases the alpha effect and turbulent diffusion kernels are well
approximated by exponentials, corresponding to Lorentzian profiles in Fourier
space. For isotropic turbulence the turbulent diffusion kernel is half as wide
as the alpha effect kernel. For the Roberts flow beyond the second--order
correlation approximation the turbulent diffusion kernel becomes negative at
large scales.

We show that the long conductive timescale above the convective zone and the

modeled with an ac voltage over the contact. We first show how the low-bias
transmission function can be obtained analytically, using methods previously
employed for simpler chain models. In particular, the decay coefficient of the
off-resonant transmission is extracted by considering both a finite-length
chain and infinitely extended polyphenylene. Based on these analytical results,
we discuss the length-dependence of the linear-response conductance, the
thermopower, and the light-induced enhancement of the conductance in the limit
of weak intensity and low frequency. In general the conductance-enhancement is
calculated numerically as a function of the light frequency. Finally, we
compute the current-voltage characteristics at finite dc voltages, and show
that in the low-voltage regime, the effect of low-frequency light is to induce
current steps with a voltage separation determined by twice the frequency.
These effects are more pronounced for longer molecules. We study two different
profiles for the dc and ac voltages, and it is found that the results are
robust with respect to such variations. Although we concentrate here on the
specific model of oligophenylenes, the results should be qualitatively similar
for many other organic molecules with a large enough electronic gap.

symplectically aspherical (i.e. the symplectic form and the first Chern class
vanish on \pi_2(M)) then the spectral invariants, which are initially defined
on the universal cover of the Hamiltonian group, descend to the Hamiltonian
group Ham (M,\om). In this note we describe less stringent conditions on the
Chern class and quantum homology of M under which the (asymptotic) spectral
invariants descend to Ham (M,\om). For example, they descend if the quantum
multiplication of M is undeformed and H_2(M) has rank >1, or if the minimal
Chern number is at least n+1 (where \dim M=2n) and the even cohomology of M is
generated by divisors. The proofs are based on certain calculations of genus
zero Gromov--Witten invariants.
  As an application, we show that the Hamiltonian group of the one point blow
up of T^4 admits a Calabi quasimorphism. Moreover, whenever the (asymptotic)
spectral invariants descend it is easy to see that Ham (M,\om) has infinite
diameter in the Hofer norm. Hence our results establish the infinite diameter
of Ham in many new cases. We also show that the area pseudonorm -- a geometric
version of the Hofer norm -- is nontrivial on the (compactly supported)
Hamiltonian group for all noncompact manifolds as well as for a large class of
closed manifolds.

Cepheid variables. A number of recent works have proposed that non-canonical
mass-loss can account for the mass discrepancy. This mass-loss would be such
that a 5Mo star loses approximately 20% of its mass by arriving at the Cepheid
instability strip; a 14Mo star, none. Such findings would pose a serious
challenge to our understanding of mass-loss. I revisit these results in light
of the Padova stellar evolutionary models and find evolutionary masses are
($17\pm5$)% greater than pulsation masses for Cepheids between 5<M/Mo<14. I
find that mild internal mixing in the main-sequence progenitor of the Cepheid
are able to account for this mass discrepancy.

second peak in the WDLF. Canonical WD models seem to fail --at least at
~25%-level-- in reproducing the age of clusters of this metallicity. We discuss

temperatures. The theory can deal with the sign, the ordinary and the anomalous
contributions to the Hall effect. When applied to include the spin-orbit
interaction to first order, we recover what is essentially the
Karplus-Luttinger result for the anomalous Hall effect. Contact is made to the
Chazalviel and Nozieres-Lewiner formulae. A side-jump type formula is obtained
by using an exact application of linear response. We show that there exists an
exact rigid Hall current which is not a Fermi level property. We introduce a
relationship between mass and diffusivity which allows us to generalize the
theory to strong disorder and even introduce a mobility edge. The formalism
provides a systematic and practical way of analyzing both ordinary and
anomalous contributions to the Hall conduction including the changes of sign,
and in the presence of serious disorder. As a byproduct of the method, we show
that the anomalous Hall coefficient can vary with resistance to the power n,

resulted in low intrinsic critical current density (Jc0) without degrading the
thermal-stability factor (E/kBT, where E, kB, and T are the energy potential,
the Boltzmann constant, and temperature,respectively). When the two CoFeB
layers of a strongly antiferromagnetically coupled SyF free layer had the same
thickness, Jc0 was reduced to 2-4x10^6 A/cm^2. This low Jc0 may be due to the
decreased effective volume under the large spin accumulation at the CoFeB/Ru.
The E/kBT was over 60, resulting in a retention time of over ten years and
suppression of the write current dispersion for SPRAM. The use of the SyF free
layer also resulted in a bistable (parallel/antiparallel) magnetization
configuration at zero field, enabling the realization of CIMS without the need
to apply external fields to compensate for the offset field.

found that Kozai mechanism by outer planets is responsible for the formation of
close-in planets. During the three-planet orbital crossing, the Kozai
excitation is repeated and the eccentricity is often increased secularly to
values close enough to unity for tidal circularization to transform the inner
planet to a close-in planet. Since a moderate eccentricity can remain for the
close-in planet, this mechanism may account for the observed close-in planets
with moderate eccentricities and without nearby secondary planets. Since these
planets also remain a broad range of orbital inclinations (even retrograde
ones), the contribution of this process would be clarified by more observations

of the surface turbulent convection or a direct forcing by buoyancy. Method:
Using the 14-Mpixel CALAS camera at the Pic-du-Midi observatory, we obtained a
7.5h-long sequence of high resolution images with unprecedented field size.
Tracking granules, we have determined the velocity field at the Sun's surface
in great detail from a scale of 2.5Mm up to 250Mm.
  Results: The kinetic energy density spectrum shows that supergranulation
peaks at 36Mm and spans on scales ranging between 20Mm and 75Mm. The decrease
of supergranular flows in the small scales is close to a $k^{-2}$-power law,
steeper than the equipartition Kolmogorov one. The probability distribution
function of the divergence field shows the signature of intermittency of the
supergranulation and thus its turbulent nature.

presented as a mathematical extension of a nonuniform oscillator. The system
exhibits a nonchaotic stagnant motion, which is reminiscent of intermittent
chaos. In fact, the density function of residence times near stagnation points
obeys an inverse-square law, due to a mechanism similar to type-I
intermittency. However, unlike intermittent chaos, in which the alternation
between long stagnant phases and rapid moving phases occurs in a random manner,
here the alternation occurs in a quasiperiodic manner. In particular, in case
of a gradient with the golden ratio, the renewal of the largest residence time
occurs at positions corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence. Finally, the
asymptotic long-time behavior, in the form of a nested logarithm, is
theoretically derived. Compared with the Pomeau-Manneville intermittency, a
significant difference in the relaxation property of the long-time average of
the dynamical variable is found.

unified field theoretic formalism for dense skyrmion matter using a single
Lagrangian to describe simultaneously both matter and meson fluctuations and
studied in-medium properties of hadrons. The effective theory used is the
Skyrme model Lagrangian gauged with the vector mesons rho and omega,
implemented with the dilaton field that describes the spontaneously broken
scale symmetry of QCD, in a form consistent with the symmetries of QCD and our
expectations regarding the high density limit. We analyze the restoration of
scale invariance and chiral symmetry as the density of the system increases. In
order to preserve the restoration of scale symmetry and chiral symmetry,
signalled in our case by the vanishing of the expectation value of the dilaton,
and to be consistent with the vector manifestation of hidden local symmetry, a
density dependent omega coupling is introduced. We uncover the crucial role
played by both the dilaton and the omega meson in the phase structure of dense

can be understood as corresponding to times that are respectively much shorter
and much longer than a magnetization timescale, as in a recent field
theoretical analysis of the $n$-vector model. We calculate exactly the
crossover functions interpolating between these two limits, for the
magnetization correlator and response and the resulting fluctuation-dissipation
ratio (FDR). For $d>4$ our results match those obtained recently from a
Gaussian field theory. For $d<4$, non-Gaussian fuctuations arising from the
spherical constraint need to be accounted for. We extend our framework from the
fully magnetized case to achieve this, providing an exact solution for the
relevant integral kernel. The resulting crossover behaviour is very rich, with
the asymptotic FDR $X^\infty$ depending non-monotonically on the scaled age of
the system. This is traced back to non-monotonicities of the two-time
correlator, themselves the consequence of large magnetization fluctuations on
the crossover timescale. We correct a trivial error in our earlier calculation
for fully magnetized initial states; the corrected FDR is {\em consistent} with
renormalization group expansions to first order in $4-d$ for the longitudinal
fluctuations of the O(n) model in the limit $n\to\infty$.

deposited at different conditions on silicon or mica substrates. Considerable
variation of the frequency dependent dielectric function from sample to sample

It was found that the plasma frequency varies in the range from 6.8 eV to 8.4

reflectivity measurements support qualitatively this conclusion. The Casimir
force is evaluated for the dielectric functions corresponding to our samples,

for our films was found to be 5-14% smaller at a distance of 100 nm between the

computed with a numerical effort comparable to that of a \emph{single} standard
ground-state calculation. This method is particularly well suited for large
systems and/or large basis sets, such as plane waves or real-space grids. By
using a super-operator formulation of linearized time-dependent
density-functional theory, we first represent the dynamical polarizability of
an interacting-electron system as an off-diagonal matrix element of the
resolvent of the Liouvillian super-operator. One-electron operators and density
matrices are treated using a representation borrowed from time-independent
density-functional perturbation theory, which permits to avoid the calculation
of unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. The resolvent of the Liouvillian is evaluated
through a newly developed algorithm based on the non-symmetric Lanczos method.
Each step of the Lanczos recursion essentially requires twice as many
operations as a single step of the iterative diagonalization of the unperturbed
Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Suitable extrapolation of the Lanczos coefficients
allows for a dramatic reduction of the number of Lanczos steps necessary to
obtain well converged spectra, bringing such number down to hundreds (or a few
thousands, at worst) in typical plane-wave pseudopotential applications. The
resulting numerical workload is only a few times larger than that needed by a
ground-state Kohn-Sham calculation for a same system. Our method is
demonstrated with the calculation of the spectra of benzene, C$_{60}$

Depending on the structural parameters $u$ and $v$, the networks are either
fractals with a finite fractal dimension $d_{f}$ or transfinite fractals
(transfractal) with a infinite fractal dimension. The scaling behavior of
degree and dimensionality are studied analytically and by simulations, which
are found to be different from those in ordered recursive networks. The
transfractal dimension $\tilde{d}_f$, which is recently introduced to
distinguish the differences between networks with infinite fractal dimension,
scales as $\tilde{d}_f\sim \frac{1}{u+v-1}$ for transfractal networks.
Interestingly, the fractal dimension for fractal networks with $u=v$ is found
to approach 3 in large limit of $u$, which is thought to be the effect of
disorder. We also investigate the diffusion process on this family of networks,
and the scaling behavior of diffusion time is observed numercally as $\tau\sim
N^{(d_{f}+1)/d_{f}}$ for fractal networks and $\tau\sim \frac{1}{\tilde{d}_f}N$
for transfractal ons. We think that the later relation will give a further
understanding of transfractal dimension.

transition between a consensus and a polarization phase at a critical global
bound of confidence. In this paper, heterogeneous bounds of confidence are
studied. The surprising result is that a society of agents with two different
bounds of confidence (open-minded and closed-minded agents) can find consensus
even when both bounds of confidence are significantly below the critical bound
of confidence of a homogeneous society.
  The phenomenon is shown by examples of agent-based simulation and by
numerical computation of the time evolution of the agents density. The result
holds for the bounded confidence model of Deffuant, Weisbuch and others
(Weisbuch, G. et al; Meet, discuss, and segregate!, Complexity, 2002, 7,
55--63), as well as for the model of Hegselmann and Krause (Hegselmann, R.,
Krause, U.; Opinion Dynamics and Bounded Confidence, Models, Analysis and
Simulation, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 2002, 5, 2).
  Thus, given an average level of confidence, diversity of bounds of confidence
enhances the chances for consensus. The drawback of this enhancement is that
opinion dynamics becomes suspect to severe drifts of clusters, where
open-minded agents can pull closed-minded agents towards another cluster of
closed-minded agents. A final consensus might thus not lie in the center of the
opinion interval as it happens for uniform initial opinion distributions under
homogeneous bounds of confidence. It can be located at extremal locations. This
is demonstrated by example.
  This also show that the extension to heterogeneous bounds of confidence
enriches the complexity of the dynamics tremendously.

Galactic outflows are modeled in a manner akin to models of stellar wind blown
bubbles. Large scale outflows can generically escape from low mass halos
(M<10^9 M_sun) for a wide range of model parameters but not from high mass
halos (M> 10^{11} M_sun). The gas phase metallicity of the outflow and within
the galaxy are computed. Ionization states of different metal species are
calculated and used to examine the detectability of metal lines from the
outflows. The global influence of galactic outflows is also investigated.
Models with only atomic cooled halos significantly fill the IGM at z~3 with
metals (with -2.5>[Z/Z_sun]>-3.7), the actual extent depending on the
efficiency of winds, the IMF, the fractional mass that goes through star
formation and the reionization history of the universe. In these models, a
large fraction of outflows at z~3 are supersonic, hot (T> 10^5 K) and have low
density, making metal lines difficult to detect. They may also result in
significant perturbations in the IGM gas on scales probed by the Lyman-alpha
forest. On the contrary, models including molecular cooled halos with a normal
mode of star formation can potentially volume fill the universe at z> 8 without
drastic dynamic effects on the IGM, thereby setting up a possible metallicity
floor (-4.0<[Z/Z_sun]<-3.6). Interestingly, molecular cooled halos with a
``top-heavy'' mode of star formation are not very successful in establishing
the metallicity floor because of the additional radiative feedback, that they
induce. (Abridged)

in determining the mass and energy exchange between the clouds and the hot
surrounding medium. We perform 2.5D MHD simulations of a shock impacting on an
isolated gas cloud, including anisotropic thermal conduction and radiative
cooling; we consider the representative case of a Mach 50 shock impacting on a
cloud ten-fold denser than the ambient medium. We consider different
configurations of the ambient magnetic field and compare MHD models with or
without the thermal conduction. The efficiency of the thermal conduction in the
presence of magnetic field is, in general, reduced with respect to the
unmagnetized case. The reduction factor strongly depends on the initial
magnetic field orientation, and it is minimum when the magnetic field is
initially aligned with the direction of shock propagation. The thermal
conduction contributes to suppress hydrodynamic instabilities, reducing the
mass mixing of the cloud and preserving the cloud from complete fragmentation.
Depending on the magnetic field orientation, the heat conduction may determine
a significant energy exchange between the cloud and the hot surrounding medium
which, while remaining always at levels less than those in the unmagnetized
case, leads to a progressive heating and evaporation of the cloud. This
additional heating may contrast the radiative cooling of some parts of the
cloud, preventing the onset of thermal instabilities.

can expect the prompt photon rate $\sim 10^{2}$ photons per second.
  Direct photons from the hadron scenario of ion collisions generated by the
Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach with implemented meson
scatterings $\pi\rho\to\pi\gamma, \pi\pi\to\rho\gamma$ have been analyzed.
Photons from short-living resonances (e.g. $\omega \to \pi^{0} \gamma$)
decaying during the dense phase of the collision should be considered as direct
photons. They contribute significantly in the direct photon spectrum at
$p_{t}=0.5 - 1$ GeV/c. At the FAIR energy 25 AGeV in Au+Au central collisions
the HSD generator predicts, as a lower estimate,
$\gamma_{direct}/\gamma_{\pi^{0}} \simeq$ 0.5% in the region $p_{t}=0.5 - 1$
GeV/c. At $p_{t}=1.5 - 2$ GeV/c $\gamma_{prompt}/\gamma_{\pi^{0}} \simeq$ 2%.
  Thermal direct photons have been evaluated with the Bjorken Hydro-Dynamics

direct photon spectrum is very sensitive to the initial temperature parameter

  crystal nucleation in droplets","33 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1021/jp8008942",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A kinetic theory of homogeneous crystal nucleation in unary droplets is
presented taking into account that a crystal nucleus can form not only in the
volume-based mode (with all its facets within the droplet) but also in the
surface-stimulated one (with one of its facets at the droplet surface). The
previously developed thermodynamics of surface-stimulated crystal nucleation
rigorously showed that if at least one of the facets of the crystal is only
partially wettable by its melt, then it is thermodynamically more favorable for
the nucleus to form with that facet at the droplet surface rather than within
the droplet. So far, however, the kinetic aspects of this phenomenon had not
been studied at all. The theory proposed in the present paper advocates that
even in the surface-stimulated mode crystal nuclei initially emerge (as
sub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the sub-surface layer, not
""pseudo-heterogeneously"" at the surface. A homogeneously emerged sub-critical
crystal can become a surface-stimulated nucleus due to density and structure
fluctuations. This effect contributes to the total rate of crystal nucleation
(as the volume-based mode does). An explicit expression for the total
per-particle rate of crystal nucleation is derived. Numerical evaluations for
water droplets suggest that the surface-stimulated mode can significantly
enhance the per-particle rate of crystal nucleation in droplets as large as 10
microns in radius. Possible experimental verification of the proposed theory is
discussed.

strongly argues in favor of a complex structure. The analysis takes into
account arc positions, shapes and orientations and is done thoroughly in the
image plane. The cluster inner regions are well fitted by a bimodal mass
distribution, with a total projected mass of $M_{tot} = (9.9 \pm 0.3)\times
10^{14} M_\odot/h$ within a radius of $360 \mathrm{kpc}/h$ ($1.5'$). Such a
complex structure could be a signature of a recent major merger as further
supported by X-ray data. A temperature map of the cluster, based on deep
Chandra observations, reveals a hot front located between the first main
component and an X-ray emitting South Eastern sub-clump. The map also unveils a
filament of cold gas in the innermost regions of the cluster, most probably a
cooling wake caused by the motion of the cD inside the cool core region. A
merger scenario in the plane of the sky between two dark matter sub-clumps is
consistent with both our lensing and X-ray analyses, and can explain previous

type of the noisy channel. If, for example, the noisy channel is ($L_{2,x}$,

spiral-systems, in which all spiral-graphs have the same direction of rotation
and the same -- second difference -- between the numbers, which lie on these
spiral-graphs. A mathematical analysis shows, that these spiral graphs are
caused exclusively by quadratic polynomials. For example the well known Euler
Polynomial x2+x+41 appears on the Square Root Spiral in the form of three
spiral-graphs, which are defined by three different quadratic polynomials. All
natural numbers,divisible by a certain prime factor, also lie on defined spiral
graphs on the Square Root Spiral (or Spiral of Theodorus, or Wurzelspirale).
And the Square Numbers 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 even form a highly three-symmetrical
system of three spiral graphs, which divides the square root spiral into three
equal areas. Fibonacci number sequences also play a part in the structure of
the Square Root Spiral. With the help of the Number-Spiral, described by Mr.
Robert Sachs, a comparison can be drawn between the Square Root Spiral and the
Ulam Spiral. The shown sections of his study of the number spiral contain

described as a self-gravitating, possibly self-interacting, coherent scalar
field.
  On a scale larger than galaxies, dark matter behaves like cold dark matter
while below that scale the quantum mechanical nature suppresses the dark matter
structure formation due to the minimum length scale determined by the mass
$m\st{>}{\sim}10^{-24} eV$ and the self-interaction of the particles. This
property could alleviate the cusp problem and missing satellite problems of the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, this model well reproduces the observed
rotation curves of spiral and dwarf galaxies, which makes the model promising.

recent experimental results implicating that bubble deformation cannot account
for these experiments. Possible applications of bubble surfaces in microfluidic

missing, it has serious consequences for the interpretation of GRB jet
collimation and energy requirements, and the use of GRBs as standard candles.
  Here we address the issue of X-ray breaks which are possibly 'hidden' and
hence the light curves are misinterpreted as being single power-laws. We show
how a number of precedents, including GRB 990510 & GRB 060206, exist for such
hidden breaks and how, even with the well sampled light curves of the Swift
era, these breaks may be left misidentified. We do so by synthesising X-ray
light curves and finding general trends via Monte Carlo analysis. Furthermore,
in light of these simulations, we discuss how to best identify achromatic
breaks in afterglow light curves via multi-wavelength analysis.

energy cosmic rays in an inhomogeneously magnetized intergalactic medium. This
latter is modeled as a collection of magnetized scattering centers such as
radio cocoons, magnetized galactic winds, clusters or magnetized filaments of
large scale structure, with negligible magnetic fields in between. Magnetic
deflection is no longer a continuous process, it is rather dominated by
scattering events. We study the interaction between high energy cosmic rays and
the scattering agents. We then compute the optical depth of the Universe to
cosmic ray scattering and discuss the phenomological consequences for various
source scenarios. For typical parameters of the scattering centers, the optical
depth is greater than unity at 5x10^{19}eV, but the total angular deflection is
smaller than unity. One important consequence of this scenario is the
possibility that the last scattering center encountered by a cosmic ray be
mistaken with the source of this cosmic ray. In particular, we suggest that
part of the correlation recently reported by the Pierre Auger Observatory may
be affected by such delusion: this experiment may be observing in part the last
scattering surface of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays rather than their source
population. Since the optical depth falls rapidly with increasing energy, one
should probe the arrival directions of the highest energy events beyond
10^{20}eV on an event by event basis to circumvent this effect.
