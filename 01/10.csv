superconducting/normal/superconducting (S/N/S) Josephson junctions containing
either one or two extra terminals that connect to normal reservoirs. Currents
injected into the junctions from the normal reservoirs induce changes in the
electron energy distribution function, which can change the properties of the
junction. A simple experiment performed on a 3-terminal sample demonstrates
that quasiparticle current and supercurrent can coexist in the normal region of
the S/N/S junction. When larger voltages are applied to the normal reservoir,
the sign of the current-phase relation of the junction can be reversed,
creating a ""$\pi$-junction."" We compare quantitatively the maximum critical
currents obtained in 4-terminal $\pi$-junctions when the voltages on the normal
reservoirs have the same or opposite sign with respect to the superconductors.
We discuss the challenges involved in creating a ""Zeeman"" $\pi$-junction with a
parallel applied magnetic field and show in detail how the orbital effect
suppresses the critical current. Finally, when normal current and supercurrent
are simultaneously present in the junction, the distribution function develops
a spatially inhomogeneous component that can be interpreted as an effective
temperature gradient across the junction, with a sign that is controllable by
the supercurrent. Taken as a whole, these experiments illustrate the richness
and complexity of S/N/S Josephson junctions in nonequilibrium situations.

that one of the spectral swaps in the three-flavor scenario agrees with that in

radioactive bare nucleus which decays by emitting an electron into the open
atomic K shell BEFORE and DURING its weak decay by neutrino emission. The
initial nuclear state has a momentum spread required by Heisenberg. The wave
packet contains pairs of components with different momenta which can produce
neutrinos in two mass eigenstates with exactly the same energy and different
momenta. These neutrino amplitudes mix to produce a single electron-neutrino
state with the same energy. Since there is no information on which mass
eigenstates produced the neutrino this is a typical quantum mechanics
""two-slit"" or ""which path"" experiment. A transition between the same initial
and a final states can go via two paths with a phase difference producing
interference and oscillations. Here the two paths are in momentum space

obtained by following the nucleus before and during the decay. The analysis
starts with Stodolsky's proof that interference between states having different
energies cannot be observed in realistic experiments. Results then follow from
simple rigorous quantum mechanics without the hand waving and loopholes which

instrument at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), the Large Binocular Camera
(LBC). Each LBT telescope unit will be equipped with similar prime focus

red channel for imaging in the VRIz bands. The corrected field-of-view of each
camera is approximately 30 arcminutes in diameter, and the chip area is
equivalent to a 23x23 arcmin2 field. In this paper we also present the
commissioning results of the blue channel. The scientific and technical
performance of the blue channel was assessed by measurement of the astrometric
distortion, flat fielding, ghosts, and photometric calibrations. These
measurements were then used as input to a data reduction pipeline applied to
science commissioning data. The measurements completed during commissioning
show that the technical performance of the blue channel is in agreement with
original expectations. Since the red camera is very similar to the blue one we
expect similar performance from the commissioning that will be performed in the
following months in binocular configuration. Using deep UV image, acquired
during the commissioning of the blue camera, we derived faint UV galaxy-counts
in a ~500 sq. arcmin. sky area to U(Vega)=26.5. These galaxy counts imply that
the blue camera is the most powerful UV imager presently available and in the
near future in terms of depth and extent of the field-of-view. We emphasize the
potential of the blue camera to increase the robustness of the UGR multicolour
selection of Lyman break galaxies at redshift z~3.

steeper ($\beta\simeq$ 5-6), which may be the imprint of their origin of

around an O6.5V star in the $\sim 3.9$ days orbit. The model assumes two
different sets of power-law spectral parameters of the interacting primary
leptons corresponding to the two orbital phase intervals defined by H.E.S.S. as

concentrated gravitational potential. The stellar velocity dispersion of the
bulge is ~60 km/s -- implying on a nuclear black hole mass of ~10^6 M_sun --
within which patches of lower velocity dispersion suggest the presence of
regions of more recent star formation. The Brgamma emission-line shows no
rotation as well as no blueshifts or redshifts in excess of 30 km/s, and is
thus not restricted to the galaxy plane. The [CaVIII] coronal region is compact
but resolved, extending over the inner 75 pc. It shows the highest blueshifts

to outflows from the active nucleus, supporting an origin close to the nucleus.
Subtraction of the stellar velocity field from the gaseous velocity field has
allowed us to isolate non-circular motions observed in the H_2 emitting gas.
The most conspicuous kinematic structures are two nuclear spiral arms. We
interpret these structures as inflows towards the nucleus, a result similar to
those of previous studies in which we have found streaming motions along
nuclear spirals in ionized gas using optical IFU observations. We have
calculated the mass inflow rate along the nuclear spiral arms, obtaining

background (CMB) radiation temperature anisotropy observations made with the
Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) operating at 150 GHz. We
include new data from the final 2005 observing season, expanding the number of
detector-hours by 210% and the sky coverage by 490% over that used for the
previous ACBAR release. As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been
reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third
to fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum.
The calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6% to 2.1% in temperature
through a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that
of the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is
consistent with a spatially flat, LambdaCDM cosmological model. We include the
effects of weak lensing in the power spectrum model computations and find that
this significantly improves the fits of the models to the combined ACBAR+WMAP5
power spectrum. The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with
theoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1
sigma) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies. We
expect any excess power to be dominated by the combination of emission from
dusty protogalaxies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the
excess observed by ACBAR is significantly smaller than the excess power at ell
> 2000 reported by the CBI experiment operating at 30 GHz. Therefore, while it
is unlikely that the CBI excess has a primordial origin; the combined ACBAR and
CBI results are consistent with the source of the CBI excess being either the
SZE or radio source contamination.

its CO-luminous region. Fueled by this large gas reservoir this galaxy is the
site of an intense starburst with $\rm SFR\sim 370 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, placing
it firmly on the upper gas-rich/star-forming end of Ultra Luminous Infrared

first case of extreme starburst and powerful QSO activity, intimately linked
(triggered by a strong interaction) but not coincident. The lack of CO emission
towards the QSO itself renews the controversy regarding its host galaxy by
making a gas-rich spiral (the typical host of Narrow Line Seyfert~1 AGNs) less
likely. Finally, given that HE 0450--2958 and similar IR-warm QSOs are
considered typical ULIRG$\to $(optically bright QSO) transition candidates, our
results raise the possibility that some may simply be {\it gas-rich/gas-poor
(e.g. spiral/elliptical) galaxy interactions} which ``activate'' an optically
bright unobscured QSO in the gas-poor galaxy, and a starburst in the gas-rich
one. We argue that such interactions may have gone largely unnoticed even in
the local Universe because the combination of tools necessary to disentagle the
progenitors (high resolution and S/N optical {\it and} CO imaging) became
available only recently.

appropriate. The method is TVD, entropy decreasing, exactly conservative, and
has no numerical dissipation. Difficulties involving transonic points do not
occur, however inflection points of the flux function pose a slight challenge,
which can be overcome by a special treatment. Away from shocks the method is
second order accurate, while shocks are resolved with first order accuracy. A
postprocessing step can recover the second order accuracy. The method is

a pair exciton with J=4 suggests an attractive, sub-dominant, $f$-wave pairing

  exchange-biased spin-valve with insulating antiferromagnetic layer",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other",,"  The impact of in-plane alternating currents on the exchange bias, resistance,
and magnetoresistance of a CoFe/NiCoO/CoFe/Cu/CoFe spin-valve is studied. With
increasing current, the resistance is increased while the maximum
magnetoresistance ratio decreases. Noticeably, the reversal of the pinned layer
is systematically suppressed in both field sweeping directions. Since the NiCoO
oxide is a good insulator, it is expected that the ac current flows only in the
CoFe/Cu/CoFe top layers, thus ruling out any presence of spin-transfer torque
acting on the spins in the antiferromagnetic layer. Instead, our measurements
show clear evidences for the influence of Joule heating caused by the current.
Moreover, results from temperature-dependent measurements very much resemble
those of the current dependence, indicating that the effect of Joule heating
plays a major role in the current-in-plane spin-valve configurations. The
results also suggest that spin-transfer torques between ferromagnetic layers
might still exist and compete with the exchange bias at sufficiently high
currents.

the configuration of the magnetic field and the geometry of the visible
emitting region. Some peculiar behaviors in the X-ray afterglows of {\it Swift}
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), such as energetic flares and the plateau followed by a
sharp drop, might by highly linearly-polarized because the outflows powering
these behaviors may be Poynting-flux dominated. Furthermore, the broken-down of
the symmetry of the visible emitting region may be hiding in current X-ray data
and will give rise to interesting polarization signatures. In this work we
focus on the polarization accompanying the very early sharp decline of GRB
X-ray afterglows. We show that strong polarization evolution is possible in
both the high latitude emission model and the dying central engine model which
are used to interpret this sharp X-ray decline. It is thus not easy to
efficiently probe the physical origin of the very early X-ray sharp decline
with future polarimetry. Strong polarization evolution is also possible in the
decline phase of X-ray flares and in the shallow decline phase of X-ray light
curves characterized by chromatic X-ray VS. Optical breaks. An {\it XRT}-like
detector but with polarization capability on board a {\em Swift}-like satellite
would be suitable to test our predictions.

unified electronic phase diagram (UEPD), where three characteristic
temperatures (T*'s) and their corresponding energies (E*'s) converge as pu
increases in the underdoped regime. T*'s and E*'s merge together with the Tc
curve and 3.5kBTc curve at pu - 1.1 in the overdoped regime, respectively. They
finally go to zero at pu - 1.3. The UEPD follows an asymmetric half-dome-shaped
Tc curve in which Tc appears at pu - 0.4, reaches a maximum at pu - 1, and
rapidly goes to zero at pu - 1.3. The asymmetric half-dome-shaped Tc curve is
at odds with the well-known symmetric superconducting dome for La2-xSrxCuO4
(SrD-La214), in which two characteristic temperatures and energies converge as
pu increases and merge together at pu - 1.6, where Tc goes to zero. The UEPD
clearly shows that pseudogap phase precedes and coexists with high temperature
superconductivity in the underdoped and overdoped regimes, respectively. It is
also clearly seen that the upper limit of high-Tc cuprate physics ends at a
hole concentration that equals to 1.3 times the optimal doping concentration
for almost all high-Tc cuprate materials, and 1.6 times the optimal doping
concentration for the SrD-La214. Our analysis strongly suggests that pseudogap
is a precursor of high-Tc superconductivity, the observed quantum critical
point inside the superconducting dome may be related to the end point of UEPD,
and the normal state of the underdoped and overdoped high temperature
superconductors cannot be regarded as a conventional Fermi liquid phase.

shown that the shortening of the top gate can result in a substantial

  We present a verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) protocol, and a general
secure multiparty quantum computation (MPQC) protocol, which can tolerate any
(n-1)/2 (rounded down) cheaters among n players. Previous protocols for these
tasks tolerated (n-1)/4 (rounded down) and (n-1)/6 (rounded down) cheaters,
respectively. The threshold we achieve is tight - even in the classical case,
``fair'' multiparty computation is not possible if any set of n/2 players can
cheat.
  Our protocols rely on approximate quantum error-correcting codes, which can
tolerate a larger fraction of errors than traditional, exact codes. We
introduce new families of authentication schemes and approximate codes tailored
to the needs of our protocols, as well as new state purification techniques
along the lines of those used in fault-tolerant quantum circuits.

we provide an explicit construction of $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ and
show that it is characterised by a set of parameters, of which concurrence is
but one particular combination. $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ is manifestly
invariant under $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ transformations. It can, in fact,
reconstruct the state up to local operations - with the specification of at
most four additional parameters. Finally the new measure resolves the

enough to account for the acceleration of the scale factor in the FLRW models.
In particular, some simple models of structure formation studied in the
literature seem to indicate that this is indeed possible, and it has also been
suggested that the perturbed FLRW framework is no longer a good approximation
during structure formation, when the density contrast becomes nonlinear. In
this work we attempt to clarify the situation to some extent, using a fully
relativistic model of pressureless spherical collapse. We find that whereas
averaging during structure formation can lead to acceleration via a selective
choice of averaging domains, the acceleration is not present when more generic
domains are used for averaging. Further, we show that for most of the duration
of the collapse, matter velocities remain small, and the perturbed FLRW form of
the metric can be explicitly recovered, in the structure formation phase. We
also discuss the fact that the magnitude of the average effects of
inhomogeneities depends on the scale of averaging, and while it may not be
completely negligible on intermediate scales, it is expected to remain small
when averaging on suitably large scales.

relatively small, faint, and low stellar concentration bulges) can deviate from
the M-sigma relation by delta(log M) = -0.5 to -1.0 dex (in the sense that
their sigma values are too large) and generate much of the aforementioned
correlations. Removal of the seven barred galaxies from the Tremaine et al. set
of 31 galaxies results in a ``barless M-sigma'' relation with an intrinsic
scatter of 0.17 dex (cf. 0.27 dex for the 31 galaxies) and a total scatter of
0.25 dex (cf. 0.34 dex for the 31 galaxies). The introduction of third
parameters does not reduce the scatter of the barless M-sigma relation.
Furthermore, removal of the barred galaxies, or all the disk galaxies, from an
expanded and updated set of 40 galaxies with reliable black hole mass
measurements gives a consistent result, such that log(M_bh/M_sun) =
(8.25+/-0.05) + (3.68+/-0.25)log [sigma/200].
  The ""barless"" sigma-L relation for galaxies with black hole mass measurements
is found to be consistent with that from the SDSS sample of early-type

Einstein radius $Re_1=1.43\pm0.01""$. The wider image separation ($Re_2=2.07\pm

detection in the F814W filter implies zs2<6.9. The configuration can be well

this configuration can be used to constrain cosmological parameters exploiting

halos depend on the density of large-scale environment. It implies that the
galaxy properties like age and size of bulge may also vary with the surrounding
large-scale structures, which are characterized by the tidal shear as well as
the density. By using a sample of 15,882 well-resolved nearby galaxies from the
Tully Catalog and the real space tidal field reconstructed from the 2Mass
Redshift Survey (2MRS), we investigate the dependence of galaxy morphological
type on the shear of large-scale environment where the galaxies are embedded.
We first calculate the large scale dimensionless overdensities (d) and the
large-scale ellipticities (e) of the regions where the Tully galaxies are
located and classify the Tully galaxies according to their morphological types
and create subsamples selected at similar value of d but span different ranges
in e. We calculate the mean ellipticity, <e>, averaged over each subsample and
find a signal of variation of <e> with galaxy morphological type: For the case
of 0.5<=d<=1.0, the ellipticals are found to be preferentially located in the
regions with low ellipticity. For the case of -0.3<=d<=0.1, the latest-type
spirals are found to be preferentially located in the regions with high
ellipticity. The null hypothesis that the mean ellipticities of the regions
where the ellipticals and the latest type spirals are located are same as the
global mean ellipticity averaged over all types is rejected at 3 sigma level
when -0.3<=d<=0.1. Yet, no signal of galaxy-shear correlation is found in the
highly overdense/underdense regions. The observed trend suggests that the
formation epochs of galactic halos might be a function not only of halo mass
and large-scale density but also of large-scale shear.

the obvious question as to how this feature is reconciled with the underlying

with almost equal frequency. Accretion from these discs very rapidly adjusts
the hole's spin parameter to average values $\bar a \sim 0.1-0.3$ (the precise
range depending slightly on the disc vertical viscosity coefficient $\alpha_2$)
from any initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations ($\Delta a\sim
\pm 0.2$) about these. We conclude (a) AGN black holes should on average spin
moderately, with the mean value $\bar a$ decreasing slowly as the mass
increases; (b) SMBH coalescences leave little long--term effect on $\bar a$;
(c) SMBH coalescence products in general have modest recoil velocities, so that
there is little likelihood of their being ejected from the host galaxy; (d)

superconductivity. With external magnetic fields one can modulate the phase in
a long junction and create traveling, solitonic waves of magnetic flux, called
fluxons. Today, it is also possible to device two different types of junctions:
depending on the sign of the critical current density, they are called 0- or
pi-junction. In turn, a 0-pi junction is formed by joining two of such
junctions. As a result, one obtains a pinned Josephson vortex of fractional
magnetic flux, at the 0-pi boundary. Here, we analyze this arrangement of
superconducting junctions in the context of an atomic bosonic quantum gas,
where two-state atoms in a double well trap are coupled in an analogous
fashion. There, an all-optical 0-pi Josephson junction is created by the phase
of a complex valued Rabi-frequency and we a derive a discrete four-mode model
for this situation, which qualitatively resembles a semifluxon.

  Our first main theorem is a lower bound for the degree $i+1$ entry of a
Gorenstein $h$-vector, in terms of its entry in degree $i$. This result carries
interesting applications concerning unimodality: indeed, an important
consequence is that, given $r$ and $i$, all Gorenstein $h$-vectors of
codimension $r$ and socle degree $e\geq e_0=e_0(r,i)$ (this function being

new proof of a theorem of Stanley that all Gorenstein $h$-vectors in
codimension three are unimodal.
  Our second main theorem is an asymptotic formula for the least value that the

$r$, and socle degree, $e$. This theorem broadly generalizes a recent result of
ours, where we proved a conjecture of Stanley predicting that asymptotic value

assuming a short range disorder (Anderson-type). In agreement with localization
scaling theory, the electronic systems are found to undergo a conventional

probabilities of ordinal patterns of order d=2 are monotonically related to the
Hurst parameter H. By plugging the sample relative frequency of those patterns
indicating changes between up and down into the monotonic relation to H, one
obtains the Zero Crossing (ZC) estimator of the Hurst parameter which has found
considerable attention in mathematical and applied research.
  In this paper, we generally discuss the estimation of ordinal pattern
probabilities in fBm. As it turns out, according to the sufficiency principle,
for ordinal patterns of order d=2 any reasonable estimator is an affine
functional of the sample relative frequency of changes. We establish strong
consistency of the estimators and show them to be asymptotically normal for
H<3/4. Further, we derive confidence intervals for the Hurst parameter.
Simulation studies show that the ZC estimator has larger variance but less bias

conjectures in dimension two, as well as their validity for domains
asymptotically close to a disk, and also discuss further links between
$\kappa(\Omega)$ and the eigenvalues of the Laplacians.

smaller than 100 $\mu$m are presented. These calculations, which exploit new
results for the capacitance of ice crystals, are compared with laboratory
studies and found to be in good agreement. The results highlight a weakness in
contemporary ice particle fall speed parameterisations for very small crystals,
which can lead to sedimentation rates being overestimated by a factor of two.
The theoretical approach applied here may also be useful for calculating the
sedimentation rate and mobility of non-spherical aerosol particles.

specialization of the Turaev-Viro invariants of 3-manifolds, that we call
colored Turaev-Viro invariants. Their construction is based on a presentation
of a pair (M,L), where M is a closed oriented 3-manifold and L is an oriented
link in M, by a triangulation of M such that each component of L is an edge. We
analyze some basic properties of these invariants, including the behavior under
connected sums of pairs away and along links. These properties allow us to
provide examples of links in the three-sphere having the same HOMFLY polynomial
and the same Kauffman polynomial but distinct Turaev-Viro invariants, and
similar examples for the Alexander polynomial. We also investigate the
relations between the Turaev-Viro invariants of (M,L) and those of the
complement of L in M, showing that they are sometimes but not always determined
by each other.

  some minor mistakes/typos",,,,"math.RA math.AG",,"  In this note, we initiate the systematic study of the Lie algebra structure
of the necklace Lie algebra n of a free algebra in 2d variables. We begin by
giving a description of n as an sp(2d)-module. Specializing to d = 1, we
decompose n into a direct sum of highest weight modules for sl_2, the
coefficients of which are given by a closed formula. Next, we observe that n
has a nontrivial center, which we link through the center C of the trace ring
of couples of generic 2x2 matrices to the Poisson center of S(sl_2). The Lie
algebra structure of n induces a Poisson structure on C, the symplectic leaves
of which we are able to describe as coadjoint orbits for the Lie group of the
semidirect product sl_2\rtimes h of sl_2 with the Heisenberg Lie algebra h.
Finally, we provide a link between double Poisson algebras on one hand and
Poisson orders on the other hand, showing that all trace rings of a double
Poisson algebra are Poisson orders over their center.

  Large-Scale Transport of Refractory Grains","22 pages, 10 figures. Earth & Planetary Science Letters, accepted",,"10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.008",,"astro-ph",,"  The discovery of refractory grains amongst the particles collected from Comet
81P/Wild 2 by the Stardust spacecraft (Brownlee et al. 2006) provides the
ground truth for large-scale transport of materials formed in high temperature
regions close to the protosun outward to the comet-forming regions of the solar
nebula. While accretion disk models driven by a generic turbulent viscosity
have been invoked as a means to explain such large-scale transport, the
detailed physics behind such an ``alpha'' viscosity remains unclear. We present
here an alternative physical mechanism for large-scale transport in the solar
nebula: gravitational torques associated with the transient spiral arms in a
marginally gravitationally unstable disk, of the type that appears to be
necessary to form gas giant planets. Three dimensional models are presented of
the time evolution of self-gravitating disks, including radiative transfer and
detailed equations of state, showing that small dust grains will be transported
upstream and downstream (with respect to the mean inward flow of gas and dust
being accreted by the central protostar) inside the disk on time scales of less
than 1000 yr inside 10 AU. These models furthermore show that any initial
spatial heterogeneities present (e.g., in short-lived isotopes such as 26Al)
will be homogenized by disk mixing down to a level of ~10%, preserving the use
of short-lived isotopes as accurate nebular chronometers, while simultaneously
allowing for the spread of stable oxygen isotope ratios. This finite level of
nebular spatial heterogeneity appears to be related to the coarse mixing
achieved by spiral arms, with radial widths of order 1 AU, over time scales of
~1000 yrs.

in turbulence. In addition, it addresses a question of direct practical
interest, namely the rate of energy dissipation. Unfortunately, only an upper
bound is obtained as a larger functional space than the space of solutions to
the Navier-Stokes equations is searched. Yet, in general, this upper bound is
in good agreement with experimental results in terms of order of magnitude and
power law of the imposed Reynolds number. In this paper, the variational
approach to turbulence is extended to the case of dynamo action and an upper
bound is obtained for the global dissipation rate (viscous and Ohmic). A simple
plane Couette flow is investigated. For low magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$
fluids, the upper bound of energy dissipation is that of classical turbulence
(i.e. proportional to the cubic power of the shear velocity) for magnetic
Reynolds numbers below $P_m^{-1}$ and follows a steeper evolution for magnetic
Reynolds numbers above $P_m^{-1}$ (i.e. proportional to the shear velocity to
the power four) in the case of electrically insulating walls. However, the
effect of wall conductance is crucial : for a given value of wall conductance,
there is a value for the magnetic Reynolds number above which energy
dissipation cannot be bounded. This limiting magnetic Reynolds number is
inversely proportional to the square root of the conductance of the wall.
Implications in terms of energy dissipation in experimental and natural dynamos
are discussed.
