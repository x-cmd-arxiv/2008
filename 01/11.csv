the 7 keV iron K-shell absorption line (at 7.6 keV in the quasar frame), which
is significantly weaker in 2005 than during the 2001 XMM-Newton observation.
From a recombination timescale of <4 years, this implies an absorber density
n>0.004 particles/cm3, while the absorber column is 5e22<N_H <1 1e24
particles/cm2. Thus the sizescale of the absorber is too compact (pc scale) and
the surface brightness of the dense gas too high (by 9-10 orders of magnitude)
to arise from local hot gas, such as the local bubble, group or Warm/Hot
Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), as suggested by McKernan et al. (2004, 2005).
Instead the iron K-shell absorption must be associated with an AGN outflow with
mildly relativistic velocities. Finally we show that the the association of the
absorption in PG1211+143 with local hot gas is simply a coincidence, the
comparison between the recession and iron K absorber outflow velocities in
other AGN does not reveal a one to one kinematic correlation.

transport equation is derived to explain the transport of cosmic ray protons
within elliptical galaxies. Aims: Cosmic ray transport within elliptical
galaxies is an interesting element in understanding the origin of high
energetic particles measured on Earth. As probable sources of those high
energetic particles, elliptical galaxies show a dense interstellar medium as a
consequence of activity in the galactic nucleus or merging events between
galaxies. Thus it is necessary for an appropriate description of cosmic ray
transport to take the diffusive and convective processes in a dense
interstellar environment into account. Here we show that the transport
equations can be solved analytically with respect to the given geometry and
boundary conditions in position space, as well as in momentum space. Results:
The spatial solution is shown using a generalized source of cosmic rays.
Additionally, the special case of a jet-like source is illustrated. We present
the solution in momentum space with respect to an escape term for cosmic ray
protons depending on the spatial shape of the galaxy. For a delta-shape
injection function, the momentum solution is obtained analytically. We find
that the spectral index measured on Earth can be obtained by appropriately
choosing of the strength of Fermi I and Fermi II processes. From these results
we calculate the gamma-ray flux from pion decay due to proton-proton
interaction to give connection to observations. Additionally we determine the
escape-spectrum of cosmic rays. The results show that both spectra are harder
than the intrinsic power-law spectrum for cosmic rays in elliptical galaxies.

consequence of enhanced dynamical encounter rates in more massive clusters

that weak reactions during this simmering set a maximum electron abundance Ye

various quantum phase transitions corresponding to the onset of superfluidity
at zero temperature of bosons in a quenched random medium. The functional
integral formulation of this problem in d spatial dimensions yields a
(d+1)-dimensional classical XY-model with extended disorder--the so-called
random rod problem. Particle-hole symmetry may then be broken by adding nonzero
site energies. We may distinguish three cases: (i) exact particle-hole
symmetry, in which the site energies all vanish, (ii) statistical particle-hole
symmetry in which the site energy distribution is symmetric about zero,
vanishing on average, and (iii) complete absence of particle-hole symmetry in
which the distribution is generic. We explore in each case the nature of the
excitations in the non-superfluid Mott insulating and Bose glass phases. We
find that the Bose glass compressibility, which has the interpretation of a
temporal spin stiffness or superfluid density, is positive in cases (ii) and
(iii), but that it vanishes with an essential singularity as full particle-hole
symmetry is restored. We then focus on the critical point and discuss the
relevance of type (ii) particle-hole symmetry breaking perturbations to the
random rod critical behavior. We argue that a perturbation of type (iii) is
irrelevant to the resulting type (ii) critical behavior: the statistical
symmetry is restored on large scales close to the critical point, and case (ii)
therefore describes the dirty boson fixed point. To study higher dimensions we
attempt, with partial success, to generalize the Dorogovtsev-Cardy-Boyanovsky
double epsilon expansion technique to this problem. The qualitative
renormalization group flow picture this technique provides is quite compelling.

discover squarks and/or gluinos along all the CMSSM coannihilation strip where
the relic neutralino LSP density lies within the range favoured for cold dark

state (EOS) of neutron-rich stellar matter. While the collective flow and
particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have constrained
tightly the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter up to about five times the normal
nuclear matter density, the more recent experimental data on isospin-diffusion
and isoscaling in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies have
constrained considerably the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy
at subsaturation densities. Although there are still many uncertainties and
challenges to pin down completely the EOS of neutron-rich nuclear matter, the
heavy-ion reaction experiments in terrestrial laboratories have limited the EOS
of neutron-rich nuclear matter in a range much narrower than that spanned by
various EOSs currently used in astrophysical studies in the literature. These
nuclear physics constraints could thus provide more reliable information about
properties of neutron stars. Within well established formalisms using the
nuclear constrained EOSs we study the momenta of inertia of neutron stars. We

class of finite and infinite words that are 'rich' in palindromes in the utmost
sense. A characteristic property of so-called ""rich words"" is that all complete
returns to any palindromic factor are themselves palindromes. These words
encompass the well-known episturmian words, originally introduced by the second
author together with X. Droubay and G. Pirillo in 2001. Other examples of rich
words have appeared in many different contexts. Here we present the first
unified approach to the study of this intriguing family of words.
  Amongst our main results, we give an explicit description of the periodic
rich infinite words and show that the recurrent balanced rich infinite words
coincide with the balanced episturmian words. We also consider two wider
classes of infinite words, namely ""weakly rich words"" and almost rich words
(both strictly contain all rich words, but neither one is contained in the
other). In particular, we classify all recurrent balanced weakly rich words. As
a consequence, we show that any such word on at least three letters is
necessarily episturmian; hence weakly rich words obey Fraenkel's conjecture.
Likewise, we prove that a certain class of almost rich words obeys Fraenkel's
conjecture by showing that the recurrent balanced ones are episturmian or
contain at least two distinct letters with the same frequency.
  Lastly, we study the action of morphisms on (almost) rich words with
particular interest in morphisms that preserve (almost) richness. Such
morphisms belong to the class of ""P-morphisms"" that was introduced by A. Hof,
O. Knill, and B. Simon in 1995.

  evolutionary naming game model","paper withdrawn, much revised version is under preparation",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CL cs.MA",,"  Computational modelling with multi-agent systems is becoming an important
technique of studying language evolution. We present a brief introduction into
this rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an
analysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating
agents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an
evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and
linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of
the model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically
unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with
large learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds
via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language
and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the
increase of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity
increases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several
transition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets
an additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting
the evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and
biological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect
certainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species.

smooth emission, usually dominant in X-rays and sometimes in the optical. When
Gamma of the late shells is larger than 1/theta_j, where theta_j is the jet
opening angle, we see only a portion of the emitting surface. Eventually, Gamma
becomes smaller than 1/theta_j, and the entire emitting surface is visible.
When Gamma=1/theta_j there is a break in the light curve, and the plateau ends.
During the plateau phase, we see the sum of the ""late-prompt"" emission (due to
late internal dissipation), and the ""real afterglow"" emission (due to external
shocks). A variety of different optical and X-ray light curves is possible,
explaining why the X-ray and the optical light curves often do not track each
other, and why they often do not have simultaneous breaks.

very small small (<1A), but it has a profound effect on ferroelectric

excitation sequence observed in nearby H II regions and SDSS emission-line
galaxies. In order to fully understand the causes of this offset, which is also
observed in z~2 star-forming galaxies, we examine in detail the small fraction
of SDSS galaxies that have similar diagnostic ratios to those of the DEEP2
sample. Some of these galaxies indicate evidence for AGN and/or shock activity,
which may give rise to their unusual line ratios, and contribute to Balmer
emission lines at the level of ~20%. Others indicate no evidence for AGN or
shock excitation, yet are characterized by higher electron densities and
temperatures, and therefore, interstellar gas pressures, than typical SDSS
star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass. These anomalous objects also
have higher concentrations and star-formation rate surface densities, which are
directly connected to higher interstellar pressure. Higher star-formation rate
surface densities, interstellar pressures, and HII region ionization parameters
may also be common at high-redshift. These effects must be taken into account
when using strong-line indicators to understand the evolution of heavy elements

relation out to z~2 is more significant than previous estimates. (abridged)

convection to build global-scale flows of differential rotation and meridional
circulation. Our sun must have rotated more rapidly in its past, as is
suggested by observations of many rapidly rotating young solar-type stars. Here
we explore the effects of more rapid rotation on the patterns of convection in
such stars and the global-scale flows which are self-consistently established.
The convection in these systems is richly time dependent and in our most
rapidly rotating suns a striking pattern of spatially localized convection
emerges. Convection near the equator in these systems is dominated by one or
two patches of locally enhanced convection, with nearly quiescent streaming
flow in between at the highest rotation rates. These active nests of convection
maintain a strong differential rotation despite their small size. The structure
of differential rotation is similar in all of our more rapidly rotating suns,
with fast equators and slower poles. We find that the total shear in
differential rotation, as measured by latitudinal angular velocity contrast,
Delta_Omega, increases with more rapid rotation while the relative shear,
Delta_Omega/Omega, decreases. In contrast, at more rapid rotation the
meridional circulations decrease in both energy and peak velocities and break
into multiple cells of circulation in both radius and latitude.

to which the stars in more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter
period than those in less massive galaxies. We show that this could be the
natural result of a shutdown of star formation in dark matter haloes above a
critical mass of 10^12MSun. This is demonstrated using a semianalytic
simulation of galaxy formation within the standard hierarchical scenario of
structure formation. The assumed threshold mass is motivated by the prediction
of stable shock heating above this mass and the finding that such a shutdown
reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in luminosity and colour.The
shutdown at a critical halo mass introduces a characteristic stellar mass for
the transition of galaxies into the `red sequence' of the galaxy
colour-magnitude diagram. Central galaxies of haloes that are more massive
today have reached this mass earlier and can therefore grow further along the
red sequence by dry mergers, ending up more massive and containing older stars.
Small galaxies formed in haloes below the critical mass can shutdown late, when
they fall into haloes above the critical mass and become satellites. While our
semianalytic simulation that incorporates an explicit shutdown reproduces
downsizing as inferred from the stellar ages of ellipticals, we explain why it
is much harder to detect downsizing using the mass functions of different
galaxy types.

The models succeed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others.
A notable success is that the Bower et al. model provides a good match to the
observed LF at z~3. However, all models predict an increase with time of the
rest-frame V-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease.
The models also have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of
galaxies. In all models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases
sharply from z~3 to z~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the
observations. Conversely, in the models the luminosity density of blue galaxies
is approximately constant, whereas it decreases in the observations. These
discrepancies cannot be entirely remedied by changing the treatment of dust and

interpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high redshift

produced in the expanding atmospheres of Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, should be
detectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5AA in the integrated spectra of
star-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about half
solar. Our models reproduce the strength of the He II 1640 line measured in the
spectra of Lyman break galaxies for established values of their metallicities.
With better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature has
the potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, as
well as low, redshifts.
  We also uncover a relationship in SDSS galaxies between their location in the
[O III]/Hb vs. [N II]/Ha diagnostic diagram (the BPT diagram) and their excess
specific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. We infer
that an elevated ionisation parameter U is at the root of this effect, and
propose that this is also the cause of the offset of high redshift star-forming
galaxies in the BPT diagram compared to local ones. We further speculate that
higher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionising photons may
be the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of U in the H
II regions of high redshift galaxies. The impact of such differences on
abundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found to
be relatively minor.

full mass reconstruction is possible for the B, we still find that the
same-sign dilepton channel offers the best chances of discovery compared to
other previous searches that used final states with one or two opposite-sign

catalogue Bulge and spiral arms to find Galactic RCB stars. The light curves of
$\sim$100 million stars, monitored for 6.7 years (from July 1996 to February

and rapid drops in luminosity. Follow-up spectroscopy has been used to confirm
the photometric candidates. We have discovered 14 new RCB stars, all in the
direction of the Galactic Bulge, bringing the total number of confirmed
Galactic RCB stars to about 51. After reddening correction, the colours and
absolute magnitudes of at least 9 of the stars are similar to those of
Magellanic RCB stars. This suggests that these stars are in fact located in the
Galactic Bulge, making them the first RCB stars discovered in the Bulge. The
localisation of the 5 remaining RCBs is more uncertain: 4 are either located
behind the Bulge at an estimated maximum distance of 14 kpc or have an unusual
thick circumstellar shell; the other is a DY Per RCB which may be located in
the Bulge, even if it is fainter than the known Magellanic DY Per. From the
small scale height found using the 9 new Bulge RCBs, $61<h^{RCB}_{Bulge}<246$

finding the numerical solution of the regional model consists in formulating
and solving the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. The related boundary conditions are
obtained by linear interpolation of data available on a coarse grid (global
data), to the boundary of regional model. Errors, in boundary conditions,
appearing owing to linear interpolation may lead to increasing errors in
numerical solution during integration. The methods developed to reduce these
errors deal with continuous dynamic assimilation of known global data available
inside the regional domain. Essentially, this assimilation procedure performs a
nudging of large-scale component of regional model solution to large-scale
global data component by introducing the relaxation forcing terms into the
regional model equations. As a result, the obtained solution is not a valid
numerical solution of the original regional model. In this work we propose the
optimization approach which is free from the above-mentioned shortcoming. The
formulation of the joint problem of finding the regional model solution and
data assimilation, as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, gives the
possibility to obtain the exact numerical solution of the regional model. Three
simple model examples (ODE Burgers equation, Rossby-Oboukhov equation,
Korteweg-de Vries equation) were considered in this paper. The result of
performed numerical experiments indicates that the optimization approach can
significantly improve the precision of the sought numerical solution, even in
the cases in which the solution of Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is very sensitive
to the errors in the boundary condition.

more rapidly than the current solar rate. Observations generally indicate that
more rapid rotation is correlated with stronger magnetic activity and perhaps
more effective dynamo action. Here we examine the effects of more rapid
rotation on dynamo action in a star like our sun. We find that vigorous dynamo
action is realized, with magnetic field generated throughout the bulk of the
convection zone. These simulations do not possess a penetrative tachocline of
shear where global-scale fields are thought to be organized in our sun, but
despite this we find strikingly ordered fields, much like sea-snakes of
toroidal field, which are organized on global scales. We believe this to be a

programs, for a shared memory model with common hardware-available primitives
such as atomic registers, compare-and-swap, load-linked/store conditional, etc.
The programs we synthesize are dynamic: new processes can be created and added
at run-time, and so our programs are not finite-state, in general.
Nevertheless, we successfully exploit automatic synthesis and model-checking
methods based on propositional temporal logic. Our method is algorithmically
efficient, with complexity polynomial in the number of component processes (of
the program) that are ``alive'' at any time. Our method does not explicitly
construct the automata-theoretic product of all processes that are alive,
thereby avoiding \intr{state explosion}. Instead, for each pair of processes
which interact, our method constructs an automata-theoretic product
(\intr{pair-machine}) which embodies all the possible interactions of these two
processes. From each pair-machine, we can synthesize a correct
\intr{pair-program} which coordinates the two involved processes as needed. We
allow such pair-programs to be added dynamically at run-time. They are then
``composed conjunctively'' with the currently alive pair-programs to
re-synthesize the program as it results after addition of the new pair-program.
We are thus able to add new behaviors, which result in new properties being
satisfied, at run-time. We establish a ``large model'' theorem which shows that
the synthesized large program inherits correctness properties from the
pair-programs.

intrinsic narrow UV absorption lines (intrinsic NALs) to carry out an
exploratory survey of their X-ray properties. Our sample consists of three
intrinsic-NAL quasars and one ""mini-BAL"" quasar, plus four quasars without
intrinsic absorption lines for comparison. These were drawn in a systematic
manner from an optical/UV-selected sample. The X-ray properties of
intrinsic-NAL quasars are indistinguishable from those of ""normal"" quasars. We
do not find any excess absorption in quasars with intrinsic NALs, with upper
limits of a few times 10^22 cm^-2. We compare the X-ray and UV properties of
our sample quasars by plotting the equivalent width and blueshift velocity of
the intrinsic NALs and the X-ray spectral index against the ""optical-to-X-ray""
slope, alpha-ox. When BAL quasars and other AGNs with intrinsic NALs are
included, the plots suggest that intrinsic-NAL quasars form an extension of the
BAL sequences and tend to bridge the gap between BAL and ""normal"" quasars.
Observations of larger samples of intrinsic-NAL quasars are needed to verify
these conclusions. We also test two competing scenarios for the location of the
NAL gas in an accretion-disk wind. Our results strongly support a location of
the NAL gas at high latitudes above the disk, closer to the disk axis than the
dense BAL wind. We detect excess X-ray absorption only in Q0014+8118, which
does not host intrinsic NALs. The absorbing medium very likely corresponds to
an intervening system at z=1.1, which also produces strong absorption lines in
the rest-frame UV spectrum of this quasar. In the appendix we discuss the
connection between UV and X-ray attenuation and its effect on alpha-ox.

structure theorems for more complex notions of exchangeability by Aldous
[1,2,3], Hoover [41,42], Kallenberg [44] and Kingman [47]. On the other hand,
such exchangeable laws were first related to questions from combinatorics in an
independent analysis by Fremlin and Talagrand [29], and again more recently in
Tao [62], where they appear as a natural proxy for the `leading order
statistics' of colourings of large graphs or hypergraphs. Moreover, this
relation appears implicitly in the study of various more bespoke formalisms for
handling `limit objects' of sequences of dense graphs or hypergraphs in a
number of recent works, including Lov\'{a}sz and Szegedy [52], Borgs, Chayes,
Lov\'{a}sz, S\'{o}s, Szegedy and Vesztergombi [17], Elek and Szegedy [24] and
Razborov [54,55]. However, the connection between these works and the earlier
probabilistic structural results seems to have gone largely unappreciated. In
this survey we recall the basic results of the theory of exchangeable laws, and
then explain the probabilistic versions of various interesting questions from
graph and hypergraph theory that their connection motivates (particularly
extremal questions on the testability of properties for graphs and
hypergraphs). We also locate the notions of exchangeability of interest to us
in the context of other classes of probability measures subject to various
symmetries, in particular contrasting the methods employed to analyze
exchangeable laws with related structural results in ergodic theory, particular
the Furstenberg-Zimmer structure theorem for probability-preserving $\mathbb
{Z}$-systems, which underpins Furstenberg's ergodic-theoretic proof of
Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem. The forthcoming paper [10]--hereditarytest will make a
much more elaborate appeal to the link between exchangeable laws and dense

The data include imaging and spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope,
supplemented by groundbased near-infrared imaging. We confirm a strong
correlation of aromatic emission with metallicity, with a threshold at a
metallicity [12+log(O/H)]~8. The large scatter in both the metallicity and
radiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to a
single effect, but to some combination. We show that the far-infrared color
temperature of the large dust grains increases towards lower metallicity,
peaking at a metallicity of 8 before turning over. We compute dust masses and
compare them to HI masses from the literature to derive the gas to dust ratio,
which increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude between solar metallicity and a
metallicity of 8, below which it flattens out. The abrupt change in aromatic
emission at mid-infrared wavelengths thus appears to be reflected in the
far-infrared properties, indicating that metallicity changes affect the
composition of the full range of dust grain sizes that dominate the infrared
emission. In addition, we find that the ratio L(8 micron)/L(TIR), important for
calibrating 24 micron measurements of high redshift galaxies, increases
slightly as the metallicity decreases from ~solar to ~50% of solar, and then
decreases by an order of magnitude with further decreases in metallicity.

described above, there are three exceptions, SBS 0335-052E, Haro 11, and SHOC

some prototype examples, whether the true values of physical quantities can be
recovered resumming the NS-NS tadpoles, hence by an approach that is related to
the analysis based on String Field Theory by open-closed duality. We show that,
indeed, the positive classical vacuum energy of a Dp-brane of the bosonic
string is exactly canceled by the negative contribution arising from tree-level
tadpole resummation, in complete agreement with Sen's conjecture on open-string
tachyon condensation and with the consequent analysis based on String Field
Theory. We also show that the vanishing classical vacuum energy of the SO(8192)
unoriented bosonic open-string theory does not receive any tree-level
corrections from the tadpole resummation. This result is consistent with the
fact that this (unstable) configuration is free from tadpoles of massless
closed-string modes, although there is a tadpole of the closed string tachyon.
The application of this method to superstring models with broken supersymmetry

rate-distortion function (RDF) subject to the constraint that the distortion is
uncorrelated to the source. This result is based on shaped dithered lattice
quantization in the limit as the lattice dimension tends to infinity and holds
for all positive distortions. It turns out that this uncorrelated distortion
RDF can be realized causally. This feature, which stands in contrast to
Shannon's RDF, is illustrated by causal transform coding. Moreover, we prove
that by using feedback noise shaping the uncorrelated distortion RDF can be
achieved causally and with memoryless entropy coding. Whilst achievability
relies upon infinite dimensional quantizers, we prove that the rate loss
incurred in the finite dimensional case can be upper-bounded by the space
filling loss of the quantizer and, thus, is at most 0.254 bit/dimension.

leads to interesting phenomena such as the bunching of outcomes in the electron

The nuclear spin system is also affected by the quantum correlation and is in
fact squeezed via conditional measurements or postselection. This squeezing is
confirmed by calculating the increase in the purity of the nuclear spin system.
Thus the successive electron spin measurements provide a probabilistic method
to squeeze the nuclear spin system. These new features are predicted not only

of an In adatom deposited on 1.75 monolayers (ML) InAs, forming a wetting layer
on GaAs$(001)$ with the $\alpha_2 (2\times4)$ or $\beta_2 (2\times4)$

studied: we determine the equilibrium geometry of the surfaces and their
stability for various growth conditions. We have then carried out a detailed
study of the potential energy surface (PES) for an In adsorbate, finding the
minima and the saddle points. The main characteristics of the PES and the
bonding configurations of the In adatom on the surface are analyzed by
comparing with analogous studies reported in the literature, trying to extract
the effects due to: (i) the compressive strain to which the InAs adlayer is
subjected, (ii) the particular surface reconstruction, and (iii) the wetting
layer composition. We found that, in general, stable adsorption sites are
located at: (i) locations besides the As in-dimers, (ii) positions bridging two
As in-dimers, (iii) between two adjacent ad-dimers (only in $\beta_2$), and
(iv) locations bridging two As ad-dimers. We find also other shallower
adsorption sites which are more reconstruction specific due to the lower
symmetry of the $\alpha_2$ reconstruction compared to the $\beta_2$
reconstruction.

X-ray observatories. In the present spin-down era of this source, the QPO
central frequency is found to be decreasing. In the earlier spin-up era of this
source, there are only two reports of QPO detections, in 1983 with EXOSAT and
1988 with GINGA with an increasing trend. The QPO frequency evolution in 4U
1626--67 during the last 22 years changed from a positive to a negative trend,
somewhat coincident with the torque reversal in this source. In the accretion
powered X-ray pulsars, the QPO frequency is directly related to the inner
radius of the accretion disk, as per Keplerian Frequency Model (KFM) and Beat
Frequency Model (BFM). A gradual depletion of accretion disk is reported
earlier from the X-ray spectral, flux and pulse profile measurements. The
present QPO frequency evolution study shows that X-ray flux and mass accretion
rate may not change by the same factor, hence the simple KFM and BFM are not
able to explain the QPO evolution in this source. This is the only X-ray pulsar
to show persistent QPOs and is also the first accreting X-ray pulsar in which
the QPO history is reported for a long time scale relating it with the long

Ly alpha forest. Our sample consists of 17 bright quasars in the redshift range
2.7<z<4.1. Analysing the spectra with the flux transmission technique, we
detect the proximity effect in the sample at high significance. We use this to
estimate the average intensity of the metagalactic UV background, assuming it
to be constant over this redshift range. We obtain a value of J =
(9+-4)x10^{-22}ergcm^{-2}s^{-1}Hz^{-1}sr^{-1}, in good agreement with previous
measurements at similar z. We then apply the same procedure to individual lines
of sight, finding a significant deficit in the effective optical depth close to
the emission redshift in every single object except one (which by a different
line of evidence does nevertheless show a noticeable proximity effect). Thus,
we clearly see the proximity effect as a universal phenomenon associated with
individual quasars. Using extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify the
error budget, we assess the expected statistical scatter in the strength of the
proximity effect due to shot noise (cosmic variance). The observed scatter is
larger than the predicted one, so that additional sources of scatter are
required. We rule out a dispersion of spectral slopes as a significant
contributor. Possible effects are long time-scale variability of the quasars
and/or gravitational clustering of Ly alpha forest lines. We speculate on the
possibility of using the proximity effect as a tool to constrain individual
quasar ages, finding that ages between ~10^6 and ~10^8 yrs might produce a
characteristic signature in the optical depth profile towards the QSO. We
identify one possible candidate for this effect in our sample.

spectral line emission. Results: While the continuum emission in NGC6334I
mainly traces the UCHII region, toward NGC6334I(N) we detect line emission from
four of the previously identified dust continuum condensations that are of
protostellar or pre-stellar nature. The CH3CN(5_K-4_K) lines are detected in
all K-components up to energies of 128K above ground toward two protostellar
condensations in both regions. We find line-width increasing with increasing K
for all sources, which indicates a higher degree of internal motions closer to
the central protostars. Toward the main mm and CH3CN source in NGC6334I we
identify a velocity gradient approximately perpendicular to the large-scale
molecular outflow. This may be interpreted as a signature of an accretion disk,
although other scenarios, e.g., an unresolved double source, could produce a
similar signature as well. No comparable signature is found toward any of the
other sources. HCN does not trace the dense gas well but it is dominated by the
molecular outflows. While the outflow in NGC6334I exhibits a normal Hubble-law
like velocity structure, the data indicate a precessing outflow close to the
plane of the sky for NGC6334I(N). Furthermore, we observe a wide (~15.4km/s)

regularization of the usual Gauss-Seidel method to minimize $L$. We work in a
nonconvex setting, just assuming that the function $L$ satisfies the Kurdyka-\L

the study of the convergence rate of the algorithm, which depends on the
geometrical properties of the function $L$ around its critical points. When
specialized to $Q(x,y)=|x-y|^2$ and to $f$, $g$ indicator functions, the
algorithm is an alternating projection mehod (a variant of Von Neumann's) that
converges for a wide class of sets including semialgebraic and tame sets,

  the Painlev\'{e} Series","16 pages, 0 figures",,"10.1070/RD2004v009n03ABEH000286",,"nlin.SI",,"  The Painlev\'{e} and weak Painlev\'{e} conjectures have been used widely to
identify new integrable nonlinear dynamical systems. For a system which passes
the Painlev\'{e} test, the calculation of the integrals relies on a variety of
methods which are independent from Painlev\'{e} analysis. The present paper
proposes an explicit algorithm to build first integrals of a dynamical system,
expressed as `quasi-polynomial' functions, from the information provided solely
by the Painlev\'{e} - Laurent series solutions of a system of ODEs.
Restrictions on the number and form of quasi-monomial terms appearing in a
quasi-polynomial integral are obtained by an application of a theorem by
Yoshida (1983). The integrals are obtained by a proper balancing of the
coefficients in a quasi-polynomial function selected as initial ansatz for the
integral, so that all dependence on powers of the time $\tau=t-t_0$ is
eliminated. Both right and left Painlev\'{e} series are useful in the method.
Alternatively, the method can be used to show the non-existence of a
quasi-polynomial first integral. Examples from specific dynamical systems are
given.

model via 2 jets plus missing transverse momentum signatures at the LHC. We
make predictions for both the signal and the dominant Zjj and Wjj backgrounds,
where we introduce missing P_T-dependent jet selection cuts that ensure the
smallness of the 2-jet rate over the 1-jet rate. With the same jet selection
cuts, the distributions of the two jets and their correlation with the missing
transverse momentum provide additional evidence for the production of an
invisible massive object.

enabled us to identify several new multiple image candidates in the cluster,
including a 5 image system with a central image. The multiple images allow us
to construct an accurate 2-dimensional mass map of the central part of the
cluster. The modelling of the cluster mass includes the most prominent cluster
galaxies modelled as truncated isothermal spheres and a smooth halo component
that is described with 2 parametric profiles. The mass reconstruction is done
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that provides us with a total projected
mass density as well as estimates for the parameters of interest and their
respective errors. The mass profile is in reasonable agreement with previous
mass estimates based on the X-ray emission from the hot intra-cluster gas,
however the X-ray mass estimates are systematically lower than what we obtain
with gravitational lensing.

factors. The gluon radiative corrections to the twist-2 and twist-3 terms in
the correlation functions are calculated. The $\bar{MS}$ $b$-quark mass is
employed, instead of the one-loop pole mass used in the previous analyses. The
light-cone sum rule for $f^+_{B\pi}(q^2)$ is fitted to the measured
$q^2$-distribution in $B\to \pi l \nu_l$, fixing the input parameters with the
largest uncertainty: the Gegenbauer moments of the pion distribution amplitude.
For the $B\to \pi$ vector form factor at zero momentum transfer we predict
$f^+_{B\pi}(0)= 0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$. Combining it with the value of the
product $|V_{ub}f^+_{B\pi}(0)|$ extracted from experiment, we obtain
$|V_{ub}|=(3.5\pm 0.4\pm 0.2\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-3}$. In addition, the scalar
and penguin $B\to \pi$ form factors $f^0_{B\pi}(q^2)$ and $f^T_{B\pi}(q^2)$ are
calculated.
