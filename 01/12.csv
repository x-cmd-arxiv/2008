applications such as fluid flow, heat transfer, solid deformation,
electromagnetic waves, and others. In this paper we propose the new numerical
method to solve a class of initial-boundary value problems for the PDEs using
one of the known space discrete numerical schemes and a Taylor series expansion
by time. Normally a second order discretization by space is applied while a
first order by time is satisfactory. Nevertheless, in a number of different
problems, discretization both by temporal and by spatial variables is needed of
highest orders, which complicates numerical solution, in some cases
dramatically. Therefore it is difficult to apply the same numerical methods for
the solution of some PDE arrays if their parameters are varying in a wide range
so that in some of them different numerical schemes by time fit the best for
precise numerical solution. The Taylor series based solution strategy for the
non-stationary PDEs in CFD simulations has been proposed here that attempts to
optimise the computation time and fidelity of the numerical solution.

non-transitive interactions have been found to induce self-organization of
static individuals into noisy, irregular clusters. However, a profound
understanding and characterization of such patterns is still lacking. Here, we
theoretically investigate the influence of individuals' mobility on the spatial
structures emerging in rock-paper-scissors games. We devise a quantitative
approach to analyze the spatial patterns self-forming in the course of the
stochastic time evolution. For a paradigmatic model originally introduced by
May and Leonard, within an interacting particle approach, we demonstrate that
the system's behavior - in the proper continuum limit - is aptly captured by a
set of stochastic partial differential equations. The system's stochastic
dynamics is shown to lead to the emergence of entangled rotating spiral waves.
While the spirals' wavelength and spreading velocity is demonstrated to be
accurately predicted by a (deterministic) complex Ginzburg-Landau equation,
their entanglement results from the inherent stochastic nature of the
system.These findings and our methods have important applications for
understanding the formation of noisy patterns, e.g., in ecological and
evolutionary contexts, and are also of relevance for the kinetics of

offered through an example of non-Newtonian slow liquid movements. The

revisited. Adherence conditions are required except at the contact line.
Consequently, for each fluid, the velocity field is multivalued at the contact

viscous dissipation remain bounded. A Young-Dupr\'e equation for the apparent
dynamic contact angle between the interface and solid surface depending on the

where $p_{F}$ is the Fermi momentum, and $a$ the scattering length. Thus, for a
large mass ratio $M/m$ the conventional perturbation theory requires
significantly smaller Fermi momenta (densities) or scattering lengths than in
the case of $M\sim m$, where the small parameter is $(p_{F}|a|)/\hbar)\ll1$. We
show that 3-body scattering resonances appearing at a large mass ratio due to
the presence of 3-body bound Efimov states do not influence the result, which
in this sense becomes universal.

redshift (z<1) by cross-correlating them with LRGs in the same spatial volume,
hence breaking the degeneracy between QSO luminosity and redshift. We use three
QSO samples from 2SLAQ, 2QZ and SDSS covering a QSO absolute magnitude range,
-24.5<M_{b_J}<-21.5, and cross-correlate them with 2SLAQ (z~0.5) and AAOmega
(z~0.7) photometric and spectroscopic LRGs in the same redshift ranges. The 2-D
and 3-D cross-clustering measurements are generally in good agreement. Our
(2SLAQ) QSO-LRG clustering amplitude (r_0=6.8_{-0.3}^{+0.1}h^{-1}Mpc) as
measured from the semi-projected cross-correlation function appears similar to
the (2SLAQ) LRG-LRG auto-correlation amplitude (r_0=7.45\pm0.35h^{-1}Mpc) and
both are higher than the (2QZ+2SLAQ) QSO-QSO amplitude (r_0\simeq5.0h^{-1}Mpc).
Our measurements show remarkably little QSO-LRG cross-clustering dependence on
QSO luminosity. If anything, the results imply that brighter QSOs may be less
highly biased than faint QSOs, the opposite direction expected from simple high
peaks biasing models. Assuming a standard LCDM model and values for b_{LRG}
measured from LRG autocorrelation analyses, we find b_Q=1.45\pm0.11 at
M_{b_J}\approx-24 and b_Q=1.90\pm0.16 at M_{b_J}~-22. We also find consistent
results for the QSO bias from a z-space distortion analysis of the QSO-LRG
cross-clustering at z~0.55. The dynamical infall results give \beta
_Q=0.55\pm0.10, implying b_Q=1.4\pm0.2. Thus both the z-space distortion and
the amplitude analyses yield b_Q~1.5 at M_{b_J}~-23. The implied DM halo mass
inhabited by QSOs at z~0.55 is \sim10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\sun}, again approximately
independent of QSO luminosity.

Instead we find that the data agrees much better with a model where the

magneto-hydrodynamic jet model, recently developed by Li et al. (2006) and
Nakamura et al. (2006). We conduct complex Monte-Carlo simulations of the

cavity sample's characteristics. We find that the current-dominated model
agrees within 1sigma, whereas the other models can be excluded at >5sigma
confidence. To bring hydrodynamic models into better agreement, cavities would
have to be continuously inflated. However, these assessments are dependent on
our correct understanding of the detectability of cavities in X-ray

rise to a strong magnetoresistance, which decreases sharply with temperature.
The temperature ($T$) dependence of the resistance is due to spin disorder

constraint on the mean stellar density that can be derived directly from the
light curve. The main contributions of this work are 1) a critical compilation

evidence for a new pattern within the scatter about this correlation: planets
around metal-poor stars are more massive than those around metal-rich stars at
a given orbital period. Likewise, we confirm the proposed dichotomy of planets
according to their Safronov number, and we find evidence that the systems with
small Safronov numbers are more metal-rich on average. Finally, we confirm the
trend that led to the suggestion that higher-metallicity stars harbor planets

selection method appears to be a straightforward and efficient way of finding
distant, IR-luminous, star-forming galaxies in narrow redshift ranges. There is
however evidence that the mid-IR spectra of our sample differ systematically
from those of local ULIRGs; our sample have comparable PAH equivalent widths

6.2um/7.7um and 6.2um/11.2um flux ratios. Furthermore, the composite mid-IR

shown that the red fraction of satellite galaxies increases with stellar mass.
Semi-analytical models, however, predict red satellite fractions that are
independent of stellar mass, and much higher than observed. It has been argued
that this discrepancy owes to the fact that the models assume that satellite
galaxies are instantaneously stripped of their hot gas reservoirs at the moment
they are accreted into a bigger halo. In this letter we show that the fraction
of red satellites can be brought in better agreement with the data by simply
decreasing this stripping efficiency. However, this also results in a red
fraction of massive centrals that is much too low. This owes to the fact that
the massive centrals now accrete satellite galaxies that are bluer and more
gas-rich. However, if a significant fraction of low mass satellite galaxies is
tidally disrupted before being accreted by their central host galaxy, as
suggested by recent studies, the red fractions of both centrals and satellites
can be reproduced reasonably well. A problem remains with the red fraction of
centrals of intermediate mass, which is likely to reflect an oversimplified
treatment of AGN feedback.

experiment and theory. Throughout the Li 1s near-edge region, both experiment

between the near-edge spectra for the Li 1s and N 1s initial states. We argue
that both spectra are sampling essentially the same final density of states due
to the combination of long core-hole lifetimes, long photoelectron lifetimes,
and the fact that orbital angular momentum is the same for all relevant initial
states. Such considerations may be generically applicable for low atomic number

metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show
that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the
shape and y-intercept(12+log(O/H)) of the MZ relation. The absolute metallicity
scale (y-int) varies up to 0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the
change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to
use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different
luminosity-metallicity or mass-metallicity relations. We present new
metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using
different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base
calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different
samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for
which different suites of emission-lines are available.Our new conversions
successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity
calibrations, and we reach agreement in the MZ relation to within 0.03 dex on
average. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible
effect on the SDSS MZ relation. We compare the SDSS MZ relation with nuclear
and global relations from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). The turn over
of the MZ relation depends on aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower

samples of well resolved haloes in dynamical equilibrium and we analyse their

Navarro, Frenk & White profile in which the central logarithmic slope $\alpha$
is allowed to vary while preserving the $r^{-3}$ asymptotic form at large
radii, we obtain preferred central slopes for haloes in each of our models.
There is a strong correlation between $\alpha$ and $n$, such that $\alpha$
becomes shallower as $n$ becomes steeper. However, if we normalise our mass
profiles by $r_{-2}$, the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the density

between extrasolar Earth-like planets with surface oceans and those without
using the shape of phase light curves in the visible and near-IR spectrum. We
model the visible light curves of planets having Earth-like surfaces, seasons,
and optically-thin atmospheres with idealized diffuse-scattering clouds. We
show that planets partially covered by water will appear measurably brighter
near crescent phase (relative to Lambertian planets) because of the efficient
specular reflection (i.e., glint) of starlight incident on their surfaces at a
highly oblique angle. Planets on orbits within 30 degrees of edge-on
orientation (half of all planets) will show pronounced glint over a sizeable
range of orbital longitudes, from quadrature to crescent, all outside the glare
of their parent stars. Also, water-covered planets will appear darker than a
Lambertian disk near full illumination. Finally, we show that planets with a
mixed land/water surface will polarize the reflected signal by as much as 30-70
percent. These results suggest several new ways of directly identifying water
on distant planets.

significant population of high-redshift z~2 dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with

for selecting this high-z population based solely on the ratio of the observed

Field, we uncover ~2,600 DOG candidates (= 0.089/sq.arcmin) with 24um flux
densities F24>0.3mJy and (R-[24])>14 (i.e., F[24]/F[R] > 1000). These galaxies
have no counterparts in the local universe, and become a larger fraction of the
population at fainter F24, representing 13% of the sources at 0.3~mJy. DOGs
exhibit evidence of both star-formation and AGN activity, with the brighter
24um sources being more AGN- dominated. We have measured spectroscopic
redshifts for 86 DOGs, and find a broad z distribution centered at <z>~2.0.
Their space density is 2.82E-5 per cubic Mpc, similar to that of bright
sub-mm-selected galaxies at z~2. These redshifts imply very large luminosities
LIR>~1E12-14 Lsun. DOGs contribute ~45-100% of the IR luminosity density
contributed by all z~2 ULIRGs, suggesting that our simple selection criterion
identifies the bulk of z~2 ULIRGs. DOGs may be the progenitors of ~4L*
present-day galaxies seen undergoing a luminous,short- lived phase of bulge and
black hole growth. They may represent a brief evolution phase between SMGs and

spectra are very hard, with their spectral peak energies being above the BATSE
LAD passband limit of $\sim$2 MeV. In such cases, their high-energy spectral
parameters (peak energy and high-energy power-law indices) cannot be adequately
constrained by BATSE LAD data alone. A few dozen bright BATSE GRBs were also
observed with EGRET's calorimeter, TASC, in multi-MeV energy band, with a large
effective area and fine energy resolution. Combining the BATSE and TASC data,
therefore, affords spectra that span four decades of energy ($30 $keV$-200
$MeV), allowing for a broadband spectral analysis with good statistics.
Studying such broadband high-energy spectra of GRB prompt emission is crucial,
as they provide key clues to understanding its gamma-ray emission mechanism.
Among the 15 GRB spectra, we found two cases with a significant high-energy
excess, and another case with a extremely high peak energy (\epeak $\gtrsim$
170 MeV). There have been very limited number of GRBs observed at MeV energies
and above, and only a few instruments have been capable of observing GRBs in
this energy band with such high sensitivity. Thus, our analysis results
presented here should also help predict GRB observations with current and
future high-energy instruments such as AGILE and GLAST, as well as with

measure of the mass density of a cluster within a projected radius of ~ 150
kpc, large enough to be relatively unaffected by gas physics. We show that the
observed Einstein radii of four well-studied massive clusters, for which
reliable virial masses are measured, lie well beyond the predicted distribution
of Einstein radii in the standard LambdaCDM model. Based on large samples of
numerically simulated cluster-sized objects with virial masses ~ 1e15 solar,
the predicted Einstein radii are only 15-25'', a factor of two below the
observed Einstein radii of these four clusters. This is because the predicted
mass profile is too shallow to exceed the critical surface density for lensing
at a sizable projected radius. After carefully accounting for measurement
errors as well as the biases inherent in the selection of clusters and the
projection of mass measured by lensing, we find that the theoretical
predictions are excluded at a 4-sigma significance. Since most of the free
parameters of the LambdaCDM model now rest on firm empirical ground, this
discrepancy may point to an additional mechanism that promotes the collapse of
clusters at an earlier time thereby enhancing their central mass density.

polaritons, a second, anomalous, damping-induced dispersion branch arises and
develops with increasing damping. In this case, the strong-weak coupling
transition is attributed to a critical damping rate, when the intersection of
the normal and damping-induced dispersion branches occurs. For the radiative
states of QW excitons, i.e., for radiative QW polaritons, the transition is
described as a qualitative change of the photoluminescence spectrum at grazing
angles along the QW structure. Furthermore, we show that the radiative
corrections to the QW exciton states with in-plane wavevector approaching the
photon cone are universally scaled by an energy parameter rather than diverge.
The strong-weak coupling transition rates are also proportional to the same
energy parameter. The numerical evaluations are given for a GaAs single quantum
well with realistic parameters.

$D$ crosses its critical value $D_c$, the entanglement undergoes a revival. The
maximum value of the entanglement occurs in the revival region. In finite
temperatures there are revival regions in $D-T$ plane. In these regions,
entanglement first increases with increasing temperature and then decreases and
ultimately vanishes for temperatures above a critical value. This critical
temperature is an increasing function of $D$, thus the nonzero entanglement can
exist for larger temperatures. In addition, the amount of entanglement in the
revival region depends on the spin-orbit parameter. Also, the entanglement
teleportation via the quantum channel constructed by the above system is

locally compact quantum groups, in particular, deformations of the classical
$az+b$ group and of the Woronowicz' quantum $az+b$ group.

triangular matrices with determinant 1 using the twisting construction. An
interesting feature of this new example of a locally compact quantum group is
that the Haar measure is deformed in a non-trivial way. Also, we give a
complete description of the dual $\cs$-algebra and the dual comultiplication.

sigma and fo(980) overlap in the same partial wave. The conjecture of Extended
Unitarity (EU) states that the pi-pi pair should have the same phase variation
as pi-pi elastic scattering. This is an extension of Watson's theorem beyond
its original derivation, which stated only that the s-dependence of a single
resonance should be universal. The prediction of EU is that the deep dip
observed in pi-pi elastic scattering close to 1 GeV should also appear in
production data. Four sets of data disagree with this prediction. All require
different relative magnitudes of sigma and fo(980). That being so, a fresh
conjecture is to rewrite the 2-body unitarity relation for production in terms
of observed magnitudes. This leads to a prediction different to EU. Central
production data from the AFS experiment fit naturally to this hypothesis.

the resistance of each edge $e$ at distance $d$ from the root is defined by
$r_e=2^dX_e$ where the $X_e$ are i.i.d. positive random variables bounded away
