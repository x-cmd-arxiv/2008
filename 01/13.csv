  cell-like selectivity","16 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  Through evolution, animals have acquired central nervous systems (CNSs),
which are extremely efficient information processing devices that improve an
animal's adaptability to various environments. It has been proposed that the
process of information maximization (infomax), which maximizes the information
transmission from the input to the output of a feedforward network, may provide
an explanation of the stimulus selectivity of neurons in CNSs. However, CNSs
contain not only feedforward but also recurrent synaptic connections, and
little is known about information retention over time in such recurrent
networks. Here, we propose a learning algorithm based on infomax in a recurrent
network, which we call ""recurrent infomax"" (RI). RI maximizes information
retention and thereby minimizes information loss in a network. We find that
feeding in external inputs consisting of information obtained from photographs
of natural scenes into an RI-based model of a recurrent network results in the
appearance of Gabor-like selectivity quite similar tothat existing in simple
cells of the primary visual cortex (V1). More importantly, we find that without
external input, this network exhibits cell assembly-like and synfire chain-like
spontaneous activity and a critical neuronal avalanche. RI provides a simple
framework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in vivo and in vitro
neuronal networks, and it should provide a novel understanding of experimental
results for multineuronal activity and plasticity from an information-theoretic
point of view.

into account the line celerity was proposed. In this paper we consider a form
of the interfacial energy of a solid surface in which many small oscillations
are superposed on a slowly varying function. For a capillary tube, a scaling
analysis of the microscopic law associated with the Young-Dupr\'e dynamic
equation yields a macroscopic equation for the motion of the contact line. The
value of the deduced apparent dynamic contact angle yields for the average
response of the line motion a phenomenon akin to the stick-slip motion of the
contact line on the solid wall. The contact angle hysteresis phenomenon and the
modelling of experimentally well-known results expressing the dependence of the
apparent dynamic contact angle on the celerity of the line are obtained.

atomic gases provided an exceptional opportunity to observe and study
superfluidity in an extremely clean and controlled environment. In the solid

several times. Polaritons are strongly interacting light-matter
quasi-particles, naturally occurring in semiconductor microcavities in the
strong coupling regime and constitute a very interesting example of composite

energy to the solar loop is extremely weaker than the magnetic energy
contribution. In this case solar loops of up $5000 km$ in diameter can be
reached. The height of $220.000 km$ is used to obtain an estimate for torsion
based on the Riemannian flux tube surface, which yields ${\tau}_{0}=0.9{\times}

is consistent with experimental results in solar physics. These results are
obtained for a homogeneous twisted solar loop. By making use of Moffatt-Ricca
theorem for the bounds on torsional energy of unknotted vortex filaments,
applied to magnetic topology, one places bounds on the lengths of EUV solar

matrix. When there is no inspecificity, this gives the classical result of
convergence to the first principal component of the input distribution (PC1).
We then study the outcome of learning using different versions of E. In the
most biologically plausible case, arising when there are no intrinsically
privileged connections, E has diagonal elements Q and off- diagonal elements
(1-Q)/(n-1), where Q, the quality, is expected to decrease with the number of
inputs n. We analyze this error-onto-all case in detail, for both uncorrelated
and correlated inputs. We study the dependence of the angle theta between PC1
and the leading eigenvector of EC on b, n and the amount of input activity or
correlation. (We do this analytically and using Matlab calculations.) We find
that theta increases (learning becomes gradually less useful) with increases in
b, particularly for intermediate (i.e. biologically-realistic) correlation
strength, although some useful learning always occurs up to the trivial limit Q
= 1/n. We discuss the relation of our results to Hebbian unsupervised learning
in the brain.

unpredictable chaotic dynamics. Their inevitable role in applications like
sonoluminescence, sonochemistry and medical procedures suggests that their
dynamics be controlled. Reducing chaotic oscillations could be the first step
in controlling the bubble dynamics by increasing the predictability of the
bubble response to an applied acoustic field. One way to achieve this concept
is to perturb the acoustic forcing. Recently, due to the improvements
associated with using dual frequency sources, this method has been the subject
of many studies which have proved its applicability and advantages. Due to this
reason, in this paper, the oscillations of a spherical bubble driven by a dual
frequency source, were studied and compared to the ones driven by a single
source. Results indicated that using dual frequency had a strong impact on
reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular ones. The governing parameters
influencing its dynamics are the secondary frequency and its phase difference
with the fundamental frequency. Also using dual frequency forcing may arm us by
the possibility of generating oscillations of desired amplitudes. To our
knowledge the investigation of the ability of using a dual frequency forcing to
control chaotic oscillations are presented for the first time in this paper.

codes of galaxy formation. The approach is based on the analysis of the outputs
from the model after a series of perturbations in the input parameters
controlling the baryonic physics. The perturbations are chosen in a way that
they do not change the results in the luminosity function or mass function of
the galaxy population. We apply this approach on a particular semi-analytic
model called GalICS. We chose to perturb the parameters controlling the
efficiency of star formation and the efficiency of supernova feedback. We keep
track of the baryonic and observable properties of the central galaxies in a
sample of dark matter halos with masses ranging from 10^{10} M_sol to 10^{13}
M_sol. We find very different responses depending on the halo mass. For small
dark matter halos its central galaxy responds in a highly predictable way to
small perturbation in the star formation and feedback efficiency. For massive
dark matter halos, minor perturbations in the input parameters can induce large
fluctuations on the properties of its central galaxy, at least $\sim 0.1$ in
(B-V) color or $\sim 0.5$ mag in U or r filter, in a seemingly random fashion.
We quantify this behavior through an objective scalar function we call
predictability. We argue that finding the origin of this behavior needs
additional information from other approximations and different semi-analytic
codes. Furthermore, the implementation of an scalar objective function, such as
the predictability, opens the door to quantitative benchmarking of

merger trees. The contour process produces a one-dimensional object, the
contour walk, which is a translation of the merger tree. We portray the contour
walk through its length and action. The length is proportional to to the number
of progenitors in the tree, and the action can be interpreted as a proxy of the
mean length of a branch in a merger tree.
  We obtain the contour walk for merger trees extracted from the public
database of the Millennium Run and also for merger trees constructed with a
public Monte-Carlo code which implements a Markovian algorithm. The trees
correspond to halos of final masses between 10^{11} h^{-1} M_sol and 10^{14}
h^{-1} M_sol. We study how the length and action of the walks evolve with the
mass of the final halo. In all the cases, except for the action measured from
Markovian trees, we find a transitional scale around 3 \times 10^{12} h^{-1}
M_sol. As a general trend the length and action measured from the Markovian
trees show a large scatter in comparison with the case of the Millennium Run
trees.

Title","Emergence of a Helical Flux Rope Under an Active Region Prominence","10 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/528792",,"astro-ph",,"  Continuous observations were obtained of active region 10953 with the Solar
Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the \emph{Hinode} satellite during 2007 April
28 to May 9. A prominence was located over the polarity inversion line (PIL) in
the south-east of the main sunspot. These observations provided us with a time
series of vector magnetic fields on the photosphere under the prominence. We
found four features: (1) The abutting opposite-polarity regions on the two
sides along the PIL first grew laterally in size and then narrowed. (2) These
abutting regions contained vertically-weak, but horizontally-strong magnetic
fields. (3) The orientations of the horizontal magnetic fields along the PIL on
the photosphere gradually changed with time from a normal-polarity
configuration to a inverse-polarity one. (4) The horizontal-magnetic field
region was blueshifted. These indicate that helical flux rope was emerging from
below the photosphere into the corona along the PIL under the pre-existing
prominence. We suggest that this supply of a helical magnetic flux into the
corona is associated with evolution and maintenance of active-region
prominences.

  improved wording in Intro. and Concl",,,,"hep-th",,"  We calculate the phase space factor for a two-body decay in which one of the
products is a tachyon. Two threshold conditions, a lower and an upper one, are
derived in terms of the masses of the particles and the speed of a preferred
frame. Implicit in the derivation is a consistently formulated quantum field
theory of tachyons in which spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking occurs. The
result is to be contrasted with a parallel calculation by Hughes and
Stephenson, which, however, implicitly adheres to strict Lorentz invariance of
the underlying quantum field theory and produces the conclusion that there is
no threshold for this process.

many-body dynamics for quantum information and computation purposes. In
particular, we consider a one dimensional array of three level systems
interacting via a nearest-neighbour interaction. By encoding the qubit on two
levels and using simple projective frequent measurements yielding the quantum
Zeno effect, we demonstrate how to implement a well defined quantum register,
quantum state transfer on demand, universal two-qubit gates and two-qubit
parity measurements. Thus, we argue that the main ingredients for universal
quantum computation can be achieved in a spin chain with an always-on and
constant many-body Hamiltonian. We also show some possible modifications of the
initially assumed dynamics in order to create maximally entangled qubit pairs
and single qubit gates.

field of thermal (or superthermal) strength. In such a strong magnetic field,
many MHD instabilities responsible for turbulent transport of the angular
momentum are suppressed. We consider the shear-driven instability that can
occur in protostellar disks even if the field is superthermal. This instability
is caused by the combined influence of shear and compressibility in a
magnetized gas and can be an efficient mechanism to generate turbulence in
disks. The typical growth time is of the order of several rotation periods.

been analysed by comparing several hydrogen-passivated and not passivated
nanotube segments. The dependence of the EA and IP on both the quantum
confinement effect, due to the nanotube finite length, and the charge
accumulation on the edges, is studied in detail. Also, the EA and IP are
compared to the energies of the lowest unoccupied and highest occupied states,
respectively, upon increasing the nanotube length. We report a slow convergence
with respect to the number of atoms. The effect of nanotube packing in arrays
on the electronic properties is eventually elucidated as a function of the
intertube distance.
