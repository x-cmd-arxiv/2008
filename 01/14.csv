family: suprafroth, in which the cell boundaries are superconducting and the
cell interior is normal phase. Despite very different microscopic origin,
topological analysis of the structure of the suprafroth shows that statistical
von Neumann and Lewis laws apply. Furthermore, for the first time in the
analysis of froths there is a global measurable property, the magnetic moment,
which can be directly related to the suprafroth structure. We propose that this
suprafroth is a new, model system for the analysis of the complex physics of
two-dimensional froths.

the DGR in clusters is higher than that of the field at all redshifts, implying

find that the DGR evolves with redshift for both samples, consistent with the
``down-sizing'' picture of star formation. We examine the predictions of
semi-analytic models for the DGR and find that neither the magnitude of its
environmental dependence nor its evolution is correctly predicted in the

likely explanation being that the strangulation mechanism used to remove hot
gas from satellite galaxies is too efficient. Finally we present a simple toy
model including a threshold mass, below which galaxies are not strangled, and
show that this can predict the observed evolution of the field DGR.

the view that these are fundamentally different things, even though the

symmetry for such belief models: weak invariance (representing symmetry of

defined and their potential for application is illustrated with respect to the
investigation of 6 different types of networks. The outward accessibility
quantifies the potential of an individual node for accessing other nodes
through random walks. The inward accessibility measures the potential of a
given node of being accessed by other nodes. Both the inward and outward
accessibilities are measured with respect to successive time steps along the
walks, providing an interesting means for the characterization of the transient
non-linear dynamics of accessibility. Self-avoiding walks are considered here
because they are more purposive and necessarily finite (unlike traditional
random walks). The results include the identification of the fact that the
inward values tend to be much smaller than the outward values, the tendency of
the inward accessibility to be highly correlated with the node degree while the
outward values are mostly uncorrelated with that measurements, the distinct
behavior of the accessibility in geographical networks, the dominance of hubs
in scale free networks, as well as the enhanced uniformity of the
accessibilities for the path-regular model. Also investigated was the
possibility to predict the accessibility of a given node in terms of its
respective degree. The concepts of inward and outward accessibility, as well as
the several obtained results, have several implications and potential for
applications to several real-time problems including disease spreading, WWW

smaller $\Delta$ ($\alpha$ regions), both of which are randomly distributed in
space. We find that $A({\bf k}, \omega)$ is most strongly affected by
inhomogeneity near the point $\mathbf k = (\pi, 0)$ (and the symmetry-related
points). For $c_\beta\simeq 0.5$, $A({\bf k}, \omega)$ exhibits two double
peaks (at positive and negative energy) near this k-point if the difference
between $\Delta_\alpha$ and $\Delta_\beta$ is sufficiently large in comparison
to the hopping integral. The strength of the inhomogeneity required to produce
a split spectral function peak suggests that inhomogeneity is unlikely to be
the cause of a second branch in the dispersion relation. Thermal fluctuations
also affect $A({\bf k}, \omega)$ most strongly near $\mathbf k = (\pi,0)$.
Typically, peaks that are sharp at $T = 0$ become reduced in height, broadened,
and shifted toward lower energies with increasing $T$; the spectral weight near
$\mathbf k = (\pi, 0)$ becomes substantial at zero energy for $T$ greater than
the phase-ordering temperature.

(Sersic index + ``Bumpiness''), and local environment. We show that morphology
and structure are intrinsically different galaxy properties, and we demonstrate
that this is a physically relevant distinction by showing that these properties
depend differently on galaxy mass and environment. Structure mainly depends on
galaxy mass whereas morphology mainly depends on environment. This is driven by
variations in star formation activity, as traced by color, which only weakly
affects the structure of a galaxy but strongly affects its morphological
appearance. The implication of our results is that the existence of the
morphology-density relation is intrinsic and not just due to a combination of
more fundamental, underlying relations. Our findings have consequences for
high-redshift studies, which often use some measure of structure as a proxy for
morphology. A direct comparison with local samples selected through visually

sections are calculated, using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), for
grains of three compositions (50% silicate and 50% graphite; 50% silicate and
50% amorphous carbon; and 100% silicate), for wavelengths from 0.1 micron to 4
micron. For fixed particle mass, increased porosity increases the extinction at
short wavelengths, but decreases the extinction at wavelengths long compared to
the overall aggregate size. Scattering and absorption cross sections are
insensitive to monomer size as long as the constituent monomers are small
compared with the incident wavelength. We compare our accurate DDA results with
two other approximations: the analytical multi-layer sphere (MLS) model and
effective medium theory (EMT). For high porosity and/or absorptive materials,
the MLS model does not provide a good approximation for scattering and
absorption by ballistic aggregates. The EMT method provides a much better
approximation than the MLS model for these aggregates, with a typical
difference less than 20% in extinction and scattering cross sections compared
with DDA results, for all types, compositions and wavelengths probed in this
study.

supernova-driven galactic winds, as suggested by the flatness of the

to reconstruct the radial profiles of gas temperature and density under the
assumption of a spherically symmetric distribution of the gas. The method of
reconstruction, first raised by Silk & White, depends directly on the
observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the X-ray surface brightness,
without involving additional assumptions such as the equation of state of the
gas or the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium. We applied this method to the
cluster RX J1347.5-1145, which has both the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and X-ray
observations with relative high precision. It is shown that it will be an
effective method to obtain the gas distribution in galaxy clusters. Statistical
errors of the derived temperature and density profiles of gas were estimated
according to the observational uncertainties.

relativistic era and a non-relativistic matter phase, is a popular dark energy
candidate. We consider a generalization of the Chaplygin gas model, by assuming
the presence of a bulk viscous type dissipative term in the effective
thermodynamic pressure of the gas. The dissipative effects are described by
using the truncated Israel-Stewart model, with the bulk viscosity coefficient
and the relaxation time functions of the energy density only. The corresponding
cosmological dynamics of the bulk viscous Chaplygin gas dominated universe is
considered in detail for a flat homogeneous isotropic
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry. For different values of the model
parameters we consider the evolution of the cosmological parameters (scale
factor, energy density, Hubble function, deceleration parameter and luminosity
distance, respectively), by using both analytical and numerical methods. In the
large time limit the model describes an accelerating universe, with the
effective negative pressure induced by the Chaplygin gas and the bulk viscous
pressure driving the acceleration. The theoretical predictions of the
luminosity distance of our model are compared with the observations of the type
Ia supernovae. The model fits well the recent supernova data. From the fitting
we determine both the equation of state of the Chaplygin gas, and the
parameters characterizing the bulk viscosity. The evolution of the scalar field
associated to the viscous Chaplygin fluid is also considered, and the
corresponding potential is obtained. Hence the viscous Chaplygin gas model
offers an effective dynamical possibility for replacing the cosmological
constant, and to explain the recent acceleration of the universe.

  ApJ",,"10.1086/589961",,"astro-ph",,"  SN 2006jc is a peculiar supernova (SN), in which the formation of dust has
been confirmed at an early epoch of ~50 days after the explosion. We
investigate the possibility of such an earlier formation of dust grains in the
expanding ejecta of SN 2006jc, applying the Type Ib SN model that is developed
to reproduce the observed light curve. We find that the rapid decrease of the
gas temperature in SN 2006jc enables the condensation of C grains in the C-rich
layer at 40-60 days after the explosion, which is followed by the condensation
of silicate and oxide grains until ~200 days. The average radius of each grain
species is confined to be less than 0.01 micron due to the low gas density at
the condensation time. The calculated total dust mass reaches ~1.5 Msun, of
which C dust shares 0.7 Msun. On the other hand, based on the calculated dust
temperature, we show that the dust species and mass evaluated to reproduce the
spectral energy distribution observed by AKARI and MAGNUM at day 200 are
different from those obtained by the dust formation calculations; the dust
species contributing to the observed flux are hot C and FeS grains with masses
of $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Msun and $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ Msun, respectively,
though we cannot defy the presence of a large amount of cold dust such as
silicate and oxide grains up to 0.5 Msun. One of the physical processes
responsible for the difference between calculated and evaluated masses of C and
FeS grains could be considered to be the destruction of small-sized clusters by
energetic photons and electrons prevailing within the ejecta at the earlier
epoch.

reproduces established results from the overlap formalism and is designed to
preserve nontrivial topological objects including instantons. At short
distances we focus on the topological charge correlator, $<q(x) q(0) >$, where
negative values at small $x$ reveal a sign-alternating layered structure to the
topological-charge density of the QCD vacuum. We find that the magnitudes of
the negative dip in the $<q(x)q(0)>$ correlator and the positive $<q(0)^2>$
contact term are both increased with the introduction of dynamical fermion
degrees of freedom. This is in accord with expectations based on charge
renormalization and the vanishing of the topological susceptibility in the
chiral limit. At large distances we examine the extent to which instanton-like
objects are found on the lattice, and how their distributions vary between
quenched and dynamical gauge fields. We show that dynamical gauge fields
contain more instanton-like objects with an average size greater than in the
quenched vacuum. Finally, we directly visualize the topological charge density
in order to investigate the effects of dynamical sea-quark degrees of freedom

standard models, the evolution of the chemical composition is solved by stiffly
stable schemes of orders up to four; in the convection zones mixing and

These empirical formulas are shown to be applicable not only to the evaluation
of the lowest energy but also to the evaluation of excited energies of systems
under random two-body interactions.

developed to detect coregulatory relationships among genes from microarray gene

statistically well grounded methods, but the properties of these algorithms
when applied to large-scale data sets are not always well understood. An
in-depth analysis can reveal important insights about the performance of the
algorithm, the expected quality of the output clusters, and the possibilities
for extracting more relevant information out of a particular data set. We have
extended an existing algorithm for model based clustering of genes to
simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, and used three large compendia of
gene expression data for S. cerevisiae to analyze its properties. The algorithm
uses a Bayesian approach and a Gibbs sampling procedure to iteratively update
the cluster assignment of each gene and condition. For large-scale data sets,
the posterior distribution is strongly peaked on a limited number of
equiprobable clusterings. A GO annotation analysis shows that these local
maxima are all biologically equally significant, and that simultaneously
clustering genes and conditions performs better than only clustering genes and
assuming independent conditions. A collection of distinct equivalent
clusterings can be summarized as a weighted graph on the set of genes, from
which we extract fuzzy, overlapping clusters using a graph spectral method. The
cores of these fuzzy clusters contain tight sets of strongly coexpressed genes,
while the overlaps exhibit relations between genes showing only partial
coexpression.

phylogenesis and ontogenesis, in the light of the notion of biological
organization as negative entropy, following some hints by Schroedinger. To this
purpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are
(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no
meaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be
then extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider
far from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of
global entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A
close analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion
equation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a
tool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for
his equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the
operatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real
coefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of
quantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple
mathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over
complexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of
different time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy
and negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze
metabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant
coefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.
Finally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,
also in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).

This simultaneously generates all the dimensionful parameters such as the
Newton's gravitational constant, the particle masses and the vacuum or dark
energy. We find that in its simplest version the model predicts the Higgs mass
to be very small, which is ruled out experimentally. We further generalize the
model such that it displays local scale invariance. In this case the Higgs
particle disappears from the particle spectrum and instead we find a very
massive vector boson. Hence the model gives a consistent description of

the longitudinal width of the Bragg scattering, which diverges as a power law,

unusual features, since an incident wave may split into two reflected ones at a

evanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value. These reflection

However, one might believe that for systems with high enough symmetry, and thus
insufficient parameters to encode a quantum computation, efficient classical
simulation is possible. We discuss supporting evidence to the contrary: We
provide a rigorous proof of the observation that a time independent local

pulses in media with dispersion, dispersionless media and vacuum. The applied
method of amplitude envelopes gives the opportunity to estimate the limits of
slowly warring amplitude approximation and to describe an amplitude
integro-differential equation, governing the propagation of optical pulses in
single cycle regime. The well known slowly varying amplitude equation and the
amplitude equation for vacuum are written in dimensionless form. Three
parameters are obtained defining different linear regimes of the optical pulses
evolution. In contrast to previous studies we demonstrate that in femtosecond
region the nonparaxial terms are not small and can dominate over transverse
Laplacian. The normalized amplitude nonparaxial equations are solved using the
method of Fourier transforms. Fundamental solutions with spectral kernels
different from Fresnel one are found. One unexpected new result is the relative
stability of light pulses with spherical and spheroidal spatial form, when we
compare their transverse enlargement with the paraxial diffraction of lights
beam in air. It is important to emphasize here the case of light disks, i.e.
pulses whose longitudinal size is small with respect to the transverse one,
which in some partial cases are practically diffractionless over distances of
thousand kilometers. A new formula which calculates the diffraction length of
optical pulses is suggested.

wave-length baseline, in the UBVRI bands, allows us to build up a suite of

tool to disentangle the stellar populations of the region. In fact, the simple
use of one colour magnitude diagram, widely employed in all the previous

to separate the effects of the different parameters (reddening, age,

88%, 91% and 68% of the total emission in the 25-50, 50-100 and 100-300 keV
domains respectively. We have compared the GR emission spatial distribution to
those obtained from CO and NIR maps, and quantified our results through
latitude and longitude profiles. Below 50 keV, the SPI data are better traced
by the latter, supporting a stellar origin for this emission. Furthermore, we
found that the GR emission spectrum follows a power law with a photon index ~
1.55 above 50 keV while an additional component is required below this energy.
This component shows a cutoff around 30 keV, reinforcing a stellar origin, as
proposed by Krivonos et al. (2007). The annihilation diffuse emission component
is extracted simultaneously, leading to the determination of the related
parameters (positronium flux and fraction). A specific discussion is devoted to
the annihilation line distribution since a significant emission is detected

phenomena involving shocks, interfaces or material surfaces. The equations
representing evolutions of these media are irregular through geometrical
manifolds. A unique continuous medium is conceptually simpler than several
media with surfaces of singularity. To avoid the surfaces of discontinuity in
the theory, we transform the model by considering a continuous medium taking
intoaccount more complete internal energies expressed in gradient developments
associated with the variables of state. Nevertheless, resulting equations of
motion are of an higher order than those of the classical models: they lead to
non-linear models associated with more complex integration processes on the
mathematical level as well as on the numerical point of view. In fact, such
models allow a precise study of singular zones when they have a non negligible
physical thickness. This is typically the case for capillarity phenomena in
fluids or mixtures of fluids in which interfacial zones are transition layers
between phases or layers between fluids and solid walls. Within the framework
of mechanics for continuous media, we propose to deal with the functional point
of view considering globally the equations of the media as well as the boundary
conditions associated with these equations. For this aim, we revisit the
d'Alembert-Lagrange principle of virtual works which is able to consider the
expressions of the works of forces applied to a continuous medium as a linear
functional value on a space of test functions in the form of virtual
displacements. At the end, we analyze examples corresponding to capillary
fluids. This analysis brings us to numerical or asymptotic methods avoiding the
difficulties due to singularities in simpler -but with singularities- models.

an approximate stellar evolution scheme for accreting pre-mainsequence stars
based on Hartmann, Cassen & Kenyon, 1997. We show that the observed range of
values $k = L_{\rm acc}/L_\ast$ between 0.01 and 1 can be reproduced if the
values of the disc mass fraction $M_{\rm disc}/M_*$ at the start of the T Tauri
phase lie in the range 0.01 -- 0.2, independent of stellar mass. We also show

D-term hybrid inflation as an example, we show that such flat directions can
