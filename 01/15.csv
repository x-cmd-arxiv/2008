universe by modeling the super-Hubble dynamics as a system of matter fields
coupled to gravity where the sub-Hubble field fluctuations induce a stochastic
force into the equations of motion. The super-Hubble dynamics are ultralocal,
allowing us to neglect spatial derivatives and treat each Hubble patch as a
separate universe. This provides a natural framework in which to discuss
probabilities on the space of solutions and initial conditions. In this article
we derive an evolution equation for this probability for an arbitrary class of
matter systems, including DBI and k-inflationary models, and discover
equilibrium solutions that satisfy detailed balance. Our results are more
general than those derived assuming slow roll or a quasi-de Sitter geometry,
and so are directly applicable to models that do not satisfy the usual slow
roll conditions. We discuss in general terms the conditions for eternal
inflation to set in, and we give explicit numerical solutions of highly
stochastic, quasi-stationary trajectories in the relativistic DBI regime.
Finally, we show that the probability for stochastic/thermal tunneling can be
significantly enhanced relative to the Hawking-Moss instanton result due to
relativistic DBI effects.

turning on the lattice is almost adiabatic. In this paper we investigate how
the temperature changes when going from the gapless superfluid phase to the
gapped Mott phase along isentropic lines. To do so we calculate the entropy in
the single-band Bose-Hubbard model for various densities, interaction strengths
and temperatures in one and two dimensions for homogeneous and trapped systems.
Our theory is able to reproduce the experimentally observed visibilities and
therefore strongly supports that current experiments remain in the quantum
regime for all considered lattice depths with low temperatures and minimal
heating.

radio galaxy NGC6251 observed with RXTE for 1 year. The primary goal of this
study is to shed light on the origin of the X-rays, by investigating the
spectral variability with model-independent methods coupled with time-resolved
and flux-selected spectroscopy. The main results can be summarized as follows:
1) Throughout the monitoring campaign, NGC6251 was in relatively high-flux
state. 2) The flux persistently changed with fluctuations of the order of ~2 on
time scales of 20-30 days. 3) When the hardness ratio is plotted against the
average count rate, there is evidence for a spectral hardening as the source
brightens; this finding is confirmed by a flux-selected spectral analysis. 4)
The fractional variability appears to be more pronounced in the hard energy
band (5-12 keV) than in the soft one (2.5-5 keV). 5) 2-month averaged and
flux-limited energy spectra are adequately fitted by a power law. A Fe Kalpha
line is never statistically required, although the presence of a strong iron
line cannot be ruled out, due to the high upper limits on the line equivalent
width. The inconsistency of the spectral variability behavior of NGC6251 with
the typical trend observed in Seyfert galaxies and the similarity with blazars
lead support to a jet-dominated scenario during the RXTE monitoring campaign.
However, a possible contribution from a disk-corona system cannot be ruled out.

that was reasonably compatible with the in-situ state of stress at a depth of
223 m. The relationship between suction and stress changes during loading and
unloading sequences were also examined by running oedometer tests with suction
measurements. A rather wide range of the ratio s/sigma 'v (being s the suction
and sigma 'v the effective vertical stress) was obtained (0.61 - 1), different
from that proposed by Bishop et al; (1974). Finally, the effect of suction
release under an isotropic stress close to the estimated sample suction was
investigated. A slight swelling (1.7%) was observed and further compression
provided a satisfactory value of the overconsolidation ratio confirming the
suggestions of taking some precautions before putting a swelling sample in

to the surface as dopants. We find that the binding energy of the two H atoms
near the dissociation site is high on Ti, effectively impeding diffusion away
from the Ti site. By contrast, we find that on Ni the energy barrier for
diffusion is much reduced. Therefore, although both Ti and Ni promote H$_2$
dissociation, only Ni appears to be a good catalyst for Mg hydrogenation,
allowing diffusion away from the catalytic sites. Experimental results
corroborate these theoretical findings, i.e. faster hydrogenation of the Ni
doped Mg sample as opposed to the reference Mg or Ti doped Mg.

circumstellar disc in the size regime ($\sim 1-5000$ km) where the
planetesimals behave approximately as test particles in the disc's
non-axisymmetric potential. We find that the particles respond to the
stochastic, regenerative spiral features in the disc by executing large random
excursions (up to a factor of two in radius in $\sim 1000$ years), although
typical random orbital velocities are of order one tenth of the Keplerian
speed. The limited time frame and small number of planetesimals modeled does
not permit us to discern any {\it net} direction of planetesimal migration. Our
chief conclusion is that the high eccentricities ($\sim 0.1$) induced by
interaction with spiral features in the disc is likely to be highly
unfavourable to the collisional growth of planetesimals in this size range
while the disc is in the self-gravitating regi me. Thus {\it if}, as recently
argued by Rice et al 2004, 2006, the production of planetesimals gets under way
when the disc is in the self-gravitating regime (either at smaller planetesimal
size scales, where gas drag is important, or via gravitational fragmentation of
the solid component), then the planetesimals thus produced would not be able to
grow collisionally until the disc ceased to be self-gravitating. It is unclear,
however,given the large amplitude excursions undergone by planetesimals in the
self-gravitating disc, whether they would be retained in the disc throughout
this period, or whether they would instead be lost to the central star.

perturbations induced by the interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium.
Our models simulate one or multiple ram pressure stripping events and galaxy
starvation. Models predict that all star forming dwarf galaxies entering the
cluster for the first time loose most, if not all, of their atomic gas content,
quenching on short time scales (< 150 Myr) their activity of star formation.
These dwarf galaxies soon become red and quiescent, gas metal-rich objects with
spectrophotometric and structural properties similar to those of dwarf
ellipticals. Young, low luminosity, high surface brightness star forming
galaxies such as late-type spirals and BCDs are probably the progenitors of
relatively massive dwarf ellipticals, while it is likely that low surface
brightness magellanic irregulars evolve into very low surface brightness
quiescent objects hardly detectable in ground based imaging surveys. The small
number of dwarf galaxies with physical properties intermediate between those of
star forming and quiescent systems is consistent with a rapid (< 1 Gyr)
transitional phase between the two dwarf galaxies populations. These results,
combined with statistical considerations, are consistent with the idea that
most of the dwarf ellipticals dominating the faint end of the Virgo luminosity
function were initially star forming systems, accreted by the cluster and
stripped of their gas by one or subsequent ram pressure stripping events.

analysis of the LIRGs/ULIRGs subsample, published in Gracia-Carpio et al.(2007)
we find the first clear observational evidence that the star formation
efficiency of the dense gas, measured by the L_FIR/L_HCN ratio, is
significantly higher in LIRGs and ULIRGs than in normal galaxies. Mounting
evidence of overabundant HCN in active environments would even reinforce the
reported trend, pointing to a significant turn upward in the Kennicutt-Schmidt
law around L_FIR=10^11 L_sun. This result has major implications for the use of
HCN as a tracer of the dense gas in local and high-redshift luminous infrared
galaxies.

gap between the thin and thick disks is incompatible with the thick disk having
formed from the thin disk by a continuous process, such as scattering of stars
by spiral arms or molecular clouds. Other mechanisms of formation of the thick

on a coplanar gaseous disk of finite radial extent. The disk tides, raised by
the infalling satellite, couple the satellite and disk. Dynamical friction
acting on the satellite then shrinks the radius of the coupled satellite-disk
system. Thus, the gas is ``shepherded'' to smaller radii. In addition, gas
shepherding produces a large surface density enhancement at the disk edge. If
the disk edge then becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments, it may give
rise to enhanced star formation. On the other hand, if the satellite is
sufficiently massive and dense, the gas may be transported from $\sim 100$ pc
to inside of a 10 to 10s of parsecs before completely fragmenting into stars. I
argue that gas shepherding may drive the fueling of active galaxies and central
starbursts and I compare this scenario to competing scenarios. I argue that
sufficiently large and dense super star clusters (acting as the shepherding
satellites) can shepherd a gas disk down to ten to tens of parsecs. Inside of
ten to tens of parsecs, another mechanism may operate, i.e., cloud-cloud
collisions or a marginally (gravitationally) stable disk, that drives the gas
$\lesssim 1$ pc, where it can be viscously accreted, feeding a central engine.

with pure H2 emission from shocked material with a power-law distribution of

the observed Band 2 intensity. Assuming that the column density of H2 at

degravitation paradigm seriously as a consistent modification of gravity in the
IR, and investigate its consequences for various cosmological situations. We
motivate degravitation-- where Netwon's constant is promoted to a scale
dependent filter function-- as arising from either a small (resonant) mass for
the graviton, or as an effect in semi-classical gravity. After addressing how
the Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our
attention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By
considering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive
graviton (with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show
that slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain
quantitatively unchanged. We also find that the degravitation mechanism
inherits a memory of past energy densities in the present epoch in such a way
that is likely significant for present cosmological evolution. For example, if
the universe underwent inflation in the past due to it having tunneled out of
some false vacuum, we find that degravitation implies a remnant `afterglow'
cosmological constant, whose scale immediately afterwards is parametrically
suppressed by the filter scale ($L$) in Planck units $\Lambda \sim
l^2_{pl}/L^2$. We discuss circumstances through which this scenario reasonably
yields the presently observed value for $\Lambda \sim O(10^{-120})$. We also
find that in a universe still currently trapped in some false vacuum state,
resonance graviton models of degravitation only degravitate initially Planck or
GUT scale energy densities down to the presently observed value over timescales
comparable to the filter scale.

a consequence of the diffuse, magnetically-dominated surface layers of the
disk, where the turbulence is suppressed and the conductivity is very high.
This structure arises naturally in three-dimensional simulations of
magnetorotationally unstable disks, and we demonstrate here that it can easily
support inward advection and compression of a weak field. The advected field is
anchored in the surface layer but penetrates the main body of the disk, where
it can generate strong turbulence and produce values of alpha (i.e., the
turbulent stress) large enough to match observational constraints; typical
values of the vertical magnetic field merely need to reach a few percent of
equipartition for this to occur. Overall, these results have important
implications for models of jet formation which require strong, large-scale
magnetic fields to exist over a region of the inner accretion disk.

colour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,
causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. Important tests for
this scenario include (i) the X-ray properties of galaxies in the transition
zone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of AGN in post-starbursts,
i.e. systems observed shortly after (<1Gyr) the termination of their
star-formation. We perform these tests by combining deep Chandra observations
with multiwavelength data from the AEGIS survey. Stacking the X-ray photons at
the positions of galaxies (0.4<z<0.9) not individually detected at X-ray
wavelengths suggests a population of obscured AGN among sources in the
transition zone and in the red cloud. Their mean X-ray and mid-IR properties
are consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity AGN, Compton thick
sources or a mix of both. Morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely to
drive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.
The incidence of obscured AGN in the red cloud (both direct detections and
stacking results) suggests that BH accretion outlives the termination of the
star-formation. This is also supported by our finding that post-starburst
galaxies at z~0.8 and AGN are associated, in agreement with recent results at
low-z. A large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidence
for at least moderate levels of AGN obscuration. This implies that if AGN
outflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas and
dust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regions
after the quenching their star-formation.

distribution with respect to mass and orbital separation. In order to achieve
these goals in reasonable time, a well-coordinated effort involving a network
of either 2m or 4 x 1m telescopes at each site is required. It could lead to
the first detection of an Earth-mass planet outside the Solar system, and even
planets less massive than Earth could be discovered. From April 2008, ARTEMiS
(Automated Robotic Terrestrial Exoplanet Microlensing Search) is planned to
provide a platform for a three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly
monitoring. As an expert system embedded in eSTAR (e-Science Telescopes for
Astronomical Research), ARTEMiS will give advice on the optimal targets to be
observed at any given time, and will also alert on deviations from ordinary
microlensing light curves by means of the SIGNALMEN anomaly detector. While the
use of the VOEvent (Virtual Observatory Event) protocol allows a direct
interaction with the telescopes that are part of the HTN (Heterogeneous
Telescope Networks) consortium, additional interfaces provide means of
communication with all existing microlensing campaigns that rely on human
observers. The success of discovering a planet by microlensing critically
depends on the availability of a telescope in a suitable location at the right
time, which can mean within 10 min. Real-time modelling offers the opportunity
of live discovery of extra-solar planets, thereby providing ''Science live to

perspective of F-theory. We consider this approach promising since, by working
effectively with an elliptically fibred M-theory compactification, the explicit
positioning of D7-branes by (M-theory) fluxes is straightforward. The locations
of D7-branes are encoded in the periods of certain M-theory cycles, which
allows for a very explicit understanding of the moduli space of D7-brane
motion. The picture of moving D7-branes on a fixed underlying space relies on
negligible backreaction, which can be ensured in Sen's weak coupling limit.
However, even in this limit we find certain 'physics obstructions' which reduce
the freedom of the D7-brane motion as compared to the motion of holomorphic
submanifolds in the orientifold background. These obstructions originate in the
intersections of D7-branes and O7-planes, where the type IIB coupling can not
remain weak. We illustrate this effect for D7-brane models on CP^1 x CP^1 (the
Bianchi-Sagnotti-Gimon-Polchinski model) and on CP^2. Furthermore, in the
simple example of 16 D7-branes and 4 O7-planes on CP^1 (F-theory on K3), we
obtain a completely explicit parameterization of the moduli space in terms of
periods of integral M-theory cycles. In the weak coupling limit, D7-brane
motion factorizes from the geometric deformations of the base space.

indicates that the filaments are likely to be a few tens of Myrs old. We also
present arguments which suggest that the momentum transfer, from an outflowing
wind, in the formation of these filaments is probably significant. As a result,
tail formation could play a role in dissipating some of the energy injected by
a central AGN close to the cluster centre where it is needed most. The trapping
of energy by the cold gas may provide an additional feedback mechanism that
helps to regulate the heating of the central regions of galaxy clusters and
couple the AGN to the ICM.

constrain the extent and covering fraction of Mg^+ ions around galaxies of
different luminosity and mass. The current sample consists of 13 galaxy and
absorber pairs and 10 galaxies that do not produce MgII absorption lines to
within sensitive upper limits. The redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairs
range from z = 0.2067 to 0.892 with a median of z = 0.3818. We find that

This anti-correlation is substantially improved when accounting for the

distinct boundary at rho=R_gas, beyond which no MgII absorbers are found. A
maximum likelihood analysis shows that the observations are best described by
an isothermal density profile and a scaling relation R_gas = 91 x

between halo mass and galaxy luminosity inferred from halo occupation studies,
this scaling of R_gas indicates that gas radius is a fixed fraction of the dark

excess at 24 microns, indicative of circumstellar dust. If all of the dusty
sources are experiencing mass loss, the cumulative rate of loss is estimated at
2.9 - 4.2 x 10^(-7) solar masses per year, 63% -- 66% of which is supplied by

gamma-ray emission, produced by inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic-ray
(CR) electrons on the solar radiation field. The emission was predicted to be
extended and a confusing foreground for the diffuse extragalactic background
even at large angular distances from the Sun. The solar disk is also expected
to be a steady gamma-ray source. While these emissions are expected to be
readily detectable in the future by GLAST, the situation for available EGRET
data is more challenging. Aims: The theory of gamma-ray emission from IC
scattering on the solar radiation field by Galactic CR electrons is given in
detail. This is used as the basis for detection and model verification using
EGRET data. Methods: We present a detailed study of the solar emission using
the EGRET database, accounting for the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the
moon, and other sources, which interfere with the solar emission. The analysis
was performed for 2 energy ranges, above 300 MeV and for 100-300 MeV, as well
as for the combination to improve the detection statistics. The technique was
tested on the moon signal, with our results consistent with previous work.
Results: Analyzing the EGRET database, we find evidence of emission from the
solar disk and its halo. The observations are compared with our model for the
extended emission. The spectrum of the solar disk emission and the spectrum of
the extended emission have been obtained. The spectrum of the moon is also
given. Conclusions: The observed intensity distribution and the flux are
consistent with the predicted model of IC gamma-rays from the halo around the
Sun.

  Referee recommendations incorporated (in particular, a longer introduction)",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent works of Alon-Shapira and R\""odl-Schacht have demonstrated that every
hereditary property of undirected graphs or hypergraphs is testable with
one-sided error; informally, this means that if a graph or hypergraph satisfies
that property ""locally"" with sufficiently high probability, then it can be
perturbed (or ""repaired"") into a graph or hypergraph which satisfies that
property ""globally"".
  In this paper we make some refinements to these results, some of which may be
surprising. In the positive direction, we strengthen the results to cover
hereditary properties of multiple directed polychromatic graphs and
hypergraphs. In the case of undirected graphs, we extend the result to
continuous graphs on probability spaces, and show that the repair algorithm is
""local"" in the sense that it only depends on a bounded amount of data; in
particular, the graph can be repaired in a time linear in the number of edges.
We also show that local repairability also holds for monotone or partite
hypergraph properties (this latter result is also implicitly in work of
Ishigami). In the negative direction, we show that local repairability breaks
down for directed graphs, or for undirected 3-uniform hypergraphs. The reason
for this contrast in behavior stems from (the limitations of) Ramsey theory.

Short-range attraction is represented by an overall factor epsilon<<1 in the
detachment rates relatively to isolated particle hopping rates [epsilon ~
exp(-E/T), with binding energy E and temperature T]. We consider various
gamma(m), from rapidly increasing forms such as gamma(m) ~ m to slowly
increasing ones, such as gamma(m) ~ [m/(m+1)]^b. A mapping onto a column
problem shows that these systems are zero-range processes, whose steady states
properties are exactly calculated under the assumption of independent column
heights in the Master equation. Simulation provides island size distributions
which confirm analytic reductions and are useful whenever the analytical tools
cannot provide results in closed form. The shape of island size distributions
can be changed from monomodal to monotonically decreasing by tuning the
temperature or changing the particle density rho. Small values of the scaling
variable X=epsilon^{-1}rho/(1-rho) favour the monotonically decreasing ones.
However, for large X, rapidly increasing gamma(m) lead to distributions with
peaks very close to <m> and rapidly decreasing tails, while slowly increasing
gamma(m) provide peaks close to <m>/2$ and fat right tails.

Although hydrodynamics is not used in this study, the validity of
hydrodynamical expansion is not excluded at later time after equilibration is
achieved. Phenomenological properties of the bulk and ridge behaviors are used
as inputs to determine the elliptic flow of pion and proton at low p_T. At
intermediate p_T the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons
becomes more important. The phi dependence arises from the variation of the
in-medium path length of the hard parton that generates the shower. The p_T
dependence of v_2 is therefore very different at intermediate p_T compared to
that at low p_T. Quark number scaling of v_2 is shown to be only approximately

  several derived numbers",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20079000",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: New eclipse minimum timings of the M4.5/M4.5 binary CM Dra were
obtained between the years 2000 and 2007. In combination with published timings
going back to 1977, a clear non-linearity in observed-minus-calculated (O-C)
times has become apparent. Several models are applied to explain the observed
timing behavior.
  Aims: Revealing the processes that cause the observed O-C behavior, and
testing the evidence for a third body around the CM Dra system.
  Methods: The O-C times of the system were fitted against several functions,
representing different physical origins of the timing variations.
  Results: An analysis using model-selection statistics gives about equal
weight to a parabolic and to a sinusoidal fitting function. Attraction from a
third body, either at large distance in a quasi-constant constellation across
the years of observations or from a body on a shorter orbit generating
periodicities in O-C times is the most likely source of the observed O-C times.
The white dwarf GJ 630.1B, a proper motion companion of CM Dra, can however be
rejected as the responsible third body. Also, no further evidence of the
short-periodic planet candidate described by Deeg et al. (2000) is found,
whereas other mechanisms, such as period changes from stellar winds or
Applegate's mechanism can be rejected.
  Conclusions: A third body, being either a few-Jupiter-mass object with a
period of 18.5+-4.5 years or an object in the mass range of 1.5M_jup to
0.1M_sun with periods of hundreds to thousands of years is the most likely
origin of the observed minimum timing behavior.

imaging of heliospheric interface by in-situ detection of Energetic Neutral
Atoms (ENA) an important issue becomes recognizing of transport of these atoms
from the termination shock of the solar wind to Earth orbit.
  Aims: Investigate modifications of energy and of survival probability of the
H ENA detectable by IBEX (0.01 -- 6 keV) between the termination shock and
Earth orbit taking into account the influence of the variable and anisotropic
solar wind and solar EUV radiation.
  Methods: Energy change of the atoms is calculated by numerical simulations of
orbits of the H ENA atoms from ~100 AU from the Sun down to Earth orbit, taking
into account solar gravity and Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation pressure, which is
variable in time and depends on radial velocity of the atom. To calculate
survival probabilities of the atoms against onization, a detailed 3D and
time-dependent model of H ENA ionization based on observations of the solar
wind and EUV ionizing radiation is constructed, and wth the use of this model
probabilities of survival of the atoms are calculated by numerical integration
along the previously calculated orbits.
  Results: Owing to the radiation pressure, H ENA reach the Earth orbit
practically without energy and direction change except the atoms with energy
lower than 0.1 keV during high solar activity. For a given energy at Earth
orbit one expects fluctuations of survival probability from ~20% at 0.01 keV
down to just a few percent at 6 keV and a modulation of survival probability as
a function of the location at Earth orbit, ecliptic latitude of the arrival
direction, and the phase of solar cycle with an amplitude of a few dozen
percent for 0.1 keV atoms at solar minimum to a few percent for 6 keV atoms at
solar maximum.

redshift information of both type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNe in GOODS and
SDF, as well as SN Ia rate densities reported in the literature. Furthermore,
we also add 157 SN candidates in the past Subaru/Suprime-Cam data that are
newly reported here, to increase the statistics. We find that the current data
set of SN rate density evolution already gives a meaningful constraint on the
evolution of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at z <~ 1, though strong
constraints cannot be derived for the delay time distribution (DTD) of SNe Ia.
We derive a constraint of the evolutionary index of SFR density alpha ~ 3--4
[(1+z)^alpha at z <~ 1] with an evidence for a significant evolution of mean
extinction of CC SNe [E(B-V) ~ 0.5 at z ~ 0.5 compared with ~ 0.2 at z = 0],
which does not change significantly within a reasonable range of various DTD
models. This result is nicely consistent with the systematic trend of alpha
estimates based on galactic SFR indicators in different wavelengths
(ultraviolet, H_alpha, and infrared), indicating that there is a strong
evolution in mean extinction of star forming regions in galaxies at relatively
low redshift range of z <~ 0.5. These results are obtained by a method that is
completely independent of galaxy surveys, and especially, there is no detection
limit about the host galaxy luminosity in our analysis, giving a strong
constraint on the star formation activity in high-z dwarf galaxies or

of scaling is expressed in a strictly mathematical manner employing dimensional
pi-invariants analysis sometimes called Buckingham's pi-theorem. It is shown
that in the case of the classical radiation law of Rayleigh and Jeans only one

Consequently, a universal function is established that is indispensable to
avoid the so-called Rayleigh-Jeans catastrophe in the ultraviolet.
Unfortunately, such a universal function cannot be inferred from dimensional
arguments. It has to be derived theoretically or/and empirically, too. It is
shown that such a similarity function can be deduced on the basis of heuristic

The spectrum depends on the strength of this potential and on a dimensionless

semiconducting nanotube is reduced by an arbitrarily weak helical potential,
and for a given field strength there is an optimal P which produces the biggest
change in the band gap. For metallic nanotubes the Fermi velocity is reduced by
this potential and for strong fields two small gaps appear at the Fermi surface
in addition to the gapless Dirac point. A simple model is developed to estimate
the magnitude of the field strength and its effect on DNA-CNT complexes in an

hypothesis under a functional linear model. The test statistic is constructed
as a weighted sum of squared linear combinations of Fourier coefficients, a
tapered quadratic form, in which higher Fourier frequencies are down-weighted
so as to emphasize the smooth attributes of the model. A formula is
$Q_n^{OPT}=n\sum_{j=1}^{p_n}j^{-1/2}\|\boldsymbol{Y}_{n,j}\|^2$. Down-weighting
by $j^{-1/2}$ is selected to achieve adaptive optimality among tests based on
tapering with respect to its ``rates of testing,'' an asymptotic framework for
measuring a test's retention of power in high dimensions under smoothness
constraints. Existing tests based on truncation or thresholding are known to
have superior asymptotic power in comparison with any test based on tapering;
however, it is shown here that high-order effects can be substantial, and that
a test based on $Q_n^{OPT}$ exhibits better (non-asymptotic) power against the
sort of alternatives that would typically be of concern in functional data
analysis applications. The proposed test is developed for use in practice, and
demonstrated in an example application.

decay is obtained in terms of the variance, and in the limiting case (when the
variance becomes so small that the Gaussian is its own Fourier transform),
Hardy's theorem on Fourier transform pairs is obtained. A quantitative result
on the confinement of particle-like states of a quantum harmonic oscillator is
obtained. A stronger form of the result is conjectured. Further, it is shown
how Hardy's theorem may be derived from a weak version of confinement without

stars (TTSs). For consideration we choose the disk wind model described by
Garcia et al. (2001), where a gas component of the wind is heated by an
ambipolar diffusion up to the temperature of the order of 10$^4$ K. It is shown
that the dust grains heating due to collisions with the gas atoms and electrons
is inefficient in comparison with heating by the stellar radiation, and thus,
dust survives even in the hot wind component. Owing to this, the disk wind may
be opaque for the ultraviolet and optical radiation of the star and is capable
to absorb its noticeable fraction. Calculations show that at the accretion rate
$\dot{M_a} = 10^{-8}-10^{-6} M_\odot$ per year this fraction for TTSs may range
from 20% to 40% of a total luminosity of the star correspondingly. This means
that the disk wind in TTSs can play the same role as the puffed inner rim
considered in the modern models of accretion disks. In Herbig Ae stars (HAEs)
inner regions of the disk winds ($r \le 0.5$ AU) are free of dust since there
dust grains sublimate under the effect of the radiation of the star. Therefore,
in this case a fraction of the absorbed radiation by the disk wind is
significantly less, and may be compared with the effect of the ""puffed-up inner
rim"" only at $\dot{M_a} \geq 10^{-6} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Due to the structural
inhomogeneity of the disk wind its optical depth towards an observer may be
variable resulting in the photometric activity of the young stars. For the same
reason, one can observe moving shadows from the gas and dust streams with the
spiral-like structure on the highly resolved circumstellar disk images.

RGE analysis at one-loop level utilizing critical couplings concepts implying
divergence of scalar coupling at MG. These are found to be consistent with
finiteness over the entire range MZ<=sqrt(s)<=MG. For completeness, the similar

dependence on height using the profile of the the IR-triplet Ca II line at

stratified, being usually overabundant by 1.0-1.5 dex below log tau_5000 ~ -1,
and strongly depleted above log tau_5000 = -1.5. The IR-triplet Ca II line at
lambda 8498 A reveals a significant contribution of the heavy isotopes 46Ca and
48Ca, which represent less than 1% of the terrestrial Ca isotopic mixture. We
confirm our previous finding that the presence of heavy Ca isotopes is
generally anticorrelated with the magnetic field strength. Moreover, we
discover that in Ap stars with relatively small surface magnetic fields (<=4-5
kG), the light isotope 40Ca is concentrated close to the photosphere, while the
heavy isotopes are dominant in the outer atmospheric layers. This vertical
isotopic separation, observed for the first time for any metal in a stellar
atmosphere, disappears in stars with magnetic field strength above 6-7 kG. We
suggest that the overall Ca stratification and depth-dependent isotopic anomaly
observed in Ap stars may be attributed to a combined action of the
radiatively-driven diffusion and light-induced drift.

are that the presence of self-gravity modifies the slopes of the core mass
function (CMF) at the high mass end. At low thresholds, the slope is shallower
than the one predicted by pure turbulent fragmentation. The shallowness of the
slope is due to the effects of core coalescence and gas accretion. Most
importantly, the slope of the CMF at the high mass end steepens when cores are
selected at higher density thresholds, or alternatively, if the CMF is fitted
with a log-normal function, the width of the lognormal distribution decreases
with increasing threshold. This is due to the fact that gravity plays a more
important role in denser structures selected at higher density threshold and
leads to the conclusion that the role of gravity is essential in generating a
CMF that bears more resemblance with the IMF when cores are selected with an
increasing density threshold in the observations.

evidence for dark matter satellites predicted by simulations of hierarchical
merging in cold dark matter cosmogonies. We show that the fraction of quads
with anomalous flux ratios depends primarily on the total mass and spatial
extent of the satellites, and the characteristic lengthscale R of their
distribution. If R is 100 kpc, then for a moderately elliptical galaxy with a
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 250 km/s, a mass of 3 x 10^9 solar masses
in highly-concentrated (Plummer model) satellites is needed for 20% of
quadruplets to show anomalous flux ratios, rising to 1.25 x 10^10 solar masses
for 50%. Several times these masses are required if the satellites have more
extended Hernquist profiles. Compared to a typical elliptical, the flux ratios
of quads formed by typical edge-on disc galaxies with maximum discs are
significantly less susceptible to changes through substructure -- three times
the mass in satellite galaxies is needed to affect 50% of the systems. In many
of the lens systems with anomalous flux ratios, there is evidence for visible
satellites (e.g., B2045+265 or MG0414+0534). We show that optically identified
substructure should not be preponderant among lens systems with anomalies.
There are two possible resolutions of this difficulty. First, in some cases,
visible substructure may be projected within or close to the Einstein radius
and wrongly ascribed as the culprit, whereas dark matter substructure is
causing the flux anomaly. Second, bright satellites, in which baryon cooling
and condensation has taken place, may have higher central densities than dark
satellites, rendering them more efficient at causing flux anomalies.

epidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range
transportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks.
The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an
important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.
Methods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that
incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220
countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of
country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by
the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of
robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread
of the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model,
the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease
parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from
empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is
evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in
agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusions:
The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range
mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power
that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational
strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and
forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of
containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic
outbreaks.

more than 650 separate nights, distributed over 6 years and covering the
descent from maximum to minimum of sunspot cycle n.23. Additionally, a set of
about 1,000 low resolution, optical night-sky spectra have been extracted and
analyzed. The unprecedented database discussed in this paper has led to the
detection of a clear seasonal variation of the broad band night sky brightness
in the VRI passbands, similar to the well known semi-annual oscillation of the
NaI D doublet. The spectroscopic data demonstrate that this seasonality is
common to all spectral features, with the remarkable exception of the OH
rotational-vibrational bands. A clear dependency on the solar activity is
detected in all passbands and it is particularly pronounced in the U band,
where the sky brightness decreased by about 0.6 mag arcsec-2 from maximum to
minimum of solar cycle n.23. No correlation is found between solar activity and
the intensity of the NaI D doublet and the OH bands. A strong correlation
between the intensity of NI 5200A and [OI]6300,6364A is reported here for the

general contain inhomogeneity and local magnetic moments. In deriving
renormalization formulae, we also derive or estimate terms of higher powers of
intersite contractions neglected in the conventional GA. We examine several
different constraints, i.e., local/global spin-dependent/independent
particle-number conservation. Out of the four, the local spin-dependent
constraint seems the most promising at present. An improved GA derived from it
agrees with the variational Monte Carlo method better than the conventional GA
does. The corrections to the conventional GA can be interpreted as two-site
correlation including the phase difference of configurations. Furthermore,
projected quasi-particle excited states are orthogonal to each other within the
GA. Using these states, spectral weights are calculated. We show that asymmetry
between electron addition and removal spectra can appear by taking into account
the higher powers of the intersite contractions in the case of the d-wave
superconductors and the Fermi sea; the addition is smaller than the removal.
However, the asymmetry is quite weak especially near the Fermi level. In
contrast, projected s-wave superconductors can have the opposite asymmetry
(addition larger than removal) especially near the Fermi level. In addition,
formulae from the other three constraints are also derived, which may be useful
depending on purposes.

differences among the recovered parameters and the input ones. Results indicate
that the stellar masses measured by means of optical bands are affected by
larger uncertainties with respect to those obtained from near-IR bands, and
they frequently underestimate the real values. The M/L ratio in the V band
results strongly underestimated, even when derived from the recently proposed
recipe based on rest-frame optical colours (e.g. (B-V)).

of algebraic varieties provides more information on the structure of
singularities there is evidence that the weaker concept is enough for many
computational purposes. We give a detailed study of the Jung method and show
how it facilitates an efficient computation of formal desingularizations for
projective surfaces over a field of characteristic zero, not necessarily

rational Puiseux parametrizations to the multivariate case and a detailed

of the magnetic induction during cooling in thin-film YBCO strips for strip
widths W from 2 to 50 um. We found that vortices were excluded from the strips
when the induction Ba was below a critical induction Bc. We present a simple
model for the vortex exclusion process which takes into account the vortex -
antivortex pair production energy as well as the vortex Meissner and
self-energies. This model predicts that the real density n of trapped vortices
is given by n=(Ba-BK)/Phi0 with BK = 1.65Phi0/W^2 and Phi0 = h/2e the
superconducting flux quantum. This prediction is in good agreement with our
experiments on YBCO, as well as with previous experiments on thin-film strips
of niobium. We also report on the positions of the trapped vortices. We found
that at low densities the vortices were trapped in a single row near the
centers of the strips, with the relative intervortex spacing distribution width
decreasing as the vortex density increased, a sign of longitudinal ordering.
The critical induction for two rows forming in the 35 um wide strip was (2.89 +
1.91-0.93)Bc, consistent with a numerical prediction.

significant, but no orbital motion was detected. Faint luminosity, low gravity,
and a late-M/early-L spectral type indicated that the companion is either a
planet or a brown dwarf. We have monitored GQ Lup and its companion in order to
detect orbital and parallactic motion and variability in its brightness. We
also search for closer and fainter companions. We have taken six more images
with the VLT Adaptive Optics instrument NACO from May 2005 to Feb 2007, always
with the same calibration binary from Hipparcos for both astrometric and
photometric calibration. By adding up all the images taken so far, we search
for additional companions. The position of GQ Lup A and its companion compared
to a nearby non-moving background object varies as expected for parallactic
motion by about one pixel (2 \pi with parallax \pi). We could not find evidence
for variability of the GQ Lup companion in the K-band (standard deviation being
\pm 0.08 mag), which may be due to large error bars. No additional companions
are found with deep imaging. There is now exceedingly high significance for
common proper motion of GQ Lup A and its companion. In addition, we see for the
first time an indication for orbital motion (about 2 to 3 mas/yr decrease in
separation, but no significant change in the position angle), consistent with a
near edge-on or highly eccentric orbit. We measured the parallax for GQ Lup A
to be \pi = 6.4 \pm 1.9 mas (i.e. 156 \pm 50 pc) and for the GQ Lup companion
to be 7.2 \pm 2.1 mas (i.e. 139 \pm 45 pc), both consistent with being in the

bounded harmonic functions to solutions of more general equations. We deal with
entire solutions of periodic and almost periodic parabolic equations including
the elliptic framework as a particular case. We derive a Liouville type result
for periodic operators as a consequence of a result for operators periodic in
just one variable, which is new even in the elliptic case. More precisely, we
show that if $c\leq0$ and $a_{ij}, b_i, c, f$ are periodic in the same
space/time direction, with the same period, then any bounded solution $u$ of
$$\partial_t
u-a_{ij}(x,t)\partial_{ij}u-b_i(x,t)\partial_iu-c(x,t)u=f(x,t),\quad x\in\R^N,\
t\in\R,$$ is periodic in that direction. We then derive the following Liouville
type result: if $c\leq0, f\equiv0$ and $a_{ij}, b_i, c$ are periodic in all the
space/time variables, with the same periods, then the space of bounded
solutions of the above equation has at most dimension one. In the case of the
equation $\partial_t u-Lu=f(x,t)$, with $L$ periodic elliptic operator
independent of $t$, the hypothesis $c\leq0$ can be weaken by requiring that the
periodic principal eigenvalue of $-L$ is nonnegative. Instead, the periodicity
assumption cannot be relaxed, because we explicitly exhibit an almost periodic
function $b$ such that the space of bounded solutions of $u''+b(x)u'=0$ in $\R$
has dimension 2, and it is generated by the constant solution and a non-almost
periodic solution. Next, a sufficient condition for any bounded solution to be
almost periodicis derived. We also treat the case of periodic domains under
either Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions.

observations; 194 of them are members of the cluster. Stars of all spectral
types, from the early-types to the late-M dwarfs, were detected. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to the X-ray photon time series shows that, on
short time scales, only a relatively small fraction (ranging from 6% to 31% for
dG and dF, respectively) of the members of NGC2516 are variable with a
confidence level $\geq$99%; however, it is possible that the fraction is small
only because of the poor statistics. The time X-ray amplitude distribution
functions (XAD) of a set of dF7-dK2 stars, derived on short (hours) and medium
(months) time scales, seem to suggest that medium-term variations, if present,
have a much smaller amplitude than those on short time scales; a similar result
is also obtained for dK3-dM stars. The amplitude variations of late-type stars
in NGC2516 are consistent with those of the coeval Pleiades stars. Comparing
these data with those of ROSAT/PSPC, collected 7-8 years earlier, and of

constant $\Lambda_b$ which multiplies the nonsymmetric fundamental tensor, such
that the total $\Lambda=\Lambda_z+\Lambda_b$ matches measurement. The resulting
theory becomes exactly Einstein-Maxwell theory in the limit as
$|\Lambda_z|\to\infty$. For $|\Lambda_z|\sim 1/(Planck length)^2$ the field
equations match the ordinary Einstein and Maxwell equations except for extra
terms which are $<10^{-16}$ of the usual terms for worst-case field strengths
and rates-of-change accessible to measurement. Additional fields can be
included in the Lagrangian, and these fields may couple to the symmetric metric
and the electromagnetic vector potential, just as in Einstein-Maxwell theory.
The ordinary Lorentz force equation is obtained by taking the divergence of the
Einstein equations when sources are included. The Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann
(EIH) equations of motion match the equations of motion for Einstein-Maxwell
theory to Newtonian/Coulombian order, which proves the existence of a Lorentz
force without requiring sources. This fixes a problem of the original
Einstein-Schrodinger theory, which failed to predict a Lorentz force. An exact
charged solution matches the Reissner-Nordstrom solution except for additional
terms which are $\sim 10^{-66}$ of the usual terms for worst-case radii
accessible to measurement. An exact electromagnetic plane-wave solution is
identical to its counterpart in Einstein-Maxwell theory.

Based on the present ab initio results, and by comparison with previous
calculations, we propose a physical real-space interpretation of the several
contributions to the screening. Combining the Thomas-Fermi theory and simple
electrostatics, we show that it is possible to construct a model screening
function that has the merit of being of simple physical interpretation. The
main point upon which the model is based is that, up to distances of the order
of a bond length from the perturbation, the charge response does not depend on
the nanocrystal size. We show in a very clear way that the link between the
screening at the nanoscale and in the bulk is given by the surface
polarization. A detailed discussion is devoted to the importance of local field
effects in the screening. Our first-principles calculations and the
Thomas-Fermi theory clearly show that in Si and Ge nanocrystals, local field
effects are dominated by surface polarization, which causes a reduction of the
screening in going from the bulk down to the nanoscale. Finally, the model
screening function is compared with recent state-of-the-art ab initio
calculations and tested with impurity activation energies.
