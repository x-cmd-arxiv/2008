the emergence from M5's of the scalar potential describing certain type IIB
flux configurations [arXiv:0705.0983]. We then construct exact nonholomorphic
M5 configurations in the special case of SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory deformed
by a degree six superpotential which correspond to the recently discovered
metastable vacua of Ooguri, Ookouchi, Park [arXiv:0704.3613], and Pastras
[arXiv:0705.0505]. These solutions take the approximate form of a holomorphic
Seiberg-Witten geometry with harmonic embedding along a transverse direction
and allow us to obtain geometric intuition for local stability of the gauge
theory vacua. As usual, dynamical processes in the gauge theory, such as the
decay of nonsupersymmetric vacua, take on a different character in the M5
description which, due to issues of boundary conditions, typically involves
runaway behavior in MQCD.

for large scale non-thermal radio emission at these frequencies; the spectral
behavior is likely determined by the complex summation of multiple HII region
components with a wide range of emission measures and hence radio turn-over
frequencies. Also, we discuss a possible additional interpretation of the radio
continuum spectrum of individual component Sgr B2-F carried out by Yusef-Zadeh

frequencies may contribute to the the change in slope of the radio continuum in
this direction at low frequencies. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties in the
determination of the spectral index of the GBT continuum data of Sgr B carried
out by Hollis et al. We find that the apparent spectral index determined by
their procedure is also likely due to a summation over the many diverse thermal

system for understanding the effects of disorder in magnets. Since the late
1970s, there has been a particular focus on realizations of the RFIM in
site-diluted antiferromagnets. We observe random-field effects in the dilute
dipole-coupled ferromagnet $\mathrm{LiHo}_x\mathrm{Y}_{1-x}\mathrm{F}_4$. In
the presence of a magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis ($H_t$), the
behavior of $\mathrm{LiHo}_x\mathrm{Y}_{1-x}\mathrm{F}_4$ becomes increasingly
dominated by the influence of random-field terms in the effective Hamiltonian.
This is seen experimentally in the shape of the ferromagentic-paramagnetic
phase boundary and in changes to the critical exponents near the classical
critical point. We find that above the classical critical point the magnetic
susceptibility diverges as $H_t\to0$, and that the susceptibility both above
and below the classical critical point can be collapsed onto a single universal
curve using a modified Curie law which explicitly incorporates random-field
contributions. The discovery of a ferromagnetic realization of the RFIM opens
the door to investigation of the random-field problem with the wide variety of
techniques available for probing ferromagnets, including the ability to examine
both the statics and dynamics of the random-field problem. It also allows
studying the effects of controlled amounts of randomness on the dynamics of

very recent experimental results, such as the unusual lobe-type structure in
the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, phase rigidity, and the asymmetry
of the visibility as a function of transparencies of quantum point contacts.
According to our model, dephasing in the interferometer originates from strong
Coulomb interaction at the edge of two-dimensional electron gas. The long-range
character of the interaction leads to a separation of the spectrum of edge
excitations on slow and fast mode. These modes are excited by electron
tunneling and carry away the phase information. The new energy scale associated
with the slow mode determines the temperature dependence of the visibility and
the period of its oscillations as a function of voltage bias. Moreover, the
variation of the lobe structure from one experiment to another is explained by
specific charging effects, which are different in all experiments. We propose
to use a strongly asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one arm being
much shorter than the other for the spectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.

be caused by the interaction of the bosons with impurity atoms having a large

random on-site energies which have a discrete binary probability distribution.
The phase diagram at zero temperature is calculated using several methods like
a strong-coupling expansion, an exact numerical diagonalization, and a
Bose-Fermi mapping valid in the hard-core limit. It is shown that the
Mott-insulator phase exists for any strength of disorder in contrast to the

Furthermore, we evaluate experimentally accessible quantities like the momentum

packets of real atoms, and the physical scale probed in DPD models are
determined by the mapping of DPD variables to the corresponding physical
quantities. However, the non-uniqueness of such mapping has led to difficulties
in setting up simulations to mimic real systems and in interpreting results.
For modeling transport phenomena where thermal fluctuations are important
(e.g., fluctuating hydrodynamics), an area particularly suited for DPD method,
we propose that DPD fluid particles should be viewed as only 1) to provide a
medium in which the momentum and energy are transferred according to the
hydrodynamic laws and 2) to provide objects immersed in the DPD fluids the
proper random ""kicks"" such that these objects exhibit correct fluctuation
behaviors at the macroscopic scale. We show that, in such a case, the choice of
system temperature and mapping of DPD scales to physical scales are uniquely
determined by the level of coarse-graining and properties of DPD fluids. We
also verified that DPD simulation can reproduce the macroscopic effects of
thermal fluctuation in particulate suspension by showing that the Brownian

dispersion in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent wall-bounded flows is
addressed. We run Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for turbulent channel flow
at shear Reynolds numbers equal to 150 and 300 and corresponding a-priori and
a-posteriori LES on differently coarse grids. We then tracked swarms of
different inertia particles and we examined the influence of filtering and of
Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) modeling for the fluid phase on particle velocity and
concentration statistics. We also focused on how particle preferential
segregation is predicted by LES. Results show that even ``well-resolved'' LES
is unable to reproduce the physics as demonstrated by DNS, both for particle
accumulation at the wall and for particle preferential segregation. Inaccurate
prediction is observed for the entire range of particles considered in this
study, even when the particle response time is much larger than the flow
timescales not resolved in LES. Both a-priori and a-posteriori tests indicate
that recovering the level of fluid and particle velocity fluctuations is not
enough to have accurate prediction of near-wall accumulation and local
segregation. This may suggest that reintroducing the correct amount of
higher-order moments of the velocity fluctuations is also a key point for SGS
closure models for the particle equation. Another important issue is the
presence of possible flow Reynolds number effects on particle dispersion. Our
results show that, in small Reynolds number turbulence and in the case of heavy
particles, the shear fluid velocity is a suitable scaling parameter to quantify
these effects.

that could host weather-like phenomena. The detection of photometric or
spectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmospheric
heterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.
  Aims: It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global cloud
deck may account for the L- to T-type transition as brown dwarf photospheres
evolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a mechanism is compatible with
variability. We searched for variability in the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown
dwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.
  Methods: We obtained spectroscopic time series using VLT/ISAAC, over
0.99-1.13um, and IRTF/SpeX for two of our targets, in J, H and K bands. We
search for statistically variable lines and correlation between those.
  Results: High spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, but
these detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. We find no evidence for
large amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upper
limits of 2 to 3% on broad-band variability, on the time scale of a few hours.
The T2 transition brown dwarf SDSS J1254-0122 shows numerous variable features,
but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations.
  Conclusions: Assuming that any variability arises from the rotation of
patterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we find
that the typical physical scale of cloud cover disruption should be smaller
than 5-8% of the disk area for four of our targets. The possible variations
seen in SDSS J1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloud
breaking hypothesis.

is due to stochastic fluctuations in the number of bright stars residing in
low-mass clusters. We use 54 clusters with the most reliable age and
metallicity estimates as test particles to evaluate the performance of four
widely used SSP models in the optical/NIR colour-colour space. All models
reproduce the reddening-corrected colours of the old (>10 Gyr) globular
clusters quite well, but model performance varies at younger ages. In order to
account for the effects of stochastic fluctuations in individual clusters, we
provide composite B-V, B-J, V-J, V-Ks and J-Ks colours for Magellanic Cloud
clusters in several different age intervals. The accumulated mass for most
composite clusters are higher than that needed to keep luminosity variations
due to stochastic fluctuations below the 10% level. The colours of the
composite clusters are clearly distinct in optical-NIR colour-colour space for
the following intervals of age: >10 Gyr, 2-9 Gyr, 1-2 Gyr, and 200 Myr-1 Gyr.

Although the behavior of the main outburst (velocity, outburst magnitude, and

previous findings from studies of individual lines of sight, but are at odds
with expectations for a WHIM origin. At least half of the absorbers can be
explained by a simple photoionization model. In addition, in some absorbers we
find evidence for large variation in gas density/metallicity across components

further show that under the assumption of the gas being photoionized by the

  figures available on request",,"10.1086/529537",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new XMM-Newton spectrum of the Seyfert 2 nucleus of IC 2560,
which hosts H$_{2}$O maser emission from an inclined Keplerian accretion disk.
The X-ray spectrum shows soft excess due to multi-temperature ionized plasma, a
hard continuum and strong emission features, from Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe and Ni,
mainly due to fluorescence. It is consistent with reflection of the continuum
from a mostly neutral medium and obscuration due to a high column density, $>$
10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The amplitude of the reflected component may exceed 10% of
the central unobscured luminosity. This is higher than the reflected fraction,
of a few percent, observed in other Seyfert 2 sources like NGC 4945. We observe
an emission line at 6.7 keV, possibly due to FeXXV, undetected in previous
Chandra observations. The absorption column density associated with this line
is less than 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, lower than the obscuration of the central
source. We hypothesize that this highly ionized Fe line emission originates in
warm gas, also responsible for a scattered component of continuum emission that
may dominate the spectrum between 1 and 3 keV. We compare X-ray and maser
emission characteristics of IC 2560 and other AGN that exhibit water maser
emission originating in disk structures around central engines. The temperature
for the region of the disk associated with maser action is consistent with the
expected 400-1000K range. The clumpiness of disk structures (inferred from the

the dependence of the ratio of optical/UV flux to X-ray flux, alpha_ox, and the
X-ray photon index, Gamma_X, on black hole mass, UV luminosity relative to
Eddington, and X-ray luminosity relative to Eddington. Our sample is drawn from
the SDSS, with X-ray data from ROSAT and Chandra, and optical data mostly from
the SDSS; 153 of these sources have estimates of Gamma_X from Chandra. We
estimate M_BH using standard estimates derived from the Hbeta, Mg II, and C IV
broad emission lines. Our sample spans a broad range in black hole mass (10^6 <
M_BH / M_Sun < 10^10) and redshift (z < 4.8). We find that alpha_ox increases
with increasing M_BH and L_UV / L_Edd, and decreases with increasing L_X /
L_Edd. In addition, we confirm the correlation seen in previous studies between
Gamma_X and M_BH and both L_UV / L_Edd and L_X / L_Edd; however, we also find
evidence that the dependence of Gamma_X of these quantities is not monotonic,
changing sign at M_BH ~ 3 x 10^8 M_Sun. We argue that the alpha_ox correlations
imply that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the accretion disk,
as compared to the corona, increases with increasing accretion rate relative to
Eddington. In addition, we argue that the Gamma_X trends are caused by a
dependence of X-ray spectral index on accretion rate. We discuss our results
within the context of accretion models with comptonizing corona, and discuss
the implications of the alpha_ox correlations for quasar feedback. To date,
this is the largest study of the dependence of RQQ X-ray parameters on black
hole mass and related quantities, and the first to attempt to correct for the
large statistical uncertainty in the broad line mass estimates.

place an upper limit on the space and stellar mass density of candidate massive

constraints given by the transversely connected galaxies in a group, based on
the assumption that all galaxies in a group have the same redshift. Tests using
the Virgo Consortium Millennium Simulation mock catalogs allow us to show that
the recovery rate of the pFoF algorithm is larger than 80% for mock groups of
at least $2\times10^{13}M_{\sun}$, while the false detection rate is about 10%
for pFoF groups containing at least $\sim8$ net members. Applying the algorithm

Conflict nets are a variant of (and were inspired by) combinatorial proofs

(MSE) quantization of R^n is important in a number of problems, notably
dirty-paper coding. For this purpose, we start with a binary low-density
generator-matrix (LDGM) code, and construct the quantization codebook by
periodically repeating its set of binary codewords, or them mapped to m-ary
ones with Gray mapping. The quantization algorithm is based on belief
propagation, and it uses a decimation procedure to do the guessing necessary
for convergence. Using the results of a true typical decimator (TTD) as
reference, it is shown that the asymptotic performance of the proposed
quantizer can be characterized by certain monotonicity conditions on the code's
fixed point properties, which can be analyzed with density evolution, and
degree distribution optimization can be carried out accordingly. When the
number of iterations is finite, the resulting loss is made amenable to analysis
through the introduction of a recovery algorithm from ``bad'' guesses, and the
results of such analysis enable further optimization of the pace of decimation
and the degree distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed
LDGM-based quantizer can achieve a shaping gain of 1.4906 dB, or 0.0423 dB from
the limit, and significantly outperforms trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) at a

entire disc thickness. All the grains have the same radius (a = 0.1, 1 or 3
micron) and constitute 1 % of the total mass of the gas. Solutions are obtained
at R = 5 and 10 AU for a minimum-mass solar nebula model and different choices
of the initially vertical magnetic field strength (B), configuration of the
diffusivity tensor and grain sizes. We find that when no grains are present, or
they are > 1 micron, the midplane remains magnetically coupled for B up to a
few gauss at both radii. In contrast, when a population of small grains (a =
0.1 micron) is present, the disc is magnetically inactive for z/H < 2 and only
B < 50 mG couple to the fluid. At 5 AU, Ohmic diffusion dominates for z/H < 1
when B < a few mG, irrespective of the properties of the grain population.
Conversely, at 10 AU this diffusion term is unimportant in all the scenarios
studied here. For z/H > 5, ambipolar diffusion is severe and prevents the field
from coupling to the gas for all B. Hall diffusion is dominant for a wide range
of field strengths at both radii when dust grains are present. The growth rate,
wavenumber and range of magnetic field strengths for which MRI-unstable modes
exist are all drastically diminished when dust grains are present, particularly
when they are small (a ~ 0.1 micron). We conclude that in protoplanetary discs,
the magnetic field is able to couple to the gas and shear over a wide range of
fluid conditions even when small dust grains are well mixed with the gas.
Despite the low magnetic coupling, MRI modes grow for an extended range of
magnetic field strengths and Hall diffusion largely determines the properties
of the perturbations in the inner regions of the disc (abridged).

  Society of Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/60.sp1.S361",,"astro-ph",,"  We have performed a joint analysis of prompt emission from four bright short
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the Suzaku-WAM and the Konus-Wind experiments.
This joint analysis allows us to investigate the spectral properties of
short-duration bursts over a wider energy band with a higher accuracy. We find
that these bursts have a high E$_{\rm peak}$, around 1 MeV and have a harder
power-law component than that of long GRBs. However, we can not determine
whether these spectra follow the cut-off power-law model or the Band model. We
also investigated the spectral lag, hardness ratio, inferred isotropic
radiation energy and existence of a soft emission hump, in order to classify
them into short or long GRBs using several criteria, in addition to the burst
duration. We find that all criteria, except for the existence of the soft hump,
support the fact that our four GRB samples are correctly classified as
belonging to the short class. In addition, our broad-band analysis revealed
that there is no evidence of GRBs with a very large hardness ratio, as seen in
the BATSE short GRB sample, and that the spectral lag of our four short GRBs is
consistent with zero, even in the MeV energy band, unlike long GRBs. Although
our short GRB samples are still limited, these results suggest that the
spectral hardness of short GRBs might not differ significantly from that of
long GRBs, and also that the spectral lag at high energies could be a strong
criterion for burst classification.

envisioned by Boss (1998). Boss (1998) has suggested that such protoplanets
would form cores through the settling of small grains. We have tested this
suggestion by following the sedimentation of small silicate grains as the
protoplanet contracts and evolves. We find that during the course of the
initial contraction of the protoplanet, which lasts some $4\times 10^5$ years,
even very small (> 1 micron) silicate grains can sediment to create a core both
for convective and non-convective envelopes, although the sedimentation time is
substantially longer if the envelope is convective, and grains are allowed to
be carried back up into the envelope by convection. Grains composed of organic
material will mostly be evaporated before they get to the core region, while
water ice grains will be completely evaporated. These results suggest that if
giant planets are formed via the gravitational instability mechanism, a small
heavy element core can be formed due to sedimentation of grains, but it will be
composed almost entirely of refractory material. Including planetesimal
capture, we find core masses between 1 and 10 M$_{\oplus}$, and a total high-Z
enhancement of ~40 M$_{\oplus}$. The refractories in the envelope will be
mostly water vapor and organic residuals.

solid-like states, or ""jamming transitions"". There is a strong theoretical
foundation for understanding equilibrium phase transitions that involve
solidification, or jamming. Other jamming transitions, such as the glass
transition, are less well-understood. The jamming phase diagram has been
proposed to unify the description of equilibrium phase transitions, the glass
transitions, and other non-equilibrium jamming transitions. As with equilibrium
phase transitions, which can either be first order (discontinuous in a relevant
order parameter) or second order (continuous), one would expect that
generalized jamming transitions can be continuous or discontinuous. In studies
of flow in complex fluids, there is a wide range of evidence for discontinuous
transitions, mostly in the context of shear localization, or shear banding. In
this paper, I review the experimental evidence for discontinuous transitions. I
focus on systems in which there is a discontinuity in the rate of strain
between two, coexisting states: one in which the material is flowing and the
other in which it is solid-like.

we show that the absorptive and dispersive properties of the deformed

approximation. This approach yields the Fr\'echet derivatives of the P -- SV -

comparing, in the time-distance domain, differential seismograms computed from

point forces, it is found that the Fr\'echet derivative approach is remarkably
accurate for small and localized perturbations of the medium properties which
are consistent with the Born approximation requirements. Furthermore, the
first-order formulation appears to be stable at all source-receiver offsets.

Constraints are provided by high resolution R = 45,000, high signal-to-noise
spectra of the three quasars HE0141-3932, HE0429-4091, and HE2243-6031 which we
have obtained from the ESO archive of VLT/UVES. Results are as follows:
  (1) The single-cloud weak Mg II absorption in the three z ~ 1.7 systems is
produced by clouds with ionization parameters of -3.8 < logU < -2.0 and sizes
of 1-100 pc.
  (2) In addition to the low-ionization phase Mg II clouds, all systems need an
additional 1-3 high-ionization phase C IV clouds within 100 km/s of the Mg II
component. The ionization parameters of the C IV phases range from -1.9 < logU
< -1.0, with sizes of tens of parsecs to kiloparsecs.
  (3) Two of the three single-cloud weak Mg II absorbers have near-solar or
super-solar metallicities, if we assume a solar abundance pattern. Although
such large metallicities have been found for z < 1 weak Mg II absorbers, these
are the first high metallicities derived for such systems at higher redshifts.
  (4) Two of the three weak Mg II systems also need additional low-metallicity,
broad Lya absorption lines, offset in velocity from the metal-line absorption,
in order to reproduce the full Lya profile.
  (5) Metallicity in single-cloud weak Mg II systems are more than an order of
magnitude larger than those in Damped Lya systems at z ~ 1.7. In fact, there
appears to be a gradual decrease in metallicity with increasing N(HI), from
these, the most metal-rich Lya forest clouds, to Lyman limit systems, to
sub-DLAs, and finally to the DLAs.

matching for source classes defined by algebraically declining (resp.

captured in cavities. For a given cavity with a certain size, the fundamental
mode has a fixed frequency f which gives the photons a specific ""colour"". The
cavity also has a typical lifetime tau, which results in a finite linewidth
delta f}. If the size of the cavity is changed fast compared to tau, and so
that the frequency change Delta f >> delta f, then it is possible to change the
""colour"" of the captured photons. Here we demonstrate superconducting microwave
cavities, with tunable effective lengths. The tuning is obtained by varying a
Josephson inductance at one end of the cavity. We show tuning by several
hundred linewidths in a time Delta t << tau. Working in the few photon limit,
we show that photons stored in the cavity at one frequency will leak out from
the cavity with the new frequency after the detuning. The characteristics of
the measured devices make them suitable for dynamic coupling of qubits.

  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2008",,,,"cs.IT cs.GT math.IT",,"  This paper considers the maximization of information rates for the Gaussian
frequency-selective interference channel, subject to power and spectral mask
constraints on each link. To derive decentralized solutions that do not require
any cooperation among the users, the optimization problem is formulated as a
static noncooperative game of complete information. To achieve the so-called
Nash equilibria of the game, we propose a new distributed algorithm called
asynchronous iterative waterfilling algorithm. In this algorithm, the users
update their power spectral density in a completely distributed and
asynchronous way: some users may update their power allocation more frequently
than others and they may even use outdated measurements of the received
interference. The proposed algorithm represents a unified framework that
encompasses and generalizes all known iterative waterfilling algorithms, e.g.,
sequential and simultaneous versions. The main result of the paper consists of
a unified set of conditions that guarantee the global converge of the proposed
algorithm to the (unique) Nash equilibrium of the game.

and loops described by one or more equivalent identities has been of interest
to researchers in loop theory in the recent past. A variety of
quasigroups(loops) that are not universal have been found to be isotopic
invariant relative to a special type of isotopism or the other. Presently,
there are two outstanding open problems on universality of loops: semi
automorphic inverse property loops(1999) and Osborn loops(2005). Smarandache
isotopism(S-isotopism) was originally introduced by Vasantha Kandasamy in 2002.
But in this work, the concept is re-restructured in order to make it more
explorable. As a result of this, the theory of Smarandache isotopy inherits the
open problems as highlighted above for isotopy. In this short note, the
question 'Under what type of S-isotopism will a pair of S-quasigroups(S-loops)
form any variety?' is answered by presenting a pair of specially S-isotopic
S-quasigroups(loops) that both belong to the same variety of
S-quasigroups(S-loops). This is important because pairs of specially S-isotopic
S-quasigroups(e.g Smarandache cross inverse property quasigroups) that are of
the same variety are useful for applications(e.g cryptography).

spectrum; then it performs a chi-square minimization fitting procedure versus a
set of synthetic models. The fitting results are used to estimate a number of
physical parameters like the Star Formation History, absolute magnitudes,
stellar mass and their Probability Distribution Functions. User defined models
can be used, but GOSSIP is also able to load models produced by the most

  250, ed. F. Bresolin, P. A. Crowther, & J. Puls (Cambridge Univ. Press)",,"10.1017/S1743921308020358",,"astro-ph",,"  During the course of their evolution, massive stars lose a substantial
fraction of their initial mass, both through steady winds and through
relatively brief eruptions during their Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase.
This talk reviews the dynamical driving of this mass loss, contrasting the
line-driving of steady winds to the potential role of continuum driving for
eruptions during LBV episodes when the star exceeds the Eddington limit. A key
theme is to emphasize the inherent limits that self-shadowing places on
line-driven mass loss rates, whereas continuum driving can in principle drive
mass up to the ""photon-tiring"" limit, for which the energy to lift the wind
becomes equal to the stellar luminosity. We review how the ""porosity"" of a
highly clumped atmosphere can regulate continuum-driven mass loss, but also
discuss recent time-dependent simulations of how base mass flux that exceeds
the tiring limit can lead to flow stagnation and a complex, time-dependent
combination of inflow and outflow regions. A general result is thus that
porosity-mediated continuum driving in super-Eddington phases can explain the
large, near tiring-limit mass loss inferred for LBV giant eruptions.

  welcomed",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn physics.comp-ph",,"  This work addresses synchronization in transient, non-linear stochastic
dynamics corresponding to accesses performed by self-avoiding walks originating
at each node of a complex network. More specifically, the synchronizability of
accesses incoming from other nodes has been considered and quantified in terms
of the entropy of the mean periods of access, being closely associated to the
efficiency of access delivery to each node. The concept of synchronous support
of a node $i$ has also been suggested as corresponding to the nodes which
contribute the most for the synchronization of the accesses to $i$. These
concepts have been applied to the analysis of 6 networks of different types,
leading to markedly smaller synchronizability being obtained for the
Watts-Strogatz and a geographical models. The more uniform synchronizabilities
were identified for the Watts-Strogatz and path-regular structures. Varying
degrees of correlations were found between the synchronizability and the degree
or outward accessibility of the nodes. The synchronous support of a node $i$
has been found to present diverse structure, including nodes which may be near
to $i$, or nodes which are scattered through the network and far away from $i$.
