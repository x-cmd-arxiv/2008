amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity, but only hold if some amplitudes
vanish when two of the momenta are taken to infinity in a particular complex
direction. This is a very surprising property, since individual Feynman
diagrams all diverge at infinite momentum. In this paper we give a simple
physical understanding of amplitudes in this limit, which corresponds to a hard
particle with (complex) light-like momentum moving in a soft background, and
can be conveniently studied using the background field method exploiting
background light-cone gauge. An important role is played by enhanced spin
symmetries at infinite momentum--a single copy of a ""Lorentz"" group for gauge
theory and two copies for gravity--which together with Ward identities give a
systematic expansion for amplitudes at large momentum. We use this to study
tree amplitudes in a wide variety of theories, and in particular demonstrate
that certain pure gauge and gravity amplitudes do vanish at infinity. Thus the
BCFW recursion relations can be used to compute completely general gluon and
graviton tree amplitudes in any number of dimensions. We briefly comment on the
implications of these results for computing massive 4D amplitudes by KK
reduction, as well understanding the unexpected cancelations that have recently
been found in loop-level gravity amplitudes.

Higgs mass, but a specific value of the decay rate holds special significance:
for a very narrow window of parameters, our Universe has not yet decayed but
the current inflationary period can not be future eternal. Determining whether
we are in this window requires exquisite but achievable experimental precision,
with a measurement of the Higgs mass to 0.1 GeV at the LHC, the top mass to 60
MeV at a linear collider, as well as an improved determination of alpha_s by an
order of magnitude on the lattice. If the parameters are observed to lie in
this special range, particle physics will establish that the future of our

inflation, strongly suggesting that eternal inflation is censored by the
fundamental theory. This conclusion could be drawn even more sharply if
metastability with the appropriate decay rate is found in the MSSM, where the
physics governing the instability can be directly probed at the TeV scale.

MHz with 62.5 kHz resolution. The statistic we use is the visibility
correlation function, or equivalently the angular power spectrum C_l. We
present the results obtained from using relatively unsophisticated,
conventional data calibration procedures. We find that even fairly simple
minded calibration allows one to estimate the visibility correlation function
at a given frequency V_2(U,0). From our observations we find that V_2(U,0) is
consistent with foreground model predictions at all angular scales except the
largest ones probed by our observations where the the model predictions are
somewhat in excess. On the other hand the visibility correlation between
different frequencies kappa(U, Delta nu), seems to be much more sensitive to
calibration errors. We find a rapid decline in kappa(U, Delta nu), in contrast
with the prediction of less than 1 % variation across 2.5 MHz. In this case
however, it seems likely that a substantial part of the discrepancy may be due
to limitations of data reduction procedures.

effects of coexisting inhomogeneous orders, including spin stripes, charge
stripes, and modulated d-density-wave. We find that the anti-phase modulated
d-wave superconductor exhibits zero-energy spectral weight, primarily along
extended arcs in momentum space. Concomitantly, a Fermi surface appears and
typically includes both open segments and closed pockets. When weak homogeneous
superconductivity is also present the Fermi surface collapses onto nodal
points. Among them are the nodal points of the homogeneous d-wave
superconductor, but others typically exist at positions which depend on the
details of the modulation and the band structure. Upon increasing the amplitude
of the constant component these additional points move towards the edges of the
reduced Brillouin zone where they eventually disappear. The above signatures
are also manifested in the density of states of the clean, and the disordered
system. While the presence of coexisting orders changes some details of the
spectral function, we find that the evolution of the Fermi-surface and the
distribution of the low-energy spectral weight are largely unaffected by them.

was considered to be very peculiar to cuprates, seems to be a general complex

consider a possible link between dwarf spheroidals and giant ellipticals. From
the analysis of the V vs (B-V) plot, we search for a possible evolutionary link
between dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs).
By means of chemical evolution models combined with a spectro-photometric
model, we study the evolution of six Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(Carina, Draco, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor). The chemical
evolution models, which adopt up-to-date nucleosynthesis from low and
intermediate mass stars as well as nucleosynthesis and energetic feedback from
supernovae type Ia and II, reproduce several observational constraints of these
galaxies, such as abundance ratios versus metallicity and the metallicity
distributions. The proposed scenario for the evolution of these galaxies is
characterised by low star formation rates and high galactic wind efficiencies.
Such a scenario allows us to predict integrated colours and magnitudes which
agree with observations. Our results strongly suggest that the first few Gyrs
of evolution, when the star formation is most active, are crucial to define the
luminosities, colours, and other photometric properties as observed today.
After the star formation epoch, the galactic wind sweeps away a large fraction
of the gas of each galaxy, which then evolves passively. Our results indicate
that it is likely that at a certain stage of their evolution, dSphs and dIrrs
presented similar photometric properties. However, after that phase, they
evolved along different paths, leading them to their currently disparate
properties.

fractions observed in the solar neighbourhood can be reproduced by assuming
that dust destruction depends the condensation temperatures T_c of the
elements. In elliptical galaxies, type Ia SNe are the major dust factories in
the last 10 Gyr. With our models, we successfully reproduce the dust masses
observed in local ellipticals (~10^6 M_sun) by means of recent FIR and SCUBA

component of circumstellar disks. First, km-sized planetesimals form likely via
a combination of sticky collisions, turbulent concentration of solids, and
gravitational collapse from micron-sized dust grains in the thin disk midplane.
Second, planetesimals coalesce to form Moon- to Mars-sized protoplanets, also
called ""planetary embryos"". Finally, full-sized terrestrial planets accrete
from protoplanets and planetesimals. This final stage of accretion lasts about
10-100 Myr and is strongly affected by gravitational perturbations from any gas
giant planets, which are constrained to form more quickly, during the 1-10 Myr
lifetime of the gaseous component of the disk. It is during this final stage
that the bulk compositions and volatile (e.g., water) contents of terrestrial
planets are set, depending on their feeding zones and the amount of radial
mixing that occurs. The main factors that influence terrestrial planet
formation are the mass and surface density profile of the disk, and the
perturbations from giant planets and binary companions if they exist. Simple
accretion models predicts that low-mass stars should form small, dry planets in
their habitable zones. The migration of a giant planet through a disk of rocky
bodies does not completely impede terrestrial planet growth. Rather, ""hot
Jupiter"" systems are likely to also contain exterior, very water-rich
Earth-like planets, and also ""hot Earths"", very close-in rocky planets. Roughly
one third of the known systems of extra-solar (giant) planets could allow a
terrestrial planet to form in the habitable zone.

often constructed with the help of its stabilizer formalism. But there have
been many known examples of nonadditive codes which are beyond the standard

we suggest the other type of Hamiltonian formalism for quantum error correction
code without involving the stabilizer formalism, and explain it by studying the
Shor nine-qubit code and its generalization. In this Hamiltonian formulation,
the unitary evolution operator at a specific time is a unitary basis
transformation matrix from the product basis to the quantum error correction
code. This basis transformation matrix acts as an entangling quantum operator
transforming a separate state to an entangled one, and hence the entanglement
nature of the quantum error correction code can be explicitly shown up.
Furthermore, as it forms a unitary representation of the Artin braid group, the
quantum error correction code can be described by a braiding operator.
Moreover, as the unitary evolution operator is a solution of the quantum
Yang--Baxter equation, the corresponding Hamiltonian model can be explained as
an integrable model in the Yang--Baxter theory. On the other hand, we
generalize the Shor nine-qubit code and articulate a topic called quantum error
correction codes using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states to yield new
nonadditive codes and channel-adapted codes.

environments. In particular, we detect hot gas halos in ~80% of L_K > L_star
galaxies. We do not find a significant difference in the L_K-L_X relation for
detected group and cluster early-type galaxies. However, we detect X-ray
emission from a significantly higher fraction of galaxies brighter than L_star
in groups compared to clusters, indicating that a larger fraction of galaxies
in clusters experience significant stripping of their hot gas. In addition,
group and cluster galaxies appear to be X-ray faint compared to field galaxies,
though a Chandra based field sample is needed to confirm this result. The
near-IR bright late-types galaxies in clusters and groups appear to follow the
L_K-L_X relation for early-type galaxies, while near-IR fainter late-type
galaxies are significantly more X-ray luminous than this relation likely due to
star formation. Finally, we find individual examples of ongoing gas stripping
of group galaxies. One galaxy shows a 40-50 kpc X-ray tail, and two merging
galaxy systems show tidal bridges/tails of X-ray emission. Therefore, stripping
of hot galactic gas through both ram pressure and tidal forces does occur in
groups and clusters, but the frequency or efficiency of such events must be
moderate enough to allow hot gas halos in a large fraction of bright galaxies
to survive even in group and cluster cores.

We use simple characterizations of reionization history and of proposed
telescope designs to investigate how well the two-dimensional convergence power
spectrum, the three-dimensional matter power spectrum, the evolution of the
linear growth function, and the standard cosmological parameters can be
measured from radio data. The power spectra can be measured accurately over a
wide range of wavenumbers at z ~ 2, and the evolution in the cosmic energy
density can be probed from z ~ 0.5 to z ~ 7. This results in a characterization
of the shape of the power spectra (i.e. of the nature of dark matter and of
inflationary structure generation) which is potentially more precise than that
obtained from galaxy lensing surveys. On the other hand, the dark energy
parameters in their conventional parametrization (Omega_Lambda, w_o, w_a) are
somewhat less well constrained by feasible 21 cm lensing surveys than by an
all-sky galaxy lensing survey although a 21 cm surveys might be more powerful
than galaxy surveys for constraining models with ""early"" dark energy. Overall,
the best constraints come from combining surveys of the two types. This results
in extremely tight constraints on dark matter and inflation, and improves
constraints on dark energy, as judged by the standard figure of merit, by more
than an order of magnitude over either survey alone.

surveys find non-circular orbital eccentricities are common, <e>~0.3. Future
surveys for extrasolar planets using the transit technique will also have
sensitivity to detect these longer period planets. Orbital eccentricity affects
the detection of extrasolar planets using the transit technique in two opposing
ways: an enhancement in the probability for the planet to transit near
pericenter and a reduction in the detectability of the transit due to a shorter
transit duration. For an eccentricity distribution matching the currently known
extrasolar planets with P>10 day, the probability for the planet to transit is
~1.25 times higher than the equivalent circular orbit and the average transit
duration is ~0.88 times shorter than the equivalent circular orbit. These two
opposing effects nearly cancel for an idealized field transit survey with
independent photometric measurements that are dominated by Poisson noise. The
net effect is a modest ~4% increase in the transiting planet yield compared to
assuming all planets have circular orbits. When intrinsic variability of the
star or correlated photometric measurements are the dominant source of noise,
the transit detectability is independent of the transit duration. In this case
the transit yield is ~25% higher than that predicted under the assumption of
circular orbits. Since the Kepler search for Earth-sized planets in the
habitable zone of a Solar-type star is limited by intrinsic variability, the
Kepler mission is expected to have a ~25% higher planet yield than that
predicted for circular orbits if the Earth-sized planets have an orbital
eccentricity distribution similar to the currently known Jupiter-mass planets.

specifically to pulsed, phase-mismatched second harmonic generation in a
negative index material having finite length. Using a generic Drude model for
the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, the fundamental and
second harmonic frequencies are tuned so that the respective indices of
refraction are negative for the pump and positive for the second harmonic
signal. A phase-locking mechanism causes part of the second harmonic signal
generated at the entry surface to become trapped and dragged along by the pump
and to refract negatively, even though the index of refraction at the second
harmonic frequency is positive. These circumstances culminate in the creation
of an anomalous state consisting of a forward-moving second harmonic wave
packet that has negative wave vector and momentum density, which in turn leads
to non-specular reflections at intervening material interfaces. The
forward-generated second harmonic signal trapped under the pump pulse
propagates forward, but has all the attributes of a reflected pulse, similar to
its twin counterpart generated at the surface and freely propagating backward
away from the interface. This describes a new state of negative refraction,
associated with nonlinear frequency conversion and parametric processes,
whereby a beam generated at the interface can refract negatively even though
the index of refraction at that wavelength is positive.

brown dwarfs. One of the largest sources of uncertainty in the properties of
the cluster is that the distance is not well known. The directly measured
Hipparcos distance to sigma Ori AB is 350 (+120,-90) pc. On the other hand, the
distance to the Orion OB1b subgroup (of which sigma Ori is thought to be a

half-duplex relay, single-antenna channel with quasi-static fading. The DDF
protocol is well-known and has been analyzed in terms of the
Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) in the infinite block length limit. We
characterize the finite block length DMT and give new explicit code
constructions. The finite block length analysis illuminates a few key aspects
that have been neglected in the previous literature: 1) we show that one
dominating cause of degradation with respect to the infinite block length
regime is the event of decoding error at the relay; 2) we explicitly take into
account the fact that the destination does not generally know a priori the
relay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmit
mode. Both the above problems can be tackled by a careful design of the
decoding algorithm. In particular, we introduce a decision rejection criterion
at the relay based on Forney's decision rule (a variant of the Neyman-Pearson
rule), such that the relay triggers transmission only when its decision is
reliable. Also, we show that a receiver based on the Generalized Likelihood
Ratio Test rule that jointly decodes the relay decision time and the
information message achieves the optimal DMT. Our results show that no cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) for error detection or additional protocol overhead to
communicate the decision time are needed for DDF. Finally, we investigate the
use of minimum mean squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer
(MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding at both the relay and the destination, and show
that it provides near optimal performance at moderate complexity.

study the relationship between total cluster mass and X-ray binary number. This
significant population of X-Ray/IR associations allows us to perform, for the
first time, a statistical study of X-ray point sources and their environments.
We define a quantity, \eta, relating the fraction of X-ray sources per unit
mass as a function of cluster mass in the Antennae. We compute cluster mass by
fitting spectral evolutionary models to K_s luminosity. Considering that this
method depends on cluster age, we use four different age distributions to
explore the effects of cluster age on the value of \eta and find it varies by
less than a factor of four. We find a mean value of \eta for these different
distributions of \eta = 1.7 x 10^-8 M_\sun^-1 with \sigma_\eta = 1.2 x 10^-8
M_\sun^-1. Performing a \chi^2 test, we demonstrate \eta could exhibit a
positive slope, but that it depends on the assumed distribution in cluster
ages. While the estimated uncertainties in \eta are factors of a few, we
believe this is the first estimate made of this quantity to ``order of

  Methods. We divide a full sample of 33 AGNs (O' Neill et al. 2005) into two
sub-samples. The black hole masses of 17 objects in sub-sample 1 were
determined by the reverberation mapping or the stellar velocity dispersion. The
black hole masses of the remaining 16 objects were estimated from the
relationship between broad line region radius and optical luminosity
(sub-sample 2). Then partial correlation analysis, ordinary least squares
regression and K-S tests are performed on the full sample and the sub-samples,
respectively.
  Results. We find that $\sigma_{\rm rms}^2 $ seems to be intrinsically
correlated with the black hole mass in the full sample. However, this seems to
be caused by including the sub-sample 2 into the analysis, which introduces an
extra correlation between the black hole mass and the luminosity and
strengthens any correlation with the black hole mass artificially. Therefore,
the results from the full sample may be misleading. The results from the
sub-sample 1 show that the correlation between $\sigma_{\rm rms}^2 $ and the
X-ray luminosity may be the intrinsic one and therefore the anti-correlation
between $\sigma_{\rm rms}^2 $ and the black hole mass is doubtful.

quantitative trait. The fitness of the organism depends on this quantitative
trait (via a benefit function), the size of the organism, and the number of
somatic cells. This model allows one to determine when somatic cells are
advantageous and to calculate the optimum number (or fraction) of reproductive
cells. I show that the fraction of reproductive cells is always surprisingly
high. If somatic cells are very small they can outnumber reproductive cells but
their biomass is still less than the biomass of reproductive cells. Only for
convex benefit functions can the biomass of somatic cell exceed the biomass of
reproductive cells. I discuss the biology of primitive multicellular organisms

apparent magnetic moment induced by Zn was larger in underdoped

much for further overdoping. This is interpreted in terms of the effect of the
pseudogap on the Zn-induced magnetic behavior, as there is growing evidence
that the pseudogap vanishes quite abruptly at p ~ 0.19 +/- 0.01. From a
detailed analysis of chi(T) data the Zn-induced magnetic contribution was found
to be rather complex and showed non-Curie-like features over a wide range of

from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ (or zero) at a finite and uniform rate. The rate of
quenching is dictated by a characteristic scale given by $\tau$. The density of
kinks produced in these extended models while crossing the quantum critical
points during the quenching process is calculated using a many body
generalization of the Landau-Zener transition theory. The density of kinks in
the final state is found to decay as $\tau^{-1/2}$. In the first model
considered here, the transverse Ising Hamiltonian includes an additional
ferromagnetic three spin interaction term of strength $J_3$. For $J_3<0.5$, the
kink density is found to increase monotonically with $J_3$ whereas it decreases
with $J_3$ for $J_3>0.5$. The point $J_3=0.5$ and the transverse field
$h=-0.5$is multicritical where the density shows a slower decay given by
$\tau^{-1/6}$. We also study the effect of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic
next nearest neighbor (NNN) interactions on the dynamics of TIM under the same
quenching scheme. In a mean field approximation, the transverse Ising
Hamiltonians with NNN interactions are identical to the three spin Hamiltonian.
The NNN interactions non-trivially modifies the dynamical behavior, for example
an antiferromagnetic NNN interactions results to a larger number of kinks in
the final state in comparison to the case when the NNN interaction is
ferromagnetic.

transition in its convergence to stationarity. In 1996, Diaconis surveyed this
phenomenon, and asked how one could recognize its occurrence in families of
finite ergodic Markov chains. In 2004, the third author noted that a necessary
condition for cutoff in a family of reversible chains is that the product of
the mixing-time and spectral-gap tends to infinity, and conjectured that in
many settings, this condition should also be sufficient. Diaconis and
Saloff-Coste (2006) verified this conjecture for continuous-time
birth-and-death chains, started at an endpoint, with convergence measured in
separation. It is natural to ask whether the conjecture holds for these chains
in the more widely used total-variation distance.
  In this work, we confirm the above conjecture for all continuous-time or lazy
discrete-time birth-and-death chains, with convergence measured via
total-variation distance. Namely, if the product of the mixing-time and
spectral-gap tends to infinity, the chains exhibit cutoff at the maximal
hitting time of the stationary distribution median, with a window of at most
the geometric mean between the relaxation-time and mixing-time.
  In addition, we show that for any lazy (or continuous-time) birth-and-death
chain with stationary distribution $\pi$, the separation $1 - p^t(x,y)/\pi(y)$
is maximized when $x,y$ are the endpoints. Together with the above results,
this implies that total-variation cutoff is equivalent to separation cutoff in
any family of such chains.

Boltzmann equation has the usual conserved quantities, it possesses a steady
state with power-like tails for certain random variables. A similar situation
occurs in kinetic models of economy recently considered by two of the authors

in [8]. Uniqueness, asymptotic stability and estimates of overpopulated high
energy tails of the steady profile are derived from the basic property of
contraction/expansion of metrics. For general initial conditions the solutions
of the Boltzmann equation are then proved to converge with computable rate as t
goes to infinity to the steady solution in these distances, which metricizes
the weak convergence of measures. These results show that power-like tails in
Maxwell models are obtained when the point-wise conservation of momentum and/or
energy holds only globally.

the self-enrichment scenario by massive Asymptotic Giant Branch stars may work
for the high metallicity Globular Clusters, after previous works by the same
group showed that the theoretical yields by this class of objects can reproduce
the observed trends among the abundances of some elements, namely the O-Al and
O-Na anticorrelations, at intermediate metallicities, i.e [Fe/H]=-1.3. We find
that the increase in the metallicity favours only a modest decrease of the
luminosity and the temperature at the bottom of the envelope for the same core
mass, and also the efficiency of the third dredge-up is scarcely altered. On
the contrary, differences are found in the yields, due to the different impact
that processes with the same efficiency have on the overall abundance of
envelopes with different metallicities. We expect the same qualitative patterns
as in the intermediate metallicity case, but the slopes of some of the
relationships among the abundances of some elements are different. We compare
the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation for clusters of intermediate metallicity
(Z~0.001) and clusters of metallicity large as in these new models. Although
the observational data are still too scarce, the models are consistent with the
observed trends, provided that only stars of M>5 solar masses contribute to

challenge for solid state theory. Whereas the experience of forty years has
proven density functional theory (DFT) in a suitable, e.g. local approximation
(LDA) to give a satisfactory description in case electronic correlations are
weak, materials with strongly correlated, say d- or f-electrons remain a
challenge. Such materials often exhibit colossal responses to small changes of
external parameters such as pressure, temperature, and magnetic field, and are
therefore most interesting for technical applications.
  Encouraged by the success of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in dealing
with model Hamiltonians for strongly correlated electron systems, physicists
from the bandstructure and many-body communities have joined forces and have
developed a combined LDA+DMFT method for treating materials with strongly
correlated electrons ab initio. As a function of increasing Coulomb
correlations, this new approach yields a weakly correlated metal, a strongly
correlated metal, or a Mott insulator.
  In this paper, we introduce the LDA+DMFT by means of an example, LaMnO_3 .
Results for this material, including the colossal magnetoresistance of doped
manganites are presented. We also discuss advantages and disadvantages of the

that, as in ordinary thermodynamics, relativistic absolute temperature should
be introduced operationally via relativistic Carnot processes. We exhibit the
more implicit or even hidden tacit preassumptions being made and point to a
couple of gaps, errors and inconclusive statements in some of the existing
literature. We show in particular that there is a wide-spread habit to draw
general conclusions from the analysis of too restricted and special
thermodynamic processes, e.g. processes with constant pressure, which is
dangerous and sometimes leads to wrong results. Furthermore, we give a detailed
analysis of the so-called zeroth law of relativistic thermodynamics with the
help of a relativistic Carnot process. We rigorously show that, contrary to
certain statements in the literature, thermodynamic systems at different
relativistic temperatures, moving relative to each other, can thermally stably
coexist provided that their respective temperatures obey a certain functional
relation (given by the Lorentz factor). This implies however that their
respective rest temperatures are the same.

from light-field fluctuation. As discussed in previous works, even if the
fluctuation of the inflaton itself does not generate the curvature perturbation
at the horizon crossing, fluctuation of a light field may induce fluctuation
for the end-line of inflation and this may lead to generation of cosmological
perturbation ``at the end of the inflation''. Our scenario is different from
those that are based on the fluctuations of the boundary of the inflaton
trajectory, as clearly explained in this paper by using the $\delta N$
formalism. In this paper, we will consider the perturbation of the inflaton
velocity that can be induced by a light field other than the inflaton. We also
explain the crucial difference from the standard multi-field inflation model.
We show concrete examples of the modulated inflation scenario in which
non-gaussianity can be generated. We also discuss the running of the
non-gaussianity parameter.

investigate the extinction curves of dust produced by SNe II and PISNe, taking
into account reverse shock destruction induced by collision with ambient
interstellar medium. We find that the extinction curve is sensitive to the
ambient gas density around a SN, since the efficiency of reverse shock
destruction strongly depends on it. The destruction is particularly efficient
for small-sized grains, leading to a flat extinction curve in the optical and
ultraviolet wavelengths. Such a large ambient density as n_H > 1 cm^{-3}
produces too flat an extinction curve to be consistent with the observed
extinction curve for SDSS J104845.05+463718.3 at z=6.2. Although the extinction
curve is highly sensitive to the ambient density, the hypothesis that the dust
is predominantly formed by SNe at z~6 is still allowed by the current
observational constraints. For further quantification, the ambient density
should be obtained by some other methods. Finally we also discuss the
importance of our results for observations of high-z galaxies, stressing a
possibility of flat extinction curves.

fluctuations, and only the spins with stronger intra-sublattice exchange has
non-zero spontaneous magnetization. The $T^*$ transition is a transition
between two spin-ordered phases in contrast to the transition from spin-ordered
state to disordered state ($T_N$-transition). There is no additional symmetry
breaking, and the Goldstone boson has a ferromagnetic dispersion in both
phases. A modified spin-wave theory is developed to describe the two phases.

high accuracy. To this end Population-II Cepheids are used that have been
discovered in the OGLE-II and III surveys. Method: Thirty-nine Pop-II Cepheids
have been monitored on 4 nights spanning 14 days. Light curves have been fitted
using the known periods from the OGLE data to determine the mean K-band
magnitude. It so happens that 37 RR Lyrae stars are in the field-of-views and

period-luminosity relation of Pop-II Cepheids in the K-band is determined, and
the derived slope of -2.24 +- 0.14 is consistent with the value derived by
Matsunaga et al. (2006). Fixing the slope to their more accurate value results
in a zero point, and implies a distance modulus to the GC of 14.51 +- 0.12,

star clusters to massive, dark-matter dominated outcomes of cosmological
simulations. For each type of progenitor and orbit we compare the observable
properties of the remnant after 10 Gyr with those of Bootes observed today. Our
study suggests that the progenitor of Bootes must have been, and remains now,
dark matter dominated. In general our models are unable to reproduce the
observed high velocity dispersion in Bootes without dark matter. Our models do
not support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflate
significantly the internal velocity dispersion. As none of our initially
spherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of Bootes, our results
suggest that the progenitor of Bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening.
Although the focus of the present paper is the Bootes dwarf spheroidal, these
models may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stability
and dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

instance) permanently in the gland for the treatment of localized prostate
cancers, e.g., cT1c-T2a N0 M0 with good prognostic factors. Treatment planning
and seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is
difficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the
gland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive
seeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers.
Since MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst
open MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very
complex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room
with MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with
bi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from
the data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and

process. Patient experiments have shown that using MRI data linked with TRUS
data improves TRUS image segmentation especially regarding the apex and base of

an impact on treatment planning.

Charge Density Wave (CDW). This family indeed exhibits the full range of
phenomena that can be associated to CDW instabilities, from the opening of
large gaps on the best nested parts of Fermi Surface (FS) (up to 0.4eV), to the
existence of residual metallic pockets. ARPES is the best suited technique to
characterize these features, thanks to its unique ability to resolve the
electronic structure in k-space. An additional advantage of RTe3 is that the
band structure can be very accurately described by a simple 2D tight-binding
(TB) model, which allows one to understand and easily reproduce many
characteristics of the CDW. In this paper, we first establish the main features
of the electronic structure, by comparing our ARPES measurements with Linear
Muffin-Tin Orbital band calculations. We use this to define the validity and
limits of the TB model. We then present a complete description of the CDW
properties and, for the first time, of their strong evolution as a function of
R. Using simple models, we are able to reproduce perfectly the evolution of
gaps in k-space, the evolution of the CDW wave vector with R and the shape of
the residual metallic pockets. Finally, we give an estimation of the CDW
interaction parameters and find that the change in the electronic density of
states n(Ef), due to lattice expansion when different R ions are inserted, has
the correct order of magnitude to explain the evolution of the CDW properties.

invariance emerges in the infrared limit, but is explicitly broken in the

microscopic substrate, we show how these modifications naturally lead to
momentum-dependent rainbow metrics. Firstly, we investigate the possibility of
reproducing cosmological particle production in spacetimes emerging from real
Bose gases. We have studied the influence of non-perturbative ultraviolet
corrections in time-dependent analogue spacetimes, leading to
momentum-dependent emergent rainbow spacetimes. Within certain limits the
analogy is sufficiently good to simulate relativistic quantum field theory in
time-dependent classical backgrounds, and the quantum effects are approximately
robust against the model-dependent modifications. Secondly, we analyze how
significantly the particle production process deviates from the common picture.
While very low-energy modes do not see the difference at all, some modes
""re-enter the Hubble horizon"" during the inflationary epoch, and extreme
ultraviolet modes are completely insensitive to the expansion.

relation between the mass of the most massive cluster (M_max) and the number of

most massive clusters it also means that M_max increases linearly with age when
determining M_max in logarithmic age bins. We observe this increase in five out
of the seven galaxies in our sample, suggesting that M_max is determined by the
size of the sample. It also means that massive clusters are very stable against
disruption, in disagreement with the mass independent disruption (MID) model
presented at this conference. For the clusters in M51 and the Antennae galaxies
the size-of-sample prediction breaks down around 10^6 M_sun, suggesting that

activity essentially secured by amateur astronomers equipped with small,
portable equipments. However, the accuracy of the available ephemeris prevents
accurate predictions of the occultation events for objects smaller than ~100
km. Aims: We investigate current limits in predictability and observability of
asteroid occultations, and we study their possible evolution in the future,
when high accuracy asteroid orbits and star positions (such as those expected
from the mission Gaia of the European Space Agency) will be available. Methods:
We use a simple model for asteroid ephemeris uncertainties and numerical
algorithms for estimating the limits imposed by the instruments, assuming
realistic CCD performances and asteroid size distribution, to estimate the
expected occultation rate under different conditions. Results: We show that
high accuracy ephemerides which will be available in the future will extend
toward much smaller asteroids the possibility of observing asteroid
occultations, greatly increasing the number of events and objects involved. A
complete set of size measurements down to ~10 km main belt asteroids could be
obtained in a few years, provided that a small network of ground-based 1m

events produced the dynamical families that we observe. In this work we address
the problem of the origin of shapes of gravitational aggregates, that could
contain signatures of their origin. We use a N-body code to simulate the
collapse of a cloud of fragments, with a variety of initial velocity
distributions and total angular momentum. The fragments are treated as
inhelastic spheres, that rapidly accumulate to form rotating aggregates. The
resulting shapes and rotational properties are compared with theoretical

spheroids) are created via this mechanism. This may provide interesting
constraints on the evolution of asteroid shapes, in particular for those with

simulations, using the symplectic integrator SWIFT, taking into account the
gravitational influence of the star and the planet on massless test particles.
A constant migration rate is assumed for the planet. The effect of planetary
migration on the trapping of particles in mean motion resonances is found to be
very sensitive to the initial eccentricity of the planet and of the
planetesimals. A planetary eccentricity as low as 0.05 is enough to smear out
all the resonant structures, except for the most massive planets. The
planetesimals also initially have to be on orbits with a mean eccentricity of
less than than 0.1 in order to keep the resonant clumps visible. This numerical
work extends previous analytical studies and provides a collection of disk
images that may help in interpreting the observations of structures in debris
disks. Overall, it shows that stringent conditions must be fulfilled to obtain
observable resonant structures in debris disks. Theoretical models of the
origin of planetary migration will therefore have to explain how planetary
systems remain in a suitable configuration to reproduce the observed
structures.

heavy-ion collisions. As shown by the RHIC experiments, particle identification
over a large momentum range is essential to disentangle physics processes,
especially in the intermediate p$_T$ (1 $<p_{T}<5$ GeV/c) region. The novel
design of the High-Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), based on
large surface CsI photocathodes, is able to identify $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$,
$p$ and $\bar{p}$ in the momentum region where bulk medium properties and hard
scatterings interplay. Furthermore, measurement of resonance particles such as
the $\phi \to K^+K^-$ could provide information on the system evolution. The
HMPID layout and segmentation are optimized to study particle correlations at
high momenta describing the early phase and the dynamical evolution of the
collision. At LHC, the increased hard cross section will significantly be
enhanced compared to RHIC. Jet reconstruction via Deterministic Annealing can
address jet quenching and detailed measurements of jet properties. In this
paper, we present these selected topics from the possible HMPID contributions
to the physics goals of LHC.

from a coupled set of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We reproduce asymptotic
freedom in the ultraviolet momentum region and find a coupling of order one at
mid-momenta. In the infrared we find a nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) fixed point
which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding fixed point
in the coupling of the ghost-gluon vertex. This result explains why the
Dyson-Schwinger and the functional renormalization group equations for the two

different. Our findings also support Zwanziger's notion of an infrared
effective theory driven by the Faddeev-Popov determinant.

synthesize the expected O VI 1032A line profile. We explain several spectral
features of the observations like the absence of discontinuities in the O VI
emission during the shock passage, the brightening of Si XII emission and the
width of the lines. We use our model also to give very simple and general
predictions for the strength of the line wings due to the ions shock heating
and on the line shape for Limb CMEs or Halo CMEs. The emission coming from
post-shock region in the solar corona roughly agrees with the emission from a
simple planar and adiabatic shock, but the effect of thermal conduction and the
magnetic field may be important depending on the event parameters. Doppler
dimming significantly influences the O VI emission while Si XII line brightens
mainly because of the shock compression. Significant shock heating is
responsible for the wide and faint component of the O VI line usually observed
which may be taken as a shock signature in the solar corona.

The special case of two OPOs is studied, as it is shown that the resulting five
bright beams share genuine multipartite entanglement. In addition, the
structure of entanglement distribution among the fields can be manipulated to
some degree by tuning the incident pump power. The scalability to many fields
is straightforward, allowing an alternative implementation of a multipartite

that the geoeffectiveness of 229 frontside halo CMEs was 71%. Recently for
observations of 305 frontside halo CMEs during 1997-2003 the geoeffectiveness

conflicting results (geoeffectiveness of CMEs ranging from 35% to more than
