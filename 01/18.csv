temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). It also provides a plausible explanation for the possible disparity
between observations and theoretical fits to the CMB power spectrum. Here we
report on calculations of not only the numerical CMB power spectrum from the
PMF, but also the correlations between the CMB power spectrum from the PMF and
the primary curvature perturbations. We then deduce a precise estimate of the
PMF effect on all modes of perturbations. We find that the PMF affects not only
the CMB TT and TE modes on small angular scales, but also on large angular
scales. The introduction of a PMF leads to a better fit to the CMB power
spectrum for the higher multipoles, and the fit at lowest multipoles can be
used to constrain the correlation of the PMF with the density fluctuations for
large negative values of the spectral index. Our prediction for the BB mode for
a PMF average field strength $|B_\lambda| =4.0$ nG is consistent with the upper
limit on the BB mode deduced from the latest CMB observations. We find that the
BB mode is dominated by the vector mode of the PMF for higher multipoles. We
also show that by fitting the complete power spectrum one can break the
degeneracy between the PMF amplitude and its power spectral index.

proposed so far and point out that they should be distinguished according to

mostly irregular branes have been studied, while results on the regular ones
are rare. For all types of branes, there are questions about how a second
factorization constraint in the form of a b^{-2}/2-shift equation can be
derived. Here, we assume analyticity of the boundary two point function, which
means that the Cardy-Lewellen constraints remain unweakened. This enables us to
derive unambiguously the desired b^{-2}/2-shift equations. They serve as
important additional consistency conditions. For some regular branes, we also
derive 1/2-shift equations that were not known previously. Case by case, we
discuss possible solutions to the enlarged system of constraints. We find that
the well-known irregular continuous AdS_2 branes are consistent with our new
factorization constraint. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a new type
of brane: The shift equations in a certain regular discrete case possess a
non-trivial solution that we write down explicitly. All other types are found
to be inconsistent when using our second constraint. We discuss these results
in view of the Hosomichi-Ribault proposal and some of our earlier results on

cancels the diverging zero point energy of quantum fields. Examples of the
spectral function of the vacuum energy in the condensed-matter systems with

investigate this issue using state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations
of a $t-J$ model. In particular we consider the stability of unidirectional
hole domains in a modulated superconducting background, by taking into account
the effect of tetragonal-lattice distortions, next-nearest neighbor hopping and

  211 Pages, 21 Figures, 1 Table",,,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.other",,"  Low-dimensional systems are an important field of current theoretical and
experimental research. Recent technological developments provide many possible
realizations of effectively one-dimensional systems. These devices promise to
give us access to a new range of phenomena. It is therefore very interesting to
develop theoretical methods specific for such systems to model their behavior
and calculate the correlators of the resulting theory. Incidentally, one such
method exists and is known as Bosonization. It can be applied to
one-dimensional systems and effectively describes low energy excitations in a
universal way. We use the example of a correlator known as the Emptiness
Formation Probability to show that Bosonization fails to describe some long
range correlators corresponding to large disturbances (the EFP measures the
probability for the ground state of the system to develop a region without
particles). We trace this failure to the fact that Bosonization is constructed
as a linear approximation of the full theory and we set up to develop a
collective description with the required non-linearity. The resulting scheme is
essentially a Hydrodynamic paradigm for quantum systems. We show how to
construct such a hydrodynamic description for a variety of exactly integrable
models and illustrate how it can be used to make new predictions. For the
special case of the spin-1/2 XY model we take advantage of the structure of the
model to express the EFP as a determinant of a very special type of matrix,
known as Toeplitz Matrix. We use the theory of Toeplitz determinants to
calculate the asymptotic behavior of the EFP in the XY model and discuss its
relation with the criticality of the theory.

the lowest triplet excitation is found to have a spin gap of approximately
$0.08 \pm 0.02 J$ and a bandwidth of only about $0.01 J$. For the 36-site
cluster, consisting of a single unit cell with periodic boundary conditions,
there are substantial finite-size effects: the spin gap there is estimated to
be approximately $0.2 J$, close to the exact diagonalization result of $0.164
J$. The triplet excitations attract one another and form many bound states in
the spin-singlet channel. We find a large number of such bound states for the
36-site cluster, many of which appear to lie below the spin gap, again in
agreement with the results from exact diagonalization.

condition in which the emitted X-ray energy is supplied by the hadronic cosmic

correlated with the WR pressure distribution and, consequently, with the
non-thermal emission (radio, hard X-ray and gamma-ray) induced by the
interaction of the WRs with the IC gas and magnetic field. The temperature
distribution of the IC gas in both cool-core and non cool-core clusters is
successfully predicted from the measured IC gas density distribution. Under
this contraint, the WR model is also able to reproduce the thermal and
non-thermal pressure distribution in clusters, as well as their radial entropy
distribution. The WR model provides other observable features: a correlation of
the pressure ratio (WRs to thermal IC gas) with the inner cluster temperature
T_{inner}, a correlation of the gamma-ray luminosity with T_{inner}, a
substantial number of cool-core clusters observable with the GLAST-LAT
experiment, a surface brightness of radio halos in cool-core clusters that
recovers the observed one, a hard X-ray emission from cool-core clusters that
is systematically lower than the observed limits and yet observable with the
next generation HXR experiments like Simbol-X. The specific theoretical
properties and the multi-frequency distribution of the e.m. signals predicted

  Multi-wavelength ground-based and space-borne observations are used to study
a fast W-limb CME event of December 2, 2003, taking into account both on and
off disk observations. Its erupting prominence is measured at high cadence with
the Pic du Midi full H-alpha line-flux imaging coronagraph. EUV images from
space instruments are processed including difference imaging. SOHO/LASCO images
are used to study the mass excess and motions. A fast bright expanding coronal
loop is identified in the region recorded slightly later by GOES as a C7.2
flare, followed by a brightening and an acceleration phase of the erupting
material with both cool and hot components. The total coronal radiative flux
dropped by 5 percent in the EUV channels, revealing a large dimming effect at
and above the limb. The typical 3-part structure observed 1 hour later shows a
core shaped similarly to the eruptive filament/prominence. The total measured
mass of the escaping CME (1.5x10to16 g from C2 LASCO observations) definitely
exceeds the estimated mass of the escaping cool prominence material although
assumptions made to analyse the Ha erupting prominence, as well as the
corresponding EUV darkening of the filament observed several days before, made
this evaluation uncertain by a factor of 2. From the current free extrapolation
we discuss the shape of the magnetic neutral surface and a possible scenario
leading to an instability, including the small scale dynamics inside and around
the filament.

the 2->1 S(1)/1->0 S(1) line ratios of 0.4 and 0.5. Of the 11 pre-main sequence
sources now known to be sources of quiescent near-infrared hydrogen emission,
four possess transitional disks, which suggests that detectable levels of H$_2$
emission and the presence of inner disk holes are correlated. These H$_2$
detections demonstrate that these inner holes are not completely devoid of gas,
in agreement with the presence of observable accretion signatures for all four
of these stars and the recent detections of [Ne II] emission from three of
them. The overlap in [Ne II] and H$_2$ detections hints at a possible
correlation between these two features and suggests a shared excitation
mechanism of high energy photons. Our models, combined with the kinematic
information from the H$_2$ lines, locate the bulk of the emitting gas at a few
tens of AU from the stars. We also find a correlation between H$_2$ detections
and those targets which possess the largest H$\alpha$ equivalent widths,
suggesting a link between accretion activity and quiescent H$_2$ emission. We
conclude that quiescent H$_2$ emission from relatively hot gas within the disks

UV photons and/or X-rays, and the evolutionary status of the dust grain

the longer wavelength emission and the ionization potential of Ne^3+, infrared
[Ne V] emission lines are thought to be excellent AGN diagnostics. However,
stellar evolution models predict Wolf-Rayet stars in young stellar clusters
emit significant numbers of photons capable of creating Ne^4+. Recent
observations of [Ne V] emission in optically classified starburst galaxies
require us to investigate whether [Ne V] can arise from star-formation activity
and not an AGN. In this work, we calculate the optical and IR spectrum of gas
exposed to a young starburst and AGN SED. We find: 1) a range of parameters
where [Ne V] emission can be explained solely by star-formation and 2) a range
of relative AGN to starburst luminosities that reproduce the [Ne V]
observations, yet leaves the optical spectrum looking like a starburst. We also
find infrared emission-line diagnostics are much more sensitive to the AGN than
optical diagnostics, particularly for weak AGN. We apply our model to the
optically classified, yet [Ne V] emitting, starburst galaxy NGC 3621. We find,
when taking the IR and optical spectrum into account, about 30 - 50% of the
galaxy's total luminosity is due to an AGN. Our calculations show that [Ne V]
emission is almost always the result of AGN activity. The models presented in

lines, which are insensitive to electron temperature, are used as the basis for
the determination of the composition, which are found to differ somewhat from
earlier results. The abundances found, especially the low value of helium and
oxygen, indicate that the central star was originally of rather low mass.
Abundances of phosphorus, iron, silicon and chlorine have been determined for
the first time in this nebula. The variation of electron temperature in this
nebula is very clear reaching quite high values close to the center. The
temperature of the central star is discussed in the light of the high observed
stages of ionization. The nebular information indicates the spectrum of the
star deviates considerably from a blackbody.

(or no) environmental dependencies within the same underlying population. We
compare these results with a sample of local AGN drawn from the SDSS. Contrary
to the high redshift behaviour, we find that both LINERs and Seyferts in the
SDSS show a slowly declining red sequence AGN fraction towards high density
environments. Interestingly, at z~1 red sequence Seyferts and LINERs are
approximately equally abundant. By z~0, however, the red Seyfert population has

forces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc and
the development of large-scale outflows. Pressure forces exerted by expanding
superbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphology
and creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. Hydrodynamic drag
within the disc results in a strong increase of the effective mass loading of
the wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case of
the high-mass galaxy.

incorrect. In the case where the number of sinusoidal signals is
under-estimated we show the almost sure convergence of the least squares

to obtain the quantum critical exponents and confirm the BEC nature of the

length, salt concentration, and local dielectric heterogeneity as physical
variables in the system. Self consistent calculations of effective charge and
size of polymer show that divalent counterions replace condensed monovalent
counterions in competitive adsorption. The theory further predicts that at
modest physical conditions, polymer charge is compensated and reversed with
increasing divalent salt. Consequently, the polyelectrolyte collapses and
reswells, respectively. Lower temperatures and higher degrees of dielectric
heterogeneity enhance condensation of all species of ions. Complete diagram of
states for the effective charge calculated as functions of Coulomb strength and

strenth, and (b) progressively higher presence of salt recharges the polymer

color-magnitude diagrams matching the fundamental parameters of NGC 1818, with
different binary fractions and mass-ratio distributions. We find that this

with F-star primaries and mass ratios $q > 0.4$, the binary fraction is $\sim
0.35$. This suggests a total binary fraction for F stars of 0.55 to unity,

pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the
superconducting gap above TC is one of the central questions in high-TC
research. While some experimental evidence suggests they are distinct, this
issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly
establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous
observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as

found a gap which opens at TC and exhibits a canonical (BCS-like) temperature

interactions together with Peierls-type electron-lattice couplings, we examine
the role of lattice degrees of freedom on charge order. It is found that the
experimentally observed, horizontal charge order is stabilized by lattice
distortion in both compounds. In particular, the lattice effect is crucial to
the realization of the charge order in \theta-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4, while the
peculiar band structure whose symmetry is lower than that of
\theta-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4 in the metallic phase is also an important factor in
\alpha-(ET)2I3 together with the lattice distortion. For \alpha-(ET)2I3, we
obtain a phase transition from a charge-disproportionated metallic phase to the
horizontal charge order with lattice modulations, which is consistent with the

temperature display an electronic noise, the Johnson-Nyquist noise, arising
from the thermal agitation of electric charges inside the conductor. The
existence of this noise implies that two nearby discharged conductors at finite
temperature should repel each other, as a result of the electrodynamic
interaction between the Johnson-Nyquist currents in either conductor and the
eddy currents they induce in the other. It is suggested that this force is at
the origin of the recently discovered large repulsive correction to the thermal
Casimir force between two lossy metallic plates. Further support for this
physical picture is obtained by studying a simple system of two linear noisy
antennas. Using elementary concepts from circuit theory, we show that the
repulsive force engendered by the Johnson-Nyquist noise results in the same
kind of thermodynamic inconsistencies found in the Casimir problem. We show
that all inconsistencies are however resolved if account is taken of capacitive
effects associated with the end points of the antennas. Our findings therefore
suggest that capacitive effects resulting from the finite size of the plates,
may be essential for a resolution of the analogous problems met in the thermal
Casimir effect.

that takes place at DNA melting. Unlike previous works, which considered
thermodynamic quantities averaged over many different inhomogeneous sequences,
we focused on precise sequences and investigated the succession of local
openings that lead to their dissociation. For this purpose, we performed
Transfer Integral type calculations with two different dynamical models, namely
the heterogeneous Dauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model and the model based on finite
stacking enthalpies we recently proposed. It appears that, for both models, the
essential effect of heterogeneity is to let different portions of the
investigated sequences open at slightly different temperatures. Besides this
macroscopic effect, the local aperture of each portion indeed turns out to be
very similar to that of a homogeneous sequence with the same length. Rounding
of each local opening transition is therefore merely a size effect. For the
Dauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model, sequences with a few thousands base pairs are
still far from the thermodynamic limit, so that it is inappropriate, for this
model, to discuss the order of the transition associated with each local
opening. In contrast, sequences with several hundreds to a few thousands base
pairs are pretty close to the thermodynamic limit for the model we proposed.
The temperature interval where power laws holds is consequently broad enough to
enable the estimation of critical exponents. On the basis of the few examples
we investigated, it seems that, for our model, disorder does not necessarily
induce a decrease of the order of the transition.

finite-state automaton. The synchronizing word of a deterministic automaton is
a word in the alphabet of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps
the automaton to a single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph of
uniform outdegree (constant outdegree of any vertex) is synchronizing if the
coloring turns the graph into a deterministic finite automaton possessing a
synchronizing word. The road coloring problem is the problem of synchronizing
coloring of a directed finite strongly connected graph of uniform outdegree if
the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles is one. The
problem posed in 1970 had evoked a noticeable interest among the specialists in
the theory of graphs, automata, codes, symbolic dynamics as well as among the
wide mathematical community. A polynomial time algorithm of $O(n^3)$ complexity
in the most worst case and quadratic in majority of studied cases for the road

KK monopole. The boundary of the SqKK black hole can not be matched perfectly
to that of the former reference spacetime because of the difference in
topology. However, the resultant classical action coincides with that
calculated by the counterterm subtraction scheme. The boundary of the KK
monopole has the same topology with that of the SqKK black hole and can be
matched to the boundary of the black hole perfectly. The resultant action takes
different value from the result given by using the former reference spacetime.
After a brief review of thermodynamic quantities of the black hole solutions,
we calculate thermodynamic potentials relevant for several thermodynamic
environments. The most stable state is different for each environment: For
example, the KK monopole is the most stable state in isothermal environment
with fixed gravitational tension. On the other hand, when the size of the
extra-dimension is fixed, the Minkowski times a circle is the most stable. It

results in statistical mechanics of disordered systems and its approach to
random combinatorial optimization problems. The second part is a discussion of
two original results.
  The first result concerns DPLL heuristics for random k-XORSAT, which is
equivalent to the diluted Ising p-spin model. It is well known that DPLL is
unable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.
that it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument
supports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known
UC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this
class must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,
which depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering
threshold.
  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to
variable ratios. In this regime, it is well known that the uniform distribution
of random instances is dominated by unsatisfiable instances. A general
technique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to
satisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to
characterize their solutions. It is found that in the limit of large clause to
variable ratios, the uniform distribution of satisfiable random k-SAT formulas
is asymptotically equal to the much studied Planted distribution.

forward shock models. We also show that the condition for ultra-high-energy
heavy nuclei such as iron to survive is almost the same as that for about TeV
gamma-rays to escape from the source and for high-energy neutrinos not to be
much produced. The multi-messenger astronomy by neutrino and GeV-TeV gamma-ray
telescopes such as IceCube and KM3Net, GLAST and MAGIC will be important to see
whether GRBs can be accelerators of ultra-high-energy heavy nuclei. We also
demonstrate expected spectra of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays, and
discuss their detectabilities. In addition, we discuss implictaions of the
GRB-UHECR hypothesis. We point out, since the number densities of HL-GRBs and
LL-GRBs are quite different, its detemination by UHECR observations is also
important.

B-spline basis sets to expand the single particle orbitals used to construct
the trial wavefunctions. Extensive tests on system size, time step, and other
sources of errors, performed on periodically repeated systems of up to 1050
atoms, show that all these errors together can be reduced to below 10 meV per

equilibrium volume of both the Mg and the MgH$_2$ crystals. The cohesive energy
of the Mg crystal is found to be 1.51(1) eV, and agrees perfectly with the

delay-differential equation depending on k fixed delays whose spectrum contains
those k purely imaginary numbers. The second result is a generalization of the
first result for delay-differential equations which admit a characteristic

result, the k eigenvalues can be distributed amongst the different factors.
Since the characteristic equation of scalar equations contain only exponential

applied to delay coupled D_n-symmetric cell systems with one-dimensional cells.

MEC there are also moderate enhancements of the quasi-elastic peak (6%-10%).
The calculation is performed both directly and via transformation of electric
multipoles to a form that involves the charge operator. The contribution of the
latter operator is suppressed in and below the quasielastic peak while at
higher energies the charge operator represents almost the whole MEC
contribution at the lowest q value. The effect of the Coulomb force in the
final state interaction is investigated for the threshold region at q=174

threshold. In comparison to experimental data one finds relatively good
agreement at q=250 and 400 MeV/c, while at q=500 MeV/c, presumably due to
relativistic effects, the theoretical quasi-elastic peak position is shifted to
somewhat higher energies. The strong MEC contributions in the threshold region

for an overview]. However, we can only measure the magnetic field vector
routinely with high accuracy in the photosphere with, e.g., Hinode/SOT, and
unfortunately these data do not fulfill the force-free consistency condition as
defined by Aly (1989). We must therefore apply some transformations to these
data before nonlinear force-free extrapolation codes can be legitimately
applied. To this end, we have developed a minimization procedure that uses the
measured photospheric field vectors as input to approximate a more
chromospheric like field The method was dubbed preprocessing. See Wiegelmann et
al. 2006 for details]. The procedure includes force-free consistency integrals
and spatial smoothing. The method has been intensively tested with model active
regions [see Metcalf et al. 2008] and been applied to several ground based
vector magnetogram data before. Here we apply the preprocessing program to
photospheric magnetic field measurements with the Hinode/SOT instrument.

core boundary (ICB) is supercooled and that a sizable mushy layer has developed
during the growth of the inner core. The morphological instability of the
liquid-solid interface which usually results in the formation of a mushy zone
has been intensively studied in metallurgy, but the freezing of the inner core
occurs in very unusual conditions: the growth rate is very small, and the
pressure gradient has a key role, the newly formed solid being hotter than the
adjacent liquid. We investigate the linear stability of a solidification front
under such conditions, pointing out the destabilizing role of the thermal and
solutal fields, and the stabilizing role of the pressure gradient. The main
consequence of the very small solidification rate is the importance of
advective transport of solute in liquid, which tends to remove light solute
from the vicinity of the ICB and to suppress supercooling, thus acting against
the destabilization of the solidification front. For plausible phase diagrams
of the core mixture, we nevertheless found that the ICB is likely to be
morphologically unstable, and that a mushy zone might have developed at the
ICB. The thermodynamic thickness of the resulting mushy zone can be
significant, from $\sim100$ km to the entire inner core radius, depending on
the phase diagram of the core mixture. However, such a thick mushy zone is
predicted to collapse under its own weight, on a much smaller length scale
($\lesssim 1$ km). We estimate that the interdendritic spacing is probably
smaller than a few tens of meter, and possibly only a few meters.

the physical cause for the time-evolution of the axis directions of inertial

perturbations. The time-evolution of axis directions of local inertial frames
(relative to given local fiducial axes) is given experimentally by the
precession angular velocity of gyroscopes, which in turn is given by the
operational definition of the gravitomagnetic field. The gravitomagnetic field
is caused by cosmological energy currents via the momentum constraint. This
equation for cosmological gravitomagnetism is analogous to Ampere's law, but it
holds also for time-dependent situtations. In the solution for an open universe
the 1/r^2-force of Ampere is replaced by a Yukawa force which is of identical
form for FRW backgrounds with $K = (-1, 0).$ The scale of the exponential

nonzero temperature. Functional renormalization provides us with a consistent
method to compute the effect of fluctuations beyond the Bogoliubov
approximation. For three dimensional dilute gases, we find an upper bound on
the scattering length a which is of the order of the microphysical scale -
typically the range of the Van der Waals interaction. In contrast to fermions
near the unitary bound, no strong interactions occur for bosons with
approximately pointlike interactions, thus explaining the high quantitative
reliability of perturbation theory for most quantities. For zero temperature we
compute the quantum phase diagram for bosonic quasiparticles with a general
dispersion relation, corresponding to an inverse microphysical propagator with
terms linear and quadratic in the frequency. We compute the temperature
dependence of the condensate and particle density n, and find for the critical
temperature T_c a deviation from the free theory, Delta T_c/T_c = 2.1 a
n^{1/3}. For the sound velocity at zero temperature we find very good agreement
with the Bogoliubov result, such that it may be used to determine the particle
density accurately.

of the global solar corona from observational data. Aims: We present an
optimization method for computing nonlinear magnetohydrostatic equilibria in
spherical geometry with the aim to obtain self-consistent solutions for the
coronal magnetic field, the coronal plasma density and plasma pressure using
observational data as input. Methods: Our code for the self-consistent
computation of the coronal magnetic fields and the coronal plasma solves the
non-force-free magnetohydrostatic equilibria using an optimization method.
Previous versions of the code have been used to compute non-linear force-free
coronal magnetic fields from photospheric measurements in Cartesian and
spherical geometry, and magnetostatic-equilibria in Cartesian geometry. We test
our code with the help of a known analytic 3D equilibrium solution of the
magnetohydrostatic equations. The detailed comparison between the numerical
calculations and the exact equilibrium solutions is made by using magnetic
field line plots, plots of density and pressure and some of the usual
quantitative numerical comparison measures. Results: We find that the method
reconstructs the equilibrium accurately, with residual forces of the order of
the discretisation error of the analytic solution. The correlation with the
reference solution is better than 99.9% and the magnetic energy is computed
accurately with an error of <0.1%. Conclusions: We applied the method so far to
an analytic test case. We are planning to use this method with real
observational data as input as soon as possible.

at a limiting magnitude of J~23. Assuming a total age for the system of 4.1
+/-1 Gyr, and utilising the latest evolutionary models for substellar objects,
this limit is equivalent to companion masses >7 +/-1 Mjup (T~300K). Taking into
account the likely orbital evolution of very low mass companions in the
post-main sequence phase, these J-band observations effectively survey orbits
around the white dwarf progenitor from 3 - 50AU. There is no flux excess
detected in any of the complimentary Spitzer IRAC mid-IR filters. We fit a DZ
white dwarf model atmosphere to the optical BVRI, 2MASS JHK and IRAC
photometry. The best solution gives T=6030 +/- 240K, log g=8.10 +/-0.04 and,
hence, M= 0.633 +/-0.022Msun. We then place a 3sigma upper limit of 10 +/-2

potentially interesting since this strongly polarized line forms in the solar
chromosphere where the magnetic field is rather poorly known. Aims. To
investigate the role of isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen in the
formation of the polarized \ion{Ba}{ii} ${\lambda}4554$ line and, thus, in the
determination of the magnetic field. Methods. Multipole relaxation and transfer
rates of the $d$ and p-states of \ion{Ba}{ii} by isotropic collisions with
neutral hydrogen are calculated. We consider a plane parallel layer of
\ion{Ba}{ii} situated at the low chromosphere and anisotropically illuminated
from below which produces linear polarization in the ${\lambda}4554$ line by
scattering processes. To compute that polarization, we solve the statistical
equilibrium equations for \ion{Ba}{ii} levels including collisions, radiation
and magnetic field effects. Results. Variation laws of the relaxation and
transfer rates with hydrogen number density $n_{\textrm {\scriptsize H}}$ and
temperature are deduced. The polarization of the ${\lambda}4554$ line is
clearly affected due to isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen although the
collisional depolarization of its upper level $^2P_{3/2}$ is negligible. This
is because the alignment of the metastable levels $^2D_{3/2}$ and $^2D_{5/2}$
of the \ion{Ba}{ii} are vulnerable to collisions. At the height of formation of
the ${\lambda}4554$ line where $n_{\textrm {\scriptsize H}} \sim 2 \times
10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$, we find that the neglecting of the collisions induces
inaccuracy of $\sim$ 25% on the calculation of the polarization and $\sim$ 35 %
inaccuracy on microturbulent magnetic field determination.

present in such systems models many-body interactions in superfluid systems and
allows one to study the effects of negative pressure on vortex dynamics. We
find the critical pressure for which the straight-line vortex becomes unstable
to radial expansion of the core. The energy of the straight-line vortices and
energy, impulse and velocity of vortex rings are calculated. The effect of a
varying pressure on the vortex core is studied. It is shown that under the
action of the periodically varying pressure field a vortex ring may split into
many vortex rings and the conditions for which this happens are elucidated.
These processes are also relevant to experiments in Bose-Einstein condensates
where the strength and the sign of two-body interactions can be changed via
Feshbach resonance.
