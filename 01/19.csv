850- and 1200-micron submillimetre (submm) galaxy in the Lockman Hole. Our
observations were made at 890 micron with the Submillimetre Array (SMA). Our
high-resolution submm imaging detects LH850.02 at >6-sigma as a single compact
(size < 1 arcsec or < 8 kpc) point source and yields its absolute position to
~0.2-arcsec accuracy. LH850.02 has two alternative radio counterparts within
the SCUBA beam (LH850.02N & S), both of which are statistically very unlikely
to be so close to the SCUBA source position by chance. However, the precise
astrometry from the SMA shows that the submm emission arises entirely from
LH850.02N, and is not associated with LH850.02S (by far the brighter of the two
alternative identifications at 24-micron). Fits to the optical-infrared
multi-colour photometry of LH850.02N & S indicate that both lie at z~3.3, and
are therefore likely to be physically associated. At these redshifts, the 24
micron--to--submm flux density ratios suggest that LH850.02N has an Arp220-type
starburst-dominated far-IR SED, while LH850.02S is more similar to Mrk231, with
less dust-enshrouded star-formation activity, but a significant contribution at
24-micron (rest-frame ~5-6 micron) from an active nucleus. This complex mix of
star-formation and AGN activity in multi-component sources may be common in the
high redshift ultraluminous galaxy population, and highlights the need for
precise astrometry from high resolution interferometric imaging for a more
complete understanding.

cosmology and galaxy formation, which may expose weaknesses in our

predominately gas rich, star forming and blue, a sub-population of bright red
void galaxies can also be found, whose star formation was shut down long ago.
Are the same processes that quench star formation in denser regions of the
Universe also at work in voids?
  We compare the luminosity function of void galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy
Redshift Survey, to those from a galaxy formation model built on the Millennium
Simulation. We show that a global star formation suppression mechanism in the
form of low luminosity ""radio mode"" AGN heating is sufficient to reproduce the
observed population of void early-types. Radio mode heating is environment
independent other than its dependence on dark matter halo mass, where, above a
critical mass threshold of approximately M_vir~10^12.5 M_sun, gas cooling onto
the galaxy is suppressed and star formation subsequently fades. In the
Millennium Simulation, the void halo mass function is shifted with respect to
denser environments, but still maintains a high mass tail above this critical
threshold. In such void halos, radio mode heating remains efficient and red
galaxies are found; collectively these galaxies match the observed space
density without any modification to the model. Consequently, galaxies living in
vastly different large-scale environments but hosted by halos of similar mass
are predicted to have similar properties, consistent with observations.

the bulk, but topologically robust gapless states at the edge. Recently, this
novel effect has been predicted and observed in HgTe quantum wells. In this

band structure exhibits an ""inverted"" phase similar to CdTe/HgTe quantum wells,
which is a QSH state when the Fermi level lies inside the gap. Due to the
asymmetric structure of this quantum well, the effects of inversion symmetry
breaking and inter-layer charge transfer are essential. By standard
self-consistent calculations, we show that the QSH state persists when these
corrections are included, and a quantum phase transition between the normal
insulator and the QSH phase can be electrically tuned by the gate voltage.

that the local flow in the vicinity of a particle is treated as if it were a
steady hyperbolic flow, whereas in reality it must fluctuate. We derive exact
expressions for the steady-state collision rate for particles suspended in
rapidly fluctuating random flows and compute how this steady state is

Advertisers specify a budget constraint, as well as a maximum cost per click,

  We give a truthful mechanism under the utility model where bidders try to
maximize their clicks, subject to their personal constraints. In addition, we
show that the revenue-maximizing mechanism is not truthful, but has a Nash
equilibrium whose outcome is identical to our mechanism. As far as we can tell,
this is the first treatment of sponsored search that directly incorporates both
multiple slots and budget constraints into an analysis of incentives.
  Our mechanism employs a descending-price auction that maintains a solution to
a certain machine scheduling problem whose job lengths depend on the price, and
hence is variable over the auction. The price stops when the set of bidders
that can afford that price pack exactly into a block of ad slots, at which
point the mechanism allocates that block and continues on the remaining slots.
To prove our result on the equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing mechanism, we
first show that a greedy algorithm suffices to solve the revenue-maximizing
linear program; we then use this insight to prove that bidders allocated in the

surface brightness and disk opacity. In the Spitzer era, SED models of spiral
disks add a new perspective on the role of dust in spiral disks. Combined with
the overall opacity from galaxy counts, they yield a typical optical depth of
the dusty ISM clouds: 0.4 that implies a size of $\sim$ 60 pc. Work on galaxy
counts is currently ongoing on the ACS fields of M51, M101 and M81. Occulting
galaxies offer the possibility of probing the history of disk opacity from
higher redshift pairs. Evolution in disk opacity could influence distance
measurements (SN1a, Tully-Fisher relation). Here, we present first results from
spectroscopically selected occulting pairs in the SDSS. The redshift range for
this sample is limited, but does offer a first insight into disk opacity
evolution as well as a reference for higher redshift measurements. Spiral disk
opacity has not undergone significant evolution since z=0.2. HST imaging would
help disentangle the effects of spiral arms in these pairs. Many more
mixed-morphology types are being identified in SDSS by the GalaxyZoo project.
The occulting galaxy technique can be pushed to a redshift of 1 using many

and differ from their Galactic counterparts due to their immense luminosities,
large linewidths and 1667/1665 MHz flux ratios, which are always greater than
one. We find that these maser properties result from strong 53 micron radiative
pumping combined with line overlap effects caused by turbulent linewidths of
about 20 km/s; pumping calculations that do not include line overlap are
unreliable. A minimum dust temperature of about 45 K is needed for inversion,
and maximum maser efficiency occurs for dust temperatures in the range 80 - 140
K. We find that warmer dust can support inversion at lower IR luminosities, in
agreement with observations. Our results are in good agreement with a clumpy
model of OHMs, with clouds sizes about 1 pc and OH column densities about 5e16
cm^2, that is able to explain both the diffuse and compact emission observed
for OHMs. We suggest that all OH main line masers may be pumped by far-IR
radiation, with the major differences between OHMs and Galactic OH masers
caused by differences in linewidth produced by line overlap. Small Galactic
maser linewidths tend to produce stronger 1665 MHz emission. The large OHM
linewidths lead to inverted ground state transitions having approximately the
same excitation temperature, producing 1667/1665 MHz flux ratios greater than
one and weak satellite line emission. Finally, the small observed ratio of
pumping radiation to dense molecular gas, as traced by HCN and HCO$^+$, is a
possible reason for the lack of OH megamaser emission in NGC 6240.

microquasar scenario or wind interaction in a young nonaccreting pulsar
scenario.
  Aims. To present new high-resolution radio images and compare them with the
expected behavior in the different scenarios.
  Methods. We analyze Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio observations that
provide morphological and astrometric information at milliarcsecond scales.
  Results. We detect a changing morphology between two images obtained five
days apart. In both runs there is a core component with a constant flux
density, and an elongated emission with a position angle (PA) that changes by
12+/-3 degrees between both runs. The source is nearly symmetric in the first
run and asymmetric in the second one. The astrometric results are not
conclusive.
  Conclusions. A simple and shockless microquasar scenario cannot easily
explain the observed changes in morphology. An interpretation within the young
nonaccreting pulsar scenario requires the inclination of the binary system to
be very close to the upper limit imposed by the absence of X-ray eclipses.

concerning an apparent violation of unitarity of the mechanism, which requires
Dolgov-Zakharov poles, are carefully examined, using a class of amplitudes
studied in the past by Bouchiat-Iliopoulos-Meyer (BIM), and elaborating on
previous studies. In the Wess-Zumino case we determine explicitly the unitarity

significantly on the St\""uckelberg mass and on the coupling of the extra

potential evaporation of the bare soil. It is also possible to determine the
distribution of rainfall or other variables such as hydraulic conductivity.
Studies have shown that microwave sensors could be used to scan the surface
soil moisture. The solution choose by the team associated with the SMOS mission
(Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) is to use a radiometer (1.4 GHz) to identify
soil microwave emissions . The measurements are made on the site of CESBIO in
Toulouse where a 1.4 GHz radiometer is installed . The effect of vegetation
cover, soil temperatures, snow cover, topography or moisture variations have an
important role in the broadcast microwave surface. Other parameters such as the
presence of inclusions in the ground (holes, stones), or soil texture can also
disrupt measurements. The aim of the work that we present in this paper is to
develop a numerical model to simulate complex geological structures. This model
must take into account all parameters that can affect the equivalent
permittivity measured by the radiometer (surface, moisture variation ,...
inclusions). The purpose of this model is to calculate the equivalent
permittivity of these geological structures in order to be able to associate
with each radiometer measurement an equivalent moisture.

enhancing the efficiency of the quantum search. Recently Li and Li found that a
particular form of phase matching yields, with a single Grover operation, a

the oscillations of the success probability that occur with multiple Grover

to a certain matching rule by which we can obtain a multiple Grover operation
that with only a few iterations yields a success probability that is almost
constant and unity over a wide range of the fraction of marked items. As an

and J. V. Narlikar forty years ago. It is shown that the creation processes
which takes place in the nuclei of galaxies are closely linked to the high
energy and explosive phenomena, which are commonly observed in galaxies at all
redshifts.
  The cyclic nature of the universe provides a natural link between the places
of origin of the microwave background radiation (arising in hydrogen burning in
stars), and the origin of the lightest nuclei (H, D, He$^3$ and He$^4$). It
also allows us to relate the large scale cyclic properties of the universe to
events taking place in the nuclei of galaxies. Observational evidence shows
that ejection of matter and energy from these centers in the form of compact
objects, gas and relativistic particles is responsible for the population of
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and gamma-ray burst sources in the universe.
  In the later parts of the paper we briefly discuss the major unsolved
problems of this integrated cosmological and cosmogonical scheme. These are the
understanding of the origin of the intrinsic redshifts, and the periodicities
in the redshift distribution of the QSOs.

manner noticeably different from the prediction of the standard model, which
assumes that there are no stresses in that region. We provide estimates of how
phenomenologically interesting parameters like the ``radiation edge"", the
innermost ring of the disc from which substantial thermal radiation escapes to
infinity, may be altered by stresses near the ISCO. These estimates are based
on data from a large number of three-dimensional GRMHD simulations combined
with GR ray-tracing. For slowly spinning black holes ($a/M<0.9$), the radiation
edge lies well inside where the standard model predicts, particularly when the
system is viewed at high inclination. For more rapidly spinning black holes,
the contrast is smaller. At fixed total luminosity, the characteristic
temperature of the accretion flow increases between a factor of $1.2-2.4$ over
that predicted by the standard model, whilst at fixed mass accretion rate,
there is a corresponding enhancement of the accretion luminosity which may be
anywhere from tens of percent to order unity. When all these considerations are
combined, we find that, for fixed black hole mass, luminosity, and inclination
angle, our uncertainty in the characteristic temperature of the radiation
reaching distant observers due to uncertainty in dissipation profile (around a
factor of 3) is {\it greater} than the uncertainty due to a complete lack of
knowledge of the black hole's spin (around a factor of 2) and furthermore that
spin estimates based on the stress-free inner boundary condition provide an
upper limit to $a/M$.

select cleaner subsamples with more secure photo-z estimates. We consider
Hyperz, BPZ, and the code used in the CADIS, COMBO-17, and HIROCS surveys.
Results. The photo-z error estimates of the three codes do not correlate
tightly with the accuracy of the photo-z's. While very large errors sometimes
indicate a true catastrophic photo-z failure, smaller errors are usually not
meaningful. For any given dataset, we find significant differences in redshift
accuracy and outlier rates between the different codes when compared to
spectroscopic redshifts. However, different codes excel in different regimes.
The agreement between different sets of photo-z's is better for the subsample
with secure spectroscopic redshifts than for the whole catalogue. Conclusions.
Running today's photo-z codes on well-calibrated ground-based data can lead to
reasonable accuracy. The actual performance on a given dataset is largely
dependent on the template choice and on realistic instrumental response curves.
It would be desirable to improve the photo-z error estimation for future
applications so as to get a better handle on rejecting objects with grossly
inaccurate photo-z's. The secure spectroscopic subsamples commonly used for
assessments of photo-z accuracy may be biased toward objects for which the
photo-z's are easier to estimate than for a complete flux-limited sample,
resulting in very optimistic estimates. (abridged)

observed with Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL/IBIS, shows the power law shape typical of
radio loud (broad emission line) active galactic nuclei (with a photon index
around 1.6) and a hint of spectral curvature below 2 keV, possibly due to
intrinsic absorption (N_H about 7e22 cm-2) local to the source. Alternatively,
a slope change (of about 1 in terms of photon index) around 2.7 keV can
describe the X-ray spectrum equally well. At this redshift, the observed 20-100
keV luminosity of the source is about 1e48 erg s-1 (assuming isotropic
emission), making Swift J1656.3-3302 one of the most X-ray luminous blazars.
This source is yet another example of a distant gamma-ray loud quasar
discovered above 20 keV. It is also the farthest object, among the previously
unidentified INTEGRAL sources, whose nature has been determined a posteriori
through optical spectroscopy.

post-Asymptotic Giant Branch or post-Red Supergiant) exhibiting a double peaked
spectral energy distribution (SED) with a sharp rise from $\sim8-20$ $\mu$m.
Such features have been associated with ejected dust shells or inwardly
truncated circumstellar discs. In order to compare SEDs from both systems, we
employ a spherically symmetric radiative transfer code and compare it to a
radiative, inwardly truncated disc code. As a case study, we model the
broad-band SED of HD 179821 using both codes. Shortward of 40 $\mu$m, we find
that both models produce equivalent fits to the data. However, longward of 40
$\mu$m, the radial density distribution and corresponding broad range of disc
temperatures produce excess emission above our spherically symmetric solutions
and the observations. For HD 179821, our best fit consists of a $T_{eff}=7000$
K central source characterized by $\tau_V\sim1.95$ and surrounded by a
radiatively driven, spherically symmetric dust shell. The extinction of the
central source reddens the broad-band colours so that they resemble a
$T_{eff}=5750$ K photosphere. We believe that HD 179821 contains a hotter
central star than previously thought. Our results provide an initial step
towards a technique to distinguish geometric differences from spectral
modeling.

entire electronic wavefunction is propagated on a grid with appropriately short

probabilities and thermal reaction rates. Quantum computers using these

a matching pair of indexes. It was shown recently by Valiant, Cai, and
Choudhary that tensor networks can be efficiently contracted on planar graphs
if components of every tensor obey a system of quadratic equations known as
matchgate identities. Such tensors are referred to as matchgate tensors. The
present paper provides an alternative approach to contraction of matchgate
tensor networks that easily extends to non-planar graphs. Specifically, it is
shown that a matchgate tensor network on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ with $n$
vertices can be contracted in time $T=poly(n) + 2^{2g} O(m^3)$ where $m$ is the
minimum number of edges one has to remove from $G$ in order to make it planar.

is dominated by a Regge pole whose nature varies as a function of the 't Hooft

whereas at weak g, the pole is that of the hard perturbative BFKL pomeron. We
concentrate on the weak coupling regime and analyze pomeron exchange directly
in position space. The analysis relies heavily on the conformal symmetry of the
transverse space E^2 and of its holographic dual hyperbolic space H_3,
describing with an unified language, both the weak and strong 't Hooft coupling
regimes. In particular, the form of the impact factors is highly constrained in
position space by conformal invariance. Finally, the analysis suggests a
possible AdS eikonal resummation of multi-pomeron exchanges implementing AdS
unitarity, which differs from the usual 4-dimensional eikonal exponentiation.
Relations to violations of 4-dimensional unitarity at high energy and to the

recently become a popular tool to identify DNA copy number variations along the
genome. These profiles are starting to be used as markers to improve prognosis
or diagnosis of cancer, which implies that methods for automated supervised
classification of arrayCGH data are needed. Like gene expression profiles,
arrayCGH profiles are characterized by a large number of variables usually
measured on a limited number of samples. However, arrayCGH profiles have a
particular structure of correlations between variables, due to the spatial
organization of BACs along the genome. This suggests that classical
classification methods, often based on the selection of a small number of
discriminative features, may not be the most accurate methods and may not
produce easily interpretable prediction rules.
  Results: We propose a new method for supervised classification of arrayCGH
data. The method is a variant of support vector machine (SVM) that incorporates
the biological specificities of DNA copy number variations along the genome as
prior knowledge. The resulting classifier is a sparse linear classifier based
on a limited number of regions automatically selected on the chromosomes,
leading to easy interpretation and identification of discriminative regions of
the genome. We test this method on three classification problems for bladder
and uveal cancer, involving both diagnosis and prognosis. We demonstrate that
the introduction of the new prior on the classifier leads not only to more
accurate predictions, but also to the identification of known and new regions
of interest in the genome.

significantly extended existing ideas on decomposing the flow into thin
fillets; he did not however have a correct picture of the global structure of
the flow around a body. Borda in 1766 showed that the principle of live forces
implied the vanishing of the drag and should thus be inapplicable to the
problem. After having at first refused the possibility of a vanishing drag,
d'Alembert in 1768 established the paradox, but only for bodies with a
head-tail symmetry. A full understanding of the paradox, as due to the neglect
of viscous forces, had to wait until the work of Saint-Venant in 1846.

expectation values. Then one can discuss cold dark matter candidates, because
of no needing so heavy particles and having a $Z_2$ parity symmetry
corresponding to the R-parity symmetry of the MSSM.
  The most famous work would be the Zee model.
  Recently a new type model along this line of thought was proposed by Mr. E.
Ma. We paid attention to this idea. We introduce a flavor symmetry based on a
dihedral group $D_6$ to constrain the Yukawa sector. For the neutrino sector,
we find that the maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos is realized, it can
also be shown that only an inverted mass spectrum, the value of
$|V_{MNS_{13}}|$ is 0.0034 and so on. When one extends the Higgs sector, it
leads to FCNCs mediated by Higgs fields generally. But in our model, the FCNCs
are (of course) suppressed for the experiments sufficiently. For the fermionic
CDM candidates, we find that the mass of the CDM and the inert Higgs should be
larger than about 230 and 300 GeV, respectively. If we restrict ourselves to a
perturbative regime, they should be lighter than about 750 GeV.

analysed. The paper addresses the two distinct issues of the changes in modal
properties and the influence of crack breathing on dynamic response during
operation. Moreover, the evolution of the orbit of a cracked rotor near half of
the first resonance frequency is investigated. The results provide a possible
basis for an on-line monitoring system. In order to conduct this study, the
dynamic response of a rotor with a breathing crack is evaluated by using the
alternate frequency/time domain approach. It is shown that this method
evaluates the nonlinear behaviour of the rotor system rapidly and efficiently
by modelling the breathing crack with a truncated Fourier series. The dynamic
response obtained by applying this method is compared with that evaluated
through numerical integration. The resulting orbit during transient operation
is presented and some distinguishing features of a cracked rotor are examined.

will provide new challenges for designers of astronomical instrumentation. The
varied science cases for these extremely large telescopes (ELTs) require a
large range of angular resolutions, from near diffraction-limited performance
via correction of atmospheric turbulence using adaptive optics (AO), to
seeing-limited observations. Moreover, the scientific output of the telescopes
must also be optimized with the consideration that, with current technology, AO
is relatively ineffective at visible wavelengths, and that atmospheric
conditions will often preclude high-performance AO. This paper explores some of
the issues that arise when designing ELT instrumentation that operates across a
range of angular resolutions and wavelengths. We show that instruments designed
for seeing-limited or seeing-enhanced observations have particular challenges
in terms of size and mass, while diffraction-limited instruments are not as
straightforward as might be imagined.

concepts for the European ELT, but there are also significant possibilities for
their inclusion in new VLT instruments, ensuring the continued success and
productivity of these unique telescopes.
