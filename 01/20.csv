of serendipitous stellar occultations are reported. Photometric time series
were obtained on the 1.8m telescope at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory
(DAO) in Victoria, BC, and were analyzed for the presence of occultation
events. Observations were performed at 40 Hz and included a total of 5.0
star-hours for target stars in the ecliptic open cluster M35 (beta=0.9deg), and
2.1 star-hours for control stars in the off-ecliptic open cluster M34
(beta=25.7deg). To evaluate the recovery fraction of the analysis method, and
thereby determine the limiting detectable size, artificial occultation events
were added to simulated time series (1/f scintillation-like power-spectra), and
to the real data. No viable candidate occultation events were detected. This
limits the cumulative surface density of KBOs to 3.5e10 deg^{-2} (95%
confidence) for KBOs brighter than m_R=35.3 (larger than ~860m in diameter,
assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04 and a distance of 40 AU). An evaluation of
TNO occultations reported in the literature suggests that they are unlikely to
be genuine, and an overall 95%-confidence upper limit on the surface density of
2.8e9 deg^{-2} is obtained for KBOs brighter than m_R=35 (larger than ~1 km in
diameter, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04 and a distance of 40 AU) when all
existing surveys are combined.

its true average, which is quantifiable through the Markovian self-transition

the hindering of the quantum state transitions that rapid state measurements
introduce, known as the Quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Based on the current

allowed for the estimation of the two self-transition probabilities in this

we propose the use of the parameter of baryonic asymmetry of the universe due

implemented so as to conserve the total activation entering the system. In our
equilibrium investigations, the internally stored activation is limited to the
value of the respective threshold. The synchronization of the activation of the
network is then quantified in terms of its normalized entropy. The equilibrium
investigations involve the application of a number of complementary

spiking oscillations and the hierarchical structure of the networks and the

attractive Gaudin-Yang model. Our studies are based on an accurate microscopic
spin-density-functional theory through the Kohn-Sham scheme which employs the
one-dimensional homogeneous Gaudin-Yang model with Luther-Emery-liquid
ground-state correlation as a reference system. A Thomas-Fermi approximation is
examined incorporating the exchange-correlation interaction. By studying the
charge and spin density profiles of the system based on these methods, we gain
a quantitative understanding of the role of attractive interactions and
polarization on the formation of the two-shell structure, with the coexisted
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type phase in the center of the trap and
either the BCS superfluid phase or the normal phase at the edges of the trap.
Our results are in good agreement with the recent theoretical consequences.

standpoint. The bulk geometry is flat. Z$_2$ symmetry and the periodic
property, for the extra coordinate, are taken into account. After confirming
the consistency with the past result, we do new things based on a {\it new
regularization}. In the treatment of the divergences, we introduce IR and UV
cut-offs and {\it restrict} the (4D momentum, extra coordinate)-integral
region. The regularized configuration is the {\it sphere lattice}, in the 4D
continuum space, which changes along the extra coordinate. The change
(renormalization flow) is specified by the {\it minimal area principle}, hence
this regularization configuration is string-like. We do the analysis not in the
Kaluza-Klein expanded form but in a {\it closed} form. We do {\it not} use any
perturbation. The formalism is based on the heat-kernel approach using the {\it
position/momentum propagator}. Interesting relations between the heat-kernels
and the P/M propagators are obtained, where we introduce the {\it generalized}
P/M propagators. A useful expression of the Casimir energy, in terms of the P/M
propagator, is obtained. The restricted-region approach is replaced by the
weight-function approach in the latter-half description. Its meaning, in
relation to the {\it space-time quantization}, is argued. {\it Finite} Casimir
energy is numerically obtained. The compactification-size parameter
(periodicity) suffers from the renormalization effect. Numerical evaluation is
exploited. Especially the minimal surface lines in the 5D flat space are
obtained both numerically using the Runge-Kutta method and analytically using
the general solution.

$LG^\omega$, just as $\FOLDNb$, features extensions of first-order
intuitionistic logic with fixed points and a ``generic quantifier'', $\nabla$,
which is used to reason about the dynamics of bindings in object systems
encoded in the logic. A previous attempt to extend $\FOLDNb$ with an induction

inductive specifications. It turns out that this problem can be solved by
relaxing some restrictions on $\nabla$, in particular by adding the axiom $B

error exponent for the Neyman-Pearson detector satisfying a fixed level
constraint is obtained using the large deviations principle. For a symmetric
first order autoregressive model, the error exponent is given explicitly in
terms of the SNR and an edge dependence factor (field correlation). The
behavior of the error exponent as a function of correlation strength is seen to
divide into two regions depending on the value of the SNR. At high SNR,
uncorrelated observations maximize the error exponent for a given SNR, whereas
there is non-zero optimal correlation at low SNR. Based on the error exponent,
the energy efficiency (defined as the ratio of the total information gathered
to the total energy required) of ad hoc sensor network for detection is
examined for two sensor deployment models: an infinite area model and and
infinite density model. For a fixed sensor density, the energy efficiency
diminishes to zero at rate O(area^{-1/2}) as the area is increased. On the
other hand, non-zero efficiency is possible for increasing density depending on
the behavior of the physical correlation as a function of the link length.

similar structure to the ordinary laws of thermodynamics as an extension of the
work for the six-dimensional model [20]. In this relation, the area of dS
horizon (integrated over the two internal dimensions) exactly behaves as the
thermodynamical entropy. The dynamically unstable solutions are in the
thermodynamically unstable branch. An unstable dS compactification either
evolves toward a stable configuration or two-dimensional internal space is
decompactified. These dS brane solutions are equivalent to the accelerating
cosmological solutions in the six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory
via dimensional reduction. Thus, if the seed higher-dimensional solution is
unstable, the corresponding six-dimensional solution is also unstable. From the
effective four-dimensional point of view, a cosmological evolution from an
unstable cosmological solution in higher dimensions may be seen as a process of
the transition from the initial cosmological inflation to the current dark

while the gas velocity dispersions have been measured by Gaussian fits to the
H$\beta$ and [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$ 5007 \AA lines on the high dispersion
spectra. Values of the stellar velocity dispersions are between 30 and 68 km/s.
We apply the virial theorem to estimate dynamical masses of the clusters,
assuming that systems are gravitationally bounded and spherically symmetric,
and using previously measured sizes. The measured values of the stellar
velocity dispersions yield dynamical masses of the order of 10$^7$ to 10$^8$
solar masses for the whole CNSFRs. Stellar and gas velocity dispersions are
found to differ by about 20 to 30 km/s with the H$\beta$ emission lines being
narrower than both the stellar lines and the [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$ 5007 \AA
lines. The twice ionized oxygen, on the other hand, shows velocity dispersions
comparable to those shown by stars, in some cases, even larger. We have found
indications of the presence of two different kinematical components in the
ionized gas of the regions...

giant branch (AGB), as well as similar stars experiencing high mass loss rates.
In addition to the escaping wind, in this zone there are parcels of gas that do
not reach the escape velocity. These parcels of dense gas rise slowly and then
fall back. The wind and bound gas exist simultaneously to distances of ~100AU.
I term this region the effervescent zone. In this phenomenological study I find
that the density of the bound material in the effervescent zone falls as
~r^{-5/2}, not much faster than the wind density. The main motivation to
propose the effervescent model is to allow wide binary companions to influence
the morphology of the descendant planetary nebulae (PN) by accreting mass from
the effervescent zone. Accretion from the effervescent zone is more efficient
than accretion from the wind in forming an accretion disk around the companion.
The companion might then blow two jets that will shape the descendant PN.

strong variation of the gravitational coupling constant in very early universe.
The model predicts that the non--compensated remnant of vacuum energy changes
very slowly at late stages of the cosmological evolution and is naturally close
to the observed one. Asymptotically the effective vacuum energy tends to a
negative value, so the cosmological expansion should stop and turn into
contraction. There remains the problem of introduction of the usual matter into
the model and therefore realising realistic cosmology.

the collapse and the fragmentation of prestellar cores with increasingly
accurate numerical simulations. Thanks to the advances in sub-millimeter
observations, a wide range of observed initial conditions enable us to study
the different modes of low-mass star formation. The challenge for the
simulations is to reproduce the observational results. Two main numerical
methods, namely AMR and SPH, are widely used to simulate the collapse and the
fragmentation of prestellar cores. We compare thoroughly these two methods
within their standard framework. We use the AMR code RAMSES and the SPH code
DRAGON. Our physical model is as simple as possible and consists of an
isothermal sphere rotating around the z-axis. We first study the conservation
of angular momentum as a function of the resolution. Then, we explore a wide
range of simulation parameters to study the fragmentation of prestellar cores.
There seems to be a convergence between the two methods, provided resolution in
each case is sufficient. Resolution criteria adapted to our physical cases, in
terms of resolution per Jeans mass, for an accurate description of the
formation of protostellar cores are deduced from the present study. This
convergence is encouraging for future work in simulations of low-mass star
formation, providing the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.
