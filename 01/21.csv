with branch and bound, the computational complexity of branch and bound yields
instances of not more than about 90 spins. We describe several approaches based
on the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) to reliably
identifying ground states of SK instances intractable with branch and bound,
and present a broad range of empirical results on such problem instances. We
argue that the proposed methodology holds a big promise for reliably solving
large SK spin-glass instances to optimality with practical time complexity. The
proposed approaches to identifying global optima reliably can also be applied
to other problems and they can be used with many other evolutionary algorithms.
Performance of hBOA is compared to that of the genetic algorithm with two

old UHECR problem consisted in absence of the sharp steepening in spectrum of

most serious cosmological problem is caused by large vacuum energy of the known

this paper is to provide an effective computation of the universal toric genus
for the complex, almost complex and stable complex structures which are
invariant under the canonical left action of the maximal torus T^k on G/H. As
it is known, on G/H we may have many such structures and the computations of
their toric genus in terms of fixed points for the same torus action give the
constraints on possible collections of weights for the corresponding
representations of T^k in the tangent spaces at the fixed points, as well as on
the signs at these points. In that context, the effectiveness is also
approached due to an explicit description of the relations between the weights
and signs for an arbitrary couple of such structures. Special attention is
devoted to the structures which are invariant under the canonical action of the
group G. Using classical results, we obtain an explicit description of the
weights and signs in this case. We consequently obtain an expression for the
cobordism classes of such structures in terms of coefficients of the formal
group law in cobordisms, as well as in terms of Chern numbers in cohomology.
These computations require no information on the cohomology ring of the
manifold G/H, but, on their own, give important relations in this ring. As an

bands in spectra of CH4 mixed with other ices are blueshifted relative to bands
in spectra of pure CH4-ice. A likely candidate for the other component is
N2-ice because its weak 2.15 micron band and blueshifted CH4 bands are seen in
spectra of Triton and Pluto. Assuming the shift is due to the presence of N2,
spectra taken on two consecutive nights show no difference in CH4/N2. In
addition, we find no measureable difference in CH4/N2 at different depths into

in $\chi^2$ fit for the 16 non-perturbative inputs which are essential in the
87 $B\to PP$ and $B\to VP$ decay channels. Chiraly enhanced penguins can change
several charming penguins sizably, since they share the same topology. However,
most of the other non-perturbative inputs and predictions on branching ratios

predict the branching fractions and CP asymmetries of other modes especially
$B_s\to VP$ decays. The agreements and differences with results in QCD
factorization and perturbative QCD approach are analyzed. We also study the

to the ratio of electric to magnetic form factors extracted using the

interaction such as the Ali-Bodmer potential, the suppression of the condensate
fraction at zero temperature with increasing density is considered. Using a
Jastrow-Feenberg approach, it is found that the condensate fraction vanishes
near saturation density. Additionally, the modification of the internal state
of the alpha particle due to medium effects will further reduce the condensate.
  In finite systems, an enhancement of the S state wave function of the c.o.m.
orbital of alpha particle motion is considered as the correspondence to the
condensate. Wave functions have been constructed for self-conjugate 4n nuclei

enhancement of the occupation of the S-state c.o.m. orbital of the

increases, similar to the density-induced suppression of the condensate

This is followed by a succinct account of existing underlying theories. I also
reflect on the implications of MOND's successes for the dark matter (DM)
paradigm: MOND predictions imply that baryons alone accurately determine the
full field of each and every individual galactic object. This conflicts with
the expectations in the DM paradigm because of the haphazard formation and
evolution of galactic objects and the very different influences that baryons
and DM are subject to during the evolution, as evidenced, e.g., by the very
small baryon-to-DM fraction in galaxies (compared with the cosmic value). All
this should disabuse DM advocates of the thought that DM will someday be able
to reproduce MOND: It is inconceivable that the modicum of baryons left over in

has a long history. Although there exist polynomial-time algorithms for the
two-dimensional planar case, where the problem of finding ground states is
transformed to a minimum-weight perfect matching problem, the reachable system
sizes have been limited both by the needed CPU time and by memory requirements.
In this work, we present an algorithm for the calculation of exact ground
states for two-dimensional Ising spin glasses with free boundary conditions in
at least one direction. The algorithmic foundations of the method date back to
the work of Kasteleyn from the 1960s for computing the complete partition

states for huge two-dimensional planar Ising spin-glass lattices (up to
3000x3000 spins) within reasonable time. According to our knowledge, these are
the largest sizes currently available. Kasteleyn cities were recently also used
by Thomas and Middleton in the context of extended ground states on the torus.
Moreover, they show that the method can also be used for computing ground
states of planar graphs. Furthermore, we point out that the correctness of
heuristically computed ground states can easily be verified. Finally, we
evaluate the solution quality of heuristic variants of the Bieche et al.
approach.

display morphological similarities to previous 8.4 GHz VLBA observations
carried out at the same orbital phase, suggesting a high level of periodicity
and stability of the processes behind the radio emission. This makes it
unlikely that variability of the radio emission is due to the interaction of an
outflow with variable wind clumps. If the radio emission is produced by a
milliarcsecond scale jet, it should also show a stable, periodic behavior. It
is then difficult to reconcile the absence of a large scale jet (~100 mas) in
our observations with the evidence of a persistent relativistic jet reported
previously. We find a possible hint of temporal correlation between the X-ray
and TeV emissions and evidence for radio/TeV non-correlation, which points to
the existence of one population of particles producing the radio emission and a
different one producing the X-ray and TeV emissions. Finally, we present a

we relate Poisson entropy with other definitions of entropy for infinite

coincides with Krengel's and Parry's entropy. In particular, this implies that
for null-recurrent Markov chains, the usual formula for the entropy $-\sum q_i

entropy dominates Parry's entropy in any conservative transformation. We also
prove that relative entropy (in the sense of Danilenko and Rudolph) coincides
with the relative Poisson entropy. Thus, for any factor of a conservative
transformation, difference of the Krengel's entropy is equal to the difference
of the Poisson entropies. In case there exists a factor with zero Poisson
entropy, we prove the existence of a maximum (Pinsker) factor with zero Poisson
entropy. Together with the preceding results, this answers affirmatively the

performance as the oracle estimator up to a logarithmic term. Oracle
inequalities allow to derive the maxiset of $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$. Then,
minimax properties of $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$ are established. We first prove
that the rate of this estimator on Besov spaces ${\cal B}^\al_{p,q}$ when
$p\leq 2$ is $(\ln(n)/n)^{\al/(1+2\al)}$. This result has two consequences.
First, it establishes that the minimax rate of Besov spaces ${\cal
B}^\al_{p,q}$ with $p\leq 2$ when non compactly supported functions are
considered is the same as for compactly supported functions up to a logarithmic
term. This result is new. Furthermore, $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$ is adaptive
minimax up to a logarithmic term. When $p>2$, the situation changes
dramatically and the rate of $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$ on Besov spaces ${\cal
B}^\al_{p,q}$ is worse than $(\ln(n)/n)^{\al/(1+2\al)}$. Finally, the random
threshold depends on a parameter $\gamma$ that has to be suitably chosen in
practice. Some theoretical results provide upper and lower bounds of $\gamma$
to obtain satisfying oracle inequalities. Simulations reinforce these results.

measured using RXTE data in a pre-outburst spike, with respect to the line

account for the difference in pulse profiles, and their energy evolution that

we identify each subhalo with a galaxy, and assign luminosity and morphological

between subhalo mass and galaxy luminosity of different types. One is using a
constant ratio in luminosity of early (E/SO) and late (S/Irr) type galaxies at
a fixed subhalo mass. And the other assumes that galaxies of different
morphological types but having an equal luminosity have a constant ratio in
their subhalo masses. We made a series of comparisons of the properties of
these simulated galaxies with those of the SDSS galaxies. The resulting
simulated galaxy sample is found to successfully reproduce the observed local
number density distribution except for in high density regions. The luminosity
function is studied as a function of local density. It was found that the
observed luminosity functions in different local density environments are
overall well-reproduced by the simulated galaxies. Discrepancy is found at the
bright end of the luminosity function of early types in the underdense regions
and at the faint end of both morphological types in very high density regions.
A significant fraction of the observed early type galaxies in voids seems to
have undergone a relatively recent star formation and became brighter. The lack
of faint simulated galaxies in dense regions may be due to the strong tidal
force of the central halo which destroys less massive satellite subhalos around
in the simulation. The mass-to-light ratio is found to depend on the local
density in the way similar to that observed in the SDSS sample. (abridged)

analytical results and a variety of numerical methods have been developed to
solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The time-dependent methods work
for nearly arbitrarily shaped potentials, including sources and sinks via
complex-valued potentials. Many quantities are measured at fixed energy, which
is seemingly not well suited for a time-dependent formulation. Very few methods
exist to obtain the energy-dependent Green function for complicated potentials

heating and cooling processes, which in turn are determined by atomic and
molecular physics and by chemical abundances. Features in the effective
equation of state of the gas, such as a transition from a cooling to a heating

of the SOHO spacecraft have revealed the occurrence of triple helmet streamers
even during solar minimum, which occasionally go unstable and give rise to
large coronal mass ejections. There are also indications that the slow solar
wind is either a combination of a quasi-stationary flow and a highly
fluctuating component or may even be caused completely by many small eruptions
or instabilities. As a first step we recently presented an analytical method to
calculate simple two-dimensional stationary models of triple helmet streamer
configurations. In the present contribution we use the equations of time-
dependent resistive magnetohydrodynamics to investigate the stability and the
dynamical behaviour of these configurations. We particularly focus on the
possible differences between the dynamics of single isolated streamers and
triple streamers and on the way in which magnetic reconnection initiates both
small scale and large scale dynamical behaviour of the streamers. Our results
indicate that small eruptions at the helmet streamer cusp may incessantly
accelerate small amounts of plasma without significant changes of the
equilibrium configuration and might thus contribute to the non-stationary slow
solar wind. On larger time and length scales, large coronal eruptions can occur
as a consequence of large scale magnetic reconnection events inside the
streamer configuration. Our results also show that triple streamers are usually
more stable than a single streamer.

evolutionary population synthesis models, aiming first to test the validity of
the soft X-ray luminosity as a star formation rate estimator, using the already
known calibration of the FIR luminosity as a proxy, and second proposing a
calibration based on the predictions of evolutionary synthesis models. We have
computed the soft X-ray and far infrared luminosities expected for a massive
starburst as a function of evolutionary state, efficiency of the conversion of
mechanical energy into soft X-ray luminosity, star formation regime
(instantaneous or extended) and dust abundance, and have compared the
predictions with observational values for a sample of 62 star-forming galaxies
taken from the literature. The observational Lsoftx/Lfir ratios are consistent
with the predictions by the models under realistic assumptions (young
starbursts, efficiency in the re-processing of mechanical energy of few
percent), confirming the direct relation of the diffuse soft X-ray emission
with the star formation episode. The soft X-ray emission of the diffuse,
extended gas surrounding massive star forming regions can be used as a Star
Formation Rate estimator. The empirical calibrations presented in the
literature are supported by the predictions of evolutionary synthesis models
and by the analysis of a larger sample of star-forming galaxies, but it is
biased towards galaxies dominated by relatively unevolved starbursts.

intergalatic absorption in the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), appear
unusually hard, a fact that poses challenges to the conventional models of
particle acceleration in TeV blazars and/or to the EBL models. In this paper we
show that the internal absorption of gamma-rays caused by interactions with
dense narrow-band radiation fields in the vicinity of compact gamma-ray
production regions can lead to the formation of gamma-ray spectra of an almost
arbitrary hardness. This allows significant relaxation of the current tight
constraints on particle acceleration and radiation models, although at the
expense of enhanced requirements to the available nonthermal energy budget. The
latter, however, is not a critical issue, as long as it can be largely
compensated by the Doppler boosting, assuming very large ($\geq 30$) Doppler
factors of the relativistically moving gamma-ray production regions. The
suggested scenario of formation of hard gamma-ray spectra predicts detectable
synchrotron radiation of secondary electron-positron pairs which might require
a revision of the current ``standard paradigm'' of spectral energy
distributions of gamma-ray blazars. If the primary gamma-rays are of hadronic
origin related to $pp$ or $p \gamma$ interactions, the ``internal gamma-ray
absorption'' model predicts neutrino fluxes close to the detection threshold of
the next generation high energy neutrino detectors.

to physics of conjugated polymers allows to suggest further experiments.
Internal tunnelling in Charge Density Waves goes through the channel of
""amplitude solitons"", which correspond to the long sought quasi-particle - the
spinon. The same experiment gives an access to the reversible reconstruction of
the junction via spontaneous creation of a lattice of 2Pi solitons - a grid of

STM experiments. Junctions of organic and oxide conductors are anticipated to
show similar effects of reconstruction.

that the dimension of the underlying Markovian process does not increase with

efficient iterative scheme from a numerical point of view. We finally suggest a

traps relevant molecules in astrophysical environments at temperatures higher
than expected from their characteristic sublimation point. To fulfil this aim
we have carried out desorption experiments under High Vacuum conditions based
on a Quartz Crystal Microbalance and additionally monitored with a Quadrupole

above the sublimation temperature in some astrophysical scenarios could be
explained by the presence of several retaining mechanisms related to the

that partnering strategies that exploit problem-specific knowledge are superior

summation, and the numerical feasibility and stability of the solution is
demonstrated. Relativistic invariance is achieved by constructing a dynamical
unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group on the three-nucleon Hilbert
space. Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction, observables for elastic and
break-up scattering are calculated for projectile energies in the intermediate
energy range up to 2 GeV, and compared to their nonrelativistic counterparts.
The convergence of the multiple scattering series is investigated as a function
of the projectile energy in different scattering observables and
configurations. Approximations to the two-body interaction embedded in the
three-particle space are compared to the exact treatment.

stripped material from disrupting substructure haloes or subhaloes in a sample
of high resolution cosmological N-body host haloes ranging from galaxy- to
cluster-mass scales. We focus on devising methods to recover the infall mass
and infall eccentricity of subhaloes from the properties of their tidally
stripped material (i.e. tidal streams). Our analysis reveals that there is a
relation between the scatter of stream particles about the best-fit debris
plane and the infall mass of the progenitor subhalo. This allows us to
reconstruct the infall mass from the spread of its tidal debris in space. We
also find that the spread in radial velocities of the debris material (as
measured by an observer located at the centre of the host) correlates with the
infall eccentricity of the subhalo, which allows us to reconstruct its orbital
parameters. We devise an automated method to identify leading and trailing arms
that can, in principle at least, be applied to observations of stellar streams
from satellite galaxies. This method is based on the energy distribution of
material in the tidal stream. Using this method, we show that the mass
associated with leading and trailing arms differ. While our analysis indicates
that tidal streams can be used to recover certain properties of their
progenitor subhaloes (and consequently satellites), we do not find strong
correlations between host halo properties and stream properties. This likely
reflects the complicated relationship between the stream and the host, which in
a cosmological context is characterised by a complex mass accretion history, an
asymmetric mass distribution and the abundance of substructure. [...]
