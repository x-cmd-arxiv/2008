functions of graphene, in the hydrodynamic regime induced by electron-electron
collisions. In moderate magnetic fields, the Dirac particles undergo a
collective cyclotron motion with a temperature-dependent relativistic cyclotron
frequency proportional to the net charge density of the Dirac plasma. In
contrast to the undamped cyclotron pole in Galilean-invariant systems (Kohn's
theorem), here there is a finite damping induced by collisions between the
counter-propagating particles and holes. This cyclotron motion shows up as a
damped pole in the frequency dependent conductivities, and should be readily
detectable in microwave measurements at room temperature. We also discuss the
large Nernst effect to be expected in graphene.

understanding of many solar activity phenomena, e.g. flares and CMEs. However,
the direct measurement of coronal magnetic fields is not possible with present
methods, and therefore the coronal field has to be extrapolated from
photospheric measurements. Due to the low plasma beta the coronal magnetic
field can usually be assumed to be approximately force free, with electric
currents flowing along the magnetic field lines. There are both observational
and theoretical reasons which suggest that at least prior to an eruption the
coronal magnetic field is in a nonlinear force free state. Unfortunately the
computation of nonlinear force free fields is way more difficult than potential
or linear force free fields and analytic solutions are not generally available.
We discuss several methods which have been proposed to compute nonlinear force
free fields and focus particularly on an optimization method which has been
suggested recently. We compare the numerical performance of a newly developed
numerical code based on the optimization method with the performance of another
code based on an MHD relaxation method if both codes are applied to the
reconstruction of a semi-analytic nonlinear force-free solution. The
optimization method has also been tested for cases where we add random noise to
the perfect boundary conditions of the analytic solution, in this way mimicking
the more realistic case where the boundary conditions are given by vector
magnetogram data. We find that the convergence properties of the optimization
method are affected by adding noise to the boundary data and we discuss
possibilities to overcome this difficulty.

at detecting a chemically related species (possibly a direct precursor), amino
acetonitrile. With the IRAM 30m telescope we carried out a complete line survey
of the hot core regions Sgr B2(N) and (M) in the 3 mm range, plus partial
surveys at 2 and 1.3 mm. We analyzed our 30m line survey in the LTE

We identified spectral features at the frequencies predicted for amino
acetonitrile lines having intensities compatible with a unique rotation
temperature. We also used the VLA to look for cold, extended emission from
amino acetonitrile. We detected amino acetonitrile in Sgr B2(N) in our 30m
telescope line survey and conducted confirmatory observations of selected lines
with the IRAM PdB and the ATCA interferometers. The emission arises from a
known hot core, the Large Molecule Heimat, and is compact with a source
diameter of 2 arcsec (0.08 pc). We derived a column density of 2.8e16 cm-2, a
temperature of 100 K, and a linewidth of 7 km s-1. Based on the simultaneously
observed continuum emission, we calculated a density of 1.7e8 cm-3, a mass of

important constraints on models of planet formation. We focus on each system's
apsidal motion and proximity to dynamical instability. Although only ~25
multiple planet systems have been discovered to date, our analyses in these
terms have revealed several important features of planetary interactions. 1)
Many systems interact such that they are near the boundary between stability
and instability. 2) Planets tend to form such that at least one planet's
eccentricity periodically drops to near zero. 3) Mean-motion resonant pairs
would be unstable if not for the resonance. 4) Scattering of approximately
equal mass planets is unlikely to produce the observed distribution of apsidal
behavior. 5) Resonant interactions may be identified through calculating a
system's proximity to instability, regardless of knowledge of angles such as
mean longitude and longitude of periastron (e.g. GJ 317 b and c are probably in
a 4:1 resonance). These properties of planetary systems have been identified
through calculation of two parameters that describe the interaction. The
apsidal interaction can be quantified by determining how close a planet is to
an apsidal separatrix (a boundary between qualitatively different types of
apsidal oscillations, e.g. libration or circulation of the major axes). The
proximity to instability can be measured by comparing the observed orbital
elements to an analytic boundary that describes a type of stability known as
Hill stability. We have set up a website dedicated to presenting the most

system typically leads to a reduction in the problem to be solved. Here we
report that neither translational invariance nor rotational invariance reduce
the computational complexity of simulating Hamiltonian dynamics; the problem is
still BQP complete, and is believed to be hard on a classical computer. This is
achieved by designing a system to implement a Universal Quantum Interface, a
device which enables control of an entire computation through the control of a
fixed number of spins, and using it as a building-block to entirely remove the
need for control, except in the system initialisation. Finally, it is shown
that cooling such Hamiltonians to their ground states in the presence of random
magnetic fields solves a QMA-complete problem.

images. In terms of image intensities, these features are elongated ridge-like
intensity maxima. To discriminate the maxima, we need information about the
spatial derivatives of the image intensity. Commonly, the derivative estimates
are strongly affected by image noise. We therefore use a regularized estimation
of the derivative which is then used to interpolate a discrete vector field of
ridge points ``ridgels'' which are positioned on the ridge center and have the
intrinsic orientation of the local ridge direction. A scheme is proposed to
connect ridgels to smooth, spline-represented curves which fit the observed
loops. Finally, a half-automated user interface allows one to merge or split,
eliminate or select loop fits obtained form the above procedure. In this paper
we apply our tool to one of the first EUV images observed by the SECCHI
instrument onboard the recently launched STEREO spacecraft. We compare the
extracted loops with projected field lines computed from
almost-simultaneously-taken magnetograms measured by the SOHO/MDI Doppler
imager. The field lines were calculated using a linear force-free field model.
This comparison allows one to verify faint and spurious loop connections
produced by our segmentation tool and it also helps to prove the quality of the
magnetic-field model where well-identified loop structures comply with
field-line projections. We also discuss further potential applications of our
tool such as loop oscillations and stereoscopy.

determined non--destructively by measuring the phase shift of an off--resonant

dispersive light--atom interaction, however, gives rise to a differential light
shift (AC Stark shift) between the atomic states which, for a nonuniform probe
intensity distribution, causes an inhomogeneous dephasing between the atoms. In
this paper, we investigate the effects of this inhomogeneous light shift in
non--destructive measurement schemes. We interpret our experimental data on
dispersively probed Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in terms of a simple
light shift model which is shown to describe the observed behavior well.
Furthermore, we show that by using spin echo techniques, the inhomogeneous
phase shift distribution between the two clock levels can be reversed.

GeV, using state-of-the art particle identification techniques. Among several
detector subsystems, AMS includes a proximity focusing RICH enabling precise
measurements of particle electric charge and velocity. The combination of both
these measurements together with the particle rigidity measured on the silicon
tracker endows a reliable measurement of the particle mass. The main topics of
the AMS-02 physics program include detailed measurements of the nuclear
component of the cosmic-ray spectrum and the search for indirect signatures of
dark matter. Mass separation of singly charged particles, and in particular the
separation of deuterons and antideuterons from massive backgrounds of protons

installed on the International Space Station (ISS) for at least 3 years, is a
detector designed to measure charged cosmic ray spectra with energies up to the
TeV region and with high energy photon detection capability up to a few hundred
GeV. It is equipped with several subsystems, one of which is a proximity
focusing RICH detector with a dual radiator (aerogel+NaF) that provides
reliable measurements for particle velocity and charge. The assembly and
testing of the AMS RICH is currently being finished and the full AMS detector
is expected to be ready by the end of 2008. The RICH detector of AMS-02 is
presented. Physics prospects are briefly discussed.

signal-to-noise ratio Keck spectra of a very highly microlensed Galactic bulge
dwarf, OGLE-2007-BLG-349S, with Teff ~ 5400 K. The amplification at the time
the spectra were taken ranged from 350 to 450. This bulge star is highly
enhanced in metallicity with [Fe/H] = +0.51 \pm 0.09 dex. The abundance ratios
for the 28 species of 26 elements for which features could be detected in the
spectra are solar. In particular, there is no evidence for enhancement of any
of the alpha-elements including O and Mg. We conclude that the high [Fe/H] seen
in this star, when combined with the equally high [Fe/H] derived in previous
detailed abundance analysis of two other Galactic bulge dwarfs, both also
microlensed, implies that the median metallicity in the Galactic bulge is very
high. We thus infer that many previous estimates of the metallicity
distribution in the Galactic bulge have substantially underestimated the mean
Fe-metallicity there due to sample bias, and suggest a candidate mechanism for
such. If our conjecture proves valid, it may be necessary to update the
calibrations for the algorithms used by many groups to interpret spectra and
broad band photometry of the integrated light of very metal-rich old stellar
populations, including luminous elliptical galaxies.

in multi-band wide field surveys on the dark energy equation of state
determination for two 3D weak lensing methods. The weak lensing methods are a
geometric shear-ratio method and 3D cosmic shear. The analysis here uses an
extension of the Fisher matrix framework to jointly include photometric
redshift systematics, shear distortion systematics and intrinsic alignments. We
present results for DUNE and Pan-STARRS surveys. We show that assuming
systematic parameters are fixed, but possibly biased, results in potentially
large biases in dark energy parameters. We quantify any potential bias by
defining a Bias Figure of Merit. We also show the effect on the dark energy
Figure of Merit of marginalising over each systematic parameter individually.
We find that the largest effect on the Figure of Merit comes from uncertainty
in the photometric redshift systematic parameters. These can reduce the Figure
of Merit by up to a factor of 2 to 4 in both 3D weak lensing methods, if no
informative prior on the systematic parameters is applied. Shear distortion
systematics have a smaller overall effect. Intrinsic alignment effects can
reduce the Figure of Merit by up to a further factor of 2. This, however, is a
worst case scenario. By including prior information on systematic parameters
the Figure of Merit can be recovered to a large extent. We conclude that, as a
rule of thumb, given a realistic current understanding of intrinsic alignments
and photometric redshifts, then including all three primary systematic effects
reduces the Figure of Merit by at most a factor of 2, but that in reality this
factor should be much less. [abridged]

disruption of satellites are among processes which lead to the formation of
fine and dense dark matter shells, also known as dark matter caustics. The
putative weakly interacting species which may form the dark matter are expected
to strongly annihilate in these dense regions of the Milky Way halo and
generate in particular antiprotons and positrons. We derive the flux of these
rare antimatter particles at the Earth and show that it depends significantly
on the cut-off radius of the dark matter distribution at the galactic centre.
Boost factors of ~30 are found with respect to a smooth NFW profile for
high-energy antiprotons and low-energy positrons if this cut-off radius is
taken to be 300 pc -- a somewhat extreme value though. This yields a detectable
antiproton signal around hundreds of Gev in models where the annihilation cross
section today is enhanced by non--perturbative effects as in the generic case
of a heavy Wino. However, dark matter caustics cannot provide a better
explanation for the HEAT excess reported above ~10 GeV than a smooth NFW or

(generally referred to as Lyman-break galaxies). Specifically, we compare the
metallicity distributions of the GRB and DLA populations to simple models where
these galaxies are drawn randomly from the distribution of star-forming
galaxies according to their star-formation rate and HI cross-section
respectively. We find that it is possible to match both observational
distributions assuming very simple and constrained relations between
luminosity, metallicity and HI sizes. The simple model can be tested by
observing the luminosity distribution of GRB host galaxies and by measuring the
luminosity and impact parameters of DLA selected galaxies as a function of
metallicity. Our results support the expectation that GRB and DLA samples, in
contrast to magnitude limited surveys, provide an almost complete census of z=3
star-forming galaxies that are not heavily dust-obscured.

transportation profoundly increasing anthropogenic nanoparticulate pollution.
The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute
size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate
these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function. Among
diseases associated with nanoparticles are asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson`s and Alzheimer`s diseases),
Crohn`s disease, colon cancer. Nanoparticles that enter the circulatory system
are related to occurrence of arteriosclerosis, and blood clots, arrhythmia,
heart diseases, and ultimately cardiac death. We show that possible adverse

genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry,
size, shape, and agglomeration state. The faster we will understand their
causes and mechanisms, the more likely we are to find cures for diseases

relativistic particle population in AGN-inflated bubbles is followed within a

in previous work, we inject a non-thermal particle population of relativistic
protons into the AGN bubbles, instead of adopting a purely thermal heating. We
then follow the subsequent evolution of the cosmic ray (CR) plasma inside the
bubbles, considering both its hydrodynamical interactions and dissipation
processes relevant for the CR population. Due to the different buoyancy of
relativistic plasma and the comparatively long CR dissipation timescale we find
substantial changes in the evolution of clusters as a result of CR feedback. In
particular, the non-thermal population can provide significant pressure support
in central cluster regions at low thermal temperatures, providing a natural
explanation for the decreasing temperature profiles found in cool core
clusters. At the same time, the morphologies of the bubbles and of the induced
X-ray cavities show a striking similarity to observational findings. AGN
feedback with CRs also proves efficient in regulating cluster cooling flows so
that the total baryon fraction in stars becomes limited to realistic values of
the order of 10%. We find that the partial CR support of the intracluster gas
also affects the expected signal of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with
typical modifications of the integrated Compton-y parameter within the virial

applications we would rather have properties that are independent of

is to consider a large sample of galaxies, study how the observed properties of
these galaxies depend on inclination and then remove this dependence to recover
the intrinsic properties. We perform such an analysis for galaxies selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which have been matched to galaxies from the
Two-Micron All Sky Survey. We determine inclination corrections for these
galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity and Sersic index. In the g-band
these corrections reach as as high as 1.2 mag and have a median value of 0.3

going from observed to intrinsic colors for galaxies in the range -22.75 < M_K

should be determined when taking into account that observed and intrinsic
properties differ. Finally, we examine whether previous determinations of

of the effective average action to quantum gravity. Insisting on a background
independent renormalization group (RG) flow the coarse graining operation must
be defined in terms of an unspecified variable metric since no rigid metric of
a fixed background spacetime is available. This leads to an extra field
dependence in the functional RG equation and a significantly different RG flow
in comparison to the standard flow equation with a rigid metric in the mode
cutoff. The background independent RG flow can possess a non-Gaussian fixed
point, for instance, even though the corresponding standard one does not. We
demonstrate the importance of this universal, essentially kinematical effect by
computing the RG flow of Quantum Einstein Gravity in the ``conformally
reduced'' Einstein--Hilbert approximation which discards all degrees of freedom
contained in the metric except the conformal one. Without the extra field
dependence the resulting RG flow is that of a simple $\phi^4$-theory. Including
it one obtains a flow with exactly the same qualitative properties as in the
full Einstein--Hilbert truncation. In particular it possesses the non-Gaussian
fixed point which is necessary for asymptotic safety.

We also find strongly suppressed accretion in the magnetised runs, leading to
up to a 75% reduction in the amount of mass converted into stars over the
course of the calculations and a more quiescent mode of star formation. There
is also some indication that the relative formation efficiency of brown dwarfs
is lower in the strongly magnetised runs due to the reduction in the importance
of protostellar ejections.

transient contributions to the background dynamics have not been erased, modes
near horizon-crossing can acquire significant non-Gaussianities. Secondly,
potentials with small-scale structure may induce significant non-Gaussianities
while the relevant modes are deep inside the horizon. The first case includes
the ""step"" potential we previously analyzed while the second ""resonance"" case
is novel. We derive analytic approximations for the 3-point terms generated by
both mechanisms written as products of functions of the three individual

first of three seasons of data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. For this
measurement, we include 17 SNe Ia at redshift $z\le0.12$. Assuming a flat
cosmology with $\Omega_m = 0.3=1-\Omega_\Lambda$, we find a volumetric SN Ia
rate of $[2.93^{+0.17}_{-0.04}({\rm systematic})^{+0.90}_{-0.71}({\rm
statistical})] \times 10^{-5} {\rm SNe} {\rm Mpc}^{-3} h_{70}^3 {\rm
year}^{-1}$, at a volume-weighted mean redshift of 0.09. This result is
consistent with previous measurements of the SN Ia rate in a similar redshift
range. The systematic errors are well controlled, resulting in the most precise
measurement of the SN Ia rate in this redshift range. We use a maximum
likelihood method to fit SN rate models to the SDSS-II Supernova Survey data in
combination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for the
redshift-evolution of the SN Ia rate. Fitting the combined data to a simple
power-law evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate, $r_V \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$,
we obtain a value of $\beta = 1.5 \pm 0.6$, i.e. the SN Ia rate is determined
to be an increasing function of redshift at the $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ level.
Fitting the results to a model in which the volumetric SN rate,
$r_V=A\rho(t)+B\dot \rho(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the stellar mass density and
$\dot \rho(t)$ is the star formation rate, we find $A = (2.8 \pm 1.2) \times
10^{-14} \mathrm{SNe} \mathrm{M}_{\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, $B =

with shocks for a hot polytropic gas flow in a cluster of galaxies in the
presence of a massive dark matter (DM) flow after the initiation of a
gravitational core collapse or a central AGN activity or a large-scale merging
process. In particular, the possibility of DM shocks or sharp jumps of mass
density and of velocity dispersion in dark matter halo is discussed and such DM
shocks might be detectable through gravitational lensing effects. To examine
various plausible scenarios for clusters of galaxies, we describe three
possible classes of shock flows within our model framework for different types
of temperature, density and flow speed profiles. Depending upon sensible model
parameters and shock locations, the hot ICM and DM halo may have various
combinations of asymptotic behaviours of outflow, breeze, inflow, contraction
or static envelopes at large radii at a given time. We refer to asymptotic
outflows of hot ICM at large radii as the galaxy cluster wind. As a result of
such galaxy cluster winds and simultaneous contractions of DM halo during the
course of galaxy cluster evolution, there would be less hot ICM within clusters
of galaxies as compared to the average baryon fraction in the Universe.

protoplanet in detail. We find that the gas flows onto the protoplanet system
in the vertical direction crossing the shock front near the Hill radius of the
protoplanet, which is qualitatively different from the picture established by
two-dimensional simulations. The specific angular momentum of the gas accreted
by the protoplanet system increases with the protoplanet mass. At Jovian orbit,
when the protoplanet mass M_p is M_p < 1 M_J, where M_J is Jovian mass, the
specific angular momentum increases as j \propto M_p. On the other hand, it
increases as j \propto M_p^2/3 when the protoplanet mass is M_p > 1 M_J. The
stronger dependence of the specific angular momentum on the protoplanet mass
for M_p < 1 M_J is due to thermal pressure of the gas. The estimated total
angular momentum of a system of a gas giant planet and a circumplanetary disk
is two-orders of magnitude larger than those of the present gas giant planets
in the solar system. A large fraction of the total angular momentum contributes
to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. We also discuss the satellite

spectral excess, a mild reflection hump, and a weakly broadened iron line. A
comparison with the Suzaku data on GRO J1655-40 reveals several interesting
spectral differences, which can mostly be attributed to inclination effects
assuming that the disk has a flat geometry while the corona is grossly
spherical. An intensity-sorted spectroscopy indicates that the continuum
becomes less Comptonized when the source flares up on times scales of 1-200 s,
while the underlying disk remains unchanged.

(FLRW) cosmologies. We prove rigorously that relative deviations of the local
covariant scalars from the QL scalars are non-linear, gauge invariant and
covariant perturbations on a FLRW formal ""background"" given by the QL scalars.
The dynamics of LTB spacetimes is completely determined by the QL scalars and
these exact perturbations. Since LTB spacetimes are compatible with a wide
variety of ""equations of state"", either single fluids or mixtures, a large
number of known solutions with dark matter and dark energy sources in a FLRW
framework (or with linear perturbations) can be readily examined under
idealized but non-trivial inhomogeneous conditions. Coordinate choices and
initial conditions are derived for a numerical treatment of the perturbation
equations, allowing us to study non-linear effects in a variety of phenomena,
such as gravitational collapse, non-local effects, void formation, dark matter
and dark energy couplings and particle creation. In particular, the embedding
of inhomogeneous regions can be performed by a smooth matching with a suitable
FLRW solution, thus generalizing the Newtonian ""top hat"" models that are widely
used in astrophysical literature. As examples of the application of the
formalism, we examine numerically the formation of a black hole in an expanding
Chaplygin gas FLRW universe, as well as the evolution of density clumps and

evolution of the planetary nebula NGC7027. We find significant evolution of the
spectral flux densities. The flux density at 1465 MHz, where the nebula is
optically thick, is increasing at a rate of 0.251+-0.015 % per year, caused by
the expansion of the ionized nebula. At frequencies where the emission is
optically thin, the spectral flux density is changing at a rate of
-0.145+-0.005 % per year, caused by a decrease in the number of ionizing
photons coming from the central star. A distance of 980+-100 pc is derived. By
fitting interpolated models of post-AGB evolution to the observed changes, we
find that over the 25-yr monitoring period, the stellar temperature has
increased by 3900+-900 K and the stellar bolometric luminosity has decreased by
1.75+-0.38 %. We derive a distance-independent stellar mass of 0.655+-0.01
solar masses adopting the Bloecker stellar evolution models, or about 0.04
solar masses higher when using models of Vassiliadis & Wood which may provide a
better fit. A Cloudy photoionization model is used to fit all epochs at all
frequencies simultaneously. The differences between the radio flux density
predictions and the observed values show some time-independent residuals of
typically 1 %. A possible explanation is inaccuracies in the radio flux scale
of Baars et al. We propose an adjustment to the flux density scale of the
primary radio flux calibrator 3C286, based on the Cloudy model of NGC7027. We
also calculate precise flux densities for NGC7027 for all standard continuum

  Y.S. Sun & S. Ferraz-Mello, eds. in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Planet searches around evolved giant stars are bringing new insights to
planet formation theories by virtue of the broader stellar mass range of the
host stars compared to the solar-type stars that have been the subject of most
current planet searches programs. These searches among giant stars are
producing extremely interesting results. Contrary to main sequence stars
planet-hosting giants do not show a tendency of being more metal rich. Even if
limited, the statistics also suggest a higher frequency of giant planets (at
least 10 %) that are more massive compared to solar-type main sequence stars.
The interpretation of these results is not straightforward. We propose that the
lack of a metallicity-planet connection among giant stars is due to pollution
of the star while on the main sequence, followed by dilution during the giant
phase. We also suggest that the higher mass and frequency of the planets are
due to the higher stellar mass. Even if these results do not favor a specific
formation scenario, they suggest that planetary formation might be more complex
than what has been proposed so far, perhaps with two mechanisms at work and one
or the other dominating according to the stellar mass. We finally stress as the
detailed study of the host stars and of the parent sample is essential to
derive firm conclusions.

an inertially-driven von Karman flow between two counter-rotating large
impellers fitted with curved blades over a wide range of Reynolds number (100 -
1 000 000). The transition is driven by the destabilisation of the azimuthal
shear-layer, i.e., Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which exhibits
travelling/drifting waves, modulated travelling waves and chaos below the
emergence of a turbulent spectrum. A local quantity -the energy of the velocity
fluctuations at a given point- and a global quantity -the applied torque- are
used to monitor the dynamics. The local quantity defines a critical Reynolds
number Rec for the onset of time-dependence in the flow, and an upper
threshold/crossover Ret for the saturation of the energy cascade. The
dimensionless drag coefficient, i.e., the turbulent dissipation, reaches a
plateau above this finite Ret, as expected for a ""Kolmogorov""-like turbulence

in this closed flow is globally supercritical: the energy of the velocity
fluctuations can be considered as an order parameter characterizing the
dynamics from the first laminar time-dependence up to the fully developed
turbulence. Spectral analysis in temporal domain moreover reveals that almost
all of the fluctuations energy is stored in time-scales one or two orders of

origin. By that it is meant a new investigation that includes several
extensions of the traditional framework of Doplicher, Haag and Roberts in local
quantum theories. At first we generalize the notion of representations of nets
of C*-algebras, then we provide a brand new view on selection criteria by
adopting one with a strong topological flavour. We prove that it is coherent
with the older point of view, hence a clue to a genuine extension. In this
light, we extend Roberts' cohomological analysis to the case where 1--cocycles
bear non trivial unitary representations of the fundamental group of the
spacetime, equivalently of its Cauchy surface in case of global hyperbolicity.
A crucial tool is a notion of group von Neumann algebras generated by the
1-cocycles evaluated on loops over fixed regions. One proves that these group
von Neumann algebras are localized at the bounded region where loops start and
end and to be factorial of finite type I. All that amounts to a new invariant,
in a topological sense, which can be defined as the dimension of the factor. We
prove that any 1-cocycle can be factorized into a part that contains only the
charge content and another where only the topological information is stored.
This second part resembles much what in literature are known as geometric
phases. Indeed, by the very geometrical origin of the 1-cocycles that we
discuss in the paper, they are essential tools in the theory of net bundles,
and the topological part is related to their holonomy content. At the end we
prove the existence of net representations.

Nernst signal was found to be negative, large, and, as a function of magnetic
field, nonlinear. Its magnitude increases with the decreasing temperature until
reaching a maximum around $T^*$ $\approx$ 20 - 25 K, below which it starts to
decrease linearly as a function of temperature. The large value of the Nernst
signal appears to be related to the multiband nature of the normal state and
the nonlinearity to band-dependent magnetic fluctuation in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$.
We argue that the sharp decrease in Nernst signal below $T^*$ is due to the
suppression of quasiparticle scattering and the emergence of band-dependent
coherence in the normal state. The observation of a sharp kink in the
temperature dependent thermopower around $T^*$ and a sharp drop of Hall angle
at low temperatures provide additional support to this picture.

we prove that if a discrete dictionary reaches a minimal density criterion,

to a weakened hypothetical continuous MP. Interestingly, the corresponding
weakness factor depends on a density measure of the discrete dictionary.
Second, we show that the insertion of a simple geometric gradient ascent

with a weakness factor at least two times closer to unity than without
optimization. Finally, we present numerical experiments confirming our
theoretical predictions for decomposition of signals and images on regular

electron density distribution within the bulk. In order to show the relevance

model of electronic stopping, we employ highly-resolved \emph{ab-initio}
electron density data to describe the conversion of kinetic energy into
excitation energy along the ion track. The primary particle dynamics are
obtained via integration of the Newtonian equations of motion that are governed
by a space- and time-dependent friction force originating from Lindhard
stopping. The analysis of the local electronic stopping power along the ion
track reveals a pronounced periodic structure. The periodicity length strongly
varies with the particular choice of the polar angle of incidence and is
directly correlated to the experimentally observed formation of periodic
nanodots at insulator surfaces.

  Pages:32, Figures:15",,,,"q-bio.TO",,"  Tissue Engineering concerns the three-dimensional cell growth so that
bio-artificial tissues could be created and used for transplantation. The
recently expressed concerns from the Tissue Engineering research community for
a re-direction of the research activities necessitate the proposition of new
methodologies. We propose a methodology that has to do with the simulation in
bioreactor systems of liver structures as are described in liver anatomy. I
this way the hepatocyte microenvironments that determine their function could
be re-created in vitro. The approach needs the use of hepatocyte aggregates as
entities to load the bioreactor systems. A new bioreactor, the microgravity
simulating rotation bioreactor, has been used for the preparation of cell
aggregates. Microcontact printing has been used to produce a patterned
surfaces. They were tested adsorbing BSA proteins, and will be used in future
for the mmobilization of cell aggregates in order to gain further understanding
of the role of cell heterogeneity in the cooperative behaviour of cells in
vitro.

has been recently investigated by Girardi and coworkers by means of Monte Carlo
simulations [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{126}, 064503 (2007)], with the aim of
describing water anomalies. We develop an approximate semi-analytical
calculation, based on a cluster-variation technique, which turns out to
reproduce almost quantitatively different thermodynamic properties and phase
transitions determined by the Monte Carlo method. Nevertheless, our calculation
points out the existence of two different phases characterized by long-range
orientational order, and of critical transitions between them and to a
high-temperature orientationally-disordered phase. Also, the existence of such
critical lines allows us to explain certain ``kinks'' in the isotherms and
isobars determined by the Monte Carlo analysis. The picture of the phase
diagram becomes much more complex and richer, though unfortunately less
suitable to describe real water.

orientifold may be used to construct the supersymmetric Standard Model. If
$a,b$ are the stacks that generate the SU(3)_{colour} and SU(2)_L gauge
particles, then, in order to obtain just the chiral spectrum of the
(supersymmetric) Standard Model (with non-zero Yukawa couplings to the Higgs
mutiplets),it is necessary that the number of intersections $a \cap b$ of the
stacks $a$ and $b$, and the number of intersections $a \cap b'$ of $a$ with the
orientifold image $b'$ of $b$ satisfy $(a \cap b,a \cap b')=(2,1)$ or $(1,2)$.
It is also necessary that there is no matter in symmetric representations of
the gauge group, and not too much matter in antisymmetric representations, on
either stack. Fractional branes having all of these properties may be
constructed on the Z_6' orientifold. We provide a number of new examples having
these properties, some of which may be extended to give the Standard Model
spectrum. Specifically, we construct four-stack models with two further stacks,
each with just a single brane, which have the matter spectrum of the
supersymmetric Standard Model, including a single pair of Higgs doublets, {\em
plus} three right-chiral neutrino singlets. Ramond-Ramond tadpole cancellation
is achieved by the introduction of background H_3 flux, the 3-form field
strength associated with the Kalb-Ramond 2-form field B_2. There remains a
single unwanted gauged U(1)_{B-L}.

multiples of the mass difference between a neutral pion and a muon, the first
excitation within the elementary particle mass spectrum. This is found to be
equally true for the mass intervals amongst the particles belonging to the
multiplets having different spin and parity characteristics. The results
reinforce our earlier contention that the mass difference between a neutral
pion and a muon is of fundamental importance to the elementary particle mass
distribution.

two-dimensional granular silo similar to the classical system of Janssen.
Models like that of Janssen predict that pressure within a silo saturates with
depth as the result of vertical forces being redirected to the walls of the
silo where they can then be carried by friction. By averaging ensembles of
experimentally-obtained force networks in different ways, we compare the
observed behavior with various predictions for granular silos. We identify
several differences between the mean behavior in our system and that predicted
by Janssen-like models: We find that the redirection parameter describing how
the force network transfers vertical forces to the walls varies with depth. We
find that changes in the preparation of the material can cause the pressure
within the silo to either saturate or to continue building with depth. Most
strikingly, we observe a non-linear response to overloads applied to the top of
the material in the silo. For larger overloads we observe the previously
reported ""giant overshoot"" effect where overload pressure decays only after an
initial increase [G. Ovarlez et al., Phys. Rev. E 67, 060302(R) (2003)]. For
smaller overloads we find that additional pressure propagates to great depth.
This effect depends on the particle stiffness, as given for instance by the
Young's modulus, E, of the material from which the particles are made.
Important measures include E, the unscreened hydrostatic pressure, and the
applied load. These experiments suggest that when the load and the particle
weight are comparable, particle elasticity acts to stabilize the force network,
allowing non-linear network effects to be seen in the mean behavior.

interactions relies on the Hartree-Fock approximation so as to achieve system
sizes comparable to experimental situations. Our results clearly exhibit
manifestations of various interaction-mediated features, such as non-linear
screening, local charging, and g-factor enhancement, implying the inadequacy of
independent-particle models for comparison with experimental results.

fields are studied in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole with a

SBHGM decreases as the symmetry breaking scale parameter $H$ increases but
imaginary part increases instead. For large overtone number $n$, these QNMs
become evenly spaced and the spacing for the imaginary part equals to
$-i(1-H)^{3/2}/(4M)$ which is dependent of $H$ but independent of the quantum
number $l$. It is surprisingly found that the late-time behavior is dominated
by an inverse power-law tail $t^{-2[1+\sqrt{(s+1/2)^{2}+ (l-s)(l+s+1)/(1-H)}]}$
for each $l$, and as $H\to0$ it reduces to the Schwarzschild case $t^{-(2l+3)}$
