of dark matter, on searches for energetic neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in
the Sun and Earth, and on the enhancement in the WIMP annihilation rate in the
halo. Our central result is a probability distribution function (PDF) P(\rho)
for the local dark-matter density. This distribution must be taken into account
when using null dark-matter searches to constrain the properties of dark-matter
candidates. We take two approaches to calculating the PDF. The first is an
analytic model that capitalizes on the scale-invariant nature of the
structure--formation hierarchy in order to address early stages in the
hierarchy (very small scales; high densities). Our second approach uses
simulation-inspired results to describe the PDF that arises from lower-density
larger-scale substructures which formed in more recent stages in the merger
hierarchy. The distributions are skew positive, and they peak at densities
lower than the mean density. The local dark-matter density may be as small as
1/10th the canonical value of ~ 0.4 GeV/cm^3, but it is probably no less than
0.2 GeV/cm^3.

constant forcing and its continuum limit(s) to model a 0-$\pi$ Josephson
junction with an applied bias current. The continuum limits correspond to the
strong coupling limit of the discrete system. The non-autonomous character is
due to the presence of a discontinuity point, namely a jump of $\pi$ in the
sine-Gordon phase. The continuum models admits static solitary waves which are
called $\pi$-kinks and are attached to the discontinuity point. For small
forcing, there are three types of $\pi$-kinks. We show that one of the kinks is
stable and the others are unstable. There is a critical value of the forcing
beyond all static $\pi$-kinks fail to exist. Up to this value, the
(in)stability of the $\pi$-kinks can be established analytically in the strong
coupling limits. Applying a forcing above the critical value causes the
nucleation of $2\pi$-kinks and -antikinks. Besides a $\pi$-kink, the unforced
system also admits a static $3\pi$-kink. This state is unstable in the
continuum models. By combining analytical and numerical methods in the discrete
model, it is shown that the stable $\pi$-kink remains stable, and that the
unstable $\pi$-kinks cannot be stabilized by decreasing the coupling. The
$3\pi$-kink does become stable in the discrete model when the coupling is
sufficiently weak.

in perfect agreement with the existence of the maximum length scale in nature.

situations where the quantum evolution can be approximated by quantum-classical

be reduced to surface-hopping dynamics, where the evolution consists of
trajectory segments evolving exclusively on single adiabatic surfaces, with
probabilistic hops between these surfaces. The justification for the reduction
depends on the validity of a Markovian approximation on a bath averaged memory
kernel that accounts for quantum coherence in the system. We show that such a
reduction is often possible when initial sampling is from either the quantum or

Monte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data
and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 10^5
models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and
kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability
distribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the Sersic index
of the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We
also calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter
velocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for
terrestrial dark matter detection experiments.

observational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters
and therefore respond differently to non-axisymmetric perturbations. We
simulate the evolution of twenty-five models which have different Toomre Q and
Goldreich-Tremaine X parameters. Virtually all of these models form a bar,
though some, more quickly than others. The bar pattern speeds are ~ 40 - 50
km/s/kpc at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to
coupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed

  Nov.2007",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The variation of TO zone-center vibration spectra with concentration in mixed
zincblende-type semiconductors can be understood within a paradigm of unified
""one bond - two modes"" approach, which has been recently outlined as a rather
general concept, and emerges from a number of previous experimental and
theoretical studies. The crucial issue is that the vibration frequency,
associated with a certain cation-anion bond, depends on the length of the
latter, and the bond length, in its turn, depends not only on the average alloy
concentration, but on local variations of it. In an (A,B)C substitutional
alloy, the A-C bond length differ in A-rich and A-poor regions, yielding a
splitting of the A-C vibration frequency. Such splittings can be measured and
reproduced in first-principles calculations.
  An analysis of vibration spectra helps to get an insight into the structural
short-range (clustering) and long-range (formation of extended chains of
certain cation-anion pairs and other structural motives at the mesoscopic
scale) tendencies. For this however, one needs first-principles benchmark
calculations for representative model systems. The simplest yet important
result from first-principles calculations is a prediction of how the impurity
phonon mode evolves as isolated (distant) impurities get clustered.

progressive collapse of the normal-metal-like FS into four disconnected nodal

sample is unbiased with respect to cluster dynamical state, and it fully
samples the cluster X-ray luminosity function. The clusters cover a temperature
range of 2.0 -- 8.5 keV and possess a variety of morphologies. The sampling
strategy allows us to compare clusters with a wide range of central cooling
times on an equal footing. We present non-parametric gas-density profiles out
to distances ranging between 0.8 R_500 and 1.5 R_500. The central gas densities
differ greatly from system to system, with no clear correlation with system
temperature. At intermediate radii the scaled density profiles show much less
scatter, with a clear dependence on system temperature, consistent with the
presence of an entropy excess as suggested in previous literature. However, at
large scaled radii this dependence becomes weaker: clusters with kT > 3 keV
scale self-similarly, with no temperature dependence of gas-density
normalisation. We find some evidence of a correlation between dynamical state
and outer gas density slope, and between dynamical state and both central gas
normalisation and cooling time. We find no evidence of a significant bimodality
in the distributions of central density, density gradient, or cooling time.
Finally, we present the gas mass-temperature relation for the REXCESS sample,

of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking by
the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation. We show that
the absence of observed stable luminous LMBHB implies that upon RLOF by the
low-mass donor angular momentum losses are substantially reduced with respect
to the Verbunt and Zwaan ""standard"" prescription for magnetic braking. Under
this assumption masses and effective temperatures of the model secondaries of
LMBHB are in a satisfactory agreement with the masses and effective
temperatures (as inferred from their spectra) of the observed donors in LMBHB.
Theoretical mass-transfer rates in SXTs are consistent with the observed ones
if one assumes that accretion discs in these systems are truncated (""leaky"").
We find that the population of short-period SXT is formed mainly by systems
which had unevolved or slightly evolved (X_c > 0.35) donors at the RLOF. Longer
period (0.5 - 1 day) SXT might descend from systems with initial donor mass
about 1 solar and X_c < 0.35. It is unnecessary to invoke donors with almost
hydrogen-depleted cores to explain the origin of LMBHB. Our models suggest that
a very high efficiency of common-envelopes ejection is necessary to form LMBHB,
unless currently commonly accepted empirical estimates of mass-loss rates by
winds for pre-WR and WR-stars are significantly over-evaluated.

a telephone rather than a personal interview, and by the presence of a spouse

small deviations in the concentration of multivalent ions away from the neutral

parabolically with the logarithm of the ratio of multivalent ion concentration

profile rises with radius in the outer parts of the galaxy, from ~0.7keV at

and the temperature peaks at ~1.1keV within the innermost 200pc. Under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we demonstrate that the central
temperature spike arises due to the gravitational influence of a quiescent
central super-massive black hole. We constrain the black hole mass (MBH) to
$(3.35^{+0.67}_{-0.95})\times 10^9$Msun (90% confidence), in good agreement
with stellar kinematics measurements. This is the first direct measurement of
MBH based on studies of hydrostatic X-ray emitting gas, which are sensitive to
the most massive black holes, and is a crucial validation of both
mass-determination techniques. This agreement clearly demonstrates the gas must
be close to hydrostatic, even in the very centre of the galaxy, which is
consistent with the lack of morphological disturbances in the X-ray image.
NGC4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which MBH has been
measured by more than one method. At larger radii, we were able to decompose
the gravitating mass profile into stellar and dark matter (DM) components.
Unless one accounts for the DM, a standard Virial analysis of the stars
dramatically over-estimates the stellar mass of the galaxy. We find the

incorporates negative feedback with a delay. When the feedback is
instantaneous, solutions approach a self-limiting equilibrium state. When there
is a delay, even though the feedback is negative, the solutions can exhibit
cyclic and episodic solutions. We find that periodic or episodic star formation
only occurs when two conditions are satisfied. Firstly the delay timescale must
exceed a cloud consumption timescale. Secondly the feedback must be strong.
This statement is quantitatively equivalent to requiring that the timescale to
approach equilibrium be greater than approximately twice the cloud consumption
timescale. The period of oscillations predicted is approximately 4 times the
delay timescale. The amplitude of the oscillations increases with both feedback
strength and delay time.
  We discuss applications of the delay differential equation (DDE) model to
star formation in galaxies using the cloud density as a variable. The DDE model
is most applicable to systems that recycle gas and only slowly remove gas from
the system. We propose likely delay mechanisms based on the requirement that
the delay time is related to the observationally estimated time between
episodic events. The proposed delay timescale accounting for episodic star
formation in galaxy centers on periods similar to P 10 Myrs, irregular galaxies
with P 100 Myrs, and the Milky Way disk with P~ 2Gyr, could be that for
exciting turbulence following creation of massive stars, that for gas pushed
into the halo to return and interact with the disk and that for spiral density
wave evolution, respectively.

high pass filter preventing low velocity HVS from reaching the halo. To trace
the orbits of HVS throughout the Galaxy, we construct two forms of the
potential which reasonably represent the observations in the range 5--100,000
pc, a simple spherically symmetric model and a bulge-disk-halo model. We use
the Hills mechanism (disruption of binaries by the tidal field of the central
black hole) to inject HVS into the Galaxy and compute the observable spatial
and velocity distributions of HVS with masses in the range 0.6--4 Msun. These
distributions reflect the mass function in the Galactic Center, properties of
binaries in the Galactic Center, and aspects of stellar evolution and the
injection mechanism. For 0.6--4 Msun main sequence stars, the fraction of
unbound HVS and the asymmetry of the velocity distribution for their bound
counterparts increases with stellar mass. The density profiles for unbound HVS
decline with distance from the Galactic Center approximately as r^{-2} (but are
steeper for the most massive stars which evolve off the main sequence during
their travel time from the Galactic Center); the density profiles for the bound
ejecta decline with distance approximately as r^{-3}. In a survey with a
limiting visual magnitude V of 23, the detectability of HVS (unbound or bound)
increases with stellar mass.

We consider two kinds of contributions to the EPI; the EPI originating from the
Coulomb potential of O ions and that originating from the d-p transfer integral
between Co and O in CoO_6 octahedron. We find that the EPI for shear phonons,
which induces the interorbital hopping of electrons, is large in NaxCoO_2
because of the trigonal distortion of CoO_2 layer. For this reason, Tc for
s-wave pairing is prominently enlarged owing to interorbital hopping of Cooper
pairs induced by shear phonons, even if the top of e_g' electron band is close
to but below the Fermi level as suggested experimentally. This mechanism of
superconductivity is referred to as the valence-band Suhl-Kondo (SK) mechanism.
Since the SK mechanism is seldom damaged by the Coulomb repulsion, s-wave
superconductivity is realized irrespective of large Coulomb interaction U~5 eV
at Co sites. We also study the oxygen isotope effect on Tc, and find that it
becomes very small due to strong Coulomb interaction. Finally, we discuss the
possible mechanism of anisotropic s-wave superconducting state in NaxCoO2,
resulting from the coexistence of strong EPI and the antiferromagnetic

Kazamaki's quadratic critical exponent $b(M)$ of a BMO martingale $M$ and the

limited feedback. Our work builds on recent results that have established the
possibility of significant capacity gains in the wideband/low-SNR regime when
there is perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter.
Furthermore, the perfect CSI benchmark gain can be obtained with the feedback
of just one bit per channel coefficient. However, the input signals used in
these methods are peaky, that is, they have a large peak-to-average power
ratios. Signal peakiness is related to channel coherence and many recent
measurement campaigns show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, wideband
channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure that naturally leads to coherence
in time and frequency. In this work, we first show that even an instantaneous
power constraint is sufficient to achieve the benchmark gain when perfect CSI
is available at the receiver. In the more realistic non-coherent setting, we
study the performance of a training-based signaling scheme. We show that
multipath sparsity can be leveraged to achieve the benchmark gain under both
average as well as instantaneous power constraints as long as the channel
coherence scales at a sufficiently fast rate with signal space dimensions. We
also present rules of thumb on choosing signaling parameters as a function of
the channel parameters so that the full benefits of sparsity can be realized.

$L^2$ and $H^1$ global well-posedness for any subcritical nonlinearity (in
contrast with the Euclidean case) and with no gauge invariance assumption on
the nonlinearity $F$. On the other hand, if $F$ is gauge invariant, $L^2$
charge is conserved and hence, as in the Euclidean case, it is possible to
extend local $L^2$ solutions to global ones. The corresponding argument in
$H^1$ requires the conservation of energy, which holds under the stronger
condition that $F$ is defocusing. Recall that global well-posedness in the
gauge invariant case was already proved by Banica, Carles & Staffilani, for
small radial $L^2$ data and for large radial $H^1$ data. The second important
application of our global Strichartz estimates is ""scattering"" for NLS both in
$L^2$ and in $H^1$, with no radial or gauge invariance assumption. Notice that,
in the Euclidean case, this is only possible for the critical power
$\gamma=1+\frac4n$ and can be false for subcritical powers while, on hyperbolic
spaces, global existence and scattering of small $L^2$ solutions holds for all
powers $1<\gamma\le1+\frac4n$. If we restrict to defocusing nonlinearities $F$,
we can extend the $H^1$ scattering results of Banica, Carles & Staffilani to

low-complexity maps that can rotate and scale submanifolds on the Grassmann

radio continuum map of NGC 253 obtained from combined VLA and Effelsberg
observations at lambda 6.2 cm. We find a prominent radio halo with a
scaleheight of the thick radio disk of 1.7 kpc. The linear dependence between
the local scaleheight of the vertical continuum emission and the cosmic ray
electron (CRE) lifetime requires a vertical CR bulk speed of 270 km s^-1. The
magnetic field structure of NGC 253 resembles an ``X''-shaped configuration
where the orientation of the large-scale magnetic field is plane-parallel only
in the inner regions of the disk and at small distances from the galactic
midplane. At larger galactocentric radii and further away from the midplane the
vertical component becomes important. This is most clearly visible at the
location of the ``radio spur'' southeast of the nucleus, where the magnetic
field orientation is almost vertical. We made a simple model for the dominant
toroidal (r,phi) magnetic field component using a spiral magnetic field with
prescribed inclination and pitch angle. The residual poloidal (r,phi,z)
magnetic field component which was revealed by subtracting the model from the
observations shows a distinct ``X''-shaped magnetic field orientation centered
on the nucleus. The orientation angle of the poloidal magnetic field is
consistent with a magnetic field transport described by the superposition of
the vertical CR bulk speed and the rotation velocity. Hence, we propose a disk
wind which transports cosmic rays, magnetic field, and (partially) ionized gas
from the disk into the halo.

debated. On WTTS the variability is fairly simple and attributed to long-lived,
ubiquitous cool spots. We investigate the long term variability of WTTS,
extending up to 20 years in some cases, characterize it statistically and
discuss its implications for our understanding of these stars. We have obtained
a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements for WTTS extending
up to 20 years. It contains more than 9 000 UBV R observations of 48 WTTS. All
the data were collected at Mount Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and they
constitute the longest homogeneous record of accurate WTTS photometry ever
assembled. Definitive rotation periods for 35 of the 48 stars are obtained.
Phased light curves over 5 to 20 seasons are now available for analysis. Light
curve shapes, amplitudes and colour variations are obtained for this sample and
various behaviors exhibited, discussed and interpreted. Our main conclusion is
that most WTTS have very stable long term variability with relatively small
changes of amplitude or mean light level. The long term variability seen
reflects modulation in the cold spot distributions. Photometric periods are
stable over many years, and the phase of minimum light can be stable as well
for several years. On the long term, spot properties do change in subtle ways,
leading to secular variations in the shape and amplitudes of the light curves.

power-law tail, indicating a rapid drop in the average travel time as a
function of hub density. This power-law tail arises as a consequence of the
log-normal distribution of travel times seen at high hub densities. When many
messages travel on the lattice, a congestion-decongestion transition can be
seen. The waiting times of messages in the congested phase show a Gaussian

applications. We present a statistical analysis of probabilistic counting
algorithms, focusing on two techniques that use pseudo-random variates to form
low-dimensional data sketches. We apply conventional statistical methods to
compare probabilistic algorithms based on storing either selected order
statistics, or random projections. We derive estimators of the cardinality in
both cases, and show that the maximal-term estimator is recursively computable
and has exponentially decreasing error bounds. Furthermore, we show that the
estimators have comparable asymptotic efficiency, and explain this result by
demonstrating an unexpected connection between the two approaches.

indicate a hadronic origin for HESSJ1801-233 and HESSJ1800-240, and several
cloud components in projection may contribute to the VHE emission. The clouds
have components covering a broad velocity range encompassing the distance
estimates for W28 (~2 kpc), and extending up to ~4 kpc. Assuming a hadronic
origin, and distances of 2 and 4 kpc for cloud components, the required cosmic
ray density enhancement factors (with respect to the solar value) are in the
range ~10 to ~30. If situated at 2 kpc distance, such cosmic ray densities may
be supplied by a SNR like W28. Additionally and/or alternatively, particle
acceleration may come from several catalogued SNRs and SNR candidates, the
energetic ultra compact HII region W28A2, and the HII regions M8 and M20 along

potential. The potential is derived from an N-body calculation and leads to a
multi-armed time-evolving pattern. The gas forms long spiral arms typical of
grand design galaxies, although the spiral pattern is asymmetric. The primary
difference from a grand-design spiral galaxy, which has a consistent 2/4-armed
pattern, is that instead of passing through the spiral arms, gas generally
falls into a developing potential minimum and is released only when the local
minimum dissolves. In this case, the densest gas is coincident with the spiral
potential, rather than offset as in the grand-design spirals. We would there
fore expect no offset between the spiral shock and star formation, and no
obvious co-rotation radius. Spurs which occur in grand-design spirals when
large clumps are sheared off leaving the spiral arms, are rare in the active,
time-evolving spiral reported here. Instead, large branches are formed from
spiral arms when the underlying spiral potential is dissolving due to the
N-body dynamics. We find that the molecular cloud mass spectrum for the active
potential is similar to that for clouds in grand design calculations, depending
primarily on the ambient pressure rather than the nature of the potential. The
largest molecular clouds occur when spiral arms collide, rather than by
agglomeration within a spiral arm.

whereas IRS 63 is consistent with a point source down to a scale of 3 arcsec

0.055 and >= 0.007 MSun and envelope masses of 0.058 and >= 0.058 MSun are
empirically determined for IRS 63 and Elias 29, respectively. The disk+envelope
systems are modelled with the axisymmetric radiative-transfer code RADMC,
yielding disk and envelope masses that differ from the empirical results by
factors of a few. HCO+ J = 3-2 is detected toward both sources, HCN J = 3-2 is

that the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the SMA at 1.1 mm allow a good
separation of the disks around Class I YSOs from their circumstellar envelopes
and environments, and the spectral resolution makes it possible to resolve
their dynamical structure and estimate the masses of the central stars. The
ratios of the envelope and disk masses are found to be 0.2 and 6 for IRS 63 and

show that the exact and approximate wave functions globally give similar

the inclusion of operators acting separately on the core and on the excited

analytical ansatz to model the dynamical behavior across the various phases

assumption that the wave-function renormalization, that is very severe
especially in the pseudogap phase close to the Mott transition, is perfectly
canceled by the vertex corrections in the Cooper pairing channel.A remarkable
outcome is that a superconducting state can develop even from a pseudogapped
normal state, in which there are no low-energy quasiparticles. The overall
physical scenario that emerges, although unraveled in a specific model and in

particles is developed. It is directly applicable to the magnetosphere of a
pulsar, in which case the particles acquire gyration energies as a result of
resonant absorption of radio emission. In the course of the radio beam
scattering into background the scattered radiation concentrates along the
ambient magnetic field. The scattering from different harmonics of the particle
gyrofrequency takes place at different characteristic altitudes in the
magnetosphere and, because of the rotational effect, gives rise to different
components in the pulse profile. It is demonstrated that the induced scattering
from the first harmonic into the state under the resonance can account for the
so-called low-frequency component in the radio profile of the Crab pulsar. The
precursor component is believed to result from the induced scattering between
the two states well below the resonance. It is shown that these ideas are
strongly supported by the polarization data observed. Based on an analysis of
the fluctuation behaviour of the scattering efficiencies, the transient
components of a similar nature are predicted for other pulsars.

  The Thesis","118 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The lepton flavor violating interactions are worthwhile to examine since they
are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. The simplest extension of
the Standard Model promoting the lepton flavor violating interactions are the
so called two Higgs doublet model which contains an additional Higgs doublet
carrying the same quantum numbers as the first one. In this model, the lepton
flavor violating interactions are induced by new scalar Higgs bosons, scalar
h^{0} and pseudo scalar A^{0}, and Yukawa couplings, appearing as free
parameters, are determined by using the experimental data. On the other hand,
the possible extra dimensions are interesting in the sense that they ensure a
solution to the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems and also result in
the enhancement in the physical quantities of various processes. In the present
work, we predict the branching ratios of lepton flavor violating radion decays
r-> e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}, r-> e^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} and r->\mu^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} in
the two Higgs doublet model, including a single extra dimension, in the

ratios of the processes we study are at most at the order of 10^{-8} for the
small values of radion mass and it decreases with the increasing values of the
radion mass. Among the LFV decays we study, the r->\mu^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} decay
would be the most suitable one to measure its branching ratio.

outlines the stability analysis and a procedure to reduce and simplify the

manifold approach, the multivariable approximants theory, and the alternate
frequency/time domain (AFT) method are applied. Brake vibrations, and more
specifically heavy trucks grabbing are concerned. The modelling introduces
sprag-slip mechanism based on dynamic coupling due to buttressing. The
non-linearity is expressed as a polynomial with quadratic and cubic terms. This
model does not require the use of brake negative coefficient, in order to
predict the instability phenomena. Finally, the center manifold approach, the
multivariable approximants, and the AFT method are used in order to obtain
equations for the limit cycle amplitudes. These methods allow the reduction of
the number of equations of the original system in order to obtain a simplified
system, without loosing the dynamics of the original system, as well as the
contributions of non-linear terms. The goal is the validation of this procedure
for a complex non-linear model by comparing results obtained by solving the

the same star-forming region. This implies a difference in the total binary

difference in the distribution of semi-major axes, or both. (Abridged)

from a homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the Bianchi I type. After
discussing the evolution of the background spacetime, focusing on the number of
e-folds and the isotropization, we solve the perturbation equations and predict
the power spectra of the curvature perturbations and gravity waves at the end
of inflation. The main features of the early anisotropic phase is (1) a
dependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes, (2) a coupling between
curvature perturbations and gravity waves, and (3) the fact that the two
gravity waves polarisations do not share the same spectrum on large scales. All
these effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales
where isotropy is recovered. They depend on a characteristic scale that can,
but a priori must not, be tuned to some observable scale. To fix the initial
conditions, we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in
inflation but that takes into account the fact that the WKB regime is violated
at early times when the shear dominates. We stress that there exist modes that
do not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for
which the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial
conditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study
paves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a
primordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the
importance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates
that when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge
toward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are
less robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of e-folds.

general stratified pseudomanifolds. We review the axiomatic definition of a
smooth stratification $\fS$ of a topological space $X$ and we define a groupoid
$T^{\fS}X$, called the $\fS$-tangent space. This groupoid is made of different
pieces encoding the tangent spaces of the strata, and these pieces are glued
into the smooth noncommutative groupoid $T^{\fS}X$ using the familiar procedure
introduced by A. Connes for the tangent groupoid of a manifold. The main result
is that $C^{*}(T^{\fS}X)$ is Poincar\'e dual to $C(X)$, in other words, the
$\fS$-tangent space plays the role in $K$-theory of a tangent space for $X$.

model, which describes charge transport through a single molecule that is
attached to metal leads. To address vibrationally-coupled electron transport,
we employ a nonequilibrium Green's function approach that extends a method
recently proposed by Galperin et al. [Phys. Rev. B 73, 045314 (2006)] to
multiple vibrational modes. The methodology is applied to two systems: a
generic model with two vibrational degrees of freedom and
benzenedibutanethiolate covalently bound to gold electrodes. The results show
that the coupling to multiple vibrational modes can have a significant effect
on the conductance of a molecular junction. In particular, we demonstrate the
effect of electronically induced coupling between different vibrational modes
and study nonequilibrium vibrational effects by calculating the current-induced
excitation of vibrational modes.

(M_B > -14.0) galaxies along with bright (i.e. L_*) galaxies. Accurate (~ 10%)
distances, I band photometry, and B-V colors are known for the majority of the
galaxies in our sample. The faint galaxies are drawn from the Faint Irregular
Galaxy GMRT survey (FIGGS), and we have HI rotation velocities derived from
aperture synthesis observations for all of them. For the faint galaxies, we
find that even though the median HI and stellar masses are comparable, the HI
mass correlates significantly better with the circular velocity indicators than
the stellar mass. We also find that W$_{20}$ correlates better with mass than
the rotation velocity, although the difference is not statistically
significant. The faint galaxies lie systematically below the I band TF relation
defined by bright galaxies, and also show significantly more intrinsic scatter.
This implies that the integrated star formation in these galaxies has been both
less efficient and also less regulated than in large galaxies. We find that
while the faint end deviation is greatly reduced in Baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF)
relations, the existence of a break at the faint end of the BTF is subject to
systematics such as the assumed stellar mass to light ratio. If we assume that
there is an intrinsic BTF and try to determine the baryonic mass by searching
for prescriptions that lead to the tightest BTF, we find that scaling the HI
mass leads to a much more significant tightening than scaling the stellar mass
to light ratio. The most significant tightening that we find however, is if we
scale the entire baryonic mass of the faint (but not the bright) galaxies. Such
a scenario would be consistent with models where dwarf (but not large) galaxies
have a large fraction of dark or ``missing'' baryons (Slightly abridged)

low-temperature physical properties of a metal. Recent investigations of the
Fermi surface of high-Tc superconductors, however, show a most unusual
behavior: upon addition of carriers, ``Fermi'' pockets appear around nodal
(hole doping) and antinodal (electron doping) regions of the Brillouin zone in
the ``pseudogap'' state. With progressive doping, p, these evolve into
well-defined Fermi surfaces around optimal doping (p_opt), with no pseudogap.
Correspondingly, various physical responses, including d-wave
superconductivity, evolve from highly anomalous, up to p_opt, to more
conventional beyond. Describing this evolution holds the key to understanding
high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we present ab initio quantum chemical
results for cuprates, providing a quantitative description of the evolution of
the Fermi surface with doping. Our results constitute an ab initio
justification for several, hitherto proposed semiphenomenological theories,
offering an unified basis for understanding of various, unusual physical
responses of doped cuprates.
