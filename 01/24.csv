evolved on a set of fixed backgrounds, each provided by a spatial hypersurface
generated numerically during a binary black hole merger. We show that the
scalar field scattered from the merger region exhibits quasinormal ringing once
a common apparent horizon surrounds the two black holes. This occurs earlier
than the onset of the perturbative regime as measured by the start of the
quasinormal ringing in the gravitational waveforms. We also use the scalar
quasinormal frequencies to associate a mass and a spin with each hypersurface,
and observe the compatibility of this measure with the horizon mass and spin
computed from the dynamical horizon framework.

  It is known that over a D-brane the Kalb-Ramond background field of the
string restricts to a 2-bundle with connection (a gerbe) which can be seen as
the obstruction to lifting the PU(H)-bundle on the D-brane to a U(H)-bundle. We
discuss how this phenomenon generalizes from the ordinary central extension
U(1) -> U(H) -> PU(H) to higher categorical central extensions, like the
String-extension BU(1) -> String(G) -> G. Here the obstruction to the lift is a
3-bundle with connection (a 2-gerbe): the Chern-Simons 3-bundle classified by
the first Pontrjagin class. For G = Spin(n) this obstructs the existence of a
String-structure. We discuss how to describe this obstruction problem in terms
of Lie n-algebras and their corresponding categorified Cartan-Ehresmann
connections. Generalizations even beyond String-extensions are then
straightforward. For G = Spin(n) the next step is ""Fivebrane structures"" whose
existence is obstructed by certain generalized Chern-Simons 7-bundles

the searches for Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that
include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The
experimental results encompass the searches for neutral Higgs bosons at LEP1
and LEP2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP2 searches for
charged Higgs bosons and for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into hadrons
independent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with
respect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded
regions of the parameter space in the various scenarios. In the CP-conserving
case, these lead to limits on the masses of the lightest scalar and
pseudoscalar Higgs bosons, h and A, and on tan(beta). The dependence of these
limits on the top quark mass is discussed. Allowing for CP violation reduces
the experimental sensitivity to Higgs bosons. It is shown that this effect
depends strongly on the values of the parameters responsible for CP violation
in the Higgs sector.

thermodynamic properties of the clean interacting wire, which can be in one of
two phases: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and charge density wave phases. When the
wire is disordered, we investigate the Friedel oscillations, exploring the
difference between the two phases and comparing them to the clean
non-interacting case, for which we develop an exact formula for the

method, the particle-hole DMRG (PH-DMRG), which is used to calculate the GS
energy of a disordered QD consisting of interacting spinless electrons. We show
that this method is much more accurate than the Hartree-Fock method, and we
suggest an improvement of the algorithm, which reduces the error rate by almost
30 percents. Finally we study the magnetization of a QD with spin 1/2
electrons, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and interactions. We
calculate the g-factor and the expectation values of the spin operators in the
GS, and find that when the QD is occupied by an even number of electrons, the

model results. The critical properties of physical observables, such as the
baryon number susceptibility and the specific heat, are analyzed in the
vicinity of the critical end point, with special focus on their critical
exponents. The results with the PNJL model are closer to lattice results and we
also recover the universal behavior of the critical exponents of both the
baryon susceptibility and the specific heat.

envelopes, and they could be an important mechanism for transporting angular
momentum in the radiative interiors of stars. Prior work has established that
they could operate over a short enough time scale to explain the internal solar
rotation as a function of depth. We demonstrate that the natural action of IGWs
is to produce large scale oscillations in the solar rotation as a function of
depth, which is in marked contrast to the nearly uniform rotation in the outer
radiative envelope of the Sun. An additional angular momentum transport
mechanism is therefore required, and neither molecular nor shear-induced
turbulent viscosity is sufficient to smooth out the profile. Magnetic
processes, such as the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, could flatten the rotation
profile. We therefore conclude that IGWs must operate in conjunction with
magnetic angular momentum transport processes if they operate at all.
Furthermore, both classes of mechanisms must be inhibited to some degree by
mean molecular weight gradients in order to explain the recent evidence for a
rapidly rotating embedded core in the Sun.

and the related equation of state is expressed using the virial theorem for

Shallower density profiles are found to yield an equation of state,
\phi=\phi(y,m), characterized (for assigned values of the fractional mass,
m=M_j/ M_i) by the occurrence of two extremum points, a minimum and a maximum.
Steeper density profiles produce a similar equation of state, which implies
that a special value of m is related to a critical curve where the above
mentioned extremum points reduce to a single horizontal inflexion point, and
curves below the critical one show no extremum points. The similarity of the
isofractional mass curves to van der Waals' isothermal curves, suggests the
possibility of a phase transition in a bell-shaped region of the (O y \phi)
plane, where the fractional truncation radius along a selected direction is
y=R_j/R_i, and the fractional virial potential energy is
\phi=(E_{ji})_{vir}/(E_{ij})_{vir}. Further investigation is devoted to mass
distributions described by Hernquist (1990) density profiles, for which an
additional relation can be used to represent a sample of N=16 elliptical
galaxies (EGs) on the (O y \phi) plane, under the assumption that the
fractional mass related to EGs and their hosting dark matter (DM) haloes, has a
universal value. In the light of the model, the evolution of isolated EGs
appears to be other than strictly homologous, due to different values of

the EXACT relativistic equations of motion, for a given metric (corresponding
to a gravitational field at first post-Newtonian order or higher), instead of
Newtonian equations plus relativistic corrections. The aim of the present paper
is to validate the method, and to illustrate how RMI can be used for space
missions to produce relativistic ephemerides of test-bodies (or satellites).
Indeed, nowadays, relativistic effects have to be taken into account, and
comparing a RMI model with a classical keplerian one helps to quantify such
effects.
  LISA is a relevant example to use RMI. A precise orbit model for the LISA
spacecraft is needed not only for the sake of satellite ephemerides but also to
compute the photon flight time in laser links between spacecraft, required in
LISA data pre-processing in order to reach the gravitational wave detection
level.
  Relativistic effects in LISA orbit model needed to be considered and
quantified. Using RMI, we show that the numerical classical model for LISA
orbits in the gravitational field of a non-rotating spherical Sun without
planets can be wrong, with respect to the numerical relativisitic version of
the same model, by as much as about ten kilometers in radial distance during a
year and up to about 60 kilometers in along track distance after a year... with
consequences on estimated photon flight times.
  We validated RMI numerical results with a 1PN analytical developpement.

We are not able to confirm the reported 10.9 hr orbital period from 1982,partly
because our sampling is not ideal for this purpose and also, we suspect,
because our radial velocities are distorted by line profile changes due to an
erratic wind. P-Cygni profiles are found in several of the emission lines,
including those of C IV. Carbon lines are abundant in the spectra, suggesting a
carbon enrichment in the doner star. The presence of [O III] 5007\AA and [N II]
6584\AA is likely due to a diffuse nebula in the vicinity of the system.
  The wind signatures in the spectra and the presence of nebular lines are in
agreement with the accretion wind evolution scenario that has been suggested to
lead to SNeIa. We argue that QU Car is a member of the V Sge subclass of CVs,
and a possible SNeIa progenitor. It is shown that the recent light curve of QU
Car has ~1 mag low states, similar to the light curve of V Sge, strengthening
the connection of QU Car with V Sge stars, supersoft x-ray sources, and SNeIa

satellites of the recently discovered cataclysmic variable
1RXSJ173021.5-055933, together with simultaneous UV and coordinated optical
photometry aiming at characterising its broad-band temporal and spectral
properties and classifying this system as a magnetic one. We find that the
X-ray light curve is dominated by the 128s spin period of the accreting white
dwarf in contrast to the far-UV range, which turns out to be unmodulated at a
3sigma level. Near-UV and optical pulses are instead detected at twice the spin
frequency. We identify the contributions from two accreting poles that imply a
moderately inclined dipole field allowing, one pole to dominate at energies at
least up to 10keV, and a secondary that instead is negligible above 5keV. X-ray
spectral analysis reveals the presence of multiple emission components
consisting of optically thin plasma with temperatures ranging from 0.17keV to
60keV and a hot blackbody at ~90eV. The spectrum is also strongly affected by
peculiar absorption components consisting of two high-density
(~3x10^(21)cm^(-2) and ~2x10^(23)cm^(-2)) intervening columns, plus a warm
absorber. The last is detected from an OVII absorption edge at 0.74keV, which
suggests that photoionization of pre-shock material is also occurring in this
system. The observed properties indicate that the accretor in
1RXSJ173021.5-055933 is a white dwarf with a likely weak magnetic field, thus
confirming this cataclysmic variable as an intermediate polar (IP) with one of
the most extreme spin-to-orbit period ratios. This system also joins the small
group of IPs showing a soft X-ray reprocessed component, suggesting that this
characteristics is not uncommon in these systems.

disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of ~500
km/s across 0.2 arcsec (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star
forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence
that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived 'maximum' star forming events in
highly dissipative mergers of gas rich galaxies. The resulting high mass
surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent
galaxies in the same redshift range, and much higher than those in local
spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and
quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the
comparison of gas exhaustion time scales and stellar ages, we estimate that the
SMG phase duration is about 100 Myrs. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV
selected high redshift star forming galaxies supports a 'universal' Chabrier
IMF as being valid over the star forming history of these galaxies. We find
that the 12CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z~2-3 are
probably similar to those assumed at z~0. The implied gas fractions in our
sample galaxies range from 20 to 50%.

understanding cortical development, yet its applicability remains unconfirmed.
Models for the self-organization of neural circuits have been proposed, but
experimentally testable predictions of these models have been less clear. The
visual cortex contains a large number of topological point defects, called
pinwheels, which are detectable in experiments and therefore in principle well
suited for testing predictions of self-organization empirically. Here, we
analytically calculate the density of pinwheels predicted by a pattern
formation model of visual cortical development. An important factor controlling
the density of pinwheels in this model appears to be the presence of non-local
long-range interactions, a property which distinguishes cortical circuits from
many nonliving systems in which self-organization has been studied. We show
that in the limit where the range of these interactions is infinite, the
average pinwheel density converges to $\pi$. Moreover, an average pinwheel
density close to this value is robustly selected even for intermediate
interaction ranges, a regime arguably covering interaction-ranges in a wide
range of different species. In conclusion, our paper provides the first direct
theoretical demonstration and analysis of pinwheel density selection in models
of cortical self-organization and suggests to quantitatively probe this type of
prediction in future high-precision experiments.

only be achievable photometrically with future projects such as the Large

uniform luminosities and more accurate photometric redshifts than galaxies, but
the disadvantage is that they are transitory and hard to obtain in large number

0.8 is able to measure the baryon signature in the SN spatial power spectrum.
Although dark energy constraints from SN BAOs are weak, they can significantly
improve the results from SN luminosity distances of the same data, and the

phase, the nematic degree of freedom tends to order and form a helix. Due to
the nemato-elastic coupling, this also leads to elastic deformation of the
polymer network that is locally coaxial with the nematic order. However, the
helical structure of nematic order is incompatible with the energetically
preferred elastic deformation. The system is therefore frustrated and
appropriate compromise has to be achieved between the nematic ordering and the
elastic deformation. For a strongly chiral elastomer whose pitch is much
smaller than the system size, this problem has been studied by Pelcotivs and
Meyer, as well as by Warner. In this work, we study the isotropic-cholesteric
transition in the weak chirality limit, where the pitch is comparable or much
larger than system size. We compare two possible solutions: a helical state as
well as a double twist state. We find that the double twist state very
efficiently minimizes both the elastic free energy and the chiral nematic free
energy. On the other hand, the pitch of the helical state is strongly affected
by the nemato-elastic coupling. As a result this state is not efficient in
minimizing the chiral nematic free energy.

part dependent of the chosen model (i.e. leptonic rather than adronic). The
indication is that, in almost all cases, the carried Poynting flux is not
dominant, while protons should carry most of the power. In emission line
blazars the jet has a comparable, and often larger, power than the luminosity
of the accretion disk. This is even more true for line-less BL Lacs. If the jet
is structured at the sub-pc scale, with a fast spine surrounded by a slower
layer, then one component sees the radiation of the other boosted, and this
interplay enhances the Inverse Compton flux of both. Since the layer emission
is less beamed, it can be seen also at large viewing angles, making
radio-galaxies very interesting GLAST candidates. Such structures need not be
stable components, and can form and disappear rapidly. Ultrafast TeV
variability is challenging all existing models, suggesting that at least parts
of the jets are moving with large bulk Lorentz factors and at extremely small

approximation to an underlying non-local reality involving fundamental entities

dominated by a vacuum energy/cosmological constant. The holographic principle
then indicates only a finite number of bits of information will ever be
available to describe the observable universe, and that requires a holographic
preon model linking the (0,1) holographic bits to SM particles. All SM

wrapped states of the strands. SM particles in this wrapped preon model can be
approximated by preon bound states in non-local dynamics based on three-preon

technologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and
providers of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading
to microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and
computer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of
different technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the
spreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of
the system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced
technologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.
We show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with

occurrences has an obviously relevant practical application: for example,
patterns that are significantly over- or under-represented in the genome are
interesting candidates for biological roles. However, the problem is
computationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use
fast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have
been shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact
approaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the
case of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based
on deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not
only the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability
distribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the
time complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better
than that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known
to date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions:
DFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so
far they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous
works do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used
respectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI),
or to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA
to perform the calculations. This innovative approach can realistically be used
for exact statistical studies of very long genomes and protein sequences, as we
illustrate with some examples on the scale of the human genome.

anisotropic models which avoid this bound completely. Within these bounds, the
anisotropy can be beneficial as a potential explanation of various anomalous
cosmological observations, especially in the CMB at the largest angles. We also
consider the dynamics of linear perturbations in these models. The covariant
approach is used to derive the general evolution equations for cosmological

oracle achieves black-box security at most $2^{(1+o(1))q}$, where $q$ is the
total number of oracle queries asked by the key generation, signing, and
verification algorithms. That is, any such scheme can be broken with
probability close to $1$ by a (computationally unbounded) adversary making
$2^{(1+o(1))q}$ queries to the oracle. This is tight up to a constant factor in
the number of queries, since a simple modification of Lamport's one-time
signatures (Lamport '79) achieves $2^{(0.812-o(1))q}$ black-box security using
$q$ queries to the oracle.
  Our result extends (with a loss of a constant factor in the number of
queries) also to the random permutation and ideal-cipher oracles. Since the
symmetric primitives (e.g. block ciphers, hash functions, and message
authentication codes) can be constructed by a constant number of queries to the
mentioned oracles, as corollary we get lower bounds on the efficiency of
signature schemes from symmetric primitives when the construction is black-box.
This can be taken as evidence of an inherent efficiency gap between signature

instability supernovae (PISN) in halos from 6.9 $\times$ 10$^5$ - 1.2 $\times$
10$^7$ $\Ms$, those in which Population III stars are expected to form via
H$_2$ cooling. The supernovae evolve along two evolutionary paths according to
whether they explode in \ion{H}{2} regions or neutral halos. Those in
\ion{H}{2} regions first expand adiabatically and then radiate strongly upon
collision with baryons ejected from the halo during its photoevaporation by the
progenitor. Explosions in neutral halos promptly emit most of their kinetic
energy as x-rays, but retain enough momentum to seriously disrupt the halo. We
find that the least energetic of the supernovae are capable of destroying halos
$\lesssim$ 10$^7$ $\Ms$, while a single PISN can destroy even more massive
halos. Blasts in \ion{H}{2} regions disperse heavy elements into the IGM, but
neutral halos confine the explosion and its metals. In \ion{H}{2} regions, a
prompt second generation of stars may form in the remnant at radii of 100 - 200
pc in the halo. Explosions confined by large halos instead recollapse, with
infall rates in excess of 10$^{-2}$ $\Ms$ yr$^{-1}$ that heavily contaminate
their interior. This fallback may either fuel massive black hole growth at very
high redshifts or create the first globular cluster with a radius of 10 - 20 pc
at the center of the halo. Our findings allow the possibility that the first
primitive galaxies formed sooner, with greater numbers of stars and distinct
chemical abundance patterns, than in current models.

polarization in U(1) case by substituting it into the primary Yang-Mills

transversal condition for free vector boson, it is found that in the Lagrangian
the scalar field for the Higgs mechanism can automatically arise after we
separate a part equivalent to the contribution of a massless boson. In
addition, a criterion is obtained to infer whether the boson is massive or not:
if $\mathbf{E}^2-\mathbf{B}^2\neq 0$, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are

hydrodynamics. In order to achieve this, we first develop a Weyl-covariant
formalism which simplifies the study of conformal hydrodynamics. This naturally
leads us to a proposal for the entropy current of an arbitrary conformal fluid

definite expression for the entropy flux in the case of N=4 SYM fluid. We
conclude this note by comparing the formalism presented here with the

multiplexing, and delay in MIMO systems to minimize end-to-end distortion. We
first focus on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO systems, and develop
analytical results to minimize distortion of a vector quantizer concatenated
with a space-time MIMO channel code. In the high SNR regime we obtain a
closed-form expression for the end-to-end distortion as a function of the
optimal point on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curve. For large but
finite SNR we find this optimal point via convex optimization. We then consider
MIMO systems using ARQ retransmission to provide additional diversity at the
expense of delay. For sources without a delay constraint, distortion is
minimized by maximizing the ARQ window size. This results in an ARQ-enhanced
multiplexing-diversity tradeoff region, with distortion minimized over this
region in the same manner as without ARQ. Under a source delay constraint the
problem formulation changes to account for delay distortion associated with
random message arrival and random ARQ completion times. We use a dynamic
programming formulation to capture the channel diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
at finite SNR as well as the random arrival and retransmission dynamics; we
solve for the optimal multiplexing-diversity-delay tradeoff to minimize
end-to-end distortion associated with the source encoder, channel, and ARQ
retransmissions. Our results show that a delay-sensitive system should adapt
its operating point on the diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff region to the
system dynamics. We provide numerical results that demonstrate significant
performance gains of this adaptive policy over a static allocation of
diversity/multiplexing in the channel code and a static ARQ window size.

to maintain connectivity in these networks, even in the presence of repeated

present a new algorithm, DASH, that provably ensures that: 1) the network stays
connected even if an adversary deletes up to all nodes in the network; and 2)
no node ever increases its degree by more than 2 log n, where n is the number
of nodes initially in the network. DASH is fully distributed; adds new edges
only among neighbors of deleted nodes; and has average latency and bandwidth
costs that are at most logarithmic in n. DASH has these properties irrespective
of the topology of the initial network, and is thus orthogonal and
complementary to traditional topology-based approaches to defending against
attack.
  We also prove lower-bounds showing that DASH is asymptotically optimal in
terms of minimizing maximum degree increase over multiple attacks. Finally, we
present empirical results on power-law graphs that show that DASH performs well
in practice, and that it significantly outperforms naive algorithms in reducing
maximum degree increase. We also present empirical results on performance of
our algorithms and a new heuristic with regard to stretch (increase in shortest
path lengths).

main ring, while some systems exhibit smooth surface brightness profiles (SB)
that fall off roughly as r**-3.5, others display large luminosity drops at the
ring's outer edge and steeper radial SB profiles. We seek to understand this
diversity of outer edge profiles under the ``natural'' collisional evolution of
the system, without invoking external agents such as planets or gas. We use a
statistical code to follow the evolution of a collisional population, ranging
from dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and
initially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically
evolves toward a ""standard"" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \propto
r**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the
form of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two
parameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that
it becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the
required disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the
dynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (<e> <0.01)
that the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are
preferentially depleted. This low-excitation case, although possibly not
generic, cannot be ruled out by observations. Our ""standard"" profile provides a
satisfactory explanation for a large group of debris discs with outer edges and
SB falling as r**-3.5. Systems with sharper outer edges, barring other
confining agents, could still be explained by ``natural'' collisional evolution
if their dynamical excitation is very low. We show that such a dynamically-cold
case provides a satisfactory fit for HR4796A

distinct advantages, because they are able to modify the surface properties of

plasma treatments require the development of reliable and large systems. Such
systems are now existing and the use of plasma physics in industrial problems
is rapidly increasing. On textile surfaces, three main effects can be obtained
depending on the treatment conditions: the cleaning effect, the increase of
microroughness (anti-pilling finishing of wool) and the production of radicals
to obtain hydrophilic surfaces. Plasma polymerisation, that is the deposition
of solid polymeric materials with desired properties on textile substrates, is
under development. The advantage of such plasma treatments is that the
modification turns out to be restricted in the uppermost layers of the
substrate, thus not affecting the overall desirable bulk properties. Here, we
present the research results on the use of plasma physics in textile properties
modification. Treatments on natural, wool and cotton, and on synthetic polymers

periods. We study the attenuation of non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in a
slab prominence embedded in the coronal medium. We assume an equilibrium
configuration with a transverse magnetic field to the slab axis and investigate
wave damping by thermal conduction and radiative losses. The differential MHD
equations that govern linear slow and fast modes are numerically solved to
obtain the complex oscillatory frequency and the corresponding eigenfunctions.
We find that coronal thermal conduction and radiative losses from the
prominence plasma reveal as the most relevant damping mechanisms. Both
mechanisms govern together the attenuation of hybrid modes, whereas prominence
radiation is responsible for the damping of internal modes and coronal
conduction essentially dominates the attenuation of external modes. In
addition, the energy transfer between the prominence and the corona caused by
thermal conduction has a noticeable effect on the wave stability, radiative
losses from the prominence plasma being of paramount importance for the thermal
stability of fast modes. We conclude that slow modes are efficiently damped,
with damping times compatible with observations. On the contrary, fast modes
are less attenuated by non-adiabatic effects and their damping times are
several orders of magnitude larger than those observed. The presence of the
corona causes a decrease of the damping times with respect to those of an
isolated prominence slab, but its effect is still insufficient to obtain
damping times of the order of the period in the case of fast modes.

is shown that equations for these fields can be considered as relations
describing the space topological defects. These defects, being closed
topological manifolds, are embedded in the outer five-dimensional space, and
observable objects appear to be intersections of above defects with the
physical space. This interpretation explains irrational properties of quantum
objects such as wave-corpuscular duality, stochastic behavior, instantaneous
nonlocal correlation in EPR-paradox, the light velocity invariance and so on.
Wave-corpuscular properties arise as a result of the defect periodical movement
in the outer space relative to its intersection with the physical space, and
just this periodical movement attributes phase to the propagating object.
Appearance of probabilities within the formalism is a consequence of
uncertainty of the closed topological manifold shape, and ensemble of all
possible shapes for the same object can be considered as an ensemble of hidden
variables that leads to probabilistic description. Embedded in the outer space
topological defects provide channels for nonlocal correlations between their
intersections-- noninteracting particles in EPR-experiments, and this means
that the proposed approach can be considered as a nonlocal model with hidden
variables.

accuracy in repeated sampling. The derivation of the $p$-values, however,
asserts a stronger statement, that they have a uniform(0, 1) distribution
conditionally, given identified precision information provided by the data. We
take a simple regression example that involves exact precision information and
use large sample techniques to extract highly accurate information as to the
statistical position of the data point with respect to the parameter:
specifically, we examine various $p$-values and Bayesian posterior survivor
$s$-values for validity. With observed data we numerically evaluate the various
$p$-values and $s$-values, and we also record the related general formulas. We
then assess the numerical values for accuracy using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(McMC) methods. We also propose some third-order likelihood-based procedures
for obtaining means and variances of Bayesian posterior distributions, again
followed by McMC assessment. Finally we propose some adaptive McMC methods to
improve the simulation acceptance rates. All these methods are based on
asymptotic analysis that derives from the effect of additional data. And the
methods use simple calculations based on familiar maximizing values and related
informations. The example illustrates the general formulas and the ease of
calculations, while the McMC assessments demonstrate the numerical validity of
the $p$-values as percentage position of a data point. The example, however, is
very simple and transparent, and thus gives little indication that in a wide

phenomenology we find an extremely short (~2 sec) soft X-ray peak, which is
very likely of thermal, rather than non-thermal nature and temporally coincides
with the optical flare peak. While at hard X-ray energies non-thermal bursts
are routinely observed on the Sun at flare onset, thermal soft X-ray bursts on

Time-dependent, one-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of this event requires an

produces a total magnification greater than unity. This theorem seems to
contradict the conservation of total flux from a lensed source. The standard
solution to this paradox is based on the exact definition of the reference
'unlensed' situation.
  We calculate magnifications and amplifications for general lensing scenarios
not limited to regions close to the optical axis. In this way the formalism is
naturally extended from tangential planes for the source and lensed images to
complete spheres. We derive the lensing potential theory on the sphere and find
that the Poisson equation is modified by an additional source term that is
related to the mean density and to the Newtonian potential at the positions of
observer and source. This new term generally reduces the magnification, to
below unity far from the optical axis, and ensures conservation of the total
photon number received on a sphere around the source.
  This discussion does not affect the validity of the 'focusing theorem', in
which the unlensed situation is defined to have an unchanged affine distance
between source and observer. The focusing theorem does not contradict flux
conservation, because the mean total magnification directly corresponds to
different areas of the source sphere in the lensed and unlensed situation. We
argue that a constant affine distance does not define an astronomically
meaningful reference.
  By exchanging source and observer, we confirm that magnification and
amplification differ according to Etherington's reciprocity law, so that
surface brightness is no longer strictly conserved. [ abridged ]

on the question where the newly formed stars are located. The stripping radius
from the simulation is compared to analytical estimates. Disc galaxies are
modelled in combined N-body/hydrodynamic simulations (GADGET-2) with
prescriptions for cooling, star formation, stellar feedback, and galactic
winds. These model galaxies move through a constant density and temperature
gas, which has parameters comparable to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) in the
outskirts of a galaxy cluster (T=3 keV ~3.6x10^7 K and rho=10^-28 g/cm^3). With
this numerical setup we analyse the influence of ram-pressure stripping on the
star formation rate of the model galaxy. We find that the star formation rate
is significantly enhanced by the ram-pressure effect (up to a factor of 3).
Stars form in the compressed central region of the galaxy as well as in the
stripped gas behind the galaxy. Newly formed stars can be found up to hundred
kpc behind the disc, forming structures with sizes of roughly 1 kpc in diameter
and with masses of up to 10^7 M_sun. As they do not possess a dark matter halo
due to their formation history, we name them 'stripped baryonic dwarf'
galaxies. We also find that the analytical estimate for the stripping radius
from a Gunn & Gott (1972) criterion is in good agreement with the numerical
value from the simulation. Like in former investigations, edge-on systems lose
less gas than face-on systems and the resulting spatial distribution of the gas
and the newly formed stars is different.

finite group $G$ over a discrete valuation ring $S$ is a maximal order, was
answered in the 1960's for the case where $S$ is tamely ramified over the
subring of invariants $S^G$. The answer was given in terms of the conductor
subgroup (with respect to $f$) of the inertia. In this paper we solve this
problem in general when $S/S^G$ is residually separable. We show that the
maximal order property entails a restrictive structure on the sub-crossed
product graded by the inertia subgroup. In particular, the inertia is abelian.
Using this structure, one is able to extend the notion of the conductor. As in
the tame case, the order of the conductor is equal to the number of maximal two
sided ideals of $T$ and hence to the number of maximal orders containing $T$ in
its quotient ring. Consequently, $T$ is a maximal order if and only if the
conductor subgroup is trivial.

(a) most massive stars are born in multiple systems (b) most IMFs are derived

superpositions between members are expected to happen if the cluster is too
distant. In this article I use numerical experiments to model the consequences
of those phenomena on the observed color-magnitude diagrams and the IMFs
derived from them. Real multiple systems affect the observed or apparent
massive-star MF slope little but can create a significant population of
apparently ultramassive stars. Chance superpositions produce only small biases
when the number of superimposed stars is low but, once a certain number
threshold is reached, they can affect both the observed slope and the apparent
stellar upper mass limit. I apply those experiments to two well known massive
young clusters in the Local Group, NGC 3603 and R136. In both cases I show that
the observed population of stars with masses above 120 solar masses can be
explained by the effects of unresolved objects, mostly real multiple systems
for NGC 3603 and a combination of real and chance-alignment multiple systems
for R136. Therefore, the case for the reality of a stellar upper mass limit at
solar or near-solar metallicities is strengthened, with a possible value even
lower than 150 solar masses. An IMF slope somewhat flatter than Salpeter or
Kroupa with gamma between -1.6 and -2.0 is derived for the central region of
NGC 3603, with a significant contribution to the uncertainty arising from the
imprecise knowledge of the distance to the cluster. The IMF at the very center
of R136 cannot be measured with the currently available data but the situation
could change with new HST observations. (abridged)

orbits of graphs under the generalized local complementation operation
correspond to equivalence classes of codes. We have previously used this fact
to classify self-dual additive codes over GF(4). In this paper we classify
self-dual additive codes over GF(9), GF(16), and GF(25). Assuming that the
classical MDS conjecture holds, we are able to classify all self-dual additive
MDS codes over GF(9) by using an extension technique. We prove that the minimum
distance of a self-dual additive code is related to the minimum vertex degree
in the associated graph orbit. Circulant graph codes are introduced, and a
computer search reveals that this set contains many strong codes. We show that
some of these codes have highly regular graph representations.

beams on a flexible, circular fixed ring, using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.
The model displayed has been fully developed within the rotating frame by use
of an energy approach. The beams considered possess two degrees of freedom
(dofs), a flexural motion as well as a traction/compression motion. In-plane
deformations of the ring will be considered. Divergences and mode couplings
have thus been underscored within the rotating frame and in order to simplify
understanding of all these phenomena, the dofs of the beams will first be
treated separately and then together. The dynamics of radial rotating loads on
an elastic ring can create divergence instabilities as well as post-critical
mode couplings. Moreover, the flexural motion of beam rubbing on the ring can
also lead to mode couplings and to the locus-veering phenomenon. The presence
of rubbing seems to make the system unstable as soon as the rotational speed of
the beams is greater than zero. Lastly, the influence of an angle between the
beams and the normal to the ring's inner surface will be studied with respect
to system stability, thus highlighting a shift frequency phenomenon.
