analysis of Wilson loops we verified the $\frac{1}{R}$ behavior, in the layered
phase, for the potential between heavy charges. The renormalized fine structure
constant in the layer phase is found to be equal to that of 4D Coulomb
phase,$\alpha_{layer}$=$\alpha_{4D}$. ii) Based on the helicity modulus
analysis we show that the layers are in the Coulomb phase while the transverse
bulk space is in the confining phase. We also calculated the renormalized
coupling $\beta_{R}$ and found results compatible with those obtained from the
Coulomb potential. Finally we calculated the potential in the 5D Coulomb phase
and found $\frac{1}{R^{2}}$ behavior for the static $q \bar{q}$ potential. From
the study of the helicity modulus we have a possible estimate for the five

We find that while thermal melting of COO in La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 is quite
similar to that in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3, the field-induced transition from the COO

abrupt, and occurs at significantly lower fields (H~2 T at T~0 K) than in

existence problem for boolean dynamical systems, i.e., finite discrete
dynamical systems over the domain {0, 1}, is presented. For function classes F
and graph classes G, an (F, G)-system is a boolean dynamical system such that
all local transition functions lie in F and the underlying graph lies in G. Let
F be a class of boolean functions which is closed under composition and let G
be a class of graphs which is closed under taking minors. The following
dichotomy theorems are shown: (1) If F contains the self-dual functions and G
contains the planar graphs then the fixed-point existence problem for (F,
G)-systems with local transition function given by truth-tables is NP-complete;
otherwise, it is decidable in polynomial time. (2) If F contains the self-dual

compute cross sections for the special case of radiation incident along the
rotation axis. A catalogue of numerically-accurate cross sections is presented,
for a range of incident wavelengths $M\omega \le 4$ and rotation rates $a \le
0.999M$. Three effects are studied in detail: polarization, helicity-reversal
and glory scattering. First, a new approximation to the polarization in the
long-wavelength limit is derived. We show that black hole rotation
distinguishes between co- and counter-rotating wave helicities, leading to a
term in the cross section proportional to $a\omega$. Second, we confirm that
helicity is not conserved by the scattering process, and show that
superradiance amplifies the effect. For certain wavelengths, the back-scattered
flux is enhanced by as much as $\sim 35$ times for a rapidly-rotating hole
(e.g. for $a = 0.999M$ at $M\omega = 0.945$). Third, we observe regular glory

the present definition of the Astronomical Unit (AU) based on the fixed
Gaussian gravity constant kGS = 0.01720209895 (AU)^1.5/day, the value AUmet of
the AU in meters must decrease at 1/3 this rate, all these rates being
expressed logarithmically. The progress of the planets along their orbits slows
quadratically with time. For example, in one century Mercury would lag behind
the position predicted using constant solar mass by almost 1.4 km, in two

the solar Gaussian gravity constant kGS used in defining the AU could be

allows production of semiclassical black holes in particle collisions at the

gravity in the bulk can be higher than on the brane where we live. A well-known
example of this situation is the case of warped extra dimensions. Even if the
energy of the collision is not sufficient to create a black hole on the brane,
it may be enough to produce a particle which accelerates into the bulk up to
trans-Planckian energy and creates a large black hole there. In a concrete
model we consider, the black hole is formed in a collision of the particle with
its own image at an orbifold plane. When the particle in question carries some
Standard Model gauge charges the created black hole gets attached to our brane
by a string of the gauge flux. For a 4-dimensional observer such system looks
as a long-lived charged state with the mass continuously decreasing due to
Hawking evaporation of the black hole. This provides a distinctive signature of
black hole formation in our scenario.

consider a scheme in which a current in a hollow wire produces a large vector

the electron mass shift by orders of magnitude over its room temperature value.

of accretion processes, the mid-IR crucially detects jet synchrotron emission
from NSs that is virtually immeasurable at other wavelengths. A further benefit
of Spitzer observations is that mid-infrared wavelengths can easily penetrate
regions that are heavily obscured. Many X-ray binaries lie in the Galactic
plane and as such are often heavily obscured in the optical by interstellar
extinction. The infrared component of the SED, vital to the study of jets and
dust, can be provided {\it only} by Spitzer; in the X-rays we currently have an
unprecedented six satellites available and in the optical and radio dozens of

According to the
hadrogenesis conjecture the nature of the two types of states is distinct. The
axial-vector mesons are generated dynamically by coupled-channel interactions
based on the chiral Lagrangian written down in terms of the Goldstone bosons
and the light vector mesons. We propose a novel counting scheme that arises if
the chiral Lagrangian is supplemented by constraints from large-N_c QCD in the
context of the hadrogenesis conjecture. The counting scheme is successfully
tested by a systematic study of the properties of vector mesons. The spectrum
of light axial-vector mesons is derived relying on the leading order
interaction of the Goldstone bosons with the vector mesons supplemented by a
phenomenology for correction terms. The f_1(1282), b_1(1230), h_1(1386),
a_1(1230) and K_1(1272) mesons are recovered as molecular states. Based on
those results the one-loop contributions to the electromagnetic decay
amplitudes of axial-vector molecules into pseudo-scalar or vector mesons are
evaluated systematically. In order to arrive at gauge invariant results in a
transparent manner we choose to represent the vector particles by
anti-symmetric tensor fields. It is emphasized that there are no tree-level
contributions to a radiative decay amplitude of a given state if that state is
generated by coupled-channel dynamics. The inclusion of the latter would be
double counting. At present we restrict ourselves to loops where a vector and a
pseudo-scalar meson couple to the axial-vector molecule. We argue that final
and predictive results require further computations involving intermediate
states with two vector mesons. The relevance of the latter is predicted by our
counting rules.

distribution N(z) of galaxy photometric samples from photometric observables.
The method does not rely on photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for
individual galaxies, which typically suffer from biases. Instead, it assigns
weights to galaxies in a spectroscopic subsample such that the weighted
distributions of photometric observables (e.g., multi-band magnitudes) match
the corresponding distributions for the photometric sample. The weights are
estimated using a nearest-neighbor technique that ensures stability in sparsely
populated regions of color-magnitude space. The derived weights are then summed
in redshift bins to create the redshift distribution. We apply this weighting
technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as to mock catalogs
for the Dark Energy Survey, and compare the results to those from the
estimation of photo-z's derived by a neural network algorithm. We find that the
weighting method accurately recovers the underlying redshift distribution,
typically better than the photo-z reconstruction, provided the spectroscopic
subsample spans the range of photometric observables covered by the photometric
sample.

the convergence of chiral perturbation theory applicable to QCD. Here we
demonstrate that a strongly coupled lattice gauge theory model with the same
symmetries as two-flavor QCD but with a much lighter $\sigma$-resonance is
different. Our model allows us to study efficiently the convergence of chiral
perturbation theory as a function of $\xi$. We first confirm that the leading
low energy constants appearing in the chiral Lagrangian are the same when
calculated from the $p$-regime and the $\epsilon$-regime as expected. However,
$\xi \lesssim 0.002$ is necessary before 1-loop chiral perturbation theory
predicts the data within 1%. For $\xi > 0.0035$ the data begin to deviate
dramatically from 1-loop chiral perturbation theory predictions. We argue that
this qualitative change is due to the presence of a light $\sigma$-resonance in
our model. Our findings may be useful for lattice QCD studies.

now spatially resolved and is dominated by galaxies in the redshift range
between 0.5 and 1.5. We find no signature than can be attributed to high
redshift sources after subtraction of all known sources either in the residual
background or in the fluctuations of the residual background. We show that the
color of the fluctuations from both NICMOS and Spitzer observations are
consistent with low redshift objects and inconsistent with objects at redshifts
greater than 10. It is most likely that the residual fluctuation power after
source subtraction is due to the outer regions of low redshift galaxies that

increases by as much as 2 dex. As long as the branching ratio for S^+2 + H2 ->
SH+ + H+ exceeds a few percent, doubly ionized chemistry will be the dominant
pathway to SH+, which then initiates the formation of other sulfur-bearing

S^+2 once H2 forms, while the S^+2 abundance remains high in the atomic
hydrogen region. We discuss the possible consequences of S^+2 in the atomic

The colluders and the fingerprint embedder are subject to signal fidelity

formulations of fingerprinting. The fundamental tradeoffs between fingerprint
codelength, number of users, number of colluders, fidelity constraints, and
decoding reliability are then determined. Several bounds on fingerprinting
capacity have been presented in recent literature. This paper derives exact
capacity formulas and presents a new randomized fingerprinting scheme with the
following properties: (1) the encoder and receiver assume a nominal coalition
size but do not need to know the actual coalition size and the collusion
channel; (2) a tunable parameter $\Delta$ trades off false-positive and
false-negative error exponents; (3) the receiver provides a reliability metric
for its decision; and (4) the scheme is capacity-achieving when the
false-positive exponent $\Delta$ tends to zero and the nominal coalition size
coincides with the actual coalition size.
  A fundamental component of the new scheme is the use of a ""time-sharing""
randomized sequence. The decoder is a maximum penalized mutual information
decoder, where the significance of each candidate coalition is assessed
relative to a threshold, and the penalty is proportional to the coalition size.
A much simpler {\em threshold decoder} that satisfies properties (1)---(3)

generalizing the usual theory of principal bundles. It is well-known that under
mild conditions on a topological group G and a space M, principal G-bundles
over M are classified by either the first Cech cohomology of M with
coefficients in G, or the set of homotopy classes [M,BG], where BG is the
classifying space of G. Here we review work by Bartels, Jurco,
Baas-Bokstedt-Kro, and others generalizing this result to topological 2-groups
and even topological 2-categories. We explain various viewpoints on topological
2-groups and Cech cohomology with coefficients in a topological 2-group C, also

mild conditions on M and C there is a bijection between the first Cech
cohomology of M with coefficients in C and [M,B|C|] where B|C| is the
classifying space of the geometric realization of the nerve of C. Applying this
result to the 'string 2-group' String(G) of a simply-connected compact simple

characteristic classes coming from elements of the rational cohomology of BG

due to the temperature dependence of the bath spectral profile. The decoherence

self-gravitating accretion discs. Accretion discs are a fundamental component
of several astrophysical systems on very diverse scales, and can be found
around supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and also in
our Galaxy around stellar mass compact objects and around young stars.
Notwithstanding the specific differences arising from such diversity in
physical extent, all these systems share a common feature where a central
object is fed from the accretion disc, due to the effect of turbulence and disc
instabilities, which are able to remove the angular momentum from the gas and
allow its accretion. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that
the gravitational field produced by the disc itself (the disc's self-gravity)
is an important ingredient in the models, especially in the context of
protostellar discs and of AGN discs. Indeed, it appears that in many cases (and
especially in the colder outer parts of the disc) the development of
gravitational instabilities can be one of the main agents in the redistribution
of angular momentum. In some cases, the instability can be strong enough to
lead to the formation of gravitationally bound clumps within the disc, and thus
to determine the disc fragmentation. As a result, progress in our understanding
of the dynamics of self-gravitating discs is essential to understand the
processes that lead to the feeding of both young stars and of supermassive
black holes in AGN. At the same time, understanding the fragmentation
conditions is important to determine under which conditions AGN discs would
fragment and form stars and whether protostellar discs might form giant gaseous
planets through disc fragmentation.

we attempt to measure this fraction as a function of luminosity by studying the

AGN. Because the mid-infrared is created by dust reprocessing of shorter
wavelength nuclear light, this ratio is a diagnostic of f_obsc, the fraction of
solid angle around the nucleus covered by obscuring matter. In order to
eliminate possible redshift-dependences while also achieving a large dynamic
range in luminosity, we have collected archival 24 micron MIPS photometry from
objects with z~1 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) and the Cosmic Evolution Survey
(COSMOS). To measure the bolometric luminosity for each object, we used
archival optical data supplemented by GALEX data. We find that the mean ratio
of 24 microns to bolometric luminosity decreases by a factor of ~3 in the
L_bol=10^44-3x10^47 ergs s^-1 range, but there is also a large scatter at
constant L_bol. Using radiation transfer solutions for model geometries, we
show how the IR/bolometric ratio relates to f_obsc and compare these values
with those obtained obtained from samples of X-ray selected AGN. Although we
find approximate agreement, our method indicates somewhat higher values of
f_obsc, particularly in the middle range of luminosities, suggesting that there
may be a significant number of heavily obscured AGN missed by X-ray surveys.

dimensional (1-D) linear chains, with exchange constant J1, are weakly coupled

magnetically ordered phases. We study the non-colinear spiral phases that arise
classically in the model and the colinear antiferromagnet that has been
recently proposed for the spin-half model by Starykh and Balents using a
Renormalization Group approach. We find that such phases can be stabilized in
the spin-half model for arbitrarily small coupling between the chains. For
vanishing coupling between the chains the energy of each phase must approach
that of decoupled linear chains. With increasing inter-chain coupling, the
non-colinear phase appears to have a lower energy in our calculations. For the
spin-one chain, we find that there is a critical interchain coupling needed to
overcome the Haldane gap. When spin-one chains are coupled in an unfrustrated
manner, the critical coupling is very small (~0.01J1) and agrees well with
previous chain mean-field studies. When they are coupled in the frustrated
triangular-lattice geometry, the critical coupling required to develop magnetic
order is substantially larger (> 0.3J1). The colinear phase is not obtained for
the spin-one Heisenberg model.

nuclear-spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 below Tc exhibits a T^3 behavior
without any coherence peak just below Tc, revealing the presence of line nodes
in the SC gap. In the normal state, 1/T_1 follows a \sqrt{T}-like behavior,
suggesting that the SC emerges under the non-Fermi liquid state dominated by
AFM spin fluctuations enhanced around quantum critical point (QCP). The reason
why the maximum Tc in CeIrSi3 is relatively high among the Ce-based

the use of fibre Bragg gratings to selectively remove hydroxyl emission lines
from the night sky spectrum. Fibre Bragg gratings should remove OH lines at
high resolution (R=10,000), with high suppression (30dB) whilst maintaining
high throughput (~90 per cent) between the lines. Devices currently under
construction should remove 150 lines in each of the J and H bands, effectively
making the night sky surface brightness ~4 magnitudes fainter. This background
reduction is greater than the improvement adapative optics makes over natural
seeing; photonic OH suppression is at least as important as adaptive optics for
the future of cosmology.
  We present a model of the NIR sky spectrum, and show that the interline
continuum is very faint (~80 ph/s/m^s/arcsec/micron on the ecliptic plane). We
show that OH suppression by high dispersion, i.e. `resolving out' the skylines,
cannot obtain the required level of sensitivity to reach the interline
continuum due to scattering of light. The OH lines must be suppressed prior to
dispersion.
  We have simulated observations employing fibre Bragg gratings of first light
objects, high redshift galaxies and cool, low-mass stars. The simulations are
of complete end-to-end systems from object to detector. The results demonstrate
that fibre Bragg grating OH suppression will significantly advance our
knowledge in many areas of astrophysics, and in particular will enable
rest-frame ultra-violet observations of the Universe at the time of first light

analytically, while in general it must be integrated numerically. Both methods
are claimed to be applicable for inhomogeneities of arbitrary strength and to
capture effects of the two-particle interaction, such as interaction dependent
exponents, up to leading order. We critically review this for the simplest case
of a single impurity. While on first glance the poor man's approach seems to
describe the crossover from the ``perfect'' to the ``open chain fixed point''
we collect evidence that difficulties may arise close to the ``perfect chain
fixed point''. Due to a subtle relation between the scaling dimensions of the
two fixed points this becomes apparent only in a detailed analysis. In the
functional renormalization group method the coupling of the different
scattering channels is kept which leads to a better description of the
underlying physics.

of the QSOs and also, compared the properties with those of a similarly
selected sample of 809 intervening systems (apparent relative velocity with
respect to the QSO of >3000km/s), so as to understand their origin. From the
analysis of the composite spectra, as well as from the comparison of measured
equivalent widths in individual spectra, we conclude that the associated Mg II
absorbers have higher apparent ionization, measured by the strength of the C IV
absorption lines compared to the Mg II absorption lines, than the intervening
absorbers. The ionization so measured appears to be related to apparent
ejection velocity, being lower as the apparent ejection velocity is more and
more positive. There is clear evidence, from the composite spectra, for SMC
like dust attenuation in these systems; the 2175AA absorption feature is not
present. The extinction is almost twice that observed in the similarly selected
sample of intervening systems. We reconfirm that QSOs with non-zero FIRST radio
flux are intrinsically redder than the QSOs with no detection in the FIRST
survey. The incidence of associated Mg II systems in QSOs with non-zero FIRST
radio flux is 1.7 times that in the QSOs with no detection in the FIRST survey.
The associated absorbers in radio-detected QSOs which comprise about 12% of our
sample, cause 3 times more reddening than the associated absorbers in
radio-undetected QSOs. This excess reddening possibly suggests an intrinsic
nature for the associated absorbers in radio-detected QSOs.

ambient intergalactic medium, whose properties are inferred from the
large-scale distribution in galaxies. The double lobes of the radio galaxy MSH
05-22 are giant--1.8 Mpc projected linear size--and interacting with the
environment outside the interstellar medium and coronal halo associated with
the host galaxy. The radio lobes appear to be relicts and the double structure
is asymmetric. We have examined the large-scale structure in the galaxy
distribution surrounding the radio source. The host galaxy of MSH 05-22 is
associated with a small group that lies close to the boundary of sheet-like and
filamentary density enhancements, and adjacent to a void. Assuming that the
galaxies trace gas, the asymmetries in the radio morphology in this case study
appear related to the anisotropy in the medium. However, the observed
overdensities and structure formation models for the heating of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) suggest a density-temperature product for the IGM
environment that is an order of magnitude below that expected from the
properties of the radio source. The discordance suggests that even sources like
MSH 05-22, which are observed in the relatively low-density IGM environment
associated with the filamentary large-scale structure and have multiple
signatures of being relicts, may be overpressured and evolving towards an
equilibrium relaxed state with the ambient IGM. Alternately, it is speculated
that astrophysical feedback originating in galaxy overdensities observed 1-2
Mpc to the N and NE of MSH 05-22 might be the mechanism for the heating of the
ambient IGM gas.

function of the energy density of the photon in a thermalized gas, at first in
the conventional U(1) gauge theory, followed by a calculation, where the photon
is identified with the massless gauge mode in deconfining SU(2) Yang-Mills
thermodynamics. Apart from the fact, that this calculation is interesting from
a technical point of view, we can consider several aspects of phenomenological
relevance. Since we interpret the two-point correlator of energy density as a
measure for the energy transfer, and thus for the electromagnetic interaction
of microscopic objects, such as atoms immersed into a photon gas, we are able
to give an explanation for the unexpected stability of cold, innergalactic
clouds consisting of atomic hydrogen.

Yang-Mills thermodynamics, which can be regarded as measure for the magnetic
flux through the area enclosed by the associated Wilson loop. On the level of
on-shell polarization effects for the massless mode we observe a perimeter-law,

repeat biopsies can be needed to target regions unsampled by previous biopsies
or resample critical regions (for example in case of cancer expectant
management or previous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia findings). From a
clinical point of view, it could be useful to control the 3D spatial
distribution of theses biopsies inside the prostate. Modern 3D-TRUS probes
allow acquiring high-quality volumes of the prostate in few seconds. We
developed a framework to track the prostate in 3D TRUS images. It means that if
one acquires a reference volume at the beginning of the session and another
during each biopsy, it is possible to determine the relationship between the
prostate in the reference and the others volumes by aligning images. We used
this tool to evaluate the ability of a single operator (a young urologist
assistant professor) to perform a pattern of 12 biopsies under 2D TRUS
guidance.

small-scale flux tubes with propagating MHD waves. To that aim, realistic flux
tubes showing internal structure have been excited with 5 min period drivers,
allowing non-linear waves to propagate inside the magnetic structure. The
observational signatures of these waves in Stokes profiles of several spectral
lines that are commonly used in spectropolarimetric measurements are discussed.

  before journal submission",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13407.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe Monte Carlo models for the dynamical evolution of the nearby
globular cluster M4. The code includes treatments of two-body relaxation,
three- and four-body interactions involving primordial binaries and those
formed dynamically, the Galactic tide, and the internal evolution of both
single and binary stars. We arrive at a set of initial parameters for the
cluster which, after 12Gyr of evolution, gives a model with a satisfactory
match to the surface brightness profile, the velocity dispersion profile, and
the luminosity function in two fields. We describe in particular the evolution
of the core, and find that M4 (which has a classic King profile) is actually a
post-collapse cluster, its core radius being sustained by binary burning. We
also consider the distribution of its binaries, including those which would be
observed as photometric binaries and as radial-velocity binaries. We also
consider the populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes and blue
stragglers, though not all channels for blue straggler formation are
represented yet in our simulations.

4150, and NGC 6340) and one SBa galaxy (NGC 2273) have been taken with the 6-m
telescope of the Special AstrophysicalObservatory of the Russian Academy of
Sciences aimed to study the structure and kinematic properties of early-type
disk galaxies. The radial profiles of the stellar radial velocities and the
velocity dispersion are measured. N-body simulations are used to construct
dynamical models of galaxies containing a stellar disk, bulge, and halo. The
masses of individual components are estimated formaximum-mass disk models. A
comparison of models with estimated rotational velocities and the stellar
velocity dispersion suggests that the stellar disks in lenticular galaxies are
""overheated""; i.e., there is a significant excess velocity dispersion over the
minimum level required to maintain the stability of the disk. This supports the
hypothesis that the stellar disks of S0 galaxies were subject to strong
gravitational perturbations. The relative thickness of the stellar disks in the
S0 galaxies considered substantially exceed the typical disk thickness of
spiral galaxies.
