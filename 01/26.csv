modern astrophysics and cosmology. We review the progress made by numerical
simulations carried out on large parallel supercomputers. Recent progress stems
from a combination of increased resolution and improved treatment of the
astrophysical processes modeled in the simulations, such as the
phenomenological description of the interstellar medium and of the process of
star formation. High mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition in
order to obtain large disks comparable with observed spiral galaxies avoiding
spurious dissipation of angular momentum. A realistic model of the star
formation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the stellar and
gaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description of
the non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy. We show that simulations of
gas collapse within cold dark matter halos including a phenomenological
description of supernovae blast-waves allow to obtain stellar disks with nearly
exponential surface density profiles as those observed in real disk galaxies,
counteracting the tendency of gas collapsing in such halos to form cuspy
baryonic profiles. However, the ab-initio formation of a realistic rotationally
supported disk galaxy with a pure exponential disk in a fully cosmological
simulation is still an open problem. We argue that the suppression of bulge
formation is related to the physics of galaxy formation during the merger of
the most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift, where the reionization
of the Universe likely plays a key role. A sufficiently high resolution during
this early phase of galaxy formation is also crucial to avoid artificial
angular momentum loss (Abridged).

simultaneous iodine calibration is used, and by 0.120 km/s (rms) without
simultaneous iodine calibration. Our results effectively show that a Michelson
interferometer coupled to a spectrograph allows precise measurements of
barycentric radial velocities even at a modest spectral resolution of R ~ 5100.
A multi-object version of the ET instrument capable of observing ~500 stars per

a wide-field radial velocity survey for extrasolar planets around TYCHO-2 stars
in the magnitude range 7.6<V<12. In addition to precise differential
velocities, this survey will also yield precise barycentric radial velocities
for many thousands of stars using the data analysis techniques reported here.
Such a large kinematic survey at high velocity precision will be useful in
identifying the signature of accretion events in the Milky Way and
understanding local stellar kinematics in addition to discovering exoplanets,
brown dwarfs and spectroscopic binaries.

presented, which involves choosing a suitable scheduling rule from a set for
each nurses assignment. Unlike our previous work that used Gas to implement
implicit learning, the learning in the proposed algorithm is explicit, ie.
Eventually, we will be able to identify and mix building blocks directly. The
Bayesian optimization algorithm is applied to implement such explicit learning
by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of solutions. The
conditional probability of each variable in the network is computed according
to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each new instance for
each variable is generated, ie in our case, a new rule string has been
obtained. Another set of rule strings will be generated in this way, some of
which will replace previous strings based on fitness selection. If stopping
conditions are not met, the conditional probabilities for all nodes in the
Bayesian network are updated again using the current set of promising rule
strings. Computational results from 52 real data instances demonstrate the
success of this approach. It is also suggested that the learning mechanism in
the proposed approach might be suitable for other scheduling problems.

authors attribute the first peak to the evaporation of a large number of
neutrons around the corresponding mass number; and the second peak to the
distribution of the primary fragment kinetic energy. Nevertheless, the
theoretical calculations related to primary distribution made by Faust et al.
do not result in a peak around m = 122. In order to clarify this apparent
controversy, we have made a numerical experiment in which the masses and the
kinetic energy of final fragments are calculated, assuming an initial
distribution of the kinetic energy without peaks on the standard deviation as
function of fragment mass. As a result we obtain a pronounced peak on the
standard deviation of the kinetic energy distribution around m = 109, a
depletion from m = 121 to m = 129, and an small peak around m = 122, which is
not as big as the measured by Belhafaf et al. Our simulation also reproduces
the experimental results on the yield of the final mass, the average number of
emitted neutrons as a function of the provisional mass (calculated from the
values of the final kinetic energy of the complementary fragments) and the

properties of the perovskite manganite La1.2Bi0.8Mn2-x(Ni/Co)xO6+d, with x =
0.0-0.8, has been investigated. It is observed that the ferromagnetism is
enhanced, TC being increased from 103 K for the parent compound (x = 0.0) to
178 K for Ni-phase, and to 181 K for the Co-phase (x = 0.8). Moreover, the
systems remain insulating and depict relatively large values of
magnetoresistance effect at low temperatures (up to 67 % at 90K and 70 kOe, for
x = 0.0 phase). These phenomena are interpreted by means of electronic phase
separation, where the ferromagnetic Mn4+/Ni2+ and Mn4+/Co2+ interactions
reinforce the Mn3+/Mn4+ interactions by super-exchange interaction. The
dielectric measurements below the magnetic transition temperatures exhibit weak
magneto-dielectric effect of around 0.25% at 80K, which may be due to
spin-lattice interaction.

spectrum shows that the nova had evolved to a pure supersoft X-ray source, with
no significant emission at energies above 1 keV. The X-ray light-curve shows
abrupt decreases and increases of the flux by a factor ~8. It is consistent
with a periodicity of 2.97 h, the orbital period suggested by Dobrotka et al.
(2007), although the observation lasted just a little more than a whole period.
We estimate the distance to V5116 Sgr to be 11+/-3 kpc. A simple blackbody
model does not fit correctly the EPIC spectra, with reduced chi^2>4. In
contrast, ONe rich white dwarf atmosphere models provide a good fit, with

burning in the white dwarf envelope. The white dwarf atmosphere temperature is
the same both in the low and the high flux periods, ruling out an intrinsic
variation of the X-ray source as the origin of the flux changes. We speculate
that the X-ray light-curve may result from a partial coverage by an asymmetric

of the two armchair band states to the metal 3d orbitals with matching symmetry
causing Fano resonances appearing as dips in the transmission function. The
spin type (majority/minority) being scattered depends on the adsorbate and is
explained in terms of d-state filling. The results are qualitatively reproduced

influence quantum effects can have on its appearance, and what quantum

coherent magnetic fields in a wide range of spiral galaxies. Radio-polarization
data show that these fields are strongly inclined towards the radial direction,
with pitch angles up to $35\degr$ and thus cannot be explained by differential
rotation alone. Global dynamo models describe the generation of the radial
magnetic field from the underlying turbulence via the so called
$\alpha$-effect. However, these global models still rely on crude assumptions
about the small-scale turbulence. To overcome these restrictions we perform
fully dynamical MHD simulations of interstellar turbulence driven by supernova
explosions. From our simulations we extract profiles of the contributing
diagonal elements of the dynamo $\alpha$-tensor as functions of galactic
height. We also measure the coefficients describing vertical pumping and find
that the ratio $\hat{\gamma}$ between these two effects has been overestimated
in earlier analytical work, where dynamo action seemed impossible. In
contradiction to these models based on isolated remnants we always find the
pumping to be directed inward. In addition we observe that $\hat{\gamma}$
depends on whether clustering in terms of super-bubbles is taken into account.

the vicinity of the critical point are shown. In particular, in the limit $p\to

exponents. Moreover, the spatial distribution of cracks (unvisited sites)
defines a fractal set over the spanned interval. Thus, from the perspective of
the covered territory, a very rich critical phenomenology is revealed in a

a short-range two-body potential and like atoms do not interact, are stable
even when the interspecies s-wave scattering length becomes infinitely large.
Solving the many-body Schroedinger equation within a hyperspherical framework
and by Monte Carlo techniques, this paper investigates how the properties of
trapped two-component gases change if a third or fourth component are added. If
all interspecies scattering lengths are equal and negative, our calculations
suggest that both three- and four-component Fermi gases become unstable for a
certain critical set of parameters. The relevant length scale associated with
the collapse is set by the interspecies scattering length and we argue that the
collapse is, similar to the collapse of an attractive trapped Bose gas, a
many-body phenomenon. Furthermore, we consider a three-component Fermi gas in
which two interspecies scattering lengths are negative while the other
interspecies scattering length is zero. In this case, the stability of the
Fermi system is predicted to depend appreciably on the range of the underlying
two-body potential. We find parameter combinations for which the system appears
to become unstable for a finite negative scattering length and parameter
combinations for which the system appears to be made up of weakly-bound trimers

system, whose nonunitary evolution (decoherence) towards a nonequilibrium
steady state is determined by carrier injection from the contacts. The purpose
of this paper is to provide a simple theoretical description of the
contact-induced decoherence in ballistic nanostructures, which is established
within the framework of the open systems theory. The active region's evolution
in the presence of contacts is generally non-Markovian. However, if the
contacts' energy relaxation due to electron-electron scattering is sufficiently
fast, then the contacts can be considered memoryless on timescales coarsened
over their energy relaxation time, and the evolution of the current-limiting
active region can be considered Markovian. Therefore, we first derive a general
Markovian map in the presence of a memoryless environment, by coarse-graining
the exact short-time non-Markovian dynamics of an abstract open system over the
environment memory-loss time, and we give the requirements for the validity of
this map. We then introduce a model contact-active region interaction that
describes carrier injection from the contacts for a generic two-terminal
ballistic nanostructure. Starting from this model interaction and using the
Markovian dynamics derived by coarse-graining over the effective memory-loss
time of the contacts, we derive the formulas for the nonequilibrium
steady-state distribution functions of the forward and backward propagating
states in the nanostructure's active region. On the example of a double-barrier
tunneling structure, the present approach yields an I-V curve with all the
prominent resonant features. The relationship to the Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker

string theory landscape and that its lifetime may allow for a discovery through
the observation of very energetic gamma-rays produced in the decay. Throats or,
equivalently, conformally sequestered hidden sectors are common in flux
compactifications and the energy deposited in these sectors can be calculated
if the reheating temperature of the standard model sector is known. Assuming
that throats with various warp factors are available in the compact manifold,
we determine which throats maximize the late-time abundance of sequestered dark
matter. For such throats, this abundance agrees with cosmological data if the
standard model reheating temperature was 10^10 - 10^11 GeV. In two distinct
scenarios, the mass of dark matter particles, i.e. the IR scale of the throat,
is either around 10^5 GeV or around 10^10 GeV. The lifetime and the decay
channels of our dark matter candidates depend crucially on the fact that the
Klebanov-Strassler throat is supersymmetric. Furthermore, the details of
supersymmetry breaking both in the throat and in the visible sector play an
essential role. We identify a number of scenarios where this type of dark
matter can be discovered via gamma-ray observations.

making the SXDS catalogs one of the largest multi-waveband catalogs in
corresponding depth and area coverage. The SXDS catalogs can be used for an
extensive range of astronomical applications such as the number density of the

resonance and fluorescence microscopy. By lowering the water/THF mixing ratio
X, the sequence unimers, micron-sized droplets, polymeric micelles was
observed. The transition between unimers and the micron-sized droplets occurred
at X = 0.75, whereas the microstructuration into core-shell polymeric micelles
was effective below X = 0.4. At intermediate mixing ratios, a coexistence
between the micron-sized droplets and the polymeric micelles was observed.
Combining the different aforementioned techniques, it was concluded that the
droplet dispersion resulted from a solvent partitioning that was induced by the
hydrophobic blocks. Comparison of poly(n-butyl acrylate) homopolymers and
poly(n-butyl acrylate)-b-poly(acrylic acid) block copolymers suggested that the
droplets were rich in THF and concentrated in copolymers and that they were
stabilized by the hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) moieties.

the source for flux-spectral variability on a time window of 10 days in the

in the X-ray, than in the optical band, with the 2-10 keV X-ray flux varying by

considering hot spot emission from a weakly magnetized rotating neutron star
(NS) covered by an optically-thick hydrogen atmosphere. We investigate the
limitations of using the thermal X-ray pulse profiles of MSPs to constrain the
mass-to-radius ($M/R$) ratio of the underlying NS. The accuracy is strongly
dependent on the viewing angle and magnetic inclination. For certain systems,
the accuracy is ultimately limited only by photon statistics implying that
future X-ray observatories could, in principle, achieve constraints on $M/R$
and hence the NS equation of state to better than $\sim$5%. We demonstrate that
valuable information regarding the basic properties of the NS can be extracted
even from X-ray data of fairly limited photon statistics through modeling of
archival spectroscopic and timing observations of the nearby isolated PSRs
J0030+0451 and J2124--3358. The X-ray emission from these pulsars is consistent
with the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere and a dipolar magnetic field
configuration, in agreement with previous findings for PSR J0437--4715. For
both MSPs, the favorable geometry allows us to place interesting limits on the
allowed $M/R$ of NSs. Assuming 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, the stellar radius is
constrained to be $R > 9.4$ km and $R > 7.8$ km (68% confidence) for PSRs

stellar models computed with a thoroughly tested evolution code. For the solar
giant stages, mass-loss by the cool (but not dust-driven) wind is considered in
detail. Using the new and well-calibrated mass-loss formula of Schroder & Cuntz
(2005, 2007), we find that the mass lost by the Sun as an RGB giant (0.332
M_Sun, 7.59 Gy from now) potentially gives planet Earth a significant orbital
expansion, inversely proportional to the remaining solar mass.
  According to these solar evolution models, the closest encounter of planet
Earth with the solar cool giant photosphere will occur during the tip-RGB
phase. During this critical episode, for each time-step of the evolution model,
we consider the loss of orbital angular momentum suffered by planet Earth from
tidal interaction with the giant Sun, as well as dynamical drag in the lower
chromosphere. We find that planet Earth will not be able to escape engulfment,
despite the positive effect of solar mass-loss. In order to survive the solar
tip-RGB phase, any hypothetical planet would require a present-day minimum
orbital radius of about 1.15 AU.
  Furthermore, our solar evolution models with detailed mass-loss description
predict that the resulting tip-AGB giant will not reach its tip-RGB size. The
main reason is the more significant amount of mass lost already in the RGB
phase of the Sun. Hence, the tip-AGB luminosity will come short of driving a
final, dust-driven superwind, and there will be no regular solar planetary
nebula (PN). But a last thermal pulse may produce a circumstellar (CS) shell
similar to, but rather smaller than, that of the peculiar PN IC 2149 with an
estimated total CS shell mass of just a few hundredths of a solar mass.

science, namely in the problem of sorting a permutation through a stack. A
formula for the number of permutations of length n that can be sorted by
passing it twice through a stack (where the letters on the stack have to be in
increasing order) was conjectured by West, and later proved by Zeilberger.
Goulden and West found a bijection from such permutations to nonseparable
planar maps, and later, Jacquard and Schaeffer presented a bijection from these
planar maps to certain labeled plane trees, called beta(1,0)-trees. Using
generating trees, Dulucq, Gire and West showed that nonseparable planar maps
are equinumerous with permutations avoiding the (classical) pattern 2413 and
the barred pattern 41\bar{3}52; they called these permutations nonseparable. We
give a new bijection between beta(1,0)-trees and permutations avoiding the
dashed patterns 3-1-4-2 and 2-41-3. These permutations can be seen to be
exactly the reverse of nonseparable permutations. Our bijection is built using
decompositions of the permutations and the trees, and it translates seven
statistics on the trees into statistics on the permutations. Among the
statistics involved are ascents, left-to-right minima and right-to-left maxima
for the permutations, and leaves and the rightmost and leftmost paths for the
trees. In connection with this we give a nontrivial involution on the
beta(1,0)-trees, which specializes to an involution on unlabeled rooted plane
trees, where it yields interesting results. Lastly, we conjecture the existence
of a bijection between nonseparable permutations and two-stack sortable

Mercury due to impacts by comets or asteroids, in order to study (1) meteorite
transfer to Earth, and (2) re-accumulation of an expelled mantle in

of meteorite transfer, we note that Mercury's impact ejecta leave the planet's
surface much faster (on average) than other planet's in the Solar System
because it is the only planet where impact speeds routinely range from 5-20
times the planet's escape speed. Thus, a large fraction of mercurian ejecta may
reach heliocentric orbit with speeds sufficiently high for Earth-crossing
orbits to exist immediately after impact, resulting in larger fractions of the
ejecta reaching Earth as meteorites. We calculate the delivery rate to Earth on
a time scale of 30 Myr and show that several percent of the high-speed ejecta
reach Earth (a factor of -3 less than typical launches from Mars); this is one
to two orders of magnitude more efficient than previous estimates. Similar
quantities of material reach Venus.
  These calculations also yield measurements of the re-accretion time scale of
material ejected from Mercury in a putative giant impact (assuming gravity is
dominant). For mercurian ejecta escaping the gravitational reach of the planet
with excess speeds equal to Mercury's escape speed, about one third of ejecta
re-accretes in as little as 2 Myr. Thus collisional stripping of a silicate
proto-mercurian mantle can only work effectively if the liberated mantle
material remains in small enough particles that radiation forces can drag them
into the Sun on time scale of a few million years, or Mercury would simply
re-accrete the material.

cosmological parameters. However, in doing such fits it is assumed that the
sampled supernovae are moving with the Hubble flow, i.e. that their peculiar
velocities are zero. In reality, peculiar velocities will modify supernova data
in a way that can impact best-fit cosmological parameters. We theoretically
quantify this effect in the nonlinear regime with a Monte-Carlo analysis, using
data from semi-analytic galaxy catalogs that are built from the Millennium
N-body simulation. We find scaling relations for the errors in best-fit
parameters resulting solely from peculiar velocities, as a function of the
total number of sources in a supernova survey N and its maximum redshift z_max.
For low redshift surveys, we find that these errors can be of the same order of
magnitude as the errors due to an intrinsic magnitude scatter of 0.1 mag. For a
survey with N=2000 and z_max=1.7, we estimate that the expected peculiar
velocity-induced errors in the best-fit cosmological constant density and
equation of state can be sigma_Lambda~0.009 and sigma_w~0.01, respectively,
which are subdominant to the errors due to the intrinsic scatter. We further
find that throwing away supernova data below a redshift z~0.01-0.02 can reduce
the combined error, due to peculiar velocities and the intrinsic scatter, but
by only about 10%.

advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low
spectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential
for use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of
multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission
protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are
developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols
with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source
user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merit that
the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In
addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network
coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be
obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.
  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed
protocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and
lower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD schemes and to existing
cooperative transmission protocols. From the simulation results, the
performance of the proposed scheme is near optimal as the performance gap is
0.12dB for average bit error rate (BER) 10^{-6} and 1.04dB for average BER

  new version. The presentation and organization of the new version, we
  believe, is easire to read. In addition, new simulation results have been
  added",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the requirements to ensure bounded mean queuing delay
and non-starvation in a slotted Aloha network operating the exponential backoff
protocol. It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted
Aloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation
throughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r =
e/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority
of prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the
Ethernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r =
2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise
objection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if
mean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2
is only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting
of r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve
sustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to
1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the
queuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper
also delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived
of service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.
Specifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that
the conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are
one of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when
mean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained
from simulation experiments may not converge. A quantitative discussion of this
issue is provided in this paper.

reduction. The order reduction method is implemented in Maple procedure, which
applicable to PDEs of different order with different number of independent
variables. Some of given PDEs are solved by order lifting to PDEs, which are
solvable by the subsequent order reduction.

  Networks","Proc. of WRECOM '07: Wireless Rural and Emergency Communications
  Conference, Roma (Italy), October 2007",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC",,"  In this paper, a reliability analysis is carried out to state a performance
comparison between two recently proposed proactive routing algorithms. These
protocols are able to scale in ad hoc and sensor networks by resorting to
dynamic addressing, to face with the topology variability, which is typical of
ad hoc, and sensor networks. Numerical simulations are also carried out to
corroborate the results of the analysis.

  towards the LMC and the SMC","accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12994.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Using the OGLE catalogue of eclipsing binaries, 15 contact binaries were
identified towards the SMC and the LMC at vertical distances from the Galactic
plane between 300 pc and 10 kpc. Based on the luminosity function calculated
for these contact binaries, we estimated a frequency of occurrence relative to
Main Sequence stars in the thick disk at roughly 1/600. This estimate suffers
from the small number statistics, but is consistent with the value previously
found for the solar neighbourhood.
