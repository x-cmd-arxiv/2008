the age order for some of the clusters of Mayne et al (2007). The new

largest remaining uncertainty in deriving an age ordering (and necessarily
ages) is metallicity. We also discuss the use of a feature we term the R-C gap
overlap to provide a diagnostic of isochronal age spreads or varying accretion
histories within a given star-formation-region. Finally, recent derivations of

completely different to the situation that holds in general relativity, where
an isotropic initial cosmological singularity is unstable in vacuum and under a
wide range of non-vacuum conditions. We show that when $n\neq 1$, although a
special isotropic vacuum solution found by Clifton and Barrow always exists, it
is no longer stable when the initial singularity is approached. We find the
particular stability conditions under the influence of tensor, vector, and

behavior of the O$(n)$ symmetric anisotropic $\phi^4$ lattice model with
periodic boundary conditions in a $d$-dimensional hypercubic geometry above, at

the bulk order-parameter correlation function, the bulk scattering intensity,
and for several universal bulk amplitude relations. For the confined system,
renormalization-group theory within the minimal subtraction scheme at fixed
dimension $d$ for $2<d<4$ is employed. For the case of cubic symmetry and for
$n=1$ our perturbation approach yields excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo
(MC) data for the finite-size amplitude of the free energy of the
three-dimensional Ising model at $T_c$ by Mon [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 54}, 2671
(1985)]. Below $T_c$ a minimum of the scaling function of the excess free
energy is found. We predict a measurable dependence of this minimum on the
anisotropy parameters. The relative anisotropy effect on the free energy is
predicted to be significantly larger than that on the Binder cumulant. Our
theory agrees quantitatively with the non-monotonic dependence of the Binder
cumulant on the ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor (NNN) coupling of the
two-dimensional Ising model found by MC simulations of Selke and Shchur [J.
Phys. {\bf A 38}, L739 (2005)]. Our theory also predicts a non-monotonic
dependence for small values of the {\it antiferromagnetic} NNN coupling and the
existence of a Lifschitz point at a larger value of this coupling. The
nonuniversal anisotropy effects in the finite-size scaling regime are predicted
to satisfy a kind of restricted universality. The tails of the large-$L$
behavior at $T \neq T_c$ violate both finite-size scaling and universality.

  (Japan), 3-7 December 2007",,,"IFT-UAM/CSIC-08-05","gr-qc astro-ph hep-ph",,"  The reheating of the universe after hybrid inflation proceeds through the
nucleation and subsequent collision of large concentrations of energy density
in the form of bubble-like structures moving at relativistic speeds. This
generates a significant fraction of energy in the form of a stochastic
background of gravitational waves, whose time evolution is determined by the
successive stages of reheating: First, tachyonic preheating makes the amplitude
of gravity waves grow exponentially fast. Second, bubble collisions add a new
burst of gravitational radiation. Third, turbulent motions finally sets the end
of gravitational waves production. From then on, these waves propagate
unimpeded to us. We find that the fraction of energy density today in these
primordial gravitational waves could be significant for GUT scale models of
inflation, although well beyond the frequency range sensitivity of
gravitational wave observatories like LIGO, LISA or BBO. However, low-scale
models could still produce a detectable signal at frequencies accessible to BBO
or DECIGO. For comparison, we have also computed the analogous background from
some chaotic inflation models and obtained similar results to those of other
groups. The discovery of such a background would open a new observational
window into the very early universe, where the details of the process of
reheating could be explored. Thus, it could also serve as a new experimental
tool for testing the Inflationary Paradigm.

  Implementation","24 pages, LaTeX, 1 figure","Phys.Rev.D77:125006,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.125006",,"hep-th",,"  In a previous companion paper [arXiv:0712.3532], we proposed two new
regulators for quantum field theories in spacetimes with compactified extra
dimensions. Unlike most other regulators which have been used in the
extra-dimension literature, these regulators are specifically designed to
respect the original higher-dimensional Lorentz and gauge symmetries that exist
prior to compactification, and not merely the four-dimensional symmetries which
remain afterward. In this paper, we use these regulators in order to develop a
method for extracting ultraviolet-finite results from one-loop calculations.
This method also allows us to derive Wilsonian effective field theories for
Kaluza-Klein modes at different energy scales. Our method operates by ensuring
that divergent corrections to parameters describing the physics of the excited
Kaluza-Klein modes are absorbed into the corresponding parameters for zero
modes, thereby eliminating the need to introduce independent counterterms for
parameters characterizing different Kaluza-Klein modes. Our effective field
theories can therefore simplify calculations involving Kaluza-Klein modes, and
be compared directly to potential experimental results emerging from collider
data.

constructed by connecting every pair of nodes with probability $p$. We
numerically calculate the ensemble averaged transition probability of quantum

the limiting transition probability is reached very quickly. For infinite
networks whose spectral density follows the semicircle law, the efficiencies of
the classical and quantum-mechanical transport are compared on networks of
different average degree. In the long time limiting, we consider the
distribution of the ensemble averaged transition probabilities, and show that
there is a high probability to find the exciton at the initial node. Such high
return probability almost do not alter in a wide range of connection
probability p but increases rapidly when the network approaches to be fully
connected. For networks whose topology is not extremely connected, the return
probability is inversely proportional to the network size N. Furthermore, the
transport dynamics are compared with that on a random graph model in which the
degree of each node equals to the average degree of the Erdos-Renyi networks.

Through some numerical examples, it is shown that the density of states is
strongly dependent on the incident electron energy, the strength and frequency

lead-nanotube coupling energy, the system conductance decreases with increasing
the field strength and increases with increasing the field frequency

tested here for the existence of triaxial equilibrium solutions. Using the
non-negative least square method, we show that self-consistent triaxial
galaxies exist for baryonic models with a mild density cusp $\rho \sim {\Sigma
\over r}$. Self-consistency is achieved for a wide range of central
concentrations, $\Sigma \sim 10-1000\mathrm{M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, representing
low-to-high surface brightness galaxies. Our results demonstrate for the first
time that the orbit superposition technique is fruitful for constructing galaxy
models beyond Newtonian gravity, and triaxial cuspy galaxies might exist
without the help of Cold dark Matter.

  algebra of type Z/lZ","40 pages, To appear in J. Math. Kyoto Univ",,,,"math.RT math.AG",,"  We study the representation theory of the rational Cherednik algebra
$H_\kappa = H_\kappa({\mathbb Z}_l)$ for the cyclic group ${\mathbb Z}_l =
{\mathbb Z} / l {\mathbb Z}$ and its connection with the geometry of the quiver
variety $M_\theta(\delta)$ of type $A_{l-1}^{(1)}$.
  We consider a functor between the categories of $H_\kappa$-modules with
different parameters, called the shift functor, and give the condition when it
is an equivalence of categories.
  We also consider a functor from the category of $H_\kappa$-modules with good
filtration to the category of coherent sheaves on $M_\theta(\delta)$. We prove
that the image of the regular representation of $H_\kappa$ by this functor is
the tautological bundle on $M_\theta(\delta)$. As a corollary, we determine the
characteristic cycles of the standard modules. It gives an affirmative answer
to a conjecture given in [Gordon, arXiv:math/0703150v1] in the case of
${\mathbb Z}_l$.
