occurrence in the two number sequences SQ1 and SQ2. All non-prime numbers in
SQ1 and SQ2 are caused by recurrences of these two number sequences with
increasing wave-lengths in themselves, in a similar fashion as Overtones

of dissipation of the surrounding envelope, whose main effects are the
extinction of the optical radiation from the central YSO and re-emission in the
far-infrared. Since extinction is a property of column density along the line
of sight, the presence of a protoplanetary disk may lead to a misclassification
when the system is viewed edge-on.
  We performed radiative transfer calculations, using the axysimmetric 3D
radiative transfer codes RADMC and RADICAL, to show the effects of different
geometries on the main indicators of YSO evolutionary stage, like the slope of
the flux between 2 and 24mum, the bolometric temperature and the optical depth
of silicates and ices.
  We show that for systems viewed at intermediate angles the 'classical'
indicators of evolution accurately trace the envelope column density, and they
all agree with each other. On the other hand, edge-on system are misclassified
for inclinations larger than ~65deg. In particular, silicate emission, typical
of pre-main sequence stars with disks, turns into absorption when the disk
column density reaches 1e22cm-2, corresponding e.g. to a 5e-3 Msun flaring disk
viewed at 64deg. A similar effect is noticed in all the other classification
indicators studied alpha, Tbol, and the H2O and CO2 ices absorption strengths.
This misclassification has a big impact on the nature of the flat-spectrum
sources (alpha ~0), whose number can be explained by simple geometrical
arguments without invoking evolution. A reliable classification scheme using a
minimal number of observations is constituted by observations of the mm-flux
with both a single dish and an interferometer.

connecting two points $A$, $B$ at distance $\le n$ avoiding a large enough ball
around a third point $C$. We characterize groups with non-linear divergence
functions as groups having cut-points in their asymptotic cones. By
Olshanskii-Osin-Sapir, that property is weaker than the property of having
Morse (rank 1) quasi-geodesics. Using our characterization of Morse
quasi-geodesics, we give a new proof of the theorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur
that states that mapping class groups cannot contain copies of irreducible
lattices in semi-simple Lie groups of higher ranks. It also gives a
generalization of the result of Birman-Lubotzky-McCarthy about solvable
subgroups of mapping class groups not covered by the Tits alternative of Ivanov
and McCarthy.
  We show that any group acting acylindrically on a simplicial tree or a
locally compact hyperbolic graph always has ""many"" periodic Morse
quasi-geodesics (i.e. Morse elements), so its divergence functions are never
linear. We also show that the same result holds in many cases when the
hyperbolic graph satisfies Bowditch's properties that are weaker than local
compactness. This gives a new proof of Behrstock's result that every
pseudo-Anosov element in a mapping class group is Morse.
  On the other hand, we conjecture that lattices in semi-simple Lie groups of
higher rank always have linear divergence. We prove it in the case when the
$\mathbb{Q}$-rank is 1 and when the lattice is $SL_n(\mathcal{O}_S)$ where
$n\ge 3$, $S$ is a finite set of valuations of a number field $K$ including all
infinite valuations, and $\mathcal{O}_S$ is the corresponding ring of

synchronous-recycling interferometer is best at these sensitivity. In this
paper, we investigated the optimal location of two synchronous-recycling
interferometers and derived their cross-correlation sensitivity to GWB. We
found that the sensitivity is nearly optimized and hardly changed if two
coaligned detectors are located within a range 0.2 m, and that the sensitivity
achievable in an experiment is far below compared with the constraint
previously obtained in experiments.

has finitely many isomorphism classes. This class of graphs includes the Cayley
graphs of amalgamated products, HNN extensions or general groups acting on
trees. It also includes all transitive graphs with more than one end. The idea
of the method is to find a multi-type Galton--Watson branching process (with a
parameter $p$) which has finite expected population size if and only if the
expected percolation cluster size is finite. This provides sufficient
information about $p_c$. In particular, if the pairwise intersections of pieces
are finite, then $p_c$ is the smallest positive $p$ such that $\operatorname
{det}(M-1)=0$, where $M$ is the first-moment matrix of the branching process.
If the pieces of the tree-like structure are finite, then $p_c$ is an algebraic
number and we give an algorithm computing $p_c$ as a root of some algebraic
function. We show that any Cayley graph of a virtually free group (i.e., a
group acting on a tree with finite vertex stabilizers) with respect to any
finite generating set has a tree-like structure with finite pieces. In
particular, we show how to compute $p_c$ for the Cayley graph of a free group

microns in a nulling mode. By fitting the unique KIN data, we have obtained an
angular size of the mid-infrared continuum of 6.2, 4.0, or 5.4 mas for a disk
profile, gaussian profile (FWHM), and shell profile respectively. The data show
evidence of enhanced neutral atomic hydrogen emission and atomic metals
including silicon located in the inner spatial regime near the white dwarf (WD)
relative to the outer regime. There are also nebular emission lines and
evidence of hot silicate dust in the outer spatial region, centered at ! 17 AU
from the WD, that are not found in the inner regime. Our evidence suggests that
these features have been excited by the nova flash in the outer spatial regime
before the blast wave reached these regions. These identifications support a
model in which the dust appears to be present between outbursts and is not

number of electrons is a universal scaling function of xi_K/L. If we take into
account electron-electron interactions in a single-channel wire, this ratio
also depends on the parameters of the effective Luttinger model; in addition,
the scaling is weakly violated by a marginal bulk interaction. For the geometry

discovered to date. We report here the results of our analysis of its aperiodic
X-ray variability, as measured with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the
2007 outburst of the source. We detect strong (~35%) flat-topped broadband
noise throughout the outburst with low characteristic frequencies (~0.1 Hz).
This makes SWIFT J1756.9-2508 similar to the rest of AMPs and to other low
luminosity accreting neutron stars when they are in their hard states, and
enables us to classify this AMP as an atoll source in the extreme island state.
We also find a hard tail in its energy spectrum extending up to 100 keV, fully
consistent with such source and state classification.

propagating time, increases with the connectivity parameter m for both the

the increase of the shortest distance while the transport (speed) of CTQWs
turns out to be a constant value. In the long time limit, depending on the

being at the opposite node, which also depends on the precise value of

  http://www.electrostatic.com/bookstore/books/2002jointproc.htm",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  Gauss' law and the equation of continuity must be satisfied in all materials
be they solids, liquids or gases. Most materials are classified as simple
materials; i.e., their electrical properties are linear, isotropic and
homogeneous. Charge transport in these simple materials should be described by
a constitutive equation known as Ohm's law. When Ohm's law is combined with
Gauss' law and the equation of continuity, a differential equation for volume
charge density relaxation results. The usual solution to this equation shows
that charge decays exponentially with a relaxation time given by the material's
permittivity divided by its electrical conductivity. Experiments show that good
conductors follow this exponential decay but that poor conductors (insulators)
tend to follow a decay that initially is more hyperbolic than exponential. This
suggests that either Ohm's law is not valid for insulator materials or that a
deeper understanding of Ohm's law is needed to explain charge decay in these
less than good conductors. This paper examines the latter approach and shows
that, when all the free charges within a simple material are taken into
account, a new unipolar charge decay equation is derived which is valid for any
simple material: conductor, insulator or anywhere in between. For good
conductors the equation reduces to the standard exponential law of decay. For
very poor conductors it reduces to the Vellenga-Klinkenberg modified hyperbolic
law with the initial decay producing the characteristic Bustin hyperbolic law
of decay. Explicit definitions for a good conductor and a good insulator are
obtained and are used to define the range where explicit deviations from both
of these hyperbolic laws occur.

been poor. Here we report a substantial improvement in the method which we have
achieved by simultaneous optimisation of the thousands of coefficients that

the model provides an accurate representation of the data over the full 63 dB
dynamic range of the observations: residual differences between model and data
are noise-like. The advent of interstellar holography enables detailed
quantitative investigation of the interstellar radio-wave propagation paths for
a given pulsar at each epoch of observation; we illustrate this using our test
data which show the scattering material to be structured and highly
anisotropic. The temporal response of the medium exhibits a scattering tail out
to beyond 100 microsec and a pulse arrival time measurement at this frequency
and this epoch of observation would be affected by a mean delay of 15 microsec
due to multipath propagation in the interstellar medium.

metallicities, parametrized by [Fe/H], are all below -2. Six of our program
objects exhibit high abundance ratios of barium ([Ba/H]> +1), suggesting large
contributions of the products of former AGB companions via mass transfer across
binary systems. Combining our results with previous studies provides a total of
20 CEMP main-sequence turn-off stars for which the abundances of carbon and at
least some neutron-capture elements are determined. Inspection of the [C/H]
ratios for this sample of CEMP turn-off stars show that they are generally
higher than those of CEMP giants; their dispersion in this ratio is also
smaller. We take these results to indicate that the carbon-enhanced material
provided from the companion AGB star is preserved at the surface of turn-off
stars with no significant dilution. In contrast, a large dispersion in the
observed [Ba/H] is found for the sample of CEMP turn-off stars, suggesting that
the efficiency of the s-process in very metal-poor AGB stars may differ greatly

drift at 972 nm between two external cavity diode lasers independently
stabilized to two vertically mounted Fabry-Perot (FP) reference cavities.
Vertical FP reference cavities are suspended in mid-plane such that the
influence of vertical vibrations to the mirror separation is significantly
suppressed. This makes the setup virtually immune for vertical vibrations that
are more difficult to isolate than the horizontal vibrations. To compensate for
thermal drifts the FP spacers are made from Ultra-Low-Expansion (ULE) glass
which possesses a zero linear expansion coefficient. A new design using Peltier
elements in vacuum allows operation at an optimal temperature where the
quadratic temperature expansion of the ULE could be eliminated as well. The
measured linear drift of such ULE FP cavity of 63 mHz/s was due to material
aging and the residual frequency fluctuations were less than 40 Hz during 16
hours of measurement. Some part of the temperature-caused drift is attributed
to the thermal expansion of the mirror coatings. High-frequency thermal
fluctuations that cause vibrations of the mirror surfaces limit the stability
of a well designed reference cavity. By comparing two similar laser systems we
obtain an Allan instability of 2*10-15 between 0.1 and 10 s averaging time,
which is close to the theoretical thermal noise limit.

observations of nearby molecular clouds and discuss them in the context of
various contemporary scenarios for cloud core formation and evolution. None of
the extreme scenarios can explain all observations. Pure laminar ambipolar
diffusion has relatively long growth times for typical ionization levels and
has difficulty satisfying core lifetime constraints. Purely hydrodynamic
pictures have trouble accounting for the inefficiency of core formation and the
detailed velocity structure of individual cores. A possible favorable scenario
is a mixed model involving gravitational fragmentation of turbulent molecular
clouds close to magnetic criticality. The evolution of the magnetic field and
angular momentum in individual cloud cores after the onset of gravitational
collapse is also discussed. In particular, we stress the importance of
radiation-magnetohydrodynamical processes and resistive MHD effects during the
protostellar phase. We also emphasize the role of the formation of the
short-lived first (protostellar) core in providing a chance for
sub-fragmentation into binary systems and triggering MHD outflows. Future
submillimeter facilities such as Herschel and ALMA will soon provide major new
observational constraints in this field. On the theoretical side, an important
challenge for the future will be to link the formation of molecular clouds and
prestellar cores in a coherent picture.

containing 39 newly found sources. In order to classify and identify more of
the sources we search for X-ray time variability in XMM-Newton archival data of
the M 31 centre field.
  As a source list we used our extended catalogue based on observations
covering the time span from June 2000 to July 2004. We then determined the flux
or at least an upper limit at the source positions for each observation.
Deriving the flux ratios for the different observations and searching for the
maximum flux difference we determined variability factors. We also calculated
the significance of the flux ratios.
  Using hardness ratios, X-ray variability and cross correlations with
catalogues in the X-ray, optical, infrared and radio regimes, we detected three
super soft source candidates, one supernova remnant and six supernova remnant
candidates, one globular cluster candidate, three X-ray binaries and four X-ray
binary candidates. Additionally we identified one foreground star candidate and
classified fifteen sources with hard spectra, which may either be X-ray
binaries or Crab-like supernova remnants in M 31 or background active galactic
nuclei. The remaining five sources stay unidentified or without classification.
Based on the time variability results we suggest six sources, which were
formerly classified as ""hard"", to be X-ray binary candidates. The
classification of one other source (XMMM31 J004236.7+411349) as a supernova
remnant, has to be rejected due to the distinct time variability we found. We
now classify this source as a foreground star.

counterpart and plays a decisive role in quantum information theory. Several
protocols, like the teleportation, are based on quantum entangled states.
Moreover, any quantum algorithm which does not create entanglement can be
efficiently simulated on a classical computer. The exact role of the
entanglement is nevertheless not well understood. Since an exact analysis of
entanglement evolution induces an exponential slowdown, we consider
approximative analysis based on the framework of abstract interpretation. In
this paper, a concrete quantum semantics based on superoperators is associated
with a simple quantum programming language. The representation of entanglement,
i.e. the design of the abstract domain is a key issue. A representation of
entanglement as a partition of the memory is chosen. An abstract semantics is
introduced, and the soundness of the approximation is proven.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.DS",,"  We study scheduling problems motivated by recently developed techniques for
microprocessor thermal management at the operating systems level. The general
scenario can be described as follows. The microprocessor's temperature is
controlled by the hardware thermal management system that continuously monitors
the chip temperature and automatically reduces the processor's speed as soon as
the thermal threshold is exceeded. Some tasks are more CPU-intensive than other
and thus generate more heat during execution. The cooling system operates
non-stop, reducing (at an exponential rate) the deviation of the processor's
temperature from the ambient temperature. As a result, the processor's
temperature, and thus the performance as well, depends on the order of the task
execution. Given a variety of possible underlying architectures, models for
cooling and for hardware thermal management, as well as types of tasks, this
scenario gives rise to a plethora of interesting and never studied scheduling
problems.
  We focus on scheduling real-time jobs in a simplified model for cooling and
thermal management. A collection of unit-length jobs is given, each job
specified by its release time, deadline and heat contribution. If, at some time
step, the temperature of the system is t and the processor executes a job with
heat contribution h, then the temperature at the next step is (t+h)/2. The
temperature cannot exceed the given thermal threshold T. The objective is to
maximize the throughput, that is, the number of tasks that meet their
deadlines. We prove that, in the offline case, computing the optimum schedule
is NP-hard, even if all jobs are released at the same time. In the online case,
we show a 2-competitive deterministic algorithm and a matching lower bound.

promising mechanisms for coupling AGN activity to the surrounding intracluster
medium (ICM), and so offsetting cooling in cluster cores. We present a detailed
analysis of the weak shock found in deep Chandra observations of the Perseus
cluster core. A comparison of the spectra either side of the shock front shows
that they are very similar. By performing a deprojection analysis of a sector
containing the shock, we produce temperature and density profiles across the
shock front. These show no evidence for a temperature jump coincident with the
density jump. To understand this result, we model the shock formation using 1D
hydrodynamic simulations including models with thermal conduction and gamma <
5/3 gas. These models do not agree well with the data, suggesting that further
physics is needed to explain the shock structure. We suggest that an
interaction between the shock and the H-alpha filaments could have a
significant effect on cooling the post-shock gas.
  We also calculate the thermal energy liberated by the weak shock. The total
energy in the shocked region is about 3.5 times the work needed to inflate the
bubbles adiabatically, and the power of the shock is around 6x10^44 erg/s per
bubble, just over 10^45 erg/s in total.

the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy: one can always rescale the density
distribution of the lens and add a constant-density mass-sheet such that the,
also properly rescaled, source plane is projected onto the same observed
images. For strong lensing systems, it is often claimed that this degeneracy is
broken as soon as two or more sources at different redshifts are available.
This is definitely true in the strict sense that it is then impossible to add a
constant-density mass-sheet to the rescaled density of the lens without
affecting the resulting images. However, often one can easily construct a more
general mass distribution -- instead of a constant-density sheet of mass --
which gives rise to the same effect: a uniform scaling of the sources involved
without affecting the observed images. We show that this can be achieved by
adding one or more circularly symmetric mass distributions, each with its own
center of symmetry, to the rescaled mass distribution of the original lens. As
it uses circularly symmetric distributions, this procedure can lead to the
introduction of ring shaped features in the mass distribution of the lens. In
this paper, we show explicitly how degenerate inversions for a given strong
lensing system can be constructed. It then becomes clear that many constraints
are needed to effectively break this degeneracy.

fact that the time-evolved numerical solutions of the discrete spin EOM closely
track the corresponding time-evolved solutions of the continuum equation. Of

that these characteristics are also exhibited by the corresponding solutions of

important concepts from neuroscience: facilitation of neuronal firing and
nearly simultaneous beginning of activation of sets of neurons. More
specifically, integrate-and-fire complex neuronal networks are activated at
each of their nodes, and the dissemination of activation is monitored. As the
activation received by each neuron accumulates, its firing gets facilitated.
The time it takes for each neuron, other than the source, to receive the first
non-zero input (beginning activation time) and the time for it to produce the
first spike (beginning spiking time) are identified through simulations. It is
shown, with respect to two synthetic and a real-world (\emph{C. elegans})
neuronal complex networks, that the patterns of beginning activation times (and
to a lesser extent also of the spiking times) tend to cluster into groups
corresponding to communities of neurons in the original complex neuronal
network. Such an effect is identified to be a direct consequence of the almost
simultaneous activation between the nodes inside the same community in which
the source of activation is placed, as well as of the respective trapping of
activation implied by the integration of activiation prior to firing.
Interestingly, the accumulation of activity and thresholds inside each neuron
were found to be essential for constraining the initial activations within each
respective community during the transient activation (no clear clusters were
observed when using overall activation or spiking rates). In addition to its
intrinsic value for neuroscience and structure-dynamics studies, these results
confirm the importance of the consideration of transient dynamics in complex
systems investigations.

For OB supergiants with moderate mass loss rates and a wind velocity

and wind parameters of OB supergiants over the last few years suggest, however,
that for many objects \beta is much higher than 1.0, reaching values up to 3.5.
We investigate the influence of the free-free and free-bound emission on the
emerging radiation, especially at optical wavelengths, from OB supergiants
having wind velocity distributions with \beta > 1. For the case of a
spherically symmetric, isothermal wind in local thermodynamical equilibrium

wind continuum and especially focus on the influence of a \beta-type wind
velocity distribution with \beta > 1 on the formation of the wind continuum at
optical wavelengths. The optical wind continuum is found to be generated within
about 2 R_* which is exactly the wind region where \beta strongly influences
the density distribution. We find that for \beta > 1, the continuum of a
typical OB supergiant can indeed be contaminated with thermal wind emission,
even at optical wavelengths. The strong increase in the optical wind emission
is dominantly produced by free-bound processes.

gene-expression profile or signature characteristic of the event. Using a
suitably robust algorithm these signatures can potentially be used to connect
molecules with similar pharmacological or toxicological properties. The
Connectivity Map was a novel concept and innovative tool first introduced by
Lamb et al to connect small molecules, genes, and diseases using genomic
signatures [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313, 1929-1935]. However, the
Connectivity Map had some limitations, particularly there was no effective
safeguard against false connections if the observed connections were considered
on an individual-by-individual basis. Further when several connections to the
same small-molecule compound were viewed as a set, the implicit null hypothesis
tested was not the most relevant one for the discovery of real connections.
Here we propose a simple and robust method for constructing the reference
gene-expression profiles and a new connection scoring scheme, which importantly
allows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections
observed. We tested the new method with the two example gene-signatures (HDAC
inhibitors and Estrogens) used by Lamb et al and also a new gene signature of
immunosuppressive drugs. Our testing with this new method shows that it
achieves a higher level of specificity and sensitivity than the original
method. For example, our method successfully identified raloxifene and
tamoxifen as having significant anti-estrogen effects, while Lamb et al's
Connectivity Map failed to identify these. With these properties our new method
has potential use in drug development for the recognition of pharmacological
and toxicological properties in new drug candidates.

equations for the electromagnetic waves which together with the generating
source, a traveling oscillatory charge of zero rest mass, comprise a particle
traveling in the force field of an usual conservative potential and an
additional frictional force $f$. At the de Broglie wavelength scale and in the
classic-velocity limit, the total wave equation decomposes into a component
equation describing the particle kinetic motion, which for $f=0$ identifies
with the usual linear Schr\""odinger equation as previously. The $f$-dependent
probability density presents generally an observable diffusion current of a
real diffusion constant; this and the particle's usual quantum diffusion
current as a whole are under adiabatic condition conserved and obey the
Fokker-Planck equation. The corresponding extra, $f$-dependent term in the
Hamiltonian operator identifies with that obtained by H.-D. Doebner and G.A.
Goldin. The friction produces to the particle's wave amplitude a damping that
can describe well the effect due to a radiation (de)polarization field, which
is always by-produced by the particle's oscillatory charge in a (nonpolar)
dielectric medium. The radiation depolarization field in a dielectric vacuum
has two separate significances: it participates to exert on another particle an
attractive, depolarization radiation force which resembles in overall respects
Newton's universal gravity as we showed earlier, and it exerts on the particle
itself an attractive, self depolarization radiation force whose time rate gives
directly the frictional force $f$.

suppression pattern of charmonia at RHIC with respect to centrality and

the ratio of the forward to mid-rapidity nuclear modification factors of J/Psi
(R_AA (forward) / R_AA (mid)) cannot be explained by the interactions with
'formed' comoving mesons or by the 'color screening mechanism' alone. Only when
incorporating interactions of the c or c-bar quark with a pre-hadronic medium
satisfactory results are obtained. A detailed comparison to the PHENIX data
demonstrates that non-hadronic interactions are mandatory to describe the
narrowing of the J/Psi rapidity distribution from p+p to central Au+Au
collisions. The Psi' to J/Psi ratio is found to be crucial in disentangling the
different charmonium absorption scenarios especially in the RHIC energy range.
Furthermore, a comparison of the transport calculations to the statistical
model of Gorenstein and Gazdzicki as well as the statistical hadronization
model of Andronic et al. shows differences in the energy dependence as well as
centrality dependence of the J/Psi to pion ratio which may be exploited
experimentally to disentangle different concepts. We find additionally that the
collective flow of charm in the HSD transport appears compatible with the data
at SPS energies but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC energies
such that the large elliptic flow v_2 of charm seen experimentally has to be
attributed to early interactions of non-hadronic degrees of freedom.

reductions in strength when the black hole is in the foreground due to the
X-ray ionization of the wind ions. A comparison of HST and archival IUE spectra
shows that similar photoionization effects occur in both the X-ray states. We
constructed model UV wind line profiles assuming that X-ray ionization occurs
everywhere in the wind except the zone where the supergiant blocks the X-ray
flux. The good match between the observed and model profiles indicates that the
wind ionization extends to near to the hemisphere of the supergiant facing the
X-ray source. The H-alpha emission strength is generally lower in the high/soft
state compared to the low/hard state, but the He II 4686 emission is relatively
constant between states. The results suggest that mass transfer in Cyg X-1 is
dominated by a focused wind flow that peaks along the axis joining the stars
and that the stellar wind contribution is shut down by X-ray photoionization
effects. The strong stellar wind from the shadowed side of the supergiant will
stall when Coriolis deflection brings the gas into the region of X-ray
illumination. This stalled gas component may be overtaken by the orbital motion
of the black hole and act to inhibit accretion from the focused wind. The
variations in the strength of the shadow wind component may then lead to
accretion rate changes that ultimately determine the X-ray state.

the development of analytic fits to full numerical waveforms. The models and

incorporating information about the known hierarchical classification of the
target family and about key residues in their inferred binding pockets
significantly improves the prediction accuracy of our model. In particular we
are able to predict ligands of orphan GPCRs with an estimated accuracy of
78.1%.

of conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (C-GRBs) observed during the same
period. We confirm the correlation between Epeak_obs and fluence noted by
others and find further evidence that XRFs, XRRs and C-GRBs form a continuum.
We also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with the
correlation between the peak energy in the GRB rest frame (Epeak_src) and the
isotropic radiated energy (Eiso), so called the Epeak_src-Eiso relation. The
spectral properties of X-ray afterglows of XRFs and C-GRBs are similar, but the
temporal properties of XRFs and C-GRBs are quite different. We found that the
light curves of C-GRB afterglows show a break to steeper indices
(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do XRF afterglows.
Moreover, the overall luminosity of XRF X-ray afterglows is systematically
smaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of C-GRBs. These distinct
differences between the X-ray afterglows of XRFs and C-GRBs may be the key to
