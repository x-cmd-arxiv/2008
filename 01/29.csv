terms of partonic calculations with a matching scale. This framework is called
GenEvA, and a key ingredient is a new notion of phase space which avoids the
problem of phase space double-counting by construction and includes a built-in
definition of a matching scale. This matching scale can be used to smoothly
merge any partonic calculation with a parton shower. The best partonic
calculation for a given region of phase space can be determined through physics
considerations alone, independent of the algorithmic details of the merging. As
an explicit example, we construct a positive-weight partonic calculation for
e+e- -> n jets at next-to-leading order (NLO) with leading-logarithmic (LL)
resummation. We improve on the NLO/LL result by adding additional
higher-multiplicity tree-level (LO) calculations to obtain a merged NLO/LO/LL
result. These results are implemented using a new phase space generator
introduced in a companion paper [arXiv:0801.4028].

In particular, the logarithmic running of the Lee-Wick vector boson mass is
exactly related to the running of the coupling. In the case of an
asymptotically free theory, the vector boson mass runs to infinity in the
ultraviolet. Thus, the UV fixed point of the pure gauge theory is an ordinary
quantum field theory. We find that the coupling runs more quickly in Lee-Wick

not naturally unify at any scale. Finally, we present results on the beta

identical other than their initial gas density distributions: one is
initialized with a standard hot gas halo that traces the cuspy profile of the
dark matter, and the other is initialized with a cored hot halo with a high
central entropy, as might be expected in models with early pre-heating
feedback. Galaxy formation proceeds in dramatically different fashions in these
two cases. While the standard cuspy halo cools rapidly, primarily from the
central region, the cored halo is quasi-stable for ~4 Gyr and eventually cools
via the fragmentation and infall of clouds from ~100 kpc distances. After 10
Gyr of cooling, the standard halo's X-ray luminosity is ~100 times current
limits and the resultant disk galaxy is twice as massive as the Milky Way. In
contrast, the cored halo has an X-ray luminosity that is in line with
observations, an extended cloud population reminiscent of the high-velocity
cloud population of the Milky Way, and a disk galaxy with half the mass and
~50% more specific angular momentum than the disk formed in the low-entropy

Bayesian evidence-based approach to the search for gravitational waves, in
particular aimed at the followup of candidate events generated by the analysis

evidence and odds ratio between different models, and illustrate this approach
using the specific case of the gravitational wave signal generated during the
inspiral phase of binary systems, modelled at the leading quadrupole Newtonian
order, in synthetic noise. We show that the method is effective in detecting
signals at the detection threshold and it is robust against (some types of)
instrumental artefacts. The computational efficiency of this method makes it
scalable to the analysis of all the triggers generated by the analysis
pipelines to search for coalescing binaries in surveys with ground-based
interferometers, and to a whole variety of signal waveforms, characterised by a
larger number of parameters.

absorptions observed along lines of sight to quasars separated by arcmin
distances in projection on the sky. We use cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations to compare the topologies of different fields: dark matter, gas and
neutral hydrogen optical depth and to investigate how well the topology of the
IGM can be recovered from the Wiener interpolation method implemented by Pichon
et al. (2001). The global statistical and topological properties of the
recovered field are analyzed quantitatively through the power-spectrum, the
probability distribution function (PDF), the Euler characteristics, its
associated critical point counts and the filling factor of underdense regions.
The local geometrical properties of the field are analysed using the local
skeleton by defining the concept of inter-skeleton distance. At scales larger
than ~1.4 <d_LOS>, where <d_LOS> is the mean separation between lines of sight,
the reconstruction accurately recovers the topological features of the large
scale density distribution of the gas, in particular the filamentary
structures. At scales larger than the intrinsic smoothing length of the
inversion procedure, the power spectrum of the recovered HI density field
matches well that of the original one and the low order moments of the PDF are
well recovered as well as the shape of the Euler characteristic. The integral
errors on the PDF and the critical point counts are indeed small, less than 20%
for <d_LOS>~2.5 arcmin. The small deviations between the reconstruction and the
exact solution mainly reflect departures from the log-normal behaviour that are
ascribed to highly non-linear objects in overdense regions.

seldom interested in production. Several economists discussed the concept of a
firm, as opposed to an open labour market where entrepreneurs would recrute
workers on the occasion of each business opportunity. Coase \cite{Coase} is one
of them, who explains the existence of firms as institution because they reduce
the transaction costs with respect to an open labour market. Whatever the
rationale proposed by economists to account for the existence of firms, their
perspective is based on efficiency and cost analysis. Little attention is paid
to the dynamics of emergence and evolution of firms. The aim of the present
manuscript is to check the global dynamical properties of a very simple model
based on bounded rationality and reinforcement learning.
  Workers and managers are localised on a lattice and they choose collaborators
on the basis of the success of previous work relations. The choice algorithm is
largely inspired rom the observation and modeling of long term customer/sellers
relationships observed on perishable goods markets discussed in Weisbuch
etal\cite{Weisbuch} and Nadal etal\cite{Nadal}. The model presented here is in
no way an alternative to Coase. We describe the build-up of long term
relationships which do reduce transaction costs, and we deduce the dynamical
properties of networks built from our simple assumptions.
  In conclusion, the present model explains the metastability of employment
relations in the firm, but something has to be added to it to explain the more
efficient workload repartition observed in real firms.

simultaneous soft and hard-X ray data of Seyfert galaxies. From this database
all the Seyfert galaxies (105 objects of which 43 are type I and 62 are type

homogeneous way (Dadina 2007). The X-ray data so collected allow to infer the
average spectral properties of nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the original
sample and, most notably: the photon index ($\Gamma$$\sim$1.8), the high-energy
cut-off (Ec$\sim$290 keV), and the relative amount of reflection (R$\sim$1.0).
The data have been also used to test some assumptions of the unified scheme for
the AGN. The distributions of the isotropic indicators (photon index, relative
amount of reflection, high-energy cut-off and narrow FeK$\alpha$ energy
centroid) are similar in type I and type II objects while the absorbing column
and the iron line equivalent width significantly differ between the two classes
of active galactic nuclei. Confirming previous results, the narrow FeK$\alpha$
line is consistent, in Seyfert 2, with being produced in the same matter

effect in Seyfert 1 has been here measured using the 20-100 keV luminosity
(EW$\propto$L(20-100)$^{-0.22\pm0.05}$). Finally, the possible presence of a
correlation between the photon index and the amount of reflection is confirmed
thus indicating thermal Comptonization as the most likely origin of the high
energy emission for the active galactic nuclei included in the original sample.

specific conditions, the existence of localization which is responsible for a
passive irreversible energy transfer from the linear oscillator to the
nonlinear one. The dissipative effect of the nonlinearity appears to play an
important role in the energy transfer phenomenon and some design criteria can
be drawn regarding this parameter among others to optimize this energy
transfer. The free transient response is investigated and it is shown that the
energy transfer appears when the energy input is sufficient in accordance with
the predictions from the nonlinear modes. Finally, the steady-state forced

Such schemes are however either complex in use or additional simplifications

localized orbitals onto a restricted set of Kohn-Sham states to define the

crystal-field splitting, which lifts the orbital degeneracy as well as an
inter-orbital hopping (inter-band hybridization). Both terms are relevant to
the realistic description of correlated materials such as transition-metal
oxides. The nature of the Mott metal-insulator transition is clarified and is
found to depend on the magnitude of the crystal-field splitting. At large
values of the splitting, a transition from a two-band to a one-band metal is
first found as the on-site repulsion is increased and is followed by a Mott
transition for the remaining band, which follows the single-band
(Brinkman-Rice) scenario well documented previously within dynamical mean-field
theory. At small values of the crystal-field splitting, a direct transition
from a two-band metal to a Mott insulator with partial orbital polarization is
found, which takes place simultaneously for both orbitals. This transition is
characterized by a vanishing of the quasiparticle weight for the majority
orbital but has a first-order character for the minority orbital. It is pointed
out that finite-temperature effects may easily turn the metallic regime into a
bad metal close to the orbital polarization transition in the metallic phase.

the impossibility of accommodating simultaneously the bottom mass and the BR(B

gamma amplitude have like sign with respect to the Standard Model one, as

unification to b - tau Yukawa unification. We find that with small departures
from the condition tan beta ~= 50, holding when Yukawa unification is exact,
the mentioned tension is substantially relieved. We emphasize that in the
region where fits are successful the lightest part of the SUSY spectrum is
basically fixed by the requirements of b - tau unification and the applied FCNC

mechanisms in order to explain the entire range of giant planets found in
extrasolar planetary systems. Disk instability is based on the formation of
clumps in a marginally-gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk. These
clumps can only be expected to contract and survive to become protoplanets if
they are able to lose thermal energy through a combination of convection and
radiative cooling. Here we present several new three dimensional, radiative
hydrodynamics models of self-gravitating protoplanetary disks, where radiative
transfer is handled in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. We show that
while the flux-limited models lead to higher midplane temperatures than in a
diffusion approximation model without the flux-limiter, the difference in
temperatures does not appear to be sufficiently high to have any significant
effect on the formation of self-gravitating clumps. Self-gravitating clumps
form rapidly in the models both with and without the flux-limiter. These models
suggest that the reason for the different outcomes of numerical models of disk
instability by different groups cannot be attributed solely to the handling of
radiative transfer, but rather appears to be caused by a range of numerical
effects and assumptions. Given the observational imperative to have disk
instability form at least some extrasolar planets, these models imply that disk
instability remains as a viable giant planet formation mechanism.

electrically neutral and lightly ionized plasma composed of three moving
particle species: neutrons, protons, and electrons, which can be converted into
each other by weak interactions (beta decays), suffer binary collisions, and be
affected by each other's macroscopic electromagnetic fields. Since the
evolution of the magnetic field occurs over thousands of years or more,
compared to dynamical time scales (sound and Alfv\'en) of milliseconds to
seconds, we use a slow-motion approximation in which we neglect the inertial
terms in the equations of motion for the particles. We restrict ourselves to a
one-dimensional geometry in which the magnetic field points in one Cartesian
direction but varies only along an orthogonal direction. We study the evolution
of the system in three different ways: (i) estimating time scales directly from
the equations, guided by physical intuition; (ii) a normal-mode analysis in the
limit of a nearly uniform system; and (iii) a finite-difference numerical
integration of the equations of motion. We find good agreement between our
analytical normal-mode solutions and the numerical simulations. We show that
the magnetic field and the particles evolve through successive
quasi-equilibrium states, on time scales that can be understood by physical
arguments. Depending of the parameter values the magnetic field can evolve by
ohmic diffusion or by ambipolar diffusion, the latter being limited either by
interparticle collisions or by relaxation to chemical equilibrium through beta
decays. The numerical simulations are further validated by verifying that they
satisfy the known conservation laws also in highly non-linear situations.

Very metal poor stars lose very little mass and angular momentum during the
main sequence evolution, and rotation plays a dominant role in their evolution.
In rapidly rotating massive stars, the rotationally induced mixing time scale
can be even shorter than the nuclear time scale throughout the main sequence.
The consequent quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution greatly differs from the
standard massive star evolution that leads to formation of red giants with
strong chemical stratification. Interesting outcomes of such a new mode of
evolution include the formation of rapidly rotating massive Wolf-Rayet stars
that emit large amounts of ionizing photons, the formation of a long gamma-ray
bursts and a hypernovae, and the production of large amounts of primary
nitrogen. We show that binary interactions can further enhance the effects of
rotation, as mass accretion in a close binary spins up the secondary.

independent of the redshift range, the optical and radio flux selection limits,
or the exact definition of a radio match. We also find that at fixed optical
magnitude, the highest bins of radio luminosity are preferentially populated by
non-BALQSOs, consistent with the overall trend. We do find, however, that those
quasars identified as AI-BALQSOs but \emph{not} under the classical definition,
do not show a significant drop in their fraction as a function of radio power,
further supporting independent claims for which these sources, characterized by
lower equivalent width, may represent an independent class with respect to the

X-ray luminosity function evolution separately for early and late-type systems.
  METHODS: We selected 207 normal galaxies up to redshift z~1.4, with data from
four major Chandra X-ray surveys, namely the Chandra deep fields (north, south
and extended) and XBootes, and a combination of X-ray and optical criteria. We
used template spectral energy-distribution fitting to obtain separate early-

the full sample, as well as the two sub-samples, we obtained luminosity
functions using both a non-parametric and a parametric, maximum-likelihood
method.
  RESULTS: For the full sample, the non-parametric method strongly suggests
luminosity evolution with redshift. The maximum-likelihood estimate shows that
this evolution follows ~(1+z)^k_total, k_total=2.2+-0.3. For the late-type
sub-sample, we obtained k_late=2.4^+1.0_-2.0. We detected no significant

late-type systems with redshift show that late types dominate at z>~0.5 and

characteristics: (a) X-ray selection using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, since
x-rays are a ubiquitous feature of AGNs; (b) Emphasis on late-type spiral and
dwarf galaxies, as the galaxies most likely to have low-mass SMBHs; (c) Use of
multiwavelength data to verify the source is an AGN; and (d) Use of the highest
angular resolution available for observations in x-rays and other bands, to
separate nuclear from off-nuclear sources and to minimize contamination by host
galaxy light. Here we show the feasibility of this technique to find AGNs by
applying it to six nearby, face-on spiral galaxies (NGC 3169, NGC 3184, NGC
4102, NGC 4647, NGC 4713, NGC 5457) for which data already exist in the Chandra

are ambiguous regarding the nature of the nuclear x-ray sources in NGC 4713 and
NGC 4647. We conclude, in accord with previous studies, that NGC 3169 and NGC
4102 are almost certainly AGNs. Most interestingly, a strong argument can be
made that NGC 3184 and NGC 5457, both of type Scd, host AGNs.

(electro-positron) jets show that acceleration occurs within the downstream
jet. Shock acceleration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical plasmas.
Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., the Buneman instability,
other two-streaming instability, and the Weibel instability) created in the
shocks are responsible for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration.
The simulation results show that the Weibel instability is responsible for
generating and amplifying highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields. These
magnetic fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the
jet head. The ``jitter'' radiation from deflected electrons has different
properties than synchrotron radiation which assumes a uniform magnetic field.
This jitter radiation may be important to understanding the complex time
evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, and
supernova remnants.

two-dimensional projectile motion to find the minimum velocity a tiger needs in

  Software available from http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~brewer/",,,,"stat.AP physics.data-an",,"  A Bayesian Survival Analysis method is motivated and developed for analysing
sequences of scores made by a batsman in test or first class cricket. In
particular, we expect the presence of an effect whereby the distribution of
scores has more probability near zero than a geometric distribution, due to the
fact that batting is more difficult when the batsman is new at the crease. A
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is found to be efficient at estimating the
proposed parameters, allowing us to quantify exactly how large this
early-innings effect is, and how long a batsman needs to be at the crease in
order to ``get their eye in''. Applying this model to several modern players
shows that a batsman is typically only playing at about half of their potential
ability when they first arrive at the crease, and gets their eye in
surprisingly quickly. Additionally, some players are more ``robust'' (have a
smaller early-innings effect) than others, which may have implications for
selection policy.

a series of different media with different refractive indices $n_{i}(\omega)$
and lengths $d_{i}$ can be equivalent to an effective medium with the
volume-averaged refractive index $\frac{1}{D}\sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}(\omega)d_{i}$
and the total length $D=\sum_{i=1i}^{N}d_{i}$,where $N$ is the number of
different media. Based on this equivalent theory, it is a simple but very
useful method to design the effective medium with any desirable dispersion
properties. As an example, we present a proposal to obtain the enhancement or
reduction of the refractive index without absorption and the large dispersion
without obvious absorption by assembling different linear dispersive gain and
absorptive media.

torque with respect to the situation where neither the planet nor the disk
feels the disk gravity. This enhancement only depends on the Toomre parameter
at the planet location. It is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the
spurious one induced by assuming a planet migrating in a disk without

can be entirely accounted for by a shift of Lindblad resonances, and can be
reproduced by the use of an anisotropic pressure tensor. We do not find any

increasing scrutiny because of their potential for modern energy technologies.
While traditional \emph{ab initio} methods such as the LDA give accurate
geometries for graphite they are poorer at predicting physicial properties such
as cohesive energies and elastic constants perpendicular to the layers because
of the strong dependence on long-range dispersion forces. `Stretching' the
layers via pillars or intercalation further highlights these weaknesses. We use
the ideas developed by [J. F. Dobson et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 073201

of the cohesive energy on layer spacing $D$ in bigraphene is universal to all
graphitic systems with evenly spaced layers. At spacings appropriate to
intercalates, this differs from and begins to dominate the $C_4 D^{-4}$ power
law for dispersion that has been widely used previously. The corrected power
law (and a calculated $C_3$ coefficient) is then unsuccesfully employed in the

interstellar clouds, and hence, the direct evaporation of CO2 from dust grain
is unrealistic as a source of gaseous CO2 in L1527. A narrow line width of
HCO2+ also supports this. On the other hand, the fractional abundance of CO2 is
estimated to be 2.9x10^-7, if the source size is comparable to the beam size.
These results indicate that gaseous CO2 is abundant even in the low-mass
star-forming region. Possible production mechanisms of gaseous CO2 are

the behavior of the resistivity of the spin current calculated as a function of

  supermassive black hole paradigm","4 pages, 3 figures; accepted for publication by Astronomy &
  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200809391",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: Hyper-velocity stars move so fast that only a supermassive black
hole (SMBH) seems to be capable to accelerate them. Hence the Galactic centre
(GC) is their only suggested place of origin. Edelmann et al. (2005) found the
early B-star HE0437-5439 to be too short-lived to have reached its current
position in the Galactic halo if ejected from the GC, except if being a blue
straggler. Its proximity to the LMC suggested an origin from this galaxy. Aims:
The chemical signatures of stars at the GC are significantly different from
those in the LMC. Hence, an accurate measurement of the abundance pattern of
HE0437-5439 will yield a new tight constraint on the place of birth of this
star. Methods: High-resolution spectra obtained with UVES on the VLT are
analysed using state-of-the-art non-LTE modelling techniques. Results: We
measured abundances of individual elements to very high accuracy in HE0437-5439
as well as in two reference stars, from the LMC and the solar neighbourhood.
The abundance pattern is not consistent at all with that observed in stars near
the GC, ruling our an origin from the GC. However, there is a high degree of
consistency with the LMC abundance pattern. Our abundance results cannot rule
out an origin in the outskirts of the Galactic disk. However, we find the life
time of HE0437-5439 to be more than 3 times shorter than the time of flight to
the edge of the disk, rendering a Galactic origin unlikely. Conclusions: Only
one SMBH is known to be present in Galaxy and none in the LMC. Hence the
exclusion of an GC origin challenges the SMBH paradigm. We conclude that there
must be other mechanism(s) to accelerate stars to hyper-velocity speed than the
SMBH. We draw attention to dynamical ejection from dense massive clusters, that
has recently been proposed by Gvaramadze et al. (2008).

both from the gravity side and the dual field theory side. For the latter we
argue that there should be two different, but equivalent, dual gauge theory

Longitude range is from 75 to 198 degrees. Some of the sources are associated
with well-known Lynds Nebulae and HII compact regions in the galactic plane. A
large fraction of the sources have an IRAS counterpart. Except for Jupiter,
Saturn, the Crab and Cas A, all sources show a dust-emission-like modified

coldest sources (T<10 K), a steep nu^beta emissivity law is found with a
surprising beta ~ 3 to 4. An inverse relationship between T and beta is
observed. The number density of sources at 353 GHz with flux brighter than 100

provide a strong check for the calibration of the Planck HFI focal plane
geometry as a complement to planets. These very cold sources observed by

nuclei, in connection with a recent FINUDA experiment which claims the
existence of a deeply bound kaonic state from the observation of a peak in the
Lambda d invariant mass distribution following K- absorption on Li6. We show
that the peak is naturally explained in terms of K- absorption from three
nucleons leaving the rest as spectators. We can also reproduce all the other
observables measured in the same experiment and used to support the hypothesis
of the deeply bound kaon state. Our study also reveals interesting aspects of
kaon absorption in nuclei, a process that must be understood in order to make
progress in the search for K- deeply bound states in nuclei.

of the hot-spot model for the radio variability of Sgr A*. It is possible to
rule out hot spots with orbital radii above 15GM_SgrA*/c^2 that contribute more
than 30% of the total 7-mm flux. However, closer or less luminous hot spots
remain unconstrained. Since the fractional variability of Sgr A* during our

radio variability remains consistent with these limits. Improved monitoring of
Sgr A*'s centroid position has the potential to place significant constraints
upon the existence and morphology of inhomogeneities in a supermassive black

clusters by two main formation channels: i) mergers induced by stellar
collisions and ii) coalescence or mass-transfer between companions in binary
systems. The detailed study of the BSS properties is therefore crucial for
understanding the binary evolution mechanisms, and the complex interplay
between dynamics and stellar evolution in dense stellar systems. Aims. We
present the first comparison between the BSS specific frequency and the binary
fraction in the core of a sample of Galactic globular clusters, with the aim of
investigating the relative efficiency of the two proposed formation mechanisms.
Methods. We derived the frequency of BSSs in the core of thirteen low-density
Galactic globular clusters by using deep ACS@HST observations and investigated
its correlation with the binary fraction and various other cluster parameters.
Results. We observed a correlation between the BSS specific frequency and the
binary fraction. The significance of the correlation increases by including a
further dependence on the cluster central velocity dispersion. Conclusions. We
conclude that the unperturbed evolution of primordial binaries could be the
dominant BSS formation process, at least in low-density environments.

Double differential cross sections for light charged particles (LCP) were
analyzed in the frame of the microscopic model of intranuclear cascade (INC)
with coalescence of nucleons and statistical model for evaporation of particles
from excited residual nuclei. Energy and angular dependencies of data agree
satisfactorily neither with predictions of microscopic intranuclear cascade
calculations for protons, nor with coalescence calculations for other LCP.
Phenomenological inclusion of another reaction mechanism - emission of LCP from
a ""fireball"", i.e., fast and hot moving source - combined with the microscopic
model calculations of INC, coalescence and evaporation of particles leads to
very good description of the data. It was found that nonequilibrium processes
are very important for production of LCP. They exhaust 40-80% of the total
cross sections - depending on the emitted particles. Coalescence and ""fireball""
emission give comparable contributions to the cross sections with exception of
3He data where coalescence clearly dominates. The ratio of sum of all

that undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on
the application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem for calculating the degree
of transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third
generation light sources, because the vertical(geometrical) emittance of the
electron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength
in a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from
0.1 Angstrom up to 10^3 Angstrom). Sometimes, the so-called Gaussian-Schell
model, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description of
partially-coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to the
quasi-homogeneous model. However, as we will demonstrate, this model fails to
properly describe coherent properties of X-ray beams from non-homogeneous
undulator sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. We
propose a technique, based on statistical optics and Fourier optics, to
explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in the
most general case, at any position after the undulator. Our theory, that makes
consistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment and
physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with
their region of applicability. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic
situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation
wavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. This case is practically
relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.

of this work is to understand under which circumstances large events are better
predictable than smaller events. Therefore we use a simple prediction algorithm
based on precursory structures which are identified using the maximum
likelihood principle. Using the receiver operator characteristic curve as a
measure for the quality of predictions we find that the dependence on the event
magnitude is closely linked to the probability distribution function of the
underlying stochastic process. We evaluate this dependence on the probability
distribution function analytically and numerically. If we assume that the
optimal precursory structures are used to make the predictions, we find that
large increments are better predictable if the underlying stochastic process
has a Gaussian probability distribution function, whereas larger increments are
harder to predict if the underlying probability distribution function has a
power law tail. In the case of an exponential distribution function we find no
significant dependence on the event magnitude. Furthermore we compare these
results with predictions of increments in correlated data, namely, velocity
increments of a free jet flow. The velocity increments in the free jet flow are
in dependence on the time scale either asymptotically Gaussian or
asymptotically exponential distributed. The numerical results for predictions
within free jet data are in good agreement with the previous analytical
considerations for random numbers.
