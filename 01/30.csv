Here we illustrate that the simplest models that embody the orbital degrees of
freedom - the two- and three-dimensional quantum orbital compass models -
exhibit an exact quantum critical behavior on diluted square and cubic lattices
(with a doping fraction of 1/4 and 1/2 respectively). This raises the
possibility of quantum critical points triggered by the degradation of orbital
order upon doping (or applying pressure to) such transition metal systems. We
prove the existence of an orbital spin glass in several related systems in
which the orbital couplings are made non-uniform. Moreover, a new orbital
Larmor precession (i.e., a periodic change in the orbital state) is predicted
when uniaxial pressure is applied.

photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey yields an 8-passband lightcurve,
from which we derive an orbital period of 2.6390157 +/- 0.0000016 days.
Spectroscopic followup confirms our photometric classification of the system,
which is likely composed of M0 and M1 dwarfs. Radial velocity measurements
allow us to derive the masses (M_1 = 0.66 +/- 0.03 M_sun; M_2 = 0.62 +/- 0.03

low-mass stars in binary systems. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the
lightcurves which allow us to uncover complicated degeneracies between the
system parameters. Both stars show evidence of H-alpha emission, something not
common in early-type M dwarfs. This suggests that binarity may influence the
magnetic activity properties of low-mass stars; activity in the binary may
persist long after the dynamos in their isolated counterparts have decayed,
yielding a new potential foreground of flaring activity for next generation

angular distribution of the UHECR intensity. We define a statistic, that
measures the correlation between the predicted and observed UHECR arrival
direction distributions, and show that it is more sensitive to the expected
anisotropy signature than the power spectrum and the two point correlation
function. The distribution of the correlation statistic is not sensitive to the
unknown redshift evolution of UHECR source density and to the unknown strength
and structure of inter-galactic magnetic fields. We show, using this statistic,
that recently published >5.7x10^{19} eV Auger data are inconsistent with
isotropy at ~98% CL, and consistent with a source distribution that traces LSS,
with some preference to a source distribution that is biased with respect to
the galaxy distribution. The anisotropy signature should be detectable also at
lower energy, >4x10^{19} eV. A few fold increase of the Auger exposure is
likely to increase the significance to >99% CL, but not to >99.9% CL (unless
the UHECR source density is comparable or larger than that of galaxies). In
order to distinguish between different bias models, the systematic uncertainty
in the absolute energy calibration of the experiments should be reduced to well
below the current ~25%.

results for the very low mass-ratio close binary AW UMa which strongly indicate
that the spectroscopic mass ratio (q_sp = 0.10) does not agree with the
photometrically derived one and that the widely adopted contact binary model
appears to experience serious inconsistencies and limitations for this object.
AW UMa is compared with V566 Oph (q_sp = 0.26) which we found to behave
according to the contact model. Observed broadening functions of AW UMa can be
interpreted by a very strong limb darkening and/or non-solid body rotation of
the dominant primary component; the former assumption is unphysical while the
differential rotation is not supported by an apparent stability of localized,
dark features on the outer side of the primary. There are indications of the
existence of an equatorial belt encompassing the whole system. All deficiencies
in the interpretation and the discrepancy between the photometric and
spectroscopic mass ratio of AW UMa can be solved within a new model of AW UMa
where both components are detached and the system is submerged in a stream of
hot, optically thick matter which mimics the stellar contact. While the masses
and their ratio are correctly given by spectroscopy, the photometric picture is
heavily modified by the matter engulfing both stars in the equatorial plane.

Korner's Maximum Mutual Information decoder with erasure option for discrete

that is designed to optimize the fundamental tradeoff between undetected-error
and erasure exponents for a compound class of channels. The class of weighting
functions may be further enlarged to optimize a similar tradeoff for list
decoders -- in that case, undetected-error probability is replaced with average
number of incorrect messages in the list. Explicit solutions are identified.
  The optimal exponents admit simple expressions in terms of the sphere-packing
exponent, at all rates below capacity. For small erasure exponents, these
expressions coincide with those derived by Forney (1968) for symmetric
channels, using Maximum a Posteriori decoding. Thus for those channels at
least, ignorance of the channel law is inconsequential. Conditions for
optimality of the Csiszar-Korner rule and of the simpler

transverse momentum (0.4 < pT < 10 GeV/c) and centrality (0-92%) selections for
charged hadrons from di-jets in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. With
increasing pT, the away-side Delta phi distribution evolves from a broad and
relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons
to p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a
partially suppressed head region centered at Delta phi ~ \pi, and an enhanced
shoulder region centered at Delta phi ~ \pi \pm 1:1. The pT spectrum for the
associated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The
spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger
pT . The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative
to those in p + p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in
Delta phi and Delta eta, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However,
these modifications seem to be limited to pT < 4 GeV/c, above which both the
dihadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p + p collisions.
These observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions
contain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT \ge 5GeV and a
medium-induced component which is important for pT \le 4 GeV/c. We also
quantify the role of jets at intermediate and low pT through the yield of
jet-induced pairs in comparison to binary scaled p + p pair yield. The yield of
jet-induced pairs is suppressed at high pair proxy energy (sum of the pT
magnitudes of the two hadrons) and is enhanced at low pair proxy energy. The
former is consistent with jet quenching; the latter is consistent with the
enhancement of soft hadron pairs due to transport of lost energy to lower pT.

the star, then gamma-rays are absorbed in the stellar photon field, creating
secondary (electron-positron) pairs. We study the broadband emission of these
secondary pairs in the stellar photon and magnetic fields. Under certain
assumptions on the stellar wind and the magnetic field in the surroundings of a
massive hot star, we calculate the steady state energy distribution of
secondary pairs created in the system and its radiation from radio to
gamma-rays. Under the ambient magnetic field, possibly high enough to suppress
electromagnetic (EM) cascading, the energy of secondary pairs is radiated via
synchrotron and single IC scattering producing radio-to-gamma-ray radiation.
The synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) is hard, peaks around X-ray
energies, and becomes softer. The IC SED is hard as well and peaks around 10
GeV, becoming also softer at higher energies due to synchrotron loss dominance.
The radio emission from secondary pairs is moderate and detectable as a
point-like and/or extended source. In X-rays, the secondary pair synchrotron
component may be dominant. At energies <10 GeV, the secondary pair IC radiation
may be the dominant primary gamma-ray emission and possibly detectable by the
next generation of instruments.

Kauffman proposed them in the 1960's as models for gene regulatory networks.
These systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and
by simultaneous updating at discrete time steps. Of particular importance for
biological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is
bounded by a fixed constant, as was stressed by Kauffman in his original
papers.
  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule
out exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper we consider
cooperative systems, i.e. systems with positive feedback interconnections among
all variables, which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics.
In Part I of this paper we presented a construction that shows that for an
arbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently large n there exist n-dimensional
Boolean cooperative networks in which both the indegree and outdegree of each
for each variable is bounded by two (bi-quadratic networks) and which
nevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n.
  In this part, we prove an inverse result showing that for sufficiently large
n and for 0<c<2 sufficiently close to 2, any n-dimensional cooperative,
bi-quadratic Boolean network with a cycle of length at least c^n must have a
large proportion of variables with indegree 1. Such systems therefore share a
structural similarity to the systems constructed in Part I.

known MBH-host galaxy scaling relations, while the accretion rate onto the MBH
larger than the average value appropriate to Seyfert 1 galaxies. In this

inclination angles from the fraction of Seyfert 1 classified as NLS1s, and
compute the geometrical factor relating the observed FWHM of broad lines to the

for the ""black hole mass deficit"" observed in NLS1s, and that L/L_Edd is (on
average) comparable to the value of the more common broad line Seyfert 1

expect that a next generation photometric redshift survey could constrain the
number of neutrinos N_nu and the sum of their masses m_nu to an accuracy of
dN_nu ~ 0.08 and dm_nu ~ 0.03 eV respectively. If in fact the masses are close
to zero, then the errors weaken to dN_nu ~ 0.10 and dm_nu~0.07 eV. In either
case there is a factor 4 improvement over Planck alone. We use a Bayesian
evidence method to predict joint expected evidence for N_nu and m_nu. We find
that 3D cosmic shear combined with a Planck prior could provide `substantial'
evidence for massive neutrinos and be able to distinguish `decisively' between
many competing massive neutrino models. This technique should `decisively'
distinguish between models in which there are no massive neutrinos and models

promising sky regions with respect to on-going and future searches.
  Methods: Applying a population synthesis model the inhomogeneity of the

be most abundant in the directions of rich OB associations. New candidates are
expected to be identified behind the Gould Belt, in particular in the

important to understand that dark matter halo mergers are not galaxy mergers; a
theory of galaxy formation is necessary to connect the two. Mergers of galaxies
in hydrodynamical simulations show a stronger dependence on mass than halo
mergers in N-body simulations. If one knows how to connect galaxies to dark

rotating background threaded by a vertical magnetic field when disturbances
with wavenumbers perpendicular to the shear are considered. We provide a
geometrical description of these viscous, resistive MRI modes and show how
their physical structure is modified as a function of the Reynolds and magnetic
Reynolds numbers. We demonstrate that when finite dissipative effects are
considered, velocity and magnetic field disturbances are no longer orthogonal
(as it is the case in the ideal MHD limit) unless the magnetic Prandtl number
is unity. We generalize previous results found in the ideal limit and show that
a series of key properties of the mean Reynolds and Maxwell stresses also hold
for the viscous, resistive MRI. In particular, we show that the Reynolds stress
is always positive and the Maxwell stress is always negative. Therefore, even
in the presence of viscosity and resistivity, the total mean angular momentum
transport is always directed outwards. We also find that, for any combination
of the Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers, magnetic disturbances dominate
both the energetics and the transport of angular momentum and that the total
mean energy density is an upper bound for the total mean stress responsible for
angular momentum transport. The ratios between the Maxwell and Reynolds
stresses and between magnetic and kinetic energy densities increase with
decreasing Reynolds numbers for any magnetic Reynolds number; the lowest limit
of both ratios is reached in the ideal MHD regime.

are known as DQ WDs. The subclass of peculiar DQ WDs are cool objects
(T_eff<6000 K) which show molecular absorption bands that have centroid
wavelengths ~100-300 Angstroms shortward of the bandheads of the C_2 Swan
bands. These ""peculiar DQ bands"" have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as
C_2H. We point out that C_2H does not show strong absorption bands with
wavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands and neither does any other
simple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD atmosphere. The most
straightforward explanation for the peculiar DQ bands is that they are
pressure-shifted Swan bands of C_2. While current models of WD atmospheres
suggest that, in general, peculiar DQ WDs do not have higher photospheric
pressures than normal DQ WDs do, that finding requires confirmation by improved
models of WD atmospheres and of the behavior of C_2 at high pressures and
temperatures. If it is eventually shown that the peculiar DQ bands cannot be
explained as pressure-shifted Swan bands, the only explanation remaining would
seem to be that they arise from highly rotationally excited C_2 (J_peak>45). In
either case, the absorption band profiles can in principle be used to constrain
the pressure and the rotational temperature of C_2 in the line-forming regions
of normal and peculiar DQ WD atmospheres, which will be useful for comparison
with models. Finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic DQ WDs
may require models which simultaneously consider magnetic fields, high
pressures and rotational excitation of C_2.

decrease with higher transmission power under different scenarios. In this

following questions: (1)Theoretically, should we increase or decrease
transmission power to maximize network capacity? (2) Theoretically, how much
network capacity gain can we achieve by power control? (3) Under realistic
situations, how do power control, link scheduling and routing interact with
each other? Under which scenarios can we expect a large capacity gain by using
higher transmission power? To answer these questions, firstly, we prove that
the optimal network capacity is a non-decreasing function of transmission
power. Secondly, we prove that the optimal network capacity can be increased
unlimitedly by higher transmission power in some network configurations.
However, when nodes are distributed uniformly, the gain of optimal network
capacity by higher transmission power is upper-bounded by a positive constant.
Thirdly, we discuss why network capacity in practice may increase or decrease
with higher transmission power under different scenarios using carrier sensing
and the minimum hop-count routing. Extensive simulations are carried out to
verify our analysis.

VLA-D 3.6-cm continuum, ground-based, and HST-archive imaging as well as long
slit high- and low-dispersion spectroscopy. The low-dispersion spectra indicate
a high excitation nebula, with low to medium variations of its internal
physical conditions. In the optical images, the point-symmetric knots show a
lack of [NII] emission as compared with similar features previously known in
other PNe. A rich internal structure of the central region is seen in the HST
images, resembling a deformed torus. Long slit high-dispersion spectra reveal a
complex kinematics in the central region. The spectral line profiles from the
external regions of NGC 6309 indicate expanding lobes (~40 km/s) as those
generally found in bipolar nebulae. Finally, we have found evidence for the
presence of a faint halo, possibly related to the envelope of the AGB-star
progenitor. Our data indicate that NGC 6309 is a quadrupolar nebula with two
pairs of bipolar lobes whose axes are oriented PA=40 and PA=76. Equatorial and
polar velocities for these two pairs of lobes are 29 and 86 km/s for the
bipolar system at PA=40 and 25 and 75 km/s for the bipolar system at PA=76.
There is also a central torus that is expanding at 25 km/s. Kinematical age for
all these structures is around 3700 to 4000 yr. We conclude that NGC 6309 was
formed by a set of well-collimated bipolar outflows (jets), which were ejected
in the initial stages of its formation as a planetary nebula. These jets carved
the bipolar lobes in the previous AGB wind and their remnants are now observed
as the point-symmetric knots tracing the edges of the lobes.

properties of their central stars. Nebulosities are detected in 15 of 33
sources. Images and photometric and geometric measurements are presented. For
sources with nebulosities we see a morphological bifurcation into two groups,
DUPLEX and SOLE, as previous studies have found. We find further support to the
previous results suggesting that this dichotomy is caused by a difference in
optical thickness of the dust shell. The remaining 18 sources are classified as
stellar post-AGB objects, because our observations indicate a lack of
nebulosity. We show that some stellar sources may in fact be DUPLEX or SOLE
based on their infrared colors. The cause of the differences among the groups
are investigated. We discuss some evidence suggesting that high progenitor-mass
AGB stars tend to become DUPLEX post-AGB objects. Intermediate progenitor-mass
AGB stars tend to be SOLE post-AGB objects. Most of the stellar sources
probably have low mass progenitors and do not seem to develop nebulosities
during the post-AGB phase and therefore do not become planetary nebulae.

taking into account the Compton scattering of soft photons from the thin disk
by hot thermal electrons and coronal irradiation heating of the thin disk,
which emits blackbody radiation. By adjusting the density parameter of the MHD
coronal flow, we can produce the emergent spectra which are consistent with
those of typical Seyfert galaxies. Moreover, we find rapid time variability in

rules used in the generally accepted microscopic theory. It is shown that the
phase phonon modes and the electric fields couple directly, with the coupling
constant proportional to the magnitude of the charge-density wave. The
single-particle contributions to the optical conductivity tensor are determined
for the ordered CDW state and the related weakly doped metallic state by means
of the Bethe--Salpeter equations for elementary electron-hole excitations. It
turns out that this gauge-invariant approach establishes a clear connection

consistent with the conductivity sum rules.

computed using a numerical code that fully takes the effects of rotation
(centrifugal distortion and Coriolis acceleration) into account. All low-degree
modes, l=0 to 3, with radial orders n=1-10 and 21-25 for N=3 polytropic models

spin wave mode appears. This mode is characterized by variations of the value
of the magnetic moment density. In order to analyse influence of the magnetic
disorder on spin wave dispersion relations, the special case of volume and
surface spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach (DE) geometry in films with magnetic
disorder is considered. It is revealed strong influence of the magnetic
disorder on surface spin waves, which consist of two branches -- the DE mode
and the longitudinal spin wave mode. Decrease of the ordering parameters leads
to a decrease of the initial frequency and the curve slope of the DE mode
dispersion curve and to an increase of the dispersion curve slope of the
longitudinal mode. If the spin noncollinearity is high, then the DE mode
dispersion assumes a curve with the backward character. It is found that the
dispersion relation of the longitudinal mode is weak temperature dependent. The

based on observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Scenarios based on the
unified model suggest that silicate emission in AGN arises mainly from the
illuminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.
However, detections of silicate emission in Type 2 QSOs, and the estimated cool
dust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.To investigate
this issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 QSOs. These spectra, and
especially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted using
dusty narrow line region (NLR) models and a combination of black bodies. The
bolometric luminosities of the QSOs allow us to derive the radial distances and
covering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. The inferred radii are 100-200
times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expected
dimensions of the inner torus. Our QSO mid-IR spectra are consistent with the
bulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost parts
of the NLR.

suggest that the standard (Eulerian) slow precession that results for weak drag
between the vortices and the charged fluid (protons and electrons) is not
seriously constrained by the existence of the instability. In contrast, the
fast precession, which results when vortices are strongly coupled to the
charged component, is generally unstable. This implies that fast precession may

edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4013. This arcing feature extends 6 arcmin (~26 kpc
in projected distance) northeast from the center and 3 arcmin (~=12 kpc) from
the disk plane; likely related features are also apparent on the southwest side
of the disk, extending to 4 arcmin (~17 kpc). The detection of this low
surface-brightness muR= 27.0+0.3-0.2 mag/sqarcsec) structure is independently
confirmed in three separate datasets from three different telescopes.
  Although its true three dimensional geometry is unknown, the sky- projected
morphology of this structure displays a match with the theoretical predictions
for the edge-on, projected view of a stellar tidal streams of a dwarf satellite
moving in a low inclined (~25deg), nearly circular orbit. Using the recent
model of the Monoceros tidal stream in the Milky Way by Penarrubia et al. as
template, we find that the progenitor system may have been a galaxy with an
initial mass 6*10^8 Msun, of which current position and final fate is unknown.
According to this simulation, the tidal stream may be approximately ~2.8 Gyr of
age.
  Our results demonstrate that NGC 4013, previously considered a prototypical
isolated disk galaxy in spite of having one of the most prominent HI warps
detected thus far, may have in fact suffered a recent minor merger. This
discovery highlights that undisturbed disks at high surface brightness levels

the far kinematic distance of 5 kpc for Hoffleit 18. For Trumpler 14 we derived

of $1.7\pm0.7$ Myr. The fraction of stars with infrared excess in Trumpler 14

  We prove that the kneading sequence completely encodes the Hubbard tree and

modifications of the surface. The details of the morphology of these
modifications depends strongly on the angle of incidence and can be
characterized by atomic force microscopy. At glancing angles, discontinuous
chains of nanosized hillocks appear on the surface. The latent track radius can
be determined from the variation of the length of the chains with the angle of
incidence. This radius is material specific and allows the calculation of the
electron-phonon-coupling constant for SrTiO$_3$. We show that a theoretical
description of the nanodot creation is possible within a two-temperature model
if the spatial electron density is taken into account. The appearance of
discontinuous features can be explained easily within this model, but it turns
out that the electronic excitation dissipates on a femtosecond time scale and
thus too rapidly to feed sufficient energy into the phonon system in order to
induce a thermal melting process. We demonstrate that this can be solved if the
temperature dependent diffusion coefficient is introduced into the model.

precursor of the Mott phase, grows as the QPT is approached and evolves into a
hole (particle) excitation in the Mott insulator depending on whether the
chemical potential is above (below) the tip of the lobe. The sound velocity of
the Goldstone modes remains finite when the transition is approached at a
constant density, otherwise, it vanishes at the transition. It agrees well with
Bogoliubov theory except close to the transition. We also calculate the spatial

alternating shells of Mott insulator and superfluid. Finally, we discuss the

highlight the mass distribution within the galactic halo. The general dark
matter density has a typical $r^{-3}$ power law for large radii, but the inner
behaviour is poorly constrained below the resolution of the simulation ($\sim
200$ pc). We identify clumps and subclumps and analyze their distribution, as
well as their internal structure. Inside the clumps, the power law is rather
universal, $r^{-2.5}$ in the outer part with again strong uncertainties for
smaller radii, especially for light clumps. We show a full-sky map of the
astrophysical contribution to the gamma-ray or neutrino fluxes in this N-body
framework. Using quite model independent and general assumptions for the high
energy physics part, we evaluate the possible absolute fluxes and show some
benchmark regions for the experiments GLAST, EGRET, and a km3 size extension of
ANTARES like the KM3NeT project. While individual clumps seem to be beyond
detection reach, the galactic center region is promising and GLAST could be
sensitive to the geometry and the structure of its dark matter distribution.
The detection by a km3 version of ANTARES is, however, more challenging due to
a higher energy threshold. We also point out that the lack of resolution leaves
the inner structure of subhalos poorly constrained. Using the same clump
spectrum and mass fraction, a clump luminosity boost of order ten can be
achieved with a steeper profile in the inner part of the sub-halos.

establishes the Compton thin nature for three sources in which a measure of the

this small sample is also confirmed by the diagnostic ratios F$x/F[OIII]. The
Compton reflection components we measure, reflection continuum and iron line,
are not immediately compatible with a scenario in which the absorbing and
reflecting media are one and the same, i.e. the obscuring torus. A possible
solution is that the absorption is more effective than reflection, e.g. under
the hypothesis that the absorbing/reflecting medium is not uniform, like a
clumpy torus, or that the source is observed through a torus with a very
shallow opening angle. The high energy cut-off (a lower limit in two cases) is
found in all sources of our sample and the range of values is in good agreement

spectral behaviour. X-ray spectra covering 0.2-10 keV and pulse profiles in
different energy bands were extracted from the EPIC data. The detection of 6.85
s pulsations in the EPIC-PN data unambiguously identifies the transient with
XTE J0103-728, discovered as 6.85 s pulsar by RXTE. The X-ray light curve
during the XMM-Newton observation shows flaring activity of the source with
intensity changes by a factor of two within 10 minutes. Modelling of
pulse-phase averaged spectra with a simple absorbed power-law indicates
systematic residuals which can be accounted for by a second emission component.
For models implying blackbody emission, thermal plasma emission or emission
from the accretion disk (disk-blackbody), the latter yields physically sensible
parameters. The photon index of the power-law of ~0.4 indicates a relatively
hard spectrum. The 0.2-10 keV luminosity was 2x10^{37} with a contribution of
~3% from the disk-blackbody component. A likely origin for the excess emission
is reprocessing of hard X-rays from the neutron star by optically thick
material near the inner edge of an accretion disk. From a timing analysis we
determine the pulse period to 6.85401(1) s indicating an average spin-down of
~0.0017 s per year since the discovery of XTE J0103-728 in May 2003. The X-ray
properties and the identification with a Be star confirm XTE J0103-728 as
Be/X-ray binary transient in the SMC.

taking into account exponential decays of the stored activation, it is possible
to identify the communities also in terms of the patterns of activation along

Alternative models are reflection from ionized matter and absorption in a

excess were tried: thermal disc emission, Comptonization, ionized reflection,
relativistically smeared winds. Comptonization of thermal emission and the
smeared winds provide the best fits, but the other models also provide
acceptable fits. All models, however, return parameters very similar from
source to source, despite the large differences in luminosities, Black Hole
masses and Eddington ratios. Moreover, the smeared wind model require very
large smearing velocities. The UV to X-ray fluxes ratios are very different,

fields to form an electron. A way to do this is examined in this study. A bare
magnetic dipole containing a flux quantum spins stably, and produces an inverse
square E= -vxB electric field similar to what one finds from charge. Gauss' law
finds charge in this model, though there be none. For stability, a current loop
about the waist of the magnetic dipole is needed and we must go beyond the
classical Maxwell's equations to find it. A spinning E field is equivalent to
an electric displacement current. The sideways motion of the spinning E (of
constant magnitude) creates a little-recognized transverse electric
displacement current about the waist. This differs from Maxwell's electric
displacement current, in which E increases in magnitude. The sideways motion of
E supports the dipolar B field, B=vxE/c^2. Beyond the very core of the magnetic
dipole, each of these two velocities is essentially c and vxE/c^2 =
vx(-vxB)/c^2 = B, the spinning E field wholly sourcing the dipolar B field. The
anisotropy of the vxB field is cured by precession about an inclined axis.
Choosing a Bohr magneton for the magnetic dipole and assuming it spins at the
Compton frequency, Gauss' law finds Q = e. The vxB field, normally thought to
be solenoidal, becomes instead a conservative field in this model. Charge is
recognized as merely a mathematical construct, not fundamental but nevertheless
useful. With charge deleted, and with addition of the transverse electric
displacement current, Maxwell's equations can be written in terms of the E and
B fields alone.
