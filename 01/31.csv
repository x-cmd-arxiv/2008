-1/\ell^2 deformed by a gravitational Chern-Simons action with coefficient
1/\mu is studied in an asymptotically AdS_3 spacetime. It is argued to violate
unitary or positivity for generic \mu due to negative-energy massive gravitons.
However at the critical value \mu\ell=1, the massive gravitons disappear and
BTZ black holes all have mass and angular momentum related by \ell M=J. The
corresponding chiral quantum theory of gravity is conjectured to exist and be

the magnetic pressure is about four orders of magnitude higher than the plasma
pressure. Due to the high conductivity the emitting coronal plasma (visible
e.g. in SOHO/EIT) outlines the magnetic field lines. The gradient of the
emitting plasma structures is significantly lower parallel to the magnetic
field lines than in the perpendicular direction. Consequently information
regarding the coronal magnetic field can be used for the interpretation of
coronal plasma structures. We extrapolate the coronal magnetic field from
photospheric magnetic field measurements into the corona. The extrapolation
method depends on assumptions regarding coronal currents, e.g. potential fields
(current free) or force-free fields (current parallel to magnetic field). As a
next step we project the reconstructed 3D magnetic field lines on an EIT-image
and compare with the emitting plasma structures. Coronal loops are identified
as closed magnetic field lines with a high emissivity in EIT and a small
gradient of the emissivity along the magnetic field.

the computation of four-particle amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills and N=8

coefficients - including signs - of these two types of contribution. The role
of corrections is to cancel unphysical singularities generically present in
rung-rule integrals. A further byproduct, coming from the fact such unphysical
singularities are located where conformal cross-ratios become unity, is the
possibility of understanding the dual conformal invariance ansatz for
constructing the basis of four-particle amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills.

infrared luminous galaxies obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the
Spitzer Space Telescope. These sources were jointly selected from Spitzer and
Chandra imaging surveys in the NDWFS Bootes field and were selected from their
bright X-ray fluxes to host luminous AGN. None of the spectra show significant
emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; 6.2um equivalent widths
<0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by AGN. Nine
of the X-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. Their redshifts
are in the range 0.9<z<2.6, implying infrared luminosities of
log(L{IR})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. The average silicate absorption
strength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faint
infrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying that
the X-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of Si-rich dust than
non-X-ray selection. Seven of the X-ray sources have featureless power-law
mid-IR spectra. We argue that the featureless spectra likely result from the
sources having weak or absent silicate and PAH features rather than the sources
lying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the IRS
spectral window. We investigate whether there are any correlations between
X-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorption
features tend to have fainter X-ray fluxes and harder X-ray spectra, indicating
a weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density of
X-ray-absorbing gas.

  More specifically, let K_0 be an arbitrary prime field and let r and s be

find a finite extension K of K_0, a degree-r extension L of K, a degree-s
extension M of K, and two curves C and D over K such that C and D become
isomorphic to one another over L and over M, but not over any proper
subextensions of L/K or M/K.
  We show that such C and D can never have genus 0, and that if K is finite, C
and D can have genus 1 if and only if {r,s} = {2,3} and K is an odd-degree
extension of F_3. On the other hand, when {r,s}={2,3} we show that genus-2

  Our detailed analysis of the case {r,s} = {2,3} shows that over every finite
field K there exist nonisomorphic curves C and D that become isomorphic to one
another over the quadratic and cubic extensions of K.
  Most of our proofs rely on Galois cohomology. Without using Galois
cohomology, we show that two nonisomorphic genus-0 curves over an arbitrary
field remain nonisomorphic over every odd-degree extension of the base field.

that these criteria provide a better resolution of the flow past the

high percentage of the over-loading factor degrades the system performance in
noisy channels, simulation results show that this degradation is not
significant. More importantly, for moderate values of Eb/N0 (in the range of
6-10 dB) or higher, the proposed codes perform much better than the binary

considered an unusual form of mass-energy generically called dark energy. Dark
energy has a ratio of pressure over mass density which obeys $w=p/\rho <-1/3$.
This form of mass-energy leads to accelerated expansion. An extreme form of
dark energy, called phantom energy, has been proposed which has $w=p/\rho <-1$.
This possibility is favored by the observational data. The simplest model for
phantom energy involves the introduction of a scalar field with a negative
kinetic energy term. Here we show that theories based on graded Lie algebras
naturally have such a negative kinetic energy and thus give a model for phantom
energy in a less ad hoc manner. We find that the model also contains ordinary
scalar fields and anti-commuting (Grassmann) vector fields which act as a form
of two component dark matter. Thus from a gauge theory based on a graded
algebra we naturally obtained both phantom energy and dark matter.

problem on the inversion of the transformation L. We shall show that this
problem is closely related to N.Steenrod's problem on realization of cycles and
to the Rokhlin-Schwartz-Thom construction of combinatorial Pontryagin classes.
It is easy to obtain a condition of balancing that is a necessary condition for
a set of isomorphism classes of combinatorial spheres to belong to the image of
the transformation L. In the present paper we give an explicit construction
providing that each balanced set of isomorphism classes of combinatorial
spheres gets into the image of L after passing to a multiple set and adding
several pairs of the form (Z,-Z), where -Z is the sphere Z with the orientation
reversed. This construction enables us, for a given singular simplicial cycle
of a space R, to construct explicitly a combinatorial manifold M and a mapping
$\phi:M\to R$ such that $\phi_*[M]=r[\xi]$ for some positive integer r. The
construction is based on resolving singularities of the cycle $\xi$. We give
applications of our main construction to cobordisms of manifolds with
singularities and cobordisms of simple cells. In particular, we prove that

efficient characterization of eigenmodes, and in allowing a clear connection to
free-space propagation of the input (seeding) and output radiation. The

redshift compared to other observed bursts, naturally lead to the question of
how these low-luminosity (LL) bursts are related to high-luminosity (HL)
bursts. Incorporating the constraints from both the flux-limited samples
observed with CGRO/BATSE and Swift/BAT and the redshift-known GRB sample, we
investigate the luminosity function for both LL- and HL-GRBs through
simulations. Our multiple criteria, including the log N - log P distributions
from the flux-limited GRB sample, the redshift and luminosity distributions of
the redshift-known sample, and the detection ratio of HL- and LL- GRBs with
Swift/BAT, provide a set of stringent constraints to the luminosity function.
Assuming that the GRB rate follows the star formation rate, our simulations
show that a simple power law or a broken power law model of luminosity function
fail to reproduce the observations, and a new component is required. This
component can be modeled with a broken power, which is characterized by a sharp
increase of the burst number at around L < 10^47 erg s^-1}. The lack of
detection of moderate-luminosity GRBs at redshift ~0.3 indicates that this
feature is not due to observational biases. The inferred local rate, rho_0, of
LL-GRBs from our model is ~ 200 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 at ~ 10^47 erg s^-1, much larger
than that of HL-GRBs. These results imply that LL-GRBs could be a separate GRB
population from HL-GRBs. The recent discovery of a local X-ray transient

large-scale (>> $1 Billion US) missions to detect and characterize earth-like
planets around nearby stars, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder
Interferometer (TPF-I) and Darwin missions. However, technological and
budgetary issues as well as shifting science priorities will likely prevent
these missions from entering Phase A until the next decade. The secondary
eclipse technique using the Spitzer Space Telescope has been used to directly
measure the temperature and emission spectrum of extrasolar planets. However,
only a small fraction of known extrasolar planets are in transiting orbits.
Thus, a simplified nulling interferometer, which produces an artificial eclipse
or occultation, and operates in the near- to mid-infrared (e.g. ~ 3 to 8 or 10
microns), can characterize the atmospheres of this much larger sample of the
known but non-transiting exoplanets. Many other scientific problems can be
addressed with a system like this, including imaging debris disks, active
galactic nuclei, and low mass companions around nearby stars. We discuss the
rationale for a probe-scale mission in the $600-800 Million range, which we
name here as the Small Prototype Planet Finding Interferometer (SPPFI).

from the action of a member of the local Clifford group on a graph state, and
comprises a graph which encodes the magnitude properties of the state, and a

showed these objects as unresolved intergalactic HII regions having Halpha

magnitudes along with previously-determined Halpha luminosities, we place
limits on the masses and ages of each association, considering the importance
of stochastic effects for faint (M_V >-8) stellar populations. The upper limits
to their stellar masses range from 600 M_sun to 7000 M_sun, and ages range from
2 - 6 Myrs. This analysis includes an updated calculation of the conversion
factor between the ionizing luminosity and the total number of main sequence O
stars contained within an HII region. The photometric properties and sizes of
the isolated associations and other objects in the HRC fields are consistent
with those of Galactic stellar associations, open clusters and/or single O and
B stars. We interpret the age-size sequence of associations and clustered field
objects as an indication that these isolated associations are most likely
rapidly dispersing. Furthermore, we consider the possibility that these
isolated associations represent the first generation of stars in the HI ring

Our best model has a kinetic energy of 1.4x10E51 erg and synthesizes 0.97 Msun
of 56Ni. These results are in excellent agreement with the age estimate and
spectroscopy from the light echo. We have thus established the first connection
between a Type Ia supernova and its supernova remnant based on a detailed

to show that the morphologies of the tidal features that are seen around a
large fraction of nearby, massive ellipticals in the field, cannot be
reproduced by equal-mass dissipationless mergers; rather, they are well
explained by the accretion of disk-dominated galaxies. In particular, the arm-
and looplike morphologies of the observed tidal debris can only be produced by
the kinematically cold material of the disk components of the accreted
galaxies. The tidal features that arise from such ""cold-accretion"" events onto
a massive elliptical are visible for significantly longer timescales than the
features produced by elliptical-elliptical mergers (about 1-2 Gyr vs. a few
hundred million years). Mass ratios of the order of 1:10 between the accreting
elliptical and the accreted disk are sufficient to match the brightness of the
observed debris. Furthermore, stellar population synthesis models and simple
order-of-magnitude calculations indicate that the colors of the tidal features
generated in such minor cold-accretion events are relatively red, in agreement
with the observations. The minor cold-accretion events that explain the
presence, brightness, and structural and color properties of the tidal debris
cause only a modest mass and luminosity increase in the accreting massive
elliptical. These results, coupled with the relative statistical frequencies of
disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies in the field, suggest that massive
ellipticals assemble most of their mass well before their tidal debris forms
through the accretion of relatively little, kinematically cold material rather

cosmic-ray (CR) electron spreading and thus largely reproduce the appearance of
radio images. Using a wavelet analysis we decompose each 70 $\micron$ image
into one component containing the star-forming {\it structures} and a second
one for the diffuse {\it disk}. The components are smoothed separately, and
their combination compared to a free-free corrected 22 cm radio image; the
scale-lengths are then varied to best match the radio and smoothed infrared
images. We find that late-type spirals having high amounts of ongoing star
formation benefit most from the two-component method. We also find that the

propose that this result arises from an age effect rather than from differences
in CR electron diffusion due to varying ISM parameters. The bulk of the CR
electron population in actively star-forming galaxies is significantly younger
than that in less active galaxies due to recent episodes of enhanced star
formation; these galaxies are observed within $\sim10^{8}$ yr since the onset

disks and rings are present around the host galaxies of a significant fraction
of low power compact radio sources, while no large-scale HI is detected in low
power, edge-darkened FR-I radio galaxies. Preliminary results of a study of
nearby powerful, edge-brightened FR-II radio galaxies show that these systems
generally contain significant amounts of large-scale HI, often distributed in
tail- or bridge-like structures, indicative of a recent galaxy merger or
collision. Our results suggest that different types of radio galaxies may have
a different formation history, which could be related to a difference in the
triggering mechanism of the radio source. If confirmed by larger studies with
the next generation radio telescopes, this would be in agreement with previous
optical studies that suggest that powerful FR-II radio sources are likely
triggered by galaxy mergers and collisions, while the lower power FR-I sources
are fed in other ways (e.g. through the accretion of hot IGM). The giant HI
disks/rings associated with some compact sources could - at least in some cases

consequently have interferometric phases near zero. We used this property to
detect and correct for the effects of the instrument and atmosphere on the
phases of beta Lyrae and to obtain differential phases in the channel
containing the Halpha emission line. Combining the Halpha-channel phases with
information about the line strength, we recovered complex visibilities and
imaged the Halpha emission using standard radio interferometry methods. We find
that the results from our differential phase technique are consistent with
those obtained from a more-standard analysis using squared visibilities
(V^2's). Our images show the position of the Halpha emitting regions relative
to the continuum photocenter as a function of orbital phase and indicate that
the major axis of the orbit is oriented along p.a.=248.8+/-1.7 deg. The orbit
is smaller than previously predicted, a discrepancy that can be alleviated if
we assume that the system is at a larger distance from us, or that the
contribution of the stellar continuum to the Halpha channel is larger than
estimated. Finally, we also detected a differential phase signal in the
channels containing HeI emission lines at 587.6 and 706.5nm, with orbital
behavior different from that of the Halpha, indicating that it originates from
a different part of this interacting system.

(ULIRGs) observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph.
Dust emission dominates the MIR spectra of ULIRGs, and the reprocessed
radiation that emerges is independent of the underlying heating spectrum.
Instead, the resulting emission depends sensitively on the geometric
distribution of the dust, which we diagnose with comparisons of numerical
simulations of radiative transfer. Quantifying the silicate emission and
absorption features that appear near 10 and 18um requires a reliable
determination of the continuum, and we demonstrate that including a measurement
of the continuum at intermediate wavelength (between the features) produces
accurate results at all optical depths. With high-quality spectra, we
successfully use the silicate features to constrain the dust chemistry. The
observations of the ULIRGs and local sightlines require dust that has a
relatively high 18/10um absorption ratio of the silicate features (around 0.5).
Specifically, the cold dust of Ossenkopf et al. (1992) is consistent with the
observations, while other dust models are not. We use the silicate feature
strengths to identify two families of ULIRGs, in which the dust distributions
are fundamentally different. Optical spectral classifications are related to
these families. In ULIRGs that harbor an active galactic nucleus, the
spectrally broad lines are detected only when the nuclear surroundings are
clumpy. In contrast, the sources of lower ionization optical spectra are deeply
embedded in smooth distributions of optically thick dust.

Comments welcome",,"10.1086/588460",,"astro-ph",,"  We present new HST optical imagery as well as new UV and IR spectroscopic
data obtained with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, respectively, of
the halo planetary nebula DdDm-1. For the first time we present a resolved
image of this object which indicates that the morphology of DdDm-1 can be
described as two orthogonal elliptical components in the central part
surrounded by an extended halo. The extent of the emission is somewhat larger
than was previously reported in the literature. We combine the spectral data
with our own previously published optical measurements to derive nebular
abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, S, Cl, Ar, and Fe. Our abundance
determinations include the use of the newly developed program ELSA for
obtaining abundances directly from emission line strengths along with detailed
photoionization models to render a robust set of abundances for this object.
The metallicity, as gauged by oxygen, is found to be 0.46 dex below the solar
value, confirming DdDm-1's status as a halo PN. In addition, we find that Si
and Fe are markedly underabundant, suggesting their depletion onto dust. The
very low (but uncertain) C/O ratio suggests that the chemistry of the nebula
should be consistent with an oxygen-rich environment. We find that the sulfur
abundance of DdDm-1 is only slightly below the value expected based upon the
normal lockstep behavior between S and O observed in H II regions and blue
compact galaxies. The central star effective temperature and luminosity are
estimated to be 55,000 K and 1000 solar luminosities, respectively, implying an
initial progenitor mass of <1 solar masses. Finally, we report on a new radial
velocity determination from echelle observations.

which allows a natural supersymmetry-breaking mediation mechanism of (finite)

thereby solving the latter's tachyonic slepton problem. We make the non-trivial

branch (EHB) stars in Galactic globular clusters, has thus far constituted a
major puzzle, in view of the fact that blue subdwarf stars - the field
counterparts of cluster EHB stars - are well-known to present a high binary
fraction. In this Letter, we provide new results that confirm the lack of close
EHB binaries in globular clusters, and present a first scenario to explain the
difference between field and cluster EHB stars. First, in order to confirm that
the lack of EHB binaries in globular clusters is a statistically robust result,
we undertook a new analysis of 145 horizontal branch stars in NGC6752, out of
which forty-one belong to the EHB. To search for radial-velocity variations as
a function of time, we repeated high-resolution (R=18500) spectroscopy of all
stars, four times during a single night of observations. We detected a single,
hot (25000 K), radial-velocity variable star as a close-binary candidate. From
these results, we estimate an upper-limit for the close (period P < 5 day)
binary fraction f among NGC6752 EHB stars of 16% (95% confidence level), with
the most probable value being f=4%. Thus our results clearly confirm the lack
of close binaries among the hot HB stars in this cluster. We suggest that the
confirmed discrepancy between the binary fractions for field and cluster EHB
stars is the consequence of an f-age relation, with close binaries being more
likely in the case of younger systems. We analyze theoretical and observational
results available in the literature, which support this scenario. If so, an age
difference between the EHB progenitors in the field and in clusters, the former
being younger (on average) by up to several Gyr, would naturally account for
the startling differences in binary fraction between the two populations.

radio observations with limited precision. We made new radio continuum and
polarization observations of S147 at 11cm and at 6cm with the Effelsberg 100-m

combined with published lower frequency data from the Effelsberg 100-m

turnover and polarization properties of S147. S147 consists of numerous
filaments embedded in diffuse emission. We found that the integrated flux
densities of S147 are 34.8+/-4.0 Jy at 11cm and 15.4+/-3.0Jy at 6cm. These new
measurements confirm the known spectral turnover at ~1.5GHz, which can be
entirely attributed to the diffuse emission component. The spectral index above
the turnover is -1.35+/-0.20. The filamentary emission component has a constant
spectral index over the entire wavelength range up to 40.7GHz of -0.35+/-0.15.
The weak polarized emission of S147 is at the same level as the ambient diffuse
Galactic polarization. The rotation measure of the eastern filamentary shell is
about -70 rad/m2. The filamentary and diffuse emission components of S147 have
different physical properties, which make S147 outstanding among shell type
SNRs.The weak polarization of S147 at 11cm and at 6cm can be attributed to a
section of the S147 shell showing a tangential magnetic field direction.

by disrupting some aspect of DNA replication or repair. Mutators that increase
the mutation rate by the order of 100 fold have been observed to spontaneously
emerge and achieve high frequencies in natural populations and in long-term
laboratory evolution experiments with \textit{E. coli}. In principle, the
fixation of mutator alleles is limited by (i) competition with mutations in
wild-type backgrounds, (ii) additional deleterious mutational load, and (iii)
random genetic drift. Using a multiple locus model and employing both
simulation and analytic methods, we investigate the effects of these three
factors on the fixation probability $P_{fix}$ of an initially rare mutator as a
function of population size $N$, beneficial and deleterious mutation rates, and
the strength of mutations $s$. Our diffusion based approximation for $P_{fix}$
successfully captures effects (ii) and (iii) when selection is fast compared to
mutation ($\mu/s \ll 1$). This enables us to predict the conditions under which
mutators will be evolutionarily favored. Surprisingly, our simulations show
that effect (i) is typically small for strong-effect mutators. Our results
agree semi-quantitatively with existing laboratory evolution experiments and
suggest future experimental directions.

the interface problem assuming electrical charges are actually particles having

movement of free charge cannot produce a net electrical current anywhere in the

effect of the quasi-2D nature of the experimental FQH system on a number of FQH
states (fillings 1/3, 1/5, 1/2) in the lowest, second, and third Landau levels
(LLL, SLL, TLL,) by calculating the overlap, as a function of quasi-2D layer
thickness, between the exact ground state of a model Hamiltonian and the
consensus variational wavefunctions (Laughlin wavefunction for 1/3 and 1/5 and
the Moore-Read Pfaffian wavefunction for 1/2). Using large overlap as a
stability, or FQHE robustness, criterion we find the FQHE does not occur in the
TLL (for any thickness), is the most robust for zero thickness in the LLL for
1/3 and 1/5 and for 11/5 in the SLL, and is most robust at finite-thickness
(4-5 magnetic lengths) in the SLL for the mysterious 5/2 state and the 7/3
state. No FQHE is found at 1/2 in the LLL for any thickness. We examine the
orbital effects of an in-plane (parallel) magnetic field finding its
application effectively reduces the thickness and could destroy the FQHE at 5/2
and 7/3, while enhancing it at 11/5 as well as for LLL FQHE states. The
in-plane field effects could thus be qualitatively different in the LLL and the
SLL by virtue of magneto-orbital coupling through the finite thickness effect.
In the torus geometry, we show the appearance of the threefold topological
degeneracy expected for the Pfaffian state which is enhanced by thickness
corroborating our findings from overlap calculations. Our results have
ramifications for wavefunction engineering--the possibility of creating an
optimal experimental system where the 5/2 FQHE state is more likely described
by the Pfaffian state with applications to topological quantum computing.

tapping large amounts of fresh water and energy. The mountains are inflatable
semi-cylindrical constructions from thin film (gas bags) having heights of up

Encountering these artificial mountains, humid air (wind) rises to crest
altitude, is cooled and produces rain (or rain clouds). Many natural mountains
are sources of rivers, and other forms of water and power production - and
artificial mountains may provide these services for entire nations in the
future. The film of these gasbags is supported at altitude by small additional
atmospheric overpressure and may be connected to the ground by thin cables. The

  Future Space-Based Surveys","5 pages and 3 figures",,"10.1086/586880",,"astro-ph",,"  If a microlensing event is caused by a star, the event can exhibit change in
color due to the light from the lens. In the previous and current lensing
surveys, the color shift could not be used to constrain the lens population
because the blended light responsible for the color shift is mostly attributed
to nearby background stars rather than the lens. However, events to be observed
in future space-based surveys do not suffer from blending and thus the color
information can be used to constrain lenses. In this paper, we demonstrate the
usefulness of future surveys in measuring color shifts. By conducting
simulation of galactic lensing events based on the specification of a proposed
space-based lensing survey, we estimate that the shift in the color of $R-H$
will be measured at 5$\sigma$ level for $\sim 12%$ of events that occur on
source stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than $J=22.5$. Color-shifted
events tend to have high magnifications and the lenses will have brightnesses
equivalent to those of source stars. The time scales of the color-shifted
events tend to be longer than those without color shifts. From the mass
distribution of lenses, we find that most of the color-shifted events will be
produced by stellar lenses with spectral types down to mid M-type main sequence
stars.

study the dependence of the clustering strength on rest-frame UV and optical
magnitudes, which can be indicators of star formation rate and stellar mass,
respectively. The correlation length is found to be a strong function of both
UV and optical magnitudes with brighter galaxies being more clustered than
faint ones in both cases. Furthermore, the correlation length is dependent on a
combination of UV and optical magnitudes in the sense that galaxies bright in
optical magnitude have large correlation lengths irrespective of UV magnitude,
while galaxies faint in optical magnitude have correlation lengths decreasing
with decreasing UV brightness. These results suggest that galaxies with large
stellar masses always belong to massive halos in which they can have various
star formation rates, while galaxies with small stellar masses reside in less
massive halos only if they have low star formation rates. There appears to be
an upper limit to the stellar mass and the star formation rate which is

of two stars built predominantly of strange quark matter independently on the
total mass of a binary system and compactness parameter of each star. In
contrast, for neutron stars described by baryonic equation of state without
exotic phases the ISCO is given by the mass-shedding limit. The gravitational
wave frequency at the ISCO, which marks the end of the inspiral phase, is
always higher than 1.1kHz for equal masses irrotational strange quark stars

flow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid
temperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this
instability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes.
Using the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the
reported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature
fluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels.
Indeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be
accounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the
same spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following
the slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature
drop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's
temperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the
fluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The negative
skewness of fluctuations at high $Ra$ supports the picture of a boundary layer
instability. These observations provide new evidence that the transition
reported in 1997 corresponds to the triggering of the Ultimate Regime of
convection.

modelled and shown to be consistent with an NFW profile with a characteristic

known mass profile of Fornax. However, there are a number of peculiarities in

  The simplest possible threshing model is tested, in which dwarf galaxies move
on orbits in a static cluster potential and are threshed if they pass within a
radius at which the tidal force from the cluster exceeds the internal gravity
at the core of their dark matter halo. This fails to reproduce the observed

composition is adjusted to allow maximum upper barrier height for a given well
width. In contrast to other material systems the BIA contribution to spin
splitting is found to be of significant and comparable value to the SIA
mechanism in these structures. We calculate the spin lifetime for spins
oriented along [11-0] based on D'yakonov-Perel mechanism using both the theory
of Averkiev et al. [J. Phys.:Condens. Matter 14 (2002)] and also the rate of
precession of spins about the effective magnetic field, taking into account all
three SO couplings, showing good agreement.Spin lifeime for this direction is
largest in the narrow wells over the range of moderate carrier densities
considered, which is attributed to the reduced magnitude of the k-cubic BIA
parameter in narrow wells. The inherently large BIA induced SO coupling in
these systems is shown to have considerable effect on the spin lifetime, which
exhibits significant reduction in the maximum spin lifetime compared to
previous studies which consider systems with relatively weak BIA induced SO
coupling. The relaxation rate of spins oriented in the [001] direction is
dominated by the k-linear SIA and BIA coupling parameters and at least an order
of magnitude greater than in the [11-0] direction.

by percolation phenomena, on adaptive networks the rewiring process leads to
different behaviors: Adaptive rewiring fosters group formation by enhancing
communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also makes possible
the division of clusters. We show how the convergence time is determined by the
characteristic time of link rearrangement. We finally investigate how the

relativistic outflows. The outflows are initially sub-Alfv\'enic and Poynting
flux-dominated, with total--to--rest-mass energy flux ratio up to $\mu \sim
620$. To study the magnetic acceleration of jets we simulate flows confined
within a funnel with rigid wall of prescribed shape, which we take to be
$z\propto r^a$ (in cylindrical coordinates, with $a$ ranging from 1 to 2). This
allows us to eliminate the numerical dissipative effects induced by a free
boundary with an ambient medium. We find that in all cases they converge to a
steady state characterized by a spatially extended acceleration region. For the
jet solutions the acceleration process is very efficient - on the outermost
scale of the simulation more than half of the Poynting flux has been converted
into kinetic energy flux, and the terminal Lorentz factor approached its
maximum possible value ($\Gamma_\infty \simeq \mu$). The acceleration is
accompanied by the collimation of magnetic field lines in excess of that
dictated by the funnel shape. The numerical solutions are generally consistent
with the semi-analytic self-similar jets solutions and the spatially extended
acceleration observed in some astrophysical relativistic jets. In agreement
with previous studies we also find that the acceleration is significantly less
effective for wind solutions suggesting that pulsar winds may remain Poynting
dominated when they reach the termination shock.

Arranging the wave functions by increasing values of the Laplace-Beltrami

In particular we investigate the distribution of the normalized counts
$\frac{\nu_n}{n}$ for sequences of eigenfunctions with $K \le n\le K + \Delta

a limit as $K,\Delta K\to\infty$ (the classical limit), and study the leading

HI disk is sharply truncated to the southwest, well within the stellar disk. A
region of low surface-density gas, which is more extended than the main HI
disk, is discovered northeast of the galaxy center. These data are compared to
existing 6cm polarized radio continuum emission, Halpha, and optical broad band
images. We observe a coincidence between the western HI and polarized emission
edges, on the one hand, and a faint Halpha emission ridge, on the other. The
polarized emission maxima are located within the gaps between the spiral arms
and the faint Halpha ridge. Based on the comparison of these observations with
a sample of dynamical simulations with different values for maximum ram
pressure and different inclination angles between the disk and the orbital
plane,we conclude that ram pressure stripping can account for the main observed
characteristics. NGC 4501 is stripped nearly edge-on, is heading southwest, and
is ~200-300 Myr before peak ram pressure, i.e. its closest approach to M87. The
southwestern ridge of enhanced gas surface density and enhanced polarized
radio-continuum emission is due to ram pressure compression. It is argued that
the faint western Halpha emission ridge is induced by nearly edge-on ram
pressure stripping. NGC 4501 represents an especially clear example of early
stage ram pressure stripping of a large cluster-spiral galaxy.

the ratio of susceptibilities perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic planes

Antiferromagnetic order occurs at a N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N}$=2.07 K, a

all cases the magnitude of the RM increases in the higher frequency

Faraday rotation, the polarization orientation in the jet is either parallel or
perpendicular to the jet direction. A transverse Rotation Measure (RM) gradient
was detected in the jet of 0954+658, providing evidence for the presence of a
helical magnetic field surrounding the jet. For three of the sources (0954+658,

an explanation for this in terms of bends in a relativistic jet surrounded by a

Brownian motion (ggBm), is made up off self-similar with stationary increments
processes (H-sssi) and depends on two real parameters alpha in (0,2) and beta
in (0,1]. It includes fractional Brownian motion when alpha in (0,2) and
beta=1, and time-fractional diffusion stochastic processes when alpha=beta in
(0,1). The latters have marginal probability density function governed by
time-fractional diffusion equations of order beta. The ggBm is defined through
the explicit construction of the underline probability space. However, in this
paper we show that it is possible to define it in an unspecified probability
space. For this purpose, we write down explicitly all the finite dimensional
probability density functions. Moreover, we provide different ggBm
characterizations. The role of the M-Wright function, which is related to the
fundamental solution of the time-fractional diffusion equation, emerges as a
natural generalization of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we show that
ggBm can be represented in terms of the product of a random variable, which is
related to the M-Wright function, and an independent fractional Brownian
motion. This representation highlights the $H$-{\bf sssi} nature of the ggBm
and provides a way to study and simulate the trajectories. For this purpose, we
developed a random walk model based on a finite difference approximation of a
partial integro-differenital equation of fractional type.

  ISAS/JAXA, Sagamihara, Japan)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We are using ""broadband"" (4.6 to 43 GHz) multi-frequency VLBA polarization
observations of compact AGN to investigate the 3-D structure of their jet
magnetic (B) fields. Observing at several frequencies, separated by short and
long intervals, enables reliable determination of the distribution of Faraday
Rotation, and thereby the intrinsic B field structure. Transverse Rotation
Measure (RM) gradients were detected in the jets of 0954+658 and 1418+546,
providing evidence for the presence of a helical B field surrounding the jet.
The RM in the core regions of 2200+420 (BL Lac), 0954+658 and 1418+546 display
different signs in different frequency-intervals (on different spatial scales);
we suggest an explanation for this in terms of modest bends in a helical B
field surrounding their jets. In future, polarization observations with a
combination of VSOP-2 at 8, 22 and 43 GHz and ground arrays at frequencies with
corresponding resolution will help map out the distributions of Faraday
rotation, spectral index and the 3-D B field structure both across the jet and
closer to the central engine, providing strong constraints for any jet B field
models.

silicon quantum dot. In the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field, we find
that spin-orbit coupling is not the main source of singlet-triplet relaxation.
Relaxation in this regime occurs mainly via virtual states and is due to
nuclear hyperfine coupling. In the presence of an external magnetic field
perpendicular to the plane of the dot, the spin-orbit coupling is important and
virtual states are not required. We find that there can be strong anisotropy
for different field directions: parallel magnetic field can increase
substantially the relaxation time due to Zeeman splitting, but when the
magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane, the enhancement of the
spin-orbit effect shortens the relaxation time. We find the relaxation to be
orders of magnitude longer than for GaAs quantum dots, due to weaker hyperfine
and spin-orbit effects.

its geometrical oblateness cannot be explained in the Roche approximation, has
stirred substantial interest in the community, in view of its potential impact
in many fields of stellar astrophysics. It is the purpose of this paper to
reinterpret the interferometric observations with a fast rotating, gravity
darkened central star surrounded by a small equatorial disk, whose presence is
consistent with contemporaneous spectroscopic data. We find that we can only
fit the available data assuming a critically rotating central star. We
identified two different disk models that simultaneously fit the spectroscopic,
polarimetric, and interferometric observational constraints: a tenuous disk in
hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., with small scaleheight) and a smaller,
scaleheight enhanced disk. We believe that these relatively small disks
correspond to the transition region between the photosphere and the
circumstellar environment, and that they are probably perturbed by some
photospheric mechanism. The study of this interface between photosphere and
circumstellar disk for near-critical rotators is crucial to our understanding
of the Be phenomenon, and the mass and angular momentum loss of stars in
general. This work shows that it is nowadays possible to directly study this
transition region from simultaneous multi-technique observations.

triggers and identified pi+-, p, and pbar triggers in d+Au and Au+Au collisions
and 3-particle jet-like azimuthal correlations in pp, d+Au, and Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV. These results use data from the STAR TPC during
RHIC runs II, III, and IV. Modifications in 2-particle correlations are
observed in Au+Au collisions. These modifications are not seen in $pp$ or d+Au
collisions. This demonstrates that the modifications are due to final state
nuclear effects. High pT protons, anti-protons and charged pions are identified
by the relativistic rise of dE/dx in the STAR TPC. Correlations of charged
hadrons with high pT p, pbar, and pi+- show no discernible difference. The
results post challenges to recombination and coalescence models which are
otherwise very successful in explaining the large baryon/meson ratio and the
splitting of the elliptic flow at intermediate pT. In central Au+Au collisions,
the away-side 2-particle correlation is significantly broadened and even double
humped in selective kinematic ranges. Three-particle correlations were employed
to identify the underlying physics mechanism(s). Results in pp, d+Au and
peripheral Au+Au collisions show dijet structure with away-side kT broadening.
Results in mid-central and central Au+Au collisions are consistent with a
near-side jet and on the away-side a combination of conical emission and large
angle gluon radiation and deflected jets. The associated pT independent
emission angle suggests Mach-cone shock waves being the underlying physics
mechanism for the conical emission. The emission angle is measured to be
1.39+-0.01 (stat.)+-0.04(sys.) in ZDC triggered 0-12% Au+Au data.

reasonably accurate if considering the HWHM. For distant nebulae, entirely

corresponding superparticle model is formulated in the N=2 harmonic superspace
