sigma models, which perturbatively are intimately related to the theory of
chiral differential operators (CDOs). The grading by charge and scaling
dimension is anomalous if the first Chern class of the target space is nonzero.
This has some nontrivial consequences for the chiral algebra. As an example, we
study the case where the target space is CP^1, and show that worldsheet
instantons trivialize the chiral algebra entirely. Consequently, supersymmetry
is spontaneously broken in this model. We then turn to a closer look at the
supersymmetry breaking from the viewpoint of Morse theory on loop space. We
find that instantons interpolate between pairs of perturbative supersymmetric
states with different fermionic numbers, hence lifting them out of the
supersymmetric spectrum. Our results reveal that a ""quantum"" deformation of the
geometry of the target space leads to a trivialization of the kernels of
certain twisted Dirac operators on CP^1.

maximum edge congestion $C$ and maximum path length $D$. Here, we study
bicriteria in routing games where each player $i$ selfishly selects a path that
simultaneously minimizes its maximum edge congestion $C_i$ and path length
$D_i$. We study the stability and price of anarchy of two bicriteria games:
  - {\em Max games}, where the social cost is $\max(C,D)$ and the player cost
is $\max(C_i, D_i)$. We prove that max games are stable and convergent under
best-response dynamics, and that the price of anarchy is bounded above by the
maximum path length in the players' strategy sets. We also show that this bound
is tight in worst-case scenarios.
  - {\em Sum games}, where the social cost is $C+D$ and the player cost is
$C_i+D_i$. For sum games, we first show the negative result that there are game
instances that have no Nash-equilibria. Therefore, we examine an approximate
game called the {\em sum-bucket game} that is always convergent (and therefore
stable). We show that the price of anarchy in sum-bucket games is bounded above
by $C^* \cdot D^* / (C^* + D^*)$ (with a poly-log factor), where $C^*$ and
$D^*$ are the optimal coordinated congestion and path length. Thus, the
sum-bucket game has typically superior price of anarchy bounds than the max
game. In fact, when either $C^*$ or $D^*$ is small (e.g. constant) the social
cost of the Nash-equilibria is very close to the coordinated optimal $C^* +
D^*$ (within a poly-log factor). We also show that the price of anarchy bound
is tight for cases where both $C^*$ and $D^*$ are large.

significant is that BEC in periodic potentials is a truly interdisciplinary
problem, with obvious connections with electrons in crystal lattices, polarons
and photons in optical fibers. Moreover, the BEC experimentalists have reached
such a high level of accuracy to create in the lab, so to speak, paradigmatic

the three element semiring S, is dual to the category of partially Stone
spaces. We place this duality in the context of natural dualities. We begin by
introducing a topological structure \uS and obtain an optimal natural duality
between the quasi-variety ISP(S) and the category IS_cP+(\uS). Then we
construct an optimal and very small structure \uS_os that yields a strong
duality. The geometry of some of the partially Stone spaces that take part in
these dualities is presented, and we call them ""hairy cubes"", as they are
n-dimensional cubes with unique incomparable covers for each element of the
cube. We also obtain a polynomial representation for the elements of the hairy

estimated. The advent of ensembles of such simulations exploring a variety of
conditions permits us to assess the robustness of the standard model for Pop
III.1 star formation and investigate scatter in their formation redshifts and
accretion rates, thereby providing much needed information about the Pop III
IMF. The simulations confirm the prediction that Pop III.1 stars were massive
($\sim 100 \Msun$), and form in isolation in primordial mini-halos. Simulations
of Pop III.2 star forming in relic HII regions suggest somewhat lower masses
($\sim 30 \Msun$) which may help explain the chemical abundances of extremely
metal poor stars. We note that no 3D simulation at present has achieved stellar
density let alone followed the entire accretion history of the star in any

  Extinction Law with Star-Formation","7 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13050.x",,"astro-ph",,"  This paper presents a mechanism that may modify the extinction law for SNIa
observed at higher redshift. Starting from the observations that (1) SNIa occur
predominantly in spiral galaxies, (2) star-formation ejects ISM out of the
plane of spirals, (3) star-formation alters the extinction properties of the
dust in the ISM, and (4) there is substantially more star-formation at higher
redshift, I propose that spiral galaxies have a dustier halo in the past than
they do now. The ejected material's lower value of $R_V$ will lead to a lower
average value ($\bar{R}_V$) for SNIa observed at higher redshift.
  Two relations in SNIa observations indicate evolution of the average $R_V$:
the relation of observed $R_V$ with inclination of the host galaxy at low
redshift and the matching of the distribution of extinction values ($A_V$) for
SNIa in different redshift intervals. The inclination effect does point to a
halo with lower $R_V$ values. In contrast, the distributions of $A_V$ values
match best for a $\bar{R}_V(z)$ evolution that mimics the relation of SNIa
dimming with redshift attributed to the cosmological constant. However, even in
the worse case scenario, the evolution $\bar{R}_V$ can not fully explain the
dimming of SNIa: host galaxy extinction law evolution is not a viable
alternative to account for the dimming of SNIa.
  Future observations of SNIa --multi-color lightcurves and spectra-- will
solve separately for values of $A_V$ and $R_V$ for each SNIa . Solving for
evolution of $\bar{R}_V$ (and $A_V$) with redshift will be important for the
coming generation of cosmological SNIa measurements and has the bonus science
of insight into the distribution of dust-rich ISM in the host galaxies in the
distant past.

spectra of the secondary star (Gonz\'alez Hern\'andez et al. 2006), we perform
a detailed abundance analysis including the abundances of Si and Ti. These
element abundances, higher than solar, indicate that the black hole in this
system formed in a supernova event, whose nucleosynthetic products could
pollute the atmosphere of the secondary star, providing clues on the possible
formation region of the system, either Galactic halo, thick disk, or thin disk.
We explore a grid of explosion models with different He core masses,
metallicities, and geometries. Metal-poor models associated with a formation
scenario in the Galactic halo provide unacceptable fits to the observed
abundances, allowing us to reject a halo origin for this X-ray binary. The
thick-disk scenario produces better fits, although they require substantial
fallback and very efficient mixing processes between the inner layers of the
explosion and the ejecta, making quite unlikely an origin in the thick disk.
The best agreement between the model predictions and the observed abundances is
obtained for metal-rich progenitor models. In particular, non-spherically
symmetric models are able to explain, without strong assumptions of extensive
fallback and mixing, the observed abundances. Moreover, asymmetric mass
ejection in a supernova explosion could account for the required impulse
necessary to launch the system from its formation region in the Galactic thin
disk to its current halo orbit.

originates from Co2+ oxygen-vacancy pairs with a partially filled level close
to the ZnO conduction band minimum. The magnetic interaction between these
pairs is sufficiently long-ranged to cause percolation at moderate
concentrations. However, magnetically correlated clusters large enough to show
hysteresis at room temperature already form below the percolation threshold and
explain the current experimental findings. Our work demonstrates that the
magnetism in ZnO:Co is entirely governed by intrinsic defects and a phase
diagram is presented. This suggests a recipe for tailoring the magnetic
properties of spintronics materials by controlling their intrinsic defects.

a recoiling, hard, massive, probably eccentric binary. I review the debate

are accelerated to high energies in the rapidly expanding shockwaves created by
powerful supernova explosions. Yet observational proof of this conjecture is
still lacking. Recently, Uchiyama and collaborators reported the detection of
small-scale X-ray flares in one such supernova remnant, dubbed 'RX J1713-3946'
(a.k.a. G347.3-0.5), which also emits very energetic, TeV (10^12 eV) range,
gamma-rays. They contend that the variability of these X-ray 'hotspots' implies
that the magnetic field in the remnant is about a hundred times larger than
normally assumed; and this, they say, means that the detected TeV range photons
were produced in energetic nuclear interactions, providing 'a strong argument
for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1 PeV (10^15 eV) and
beyond in young supernova remnants.' We point out here that the existing
multiwavelength data on this object certainly do not support such conclusions.
Though intriguing, the small-scale X-ray flares are not the long sought-after
'smoking gun' of nucleonic CR acceleration in SNRs.

resolved objects (such as M82, M51, 30 Doradus, M17 and the Orion Bar), as well

between these bands and the 11.3 micron band varies by one order of magnitude.
This implies that the properties of the PAHs are remarkably universal

mainly controled by the fraction of ionized PAHs. In particular, we show that
we can rule out both the modification of the PAH size distribution, and the

that such locally anisotropic structures can be modelled equivalently on

Finsler, configurations on the same manifold. Such canonical transforms are
defined by the coefficients of a prime metric and generate target spaces as

  4.13",,,,"math.GT math.AT math.GN",,"  We define Peano covering maps and prove basic properties analogous to
classical covers. Their domain is always locally path-connected but the range
may be an arbitrary topological space. One of characterizations of Peano
covering maps is via the uniqueness of homotopy lifting property for all
locally path-connected spaces.
  Regular Peano covering maps over path-connected spaces are shown to be
identical with generalized regular covering maps introduced by Fischer and
Zastrow. If $X$ is path-connected, then every Peano covering map is equivalent
to the projection $\widetilde X/H\to X$, where $H$ is a subgroup of the
fundamental group of $X$ and $\widetilde X$ equipped with the basic topology.
The projection $\widetilde X/H\to X$ is a Peano covering map if and only if it
has the unique path lifting property. We define a new topology on $\widetilde
X$ for which one has a characterization of $\widetilde X/H\to X$ having the
unique path lifting property if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\pi_1(X)$. Namely,
$H$ must be closed in $\pi_1(X)$. Such groups include $\pi(\mathcal{U},x_0)$
($\mathcal{U}$ being an open cover of $X$) and the kernel of the natural
homomorphism from the fundamental group to the Cech fundamental group.

the dependence of SFR on clustering through the morphology-density relation. We

late times. Seven of the eleven brightest satellites of the MW may have been
part of this system. The proximity of some dwarfs to the plane of the orbit of
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been used to argue that they formed from
tidal debris from the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Instead, they may
owe to the tidal breakup of the Magellanic Group. This can explain the
association of many of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group with the LMC
system. It provides a mechanism for lighting up dwarf galaxies and reproduces
the bright end of the cumulative circular velocity distribution of the
satellites in the MW without invoking a stripping scenario for the subhalos to
match the satellite distribution expected according to CDM theory. Finally, our
model predicts that other isolated dwarfs will be found to have companions.
Evidence for this prediction is provided by nearby, recently discovered dwarf
associations.

has a redder continuum than the other two images which can be explained by
differential extinction or microlensing. We also identify several lensed arcs.
Our observations suggest a complicated structure of the lens cluster at z~0.6.
We argue that the three lensed images are produced by a naked cusp on the basis
of successful mass models, the distribution of cluster member galaxies, and the
shapes and locations of the lensed arcs. Lensing by a naked cusp is quite rare
among galaxy-scale lenses but is predicted to be common among large-separation
lensed quasars. Thus the discovery can be viewed as support for an important
theoretical prediction of the standard cold dark matter model.

lensing mass reconstructions of galaxy clusters. Traditionally, most methods
have employed either a finite inversion or gridding to turn observational
lensed galaxy ellipticities into an estimate of the surface mass density of a
galaxy cluster. We approach the problem from a different perspective, motivated
by the success of multi-scale analysis in smoothed particle hydrodynamics. In
PBL, we treat each of the lensed galaxies as a particle and then reconstruct
the potential by smoothing over a local kernel with variable smoothing scale.
In this way, we can tune a reconstruction to produce constant signal-noise
throughout, and maximally exploit regions of high information density.
  PBL is designed to include all lensing observables, including multiple image
positions and fluxes from strong lensing, as well as weak lensing signals
including shear and flexion. In this paper, however, we describe a shear-only
reconstruction, and apply the method to several test cases, including simulated
lensing clusters, as well as the well-studied ``Bullet Cluster'' (1E0657-56).
In the former cases, we show that PBL is better able to identify cusps and
substructures than are grid-based reconstructions, and in the latter case, we
show that PBL is able to identify substructure in the Bullet Cluster without
even exploiting strong lensing measurements. We also make our codes publicly
available.

is non-magnetic and insulating at all temperatures. Low field dc magnetization
and ac susceptibility measurements reveal the presence of a transition at

ordering/freezing transitions at 62, 46 and 36 K in the case of Gd0.7Ba0.3MnO3,
the last one being more prominent. The nature of the field dependence of the
magnetization, combined with the slow magnetic relaxation, ageing and memory
effects, suggests that Nd0.7Ba0.3MnO3 is a cluster glass below 150 K, a
situation similar to that found for La_{1-x}SrxCoO3. Gd0.7Ba0.3MnO3, however,
shows non-equilibrium dynamics characteristic of spin glasses, below 36 K. The
difference in nature of the glassy behavior between Gd0.7Ba0.3MnO3 and
Nd0.7Ba0.3MnO3 probably arises because of the larger disorder arising from the
mismatch between the sizes of the A-site cations in the former. Our results on
Nd0.7Ba0.3MnO3 and Gd0.7Ba0.3MnO3 suggest that the magnetic insulating states
often reported for rare earth manganates of the type Ln1-xAxMnO3 (Ln = rare

behavior.

Though the center-of-mass energy $E_{CM}$ of `anything' varies unpredictably at
a hadron collider, a sample of many events nonetheless expresses features of
threshold production $E_{CM} = m_A + m_B + ...$: invariant masses constructed
from the final jet and lepton momenta are correlated in a way that makes their
threshold endpoints visually obvious in a scatterplot. We illustrate this
technique for the production of two neutralinos in the MSSM: $anything \to
\widetilde{\chi}_{i}^0 \widetilde{\chi}_{j}^0$ ($i,j=2,3,4$) which subsequently
decay via on- or off-shell sleptons to four leptons. Assuming the relevant SUSY

our MC study shows that one low-luminosity year at the LHC ($10-30 fb^{-1}$)
can quantitatively determine on- versus off-shell decays and find the relevant

mergers, we revisit previous studies of cosmological black hole spin evolution.
We show that mergers are very unlikely to yield large spins, unless alignment
of the spins of the merging holes with the orbital angular momentum is very
efficient. We analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spin
evolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolonged
accretion episodes, (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic)
accretion episodes. We study how different diagnostics can distinguish between
these evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power of
gravitational-wave measurements and X-ray spectroscopy. Gravitational radiation
can produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding respectively
the spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spin
of the merger remnant (as encoded in the ringdown waves), and the spin of
``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact
objects. The latter spin population is also accessible to iron-line
measurements. We compute and compare the spin distributions relevant for these
different observations. If iron-line measurements and gravitational-wave
observations of EMRIs only yield dimensionless spins j=J/M^2>0.9, then
prolonged accretion should be responsible for spin-up, and chaotic accretion
scenarios would be very unlikely. If only a fraction of the whole population of
low-redshift black holes spins rapidly, spin-alignment during binary mergers
(rather than prolonged accretion) could be responsible for spin-ups.

novel kind of non-linear integral equation (NLIE). The latter can be derived
under typical situations of the SYM sectors, i.e. when the scattering need not

lie on a bounded range. Here the non-linear (finite range) integral terms,
appearing in the NLIE and in the dimension formula, go to zero as $s\to

thus implying a linear integral equation (LIE) and a linear dimension/charge
formula respectively, likewise the 'thermodynamic' (i.e. infinite spin) case.
Importantly, these non-linear terms go faster than any inverse logarithm power
$(\ln s)^{-n}$, $n>0$, thus extending the linearity validity.

gravitational action with a cosmological constant and a gravitational coupling
constant. Then, by a scale transformation, through a dilaton field, we obtain a
new action containing cosmological and gravitational coupling terms which are
dynamically dependent on the dilaton field with Higgs type potential. The
vacuum expectation value of this dilaton field, through spontaneous symmetry
breaking on the basis of anthropic principle, determines the time variations of
$G$ and $\Lambda$. The relevance of these time variations to the current
acceleration of the universe, coincidence problem, Mach's cosmological
coincidence and those problems of standard cosmology addressed by inflationary
models, are discussed. The current acceleration of the universe is shown to be
a result of phase transition from radiation toward matter dominated eras. No
real coincidence problem between matter and vacuum energy densities exists in
this model and this apparent coincidence together with Mach's cosmological
coincidence are shown to be simple consequences of a new kind of scale factor
dependence of the energy momentum density as $\rho \sim a^{-4}$. This model
also provides the possibility for a super fast expansion of the scale factor at
very early universe by introducing exotic type matter like cosmic strings.

from cancer to healthy cell takes along the harmful information of cancerous
cell, propagating its toxic action to healthy tissues. We demonstrate that a
low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field or ultrasound irradiation
may increase the entropy production rate of a cell in normal tissue than that

paper, we study the subsequent evolution of a super Earth (m_1) under the
effects of tidal dissipation and perturbation from a first-born gas giant (m_2)
in an outside orbit. Secular perturbation and mean motion resonances
(especially 2:1 and 5:2 resonances) between m_1 and m_2 excite the eccentricity
of m_1, which causes the migration of m_1 and results in a hot super Earth. The
calculated final location of the hot super Earth is independent of the tidal
energy dissipation factor Q'. The study of migration history of a Hot Super
Earth is useful to reveal its Q' value and to predict its final location in the

theory for the well known (reverse) Brazil nut segregation in a vibro-fluidized
granular mixture. Using an analogy with standard fluid mechanics, we have
recently suggested a novel mechanism of segregation in granular mixtures based
on a {\it competition between buoyancy and geometric forces}: the Archimedean
buoyancy force, a pseudo-thermal buoyancy force due to the difference between
the energies of two granular species, and two geometric forces, one compressive
and the other-one tensile in nature, due to the size-difference. For a mixture
of perfectly hard-particles with elastic collisions, the pseudo-thermal
buoyancy force is zero but the intruder has to overcome the net compressive
geometric force to rise. For this case, the geometric force competes with the
standard Archimedean buoyancy force to yield a threshold density-ratio,
$R_{\rho 1}=\rho_l/\rho_s < 1$, above which the {\it lighter intruder sinks},
thereby signalling the {\it onset} of the {\it reverse buoyancy} effect. For a
mixture of dissipative particles, the non-zero pseudo-thermal buoyancy force
gives rise to another threshold density-ratio, $R_{\rho 2}$ ($> R_{\rho 1}$),
above which the intruder rises again. Focussing on the {\it tracer} limit of
intruders in a dense binary mixture, we find that the rise-time of the intruder
could vary {\it non-monotonically} with the density-ratio. For a given
size-ratio, there is a threshold density-ratio for the intruder at which it
takes the maximum time to rise, and above(/below) which it rises faster,
implying that {\it the heavier (and larger) the intruder, the faster it
ascends}. Our theory offers a unified description for the (reverse) Brazil-nut

naturally defined. Under certain hypothesis we show the existence of a explicit
``attracting'' fixed point $V^*$ for $\mathcal{R} $. We call $\mathcal{R}$ the
renormalization operator which acts on potentials $V$. The log of the
derivative of the main branch of the Manneville-Pomeau map appears as a special
``attracting'' fixed point for the local doubling period renormalization
operator. We also consider an analogous definition for the one-sided 2-full
shift $\S$ (and also for the two-sided shift) and we obtain a similar result.
Then, we consider global properties and we prove two rigidity results. Up to
some weak assumptions, we get the uniqueness for the renormalization operator
in the shift. In the last section we show (via a certain continuous fraction
expansion) a natural relation of the two settings: shift acting on the
Bernoulli space $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ and Manneville-Pomeau-like map acting on

weights on an abstract model index and a prior on a density model for each

which the rate of contraction is the one attached to the model that best

glueball spectrum with accuracy. Like other effective approaches of QCD,
potential models still have difficulties to cope with gluonic hadrons. Assuming
that glueballs are bound states of valence gluons with zero current mass, it is
readily understood that the use of a potential model, intrinsically non
covariant, could be problematic in this case. The main challenge for this kind
of model is actually to find a way to introduce properly the more relevant
degree of freedom of the gluon: spin or helicity. In this work, we use the
so-called helicity formalism of Jacob and Wick to describe two-gluon glueballs.
We show in particular that this helicity formalism exactly reproduces the
$J^{PC}$ numbers which are observed in lattice QCD when the constituent gluons
have a helicity-1, without introducing extra states as it is the case in most
of the potential models. These extra states appear when gluons are seen as
spin-1 particles. Using a simple spinless Salpeter model with Cornell potential
within the helicity formalism, we obtain a glueball mass spectrum which is in
good agreement with lattice QCD predictions for helicity-1 gluons provided
instanton-induced interactions are taken into account.

the relatively rapid evolution of the polar plumes. We demonstrate that it is
possible to take into account this temporal evolution in the reconstruction.
The difficulty of this problem comes from the fact that we want a 4D
reconstruction (three spatial dimensions plus time) while we only have 3D data
(2D images plus time). To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a model that
describes polar plumes as stationary objects whose intensity varies
homogeneously with time. This assumption can be physically justified if one
accepts the stability of the magnetic structure. This model leads to a bilinear
inverse problem. We describe how to extend linear inversion methods to these
kinds of problems. Studies of simulations show the reliability of our method.
Results for SOHO/EIT data show that we are able to estimate the temporal
evolution of polar plumes in order to improve the reconstruction of the solar
poles from only one point of view. We expect further improvements from
STEREO/EUVI data when the two probes will be separated by about 60 degrees.

quiet-Sun regions (QS), but can hardly be distinguished in most chromospheric
and lower transition region lines. A key quantity for the understanding of this
phenomenon is the magnetic field. We use data from SOHO/MDI to reconstruct the
magnetic field in coronal holes and the quiet Sun with the help of a potential
magnetic model. Starting from a regular grid on the solar surface we then trace
field lines, which provide the overall geometry of the 3D magnetic field
structure. We distinguish between open and closed field lines, with the closed
field lines being assumed to represent magnetic loops. We then try to compute
some properties of coronal loops. The loops in the coronal holes (CH) are found
to be on average flatter than in the QS. High and long closed loops are
extremely rare, whereas short and low-lying loops are almost as abundant in
coronal holes as in the quiet Sun. When interpreted in the light of loop
scaling laws this result suggests an explanation for the relatively strong
chromospheric and transition region emission (many low-lying, short loops), but
the weak coronal emission (few high and long loops) in coronal holes. In spite
of this contrast our calculations also suggest that a significant fraction of
the cool emission in CHs comes from the open flux regions. Despite these
insights provided by the magnetic field line statistics further work is needed
to obtain a definite answer to the question if loop statistics explain the
differences between coronal holes and the quiet Sun.

give a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very
simple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for
real-time applications often found on board space mission. We introduce a
practical and effective recovery algorithm for decoding compressed data. In
astronomy, physical prior information is often crucial for devising effective
signal processing methods. We particularly point out that a CS-based
compression scheme is flexible enough to account for such information. In this
context, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and
data processing are merged. We show also that CS provides a new fantastic way
to handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover

standard compression methods. This CS data fusion concept could lead to an

Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on the SOHO spacecraft. Polar coronal holes at
solar minimum are known to exhibit broad line widths and unusual intensity
ratios of the O VI 1032, 1037 emission line doublet. The traditional
interpretation of these features has been that oxygen ions have a strong
temperature anisotropy, with the temperature perpendicular to the magnetic
field being much larger than the temperature parallel to the field. However,
recent work by Raouafi and Solanki suggested that it may be possible to model
the observations using an isotropic velocity distribution. In this paper we
analyze an expanded data set to show that the original interpretation of an
anisotropic distribution is the only one that is fully consistent with the
observations. It is necessary to search the full range of ion plasma parameters
to determine the values with the highest probability of agreement with the UVCS
data. The derived ion outflow speeds and perpendicular kinetic temperatures are
consistent with earlier results, and there continues to be strong evidence for
preferential ion heating and acceleration with respect to hydrogen. At
heliocentric heights above 2.1 solar radii, every UVCS data point is more
consistent with an anisotropic distribution than with an isotropic
distribution. At heights above 3 solar radii, the exact probability of isotropy
depends on the electron density chosen to simulate the line-of-sight
distribution of O VI emissivity. (abridged abstract)

similar to the ones we previously proposed for Wannier excitons. They allow us
to calculate any physical quantity dealing with $N$ excitons in terms of ""Pauli
scatterings"" for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction and
""interaction scatterings"" for carrier interaction in the absence of carrier
exchange. We show that Frenkel excitons have a novel ""transfer assisted
exchange scattering"", specific to these excitons. It comes from indirect
Coulomb processes between localized atomic states. These indirect processes,
commonly called ""electron-hole exchange"" in the case of Wannier excitons and
most often neglected, are crucial for Frenkel excitons, as they are the only
ones responsible for the excitation transfer. We also show that in spite of the
fact that Frenkel excitons are made of electrons and holes on the same atomic
site, so that we could naively see them as elementary particles, they
definitely are composite objects, their composite nature appearing through
various properties, not always easy to guess. The present many-body theory for
Frenkel excitons is thus going to appear as highly valuable to securely tackle
their many-body physics, as in the case of nonlinear optical effects in organic
semiconductors.

results in the emission of odd-harmonics of $\omega$ (""IR harmonics"") up to

which were absent in the spectra in the presence of the IR field alone. The
mechanism responsible for the appearance of the XUV harmonics is analyzed
analytically using a generalization of the semiclassical re-collision
(three-step) model of high harmonic generation. It is shown that the emitted
HHG radiation field can be written as a serie of terms, with the HHG field
obtained from the three-step model in its most familiar context [P. B. Corkum,
\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 71}, 1994 (1993)] resulting from the
zeroth-order term. The origin of the higher-order terms is shown to be the
ac-Stark oscillations of the remaining ground electronic state which are
induced by the XUV field. These terms are responsible for the appearance of the
new XUV harmonics in the HGS. The XUV harmonics are formed by the same electron
trajectories which form the IR harmonics and have the same emission times, but
a much lower intensity than the IR harmonics, due to the small quiver amplitude
of the ac-Stark oscillation. Nevertheless, this mechanism allows the extension
of the cut-off in the HGS without the necessity of increasing the IR field
intensity, as is verified by numerical time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation
simulation of a Xe atom shined by a combination of IR and XUV field.

as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). We determine the redshifts

  METHODS. We obtained multi-object mask spectroscopy using the FORS2
instrument at the VLT. We reduced the data with particular attention to the sky
subtraction. We implemented the method of Kelson for performing sky subtraction
prior to any rebinning/interpolation of the data. From the measured galaxy
redshifts, we determine cluster velocity dispersions using the biweight
estimator and test for possible substructure in the clusters using the
Dressler-Shectman test.
  RESULTS. The method of subtracting the sky prior to any
rebinning/interpolation of the data delivers photon-noise-limited results,
whereas the traditional method of subtracting the sky after the data have been
rebinned/interpolated results in substantially larger noise for spectra from
tilted slits. Redshifts for individual galaxies are presented and redshifts and
velocity dispersions are presented for 21 galaxy clusters. For the 9 clusters

spectroscopic velocity dispersions are now available for 26 EDisCS clusters

with randomly chosen amplitudes, from anticommutation relations, or from the
requirement that any polarisation vector is less than unity. The most powerful

crossed channels, with a projection to single out correlations between two or
