reduce PDF uncertainties in predictions for single-top quark and Higgs boson
production in the standard model and minimal supersymmetric standard model.

""Maximum Agreement SubTree"" problem (MAST) consists of finding a subtree

interest in computational biology, where trees encountered have often small

  In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of MAST and MCT with
respect to the maximum degree, denoted by D, of the input trees. It is known
that MAST is polynomial for bounded D. As a counterpart, we show that the
problem is W[1]-hard with respect to parameter D. Moreover, relying on recent
advances in parameterized complexity we obtain a tight lower bound: while MAST
can be solved in O(N^{O(D)}) time where N denotes the input length, we show
that an O(N^{o(D)}) bound is not achievable, unless SNP is contained in SE. We
also show that MCT is W[1]-hard with respect to D, and that MCT cannot be
solved in O(N^{o(2^{D/2})}) time, SNP is contained in SE.

Background (CMB) anisotropies from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe

adopted a redshift distribution of NVSS sources inconsistent with recent data.
We find that the constraints on the bias-weighted redshift distribution,
b(z)xN(z), of NVSS sources, set by the observed angular correlation function,
w(theta), strongly mitigate the effect of the choice of N(z). If such
constraints are met, even highly discrepant redshift distributions yield
NVSS-WMAP cross-correlation functions consistent with each other within
statistical errors. The models favoured by recent data imply a bias factor,
b(z), decreasing with increasing z, rather than constant, as assumed by most
previous analyses. As a consequence, the function b(z)xN(z) has more weight at
z<1, i.e. in the redshift range yielding the maximum contribution to the ISW in
a standard LambdaCDM cosmology. On the whole, the NVSS turns out to be better
suited for ISW studies than generally believed, even in the absence of an
observational determination of the redshift distribution. The NVSS-WMAP
cross-correlation function is found to be fully consistent with the prediction
of the standard LambdaCDM cosmology.

evolution paths and very different properties. I review two types of `bulges',
the boxy/peanut bulges (B/Ps) and the discy bulges. The former are parts of
bars seen edge-on, have their origin in vertical instabilities of the disc and
are somewhat shorter in extent than bars. Their stellar population is similar
to that of the inner part of the disc from which they formed. Discy bulges have
a disc-like outline, i.e., seen face-on they are circular or oval and seen
edge-on they are thin. Their extent is of the order of 5 times smaller than
that of the boxy/peanut bulges. They form from the inflow of mainly gaseous
material to the centre of the galaxy and from subsequent star formation. They
thus contain a lot of young stars and gas. Bulges of different types often
coexist in the same galaxy. I review the main known results on these two types
of bulges and present new simulation results. B/Ps form about 1Gyr after the
bar, via a vertical buckling. At that time the bar strength decreases, its
inner part becomes thicker -- forming the peanut or boxy shape -- and the ratio
$\sigma_z^2/\sigma_r^2$ increases. A second buckling episode is seen in
simulations with strong bars, also accompanied by a thickening of the peanut
and a weakening of the bar. The properties of the B/Ps correlate strongly with
those of the bar: stronger bars have stronger peanuts, a more flat-topped
vertical density distribution and have experienced more bucklings. I also
present simulations of disc galaxy formation, which include the formation of a
discy bulge. Decomposition of their radial density profile into an exponential
disc and a Sersic bulge gives realistic values for the disc and bulge
scale-lengths and mass ratios, and a Sersic shape index of the order of 1.

model it is assumed that for ~10 weeks near periastron passages one star is
accreting mass from the slow dense wind blown by the other star. We find that
the secondary, the less massive star, accretes ~2x10^{-6}Mo. This mass
possesses enough angular momentum to form a disk, or a belt, around the
secondary. The viscous time is too long for the establishment of equilibrium,
and the belt must be dissipated as its mass is being blown in the reestablished
secondary wind. This processes requires about half a year, which we identify
with the recovery phase of Eta Carinae. We show that radiation pressure, termed
radiative braking, cannot prevent accretion. In addition to using the commonly
assumed binary model for Eta Carinae, we also examine alternative models where
the stellar masses are larger, and/or the less massive secondary blows the slow
dense wind, while the primary blows the tenuous fast wind and accretes mass for

precession of Mercury's orbit announced in 1859 by Le Verrier, the general
theory of relativity proposed by Einstein in November 1915, alone could
calculate Mercury's 'anomalous' precession with a precision demanded by
observational accuracy. Since Mercury's precession was a directly derived
result of the full general theory, it was viewed by Einstein as the most
critical test of general relativity, amongst the three tests proposed by him.
With the advent of the space age, the observational accuracy level has improved
further and it became possible to detect this precession for other planetary
orbits of the solar system -- viz., Venus and the Earth. This conclusively
proved that the phenomenon of 'anomalous' perihelion precession of planetary
orbits is really a relativistic effect. Our previous papers presented the
mathematical model and the computed value of the relativistic perihelion
precession of Mercury's orbit using an alternate relativistic gravitational
model, which is a remodeled form of Einstein's relativity theories, and which
retained only experimentally proven principles and has been enriched by the
benefits of almost a century-long relativity experimentation including the
space age experiments. Using this model, we present in this paper the computed
values of the relativistic precession of Venus and the Earth, which compare
well with the predictions of general relativity and also are in agreement with
the observed values within the range of uncertainty.

the J0737-3039 system is very soft, and not satisfactorily modeled by a simple
blackbody or an atmospheric model. However, it is not possible yet to
discriminate between a predominantly non-thermal and a predominantly thermal
origin for the X-ray emission. Adopting a simple power-law emission model, the
photon index (Gamma=3.7) and the implied conversion efficiency of the
rotational energy of PSR J0737-3039A into X-ray emission (4.1x10^-4, for a
distance to the source of 500 pc) are compatible with the X-ray photons being
emitted in the magnetosphere of PSR J0737-3039A. This hypothesis is also
supported by the absence of detectable X-ray orbital modulation (up to ~20%) or
any X-ray nebular emission and it is in agreement with the high (~75%) X-ray
pulsed fraction of PSR J0737-3039A. A two blackbody or a Comptonized blackbody
model also reproduce the data, and the upper limit to the value of the hydrogen
column density N_H <10^20 cm^-2, is in better agreement (with respect to the
power-law model) with the Galactic N_H in that direction and at that distance.
For the two blackbody model the implied emission radii and temperatures are
also compatible with those seen in other recycled pulsars, calling for the bulk
of the X-ray photons being originated from heated regions at the surface of
pulsar A. On the other hand, in the Comptonized blackbody model, the electron
temperature seems to be significantly smaller than in other similar objects.

surface. The surface migration energy for adsorbed O ions is found to be quite
high, 1.6 eV. We predict that the adsorbed O atoms could penetrate into
electrode first plane when much more mobile surface oxygen vacancies (migration
energy of 0.69 eV) approach the O ions strongly bound to the surface Mn ions.
Ab initio thermodynamics predicts that at typical SOFC operation temperatures
(~1200 K) the MnO2 (001) surface with adsorbed O atoms is the most stable in a
very wide range of oxygen gas pressures (above 10^2 atm).

their application to the computation of separability probabilities for the

our recent work (arXiv:0704.3723), in which the Dyson indices of random matrix
theory played an essential role, to include the use of not only the volume
element of the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) metric, but also that of the Bures (minimal
monotone) metric as measures over these finite-dimensional quantum systems.
Further, we now employ the Euler-angle parameterization of density matrices
(rho), in addition to the Bloore parameterization. The Euler-angle separability
function for the minimally degenerate complex two-qubit states is well-fitted
by the sixth-power of the participation ratio, R(rho)=1/Tr(rho)^2.
Additionally, replacing R(rho) by a simple linear transformation of the
Verstraete-Audenaert-De Moor function (arXiv:quant-oh/0011111), we find close
adherence to Dyson-index behavior for the real and complex (nondegenerate)
two-qubit scenarios. Several of the analyses reported help to fortify our
conjectures that the HS and Bures separability probabilities of the complex
two-qubit states are 8/33 = 0.242424 and 1680 (sqrt{2}-1)/pi^8 = 0.733389,
respectively. Employing certain regularized beta functions in the role of
Euler-angle separability functions, we closely reproduce--consistently with the
Dyson-index ansatz--several HS two-qubit separability probability conjectures.

self-consistently through collapse of magnetized hypermassive neutron stars to
black holes. Such stars can arise following the merger of binary neutron stars.
They are differentially rotating, dynamically stable, and have rest masses
exceeding the mass limit for uniform rotation. However, hypermassive neutron
stars are secularly unstable to collapse due to MHD-driven angular momentum
transport. The rotating black hole which forms in this process is surrounded by
a hot, massive, magnetized torus and a magnetic field collimated along the spin
axis. This system is a candidate for the central engine of a short-hard
gamma-ray burst (GRB). Our code integrates the coupled Einstein-Maxwell-MHD
equations and is used to follow the collapse of magnetized hypermassive neutron
star models in full general relativity until the spacetime settles down to a
quasi-stationary state. We then employ the Cowling approximation, in which the
spacetime is frozen, to track the subsequent evolution of the disk. This
approximation allows us to greatly extend the disk evolutions and study the
resulting outflows, which may be relevant to the generation of a GRB. We find
that outflows are suppressed when a stiff equation of state is assumed for low
density disk material and are sensitive to the initial magnetic field
configuration.

and temperature structures of the MHD simulations are mapped on to the
radiative transfer grid, and corresponding line source function and the
observed profiles of neutral hydrogen lines (H-beta, Pa-beta and Br-gamma) are
computed using the Sobolev escape probability method. We study the dependency
of line variability on inclination angles (i) and magnetic axis misalignment
angles (Theta). By comparing our models with the Pa-beta profiles of 42 CTTS
observed by Folha & Emerson, we find that models with a smaller misaligngment
angle (Theta<~15 deg.) are more consistent with the observations which show
that majority of Pa-beta are rather symmetric around the line centre. For a
high inclination system with a small dipole misalignment angle (Theta ~ 15
deg.), only one accretion funnel (on the upper hemisphere) is visible to an
observer at any given rotational phase. This can cause an anti-correlation of
the line equivalent width in the blue wing (v<0) and that in the red wing (v>0)
over a half of a rotational period, and a positive correlation over other half.
We find a good overall agreement of the line variability behaviour predicted by
our model and those from observations. (Abridged)

with locally persistent dark intergranular holes and/or with the presence of
quasi-regular structures. The suggestion that the random field (4) successfully

be declined.

supernova remnant of Cas A by the Spitzer satellite has provided astronomers
with a unique opportunity to study the properties of the echoing material and
the history and nature of the outburst that generated these echoes.
  All the echoes located within a distance of ~15 arcmin from the SN are caused
by the delayed arrival of thermal emission from dust located at a distance of
160 lyr (corresponding to half the adopted age of the remnant) directly behind
the origin of the explosion. The spectra of the echoes are distinct from that
of the general diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) revealing hot silicate grains
that are either stochastically heated to temperatures in excess of ~150 K, or
radiating at an equilibrium temperature of this value. We show that the optical
light curve from the supernova, is not capable of producing such spectra, and
could therefore not have given rise to the echoes. Instead, we find that the
echoes were generated by an intense and short burst of EUV-UV radiation with a
luminosity of ~ 1.5E11 Lsun. The average H-column density of the IR emitting
region in the echoing clouds is about 5E17 cm-2. Taking a burst time of ~1 d
gives a cloud density of ~200 cm-3, typical of dense IR cirrus.

The inflaton potential is naturally flat due to shift symmetries, and in the

The model agrees with WMAP3 measurements as long as $f > 0.7 m_{Pl}$ (where

the scalar spectral index is shown to be small -- an order of magnitude below

perturbations on observable scales are produced is examined; for $f > 5

quadratic, yet has the advantage that the required flatness is well-motivated.

simple scenarios for explaining the observed Ly-a and rest-frame UV luminosity
functions (LFs) of LAEs: (i) the ""escape fraction"" scenario, in which the
""effective"" escape fraction (including the IGM attenuation) of Ly-a photons is
f_Lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the ""stochastic"" scenario, in which the
fraction of LAEs that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \Cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) after
correcting for the IGM attenuation. Our comparisons with a number of different
observations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escape
fraction scenario. We find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicity
and black hole mass hosted by LAEs are all smaller in the stochastic scenario
than in the escape fraction scenario. In our simulations, the galaxy stellar
mass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation.
However, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in the
specific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frame
UV LF from z=6 to 3. The rest-frame UV LF of both LAEs and LBGs at z=3 & 6 can
be described well by the stochastic scenario provided the extinction is
moderate, E(B-V) ~0.15, for both populations, although our simulation might be
overpredicting the number of bright LBGs at z=6. We also discuss the
correlation function and bias of LAEs. The Ly-a LFs at z=6 in a field-of-view
of 0.2 deg^2 show a significantly larger scatter owing to cosmic variance
relative to that in a 1 deg^2 field, and the scatter seen in the current
observational estimates of the Ly-a LF can be accounted for by cosmic variance.

interaction between charged particles: carriers (electrons and holes) and ions.
These include carrier-carrier or carrier-ion scattering, energy and momentum
transfer (including the drag effect), thermal equilibration, exciton formation,
impact ionization, Auger effects, etc. It is not widely recognized that these

including catalytic reactions. Here, we propose a general and powerful theory
of the plasmonic enhancement of the many-body phenomena resulting in a closed

this theory by computing this dressed interaction explicitly for an important
example of metal-dielectric nanoshells, which exhibits a reach resonant
behavior in both the magnitude and phase. This interaction is used to describe
the nanoplasmonic-enhanced Foerster energy transfer between nanocrystal quantum
dots in the proximity of a plasmonic nanoshell. Catalysis at nanostructured

scattering are discussed among other effects and applications where the
nanoplasmonic renormalization of the Coulomb interaction may be of principal

  with experimental validation",,,,,"physics.class-ph",,"  This paper presents an analytical model of punctual elastic contact between a
rigid body of arbitrary geometry and a plane surface. A simple analytical model
is developed in order to evaluate the contact force knowing the volume of
interpenetration, the surface and the perimeter of the base of this volume and
the mechanical characteristics of surfaces in contact. Analytical and
experimental validations are made for this model in the case of simple shapes
(spherical, conical and pyramidal). Next, an approach for the resolution in
case of contact between a rigid body and a viscoelastic plane is presented. The
elastic constants are replaced by an integral operator corresponding to the
viscoelastic stress-strain relation. At last, the viscoelastic punctual contact
is studied analytically and validated experimentally.

proposed and the corresponding detecting algorithm is given. A community is
defined as a set of nodes, which satisfy that each node's degree inside the
community should not be smaller than the node's degree toward any other
community. In the algorithm, the attractive force of a community to a node is
defined as the connections between them. Then employing attractive force based
self-organizing process, without any extra parameter, the best communities can
be detected. Several artificial and real-world networks, including Zachary
Karate club network and College football network are analyzed. The algorithm
works well in detecting communities and it also gives a nice description for
network division and group formation.

subsystem coupled to a solid are studied theoretically by the example of
deformation phonons. Expressions for the reduced density matrix at T=0 are
derived beyond the Markovian approximation by means of explicit solution of the
non-stationary Schrodinger equation for the interacting electron-phonon system
at the initial stage of its evolution. It is shown that as long as the
difference between the energies of the electron in the left and the right well
greatly exceeds the energy of the electron tunneling between the minima of the
double-well potential, decoherence is primarily due to dephasing processes.
This case corresponds to a strongly asymmetric potential and spatially
separated eigenfunctions localized in the vicinity of one or another potential
minimum. In the opposite case of the symmetric potential, the decoherence stems
from the relaxation processes, which may be either ""resonant"" (at relatively
long times) or ""nonresonant"" (at short times), giving rise to qualitatively
different temporal evolution of the electron state. The results obtained are
discussed in the context of quantum information processing based on the quantum
bits encoded in electron charge degrees of freedom.

whose ``null'' pulses bunch at periodic intervals of around 57 times the
rotation period. The emission bursts between the null bunches exhibit
characteristic modulations at two shorter periodicities of approximately 6.2
and 3 times the rotation period, the former found largely in the two outer
components, and the latter only in the first component. Many bursts commence
with bright emission in second component, exhibit positive six-period drift
across the full profile width, and end with 3-period modulation in the leading
component. The 57-period cycle can be modelled geometrically as a sparsely
filled subbeam carousel with nulls appearing whenever our line of sight
intersects a circulating empty region. This interpretation is compatible with
other recent evidence for periodic, carousel-related nulling and appears to
support the physics of a polar-gap emission model for ``drifting'' subpulses,
but the subtle structure of the emission bursts defies an easy explanation.

significant radio variations, indicating the presence of polar BAL outflows. We
obtained snapshot XMM observations of four polar BAL QSOs, to check whether
strong X-ray absorption, one of the most prominent characteristics of most BAL
QSOs, also exist in polar outflows. Two of the sources are detected in X-ray.
Spectral fittings show that they are X-ray normal with no intrinsic X-ray
absorption, suggesting the X-ray shielding gas might be absent in polar BAL
outflows. Comparing to non-BAL QSOs, one of two X-ray nondetected sources
remains consistent with X-ray normal, while the other one, which is an iron
low-ionization BAL (FeLoBAL), shows an X-ray weakness factor of > 19,
suggesting strong intrinsic X-ray absorption. Alternative explanations to the
nondetection of strong X-ray absorption in the two X-ray detected sources are
1) the absorption is more complex than a simple neutral absorber, such as
partial covering absorption or ionized absorption; 2) there might be
significant jet contribution to the detected X-ray emission. Current data is
insufficient to test these possibilities, and further observations are required
to understand the X-ray nature of polar BAL outflows.

providing information on the value of theta13, the type of neutrino mass

3-neutrino oscillations. Here, we consider a beta-beam setup with an
intermediate Lorentz factor gamma=450 and a baseline of 1050 km. This could be
achieved in Europe with a beta-beam sourced at CERN to a detector located at
the Boulby mine in the United Kingdom. We analyse the physics potential of this
setup in detail and study two different exposures (1 x 10^{21} and 5 x 10^{21}
ions-kton-years). In both cases, we find that the type of neutrino mass
hierarchy could be determined at 99% CL, for all values of delta, for sin^2(2
theta13) > 0.03. In the high-exposure scenario, we find that the value of the
CP-violating phase delta could be measured with a 99% CL error of ~20 deg if
sin^2 (2 theta13) > 10^{-3}, with some sensitivity down to values of sin^2(2
theta13) ~ 10^{-4}. The ability to determine the octant of theta23 is also
studied, and good prospects are found for the high-statistics scenario.
