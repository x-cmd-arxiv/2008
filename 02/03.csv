which are equivariant under the action of an algebraic group. We show that
equivariant primary decompositions exist if the group is connected. As main
application we consider the case of varieties which are quotients of a
quasi-affine variety by the action of a diagonalizable group and thus admit a
homogeneous coordinate ring, such as toric varieties. Comparing these
decompositions with primary decompositions of graded modules over the
homogeneous coordinate ring, we show that these are equivalent if the action of
the diagonalizable group is free. We give some specific examples for the case
of toric varieties.

In a splicing system, two strings to be spliced are taken from the same set and
the splicing rule is from another set. Here we propose a generalised splicing
(GS) model with three components, two strings from two languages and a splicing
rule from third component. We propose a generalised self assembly (GSA) of
strings. Two strings $u_1xv_1$ and $u_2xv_2$ self assemble over $x$ and
generate $u_1xv_2$ and $u_2xv_1$. We study the relationship between GS and GSA.
We study some classes of generalised splicing languages with the help of
generalised self assembly.

apprenticeship. Kepler's laws required Tycho's data. As the pace of discoveries
has increased over the centuries, so has the cadence of tutelage (literally,

hundreds, digital imaging a few decades, but today's undergraduates will use
instrumentation yet unbuilt - and thus, unfamiliar to their professors - to
complete their doctoral dissertations. Not only has the quickening cadence of
astronomical data-taking overrun the apprehension of the science within, but
the contingent pace of experimental design threatens our capacity to learn new
techniques and apply them productively. Virtual technologies are necessary to
accelerate our human processes of perception and comprehension to keep up with
astronomical instrumentation and pipelined dataflows. Necessary, but not
sufficient. Computers can confuse us as efficiently as they illuminate. Rather,
as with neural pathways evolved to meet competitive ecological challenges,
astronomical software and data must become organized into ever more coherent
""threads"" of execution. These are the same threaded constructs as understood by
computer science. No datum is an island.

cooling cores in X-ray galaxy clusters, we study how the physical properties
change as function of the cosmic time in the inner regions of a 4 keV and 8 keV
galaxy cluster under the action of radiative cooling and gravity only. The
cooling radius, R_cool, defined as the radius at which the cooling time equals
the Universe age at given redshift, evolves from ~0.01 R200 at z>2, where the
structures begin their evolution, to ~0.05 R200 at z=0. The values measured at
0.01 R200 show an increase of about 15-20 per cent per Gyr in the gas density
and surface brightness and a decrease with a mean rate of 10 per cent per Gyr
in the gas temperature. The emission-weighted temperature diminishes by about
25 per cent and the bolometric X-ray luminosity rises by a factor ~2 after 10
Gyrs when all the cluster emission is considered in the computation. On the
contrary, when the core region within 0.15 R500 is excluded, the gas
temperature value does not change and the X-ray luminosity varies by 10-20 per
cent only. The cooling time and gas entropy radial profiles are well
represented by power-law functions. The behaviour of the inner slopes of the
gas temperature and density profiles are the most sensitive and unambiguous
tracers of an evolving cooling core. Their values after 10 Gyrs of radiative
losses, T_gas ~ r^0.4 and n_gas ~ r^(-1.2) for the hot (cool) object, are
remarkably in agreement with the observational constraints available for nearby
X-ray luminous cooling core clusters. Because our simulations do not consider
any AGN heating, they imply that the feedback process does not greatly alter
the gas density and temperature profiles as generated by radiative cooling
alone.

for interaction range and thus it strictly fulfills the detailed balance. The
realized stochastic dynamics is equivalent to that of the conventional
Swendsen-Wang algorithm, which requires O(N^2) operations per Monte Carlo sweep
if applied to long-range interacting models. In addition, it is shown that the
total energy and the specific heat can also be measured in O(N) time. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm over the conventional method and
the O(N log N) algorithm by Luijten and Bloete. We also apply our algorithm to
the classical and quantum Ising chains with inverse-square ferromagnetic
interactions, and confirm in a high accuracy that a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition, associated with a universal jump in the magnetization, occurs in
both cases.
