equation for momentum (Newton's second law) taking due account of the vector
potential and its convective derivative. We obtain a development in terms of
retarded potentials allowing an intuitive physical interpretation of its main
terms. The inertial property of matter is then discussed in terms of a kind of
induction law related to the extended charged particle's own vector potential.
Moreover, it is obtained a force term that represents a drag force acting on
the charged particle when in motion relatively to its own vector potential
field lines. The time rate of variation of the particle's vector potential
leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force, equivalent to the Schott term
responsible for the source of the radiation field. We also show that the
velocity dependent term of the particle's vector potential is connected with
the relativistic increase of mass with velocity and generates a longitudinal
stress force that is the source of electric field lines deformation. In the
framework of classical electrodynamics, we have shown that the electron mass
has possibly a complete electromagnetic origin and the obtained covariant
equation solves the ""4/3 mass paradox"" for a spherical charge distribution.

such as Sederot from rockets, mortar shells, chemical and biological weapons.
The offered AB-Dome is also very useful in peacetime because it protects the
city from outside weather (violent storms, hail) and creates a fine climate
within the Dome. The roughly hemispherical AB-Dome is a gigantic inflated thin
transparent film, located at altitude up to 1 - 5 kilometers, which converts
the city into a closed-loop air system. The film may be armored with a basalt
or steel grille or cloth pocket-retained stones that destroy (by collision or
detonation) incoming rockets, shells and other projectiles. Such an AB-Dome
would even protect the city in case of a third-party nuclear war involving
temporary poisoning of the Earth atmosphere by radioactive dust. The building
of the offered dome is easy; the film spreads on the ground, the fan engines
turn on and the cover rises to the needed altitude and is supported there by a
small internal overpressure.
  The offered method is cheaper by thousands of times than protection of a city
by current anti-rocket systems. The AB-Dome may be also used (height is up to
1-5 and more kilometers) for TV, communication, long distance location,
tourism, suspended high speed and altitude windmills (energy), illumination and
entertainment (projected messages and pictures).

the equivalence between the action of a phonon field moving in a superfluid

Exploiting this analogy we obtain continuity equations for the phonon current,
entropy and energy-momentum tensor in a covariant form, valid in any reference
frame. Our aim is to shed light on some aspects of transport phenomena of
relativistic superfluidity. In particular, we are interested in the low

superconducting and superfluid phase of high density QCD that may be realized

asymptotic giant branch stars of 47 Tucanae. A more detailed investigation into
s-process element abundances throughout the colour-magnitude diagram of 47
Tucanae is vital in order to determine whether the observed enhancements are
intrinsic to the cluster. This paper explores this possibility through
observational and theoretical means. The visibility of s- and r-process element
lines in synthetic spectra of giant and dwarf stars throughout the colour
magnitude diagram of 47 Tucanae has been explored. It was determined that a
resolving power of 10 000 was sufficient to observe s-process element abundance
variations in globular cluster giant branch stars. These synthetic results were
compared with the spectra of eleven 47 Tucanae giant branch stars observed
during the performance verification of the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the
Southern African Large Telescope. Three s-process elements, Zr, Ba, Nd, and one
r-process element, Eu, were investigated. No abundance variations were found
such that [X/Fe] = 0.0 +/- 0.5 dex. It was concluded that this resolving power,
R ~ 5000, was not sufficient to obtain exact abundances but upper limits on the

analysed to study their coronal properties as a function of coronal activity
parameters Rossby number, $L_X/L_{bol}$ and a coronal temperature index. Plasma
emission measure distributions as a function of temperature show broad peaks at
T~10e7K. Differences between stars suggest that as supersaturation is reached
the DEM slope below the temperature of peak DEM becomes shallower, while the
DEM drop-off above this temperature becomes more pronounced. A larger sample
comprising our three targets and 22 active stars studied in the recent
literature reveals a general increase of plasma at T>10e7 toward the

supersaturated stars. All three of the stars studied in detail here show lower
coronal abundances of the low FIP elements Mg, Si and Fe, relative to the high

declining slowly with rising Lx/Lbol, but with a much more sharp decline at

circulation on HD 209458b and HD 189733b and calculate the infrared spectra and
light curves predicted by these simulations, which we compare with available
observations. Radiative heating/cooling is parameterized with a simplified
Newtonian relaxation scheme. Our simulations develop day-night temperature
contrasts that vary strongly with pressure. At low pressure (<10 mbar), air
flows from the substellar point toward the antistellar point, both along the
equator and over the poles. At deeper levels, the flow develops an eastward
equatorial jet with speeds of 3-4 km/sec, with weaker westward flows at high
latitudes. This basic flow pattern is robust to variations in model resolution,
gravity, radiative time constant, and initial temperature structure. Nightside
spectra show deep absorption bands of H2O, CO, and/or CH4, whereas on the
dayside these absorption bands flatten out or even flip into emission. This
results from the strong effect of dynamics on the vertical temperature-pressure
structure; the temperature decreases strongly with altitude on the nightside
but becomes almost isothermal on the dayside. In Spitzer bandpasses, our
predicted planet-to-star flux ratios vary by a factor of 2-10 with orbital
phase, depending on the wavelength and chemistry. For HD 189733b, where a
detailed 8-micron light curve has been obtained, we correctly produce the
observed phase offset of the flux maximum, but we do not explain the flux
minimum and we overpredict the total flux variation. This discrepancy likely
results from the simplifications inherent in the Newtonian relaxation scheme
and provides motivation for incorporating realistic radiative transfer in
future studies.

verifying a condition that involves only pairs of cards, then we use it to
obtain improved bounds for two previously studied models.
  E. Thorp introduced the following card shuffling model in 1973. Suppose the
number of cards n is even. Cut the deck into two equal piles. Drop the first
card from the left pile or from the right pile according to the outcome of a
fair coin flip. Then drop from the other pile. Continue this way until both
piles are empty. We obtain a mixing time bound of O(log^4 n). Previously, the
best known bound was O(log^{29} n) and previous proofs were only valid for n a
power of 2.
  We also analyze the following model, called the L-reversal chain, introduced
by Durrett. There are n cards arrayed in a circle. Each step, an interval of
cards of length at most L is chosen uniformly at random and its order is
reversed. Durrett has conjectured that the mixing time is O(max(n, n^3/L^3) log

these fermion pairs varies by orders of magnitude from the femtometer scale in
neutron stars and nuclei to the micrometer range in conventional
superconductors. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size
relative to the interparticle spacing. This is expressed in BCS-BEC crossover
theories, describing the crossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type
superfluid of loosely bound and large Cooper pairs to Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) of tightly bound molecules. Such a crossover superfluid has
been realized in ultracold atomic gases where high temperature superfluidity
has been observed. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be
probed with radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy. Previous work was difficult to
interpret due to strong and not well understood final state interactions. Here
we realize a new superfluid spin mixture where such interactions have
negligible influence and present fermion-pair dissociation spectra that reveal
the underlying pairing correlations. This allows us to determine the
spectroscopic pair size in the resonantly interacting gas to be 2.6(2)/kF (kF
is the Fermi wave number). The pairs are therefore smaller than the
interparticle spacing and the smallest pairs observed in fermionic superfluids.
This finding highlights the importance of small fermion pairs for superfluidity
at high critical temperatures. We have also identified transitions from fermion
pairs into bound molecular states and into many-body bound states in the case
of strong final state interactions.

their usefulness for capacity theorems through the derivation of the optimal

multicasting over finite field and Gaussian multiple-access networks as
canonical examples to demonstrate that even if we want to send bits over a

network coding, we also consider distributed computation over noisy channels

through photorefractive media is developed. Diffraction occurs on a reflecting
wire embedded in the nonlinear medium at relatively small angle with respect to
the direction of the beam propagation. It is shown that this process is
analogous to the generation of waves by a flow of a superfluid past an
obstacle. The ``equation of state'' of such a superfluid is determined by the
nonlinear properties of the medium. On the basis of this hydrodynamic analogy,
the notion of the ``Mach number'' is introduced where the transverse component
of the wave vector plays the role of the fluid velocity. It is found that the
Mach cone separates two regions of the diffraction pattern: inside the Mach
cone oblique dark solitons are generated and outside the Mach cone the region
of ``ship waves'' is situated. Analytical theory of ``ship waves'' is developed
and two-dimensional dark soliton solutions of the equation describing the beam
propagation are found. Stability of dark solitons with respect to their decay
into vortices is studied and it is shown that they are stable for large enough

to surmount an energy barrier driven by thermodynamic bias or at ultra-low
temperatures by quantum tunneling. In the present article we demonstrate using
atomistic simulations that at ultra-low temperature transient inter-layer
atomic transport is also possible without tunneling when the Pt/Al(111)
impurity/host system self-organizes itself spontaneously into an intermixed
configuration. No such extremely fast athermal concerted process has been
reported before at ultra low temperatures. The outlined novel transient atomic
exchange mechanism could be of general validity. We find that the source of
ultra-low temperature heavy particle barrier crossing is intrinsic and no
external bias is necessary for atomic intermixing and surface alloying in Pt/Al
although the dynamic barrier height is few eV. The mechanism is driven by the
local thermalization of the Al(111) surface in a self-organized manner arranged
spontaneously by the system without any external stimulus. The core of the
short lived thermalized region reaches the local temperature of $\sim 1000$ K
(including few tens of Al atoms) while the average temperature of the
simulation cell is $\sim 3$ K. The transient facilitated intermixing process
also takes place with repulsive impurity-host interaction potential leading to
negative atomic mobility hence the atomic injection is largely independent of
the strength of the impurity-surface interaction. We predict that similar
exotic behaviour is possible in other materials as well.

effect, in which a transverse spin current can be generated in semiconductors
in the presence of spin-orbit coupling by a frequency-dependent longitudinal
temperature gradient. Because of the thermoelectric effect, there is no net
charge current but there is a heat flow from the hot side to the cold side. We
perform the theoretical calculation of dynamical thermospin Hall conductivity
in a two-dimensional Rashba spintronic system. It has been shown that the
direct interband optical transition dominates the ordering and manipulation of
spin in the generation of a transverse intrinsic spin current. In view of the
role of the thermoelectric effect, the contributions to the thermospin Hall
effect are classified as that originating from a direct contribution of thermal
electronic diffusion and that from the compensatory electron flow in balance
with the thermal diffusion. For a finite system, the analysis yields evidence
that the spin accumulation around the edges of a plate determines the
magnetization. In equilibrium, a field created by a magnetization gradient
emerges in the direction perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The
experimental observation of the thermospin Hall effect is proposed by measuring
the longitudinal temperature difference with the injection of a transverse spin
current and by analyzing the Hall angle. In addition, in order to achieve pure
spin accumulation in the spin Hall effect, an extension of the thermospin Hall
effect for exciting electron-hole pairs in semiconductors is proposed.

completely real {\it i.e.} a complex action. This occurs when the Minkowski
action contains $t$-odd CP-violating terms. Analytic continuation to Euclidean
time yields an imaginary term in the Euclidean action. In the presence of
imaginary terms in the Euclidean action, the usual method of perturbative
quantization can fail. Here the action is expanded about its critical points,
the quadratic part serving to define the Gaussian free theory and the higher
order terms defining the perturbative interactions. For a complex action, the
critical points are generically obtained at complex field configurations. Hence
the contour of path integration does not pass through the critical points and
the perturbative paradigm cannot be directly implemented. The contour of path
integration has to be deformed to pass through the complex critical point using
a generalized method of steepest descent, in order to do so. Typically, what is
done is that only the real part of the Euclidean action is considered, and its
critical points are used to define the perturbation theory. In this article we
present a simple 0+1-dimensional example, of $N$ scalar fields interacting with
a U(1) gauge field, in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, where
alternatively, the path integral can be done exactly, the procedure of
deformation of the contour of path integration can be done explicitly and the

Comparative ab initio studies on graphene based systems allow us to reproduce
the different dispersions. This suggests that individualized nanotubes provide
viable experimental access to collective electronic excitations of graphene,
and it validates the use of graphene to understand electronic excitations of
carbon nanotubes. In particular, the calculations reveal that local field
effects (LFE) cause a mixing of electronic transitions, including the 'Dirac

It turns out that this approach provides a well defined selection rule to give
different Hamitonians for each configurations. The lambda and vee type
configurations are exactly solved with different initial conditions while
taking the two-mode classical and quantized fields . For the classical field,
it is shown that the Rabi oscillation of the lambda model is similar to that of
the vee model and the dynamics of the vee model can be recovered from lambda
model and vice versa simply by inversion. We then proceed to solve the
quantized version of both models introducing a novel Euler matrix formalism. It
is shown that this dynamical symmetry exhibited in the Rabi oscillation of two
configurations for the semiclassical models is completely destroyed on
quantization of the field modes. The symmetry can be restored within the
quantized models when the field modes are both in the coherent states with
large average photon number which is depicted through the collapse and revival
of the Rabi oscillations.

  2008",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077306",,"astro-ph",,"  CONTEXT: Gravitationally lensed quasars constitute an independent tool to
derive H0 through time-delays; they offer as well the opportunity to study the
mass distribution and interstellar medium of their lensing galaxies and,
through microlensing they also allow one to study details of the emitting
source. AIMS: For such studies, one needs to have an excellent knowledge of the
close environment of the lensed images in order to model the lensing potential:
this means observational data over a large field-of-view and spectroscopy at
high spatial resolution. METHODS: We present VIMOS integral field observations
around four lensed quasars: HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4+0551, H 1413+117 and B
1359+154. Using the low, medium and high resolution modes, we study the quasar
images and the quasar environments, as well as provide a detailed report of the
data reduction. RESULTS: Comparison between the quasar spectra of the different
images reveals differences for HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4+0551 and H 1413+117:
flux ratios between the images of the same quasar are different when measured
in the emission lines and in the continuum. We have also measured the redshifts
of galaxies in the neighborhood of HE 0230-2130 and RX J0911.4+0551 which
possibly contribute to the total lensing potential. CONCLUSIONS: A careful
analysis reveals that microlensing is the most natural explanation for the
(de)magnification of the continuum emitting region of the background sources.
In HE 0230-2130, image D is likely to be affected by microlensing
magnification; in RX J0911.4+0551, images A1 and A3 are likely to be modified
by microlensing de-magnification and in H 1413+117, at least image D is
affected by microlensing.

  - 14 pages, 10 figures",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accreting binaries containing a black hole are stellar systems composed of a
normal star and a black hole. Because of the strong gravitational pull of the
black hole, matter is removed from the companion star and falls into the
compact ob ject. In falling, it forms an accretion disk of gas that spirals
towards the center, heating up and emitting in X rays. The physics of such a
structure is extremely complex and can be studied through observations with
X-ray satellites. The time series derived from X-ray observations of bright
black-hole binaries in the Galaxy show a complex phenomenology. Broad noise
components with a variability of up to 40% are observed, as well as
quasi-periodic features on time scales from 100 seconds down to a few
milliseconds. The characteristic frequencies of the different components can
change on very short time scales. However, some of these signals are elusive as
they are very weak and are drowned in intrinsic and instrumental noise. The
physical nature of these signals is still largely unknown, but it is clear that
they originate from gas orbiting a few kilometers from the central black hole
and accreting onto it. In addition of being important for the study of the
accretion of matter onto a black hole, these observational properties
constitute a unique probe for testing General Relativity in the strong field
regime. I review the current observational status as well as the techniques
used to study these signals.

the diffusion length or the grain size. The preference to form patterns at
these angles is a direct consequence of universal scattering properties at
defects. The observed amplitude of the current direction fluctuations scales
inversely to that expected from the relative thickness variations, the grain
size and the defect concentration, all determined independently by standard
methods. This indicates that ultracold atom magnetometry enables new insight
into the interplay between disorder and transport.

some extent, in the dark matter distribution. If these distributions have
fractal geometry, it must be reflected in the geometry of voids; in particular,
we expect scaling sizes of voids. However, this scaling is not well
demonstrated in galaxy surveys yet. AIMS: Our objective is to understand the
geometry of cosmic voids in relation to a fractal structure of matter. We
intend to distinguish monofractal voids from multifractal voids, regarding
their scaling properties. We plan to analyse voids in the distributions of mass
concentrations (halos) in a multifractal and their relation to galaxy voids.
METHODS: We make a statistical analysis of point distributions based on the
void probability function and correlation functions. We assume that voids are
spherical and devise a simple spherical void finder. For continuous mass
distributions, we employ the methods of fractal geometry. We confirm the
analytical predictions with numerical simulations. Smoothed mass distributions
are suitable for the method of excursion sets. RESULTS: Voids are very
nonlinear and non-perturbative structures. Voids reflect the fractal geometry
of the matter distribution but not always directly: scaling sizes of voids
imply fractal geometry, but fractal voids may have a complicated geometry and
may not have scaling sizes. Proper multifractal voids are of this type. A
natural multifractal biasing model implies that the voids in the galaxy
distribution inherit the same complicated geometry. CONCLUSIONS: Current galaxy
surveys as well as cosmological N-body simulations indicate that cosmic voids
are proper multifractal voids. This implies the presence in the voids of
galaxies or, at least, small dark matter halos.

below the scale of eternal inflation is permitted, provided that the background

would of course be the present horizon; other choices manifest themselves in
the running of the correlators. We also demonstrate that it is possible to
define observables that are renormalization group invariant. As an example, we
derive a non-perturbative, infrared finite and renormalization point

processing in Cosmology is the separation of foreground contamination from
cosmic microwave background (CMB). This problem becomes even more difficult in
situations, as the CMB polarization observations, where the amount of available
""a priori"" information is limited. In this case, it is necessary to resort to
the ""blind separation"" methods. One important member of this class is
represented by the ""Independent Components Analysis"" (ICA). In its original
formulation, this method has various interesting characteristics, but also some
limits. One of the most serious is the difficulty to take into account any
information available in advance. In particular, ICA is not able to exploit the
fact that emission of CMB is the same at all the frequencies of observations.
Here, we show how to deal with this question. The connection of the proposed
methodology with the ""Internal Linear Composition"" (ILC) technique is also
illustrated.
  METHODS: A modification of the classic ICA approach is presented and its
characteristics are analyzed both analytically and by means of numerical
experiments.
  RESULTS: The modified version of ICA appears to provide more stable results

incompatible traffic flows at intersections. Inspired by the observation of
self-organized oscillations of pedestrian flows at bottlenecks [D. Helbing and
P. Moln\'ar, Phys. Eev. E 51 (1995) 4282--4286], we propose a self-organization
approach to traffic light control. The problem can be treated as multi-agent
problem with interactions between vehicles and traffic lights. Specifically,
our approach assumes a priority-based control of traffic lights by the vehicle
flows themselves, taking into account short-sighted anticipation of vehicle
flows and platoons. The considered local interactions lead to emergent
coordination patterns such as ``green waves'' and achieve an efficient,
decentralized traffic light control. While the proposed self-control adapts
flexibly to local flow conditions and often leads to non-cyclical switching
patterns with changing service sequences of different traffic flows, an almost
periodic service may evolve under certain conditions and suggests the existence
of a spontaneous synchronization of traffic lights despite the varying delays
due to variable vehicle queues and travel times. The self-organized traffic
light control is based on an optimization and a stabilization rule, each of
which performs poorly at high utilizations of the road network, while their
proper combination reaches a superior performance. The result is a considerable
reduction not only in the average travel times, but also of their variation.
Similar control approaches could be applied to the coordination of logistic and
production processes.

present a study of the Crab Nebula spectral energy distribution (SED) over more
than 6 decades in frequency ranging from 1 to $\rm 10^6 GHz$. The Planck
satellite mission observes the sky from 30 to 857 GHz and therefore we focus on
the millimetre region. We use radio and submillimetre data from the WMAP
satellite between 23 and 94 GHz (from 13 to 3.18 mm) and from the Archeops
balloon experiment between 143 (2.1 mm) and 545 GHz (0.55 mm), and a compendium
of other Crab Nebula observations. The Crab SED is compared to models including
three main components : synchrotron which is responsible for the emission at
low and at high frequencies, dust which explains the excess of flux observed by
the IRAS satellite and an extra component on the millimetre regime. From this
analysis we conclude that the unpolarised emission of the Crab Nebula at
microwave and millimetre wavelengths is the same synchrotron emission that the
one observed in the radio domain. Therefore, we expect the millimetre emission
of the Crab nebula to be polarised with the same degree of polarisation and
orientation than the radio emission. We set upper limits on the possible errors
induced by any millimetre extra component on the reconstruction of the degree
and angle of polarisation at the percent level as a maximum. This result
strongly supports the choice by the Planck collaboration of the Crab nebula
emission for performing polarisation cross-checks in the range 30 (299 mm) to
353 GHz (0.849 mm).

black hole (BH) invoking the BZ process. The second stage is a quiet stage, in
which the BZ process is shut off, and the accretion onto the BH is depressed by
the torque exerted by the magnetic coupling (MC) process. Part of the
rotational energy transported by the MC process from the BH is stored in the
disk as magnetic energy. In the third stage, the MC process is shut off when
the magnetic energy in the disk accumulates and triggers the magnetic
instability. At this moment, the hyperaccretion process may onset, and the jet
launched in this restarted central engine generates the observed X-ray flares.
This model can account for energies and timescales of GRBs with X-ray flares
observed in early afterglows.

networks involving non-linear integration-and-fire dynamics exhibit an abrupt
activation along their transient regime. Interestingly, such an avalanche of
activation has also been found to depend strongly on the topology of the
networks: while the Erd\H{o}s-R\'eny, Barab\'asi-Albert, path-regular and
path-transformed BA models exhibit well-defined avalanches; Watts-Strogatz and
geographical structures present instead a gradual dispersion of activation
amongst their nodes. The current work investigates such phenomena by
considering a mean-field equivalent model of a network which is strongly
founded on the concepts of concentric neighborhoods and degrees. It is shown
that the hierarchical number of nodes and hierarchical degrees define the
intensity and timing of the avalanches. This approach also allowed the
identification of the beginning activation times during the transient dynamics,
which is particularly important for community identification (arXiv:0801.4269,
arXiv:0801.4684). The main concepts and results in this work are illustrated
with respect to theoretical and real-world (\emph{C. elegans}) networks.
Several results are reported, including the identification of secondary
avalanches, the validation of the equivalent model, the identification of the
possible universality of the avalanches for most networks (depending only on
the network size), as well as the identification of the fact that different
avalanches can be obtained by locating the activation source at different

constitutive law comes from the dynamic impedances of the foundation. The
non-linear part comprises two mechanisms. One is due to the irreversible
elastoplastic soil behavior: it is described with a bounding surface
hypoplastic model, adapted for the description of the cyclic soil response. An
original feature of the formulation is that the bounding surface is considered
independently of the surface of ultimate loads of the system. The second
mechanism is the detachment that can take place at the soil-footing interface
(foundation uplift). It is totally reversible and non-dissipative and can thus
be described by a phenomenological non-linear elastic model. The macroelement
is qualitatively validated by application to soil-structure interaction
analyses of simple real structures.

burrowing leading to intact cluster inclusions. In particular, the anomalously
fast (ballistic) Pt nanocluster implantation into Al and Ti substrates has been
found by molecular dynamics simulations using a tight-binding many-body
potential with the 1-5 eV/atom low impact energy. Similar behavior has also
been found for many other cluster/substrate couples such as Cu/Al and Ni/Ti,
Co/Ti, etc. In particular, in Ni/Ti at already $\sim 0.5$ eV/atom impact energy
burrowing takes place. At this few eV/atom low impact energy regime instead of
the expected stopping at the surface we find the propagation of the cluster
through a thin Al slab as thick as $\sim 50$ $\hbox{\AA}$ with a nearly
constant speed ($\propto 1$ eV/atom). Hence the cluster moves far beyond the
range of the impact energy which suggests that the mechanism of cluster
burrowing can not be explained simply by collisional cascade effects. In the
couples with reversed succession (e.g. Ti/Pt, Al/Pt) no burrowing has been
found, the clusters remain on the surface (the asymmetry of burrowing). We
argue that cluster penetration occurs at few eV/atom impact energy when the
cluster/substrate interaction is size-mismatched and mass anisotropic

absolute value of the angular momentum L, a form suitable for comparison with

model of the DF in the form
f_{E}(E)[1+L^{2}/(2L_{0}^{2})]^{-\beta_{\infty}+\beta_{0}}L^{-2\beta_{0}}. This
formulation involves three parameters describing the anisotropy profile in
terms of its asymptotic values (\beta_{0} and \beta_{\infty}) and the scale of
transition between them (L_{0}). The energy part f_{E}(E) is obtained via
inversion of the integral for spatial density. We provide a straightforward
numerical scheme for this procedure as well as a simple analytical
approximation for a typical halo formed in the simulation. The DF model is
extensively compared with the simulations: using the model parameters obtained
from fitting the anisotropy profile, we recover the DF from the simulation as

planets near the solar temperature. We also find that the vsini and $R^{'}_{\rm
HK}$ anomalies correlate with the Li abundance anomalies. These results suggest
that planet formation processes have altered the rotation and Li abundances of
stars that host Doppler detected planets. We encourage others to test these
findings with additional observations of Li in stars with temperatures between
5600 and 6200 K.

  Structure: Inferences on Several Flood Characteristics",,,"10.1029/2007WR006322",,"stat.AP",,"  Flood quantile estimation is of great importance for many engineering studies
and policy decisions. However, practitioners must often deal with small data
available. Thus, the information must be used optimally. In the last decades,
to reduce the waste of data, inferential methodology has evolved from annual
maxima modeling to peaks over a threshold one. To mitigate the lack of data,
peaks over a threshold are sometimes combined with additional information -
mostly regional and historical information. However, whatever the extra
information is, the most precious information for the practitioner is found at
the target site. In this study, a model that allows inferences on the whole
time series is introduced. In particular, the proposed model takes into account
the dependence between successive extreme observations using an appropriate
extremal dependence structure. Results show that this model leads to more
accurate flood peak quantile estimates than conventional estimators. In
addition, as the time dependence is taken into account, inferences on other
flood characteristics can be performed. An illustration is given on flood
duration. Our analysis shows that the accuracy of the proposed models to
estimate the flood duration is related to specific catchment characteristics.
Some suggestions to increase the flood duration predictions are introduced.

that the differential operators $X=Q(x)$, $Y=Q(\partial)$, and
$H=E+\frac{n}{2}$, where $E$ is the Euler operator, generate a Lie algebra
isomorphic to ${\go sl}_{2}$. Therefore the associative algebra they generate
is a quotient of the universal enveloping algebra ${\cal U}({\go sl}_{2})$.
This fact is in some sense the foundation of the metaplectic representation.
The present paper is devoted to the study of the case where $Q(x)$ is replaced
by $\Delta_{0}(x)$, where $\Delta_{0}(x)$ is the relative invariant of a
prehomogeneous vector space of commutative parabolic type ($ {\go g},V $), or
equivalently where $\Delta_{0}$ is the ""determinant"" function of a simple
Jordan algebra $V$ over ${\bb C}$. In this Part I we show several structure
results for the associative algebra generated by $X=\Delta_{0}(x)$,
$Y=\Delta_{0}(\partial)$. Our main result shows that if we consider this
algebra as an algebra over a certain commutative ring ${\bf A}$ of invariant
differential operators it is isomorphic to the quotient of what we call a
generalized Smith algebra $S(f, {\bf A}, n)$ where $f\in {\bf A}[t]$. The Smith
algebras (over ${\bb C}$) were introduced by P. Smith as ""natural""
generalizations of ${\cal U}({\go sl}_{2})$.

of these features. In this paper we compare three different methods already
extant in the literature for assessing the significance of possible line
features and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages. The methods
are demonstrated by application to observations of 40 bursts from the archive
of Swift XRT at early times (< few ks post trigger in the rest frame of the
burst). Based on this thorough analysis we found no strong evidence for
emission lines. For each of the three methods we have determined detection
limits for emission line strengths in bursts with spectral parameters typical
of the Swift-era sample. We also discuss the effects of the current calibration
status on emission line detection.

true slip length due to hydrophobicity. This length, of the order of several
tens of nanometers, is independent on electrolyte concentration and shear rate.

challenged by several features of the data: (1) the effects of possible
covariates (for example, the alcohol outlet density of each census tract) on
the assaultive crime rates may be complex; (2) the covariates may be highly
correlated with each other; (3) there are a lot of missing inputs in the data;
and (4) spatial correlations exist in the outcome assaultive crime rates. We
propose a hierarchical additive model, where the nonlinear correlations and the
complex interaction effects are modeled using the multiple additive regression
trees (MART) and the spatial variances in the assaultive rates that cannot be
explained by the specified covariates are smoothed trough the Conditional
Autoregressive (CAR) model. We develop a two-stage algorithm that connect the
non-parametric trees with CAR to look for important variables covariates
associated with the assaultive crime rates, while taking account of the spatial
correlations among adjacent census tracts. The proposed methods are applied to
the Los Angeles assaultive data (1990-1999) and compared with traditional
