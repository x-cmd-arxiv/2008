of the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. These rates become
self-consistent within EPS once we realize that the typical merger in the limit
of a small time-step involves more than two progenitors, contrary to the
assumption of binary mergers adopted in earlier studies. We present a general
method for computing merger rates that span the range of solutions permitted by
the EPS conditional mass function, and focus on a specific solution that
attempts to match the merger rates in N-body simulations. The corrected EPS
merger rates are more accurate than the earlier estimates of Lacey & Cole, by
~20% for major mergers and by up to a factor of ~3 for minor mergers of mass
ratio 1:10^4. Based on the revised merger rates, we provide a new algorithm for
constructing Monte-Carlo EPS merger trees, that could be useful in
Semi-Analytic Modeling. We provide analytic expressions and plot numerical
results for several quantities that are very useful in studies of galaxy
formation. This includes (a) the rate of mergers of a given mass ratio per
given final halo, (b) the fraction of mass added by mergers to a halo, and (c)
the rate of mergers per given main progenitor. The creation and destruction
rates of haloes serve for a self-consistency check. Our method for computing
merger rates can be applied to conditional mass functions beyond EPS, such as
those obtained by the ellipsoidal collapse model or extracted from $N$-body
simulations.

BH accretion rate decrease and the growth timescales of the central black holes

accretion rate typically occurs shortly after the time of BH merging for low
progenitor mass ratios (e.g. 3:1 and lower), whereas for higher progenitor mass
ratios there is no clear correlation between the peak BH accretion rate and BH

in density, temperature and magnetic field. The presence of these gradients may
lead to the appearance of currents in the plasma, which in the weakly
collisional corona can constitute sources of free energy for driving
micro-instabilities. Such instabilities are very important since they represent
a possible source of ion-cyclotron waves which have been conjectured to play a
prominent role in coronal heating, but whose solar origin remains unclear.
Considering a density stratification transverse to the magnetic field, this
paper aims at studying the possible occurrence of gradient-induced plasma
micro-instabilities under typical conditions of coronal holes. Taking into
account the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, we perform a Fourier
plane waves analysis using the collisionless multi-fluid model. By neglecting
the electron inertia, this model allows us to take into account ion-cyclotron
wave effects that are absent from the one-fluid model of magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD). Realistic models of density and temperature, as well as a 2-D analytical
magnetic-field model, are used to define the background plasma in the
open-field funnel in a polar coronal hole. The ray-tracing theory is used to
compute the ray path of the unstable waves, as well as the evolution of their
growth rates during the propagation. We demonstrate that in typical coronal
hole conditions, and when assuming typical transverse density length scales
taken from radio observations, the current generated by a relative electron-ion
drift provides enough free energy for driving the mode unstable. This
instability results from a coupling between oppositely propagating slow-mode
waves.

success of the future gravitational wave observatories. Although integrable in
principle, test particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate,
and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general
properties has been a challenge. This is the first in a series of papers that
adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with
equatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a
correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy
defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is
in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit
taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits
is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out
precessions of multi-leaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore,
for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which
zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable. Finally, we sketch the potential
application of the taxonomy to problems of astrophysical interest, in
particular its utility for computationally intensive gravitational wave
calculations.

spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), satellites of the Milky Way (MW). An improved
version of the semi-analytical code GAMETE (GAlaxy Merger Tree & Evolution) is
used to follow the dSphs evolution simultaneously with the MW formation,
matching the observed properties of both. In this scenario dSph galaxies
represent fossil objects virializing at z = 7.2 +/- 0.7 (i.e. in the
pre-reionization era z > z_rei = 6) in the MW environment, which at that epoch
has already been pre-enriched up to [Fe/H] ~ -3; their dynamical masses are in
the narrow range M = (1.6 +/- 0.7) x 10^8 M_sun, although a larger spread might
be introduced by a more refined treatment of reionization. Mechanical feedback
effects are dramatic in such low-mass objects, causing the complete blow-away
of the gas ~100 Myr after the formation epoch: 99% of the present-day stellar
mass, M_* = (3 +/- 0.7) x 10^6 M_sun, forms during this evolutionary phase,
i.e. their age is >13 Gyr. Later on, star formation is re-ignited by returned
gas from evolved stars and a second blow-away occurs. The cycle continues for
about 1 Gyr during which star formation is intermittent. At z = 0 the dSph gas
content is M_g = (2.68 +/- 0.97) x 10^4 M_sun. Our results match several
observed properties of Sculptor, used as a template of dSphs: (i) the

homogeneous. However the consensus on a homogeneous matter structure, even on

dimension calculations is that they enable one to obtain the transition scale
to a homogeneous distribution, whereas other methods, such as those using the
two-point correlation function, make it hard to exhibit the possible fractal
properties of the Universe matter content. Our purpose is to calculate the
correlation dimension $D_2$, looking for a possible transition to homogeneity,
which would imply $D_2 = 3$. We apply the correlation integral method to the
three dimensional sample composed of 332,876 galaxies which we extract from the
Fifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze the raw data up
to the scale $d_{max} = 160$ Mpc, assuming $H_0 = 70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
and considering three cosmological models in order to test the model dependence
of our method. Using volume limited samples for this range leaves us with about
20,000 galaxies. Applying our method to random maps helps us to calibrate our
results. We obtain a correlation dimension of the galaxy distribution which
seems to increase with scales up to $D_2=3$ reached around 70 Mpc. The results
of our analysis, performed on the largest volume limited sample which can be
extracted from the SDSS catalog, are compatible with those formerly obtained by
other authors. However, to get a more reliable description of the structures at
various scales, we think it will be mandatory to use still larger catalogs than
those which are currently available.

contain an anomalous U(1), which gives rise to a Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term that
breaks supersymmetry at the one--loop level in string perturbation theory.
Supersymmetry is traditionally restored by imposing F- and D-flatness on the
vacuum. By employing the standard analysis of flat directions we present a
quasi--realistic three generation string model in which stringent F- and D-flat
solution do not appear to exist to all orders in the superpotential. We
speculate that this result is indicative of the non-existence of supersymmetric
flat F- and D-solutions in this model. We provide some arguments in support of
this scenario and discuss its potential implications. Bose-Fermi degeneracy of
the string spectrum implies that the one--loop partition function and hence the
one-loop cosmological constant vanishes in the model. If our assertion is
correct, this model may represent the first known example with vanishing
cosmological constant and perturbatively broken supersymmetry. We discuss the
distinctive properties of the internal free fermion boundary conditions that
may correspond to a large set of models that share these properties. The
geometrical moduli in this class of models are fixed due to asymmetric boundary
conditions, whereas absence of supersymmetric flat directions would imply that
the supersymmetric moduli are fixed as well and the dilaton may be fixed by
hidden sector nonperturbative effects.

required properties. Apart from 980425, which appears to be a definite outlier
and notoriously peculiar in many respects, we used 40 GRBs to fit the
correlation with the maximum likelihood method discussed by D'Agostini,
suitable to account for the extrinsic scatter in addition to the intrinsic
uncertainties affecting every single GRB. We confirm the correlation. However,
unlike the results by Firmani et al., we found that the correlation does have a
logarithmic scatter comparable with that of the E_p,i-E_iso (""Amati"")
correlation. We also find that the slope of the product L_p,iso T_0.45 is equal
to ~0.5, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the E_p,i-L_p,iso-T_0.45
correlation is equivalent to the E_p,i-E_iso correlation (slope ~0.5). We
conclude that, based on presently available data, there is no clear evidence
that the E_p,i-L_p,iso-T_0.45 correlation is different (both in terms of slope
and dispersion) from the E_p,i-E_iso correlation.

1/\omega singularity is determined by high orders of perturbation theory, (ii)
the high-order behaviors for two quantities \Phi^{RA} and U^{RA} are the same,
and (iii) \Phi^{RA} has the 1/\omega singularity, whereas U^{RA} does not have
it. Solution to the paradox indicates that the instanton method makes it
possible to obtain only the 1/(\omega + i\gamma) singularity, where the
parameter \gamma remains indefinite and must be determined from additional
conditions. This conceptually confirms the necessity of the self-consistent
treatment for the diffusion coefficient that is used in the Vollhardt-Wolfle
type theories.

incompletely understood features of higher spin field theory. We are mainly
considering higher spin gauge fields in their own right as free-standing
theoretical constructs and not circumstances where they occur as part of
another system. Considering the problem of introducing interactions among
higher spin gauge fields, there has historically been two broad avenues of
approach. One approach entails gauging a non-Abelian global symmetry algebra,
in the process making it local. The other approach entails deforming an already
local but Abelian gauge algebra, in the process making it non-Abelian. In cases
where both avenues have been explored, such as for spin 1 and 2 gauge fields,
the results agree (barring conceptual and technical issues) with Yang-Mills
theory and Einstein gravity. In the case of an infinite tower of higher spin
gauge fields, the first approach has been thoroughly developed and explored by
M. Vasiliev, whereas the second approach, after having lain dormant for a long
time, has received new attention by several authors lately. In the present
paper we briefly review some aspects of the history of higher spin gauge fields
as a backdrop to an attempt at comparing the gauging vs. deforming approaches.
A common unifying structure of strongly homotopy Lie algebras underlying both
approaches will be discussed. The modern deformation approach, using BRST-BV
methods, will be described as far as it is developed at the present time. The
first steps of a formulation in the categorical language of operads will be
outlined. A few aspects of the subject that seems not to have been thoroughly
investigated are pointed out.

characterize the evolution of the order parameter through the ordering
transition. The distribution is found to be bimodal and bounded within a window
$\sim 0.1 \le \beta \le 0.25$, facts that are only in partial agreement with
the established theory of critical phenomena. In particular, the bounded nature
of the distribution is impossible to reconcile with existing theory for one of
the major universality classes of two dimensional behaviour - the XY model with
four fold crystal field - which predicts a spectrum of non-universal exponents
bounded only from below. Through a combination of numerical and renormalization
group arguments we resolve the contradiction between theory and experiment and
demonstrate how the ""universal window"" for critical exponents observed in

most of the time restricted to cluster cores, point towards field strength of
the order of a few microG (synchrotron radiation from radio relics and radio
halos, inverse Compton radiation in X-rays and Faraday rotation measure of
polarised background sources). Both the origin and the spatial structure of
galaxy clusters magnetic fields are still under debate. In particular, the
radial profile of the magnetic field, from the core of clusters to their
outskirts, is of great importance for cosmic rays propagation within the Cosmic
Web. In this letter, we highlight the importance of cooling processes in
amplifying the magnetic field in the core of galaxy clusters up to one order of
magnitude above the typical amplification obtained for a pure adiabatic
evolution. We have performed a ""zoom'' cosmological simulation of a 3 keV
cluster, including dark matter and gas dynamics, atomic cooling, UV heating and
star formation using the newly developed MHD solver in the AMR code RAMSES.
Magnetic field amplification proceeds mainly through gravitational contraction.
Shearing motions due to turbulence provide additional amplification in the
outskirts of the cluster, while magnetic reconnection during mergers causes
magnetic field dissipation in the core. Cooling processes have a strong impact
on the magnetic field structure in the cluster. First, due to the sharp rise of
the gas density in the centre, gravitational amplification is significantly
amplified, when compared to the non--radiative run. Second, due to cooling
processes, shearing motions are much stronger in the core than in the adiabatic
case, leading to additional field amplification and no significant magnetic
reconnection.

can show up as observational signatures in the power spectrum and/or
non-Gaussianities of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). One
general example of such sharp features is a succession of small steps in a
warped throat, caused by Seiberg duality cascade using gauge/gravity duality.
We study the cosmological observational consequences of these steps in brane
inflation. Since the steps come in a series, the prediction of other steps and
their properties can be tested by future data and analysis. It is also possible
that the steps are too close to be resolved in the power spectrum, in which
case they may show up only in the non-Gaussianity of the CMB temperature
fluctuations and/or EE polarization. We study two cases. In the slow-roll
scenario where steps appear in the inflaton potential, the sensitivity of brane
inflation to the height and width of the steps is increased by several orders
of magnitude comparing to that in previously studied large field models. In the
IR DBI scenario where steps appear in the warp factor, we find that the
glitches in the power spectrum caused by these sharp features are generally
small or even unobservable, but associated distinctive non-Gaussianity can be
large. Together with its large negative running of the power spectrum index,
this scenario clearly illustrates how rich and different a brane inflationary
scenario can be when compared to generic slow-roll inflation. Such distinctive
stringy features may provide a powerful probe of superstring theory.

exact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction is
treated in the modelling. However, the sources show a clear increase in stellar
mass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. In terms of SED types, only two
out of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fit
by a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per cent
of the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (Sc, Im and starburst). By
including photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average SCUBA source is
forming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied from
the rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates
15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. Using a simplistic calculation, we
estimate from the average star formation history that between one in five and
one in 15 bright (L_* +2 mag < L_optical < L_* -1 mag) galaxies in the field
over the interval 0 < z < 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience a
similar energetic dusty burst of star formation. Finally, we compute the
evolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

the cluster center. These features are clearly related to the radio galaxy
PKS2354-35 which resides in the cD galaxy. Our new data confirm these previous
findings and strengthen previous suggestions that the south-western ridge is
colder and denser than, but in approximate pressure equilibrium with, the
surrounding ICM atmosphere. In addition, we find evidence for a weak shock that
wraps around the north and east sides of the cavity structure. Our data allow
us to map the 2-dimensional distribution of metals in the ICM of A4059 for the
first time. We find that the SW ridge possesses an anomalously high
(super-solar) metalicity. The unusual morphology, temperature structure and
metal distribution all point to significant asymmetry in the ICM atmosphere
prior to the onset of radio-galaxy activity. Motivated by the very high
metalicity of the SW ridge, we hypothesize that the ICM asymmetry was caused by
the extremely rapid stripping of metal enriched gas from a starburst galaxy
that plunged through the core of A4059. Furthermore, we suggest that the onset
of powerful radio-galaxy activity in the cD galaxy may have been initiated by
this starburst/stripping event, either via the tidal-shocking of cold gas
native to the cD galaxy, or the accretion of cold gas that had been stripped
from the starburst galaxy.

are often hampered by uncertainties in distances and heavy foreground

luminosities greater than a few times 10^32 ergs s^-1, with spectra indicative
of highly absorbed emission from a thin plasma at high temperatures typical of
colliding winds in WR+OB binary systems. Significant X-ray variability with
periods ranging from a few hours up to ~20 days is seen associated with several
WR stars. In most of these cases, the X-ray variability can be linked to the
orbital motion of the WR star in a binary system, further supporting the
colliding wind scenario for the origin of the X-ray emission from these stars.

clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. We have computed eight simulations with N ~

of this modelling is to examine the possibility of large-scale core expansion
in massive star clusters and search for a viable dynamical origin for the
radius-age trend observed for such objects in the Magellanic Clouds. We
identify two physical processes which can lead to significant and prolonged
cluster core expansion: mass-loss due to rapid stellar evolution in a
primordially mass segregated cluster, and heating due to a retained population
of stellar-mass black holes. These two processes operate over different
time-scales - the former occurs only at early times and cannot drive core
expansion for longer than a few hundred Myr, while the latter typically does
not begin until several hundred Myr have passed but can result in core
expansion lasting for many Gyr. We investigate the behaviour of these expansion
mechanisms in clusters with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation and
in clusters with varying black hole retention fractions. In combination, the
two processes can lead to a wide variety of evolutionary paths on the
radius-age plane, which fully cover the observed cluster distribution and hence
define a dynamical origin for the radius-age trend in the Magellanic Clouds. We
discuss the implications of core expansion for various aspects of globular
cluster research, as well as the possibility of observationally inferring the

nonperturbative aspects of QCD such as the orbital and radial spectra of
hadrons and the form of hadronic wavefunctions. In particular, we show that
there is an exact correspondence between the fifth-dimensional coordinate of
AdS space $z$ and a specific impact variable $\zeta$ which measures the
separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron in ordinary
space-time. This connection leads to AdS/CFT predictions for the analytic form
of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) of mesons and
baryons, the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties. The LFWFs in
turn predict decay constants and spin correlations, as well as dynamical

no a priori knowledge of the true orbital parameters of the systems. 1) Planets
with astrometric signatures $\alpha\simeq 3$ times the single-measurement error
$\sigma_\psi$ and period $P\leq 5$ yr can be detected reliably, with a very
small number of false positives. 2) At twice the detection limit, uncertainties
in orbital parameters and masses are typically $15%-20%$. 3) Over 70% of
two-planet systems with well-separated periods in the range $0.2\leq P\leq 9$
yr, $2\leq\alpha/\sigma_\psi\leq 50$, and eccentricity $e\leq 0.6$ are
correctly identified. 4) Favorable orbital configurations have orbital elements
measured to better than 10% accuracy $> 90%$ of the time, and the value of the
mutual inclination angle determined with uncertainties $\leq 10^{\degr}$. 5)
Finally, uncertainties obtained from the fitting procedures are a good estimate
of the actual errors. Extrapolating from the present-day statistical properties
of the exoplanet sample, the results imply that a Gaia with $\sigma_\psi$ = 8
$\mu$as, in its unbiased and complete magnitude-limited census of planetary
systems, will measure several thousand giant planets out to 3-4 AUs from stars
within 200 pc, and will characterize hundreds of multiple-planet systems,
including meaningful coplanarity tests. Finally, we put Gaia into context,
identifying several areas of planetary-system science in which Gaia can be
expected to have a relevant impact, when combined with data coming from other
ongoing and future planet search programs.

folding in vivo often requires the participation of barrel-shaped multimeric
complexes known as chaperonins. Although it has long been known that chaperonin
substrates fold upon sequestration inside the chaperonin barrel, the precise
mechanism by which confinement within this space facilitates folding remains
unknown. In this study, we examine the possibility that the chaperonin mediates
a favorable reorganization of the solvent for the folding reaction. We begin by
discussing the effect of electrostatic charge on solvent-mediated hydrophobic
forces in an aqueous environment. Based on these initial physical arguments, we
construct a simple, phenomenological theory for the thermodynamics of density
and hydrogen bond order fluctuations in liquid water. Within the framework of
this model, we investigate the effect of confinement within a chaperonin-like
cavity on the configurational free energy of water by calculating solvent free
energies for cavities corresponding to the different conformational states in
the ATP- driven catalytic cycle of the prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL. Our
findings suggest that one function of chaperonins may be to trap unfolded
proteins and subsequently expose them to a micro-environment in which the
hydrophobic effect, a crucial thermodynamic driving force for folding, is
enhanced.

kinetic model for low-density granular mixtures recently proposed by the
authors [Vega Reyes F et al. 2007 Phys. Rev. E 75 061306]. Two routes have been
considered. First, a hydrodynamic or normal solution is found by exploiting a
formal mapping between the kinetic equations for the gas particles and for the
impurity. We show that the transport properties of the impurity are
characterized by the ratio between the temperatures of the impurity and gas
particles and by five generalized transport coefficients: three related to the
momentum flux (a nonlinear shear viscosity and two normal stress differences)
and two related to the heat flux (a nonlinear thermal conductivity and a cross
coefficient measuring a component of the heat flux orthogonal to the thermal
gradient). Second, by means of a Monte Carlo simulation method we numerically
solve the kinetic equations and show that our hydrodynamic solution is valid in
the bulk of the fluid when realistic boundary conditions are used. Furthermore,
the hydrodynamic solution applies to arbitrarily (inside the continuum regime)
large values of the shear rate, of the inelasticity, and of the rest of
parameters of the system. Preliminary simulation results of the true Boltzmann
description show the reliability of the nonlinear hydrodynamic solution of the
kinetic model. This shows again the validity of a hydrodynamic description for
granular flows, even under extreme conditions, beyond the Navier-Stokes domain.

composed of an extremal dust fluid, a charged dust fluid where the mass density
is equal to the charge density, joined to an exterior vacuum solution, within
Newtonian gravity and general relativity. In four dimensions, they obey the
corresponding Majumdar-Papapetrou system, where the gravitational potential is
a simple function of the electric potential field and the fluid, when there is
one, is made of extremal dust. The Majumdar-Papapetrou system can be
generalized to d spacetime dimensions. Thus, it is natural to study Bonnor
solutions in higher d dimensions. We analyze Newton-Coulomb theory with an
electrically charged fluid in a Majumdar-Papapetrou context, in d=n+1 spacetime
dimensions, n the number of spatial dimensions. Within the Newtonian theory, in
vacuum, the Majumdar-Papapetrou relation for the gravitational potential in
terms of the electric potential, and its related Weyl relation, are equivalent,
in contrast with general relativity. We study a class of spherically symmetric
Bonnor stars. Under sufficient compactification they form point mass charged
Newtonian singularities. We study the analogue systems in the Einstein-Maxwell
theory with an electrically charged fluid. We restate some properties of this
system and obtain spherically symmetric Bonnor star solutions in d=n+1
spacetime dimensions. These stars, under compactification, form quasi-black
holes. Whereas there are no solutions for Newtonian or relativistic stars
supported by degenerate pressure in higher dimensions, higher dimensional
Bonnor stars, supported by electric repulsion, do indeed have solutions within
Newtonian gravity and general relativity. So the existence of stars depends on
the number of dimensions and on the underlying field content.

high SNR (signal to noise power ratio). In this paper, we seek similar capacity
characterizations for wireless networks with relays, feedback, full duplex
operation, and transmitter/receiver cooperation through noisy channels. First,
we consider a network with $S$ source nodes, $R$ relay nodes and $D$
destination nodes with random time-varying/frequency-selective channel
coefficients and global channel knowledge at all nodes. We allow full-duplex
operation at all nodes, as well as causal noise-free feedback of all received
signals to all source and relay nodes. The sum capacity of this network is
characterized as $\frac{SD}{S+D-1}\log({SNR})+o(\log({SNR}))$. The implication
of the result is that the capacity benefits of relays, causal feedback,
transmitter/receiver cooperation through physical channels and full duplex
operation become a negligible fraction of the network capacity at high SNR.
Some exceptions to this result are also pointed out in the paper. Second, we
consider a network with $K$ full duplex nodes with an independent message from
every node to every other node in the network. We find that the sum capacity of
this network is bounded below by $\frac{K(K-1)}{2K-2}+o(\log({SNR}))$ and
bounded above by $\frac{K(K-1)}{2K-3}+o(\log({SNR}))$.

k-dimensional tree (kd-tree) and support vector machines (SVMs), to separate
quasars from stars in the databases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogs. The two algorithms are trained
on subsets of SDSS and 2MASS objects whose nature is known via spectroscopy. We
choose different attribute combination as input patterns to train the
classifier using photometric data only and present the classification results
obtained by these two methods. Performance metrics such as precision and
recall, true positive rate and true negative rate, F-measure, G-mean and
Weighted Accuracy are computed to evaluate the performance of the two
algorithms. The study shows that both kd-tree and SVMs are effective automated
algorithms to classify point sources. SVMs show slightly higher accuracy, but
kd-tree requires less computation time. Given different input patterns based on
various parameters(e.g. magnitudes, color information), we conclude that both
kd-tree and SVMs show better performance with fewer features. What is more, our
results also indicate that the accuracy using the four colors (u-g, g-r, r-i,
i-z) and r magnitude based on SDSS model magnitudes adds up to the highest
value. The classifiers trained by kd-tree and SVMs can be used to solve the
automated classification problems faced by the virtual observatory (VO);
moreover, they all can be applied for the photometric preselection of quasar
candidates for large survey projects in order to optimize the efficiency of

the properties of both components can be studied together by direct
measurements. In this paper, we focus on the broad-line composite galaxies
(composite AGNs) which are located between the theoretical and empirical
separation lines in the [NII]/Ha vs. [OIII]/Hb diagram. These galaxies are
searched for from the composite galaxies provided by the SDSS DR4 MPA/JHU
catalogs. After re-analyze the spectra, we perform a fine classification for
the 85 composite AGNs in terms of the BPT diagrams. All the objects located
below the three theoretical separation lines are associated with a young
stellar population (<1Gyrs), while either a young or old stellar population is
identified in the individual multiply-classified object. The
multiply-classified objects with a very old stellar population are located in
the LINER region in the [OI]/Ha vs. [OIII]/Hb diagram. We then consider the
connection between AGN and star formation to derive the key results. The
Eddington ratio inferred from the broad Ha emission, the age of the stellar
population of AGN's host as assessed by D_n(4000), and the line ratio [OI]/Ha
are found to be related with each other. These relations strongly support the
evolutionary scenario in which AGNs evolve from high L/L_Edd state with soft
spectrum to low L/L_Edd state with hard spectrum as young stellar population
ages and fades. The significant correlation between the line ratio [OI]/Ha and
D_n(4000) leads us to suggest that the line ratio could be used to trace the

from the non-asymptotic viewpoint, and suggest an improvement on it, which we
call ``V-fold penalization''. Considering a particular (though simple)
regression problem, we prove that VFCV with a bounded V is suboptimal for model
selection, because it ``overpenalizes'' all the more that V is large. Hence,
asymptotic optimality requires V to go to infinity. However, when the
signal-to-noise ratio is low, it appears that overpenalizing is necessary, so
that the optimal V is not always the larger one, despite of the variability
issue. This is confirmed by some simulated data. In order to improve on the
prediction performance of VFCV, we define a new model selection procedure,
called ``V-fold penalization'' (penVF). It is a V-fold subsampling version of
Efron's bootstrap penalties, so that it has the same computational cost as
VFCV, while being more flexible. In a heteroscedastic regression framework,
assuming the models to have a particular structure, we prove that penVF
satisfies a non-asymptotic oracle inequality with a leading constant that tends
to 1 when the sample size goes to infinity. In particular, this implies
adaptivity to the smoothness of the regression function, even with a highly
heteroscedastic noise. Moreover, it is easy to overpenalize with penVF,
independently from the V parameter. A simulation study shows that this results
in a significant improvement on VFCV in non-asymptotic situations.

experiments and astrophysical systems, and they are investigated either to
prevent unstable modes arising in beam-plasma experiments or to prove the
existence of large scale magnetic fields in astrophysical objects.
Filamentation instability arises in a counterstreaming plasma and is
responsible for the magnetization of the plasma. Filamentationally unstable
mode is described by assuming that each of the counterstreaming plasmas has an
isotropic Lorentzian (kappa) distribution. In this case, the filamentation
instability growth rate can reach a maximum value markedly larger than that for
a a plasma with a Maxwellian distribution function. This behaviour is opposite
to what was observed for the Weibel instability growth rate in a bi-kappa
plasma, which is always smaller than that obtained for a bi-Maxwellian plasma.
The approach is further generalized for a counterstreaming plasma with a
bi-kappa temperature anisotropy. In this case, the filamentation instability
growth rate is enhanced by the Weibel effect when the plasma is hotter in the
streaming direction, and the growth rate becomes even larger. These effects
improve significantly the efficiency of the magnetic field generation, and
provide further support for the potential role of the Weibel-type instabilities
in the fast magnetization scenarios.

aiding the development of a new quantum gravity theory; to measure key solar
system parameters with increased accuracy, advancing solar physics and our
knowledge of the solar system and to measure the time rate of change of the
gravitational constant with an order of magnitude improvement and the anomalous
Pioneer acceleration, thereby probing dark matter and dark energy
gravitationally. It is an international project, with major contributions from
Europe and China and is envisaged as the first in a series of ASTROD missions.
ASTROD I will consist of one spacecraft carrying a telescope, four lasers, two
event timers and a clock. Two-way, two-wavelength laser pulse ranging will be
used between the spacecraft in a solar orbit and deep space laser stations on
Earth, to achieve the ASTROD I goals. A second mission, ASTROD II is envisaged
as a three-spacecraft mission which would test General Relativity to one part
per billion, enable detection of solar g-modes, measure the solar
Lense-Thirring effect to 10 parts per million, and probe gravitational waves at
frequencies below the LISA bandwidth. In the third phase (ASTROD III or
Super-ASTROD), larger orbits could be implemented to map the outer solar system
and to probe primordial gravitational-waves at frequencies below the ASTROD II
bandwidth.

BJ007) claims that no sign of evaporation is observed. Here we show that, in
fact, this new analysis is consistent with the one of Vidal-Madjar et al.
(2003, VM003) and supports the detection of evaporation. The apparent
disagreement is mainly due to the disparate wavelength ranges that are used to
derive the transit absorption depth. VM003 derives a (15+/-4)% absorption depth
during transit over the core of the stellar Lyman-alpha line (from -130 km/s to
+100 km/s), and this result agrees with the (8.9+/-2.1)% absorption depth
reported by BJ007 from a slightly expanded dataset but over a larger wavelength
range (+/-200 km/s). These measurements agree also with the (5+/-2)% absorption
reported by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004) over the whole Lyman-alpha line from
independent, lower-resolution data. We show that stellar Lyman-alpha
variability is unlikely to significantly affect those detections. The HI atoms
must necessarily have velocities above the escape velocities and/or be outside
the Roche lobe, given the lobe shape and orientation. Absorption by HI in
HD209458b's atmosphere has thus been detected with different datasets, and now
with independent analyses. All these results strengthen the concept of
evaporating hot-Jupiters, as well as the modelization of this phenomenon.

multi-stranded model of a straight line-tied coronal loop. The transverse
geometry of our equilibrium configuration is quite irregular and more realistic
than the usual cylindrical loop model. By numerically solving the
time-dependent ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations in two dimensions we show
how the global motion of the whole bundle of strands, excited by an external
disturbance, is converted into localized Alfv\'enic motions due to the process
of resonant absorption. This process produces the attenuation of the transverse
oscillations. At any location in the structure two dominant frequencies are
found, the frequency of the global mode, or quasi-mode, and the local Alfv\'en
frequency. We find that the mechanism of mode conversion, due to the coupling
between fast and Alfv\'en waves, is not compromised by the complicated geometry
of the model. We also show that it is possible to have energy conversion not
only at the external edge of the composite loop but also inside the structure.
The implications of these results and their relationship with the observations
are discussed.

L1448-mm outflow has been interpreted as a signature of the magnetic precursor
of C-shocks. In contrast with the low SiO abundances (<10E-12) in the ambient
gas, the narrow SiO emission at almost ambient velocities reveals enhanced SiO
abundances of 10E-11. This enhancement has been proposed to be produced by the
sputtering of the grain mantles at the first stages of C-shocks. However,
modelling of the sputtering of grains has usually averaged the SiO abundances
over the dissipation region of C-shocks, which cannot explain the recent
observations. Aims: To model the evolution of the gas phase abundances of SiO,
CH3OH and H2O, produced by the sputtering of grains as the shock propagates
through the ambient gas. Methods: We propose a parametric model to describe the
physical structure of C-shocks as a function of time. Using the known
sputtering yields for water mantles (with minor constituents like silicon and
CH3OH) and olivine cores by collisions with H2, He, C, O, Si, Fe and CO, we
follow the evolution of the abundances of silicon, CH3OH and H2O ejected from
grains. Results: The evolution of these abundances shows that CO seems to be
the most efficient sputtering agent in low velocity shocks. The velocity
threshold for the sputtering of silicon from the grain mantles is reduced by
5-10 km s-1 by CO compared to other models. The sputtering by CO can generate
SiO abundances of 10E-11 at the early stages of low velocity shocks, consistent
with those observed in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm. Our model also
satisfactorily reproduce the progressive enhancement of SiO, CH3OH and H2O
observed in this outflow by the coexistence of two shocks with vs=30 and
60kms-1 within the same region.

reversal dynamics of these artificial domains by measuring major and minor
hysteresis loops. The coercive field of regions irradiated with identical doses
systematically increases as their size decreases. In the lower branch of minor
loops, reversal is seen to occur via a few large Barkhausen events. Preliminary

several contradictions arising between the assumption of a joint distribution

the second model on an equivalence class by which different configurations lead
to the same physical predictions.

The statistic we employ is the relative density of the PCD. When scaled
properly, the relative density of the PCD is a $U$-statistic. We derive the
asymptotic distribution of the relative density, using the standard central
limit theory of $U$-statistics. The finite sample performance of the test
statistic is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations, and the asymptotic
performance is assessed via Pitman's asymptotic efficiency, thereby yielding
the optimal parameters for testing. Furthermore, the methodology discussed in
this article is also valid for data in multiple dimensions.

various researches in physics, condensed matter, plasmas, atoms and molecules,

as perturbation theory. For example, there is no perturbative method to derive
arbitrary self-energy properly. In addition, the connection with other
formalism, e.g., the Matsubara imaginary-time perturbative formalism is
uncertain. Although there must be the relationship between self-energies in the
perturbative formalism, such basic problems remain to be solved. The solution
is given by the present work. The real-time perturbative expansion is performed
on the basis of the adiabatic theorem. As the results, the requirements of
self-energies as functions in time are demonstrated and the formulated
self-energies meet the known relations. Besides, it gives exact agreement with

various approximate relations between electron and photon spectral indices are
often used for energies both above and below electron low-energy cutoffs. We
examine the form of the exact relationships in various situations, and for
various cross-sections, showing that empirical relations sometimes used can be
highly misleading and consider how to improve fitting procedures. We obtain
expressions for photon spectra from single, double and truncated power-law
electron spectra for a variety of cross-sections and for the thin and thick
target models and simple analytic expressions for the Bethe-Heitler cases. We
show that above a low-energy cutoff the Kramers and Bethe-Heitler results match
reasonably well with results for exact cross-sections up to energies around 100
keV; that below the low-energy cutoff, Kramers and other constant spectral
index forms commonly used are very poor approximations to accurate results; but
that our analytical forms are a very good match. Analytical forms of the
Bethe-Heitler photon spectra from general power-law electron spectra are an
excellent match to exact results for both thin and thick targets and they
enable much faster spectral fitting than evaluation of the full spectral

proximity region associated with each data point and different graph statistics
can be employed for data reduction. The approach used in this article is based
on a parameterized family of proximity maps determining an associated family of
data-random digraphs. The relative arc density of the digraph is used as the
summary statistic, providing an alternative to the domination number employed
previously. An important advantage of the relative arc density is that,
properly re-scaled, it is a $U$-statistic, facilitating analytic study of its
asymptotic distribution using standard $U$-statistic central limit theory. The
approach is illustrated with an application to the testing of spatial patterns
of segregation and association. Knowledge of the asymptotic distribution allows
evaluation of the Pitman and Hodges-Lehmann asymptotic efficacies, and
selection of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficiency. Furthermore
the approach presented here also has the advantage of validity for data in any

methods as well as the Moeller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory, using
the basis set of Aug-cc-pVDZ quality and the CRENBL ECP effective core
potential for molecules containing heavy iodine atom. Possible isomers of
studied acids and supermolecules, consisting of acid molecules coupled with a
single water molecule, are shown. Energies, zero-point energies (ZPEs), thermal
enthalpies and free energies, as well as the corresponding binding energies for
the theoretical methods were calculated. It was found that optimized structures
of supermolecular isomers with lowest energies corresponding to the global
minimum on the potential energy surfaces can be different for both theories.
The simplest structure acids H2S and H2Se, forming acid-water supermolecules,
can give clear evidence of disagreement of the two theoretical methods
concerning optimization of lowest energy structures, because the B3LYP-DFT
method gives the lowest-energy structure for the first supermolecular isomer,
but the MP2 method for the second possible isomer. A dramatic difference
between potential energy surfaces for both theories applying to the optimized
structure finding of the H2SO3-H2O supermolecular isomers was found, because
MP2 supermolecular geometries cannot exist for the corresponding B3LYP-DFT
ones, for which the frequency characteristics of the supermolecular isomers
were also calculated. In general, the binding energies and ZPE ones for the MP2

simulations of astrophysical phenomena. Here, we present an approach to
numerical modeling of such objects on the example of Type Ia supernova
simulations. The evolution towards the explosion proceeds on much longer time
scales than the explosion process itself. The physical length scales relevant
in the explosion process cover 11 orders of magnitude and turbulent effects
dominate the physical mechanism. Despite these challenges, three-dimensional
simulations of Type Ia supernova explosions have recently become possible and
pave the way to a better understanding of these important astrophysical
objects.

benzenedithiol, benzenediamine, hexanedithiol and hexanediamine. Conductance
histograms under different experimental conditions indicate that measurements
using mechanically controllable break junctions in vacuum are limited by the
surface density of molecules at the contact. Hexanedithiol histograms typically
exhibit a broad peak around 7 * 10^{-4} G_0. In contrast to recent results on
STM-based break junctions in solution we find that the spread in
single-molecule conductance is not reduced by amino anchoring groups.
Histograms of hexanediamine exhibit a very wide peak around 4 * 10^{-4} G_0.
For both benzenedithiol and benzenediamine we observe a large variability in
low-bias conductance. We attribute these features to the slow breaking of the
lithographic mechanically controllable break junctions and the absence of a
solvent that may enable molecular readsorption after bond breaking.
Nevertheless, we have been able to acquire reproducible current-voltage
characteristics of benzenediamine and benzenedithiol using a statistical
measurement approach. Benzenedithiol measurements yield a conductance gap of
about 0.9 V at room temperature and 0.6 V at 77 K. In contrast, the
current-voltage characteristics of benzenediamine-junctions typically display
conductance gaps of about 0.9 V at both temperatures.

graduate students who are familiar with the basics of quantum field theory. We
begin with several derivations of the abelian anomaly: anomalous transformation
of the measure, explicit computation of the triangle Feynman diagram, relation
to the index of the Euclidean Dirac operator. The chiral (non-abelian) gauge
anomaly is derived by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram with three
non-abelian gauge fields coupled to a chiral fermion. We discuss in detail the
relation between anomaly, current non-conservation and non-invariance of the
effective action, with special emphasis on the derivation of the anomalous
Slavnov-Taylor/Ward identities. We show why anomalies always are finite and
local. A general characterization is given of gauge groups and fermion
representations which may lead to anomalies in four dimensions, and the issue
of anomaly cancellation is discussed, in particular the classical example of
the standard model.
  Then, we move to more formal developments and arbitrary even dimensions.
After introducing a few basic notions of differential geometry, in particular
characteristic classes, we derive the descent equations. We prove the
Wess-Zumino consistency condition and show that relevant anomalies correspond
to BRST cohomologies at ghost number one. We discuss why and how anomalies are
related to characteristic classes in two more dimensions and outline their
computation in terms of the index of an appropriate Dirac operator. Finally we
derive the gauge and gravitational anomalies in arbitrary even dimensions from
the appropriate index and explain the anomaly cancellations in ten-dimensional
IIB supergravity and in type I and heterotic superstrings.

discussed. In order to assess the applicability of the scheme for distant
entanglement generation between atomic qubits proposed by T.D. Ladd et al. [New
J. Phys. 8, 184 (2006)] to two distant quantum dots, one needs to understand
the limitations imposed by hyperfine interactions of the quantum dot spin with
the nuclear spins of the material and by non-identical quantum dots.
Feasibility is displayed by calculating the fidelity for Bell state generation
analytically within an approximate framework. The fidelity is evaluated for a
wide range of parameters and different pulse lengths, yielding a trade-off
between signal and decoherence, as well as a set of optimal parameters.
Strategies to overcome the effect of non-identical quantum dots on the fidelity
are examined and the timescales imposed by the nuclear spins are discussed,
showing that efficient entanglement generation is possible with distant quantum
dots. In this context, effects due to light hole transitions become important
and have to be included. The scheme is discussed for one- as well as for
two-sided cavities, where one must be careful with reflected light which
carries spin information. The validity of the approximate method is checked by
a more elaborate semiclassical simulation which includes trion formation.
