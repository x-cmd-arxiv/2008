  Shallow Water","A 27 page extended version (with 10 figures) of a two-page article
  submitted to the ICIAM 07 proceedings",,,"LA-UR 07-7482","math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The variational free-Lagrange (VFL) method for shallow water is a
free-Lagrange method with the additional property that it preserves the
variational structure of shallow water. The VFL method was first derived in
this context by \cite{AUG84} who discretized Hamilton's action principle with a
free-Lagrange data structure. The purpose of this article is to assess the
long-time conservation properties of the VFL method for regularized shallow
water which are useful for climate simulation. Long-time regularized shallow
water simulations show that the VFL method exhibits no secular drift in the (i)
energy error through the application of symplectic integrators; and (ii) the
potential vorticity error through the construction of discrete curl, divergence
and gradient operators which satisfy semi-discrete divergence and potential
vorticity conservation laws. These diagnostic semi-discrete equations augment
the description of the VFL method by characterizing the evolution of its
respective irrotational and solenoidal components in the Lagrangian frame. Like
the continuum equations, the former exhibits a $\text{div}^2\mathbf{U}$ term
which indicates that the flow has a very strong tendency towards a purely
rotational state.
  Numerical results show (i) the preservation of shape and strength of an
initially radially symmetric vortex pair in purely rotational regularized
shallow water and (ii) how the Voronoi diagram retains the history of the flow
field and (iii) that energy is conserved to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^2)$ and
potential vorticity error to within 5% with no secular growth over a 50 year
period.

superconducting or to two superconducting leads is studied for the domain of
bias voltages, V, exceeding the superconducting gap, 2\Delta. Due to the
on-site repulsion in the resonant level, cotunneling of an electron is
accompanied by creation of a quasiparticle in a superconducting lead. Energy
conservation imposes a threshold for this inelastic transport channel:
V_c=3\Delta for N-S case and \tilde{V}_c=4\Delta for the S-S case. We
demonstrate that the behavior of current near the respective thresholds is
nonanalytic, namely, \delta I^{in}(V)\propto (V-V_c)^{3/2}\Theta(V-V_c) and
\delta I^{in}(V) \propto (V-\tilde{V}_c)\Theta(V-\tilde{V}_c). Stronger anomaly
for the S-S leads is the consequence of the enhanced density of states at the
edges of the gap. In addition, the enhanced density of states makes the
threshold anomalies for two-electron cotunneling processes in the
Coulomb-blockaded regions more pronounced than for the N-N leads.

kinetics of the merging and splitting vortex loops. Because of very frequent
reconnections the vortex loops (as a whole) do not live long enough to perform
any essential evolution due to the deterministic motion. On the contrary, they
rapidly merge and split, and these random recombination processes prevail over
other slower dynamic processes. To develop quantitative description we take the
vortex loops to have a Brownian structure with the only degree of freedom,
which is the length $l$ of the loop. We perform investigation on the base of
the Boltzmann type kinetic equation for the distribution function $n(l)$ of
number of loops with length $l$. By use of the special ansatz in the collision
integral we have found the exact power-like solution to kinetic equation in the
stationary case. This solution is not (thermodynamically) equilibrium, but on
the contrary, it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length (or
energy) in space of sizes of the vortex loops. The term flux means just
redistribution of length (or energy) among the loops of different sizes due to
reconnections. Analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure
and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the turbulent superfluid helium. In
particular, we evaluated the mean radius of the curvature and the full rate of
the reconnection events. We also studied the evolution of the full length of
vortex loops per unit volume-the so-called vortex line density. It is shown
this evolution to obey the famous Vinen equation. The properties of the Vinen
equation from the point of view of the developed approach had been discussed.

symmetric, broad antisymmetric, and unipolar composite states - are unstable to
perturbations with real eigenvalues, while the other five families are stable.
The unstable states do not decay, but, instead, spontaneously transform
themselves into persistent breathers, which, in some cases, demonstrate
dynamical symmetry breaking and chaotic internal oscillations. A noteworthy
feature is a stability exchange between the broad and narrow antisymmetric
states: in the limit when the two channels merge into one, the former species
becomes stable, while the latter one loses its stability. Different branches of
the stationary states are linked by four bifurcations, which take different
forms in the model with the strong and weak inter-channel coupling.

Using the stress function method, we find modified stress functions for screw

of one independent length l1=l4. For the problem of an edge dislocation, only
two characteristic lengths l2 and l3 arise with one of them being the same
l2=l1 as for the screw dislocation. Thus, this theory possesses only two
independent lengths for generalized plane strain. If the two lengths l2 and l3

at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths are observable manifestations of such

optically thin high-Galactic-latitude clouds, which is designed to study the
surface brightness, structure, and spectral energy distribution of these
objects. The primary aim of this paper is to study the extended red emission
(ERE) that has been reported at high Galactic latitudes in earlier
investigations and which is attributed to ultraviolet-excited photoluminescence
of an as yet unidentified component of interstellar dust. We find strong
evidence for dust emission in the form of a broad (>1000 A FWHM) ERE band with
peak emission near 600 nm wavelength and peak intensity of ~ 5x10^-9 (erg cm^-2
s^-1 A^-1 sr^-1) in optically-thin clouds. This amounts to about 30% of the
total optical surface brightness of these clouds, the remainder being
consistent with expectations for dust-scattered light. This supports claims for
the ubiquitous presence of the ERE carrier throughout the diffuse interstellar
medium of the Milky Way Galaxy. We suggest that the ERE carrier is involved in
the radiative processing of about 20% to 30% of the dust-absorbed UV/optical
luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy, with the bulk of this energy being emitted
in the near- to mid-infrared spectral regions.

states at filling $\nu=\frac k {kM+2}$ are known to be exact ground states of a
local repulsive $k+1$-body interaction, and in the TT limit this is manifested
in that all states in the ground state manifold have exactly $k$ particles on
any $kM+2$ consecutive sites. For $M\neq 0$ the two-body correlations of these
states also imply that there is no more than one particle on $M$ adjacent
sites. The fractionally charged quasiparticles and quasiholes appear as domain
walls between the ground states, and we show that the number of distinct domain
wall patterns gives rise to the nontrivial degeneracies, required by the
non-abelian statistics of these states. In the second part of the paper we
consider the quasihole degeneracies from a conformal field theory (CFT)

information which is broadcast into many parts of the environment can be
encoded in a single observable. This supports a model of decoherence where the
pointer observable can be an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM).
This generalization makes it possible to characterize the emergence of a
realistic classical phase-space. In addition, this model clarifies the
relationships among the information preserved in the system, the information
flowing from the system to the environment (measurement), and the establishment
of correlations between the system and the environment.

Observations indicate a strong link between star formation and black
hole (BH) growth, but some questions remain unanswered: whether both activities
are coeval or whether one precedes the other, what their characteristic
timescales are, and what kinds of physical processes are responsible for this
interplay.
  Aims. We examine stellar and BH masses (M_star and M_BH) in z~2 active
systems at the peak of their AGN or star formation activity to investigate how
they are linked and whether AGN radiative or else radio power provides a
feedback mechanism that regulates the stellar growth in these systems.
  Methods. We analyze the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions of radio,
sub-millimeter and mid-IR selected AGNs at z~1-3 and constrain their stellar
and AGN luminosities using AGN and host-galaxy templates.
  Results. We find evidence of increasing stellar light, thereby decreasing the
AGN mid-IR power going from mid-IR selected AGNs, to radio galaxies, and to
sub-millimeter AGNs. This trend can be explained by either decreasing Eddington
ratios or increasing offsets from the local M_BH-M_star relation. All systems
are characterized by high star formation rates regardless of their different
AGN powers, thus neither AGN radiative power nor AGN-driven radio activity
seems to influence the star formation rate in the selected AGNs. We discuss two
possible evolutionary scenarios that might link these three AGN classes.

quite encouraging result is the appearance of an asymmetry between the

presents a nonlinear correction, which is absent for the ions, and makes the
radial electron coefficients much larger than the former. Explicit calculations

practical cloak of finite mass is defined in terms of its effective visible

when the effective visible radius is subwavelength, reducing the total

10^6 to 10^8 M_sun have been discovered during the past decade. These so-called
ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical
star clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and
V-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios. Using new data, we find that the mass
interval from 10^6 to 10^7 M_sun is of special interest, because within this
range typical half-light radii and dynamical mass-to-light ratios begin to
increase compared to globular clusters, the highest stellar densities are
reached and typical median two-body relaxation times surpass a Hubble time. The
M/L_V ratios of the UCDs turn out to be incompatible with the predictions from
simple stellar population (SSP) models when using the canonical stellar initial
mass function (IMF), although SSPs probably are good approximations to the real
stellar populations in UCDs and the SSP models allow to account for metallicity
effects on the M/L_V ratio. This provides evidence for the UCDs either having
formed with an IMF different from the canonical one or containing dark matter.
We emphasise that almost all pressure-supported stellar systems ranging from
star clusters to massive elliptical galaxies have M/L_V ratios less than 10
M_sun/L_sun, and that only dSph satellite galaxies have M/L_V ratios greater
than 100 M_sun/L_sun and therewith form exceptional systems.

intermediate mass stars, in all of which we spectrally resolve the 6300
Angstrom [OI] emission line. Two of these have a double peaked line profile. We
fit these data with a simple model of the [OI] emission caused by
photo-dissociation of OH molecules in the upper layer of a circumstellar disk
by stellar UV radiation and thus translate the Doppler broadened [OI] emission
profile into an amount of emission as a function of distance from the central
star. The resulting spectra are in agreement with the expected disk shapes as
derived from their spectral energy distribution. We find evidence for shadowing
by an inner rim in the disk surrounding HD101412 and see a flaring disk
structure in HD179218 while the [OI] spectrum of HD135344 is more complex. The
[OI] emission starts for all three targets at velocities corresponding to their
dust sublimation radius and extends up to radii of 10 -- 90 AU. This shows that
this method can be a valuable tool in the future investigation of circumstellar
disks.

emission from a region within $\sim 20^0$ of the galactic center (the {\it WMAP

neutralino self-annihilation; on the basis of this possible occurrence, also
upper bounds on the neutralino self-annihilation cross--section are suggested.
In the present note, we show that in the common case of thermal WIMPs in a
standard cosmological model, when the rescaling of the galactic WIMP density is
duly taken into account for subdominant WIMPs, the upper bound applicable
generically to {\it any} signal due to self-conjugate WIMPs is more stringent
than the ones obtained from analysis of the WMAP haze. We also argue that an
experimental upper bound, which can compete with our generic upper limit, can
rather be derived from measurements of cosmic antiproton fluxes, for some
values of the parameters of the astrophysical propagation model. Finally, we
comment on the possible impact of our generic upper bound on the interpretation
of the WMAP haze in terms of thermal neutralinos in a standard cosmological
scheme.

indicate the presence of additional planets in the system that are yet
undetected, potentially with masses approaching an Earth mass. The MOST data
sets of HD 209458 from 2004 and 2005 represent unprecedented time coverage with
nearly continuous observations spanning 14 and 43 days and monitoring 3
transits and 12 consecutive transits, respectively. The transit times we obtain
show no variations on three scales: (a) no long-term change in P since before
2004 at the 25 ms level, (b) no trend in transit timings during the 2005 run,
and (c) no individual transit timing deviations above 80 sec level. Together
with previously published transit times from Agol & Steffen (2007), this allows
us to place limits on the presence of additional close-in planets in the
system, in some cases down to below an Earth mass. This result, along with
previous radial velocity work, now eliminates the possibility that a perturbing

characterized by steady Lorentz factor Gamma is considered. Photons that are
injected in regions of high optical depth are advected with the flow until they
escape at the photosphere. Below the photosphere, the photons are coupled to
the plasma via Compton scattering. I show here, that as a result of the slight
misalignment of the scattering electrons velocity vectors, the (local) comoving
photon energy decreases with radius as epsilon'(r) ~ r^{-2/3}. This mechanism
dominates the photon cooling in scenarios of faster adiabatic cooling of the
electrons. I then show that the photospheric radius of a relativistically
expanding plasma wind strongly depends on the angle to the line of sight,
theta. For theta <~ 1/Gamma, r_{ph} is theta independent, while for theta >~
1/Gamma, r_{ph} ~ theta^2. I show that the theta dependence of the photosphere
implies that for flow parameters characterizing GRBs, thermal photons
originating from below the photosphere can be observed up to tens of seconds
following the inner engine activity decay. I calculate the probability density
function P(r,theta) of a thermal photon to escape the plasma at radius r and
angle theta. Using this function, I show that following the termination of the
internal photon injection mechanism, the thermal flux decreases as F_{BB}^{ob.}
~ t^{-2}, and that the decay of the photon energy with radius results in a
power law decay of the observed temperature, T^{ob.}(t) ~ t^{-2/3} at early
times, which changes to t^{-1/2} later. Detailed numerical results are in very
good agreement with the analytical predictions. I discuss the consequences of
this temporal behavior in view of the recent evidence for a thermal emission
component observed during the prompt emission phase of GRBs.

model is numerically studied using the cell dynamics method. Whole process from
nucleation to growth is simulated and is shown to follow closely the
Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) scenario of phase transformation.
Specifically the time evolution of the volume fraction of new stable phase is
found to follow closely the KJMA formula. By fitting the KJMA formula directly
to the simulation data, not only the Avrami exponent but the magnitude of
nucleation rate and, in particular, of incubation time are quantitatively
studied. The modified Avrami plot is also used to verify the derived KJMA
parameters. It is found that the Avrami exponent is close to the ideal
theoretical value m=3. The temperature dependence of nucleation rate follows
the activation-type behavior expected from the classical nucleation theory. On
the other hand, the temperature dependence of incubation time does not follow
the exponential activation-type behavior. Rather the incubation time is
inversely proportional to the temperature predicted from the theory of
Shneidman and Weinberg [J. Non-Cryst. Solids {\bf 160}, 89 (1993)]. A need to
restrict thermal noise in simulation to deduce correct Avrami exponent is also
discussed.

absence of molecular hydrogen absorption lines, a surprising result in light of
their large neutral hydrogen column densities and the detection of H$_2$ in
similar, more local star-forming regions like 30 Doradus in the Large

of the neutral hydrogen column in these sight lines lies 100 pc beyond the
progenitor and that H$_2$ was absent prior to the burst, suggesting that direct
flux from the star, FUV background fields, or both suppressed its formation. We
present one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical models of GRB host galaxy

galactic Lyman-Werner background is required to dissociate the molecular
hydrogen in the ambient ISM. Intensities of 0.1 - 100 times the Galactic mean
are necessary to destroy H$_2$ in the cloud, depending on its density and

an analytical framework to characterize the capacity of MIMO communication
systems in the presence of multiple MIMO co-channel interferers and noise. We
consider the situation in which transmitters have no information about the
channel and all links undergo Rayleigh fading. We first generalize the known
determinant representation of hypergeometric functions with matrix arguments to
the case when the argument matrices have eigenvalues of arbitrary multiplicity.
This enables the derivation of the distribution of the eigenvalues of Gaussian
quadratic forms and Wishart matrices with arbitrary correlation, with
application to both single user and multiuser MIMO systems. In particular, we
derive the ergodic mutual information for MIMO systems in the presence of
multiple MIMO interferers. Our analysis is valid for any number of interferers,
each with arbitrary number of antennas having possibly unequal power levels.
This framework, therefore, accommodates the study of distributed MIMO systems
and accounts for different positions of the MIMO interferers.

mechanics does not contradict philosophical realism by throwing light onto
certain properties of quantum systems that seem to have escaped attention as
yet. The exposition starts with the philosophical notions of realism. Then, the
quantum mechanics as it is usually taught is demoted to a mere part of the
theory called phenomenology of observations, and the common impression about
its contradiction to realism is explained. The main idea of the paper, the
physical notion of intrinsic properties, is introduced and many examples
thereof are given. It replaces the irritating dichotomy of quantum and
classical worlds by a much softer difference between intrinsic and extrinsic
properties, which concern equally microscopic and macroscopic systems. Finally,
the classicality and the quantum measurement are analyzed and found to present
some still unsolved problems. A possible way of dealing with the

simple quantum model of one classical property illustrates how our philosophy
may work.

of a multiply connected manifold $M$ and $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of

operator on $M=\tilde{M}/\Gamma$, called $H_\Lambda$, which formally
corresponds to the same differential operator as $H$ but which is determined by
quasi-periodic boundary conditions. We give a brief review of the Bloch

the Hamiltonians $H_\Lambda$ and $H$. Then we concentrate on the example of the
Aharonov-Bohm effect with two vortices. We explain in detail the construction
of the propagator in this case and indicate all essential intermediate steps.

instabilities of mechanical systems. Taking into account the effect of
geometric nonlinearity in the equations of motion through the geometric
stiffness matrix, the problem is reduced to a generalized eigenproblem where
both the loading multiplier and the natural frequency of the system are
unknown. According to this approach, all the forms of instabilities
intermediate between those of pure buckling and pure forced resonance can be
investigated. Numerous examples are analyzed, including: discrete mechanical
systems with one to n degrees of freedom, continuous mechanical systems such as
oscillating deflected beams subjected to a compressive axial load, as well as
oscillating beams subjected to lateral-torsional buckling. A general finite
element procedure is also outlined, with the possibility to apply the proposed
approach to any general bi- or tri-dimensional framed structure. The proposed
results provide a new insight in the interpretation of coupled phenomena such
as flutter instability of long-span or high-rise structures.

signatures of intermittency in a turbulent velocity field: (1) the non-Gaussian
tails in the CVI PDF grow as the lag decreases, (2) the departure from
Kolmogorov scaling of the high-order structure functions is more pronounced in
the more turbulent field, (3) the positions contributing to the CVI PDF tails
delineate narrow filamentary structures (thickness ~ 0.02 pc), uncorrelated to
dense gas structures and spatially coherent with thicker ones (~0.18 pc)
observed on larger scales. The confrontation with theoretical predictions leads
us to identify these small-scale filamentary structures with extrema of
velocity-shears associated with gas warmer than the bulk. Last, their average
direction is parallel (or close) to that of the local magnetic field
projection. Turbulence in these translucent fields exhibits the statistical and
structural signatures of small-scale and inertial-range intermittency. The more
turbulent field on the 30 pc-scale is also the more intermittent on small

are amazingly simple and well-understood. This fact allows us to take into
account a very large variety of processes, still finding potentially measurable
consequences. In this contribution we highlight some of the detailed physics
that were recently studied in connection with cosmological hydrogen and helium
recombination. The impact of these considerations is two-fold: (i) the
associated release of photons during this epoch leads to interesting and unique
deviations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody, which, in particular at decimeter wavelength, may become
observable in the near future. Despite the fact that the abundance of helium is
rather small, it also contributes a sizeable amount of photons to the full
recombination spectrum, which, because of differences in the dynamics of the
helium recombinations and the non-trivial superposition of all components, lead
to additional distinct spectral features. Observing the spectral distortions
from the epochs of hydrogen and helium recombination, in principle would
provide an additional way to determine some of the key parameters of the
Universe (e.g. the specific entropy, the CMB monopole temperature and the
pre-stellar abundance of helium), not suffering from limitations set by cosmic
variance. Also it permits us to confront our detailed understanding of the
recombination process with direct observational evidence. (ii) with the advent
of high precision CMB data, e.g. as will be available using the Planck Surveyor
or CMBpol, a very accurate theoretical understanding of the ionization history
of the Universe becomes necessary for the interpretation of the CMB temperature
and polarization anisotropies. (abridged)

7009 with 297 spatial pixels per target were obtained at sub-arcsec resolutions
and 297 spectra per target were obtained in the 396.4-507.8 nm range. Spatially
resolved maps of emission lines and of nebular physical properties were
produced. The abundances of helium and of doubly ionized carbon and oxygen were
derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs), while those of O^2+ were also
derived from the collisionally excited lines (CELs). The abundance discrepancy
problem was investigated by mapping the ratio of ORL/CEL abundances for O^2+
(the abundance discrepancy factor; ADF) across the face of the PNe. The ADF
varies between targets and also with position within the targets attaining
values of ~40 in the case of NGC 6153. Correlations of the ADF with geometric
distance from the nucleus, as well as with [O III] electron temperature, plasma
ionization state and other physical properties are established. Very small
values of the temperature fluctuation parameter in the plane of the sky are
found in all cases. It is argued that these results provide further evidence
for the existence in typical PNe of a distinct nebular component consisting of
hydrogen-deficient plasma. The zones containing this posited component appear
as undulations in the C II and C II ORL abundance diagnostics of about 2
spatial pixels across; any associated structures should have physical sizes of
less than ~1000 astronomical units. We propose that circumstellar disks, Abell
30-type knots, or Helix-type cometary globules may be involved.

receiving their signals, compress them using a multi-source lossy compression

users' decoding. Distributed Wyner-Ziv coding is proposed to be used, and is
optimally designed in this work. The first part of the paper is devoted to a
network with a unique multi-antenna user, that transmits a predefined Gaussian

metric. In particular, for $N = 1$ the optimum codebook distribution is derived

intensities of hyperfine spectral components due to optical pumping is
presented. Hyperfine levels of sodium $3p_{1/2}$ and $3p_{3/2}$ levels are
selectively excited in a supersonic beam at various laser intensities under the
conditions when optical pumping time is shorter than transit time of atoms
through the laser beam. The excitation spectra exhibit significant line
broadening at laser intensities well below the saturation intensity, and
redistribution of intensities of hyperfine spectral components is observed,
which in some cases is contradicting with intuitive expectations. Theoretical
analysis of the dynamics of optical pumping shows that spectral line broadening
depends sensitively on branching coefficient of the laser-driven transition.
Analytical expressions for branching ratio dependent critical Rabi frequency
and critical laser intensity are derived, which give the threshold for onset of
noticeable line broadening by optical pumping. Transitions with larger and
smaller branching coefficients are relatively less affected. The theoretical
excitation spectra were calculated numerically by solving density matrix
equations of motion using the split propagation technique, and they well
reproduce the observed effects of line broadening and peak intensity
variations. The calculations also show that presence of dark (i.e., not laser-
coupled) Zeeeman sublevels in the lower state results in effective branching
coefficients which vary with laser intensity and differ from those implied by
the sum rules, and this can lead to peculiar changes in peak ratios of
hyperfine components of the spectra.

approximate analytical solutions that are valid in the limits where the

fraction of energy flux that is carried away in each oscillation cycle by
running acoustic waves in the atmosphere and running magnetic waves in the

most energy losses associated with the presence of running waves occur in
regions where the magnetic field is close to vertical. Moreover, by considering
the depth dependence of the energy associated with the magnetic component of

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely associated with low metallicity, rapidly

below a critical metallicity Z_crit Z_sun/10 - Z_sun/5, to estimate the event
rate of high-redshift long GRB progenitors. To this purpose, we exploit a
galaxy formation scenario already successfully tested on a wealth of
observational data on (proto)spheroids, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman alpha
emitters, submm galaxies, quasars, and local early-type galaxies. We find that
the predicted rate of long GRBs amounts to about 300 events/yr/sr, of which
about 30 per cent occur at z>~6. Correspondingly, the GRB number counts well
agree with the bright SWIFT data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosity
evolution. Moreover, the above framework enables us to predict properties of
the GRB host galaxies. Most GRBs are associated with low mass galaxy halos
M_H<~10^11 M_sun, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in such
halos. The hosts are young, with age smaller than 5*10^7 yr, gas rich, but
poorly extincted (A_V<~0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this also
implies high specific SFR and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. Only the
minority of hosts residing in large halos with M_H>~10^12 M_sun have larger
extinction (A_V~0.7-1), SFRs exceeding 100 M_sun/yr and can be detected at
submm wavelengths. Most of the hosts have UV magnitudes in the range -20
<~M_1350<~ -16, and Lyman alpha luminosity in the range 2*10^40

The results show that doping leads to significant local distortions of the

from x = 0 to x = 0.75 new bands appear and grow in intensity in both the IR
and Raman spectra, showing that the local distortions become successively more
and more pronounced. The structural distortions are largely uncorrelated to the
presence of oxygen vacancies, but instead are mainly driven by the size
difference between the In^{3+} and Zr^{4+} ions, which leads to displacements
of the cations and to tilting of the (In/Zr)O_{6} octahedra. Based on our
results, we suggest that there is a threshold between x = 0.10 and x = 0.25

present the most suitable candidates for future channeling experiments with

polarization of carbon valence electrons in the presence of various surrounding
dielectric media affects the angular distributions of protons channeled through
(11,~9) single-wall carbon nanotubes. Proton speeds between 3 and 10 a.u.,
corresponding to energies of 0.223 and 2.49 MeV, are chosen with the nanotube's
length varied between 0.1 and 1 $\mu$m. We describe the repulsive interaction
between a proton and the nanotube's atoms in a continuum-potential
approximation based on the Doyle-Turner potential, whereas the attractive image
force on a proton is calculated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model for
the dynamic response of the nanotube valence electrons, while assigning to the
surrounding medium an appropriate (frequency dependent) dielectric function.
The angular distributions of channeled protons are generated using a computer
simulation method which solves the proton equations of motion in the transverse
plane numerically. Our analysis shows that the presence of a dielectric medium
can strongly affect both the appearance and positions of maxima in the angular
distributions of channeled protons.

fields of mathematical research. Nevertheless basic algebraic tools, in order
to further develop the theory, are far from being established. In this thesis
we introduce a notion of exactness for exact sequences of pointed n-groupoids.
Furthermore we test it generalizing a well known result for (fibrations of)
groupoids [R.Brown, 1970]. Namely, given a fibration F of (pointed) groupoids
and its strict kernel it is possible to obtain a 6-term exact sequence of
groups (of loops) and pointed sets (iso classes of objects). The ziqqurath, aka
step-pyramid, comes out from iterating this construction, and it consists in
several sequences of n-groupoids, (n-1)-groupoids and so on up to pointed sets
(0-groupoids), of increasing length.

  Projections",,,,,"cs.DS cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose skewed stable random projections for approximating the pth
frequency moments of dynamic data streams (0<p<=2), which has been frequently
studied in theoretical computer science and database communities. Our method
significantly (or even infinitely when p->1) improves previous methods based on
(symmetric) stable random projections.
  Our proposed method is applicable to data streams that are (a) insertion only
(the cash-register model); or (b) always non-negative (the strict Turnstile
model), or (c) eventually non-negative at check points. This is only a minor
restriction for practical applications.
  Our method works particularly well when p = 1+/- \Delta and \Delta is small,
which is a practically important scenario. For example, \Delta may be the decay
rate or interest rate, which are usually small. Of course, when \Delta = 0, one
can compute the 1th frequent moment (i.e., the sum) essentially error-free
using a simple couter. Our method may be viewed as a ``genearlized counter'' in
that it can count the total value in the future, taking in account of the
effect of decaying or interest accruement.
  In a summary, our contributions are two-fold. (A) This is the first propsal
of skewed stable random projections. (B) Based on first principle, we develop
various statistical estimators for skewed stable distributions, including their
variances and error (tail) probability bounds, and consequently the sample
complexity bounds.

star or a black hole) and a relatively normal star orbit a common centre of
mass. Since the discovery of X-ray binaries with the first X-ray telescopes in
the 1960s, astronomers have tried to understand how these bizarre objects
behave, and why. Some change in X-ray luminosity by 10^8 orders of magnitude on
timescales of days to months due to an increased transfer of mass from the star
towards the compact object. Many X-ray binaries are detected at all observable
frequencies, from radio to gamma-rays. It has been found that many different
sources of emission, which peak at different frequencies, are present in X-ray
binary spectra and together they produce the observed broadband spectrum.
However, disentangling these components has proved challenging. Much of the
work in this thesis concerns disentangling the components that occupy the
optical and near-infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum of X-ray binaries;
possibly the region in which the relative contributions of the different
components are least certain. In particular one component, the synchrotron
emission from jets of outflowing matter, is found in this work to contribute
ubiquitously to the optical and NIR light of X-ray binaries with relatively
faint stars. These results confirm that the jets are powerful and in some of
this work, observations of the jets interacting with the surrounding matter are
used to infer their power.

drifted across the spectrum; three 22 min integrations made at 78 ms time

  Laurent Mazet (LAMA)","Characterizations of Lojasiewicz inequalities and applications",,,,,"math.OC math.DS",,"  The classical Lojasiewicz inequality and its extensions for partial
differential equation problems (Simon) and to o-minimal structures (Kurdyka)
have a considerable impact on the analysis of gradient-like methods and related
problems: minimization methods, complexity theory, asymptotic analysis of
dissipative partial differential equations, tame geometry. This paper provides
alternative characterizations of this type of inequalities for nonsmooth lower
semicontinuous functions defined on a metric or a real Hilbert space. In a
metric context, we show that a generalized form of the Lojasiewicz inequality
(hereby called the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality) relates to metric regularity
and to the Lipschitz continuity of the sublevel mapping, yielding applications
to discrete methods (strong convergence of the proximal algorithm). In a
Hilbert setting we further establish that asymptotic properties of the semiflow
generated by $-\partial f$ are strongly linked to this inequality. This is done
by introducing the notion of a piecewise subgradient curve: such curves have
uniformly bounded lengths if and only if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality is
satisfied. Further characterizations in terms of talweg lines -a concept linked
to the location of the less steepest points at the level sets of $f$- and
integrability conditions are given. In the convex case these results are
significantly reinforced, allowing in particular to establish the asymptotic
equivalence of discrete gradient methods and continuous gradient curves. On the
other hand, a counterexample of a convex C^2 function in in the plane is
constructed to illustrate the fact that, contrary to our intuition, and unless
a specific growth condition is satisfied, convex functions may fail to fulfill
the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality.

(LSMO) as ferromagnetic metallic electrodes and the undoped parent compound
LaMnO$_3$ (LMO) as insulating barrier, is here theoretically discussed using
double exchange model Hamiltonians and numerical techniques. For an even number
of LMO layers, the ground state is shown to have anti-parallel LSMO magnetic
moments. This highly resistive, but fragile, state is easily destabilized by
small magnetic fields, which orient the LSMO moments in the direction of the
field. The magnetoresistance associated with this transition is very large,
according to Monte Carlo and Density Matrix Renormalization Group studies. The
influence of temperature, the case of an odd number of LMO layers, and the
differences between LMO and SrTiO$_3$ as barriers are also addressed. General
trends are discussed.

Raman. Another reason leading to large fluctuations is the interference of
output pulses.
