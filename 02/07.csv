13CO abundance within Perseus. We divide Perseus into six sub-regions. The
standard X factor, X=N(H2)/W(12CO), is derived both for the whole Perseus
Complex and for each of the six sub-regions with values consistent with
previous estimates. The X factor is heavily affected by the saturation of the
emission above AV~4 mag, and variations are found between regions. We derive
linear fits to relate W(12CO) and AV using only points below 4 mag of
extinction, this yields a better estimation of the AV than the X-factor. We
derive linear relations of W(13CO), N(13CO) and W(C18O) with AV . The
extinction threshold above which 13CO(1-0) and C18O(1-0) are detected is about
1 mag larger than previous estimates. 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) lines saturate
above 4 and 5 mag, respectively, whereas C18O(1-0) never saturates (up to 10
mag). Approximately 60% of the positions with 12CO emission have sub-thermally
excited lines, and almost all positions have 12CO excitation temperatures below
the dust temperature. Using the Meudon PDR code we find that 12CO and 13CO
emission can be explained by uniform slab models with densities ranging between
about 10^3 and 10^4 cm-3. Local variations in the volume density and
non-thermal motions (linked to different star formation activity) can explain
the observations. Higher densities are needed to reproduce CO data toward
active star forming sites, where the larger internal motions driven by the
young protostars allow more photons from the embedded high density cores to
escape the cloud. In the most quiescent region, the 12CO and 13CO emission
appears to arise from an almost uniform thin layer of molecular material at
densities around 10^4 cm-3.

positive side, the minimal penalty can be evaluated from the data themselves,
leading to a data-driven estimation of an optimal penalty which can be used in
practice; on the negative side, their approach heavily relies on the
homoscedastic Gaussian nature of their stochastic framework. The purpose of
this paper is twofold: stating a more general heuristics for designing a
data-driven penalty (the slope heuristics) and proving that it works for
penalized least-squares regression with a random design, even for
heteroscedastic non-Gaussian data. For technical reasons, some exact
mathematical results will be proved only for regressogram bin-width selection.

vortices attract each other (gravity case). We derive the stochastic equation
satisfied by the exact vorticity field and the Fokker-Planck equation satisfied
by the N-body distribution function. We present the BBGKY-like hierarchy of
equations satisfied by the reduced distribution functions and close the
hierarchy by considering an expansion of the solutions in powers of 1/N, where
N is the number of vortices, in a proper thermodynamic limit. For spatially
inhomogeneous systems, we derive the kinetic equations satisfied by the smooth
vorticity field in a mean field approximation valid for $N\to +\infty$. For
spatially homogeneous systems, we study the two-body correlation function, in a
Debye-H\""uckel approximation valid at the order O(1/N). The results of this
paper can also apply to other systems of random walkers with long-range
interactions such as self-gravitating Brownian particles and bacterial
populations experiencing chemotaxis. Furthermore, for positive temperatures,
our study provides a kinetic derivation, from microscopic stochastic processes,
of the Debye-H\""uckel model of electrolytes.

literature on group formation assumes that individuals may join any existing
group. In this paper, I consider the implications of social, geographic, and
informational constraints to group membership decisions. I embed the players in
a network of relationships, which constrains their choice of groups--they may
only join a group if that group contains a member that they are connected to on
the network. I then examine how this network constraint affects the equilibrium
group structure. I show that even with complete information, unconstrained
individuals form groups that are inefficiently large. When individuals are
constrained, the resulting group structures are much closer to the socially
optimal group structure, because the constraint limits the ability of the
individual to free ride on the efforts of other group members. The efficiency
of the outcome is related to the structure of the network constraint--outcomes
are more efficient when networks are sparse and have few random connections.

flavors of domain-wall fermions, resulting in good control of chiral symmetry
breaking. Non-perturbative renormalization of the relevant quark currents is
performed where necessary. The inverse lattice spacing, $a^{-1}$, is about 1.7
GeV. We use degenerate up and down dynamical quark masses around 1, 3/4 and 1/2
the strange quark mass. The physical volume of the lattice is about
$(1.9{fm})^3$. The ratio of the isovector vector to axial charges, $g_A/g_V$,
trends a bit lower than the experimental value as the quark mass is reduced
toward the physical point. We calculate the momentum-transfer dependences of
the isovector vector, axial, induced tensor and induced pseudoscalar form
factors. The Goldberger-Treiman relation holds at low momentum transfer and
yields a pion-nucleon coupling, $g_{\pi NN} = 15.5(1.4)$, where the quoted
error is only statistical. We find that the flavor non-singlet quark momentum

semantics and their type assignment calculi, are specified by describing
appropriate proof systems. Recent research has identified two proof-theoretic
features that allow direct, logic-based reasoning about such descriptions: the
treatment of atomic judgments as fixed points (recursive definitions) and an
encoding of binding constructs via generic judgments. However, the logics
encompassing these two features have thus far treated them orthogonally: that
is, they do not provide the ability to define object-logic properties that
themselves depend on an intrinsic treatment of binding. We propose a new and
simple integration of these features within an intuitionistic logic enhanced
with induction over natural numbers and we show that the resulting logic is
consistent. The pivotal benefit of the integration is that it allows recursive
definitions to not just encode simple, traditional forms of atomic judgments
but also to capture generic properties pertaining to such judgments. The
usefulness of this logic is illustrated by showing how it can provide elegant
treatments of object-logic contexts that appear in proofs involving typing
calculi and of arbitrarily cascading substitutions that play a role in
reducibility arguments.

Spectrum Radio Quasars is widely associated with the inverse Compton (IC)

Broad Line Region, by high-energy electrons in a relativistic jet. In the
modelling of the IC spectrum one usually adopts a simple black-body
approximation for the external radiation field, though the real shape is
probably more complex. The knowledge of the detailed spectrum of the external
radiation field would allow to better characterize the soft-medium X-ray IC
spectrum, which is crucial to address several issues related to the study of
these sources. Here we present a first step in this direction, calculating the
IC spectra expected by considering a realistic spectrum for the external
radiation energy density produced by the BLR, as calculated with the
photoionization code CLOUDY. We find that, under a wide range of the physical
parameters characterizing the BLR clouds, the IC spectrum calculated with the
black-body approximation reproduces quite well the exact spectrum for energies
above few keV. In the soft energy band, instead, the IC emission calculated
using the BLR emission shows a complex shape, with a moderate excess with
respect to the approximate spectrum, which becomes more important for
decreasing values of the peak frequency of the photoionizing continuum. We also
show that the high-energy spectrum shows a marked steepening, due to the energy
dependence of the scattering cross section, above a characteristic energy of
10-20 GeV, quasi independent on the Lorentz factor of the jet.

show almost no dependence of axial ratio on galaxy colour, implying a
negligible dust optical depth.
  There is a strong variation of spiral galaxy shapes with colour indicating
the presence of dust. The intrinsic shapes of spiral galaxies in the SDSS-DR6
are consistent with flat disks with a mean and dispersion of thickness to
diameter ratio of (21+-2)%, and a face-on ellipticity, e, of ln(e)=-2.33+-0.79.

a time polynomially long in the size of the quantum circuit has passed, the

jets carry away very little of the accreting matter, a larger proportion of the

quantitatively that the conditions required to grow a rapidly spinning black
hole to a mass ~ 10^9 solar masses by redshift z ~ 6, whilst satisfying the
observational constraint e_r > 0.1, are considerably less restrictive for
jet-enhanced disc accretion than for standard disc accretion, which requires
implausibly high super-Eddington accretion rates. Furthermore, jet-enhanced

perturbative monopole solution for Kerr parameter a up to the second order

the comparison between the numerical solution that is valid for 0<a<1 and the

Alfv\'{e}n-cyclotron fluctuations in solar plasmas numerically. Motivated by
wave-wave couplings and nonlinear effects, we test several forms of the
diffusion tensor. For a general locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion
tensor in the wave vector space, the turbulence spectrum in the inertial range
can be fitted with power-laws with the power-law index varying with the wave
propagation direction. For several locally isotropic but inhomogeneous
diffusion coefficients, the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly
isotropic in the absence of damping and can be fitted by a single power-law
function. However, the energy flux is strongly polarized due to the
inhomogeneity that leads to an anisotropic cascade. Including the anisotropic
thermal damping, the turbulence spectrum cuts off at the wave numbers, where
the damping rates become comparable to the cascade rates. The combined
anisotropic effects of cascade and damping make this cutoff wave number
dependent on the wave propagation direction, and the propagation direction
integrated turbulence spectrum resembles a broken power-law, which cuts off at
the maximum of the cutoff wave numbers or the $^4$He cyclotron frequency.
Taking into account the Doppler effects, the model can naturally reproduce the
broken power-law wave spectra observed in the solar wind and predicts that a
higher break frequency is aways accompanied with a greater spectral index
change that may be caused by the increase of the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number, the
reciprocal of the plasma beta, and/or the angle between the solar wind velocity
and the mean magnetic field. These predictions can be tested by future

reconstructs a phylogenetic tree and ancestral sequences from extant data
(sequences at the leaves). The tree and ancestral sequences maximize the
probability of observing the given data under a Markov model of sequence
evolution, in which branch lengths are also optimized but constrained to take
the same value on any edge across all sequence sites. AML differs from the more
usual form of maximum likelihood (ML) in phylogenetics because ML averages over
all possible ancestral sequences. ML has long been known to be statistically
consistent -- that is, it converges on the correct tree with probability
approaching 1 as the sequence length grows. However, the statistical
consistency of AML has not been formally determined, despite informal remarks
in a literature that dates back 20 years. In this short note we prove a general
result that implies that AML is statistically inconsistent. In particular we
show that AML can `shrink' short edges in a tree, resulting in a tree that has
no internal resolution as the sequence length grows. Our results apply to any
number of taxa.

using linear analysis. An unperturbed state is a self-gravitating isothermal
layer which grows with time by the accretion of gas through shock fronts due to
a cloud-cloud collision. Since the unperturbed state is not static, and cannot
be described by a self-similar solution, we numerically solved the perturbation
equations and directly integrated them over time. We took account of the
distribution of physical quantities across the thickness. Linearized
Rankine-Hugoniot relations were imposed at shock fronts as boundary conditions.
The following results are found from our unsteady linear analysis: the
perturbation initially evolves in oscillatory mode, and begins to grow at a
certain epoch. The wavenumber of the fastest growing mode is given by
$k=2\sqrt{2\pi G\rho_\mathrm{E} {\cal M\mit}}/c_\mathrm{s}$, where
$\rho_\mathrm{E}, c_\mathrm{s}$ and $\cal M\mit$ are the density of parent
clouds, the sound velocity and the Mach number of the collision velocity,
respectively. For this mode, the transition epoch from oscillatory to growing
mode is given by $t_g = 1.2/\sqrt{2\pi G\rho_\mathrm{E} {\cal M\mit}}$. The
epoch at which the fastest growing mode becomes non-linear is given by
$2.4\delta_0^{-0.1}/\sqrt{2\pi G \rho_\mathrm{E}{\cal M\mit}}$, where
$\delta_0$ is the initial amplitude of the perturbation of the column density.
As an application of our linear analysis, we investigate criteria for
collision-induced fragmentation. Collision-induced fragmentation will occur
only when parent clouds are cold, or $\alpha_0=5c_\mathrm{s}^2 R/2G M < 1$,
where $R$ and $M$ are the radius and the mass of parent clouds, respectively.

the strong gravitational perturbations due to the companion increase encounter
velocities between planetesimals and make it difficult for them to grow through
accreting collisions. We study planetesimal encounter velocities in binary
systems, where the planetesimals are embedded in a circumprimary gas disc that
is allowed to evolve under influence of the gravitational perturbations of the
companion star. We find that the encounter velocities between planetesimals of
different size strongly depend on the gas disc eccentricity. In all cases
studied, inclusion of the full gas dynamics increases the encounter velocity
compared to the case of a static, circular gas disc. Full numerical parameter
exploration is still impossible, but we derive analytical formulae to estimate
encounter velocities between bodies of different sizes given the gas disc
eccentricity. The gas dynamical evolution of a protoplanetary disc in a binary

the shell model is an important issue when predicting changes in the shell
structure for exotic nuclei. In many cases pseudospin partner levels, that are
almost degenerate in energy for stable nuclei, are relevant in extracting the
size of the shell gaps. A breaking of the pseudospin symmetry can affect the
size of these gaps and change the magic numbers accordingly. The strength of
the pseudospin splitting is expected to depend in particular on
isovector-dependent and tensor contributions to the effective nuclear
interaction. A description employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics allows to
derive a pseudospin symmetry breaking potential that is regular in contrast to
the pseudospin-orbit potential in the conventional relativistic treatment. The
derived perturbation potential provides a measure to quantify the symmetry
breaking and it can be employed to improve mean-field calculations in order to
better reproduce the experimentally observed shell evolution. General
potentials with exact pseudospin symmetry are obtained that can be used in
relativistic mean-field Hamiltonians.

concentrated on odd denominator fractional values of $\nu$, the observation of
the even denominator $\nu=5/2$ state sparked a vast interest. This state is
conjectured to be characterized by quasiparticles of charge e/4, whose
statistics is non-abelian. In other words, interchanging of two quasi particles
may modify the state of the system to an orthogonal one, and does not just add
a phase as in for fermions or bosons. As such, these quasiparticles may be
useful for the construction of a topological quantum computer. Here we report
data of shot noise generated by partitioning edge currents in the $\nu=5/2$

inconsistent with other potentially possible values, such as e/2 and e. While
not proving the non-abelian nature of the $\nu=5/2$ state, this observation is

valuable model of the locking mechanism. The X(3872) is too narrow to be fitted

metallicity higher than a critical value ~10^{-6}-10^{-5}Z_sun are able to
fragment by dust cooling, thereby producing low-mass cores. Despite being above
the critical metallicity, a metallicity range is found to exist around
10^{-5}-10^{-4}Z_sun where low-mass fragmentation is prohibited. In this range,
three-body H_2 formation starts at low (~100K) temperature and thus the
resulting heating causes a dramatic temperature jump, which makes the central
part of the star-forming core transiently hydrostatic and thus highly
spherical. With little elongation, the core does not experience fragmentation
in the subsequent dust-cooling phase. The minimum fragmentation mass is set by
the Jeans mass just before the H_2 formation heating, and its value can be as
high as ~10M_sun. For metallicity higher than ~10^{-4}Z_sun, H_2 formation is
almost completed by the dust-surface reaction before the onset of the
three-body reaction, and low-mass star formation becomes possible. This
mechanism might explain the higher characteristic mass of metal-poor stars than
in the solar neighborhood presumed from the statistics of carbon-enhanced
stars.

contrast to several other flavor changing observables that are modified already
at tree level from a new Z' gauge boson, we have only one loop contributions in
this case. Nevertheless, these are interesting, as they may be enhanced and can
shed light on the charged gauge boson and Higgs sector of the model.
Numerically, we find that the Higgs sector, which is well approximated by a 2
Higgs doublet model (2HDM), dominates, since the gauge contributions are
already very strongly constrained. With respect to B -> X_s gamma, the signal
of the minimal 331 model is therefore nearly identical to the 2HDM one, which
allows us to obtain a lower bound on the charged Higgs mass. Further, we
observe, in analogy to the 2HDM model, that the branching fraction can be
rather strongly increased for small values of tan beta. Also, we find that B ->

ferromagnet (FM) with dipolar forces at $T_C\gg T\ge0$ using 1/S expansion. A
comprehensive analysis is carried out of the first 1/S corrections to the
spin-wave spectrum. In particular, similar to 3D FM discussed in our previous
paper A.V. Syromyatnikov, PRB {\bf 74}, 014435 (2006), we obtain that the
spin-wave interaction leads to the {\it gap} in the spectrum $\epsilon_{\bf k}$
renormalizing greatly the bare gapless spectrum at small momenta $k$.
Expressions for the spin-wave damping $\Gamma_{\bf k}$ are derived
self-consistently and it is concluded that magnons are well-defined
quasi-particles in both quantum and classical 2D FMs at small $T$. We observe
thermal enhancement of both $\Gamma_{\bf k}$ and $\Gamma_{\bf k}/\epsilon_{\bf
k}$ at small momenta. In particular, a peak appears in $\Gamma_{\bf k}$ and
$\Gamma_{\bf k}/\epsilon_{\bf k}$ at small $k$ and at any given direction of
$\bf k$. If $S\sim1$ the height of the peak in $\Gamma_{\bf k}/\epsilon_{\bf
k}$ is not larger than a value proportional to $T/D\ll1$, where $D$ is the
spin-wave stiffness. In the case of large spins $S\gg1$ the peak in
$\Gamma_{\bf k}/\epsilon_{\bf k}$ cannot be greater than that of the classical
2D FM found at $k=0$ which height is small only {\it numerically}: $\Gamma_{\bf
0}/\epsilon_{\bf 0}\approx0.16$ for the simple square lattice. Frustrating
next-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling increases $\Gamma_{\bf 0}/\epsilon_{\bf
0}$ in classical 2D FM only slightly. We find expressions for spin Green's
functions and the magnetization. The latter differs from the well-known result

clumpy multi-phase features in the ISM. Young stars are distributed in a thin
disk of which half-mass scale height is 10 - 30 pc. In low-nth models with nth

gas disk appears smoother than the high-nth models. A high-resolution
simulation with high-nth is necessary to reproduce the complex structure of the
gas disk. The global properties of the model galaxies in low-nth models, such
as star formation histories, are similar to those in the high-nth models when
we tune the value of C* so that they reproduce the observed relation between
surface gas density and surface star formation rate density. We however
emphasize that high-nth models automatically reproduce the relation, regardless
of the values of C*. The ISM structure, phase distribution, and distributions
of young star forming region are quite similar between two runs with values of
C* which differ by a factor of 15. We also found that the timescale of the flow
from n_H ~1 cm^{-3} to n_H > 100 cm^{-3} is about 5 times as long as the local
dynamical time and is independent of the value of C*. The use of a high-nth

whether there exist non-trivial bounded harmonic functions) attracted a lot of

still an open problem. We discuss examples of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds of
unbounded curvature where the limiting angle of Brownian motion degenerates to
a single point on the sphere at infinity, but where nevertheless the space of
bounded harmonic functions is as rich as in the non-degenerate case. To see the
full boundary the point at infinity has to be blown up in a non-trivial way.
Such examples indicate that the situation concerning the famous conjecture of

Cartan-Hadamard manifolds is much more complicated than one might have

$f(R)$-gravity with non-linear curvature terms $R^2$ and $R^3$ ($R$ being the
Ricci scalar curvature). It is different from $f(R)$-dark enrgy models, where
non-linear curvature terms are taken as gravitational alternative of dark
energy. In the present model, neither linear nor no-linear curvature terms are
taken as dark energy. Rather, dark energy terms are induced by curvature terms
in the Friedmann equation derived from $f(R)$-gravitational equations. It has
advantage over $f(R)$- dark energy models in the sense that the present model
satisfies WMAP results and expands as $\sim t^{2/3}$ during matter-dominance.
So, it does not have problems due to which $f(R)$-dark energy models are
criticized. Curvature-induced dark energy, obtained here, mimics phantom.
Different phases of this model, including acceleration and deceleration during
phantom phase, are investigated here.It is found that expansion of the universe
will stop at the age $(3.87 t_0 + 694.4 {\rm kyr})$ ($t_0$ being the present
age of the universe) and after this epoch, it will contract and collapse by the
time $(336.87 t_0 + 694.4 {\rm kyr})$. Further,it is shown that universe will
escape predicted collapse (obtained using classical mechanics) on making
quantum gravity corrections relevant near collapse time due to extremely high
energy density and large curvature analogous to the state of very early
universe. Interestingly, cosmological constant is also induced here, which is
very small in classical domain, but very high in quantum domain.

proliferation of trajectories of nearly identical classical action generates an
abundance of interference terms, which eventually leads to a suppression of
transport coefficients. We quantitatively describe this mechanism in two
different ways: the explicit description of transition probabilities in terms
of interfering trajectories, and an hierarchical integration over fluctuations

the galaxy distribution. First we employ a signal to noise analysis to find the
most appropriate properties of a survey in order to detect the correlated
signal at a level of more than 4 sigma: such a survey should cover more than
35% of the sky, the galaxy distribution should be probed with a median redshift
higher than 0.8, and the number of galaxies detected should be higher than a
few per squared arcmin. We consider the forthcoming surveys DUNE, LSST, SNAP,
PanSTARRS. We then compute the constraints that the DUNE survey can put on the
nature of dark energy (through different parametrizations of its equation of
state) with a standard Fisher matrix analysis. We confirm that, with respect to
pure CMB constraints, cross-correlation constraints help in breaking
degeneracies among the dark energy and the cosmological parameters. Naturally,
the constraining capability is not independent of the choice of the dark energy
model. Despite being weaker than some other probes (like Gravitational
Weak-Lensing), these constraints are complementary to them, being sensitive to
the high-redshift behaviour of the dark energy.

still present in the inner disk and the outer edge of the gap rises steeply --
features in better agreement with the underlying cause being gravitational
perturbation than a more gradual process such as grain growth. Importantly, the
good agreement of the spatially resolved data and spectrophometry-based model
lends confidence to current interpretations of SEDs with significant dust
emission deficits as arising from disks with inner gaps or holes. Further
SED-based searches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additional
candidates that can be examined at high spatial resolution.

$d$-dimensions is analyzed in the context of the Enskog kinetic equation. The
Enskog equation neglects velocity correlations but retains spatial correlations
arising from volume exclusion effects. As expected, there is a breakdown of the
Einstein relation $\epsilon=D/(T_0\mu)\neq 1$ relating diffusion $D$ and
mobility $\mu$, $T_0$ being the temperature of the impurity. The kinetic theory
results also show that the violation of the Einstein relation is only due to
the strong non-Maxwellian behavior of the reference state of the impurity
particles. The deviation of $\epsilon$ from unity becomes more significant as
the solid volume fraction and the inelasticity increase, especially when the
system is driven by the action of a Gaussian thermostat. This conclusion
qualitatively agrees with some recent simulations of dense gases [Puglisi {\em
et al.}, 2007 {\em J. Stat. Mech.} P08016], although the deviations observed in
computer simulations are more important than those obtained here from the
Enskog kinetic theory. Possible reasons for the quantitative discrepancies
between theory and simulations are discussed.

formed elsewhere, either in the Galactic disk or perhaps the Galactic center,
and subsequently ejected at high velocities to their current position. However,
some of these stars have apparent lifetimes shorter the required flight time
from the Galactic disk/center. We suggest that such stars have evolved in close
runaway or hypervelocity binaries. Stellar evolution of such binaries can drive
them into mass transfer configurations and even mergers. Such evolution could
then rejuvenate them (e.g. blue stragglers) and extend their lifetime after
their ejection. The extended lifetimes of such stars could then be reconciled
with their flight times to the Galactic halo. We study the possibilities of
binary runaway and hypervelocity stars and show that such binaries could have
been ejected in triple disruptions and other dynamical interactions with stars
or with massive black holes. We show that currently observed ""too young"" star
in the halo could have been ejected from the Galactic disk or the Galactic
center and be observable in their current position if they were ejected as
binaries. Specifically it is shown that the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439
could be such a rejuvenated star. Other suggestions for its ejection from the
LMC are found to be highly unlikely. Moreover, it is shown that its observed
metallicity is most consistent with a Galactic origin and a Galactic center
origin can not currently rule out. In addition, we suggest that triple
disruptions by the massive black hole in the Galactic center could also capture
binaries in close orbits near the MBH, some of which may later evolve to become
more massive rejuvenated stars.

characteristic scaling of the magnetoresistance amplitude versus the
field-temperature ratio. We propose a model which takes into account the
influence of paramagnetic impurities on the transport properties of the system
to describe these features. It is assumed that the non-colinearity between the
core spins inside the nanoparticles and the paramagnetic impurities can be
modelled by an effective tunnel barrier, the height of which depends on the
relative angle between the magnetization of both kind of spins. The influence
on the magnetotransport properties of the height and the thickness of the
effective tunnel barrier of the magnetic moment of the impurity, as well as the
bias voltage are studied. This model allows us to reproduce the large
magnetoresistance magnitude observed and its strong voltage dependence, with
realistic parameters.

calculating variance-based importance measures of the input variables, such as

known and widely used decision consists in replacing the computer code by a
metamodel, predicting the model responses with a negligible computation time
and rending straightforward the estimation of Sobol indices. In this paper, we
discuss about the Gaussian process model which gives analytical expressions of
Sobol indices. Two approaches are studied to compute the Sobol indices: the
first based on the predictor of the Gaussian process model and the second based
on the global stochastic process model. Comparisons between the two estimates,
made on analytical examples, show the superiority of the second approach in
terms of convergence and robustness. Moreover, the second approach allows to
integrate the modeling error of the Gaussian process model by directly giving
some confidence intervals on the Sobol indices. These techniques are finally
applied to a real case of hydrogeological modeling.

analysis techniques, based on the so-called Sobol indices, when some input
variables are functional, such as stochastic processes or random spatial
fields. In this work, we focus on large cpu time computer codes which need a
preliminary meta-modeling step before performing the sensitivity analysis. We
propose the use of the joint modeling approach, i.e., modeling simultaneously
the mean and the dispersion of the code outputs using two interlinked
Generalized Linear Models (GLM) or Generalized Additive Models (GAM). The
``mean'' model allows to estimate the sensitivity indices of each scalar input
variables, while the ``dispersion'' model allows to derive the total
sensitivity index of the functional input variables. The proposed approach is
compared to some classical SA methodologies on an analytical function. Lastly,
the proposed methodology is applied to a concrete industrial computer code that
simulates the nuclear fuel irradiation.

We present a new Ks-band survey that represents a significant extension
to the previous wide-field Ks-band imaging survey within the 0226-04 field of
the VIMOS-VLT deep survey (VVDS). The new data add ~ 458 arcmin^2 to the
previous imaging program, thus allowing us to cover a total contiguous area of
~ 600 arcmin^2 within this field. METHODS. Sources are identified both directly
on the final K-band mosaic image and on the corresponding, deep chi^2-g'r'i'
image from the CFHT Legacy Survey in order to reduce contamination while
ensuring us the compilation of a truly K-selected catalogue down to the
completeness limit of the Ks-band. The newly determined Ks-band magnitudes are
used in combination with the ancillary multiwavelength data for the
determination of accurate photometric redshifts. RESULTS. The final catalogue
totals ~ 52000 sources, out of which ~ 4400 have a spectroscopic redshift from
the VVDS first epoch survey. The catalogue is 90% complete down to K_Vega =
20.5 mag. We present K_s-band galaxy counts and angular correlation function
measurements down to such magnitude limit. Our results are in good agreement
with previously published work. We show that the use of K magnitudes in the
determination of photometric redshifts significantly lowers the incidence of
catastrophic errors. The data presented in this paper are publicly available
