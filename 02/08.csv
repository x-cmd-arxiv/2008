The mean extrinsic curvature is taken to be an arbitrary smooth function

arbitrarily far from constant. The rescaled background metric belongs to the
positive Yamabe class, and the freely specifiable part of the data given by the
traceless-transverse part of the rescaled extrinsic curvature and the matter
fields are taken to be sufficiently small, with the matter energy density not
identically zero. Using topological fixed-point arguments and global barrier
constructions, we then establish existence of solutions to the constraints. Two
recent advances in the analysis of the Einstein constraint equations make this
result possible: A new type of topological fixed-point argument without
smallness conditions on spatial derivatives of the mean extrinsic curvature,

that is similarly free of such conditions on the mean extrinsic curvature. For
clarity, we present our results only for strong solutions on closed manifolds.
However, our results also hold for weak solutions and for other cases such as
compact manifolds with boundary; these generalizations will appear elsewhere.
The existence results presented here for the Einstein constraints are
apparently the first such results that do not require smallness conditions on
spatial derivatives of the mean extrinsic curvature.

nitrogen and methane. The dense orange-brown smog hiding the satellite's
surface is produced by photochemical reactions of methane, nitrogen and their
dissociation products with solar ultraviolet, which lead primarily to the
formation of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons. In the years prior to the
exploration of Titan's surface by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, the
production and condensation of ethane was expected to have formed a
satellite-wide ocean one kilometer in depth, assuming that it was generated
over the Solar system's lifetime. However, Cassini-Huygens observations failed
to find any evidence of such an ocean. Here we describe the main cause of the
ethane deficiency on Titan: cryovolcanic lavas regularly cover its surface,
leading to the percolation of the liquid hydrocarbons through this porous
material and its accumulation in subsurface layers built up during successive
methane outgassing events. The liquid stored in the pores may, combined with
the ice layers, form a stable ethane-rich clathrate reservoir, potentially
isolated from the surface. Even with a low open porosity of 10% for the
subsurface layers, a cryovolcanic icy crust less than 2300 m thick is required
to bury all the liquid hydrocarbons generated over the Solar system's lifetime.

proved that some of these anomalies could be explained in the framework of a
modified concordance model, in which, there is an appropriate distribution of
vector perturbations with very large spatial scales. Vector modes are
associated with divergenceless (vortical) velocity fields. Here, the generation
of these modes is not studied in detail (it can be done ""a posteriori""); on the
contrary, we directly look for the distributions of these vector modes which
lead to both alignments of the second and third multipoles and a planar
octopole. A general three-dimensional (3D) superimposition of vector
perturbations does not produce any alignment, but we have found rather general
2D superimpositions leading to anomalies similar to the observed ones; in these
2D cases, the angular velocity has the same direction at any point of an
extended region and, moreover, this velocity has the same distribution in all
the planes orthogonal to it. Differential rotations can be seen as particular
cases, in which, the angular velocity only depends on the distance to a
rotation axis. Our results strongly suggest that appropriate mixtures of scalar
and vector modes with very large spatial scales could explain the observed CMB
anomalies.

Q_3=(0,\pi). Each broken symmetry state is characterized by the presence of

initial data of the truncated Einstein-Boltzmann hierarchy contemplate one
magnetized adiabatic mode and four (magnetized) non-adiabatic modes. After
obtaining the analytical form of the various solutions, the Einstein-Boltzmann

possible degeneracies between complementary sets of initial data might be

to decide whether to participate a game or not, the game being profitable when
there is an excess of players of the other type. We find the emergence of large
fluctuations as a result of the onset of a dynamical instability which may
arise discontinuously (increasing the discount factor) or continuously
(decreasing the experimentation rate). The phase diagram is characterized in
detail and noise amplification close to a bifurcation point is identified as
the physical mechanism behind the instability.

the locations of DNA melting bubbles using statistical mechanics models.
Computationally, this poses the challenge that a generic search through all
combinations of bubble starts and ends is quadratic.
  Results: An efficient algorithm is described, which shows that the time
complexity of the task is O(NlogN) rather than quadratic. The algorithm
exploits that bubble lengths may be limited, but without a prior assumption of
a maximal bubble length. No approximations, such as windowing, have been
introduced to reduce the time complexity. More than just finding the bubbles,
the algorithm produces a stitch profile, which is a probabilistic graphical
model of bubbles and helical regions. The algorithm applies a probability peak
finding method based on a hierarchical analysis of the energy barriers in the
Poland-Scheraga model.
  Conclusions: Exact and fast computation of genomic stitch profiles is thus
feasible. Sequences of several megabases have been computed, only limited by
computer memory. Possible applications are the genome-wide comparisons of
bubbles with promotors, TSS, viral integration sites, and other melting-related
regions.

the electroweak data, if all the Lee-Wick masses are of the same order, the

hold as with small PAHs.
  This does not hold for the other features. The larger PAH cations and anions
produce bands at 7.8 micron and, as PAH sizes increases, a band near 8.5 micron
becomes prominent and shifts slightly to the red. In addition, the average
anion peak falls slightly to the red of the average cation peak. The similarity
in behavior of the 7.8 and 8.6 micron bands with the astronomical observations
suggests that they arise from large, cationic and anionic PAHs, with the
specific peak position and profile reflecting the PAH cation to anion
concentration ratio and relative intensities of PAH size. Hence, the broad
astronomical 7.7 micron band is produced by a mixture of small and large PAH
cations and anions, with small and large PAHs contributing more to the 7.6 and
7.8 micron component respectively.

structures are altered in favor of more compact and symmetric forms. In
addition, the overlap between the duo and trio bands may reproduce the

masses likely emerges in a phase of rapid collapse and starburst at high
redshift, due to the balance of gravity on gas with the feedback force from
starbursts and the wind from the black hole; the average gravity on per unit
mass of gas is ~ 2 x 10^-10 m/sec^2 during the star burst phase. This level of
gravity could come from the real r^{-1} cusps of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos,
but the predicted gravity would have a large scatter due to dependence on
cosmological parameters and formation histories. Better agreement is found with
the gravity from the scalar field in some co-variant versions of MOND, which
can create the mirage of a Newtonian effective dark halo of density Pi r^{-1}
near the center, where the characteristic surface density Pi=130alpha^{-1} Msun
pc^{-2} and alpha is a fundamental constant of order unity fixed by the
Lagrangian of the co-variant theory if neglecting environmental effects.
  We show with a toy analytical model and a hydrodynamical simulation that a
constant background gravity due to MOND/TeVeS scalar field implies a critical
pressure synchronizing starbursts and the formation of galaxy bulges and
ellipticals. A universal threshold for the formation of the brightest regions
of galaxies in a MONDian universe suggests that the central BHs, bulges and
ellipticals would respect tight correlations like the M_{bulge}-M_{BH}-sigma
relations. In general MOND tends to produce tight correlations in galaxy
properties because its effective halo has less freedom and scatter than CDM

  Designated Verifier Signatures","23 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by
Steinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be
used as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional
functionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature
to any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message
was indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We
propose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our
first scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be
analyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery
assuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the
knowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the
Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle
model, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman
problem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained
computation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are
pairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user
setting proposed by Desmedt in 2003.

employed in order to obtain surfaces immersed in multidimensional Euclidean

the generalized Weierstrass formula for immersion describes conformally
parametrized surfaces in the su(N) algebra. In particular, for any holomorphic
or antiholomorphic solution of this model the associated surface can be
expressed in terms of an orthogonal projector of rank (N-1). The implementation
of this method is presented for two-dimensional conformally parametrized
surfaces immersed in the su(3) algebra. The usefulness of the proposed approach
is illustrated with examples, including the dilation-invariant meron-type
solutions and the Veronese solutions for the CP^2 model. Depending on the
location of the critical points (zeros and poles) of the first fundamental form
associated with the meron solution, it is shown that the associated surfaces
are semi-infinite cylinders. It is also demonstrated that surfaces related to

report a key step towards this goal. Starting from an ultracold dense gas of
heteronuclear 40K-87Rb Feshbach molecules with typical binding energies of a
few hundred kHz and a negligible dipole moment, we coherently transfer these
molecules into a vibrational level of the ground-state molecular potential
bound by >10 GHz. We thereby increase the binding energy and the expected
dipole moment of the 40K-87Rb molecules by more than four orders of magnitude
in a single transfer step. Starting with a single initial state prepared with
Feshbach association, we achieve a transfer efficiency of 84%. While dipolar
effects are not yet observable, the presented technique can be extended to
access much more deeply bound vibrational levels and ultimately those
exhibiting a significant dipole moment. The preparation of an ultracold quantum
gas of polar molecules might therefore come within experimental reach.

this inconvenience consists in replacing the complex computer code by a reduced
model, called a metamodel, or a response surface that represents the computer
code and requires acceptable calculation time. One particular class of
metamodels is studied: the Gaussian process model that is characterized by its
mean and covariance functions. A specific estimation procedure is developed to
adjust a Gaussian process model in complex cases (non linear relations, highly
dispersed or discontinuous output, high dimensional input, inadequate sampling
designs, ...). The efficiency of this algorithm is compared to the efficiency
of other existing algorithms on an analytical test case. The proposed

named proxy re-signatures where a proxy turns a signature computed under
Alice's secret key into one from Bob on the same message. The semi-trusted
proxy does not learn either party's signing key and cannot sign arbitrary
messages on behalf of Alice or Bob. At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger
revisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and
efficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open
the problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is
able to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated
several times.
  This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago,
and shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We
describe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the
Ateniese-Hohenberger model. The same technique also yields a similar
construction in the standard model (i.e. without relying on random oracles).
Both schemes are efficient and require newly defined -- but falsifiable --

gas giant planet formation, the retention of dust grains in the presence of gas
drag and that of cores despite type I migration. The efficiency of these
processes is determined by the disk structure. Theoretical models suggest that
planets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral ``dead
zone'' near the mid plane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surface
layers where magnetorotational instability is active. Due to a transition in
the abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptly
near the ice line. Over a range of modest accretion rates ($\sim
10^{-9}-10^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), the change in the angular momentum
transfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maxima
near the ice line. The azimuthal velocity becomes super-Keplerian and the
grains accumulate in this transition zone. This barrier locally retains
protoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy element surface density to the
critical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. It leads to a
preferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. We simulate and reproduce
the observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solar
type stars without having to greatly reduce the type I migration strength. The
mass function of the short-period planets can be utilized to calibrate the
efficiency of type I migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars with
habitable terrestrial planets.

satellite from its own observational data is studied. It is well known that
data processing of microarcsecond-level astrometric observations imposes very
stringent requirements on the accuracy of the orbital velocity of the satellite
(a velocity correction of 1.45 mm/s implies an aberrational correction of 1
$\mu$as). Because of a number of degeneracies the orbital velocity cannot be
fully restored from observations provided by the satellite. Seven constraints
that must be applied on a velocity parameterization are discussed and
formulated mathematically. It is shown what part of velocity can be recovered
from astrometric data by a combined fit of both velocity parameters and
astrometric parameters of the sources. Numerical simulations show that, with
the seven constraints applied, the velocity and astrometric parameters can be
reliably estimated from observational data. It is also argued that the idea to
improve the velocity of an astrometric satellite from its own observational
data is only useful if the a priori information on the orbital velocity
justifies the applicability of the velocity constraints. The proposed model
takes into account only translational motion of the satellite and ignores any
satellite-specific parameters. Therefore, the results of this study are equally
applicable to both scanning missions similar to Gaia, and pointing ones like
SIM, provided that enough sources were observed sufficiently uniformly.

stellar wind and a mildly relativistic hydrodynamical jet of supersonic
nature.}{We have performed numerical 2-dimensional simulations of jets, with
cylindrical and planar (slab) symmetry, crossing the stellar wind material.
  From the results of the simulations, we derive estimates of the particle
acceleration efficiency, using first order Fermi acceleration theory, and give
some insight on the possible radiative outcomes. We find that, during jet
launching, the jet head generates a strong shock in the wind. During and after
this process, strong recollimation shocks can occur due to the initial
overpressure of the jet with its environment. The conditions in all these
shocks are convenient to accelerate particles up to $\sim$ TeV energies, which
can lead to leptonic (synchrotron and inverse Compton) and hadronic
(proton-proton) radiation. In principle, the cylindrical jet simulations show
that the jet is stable, and can escape from the system even for relatively low
power. However, when accounting for the wind ram pressure, the jet can be bent
and disrupted for power $\la 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

This analysis was based on a study of the tails of the distribution. We now
check the entire distribution, in particular its central part. This is
important in view of a recent q-generalization of the Central Limit Theorem,
which states that for certain classes of strongly correlated random variables
the rescaled sum approaches a q-Gaussian limit distribution. We numerically
investigate for the logistic map with a parameter in a small vicinity of the

in the central region and in the tail region, and find a scaling law involving
the Feigenbaum constant delta. Our results are consistent with a large number

The original and unifying systematization of the crossovers between the

in terms of quantum to classical, weak coupling to strong coupling, adiabatic
to nonadiabatic, itinerant to self-trapped polarons and large to small

of large adiabatic polarons, the regime of small adiabatic polarons, the regime
of small nonadiabatic (Lang-Firsov) polarons, and the transitory regime of
small pinned polarons for which the adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions
are inextricably mixed in the polaron dispersion properties. The crossovers
between these five regimes are positioned in the parameter space of the

from which projected trajectories are used to determine the effective
interactions in the united atoms model. The simulation results support our
argument that the thermostat should be viewed as an integral part of the

equilibrium. As our main result we show that the united atoms model with the
adjusted effective interactions approximately reproduce the diffusion constant
and the viscosity of the underlying detailed SPC water model.

transfer fluxes at the walls increase by roughly 2% when the flow is laden with
the smaller particles, which exhibit a rather persistent stability against
non-homogeneous distribution and near-wall concentration. An opposite trend
(slight heat transfer flux decrease) is observed when the larger particles are
dispersed into the flow. These results are consistent with previous
experimental findings and are discussed in the frame of the current research
activities in the field. Future developments are also outlined.

clusters of galaxies and determine the Fe distribution in the intracluster
medium relative to the stellar distribution in the central dominant galaxy
(CDG). Our analysis shows that the Fe is significantly more extended than the
stellar mass in the CDG in all of the clusters in our sample, with a slight
trend of increasing extent with increasing central cooling time. The excess Fe
within the central 100 kpc in these clusters can be produced by Type Ia
supernovae from the CDG over the past 3-7 Gyr. Since the excess Fe primarily
originates from the CDG, it is a useful probe for determining the motion of the
gas and the mechanical energy deposited by AGN outbursts over the past $\sim$ 5
Gyr in the centers of clusters. We explore two possible mechanisms for
producing the greater extent of the Fe relative to the stars in the CDG,
including: bulk expansion of the gas and turbulent diffusion of Fe. Assuming
the gas and Fe expand together, we find that a total energy of $10^{60} -
10^{61}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ must have been deposited into the central 100 kpc of
these clusters to produce the presently observed Fe distributions. Since the
required enrichment time for the excess Fe is approximately 5 Gyr in these
clusters, this gives an average AGN mechanical power over this time of $10^{43}
- 10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. The extended Fe distribution in cluster cores can also
arise from turbulent diffusion. Assuming steady-state (i.e., the outward mass
flux of Fe across a given surface is equal to the mass injection rate of Fe
within that surface) we find that diffusion coefficients of $10^{29} - 10^{30}$
cm$^2$~s$^{-1}$ are required to maintain the presently observed Fe profiles
