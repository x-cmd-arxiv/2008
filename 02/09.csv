or gravity (Extended Quintessence) has recently attracted a deep interest and
has been widely investigated both in the Einstein and in the Jordan frames (EF,
JF), within scalar tensor theories. Focusing on the simplest models proposed so
far, in this paper we study the relation existing between the two scenarios,
isolating the Weyl scaling which allows to express them in the EF and JF.
Moreover, we perform a comparative study of the behavior of linear
perturbations in both scenarios, which turn out to behave in a markedly
different way. In particular, while the clustering is enhanced in the
considered CQ models with respect to the corresponding Quintessence ones where
the coupling is absent and to the ordinary cosmologies with a Cosmological
Constant and Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), structures in EQ models may grow slower.
This is likely to have direct consequences on the inner properties of
non-linear structures, like cluster concentration, as well as on the weak
lensing shear on large scales. Finally, we specialize our study for interfacing
linear dynamics and N-body simulations in these cosmologies, giving a recipe
for the corrections to be included in N-body codes in order to take into
account the modifications to the expansion rate, growth of structures, and
strength of gravity.

low-spin and high-spin states at thermally accessible energies, are ubiquitous

collective properties for the case of non-magnetic low-spin ions, which applies
to Fe(II) compounds. Monte Carlo simulations are used to study a
three-dimensional spin-crossover model for the full parameter range from
essentially pure high spin to essentially pure low spin. We find that as the
low-spin state becomes more favorable, the Curie temperature drops, the
universality class deviates from the three-dimensional Heisenberg class, and
the transition eventually changes to first order. A heat-bath algorithm that
grows or shrinks low-spin and high-spin domains is developed to handle the
first-order transition. When the ground state has low spin, a reentrant
magnetic transition is found in a broad parameter range. We also observe a
percolation transition of the high spins, which branches off the first-order
magnetic transition.

typical for radiatively-driven winds. The clumpiness cause the two winds to
mix. The relativistic electrons from the pulsar wind are retained in the moving
clumps by inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, which explains the X-ray
variability observed on time scales much shorter than the orbital period. We
calculate detailed inhomogeneous spectral models reproducing the average
broad-band spectrum from radio to TeVs. Given the uncertainties the form of the
distribution of relativistic electrons, the X-ray spectrum could be dominated
by either Compton or synchrotron emission. The recent Fermi observations
constrain the high-energy cut-off in the electron distribution to be at the
Lorentz factor of 2 10^4 or 10^8 in the former and latter model, respectively.
We provide formulae comparing the losses of the relativistic electrons due to
Compton, synchrotron and Coulomb processes vs. the distance from the Be star.
We calculate the optical depth of the wind to free-free absorption, showing
that it will suppress most of the radio emission within the orbit. We point out
the importance of Compton and Coulomb heating of the stellar wind within and

yields global errors ~1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional
techniques. The strongest differences are seen for problems in which a shear
field is superposed. For smooth flows, Glimm's method is inferior to standard
methods. The location of specific features can be off by up to two grid points
with respect to an exact solution in Glimm's method, and furthermore curved
states are not modeled optimally since the method idealizes solutions as being
composed of piecewise constant states. Thus although Glimm's method is superior
at correctly resolving sharp features, especially in the presence of shear, for
realistic applications in which one typically finds smooth flows plus strong
gradients or discontinuities, standard FD methods yield smaller global errors.
Glimm's method may prove useful in certain applications such as GRB afterglow

pileup or underlying event (UE), that on average, in the jet's neighbourhood,
is uniform in rapidity and azimuth. In this article we establish a theoretical
grounding for the discussion of jet areas, introducing two main definitions,
passive and active areas, which respectively characterise the sensitivity to
pointlike or diffuse pileup and UE radiation. We investigate the properties of
jet areas for three standard jet algorithms, k_t, Cambridge/Aachen and SISCone.
Passive areas for single-particle jets are equal to the naive geometrical
expectation \pi R^2, but acquire an anomalous dimension at higher orders in the
coupling, calculated here at leading order. The more physically relevant active
areas differ from \pi R^2 even for single-particle jets, substantially so in
the case of the cone algorithms like SISCone with a Tevatron Run-II
split--merge procedure. We compare our results with direct measures of areas in
parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and find good agreement with the main
features of the analytical predictions. We furthermore justify the use of jet
areas to subtract the contamination from pileup.

$\Lambda$ hypernuclei and ordinary nuclei. We argue that there are three major
contributions to the spin-orbit interaction: 1) a short-range component
involving scalar and vector mean fields; 2) a ''wrong-sign'' spin-orbit term
generated by the pion exchange tensor force in second order; and 3) a
three-body term induced by two-pion exchange with excitation of virtual
$\Delta(1232)$-isobars (a la Fujita-Miyazawa). For nucleons in nuclei the
long-range pieces related to the pion-exchange dynamics tend to cancel, leaving
room dominantly for spin-orbit mechanisms of short-range origin (parametrized
e.g. in terms of relativistic scalar and vector mean fields terms). In
contrast, the absence of an analogous $2\pi$-exchange three-body contribution
for $\Lambda$ hyperons in hypernuclei leads to an almost complete cancellation
between the short-range (relativistic mean-field) component and the
''wrong-sign'' spin-orbit interaction generated by second order $\pi$-exchange
with an intermediate $\Sigma$ hyperon. These different balancing mechanisms
between short- and long-range components are able to explain simultaneously the
very strong spin-orbit interaction in ordinary nuclei and the remarkably weak

the frequency and coupling strength associated with microscopic reservoir modes

atom-cavity system inside an oscillating external bath. We show that it is
possible to dynamically decouple the atom from its environment, despite the
fact that the two remain resonant at all times. This can lead to Markovian
dynamics, even for a strong atom-bath coupling, as the atomic decay becomes
inhibited into all but a few channels; the reservoir occupation spectrum
consequently acquires a sideband structure, with peaks separated by the
frequency of the environmental modulation. The reduction in the rate of
spontaneous emission using this approach can be significantly greater than
could be achieved with an oscillatory atom-bath detuning using the same
parameters.

We calibrate the number density, completeness, reliability and the

  Methods. We simulate maps of the thermal SZ effect and the X-ray emission
from light cones constructed in a large, hydrodynamical, cosmological
simulation volume, including realistic noise contributions. The maps are
convolved with linear, optimised, single- and multi-band filters to identify
local peaks and their signal-to-noise ratios. The resulting peak catalogues are
then compared to the halo population in the simulation volume to identify true
and spurious detections.
  Results. Multi-band filtering improves the statistics of SZ cluster
detections considerably compared to single-band filtering. Observations with
the characteristics of ACT detect clusters with masses M>6-9e13 M_o/h, quite
independent of redshift, reach 50% completeness at ~1e14 M_o/h and 100%
completeness at ~2e14 M_o/h. Samples are contaminated by only a few per cent
spurious detections. This is broadly comparable to X-ray cluster detections
with XMM-Newton with 100 ks exposure time in the soft band, except that the
mass limit for X-ray detections increases much more steeply with redshift than
for SZ detections. A comparison of true and filtered signals in the SZ and
X-ray maps confirms that the filters introduce at most a negligible bias.

small, the standard procedure would imply the inclusion of fractional numbers

bright compact central source with a jet-like extension, and a fan-like spray
of high-velocity (with radial velocities upto 350 kms/s) elongated knots which
appear to emanate from it. These structures are possibly analogous to the
near-IR ""bullets"" seen in the Orion nebula. Interferometric observations at 2.6
mm show the presence of a high-velocity CO outflow and a continuum source also
with a faint extension, both of which are aligned with the optical jet
structure. IRAS 05506 is most likely not a PPN. We find extended NH3 (1,1)
emission towards IRAS 05506; these data together with the combined presence of
far-IR emission, H2O and OH masers, and CO and CS J=2-1 emission, strongly
argue for a dense, dusty star-forming core associated with IRAS 05506. IRAS
05506 is probably an intermediate-mass or massive protostar, and the very short
time-scale (200 yr) of its outflows indicates that it is very young. If IRAS
05506 is a massive star, then the lack of radio continuum and the late G --
early K spectral type we find from our optical spectra implies that in this

the soft breaking parameters in SUSY models; however, implementing them leads
to the several undesirable features including: tachyonic sleptons and
electroweak symmetry breaking problems in both the MSSM and the NMSSM. Since
these two theories also have the additonal problem of massless neutrinos, we
have reconsidered the AMSB problems in a class of models that extends the NMSSM
to explain small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. In a recent paper,
we showed that for a class of minimal left-right extensions, a built-in
mechanism exists which naturally solves the tachyonic slepton problem and
provides new alternatives to the MSSM that also have automatic R-parity
conservation. In this paper, we discuss how electroweak symmetry breaking
arises in this model through an NMSSM-like low energy theory with a singlet
VEV, induced by the structure of the left-right extension and of the right
magnitude. We then study the phenomenological issues and find: the LSP is an
Higgsino-wino mix, new phenomenology for chargino decays to the LSP, degenerate
same generation sleptons and a potential for a mild squark-slepton degeneracy.
We also discuss possible collider signatures and the feasibility of dark matter
in this model.

steady-state induction behavior in the absence of external glucose. Numerical
analysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two
natural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer
concentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these
bistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems
that are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for
induction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The
model predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or
permease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially
relevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model
regulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a
metabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is
the inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations
yield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with
an unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small
amounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results
cast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural
context of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing
theoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an
experimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon

principal motivation is in connecting quantum registers without resorting to
optics. A spin chain is a permanently coupled 1D system of spins. When one
places a quantum state on one end of it, the state will be dynamically
transmitted to the other end with some efficiency if the spins are coupled by
an exchange interaction. No external modulations or measurements on the body of
the chain, except perhaps at the very ends, is required for this purpose. For
the simplest (uniformly coupled) chain and the simplest encoding (single qubit
encoding), however, dispersion reduces the quality of transfer. We present a
variety of alternatives proposed by various groups to achieve perfect quantum
state transfer through spin chains. We conclude with a brief discussion of the
various directions in which the topic is developing.

stabilize the vacua of these theories at a center-symmetric point, we suggest
to perform a double trace deformation. With these deformation, the theories at
hand are at weak coupling at small $r(S_1)$ and yet exhibit basic features of
the large-$r(S_1)$ limit: confinement and $\chi$SB. We calculate the string
tension, mass gap, bifermion condensates and $\theta$ dependence. The

Despite the fact that at small $r(S_1)$ confinement is Abelian, while it is
expected to be non-Abelian at large $r(S_1)$, we argue that small and

seen by two relatively accelerated observers has been investigated. It is found
that the same initial entanglement for an initial state parameter $\alpha$ and
its ""normalized partner"" $\sqrt{1-\alpha^{2}}$ will be degraded by the Unruh
effect along two different trajectories except for the maximally entangled
state, which just shows the inequivalence of the quantization for a free field
in the Minkowski and Rindler coordinates. In the infinite acceleration limit
the state doesn't have the distillable entanglement for any $\alpha$ for the
scalar field but always remains entangled to a degree which is dependent of
$\alpha$ for the Dirac field. It is also interesting to note that in this limit
the mutual information equals to just half of the initially mutual information,
which is independent of $\alpha$ and the type of field.

find q ~ 0.1 for 87Rb atomic gas, q ~ 0.95 for 7Li and q ~ 0.62 for 23Na. It is
concluded that the effective interactions are essentially attractive for the

fluctuations in the YBa2Cu3O6.35 superconductor (Tc=18 K). The long-range
ordered collinear spins of the insulating antiferromagnet are replaced by a
commensurate central mode arising from slow, isotropically polarized,
short-range spin correlations. The inelastic spectrum up to 30 meV is broad in
wave vector and commensurate. In contrast to the the resonance peak of higher
Tc superconductors, the spins exhibit a single overdamped spectrum whose rate
of relaxation decreases on cooling and saturates at 5 meV below 50 K. As the
relaxation rate saturates the quasi-static spin correlations grow and become
resolution limited in energy. The spin susceptibility at high temperatures
illustrates that the dominant energy scale is set by the temperature. At low
temperatures, the scale length is geometric and not linked by velocity to
dynamic widths. There is no observable suppression of the spin fluctuations or
central mode upon the onset of superconductivity. The spins respond not to
coherent charge pairs but to hole doping allowing coexistence of glassy short
range spin order with superconductivity. Since the physics of the weakly
superconducting system YBCO6.35 must connect continuously with that in more
strongly superconducting YBCO6.5, we find that neither incommensurate
stripe-like spin modulations nor a well-defined neutron spin resonance are
essential for the onset with doping of pairing in a high temperature cuprate
superconductor.

energy cosmic rays. It is unique in its reliance on charged particles as the
information carriers. While no discrete source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
has been identified so far, a new generation of detectors is acquiring the huge
exposure that is needed at the highest energies, where deflection by magnetic
fields is minimized and the background from distant sources is eliminated by
pion photoproduction. In this paper, we summarize the status of cosmic ray
astronomy, describing the detectors and the analysis techniques.

two Finsler manifolds $(M, F)$ and $(N,\tilde F)$ and we give some geometrical
properties of these affine maps. Starting from the equations of the affine
maps, we construct a natural Berwald-Riemann-Lagrange geometry on the 1-jet
space $J^1(TM;N)$, in the sense of a Berwald nonlinear connection
$\Gamma^b_jet$, a Berwald $\Gamma^b_jet$-linear d-connection $B\Gamma^b_jet$,
together with its d-torsions and d-curvatures, which geometrically
characterizes the initial affine maps between Finsler manifolds.

neglected in earlier studies, has also been taken into account.

Letter, we present a multiwavelength study of this galaxy (combining radio,
2MASS, optical and ultraviolet data). The ring of UGC 7069, whose diameter
measures ~115 kpc, is also warped at its edges. The nucleus appears
double-peaked and hosts a possible LINER. The ultraviolet data indicate a
strong blue colour and suggest that UGC 7069 is a starburst galaxy. We also
present N-body simulation results, which indicate that galaxy collisions can
produce such huge rings. Large inclination angles between the target and the
intruder galaxy may account for the formation of warped rings. Multiwavelength
observations are highly essential to constrain our simulation results, which
will address the formation and evolution of such a rare galaxy.

Projection Chamber (TPC) are presented. The TPC was built and installed at the
CERES/NA45 experiment at the CERN SPS in the late nineties, with the objective
to improve the momentum resolution of the spectrometer. The upgraded experiment
took data twice, in 1999 and in 2000. After a detailed study of residual
distortions a spatial resolution of 340 um in the azimuthal and 640 um in the
radial direction was achieved, corresponding to a momentum resolution of Dp/p =
sqrt{(1% * p/GeV)^2 + (2%)^2}.
