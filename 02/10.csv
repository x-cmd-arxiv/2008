scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum when parameterized either by
a power law or by a spectral index with non-zero ""running"". This deviation, by
itself, serves as a powerful tool to discriminate among theories for the origin
of cosmological structures such as inflationary models. Here, we use a
minimally-parametric smoothing spline technique to reconstruct the shape of the
primordial power spectrum. This technique is well-suited to search for smooth
features in the primordial power spectrum such as deviations from scale
invariance or a running spectral index, although it would recover sharp
features of high statistical significance. We use the WMAP 3 year results in
combination with data from a suite of higher resolution CMB experiments
(including the latest ACBAR 2008 release), as well as large-scale structure
data from SDSS and 2dFGRS. We employ cross-validation to assess, using the data
themselves, the optimal amount of smoothness in the primordial power spectrum
consistent with the data. This minimally-parametric reconstruction supports the
evidence for a power law primordial power spectrum with a red tilt, but not for
deviations from a power law power spectrum. Smooth variations in the primordial
power spectrum are not significantly degenerate with the other cosmological
parameters.

mixture of $k$ product distributions over a Boolean cube $\{0, 1\}^K$ according
to their distributions. Each distribution is described by a vector of allele
frequencies in $\R^K$. Given two distributions, we use $\gamma$ to denote the
average $\ell_2^2$ distance in frequencies across $K$ dimensions, which
measures the statistical divergence between them. We study the case assuming
that bits are independently distributed across $K$ dimensions. This work
demonstrates that, for a balanced input instance for $k = 2$, a certain
graph-based optimization function returns the correct partition with high
probability, where a weighted graph $G$ is formed over $n$ individuals, whose
pairwise hamming distances between their corresponding bit vectors define the
edge weights, so long as $K = \Omega(\ln n/\gamma)$ and $Kn = \tilde\Omega(\ln
n/\gamma^2)$. The function computes a maximum-weight balanced cut of $G$, where
the weight of a cut is the sum of the weights across all edges in the cut. This
result demonstrates a nice property in the high-dimensional feature space: one
can trade off the number of features that are required with the size of the
sample to accomplish certain tasks like clustering.

from black hole X-ray binaries in low/hard and intermediate spectral states is
a broad band-limited noise, characterized by a constant below some frequency (a
``break'' frequency) and a power law above this frequency. It has been shown
that the variability of this type can be produced by the inward diffusion of
the local driving perturbations in a bounded configuration (accretion disk or
corona). In the framework of this model, the perturbation diffusion time t_0 is
related to the phenomenological break frequency, while the PDS power-law slope
above the ``break'' is determined by the viscosity distribution over the
configuration. he perturbation diffusion scenario explains the decay of the
power of X-ray variability observed in a number of compact sources (containing
black hole and neutron star) during an evolution of theses sources from
low/hard to high/soft states. We compare the model predictions with the subset
of data from Cyg X-1 collected by the Rossi X-ray Time Explorer (RXTE). Our
extensive analysis of the Cyg X-1 PDSs demonstrates that the observed
integrated power P_x decreases approximately as a square root of the
characteristic frequency of the driving oscillations \nu_{dr}. The RXTE
observations of Cyg X-1 allow us to infer P_{dr} and t_0 as a function of
\nu_{dr}. Using the inferred dependences of the integrated power of the driving
oscillations P_{dr} and t_0 on \nu_{dr} we demonstrate that the power predicted

similar to the observed P_{x} behavior.

exhibits bistability. Most models in the literature assume that the inducer
enters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like
process. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However,
analysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is
comparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7
times the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady
states corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of
these fluxes can be ignored. Here, we formulate a model accounting for both
fluxes. We show that: (a) The thresholds of bistability are profoundly affected
by both fluxes. The diffusive influx reduces the on threshold by enhancing
inducer accumulation in non-induced cells. The carrier efflux increases the off
threshold by decreasing inducer accumulation in induced cells. (b) Simulations
of the model with experimentally measured parameter values are in good
agreement with the data for IPTG. However, there are discrepancies with respect
to the data for TMG. They are most likely due to two features missing from the
model, namely, the variation of the inducer exclusion effect and the specific
growth rate with the lactose enzyme levels. (c) The steady states and
thresholds obtained in the presence of both fluxes are well approximated by
simple analytical expressions, which may be useful for the preliminary design

region of central collapse in a numerical simulation of the formation,
evolution, and subsequent collapse of a dense cloud out of a transonic
compression in the diffuse atomic ISM. The clumps have sizes $\sim 1$ pc,
masses of several hundred $M_\odot$, and three-dimensional velocity dispersions
$\sim 3$ km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with typical observed values for such
structures. The clumps break down into massive cores of sizes $\sim 0.1$ pc,
densities $\sim 10^5$, masses 2-300 $M_\odot$, with distributions of these
quantities that peak at the same values as the massive core sample in a recent
survey of the Cygnus X molecular cloud complex. Although preliminary, these
results suggest that high-mass star forming clumps may be in a state of global
gravitational collapse rather than in equilibrium supported by strong
turbulence.

phenomena in quantum systems, where classical probability theory does not
apply, because the lattice of measurable sets is not necessarily distributive.
On the other hand, it is well known that the lattices of concepts, that arise
in data analysis, are in general also non-distributive, albeit for completely
different reasons. In his recent book, van Rijsbergen argues that many of the
logical tools developed for quantum systems are also suitable for applications
in information retrieval. I explore the mathematical support for this idea on
an abstract vector space model, covering several forms of data analysis
(information retrieval, data mining, collaborative filtering, formal concept
analysis...), and roughly based on an idea from categorical quantum mechanics.
It turns out that quantum (i.e., noncommutative) probability distributions
arise already in this rudimentary mathematical framework. We show that a
Bell-type inequality must be satisfied by the standard similarity measures, if
they are used for preference predictions. The fact that already a very general,
abstract version of the vector space model yields simple counterexamples for
such inequalities seems to be an indicator of a genuine need for quantum
statistics in data analysis.

falls off with distance r as 1/r^3. Comparison is made with the properties of
the corresponding short-range models studied earlier. Seismic spatiotemporal
correlations of the long-range models generally tend to be weaker than those of
the short-range models. The magnitude distribution exhibits a ``near-critical''
behavior, i.e., a power-law-like behavior close to the Gutenberg-Richter law,
for a wide parameter range with its B-value, B\simeq 0.55, insensitive to the
model parameters, in sharp contrast to that of the 2D short-range model and
those of the 1D short-range and long-range models where such a
``near-critical'' behavior is realized only by fine-tuning the model
parameters. In contrast to the short-range case, the mean stress-drop at a
seismic event of the long-range model is nearly independent of its magnitude,
consistently with the observation. Large events often accompany foreshocks
together with a doughnut-like quiescence as their precursors, while they hardly

lying in an arbitrary high dimensional space can be accurately recovered from
only a small set of non-adaptive linear measurements. Under appropriate
conditions on the measurement matrix, the entire information about the original
sparse vector is captured in the measurements, and can be recovered using
efficient polynomial methods. The vector model has been extended to a finite
set of sparse vectors sharing a common non-zero location set. In this paper, we
treat a broader framework in which the goal is to recover a possibly infinite
set of jointly sparse vectors. Extending existing recovery methods to this
model is difficult due to the infinite structure of the sparse vector set.
Instead, we prove that the entire infinite set of sparse vectors can recovered
by solving a single, reduced-size finite-dimensional problem, corresponding to
recovery of a finite set of sparse vectors. We then show that the problem can
be further reduced to the basic recovery of a single sparse vector by randomly
combining the measurement vectors. Our approach results in exact recovery of
both countable and uncountable sets as it does not rely on discretization or
heuristic techniques. To efficiently recover the single sparse vector produced
by the last reduction step, we suggest an empirical boosting strategy that
improves the recovery ability of any given sub-optimal method for recovering a
sparse vector. Numerical experiments on random data demonstrate that when
applied to infinite sets our strategy outperforms discretization techniques in
terms of both run time and empirical recovery rate. In the finite model, our
boosting algorithm is characterized by fast run time and superior recovery rate
than known popular methods.

systems by means of quantum Monte Carlo. The evaluation of the
(Born-Oppenheimer) forces acting on the ionic positions is achieved by two main
ingredients: i) the forces are computed with finite and small variance, which
allows the simulation of a large number of atoms, ii) the statistical noise
corresponding to the forces is used to drive the dynamics at finite temperature
by means of an appropriate Langevin dynamics. A first application to the
high-density phase of Hydrogen is given, supporting the stability of the liquid
phase at \simeq 300GPa and \simeq 400K.

non-stopping times contain very useful information. As a consequence, we obtain
the law of the maximum of a continuous nonnegative local martingale $(M_t)$

$\psi$ as well as the law of the last time this maximum is reached.

estimators. The first and larger class is restricted to the set of all
permutation invariant estimators. The second class is restricted further to
simple symmetric procedures. That is, estimators such that each parameter is
estimated by a function of the corresponding observation alone. We show that
under mild conditions, the minimal total squared error risks over these two

  histograms in Fig. 5",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078896",,"astro-ph",,"  [Abridged] We describe the near-infrared reddening signature of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) in external galaxies. In particular, we examine the
E(J-H) and E(H-K) color-excesses, and the effective extinction law observed in
discrete GMC regions. We also study the effect of the relative scale height of
the GMC distribution to the color-excesses, and to the observed mass function
of GMCs. We perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with 3D models
of stellar radiation and clumpy dust distributions, resembling a face-on
geometry. The scattered light is included in the models, and near-infrared
color maps are calculated from the simulated data. The effective near-infrared
reddening law, i.e. the ratio E(J-H)/E(H-K), has a value close to unity in GMC
regions. The ratio depends on the relative scale height of GMCs, xi, and for xi
values 0.1...0.75 we find the typical ratios of 0.6...1.1. The effective
extinction law turns out to be very flat in GMC regions. We find the ratios of
apparent extinctions of A(H)/A(K)=1.35...1.55 and A(J)/A(H)=1.15. The effect of
the scattered flux on the effective reddening law, as well as on the effective
extinction law, is significant. Regarding the GMC mass function, we find no
correlation between the input and observed slopes of the mass functions.
Rather, the observed slope reflects the parameter $\xi$ and the dynamical range
of the mass function. We estimate that only a fraction of 10...20 % of the
total mass of GMCs is recovered, if the observed color-excess values are
transformed to masses using the Galactic reddening law. In the case of
individual clouds the fraction can vary between ~0...50 %.

loops is investigated. Analytical dispersion relations and mode profiles are
derived for the second-order ordinary differential equation governing the z-
component of the perturbation in the magnetic field, $\delta B_z$. All other
components are given in terms of $\delta B_z$. Deviations from the frequencies
and mode profiles of homogenous loops are given as functions of the density
scale height. The effects of the fixed and variable column masses, negative
scale heights, and density contrasts inside and outside of the loops are
studied. The frequency ratios, mode profiles, and the antinode shifts from
those of the sine profiles of the homogenous loops, are tools to estimate solar
photospheric parameters. To this end, we have expanded the relevant factors up
to the second order in the stratification parameter. In particular, we verify
that the first overtone antinode shifts are in the Mm range and are within the
reach of the resolutions of the present day observations.

associated with phase transitions. However, such interpretations are
complicated by a lack of stability and, more significantly, by a lack of
conclusive insight from microscopic models. Here, I focus on the later problem.
I use the thermodynamic Riemannian curvature scalar $R$ as a try to get
microscopic information from the known thermodynamics. The hope is that this
could facilitate matching black hole thermodynamics to known models of
statistical mechanics. For the Kerr-Newman black hole, the sign of $R$ is
mostly positive, in contrast to that for ordinary thermodynamic models, where
$R$ is mostly negative. Cases with negative $R$ include most of the simple
critical point models. An exception is the Fermi gas, which has positive $R$. I
demonstrate several exact correspondences between the two-dimensional Fermi gas
and the extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. $R$ diverges to $+\infty$ along curves
of diverging heat capacities $C_{J,\Phi}$ and $C_{\Omega,Q}$, but not along the
Davies curve of diverging $C_{J,Q}$. Finding statistical mechanical models with
like behavior might yield additional insight into the microscopic properties of
black holes. I also discuss a possible physical interpretation of $|R|$.

channels using low-density parity-check codes and message-passing decoding. The
asymptotic (in the length) performance of such a combination for a fixed number
of iterations is given by density evolution. Letting the number of iterations
tend to infinity we get the density evolution threshold, the largest channel
parameter so that the bit error probability tends to zero as a function of the
iterations.
  In practice we often work with short codes and perform a large number of
iterations. It is therefore interesting to consider what happens if in the
standard analysis we exchange the order in which the blocklength and the number
of iterations diverge to infinity. In particular, we can ask whether both
limits give the same threshold.
  Although empirical observations strongly suggest that the exchange of limits
is valid for all channel parameters, we limit our discussion to channel
parameters below the density evolution threshold. Specifically, we show that
under some suitable technical conditions the bit error probability vanishes
below the density evolution threshold regardless of how the limit is taken.
