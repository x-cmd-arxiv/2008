specify a preferred local frame. When matter moves slowly in this frame - the
so-called quasi-static regime - Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND) results.
Theories with such vectors (such as Einstein-aether) are prone to the vector
dynamics forming singularities which render their classical evolution
problematic. Here we analyse the dynamics of the vector in TeVeS in various
situations. We find that, quite generically, the vector field develops caustic
singularities on time scales of order the gravitational in-fall time. Having
shown singularity formation is generic with or without matter, Bekenstein's
original formulation of TeVeS appears dynamically problematic. We argue that by
modifying the vector field kinetic terms to the more general form used by
Einstein-Aether this problem may be avoided.

for determining the convolution kernel matching a pair of images of the same

a linear combination of basis functions, we consider the kernel as a discrete
pixel array and solve for the kernel pixel values directly using linear
least-squares. The removal of basis functions from the kernel model is
advantageous for a number of compelling reasons. Firstly, it removes the need
for the user to specify such functions, which makes for a much simpler user
application and avoids the risk of an inappropriate choice. Secondly, basis
functions are constructed around the origin of the kernel coordinate system,
which requires that the two images are perfectly aligned for an optimal result.
The pixel kernel model is sufficiently flexible to correct for image
misalignments, and in the case of a simple translation between images, image
resampling becomes unnecessary. Our new algorithm can be extended to spatially
varying kernels by solving for individual pixel kernels in a grid of image
sub-regions and interpolating the solutions to obtain the kernel at any one

between 0.3 and 0.8 GHz. The 3 dB bandwidth can be adjusted beyond this range
by changing the filter length. An extremely broad stopband at higher

attenuation and low reflected power across a broad stopband ensures that
spurious or unwanted signals outside the passband do not reach or return to the

support for the tidal model of the MS formation by Connors et al. (2006), which

stream appears much younger and may have originated from the Magellanic Bridge.
  We find an extensive population of HI clouds at the tip of the MS. Two thirds
of clouds have an angular size in the range 3.5'--10'. We interpret this as
being due to thermal instability, which would affect a warm tail of gas
trailing through the Galactic halo over a characteristic timescale of a few
Myrs to a few hundred Myrs. We show that thermal fragments can survive in the
hot halo for a long time, especially if surrounded by a <10^6 K halo gas. If
the observed clumpy structure is mainly due to thermal instability, then the
tip of the MS is at a distance of ~70 kpc. A significant fraction of HI clouds
at the tip of the MS show multi-phase velocity profiles, indicating the
co-existence of cooler and warmer gas.

In
non-relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, resulting in large
degeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin
and orbital motion leading to the well-known fine structure in their spectra.
The electronic states in defect-free carbon nanotubes (NTs) are widely believed
to be four-fold degenerate, due to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and
to also possess electron-hole symmetry. Here we report measurements
demonstrating that in clean NTs the spin and orbital motion of electrons are
coupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin-orbit coupling is
directly observed as a splitting of the four-fold degeneracy of a single
electron in ultra-clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment
of the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and anti-parallel
alignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories that
predict the existence of spin-orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it
as a spin-dependent topological phase in NTs. Our findings have important
implications for spin-based applications in carbon-based systems, entailing new
design principles for the realization of qubits in NTs and providing a
mechanism for all-electrical control of spins in NTs.

these channels is a pressing open question in quantum information theory. We
give a comprehensive review of what is currently known about the structure of
degradable quantum channels, including a number of new results as well as
alternate proofs of some known results. In the case of qubits, we provide a
complete characterization of all degradable channels with two dimensional
output, give a new proof that a qubit channel with two Kraus operators is
either degradable or anti-degradable and present a complete description of
anti-degradable unital qubit channels with a new proof.
  For higher output dimensions we explore the relationship between the output
and environment dimensions ($d_B$ and $d_E$ respectively) of degradable
channels. For several broad classes of channels we show that they can be
modeled with a environment that is ""small"" in the sense $d_E \leq d_B$. Perhaps
surprisingly, we also present examples of degradable channels with ``large''
environments, in the sense that the minimal dimension $d_E > d_B$. Indeed, one
can have $d_E > \tfrac{1}{4} d_B^2$.

subclass which are complements of entanglement breaking channels. We also

the edges of which are arcs of curves, with edge or mobile guards. Our focus is
on piecewise-convex polygons, i.e., polygons that are locally convex, except
possibly at the vertices, and their edges are convex arcs. We transform the
problem of monitoring a piecewise-convex polygon to the problem of 2-dominating
a properly defined triangulation graph with edges or diagonals, where
2-dominance requires that every triangle in the triangulation graph has at
least two of its vertices in its 2-dominating set. We show that
$\lfloor\frac{n+1}{3}\rfloor$ diagonal guards or $\lfloor\frac{2n+1}{5}\rfloor$
edge guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary, in order to
2-dominate a triangulation graph. Furthermore, we show how to compute: a
diagonal 2-dominating set of size $\lfloor\frac{n+1}{3}\rfloor$ in linear time,
an edge 2-dominating set of size $\lfloor\frac{2n+1}{5}\rfloor$ in $O(n^2)$
time, and an edge 2-dominating set of size $\lfloor\frac{3n}{7}\rfloor$ in O(n)
time. Based on the above-mentioned results, we prove that, for piecewise-convex
polygons, we can compute: a mobile guard set of size
$\lfloor\frac{n+1}{3}\rfloor$ in $O(n\log{}n)$ time, an edge guard set of size
$\lfloor\frac{2n+1}{5}\rfloor$ in $O(n^2)$ time, and an edge guard set of size
$\lfloor\frac{3n}{7}\rfloor$ in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. Finally, we show that
$\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor$ mobile or $\lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil$ edge guards are
sometimes necessary. When restricting our attention to monotone
piecewise-convex polygons, the bounds mentioned above drop:
$\lceil\frac{n+1}{4}\rceil$ edge or mobile guards are always sufficient and
sometimes necessary; such an edge or mobile guard set, of size at most
$\lceil\frac{n+1}{4}\rceil$, can be computed in O(n) time.

reason. Its contradictions were caused not by the orbit concept but by a mental
barrier--the inconceivability that an electron might collide with the atomic
nucleus. Removing that barrier resolves the theory's main failures--incorrect
orbital momenta, He atom, H2+ molecule ion. The inclusion of electron
oscillations through the nucleus--a concept called ""Coulomb
oscillator""--renders the old quantum theory consistent with quantum mechanics
(although devoid of wave character). The triple success of the Bohr-Sommerfeld
model is its correct description of the H atom (and one-electron ions)
concerning (1) the energy levels Enl, (2) the orbital angular momenta Lnl--if
corrected as Lnl^2 = l(l+1) hbar^2 and with the Coulomb oscillator
included--and (3) the orbits' space quantization--with (Lnl)z = ml hbar. These
achievements are succinctly represented by the principal, angular and magnetic
quantum numbers (n, l, ml) and visualized by orbital ellipse geometry--major
axis, vertex curvature, and tilt angle, respectively. Orbit geometry also
accounts for the average orbit size. Moreover, the Coulomb oscillator provides
a natural explanation of (isotropic) hyperfine interaction. The shortcomings of
the old quantum theory lie in its neglect of three properties of
particles--their spin, their wave nature and their quantum statistics. These
deficiencies notwithstanding, the visual appeal of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model
remains a pedagogical asset to complement the abstract character of quantum

is coiled as a spiral. Whether this specific shape influences hearing is still
an open problem. By employing a three dimensional fluid model of the cochlea
with an idealized geometry, the influence of the spiral geometry of the cochlea
is examined. We obtain solutions of the model through a conformal
transformation in a long-wave approximation. Our results show that the net
pressure acting on the basilar membrane is not uniform along its spanwise
direction. Also, it is shown that the location of the maximum of the spanwise
pressure difference in the axial direction has a mode dependence. In the
simplest pattern, the present result is consistent with the previous theory
based on the WKB-like approximation [D. Manoussaki, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96,
088701(2006)]. In this mode, the pressure difference in the spanwise direction
is a monotonic function of the distance from the apex and the normal velocity
across the channel width is zero. Thus in the lowest order approximation, we
can neglect the existance of the Reissner's membrane in the upper channel.
However, higher responsive modes show different behavior and, thus, the real
maximum is expected to be located not exactly at the apex, but at a position
determined by the spiral geometry of the cochlea and the width of the cochlear
duct. In these modes, the spanwise normal velocities are not zero. Thus, it
indicates that one should take into account of the detailed geometry of the
cochlear duct for a more quantitative result. The present result clearly
demonstrates that not only the spiral geometry, but also the geometry of the
cochlear duct play decisive roles in distributing the wave energy.

ionization and velocity are mapped as a function of the distance to the central
QSO. In the majority of the cases, the QSO significantly contributes to the gas
ionization in its whole host galaxy, and sometimes even outside.
  Reflection or scattering of the QSO \ha line from remote regions of the
galaxy is detected in several instances. The line shifts show that, in all
cases, the matter responsible for the light reflection moves away from the QSO,
likely accelerated by its radiation pressure.
  The two faintest QSOs reside in spirals, with some signs of a past
gravitational perturbation. One of the intermediate luminosity QSOs resides in
a massive elliptical containing gas ionized (and probably pushed away) by the
QSO radiation. The other medium-power object is found in a spiral galaxy
displaying complex velocity structure, with the central QSO moving with respect
to the bulge, probably as a result of a galactic collision. The two most
powerful objects are involved in violent gravitational interactions and one of
them has no detected host.
  These results suggest that (1) large-scale phenomena, such as galactic
collisions, are closely related to the triggering and the feeding of the QSO
and (2) once ignited, the QSO has significant influence on its large-scale

together with finite, unambigious {\it quantum spacetime} corrections. Another
aspect of holography ensues for radiant black holes treated as a standard
canonical ensemble with Isolated Horizons as the mean (equilibrium)
configuration. This is shown to yield a universal criterion for thermal
stability of generic radiant black holes, as a lower bound on the mass of the

of the bound occurs at a phase boundary separating thermally stable and

first one, which we call ``self-consistency condition'', concerns the algorithm
itself, and the second, called ``dependency control condition'' is related to
the dependency assumptions on the $p$-value family. Many standard multiple
testing procedures are self-consistent (e.g. step-up, step-down or step-up-down
procedures), and we prove that the dependency control condition can be
fulfilled when choosing correspondingly appropriate rejection functions, in
three classical types of dependency: independence, positive dependency (PRDS)

through simple and unifying proofs while extending their scope to several
regards: weighted FDR, $p$-value reweighting, new family of step-up procedures

additional examples of other possible applications. This framework also allows
for defining and studying FDR control for multiple testing procedures over a

jump times of a Cox process, which is a Poisson process conditional on the
realization of its intensity. We assume that the intensity follows the
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. This model allows one to calculate survival
probabilities and prices of defaultable bonds explicitly. In this paper we
assume that the Brownian motion, that drives the intensity, is not observed.
Using filtering theory for point process observations, we are able to derive
dynamics for the intensity and its moment generating function, given the
observations of the Cox process. A transformation of the dynamics of the
conditional moment generating function allows us to solve the filtering
problem, between the jumps of the Cox process, as well as at the jumps.
Assuming that the initial distribution of the intensity is of the Gamma type,
we obtain an explicit solution to the filtering problem for all t>0. We
conclude the paper with the observation that the resulting conditional moment
generating function at time t corresponds to a mixture of Gamma distributions.

of the powers and damping times of these low-frequency modes are found by
extrapolating the observed powers and widths of higher-frequency modes with
large observed signal-to-noise ratios. The extrapolations predict that the
low-frequency modes will have small signal-to-noise ratios and narrow widths in
a frequency-power spectrum. Monte Carlo simulations were then performed where
timeseries containing mode signals and normally distributed Gaussian noise were
produced. The mode signals were simulated to have the powers and damping times
predicted by the extrapolations. Various statistical tests were then performed
on the frequency-amplitude spectra formed from these timeseries to investigate
the fraction of spectra in which the modes could be detected. The results of
these simulations were then compared to the number of p-modes candidates
observed in real Sun-as-a-star data at low frequencies. The fraction of
simulated spectra in which modes were detected decreases rapidly as the
frequency of modes decreases and so the fraction of simulations in which the
low-frequency modes were detected was very small. However, increasing the
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the low-frequency modes by a factor of 2 above
the extrapolated values led to significantly more detections. Therefore efforts
should continue to further improve the quality of solar data that is currently

distribution and properties of the cloud members and candidate pre-main
sequence (PMS) objects and their circumstellar matter. From the analysis of the
volume density of the PMS objects and candidates we find two tight groups of
objects with volume densities higher than 25 solar masses per cubic parsec and
5-10 members each. These groups correlate well in space with the regions of
high extinction. A multiplicity fraction of about 13% is observed for objects
with separations between 0.8"" and 6.0"". Using the results of masses and ages
from a companion paper, we estimate the star formation efficiency to be 1-4%
significantly lower than for Cha I. This might mean that different
star-formation activities in the Chamaeleon clouds reflect a different history
of star formation. We also find that the Cha II cloud is turning some 6-7 solar
masses into stars every Myr, which is low in comparison with the star formation
rate in other c2d clouds. On the other hand, the disk fraction of 70-80% that
we estimate in Cha II is much higher than in other star forming regions and
indicates that the population in this cloud is dominated by objects with active
accretion. Finally, the Cha II outflows are discussed, with particular regard
to the discovery of a new Herbig-Haro outflow, HH 939, driven by the classical

some algebraic properties of Osborn loops with the WIP i.e universal weak
WIPLs. So this work exempts the WIP. Two new loop identities, namely left self

cryptography in a similar spirit in which the cross inverse property has been

do not have the LSIP or RSIP or 3-PAPL or weaker forms of inverse property,
power associativity and diassociativity to mention a few, will have cycles(even

the impact of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear (ISM) in the early
stages of radio source evolution. We observe spatially extended line emission
(up to 20 kpc) in the majority of sources which is consistent with a quiescent
halo. In the nuclear apertures we observe broad, highly complex emission line
profiles. Multiple Gaussian modelling of the [O III]5007 line reveals 2-4
components which can have FWHM and blueshifts relative to the halo of up to
2000 km/s. We interpret these broad, blueshifted components as material in
outflow and discuss the kinematical evidence for jet-driven outflows.
Comparisons with samples in the literature show that compact radio sources
harbour more extreme nuclear kinematics than their extended counterparts, a
trend seen within our sample with larger velocities in the smaller sources. The
observed velocities are also likely to be influenced by source orientation with
respect to the observer's line of sight. Nine sources have associated HI
absorption. In common with the optical emission line gas, the HI profiles are
often highly complex with the majority of the detected components significantly
blueshifted, tracing outflows in the neutral gas. The sample has been tested
for stratification in the ISM (FWHM/ionisation potential/critical density) as
suggested by Holt et al. (2003) for PKS1345+12 but we find no significant
trends within the sample using a Spearman Rank analysis. This study supports
the idea that compact radio sources are young radio loud AGN observed during
the early stages of their evolution and currently shedding their natal cocoons
through extreme circumnuclear outflows.

localization conditions for electrons on the one dimensional lattice under

proceed again in terms of sums of products of Bessel functions of the first

times $\pi $ and the quotients between the Bloch frequency and the ones
characterizing competing fields. Tuning the phases of time dependent
modulations leads to interesting frequency mixing effects providing an
appreciable simplification of dynamic localization conditions one looks for.
The understanding is that proceeding in this manner, the time dependent
superposition mentioned above gets reduced effectively to the influence of
individual ac-fields exhibiting mixed frequency quotients. Besides pure field
limits and superpositions between uniform electric and time dependent magnetic

to supernova explosions affects the shape of the initial cluster mass function,
that is, the mass function of star clusters when effects of gas expulsion are
over. We demonstrate that if the radii of cluster-forming gas cores are roughly
constant over the core mass range, as supported by observations, then more
massive cores undergo slower gas expulsion. Therefore, for a given star
formation efficiency, more massive cores retain a larger fraction of stars
after gas expulsion. The initial cluster mass function may thus differ from the
core mass function substantially, with the final shape depending on the star
formation efficiency. A mass-independent star formation efficiency of about 20
per cent turns a power-law core mass function into a bell-shaped initial
cluster mass function, while mass-independent efficiencies of order 40 per cent
preserve the shape of the core mass function.

magnetoresistance monotonously decreases with increasing the contact
cross-section. However, for a certain choice of parameters the calculations
show non-monotonous behavior of the magnetoresistance in the region in which
the diameter of the contact becomes comparable with the mean-free path of
electrons. We attribute this effect to different conduction regimes in the
vicinity of the nanocontact: ballistic for electrons of one spin projection,
and simultaneously diffusive for the other. Furthermore, at certain
combinations of spin asymmetries of the bulk mean-free paths in a
heterocontact, the magnetoresistance can be almost constant, or may even grow
as the contact diameter increases. Thus, our calculations suggest a way to
search for combinations of material parameters, for which high
magnetoresistances can be achieved not only at the nanometric size of the
contact, but also at much larger cross-sections of nanocontacts which can be
easier for fabrication with current technologies. The trial calculations of the
magnetoresistance with material parameters close to those for the Mumetal-Ni
heterocontacts agree satisfactorily with the available experimental data.

low-frequency-component of the production rate. The full spectral function is
determined numerically and shows remarkable similarity to computations of the
photon production rate in AdS-duals of $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with massive
flavor. It is further support that Soft-Wall AdS-QCD correctly captures the IR
physics of the chiral perturbation theory regime of QCD. We confirm this by
relating the IR-effects of the massive flavor deformations to the AdS/QCD soft
wall cut-off. The AdS/QCD spectral function is smooth, however, and unlike
massive flavor models shows no spectral peaks.

potential and study analytic continuation of eigenvalues, as functions of the
coefficient of the potential. We prove several properties of this analytic
continuation conjectured by Bender, Wu, Loeffel and Martin. 1. All eigenvalues
are given by branches of two multi-valued analytic functions, one for even
eigenfunctions and one for odd ones. 2. The only singularities of these
multi-valued functions in the complex plane are algebraic ramification points,
and there are only finitely many singularities over each compact subset of the
plane.

been intensively studied in the different magnetic systems, including
multilayers and granular films, to examine which mechanism, skew scattering or
side-jump, dominates. The basis of the scaling law is that both the
resistivities are due to the electron scattering at the imperfections in the
materials. By studying of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the simple Fe/Cu
bilayers, we demonstrate that the measured anomalous Hall effect should not
follow the scaling laws derived from skew scattering or side-jump mechanism due
to the short-circuit and shunting effects of the non-magnetic layers.
