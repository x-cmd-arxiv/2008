nanoribbon, with rough edges. The confinement is implemented by a large mass in
the Hamiltonian or by imposing boundary conditions directly on the graphene
wave-functions. The scattering of a rough edge leads to a transverse
channel-mixing and provides crucial limitation to the quantum transport in
narrow ribbons. We solve the problem perturbatively and find the edge
scattering contribution to the conductivity, which can be measured
experimentally. The case of Schroedinger particles in a strip is also
addressed, and the comparison between Schroedinger and Dirac transport is made.
Anomalies associated with quasi-one dimensionality, such as Van Hove
singularities and localization, are discussed. The violation of the Matthiessen

on a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations in
cosmology. The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the
properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from those
galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. The observed
galaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes must
be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution and
noise. The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant
progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting
Program (STEP). Via STEP, we have run challenges within our own community, and
come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally
matched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computational
learning. Thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we are
seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. This document details

modulation and the hardness in Cyg X-1 in the hard state on its superorbital
phase. Our results can be well modelled as a combination of two effects: the
precession of the accretion disc (which causes the superorbital flux
modulation) and the orbital-phase dependent X-ray absorption in an accretion
bulge, located at the accretion disc edge close to the supergiant companion but
displaced from the line connecting the stars by about 25^o. Our findings are
supported by the distribution of the X-ray dips showing concentration towards
zero superorbital phase, which corresponds to the bulge passing through the
line of sight. We Fourier analyse our model, and find it explains the previous
finding of asymmetric beat (between the orbital and superorbital modulations)
frequencies in the observed power spectrum, provided the disc precession is
prograde. We find no statistically significant changes of the orbital
modulation with the superorbital phase in the 15-GHz radio data. This absence
is consistent with the radio being emitted by a jet in the system, in which
case the orbital modulation is caused by wind absorption far away from the
disc. We also find that both the X-ray and radio fluxes of Cyg X-1 in the hard
state on time scales >10^4-s have lognormal distributions, which complements a
previous finding of a lognormal flux distribution in the hard state on 1-s time
scales. We point out that the lognormal character of the flux distribution
requires that flux logarithms rather than fluxes themselves should be used for
averaging and error analysis. We also provide a correct formula for the
uncertainty of rms of a light curve for the case when the uncertainty is higher
than the measurement.

cluster population, with the purpose of measuring the CC fraction out to
redshift 0.7 < z < 1.4. Using a sample of nearby clusters spanning a wide range
of morphologies, we define criteria to characterize cool cores, which are
applicable to the high redshift sample. We analyzed azimuthally averaged
surface brightness (SB) profiles using the known scaling relations and fitted
single/double beta models to the data. Additionally, we measured a surface
brightness concentration, c_SB, as the ratio of the peak over the ambient SB.
To verify that this is an unbiased parameter as a function of redshift, we
developed a model independent ""cloning"" technique to simulate the nearby
clusters as they would appear at the same redshifts and luminosities as those
in the distant sample. A more physical parameterization of CC presence is
obtained by computing the cooling time at a radius of 20 kpc from the cluster
center. The distribution of the SB concentration and the stacked radial
profiles of the low-z sample, combined with published information on the CC
properties of these clusters, show 3 degrees of SB cuspiness: non-CC, moderate
and strong CC. The same analysis applied to the high-z clusters reveals two
regimes: non-CC and moderate CC. The cooling time distribution corroborates
this result by showing a strong negative correlation with c_SB. Our analysis
indicates a significant fraction of distant clusters harboring a moderate CC
out to z=1.4, similar to those found in the local sample. The absence of strong
cooling which we report is likely linked with a higher merger rate expected at
redshift z > 0.7, and should also be related with the shorter age of distant
clusters, implying less time to develop a cool core.

reconstruction starts from assumed values of the Galactic potential and a
distance to one point on the orbit, but with noise-free data the condition that
energy be conserved on the orbit enables one to reject incorrect assumptions.
The performance of the algorithm is investigated when errors are added to the
input data that are comparable to those in published data for the streams of
Pal 5. It is found that the algorithm returns distances and proper motions that
are accurate to of order one percent, and enables one to reject quite
reasonable but incorrect trial potentials. In practical applications it will be
important to minimize errors in the input data, and there is considerable scope
for doing this.

bosonic universality class (Nambu-Goto) as the fundamental string. When we
compare the continuum k-string tensions to the corresponding fundamental string
tensions, we find that the ratios are close to, but typically 1-2 percent
above, the Casimir scaling values favoured by some theoretical approaches.
Fitting the N-dependence in a model-independent way favours an expansion in 1/N
(as in Casimir scaling) rather than the 1/N^2 that is suggested by naive colour
counting. We also observe that the low-lying spectrum of k-string states falls

  press",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078961",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: The bright southern Cepheid RS Pup is surrounded by a circumstellar
nebula reflecting the light from the central star. The propagation of the light
variations from the Cepheid inside the dusty nebula creates spectacular light
echoes that can be observed up to large distances from the star itself. This
phenomenon is currently unique in this class of stars. Aims: For this
relatively distant star, the trigonometric parallax available from Hipparcos
has a low accuracy. A careful observation of the light echoes has the potential
to provide a very accurate, geometric distance to RS Pup. Methods: We obtained
a series of CCD images of RS Pup with the NTT/EMMI instrument, covering the
variation period of the star (P=41.4d). This allowed us to track the
progression of the light wavefronts over the nebular features surrounding the
star. We measured precisely the phase lag of the photometric variation in
several regions of the circumstellar nebula. Results: From our phase lag
measurements, we derived a geometric distance of 1992 +/- 28 pc to RS Pup. This
distance is affected by a total uncertainty of 1.4%, and corresponds to a
parallax of pi = 0.502 +/- 0.007 mas and a distance modulus of mu = 11.50 +/-
0.03. Conclusions: The geometric distance we derived is by far the most
accurate to a Cepheid, and among the most accurate to any star. RS Pup appears
both as somewhat neglected and particularly promising to investigate the
mass-loss history of Cepheids. Thanks to its highly accurate distance, it is
also bound to become an important luminosity fiducial for the long period part
of the period-luminosity diagram.

the study of acoustic modes. Since the radius of the inner turning point of a
resonant acoustic mode is inversely proportional to the ratio of its frequency
to its degree, only the low-degree p modes reach the core. The higher the order
of these modes, the deeper they penetrate into the Sun and thus they carry more
diagnostic information on the inner regions. Unfortunately, the estimates of
frequency splittings at high frequency from Sun-as-a-star measurements have
higher observational errors due to mode blending, resulting in weaker
constraints on the rotation profile in the inner core. Therefore inversions for
the solar internal rotation use only modes below 2.4 mHz for l < 4. In the work

frequency splittings for modes l < 4 using velocities measured with the GOLF

$\ell_1-\ell_2$ regularization (the group Lasso). The key condition is that the
dimensionality $p_n$ can increase much faster than the sample size $n$, i.e.
$p_n \gg n$ (in our case $p_n$ is the number of groups), but the number of
relevant groups is small. The main conclusion is that many good properties from
$\ell_1-$regularization (Lasso) naturally carry on to the $\ell_1-\ell_q$ cases
($1 \leq q \leq \infty$), even if the number of variables within each group
also increases with the sample size. With fixed design, we show that the whole

random design under a much weaker condition. These results provide a unified

$q=\infty$ (iCAP), with $q=2$ (group Lasso)as a special case. When there is no

kinetic scheme (KS) from the statistical properties of a two-state trajectory.
However, the mapping of a KS into a two-state trajectory leads to the loss of
information about the KS, and so, in many cases, more than one KS can be
associated with the data. We recently showed that the optimal way to solve this
problem is to use canonical forms of reduced dimensions (RD). RD forms are
on-off networks with connections only between substates of different states,
where the connections can have non-exponential waiting time probability density
functions (WT-PDFs). In theory, only a single RD form can be associated with
the data. To utilize RD forms in the analysis of the data, a RD form should be
associated with the data. Here, we give a toolbox for building a RD form from a
finite two-state trajectory. The methods in the toolbox are based on known
statistical methods in data analysis, combined with statistical methods and
numerical algorithms designed specifically for the current problem. Our toolbox
is self-contained - it builds a mechanism based only on the information it
extracts from the data, and its implementation on the data is fast (analyzing a
10^6 cycle trajectory from a thirty-parameter mechanism takes a couple of hours
on a PC with a 2.66 GHz processor). The toolbox is automated and is freely

galaxies can be used to obtain geometric distance estimates and derive the
Hubble constant. The ultimate precision of such measurements could be limited
by uncertainties in the disk geometry. Using a time-dependent linear theory
model, we study the evolution of a thin initially eccentric disk under
conditions appropriate to sub-pc scales in Active Galactic Nuclei. The
evolution is controlled by a combination of differential precession driven by
the disk potential and propagating eccentricity waves that are damped by
viscosity. A simple estimate yields a circularization timescale of
approximately 10 Myr at 0.1 pc. Numerical solutions for the eccentricity
evolution confirm that damping commences on this timescale, but show that the
subsequent decay rate of the eccentricity depends upon the uncertain strength
of viscous damping of eccentricity. If eccentricity waves are important further
decay of the eccentricity can be slow, with full circularization requiring up
to 50 Myr for disks at radii of 0.1 pc to 0.2 pc. Observationally, this implies
that it is plausible that enough time has elapsed for the eccentricity of
masing disks to have been substantially damped, but that it may not be
justified to assume vanishing eccentricity. We predict that during the damping
phase the pericenter of the eccentric orbits describes a moderately tightly
wound spiral with radius.

scale a_0 in Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is tied to the scale
of the cosmos, and must thus evolve. With the advent of relativistic
implementations of the modified dynamics, one can address the issue of
variability of the two gravitational ''constants'' with some confidence. Using
TeVeS, the Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravitational theory, as an implementation of
MOND, we calculate the dependence of G_N and a_0 on the TeVeS parameters and
the coeval cosmological value of its scalar field, \phi_c. We find that G_N,
when expressed in atomic units, is strictly nonevolving, a result fully
consistent with recent empirical limits on the variation of G_N. By contrast,
we find that a_0 depends on \phi_c and may thus vary with cosmological epoch.
However, for the brand of TeVeS which seems most promising, a_0 variation
occurs on a timescale much longer than Hubble's, and should be imperceptible
back to redshift unity or even beyond it. This is consistent with emergent data
on the rotation curves of disk galaxies at significants redshifts.

radio--through--X-ray flux from XBLs is nonthermal synchrotron radiation
emitted by isotropically-distributed electrons in the randomly oriented
magnetic field of a relativistic blazar jet, we obtain the electron spectrum.
This spectrum is then used to deduce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
spectrum as a function of the Doppler factor, magnetic field, and variability
timescale. The variability timescale is used to infer the comoving blob radius
from light travel-time arguments, leaving only two parameters. With this
approach, we accurately simulate the synchrotron and SSC spectrum of flaring
XBLs in the Thomson through Klein-Nishina regimes. Photoabsorption by
interactions with internal jet radiation and the intergalactic background light
(IBL) is included. Doppler factors, magnetic fields, and absolute jet powers
are obtained by fitting the {\em HESS} and {\em Swift} data of the recent giant
TeV flare observed from \object{PKS 2155--304}. For the contemporaneous {\em

these scales where the Casimir force between the plates changes sign. For the
cutoff energy scale required to reproduce the observed value of the
cosmological constant, we find that the Casimir force changes sign and becomes
repulsive for plate separations less than a critical separation $d_0=0.6mm$,
assuming a zero radius of the extra dimension (no extra dimension). This
prediction contradicts Casimir experiments which indicate an attractive force
down to plate separations of $100nm$. For a non-zero extra dimension radius,
the critical separation $d_0$ gets even larger than $0.6mm$ and remains

Here we investigate the impact of the next generation of Extremely Large

suitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. Assuming photon-noise limited
observations and using extensive Monte Carlo simulations we determine the
accuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the Ly alpha forest
as a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. Based on this relation and using
the brightness and redshift distributions of known QSOs we find that a 42-m
telescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over a
period of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. Such an experiment would
provide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assuming
spatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any other

tides over the lifetimes of the planets, i.e., the earlier gas disk migration
did not bring all planets to their current orbits. As the orbits tidally
evolved, there was substantial tidal heating within the planets. The past tidal
heating of each planet may have contributed significantly to the thermal budget
that governed the planet's physical properties, including its radius, which in
many cases may be measured by observing transit events. Here we also compute

measured radii, including HD 209458 b. We show that they may have undergone
substantial tidal heating during the past billion years, perhaps enough to
explain their large radii. Theoretical models of exoplanet interiors and the
corresponding radii should include the role of large and time-variable tidal
heating. Our results may have important implications for planet formation
models, physical models of ""hot Jupiters"", and the success of transit surveys.

understand how all compactification moduli are stabilized, since there are
several mechanisms. For example, it is possible to generate a scalar potential
either classically or through nonperturbative effects, such as gaugino

example the dilaton. On the other hand, a background of thermal matter with
moduli-dependent masses can also stabilize certain of the moduli, e.g., the
radion. It is important to understand whether these two distinct mechanisms are
compatible with each other, that is, that there are no interference terms that
could spoil the moduli stabilization. In this paper, we study heterotic string
theory on an N=1 orbifold near an enhanced symmetry point. We then consider
both a nonperturbatively generated potential and a gas of strings with

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with a coding problem called complementary delivery, where
messages from two correlated sources are jointly encoded and each decoder
reproduces one of two messages using the other message as the side information.
Both lossless and lossy universal complementary delivery coding schemes are
investigated. In the lossless case, it is demonstrated that a universal
complementary delivery code can be constructed by only combining two
Slepian-Wolf codes. Especially, it is shown that a universal lossless
complementary delivery code, for which error probability is exponentially
tight, can be constructed from two linear Slepian-Wolf codes. In the lossy
case, a universal complementary delivery coding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv codes
is proposed. While the proposed scheme cannot attain the optimal
rate-distortion trade-off in general, the rate-loss is upper bounded by a
universal constant under some mild conditions. The proposed schemes allows us
to apply any Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv codes to complementary delivery coding.

shown that maximum mutual information corresponds to constant Fisher

subset of the population to persist under stress. In mycobacteria, stresses
like nutrient and oxygen deprivation activate the stress response pathway
involving the two-component system MprAB and the sigma factor, SigE. SigE in
turn activates the expression of the stringent response regulator, rel. The
enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1) regulates this pathway by synthesizing
polyphosphate required for the activation of MprB. The precise manner in which
only a subpopulation of bacterial cells develops persistence, remains unknown.
Rel is required for mycobacterial persistence. Here we show that the
distribution of rel expression levels in a growing population of mycobacteria
is bimodal with two distinct peaks corresponding to low (L) and high (H)
expression states, and further establish that a positive feedback loop
involving the mprAB operon along with stochastic gene expression are
responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity. Combining single cell analysis by
flow cytometry with theoretical modeling, we observe that during growth,
noise-driven transitions take a subpopulation of cells from the L to the H
state within a ""window of opportunity"" in time preceding the stationary phase.
We find evidence of hysteresis in the expression of rel in response to changing
concentrations of PPK1. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence that
bistability and stochastic gene expression could be important for the
development of ""heterogeneity with an advantage"" in mycobacteria.

we are able to confirm the presence of a magnetic field at the surface of

polarity of the magnetic field has reversed with respect to our previous
observation (obtained a year before), strongly suggesting that tauBoo is
undergoing magnetic cycles similar to those of the Sun. This is the first time
that a global magnetic polarity switch is observed in a star other than the
Sun; we speculate that the magnetic cycle period of tauBoo is much shorter than
that of the Sun.
  Our new data also allow us to confirm the presence of differential rotation
from the latitudinal shearing that the magnetic structure is undergoing. The
differential rotation surface shear that tauBoo experiences is found to be 6 to
10 times larger than that of the Sun. We propose that the short magnetic cycle
period is due to the strong level of differential rotation. With a rotation
period of 3.0 and 3.9 d at the equator and pole respectively, tauBoo appears as
the first planet-hosting star whose rotation (at intermediate latitudes) is
synchronised with the orbital motion of its giant planet (period 3.3 d).
Assuming that this synchronisation is not coincidental, it suggests that the
tidal effects induced by the giant planet can be strong enough to force the
thin convective enveloppe (though not the whole star) into corotation and thus
to play a role in the activity cycle of tauBoo.

of games that encapsulates both ""local"" dependencies as in graphical games, and
partial indifference to other agents' identities as in anonymous games, which
occur in many natural settings. This is achieved by specifying a graph on the
set of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends
only on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the
action graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing
mixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of
agent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness
results for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is
unconstrained. In particular, we show that even if the action graph is a tree,
but the number of agent-types is unconstrained, it is NP-complete to decide the
existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a
mixed Nash equilibrium (even an approximate one); similarly for symmetric AGGs
(all agents belong to a single type), if we allow arbitrary treewidth. These
hardness results suggest that, in some sense, our PTAS is as strong of a
positive result as one can expect.

The second and main part of my thesis is devoted to establishing a local
existence and uniqueness theorem for the wave equation on singular space-times.
The singular Lorentz metric subject to our discussion is modeled within the
special algebra on manifolds in the sense of Colombeau. Inspired by an approach
to generalized hyperbolicity of conical-space times due to Vickers and Wilson,
we succeed in establishing certain energy estimates, which by a further
elaborated equivalence of energy integrals and Sobolev norms allow us to prove
existence and uniqueness of local generalized solutions of the wave equation

significant population of globular clusters in M60, and a large number of young
luminous clusters in NGC 4647, a small companion spiral galaxy north-west of
M60. The color distribution of the globular clusters in M60 is clearly bimodal,
with a blue peak at (C-T_1)=1.37, and a red peak at (C-T_1)=1.87. We derive two
new transformation relations between the (C-T_1)_0 color and [Fe/H] using the
data for the globular clusters in our Galaxy and M49. Using these relations we
derive the metallicity distribution of the globular clusters in M60, which is
also bimodal: a dominant metal-poor component with center at [Fe/H]=-1.2, and a
weaker metal-rich component with center at [Fe/H]=-0.2. The radial number
density profile of the globular clusters is more extended than that of the
stellar halo, and the radial number density profile of the blue globular
clusters is more extended than that of the red globular clusters. The number
density maps of the globular clusters show that the spatial distribution of the
blue globular clusters is roughly circular, while that of the red globular
cluster is elongated similarly to that of the stellar halo. We estimate the
total number of the globular clusters in M60 to be 3600+/-500$,and the specific
frequency to be S_N=3.8+/-0.4. The mean color of the bright blue globular
clusters gets redder as they get brighter in both the inner and outer region of

orbiting within host halos that form in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark
Matter (WDM) cosmologies. Our study focuses on selected properties of these
subhalos, namely their anisotropic spatial distribution within the hosts; the
existence of a ""backsplash'' population; the age-distance relation; the degree
to which they suffer mass loss; and the distribution of relative (infall)
velocities with respect to the hosts. We find that the number density of
subhalos in our WDM model is suppressed relative to that in the CDM model, as
we would expect. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that backsplash subhalos
exist in both the WDM and CDM models. Indeed, there are no statistically
significant differences between the spatial distributions of subhalos in the
CDM and WDM models. There is evidence that subhalos in the WDM model suffer
enhanced mass loss relative to their counterparts in the CDM model, reflecting
their lower central densities. We note also a tendency for the (infall)
velocities of subhalos in the WDM model to be higher than in the CDM model.
Nevertheless, we conclude that observational tests based on either the spatial
distribution or the kinematics of the subhalo population are unlikely to help
us to differentiate between the CDM model and our adopted WDM model.

starting from about 5 hours after the GRB and during 5 consecutive nights were

approximately as a power law with an index of -1.14+-0.02. After that the
variability on the time scale \delta t < t is observed and the afterglow
started to decay faster. The color of the afterglow, V-R=~0.5, is approximately
the same during all our observations. The variability is detected on time
scales up to \delta t/t =~ 0.0055 at \Delta F_\nu/F_\nu =~ 0.3, which violates

afterglow is emitted by external shock, which is produced by the interaction of
ultrarelativistic ejecta with the ambient interstellar medium, within the
framework of simple models. The corresponding constraints were established by
Ioka et al. (2005) and in some cases are inconsistent with observations. On the
other hand, if the motion is not relativistic, then the fast variability of the
afterglow can be explained much more easily.
  In this connection we discuss various estimates of the time of the transition
to subrelativistic motion in GRB source. We point out, that this transition
should occur on an observed time scale of ~10 days. In the case of a higher
density of the ambient interstellar medium ~10^2-10^4 cm^{-3} or dense stellar
wind with \dot M ~ 10^{-5} - 10^{-4} M_\odot/year the transition to a
subrelativistic motion can occur on a time scale of ~1 day. These densities may
well be expected in star-forming regions and around massive Wolf-Rayet stars.

improve on previous determinations of the HIMF by its combination of depth,
wide area and centroiding accuracy, the latter allowing, in most cases,
immediate identification of the optical counterpart to each HI signal. ALFALFA
will detect hundreds of galaxies with HI masses less than 10**7.5 solar masses
and also greater than 10**10.5 solar masses, and its final catalog will allow
investigation of the dependence of the HIMF both on local density and on galaxy
morphology. Already ALFALFA confirms previous suggestions that there is no
cosmologically significant population of HI-rich dark galaxies. Fewer than 3%
of all extragalactic HI sources and < 1% of ones with HI masses > 10**9.5 solar
masses cannot be identified with a stellar counterpart. Very preliminary
results on the presence of gas-rich dwarfs in the void in front of the
Pisces-Perseus supercluster suggest an underabundance of such objects compared
to the predictions of numerical simulations. The objects with highest HI mass
exhibit a range of morphologies and optical colors and surface brightnesses but
all appear to be massive disk systems. The latter represent the population
likely to dominate future studies of HI at higher redshift with the Square

displays a soft X-ray emission, a precursor before the onset of the main event,
and also a soft X-ray tail after the end of the main peak. The light curves in
four different energy bands display different features; At higher energy bands
several peaks are seen in the light curve, while at lower energy bands a single
broader bump dominates. It is expected that these different features are the
result of a mixture of several components each of which has different
energetics and variability. To reveal the nature of each component, we analysed
the time resolved spectra and they are successfully resolved into several
components. We also found that these components can be classified into two
distinct classes; One is a component which has an exponential decay of $E_{p}$
with a characteristic timescale shorter than $\sim$ 30 sec, and its spectrum is
well represented by a broken power law function, which is frequently observed
in many prompt GRB emissions, so it should have an internal-shock origin.
Another is a component whose $E_{p}$ is almost unchanged with characteristic
timescale longer than $\sim$ 60 sec, and shows a very soft emission and slower
variability. The spectrum of the soft component is characterized by either a
broken power law or a black body spectrum. This component might originate from
a relatively wider and lower velocity jet or a photosphere of the fireball. By
assuming that the soft component is a thermal emission, the radiation radius is
initially $4.4 \times 10^{6}$ km, which is a typical radius of a blue
supergiant, and its expansion velocity is $2.4 \times 10^{5}$ km/s in the
source frame.

fluorescence emission of UV photons on a wide range of their spectrum. The
induced fluorescence flux is dominated by GRB photons from 0.1 to about 100 MeV
and, once the extinction through the atmosphere is taken into account, it is
distributed over a wide angular region. This flux can be detected through a
monitor of the diffuse photon flux, provided that its maximum value exceeds a
threshold value, that is primarily determined by the sky brightness above the
detector. The feasibility of this search and the expected rates are discussed
on the basis of the current GRB observations and the existing fluorescence
detectors.

illustration of this phenomenon is provided by the aerial display of vast
flocks of starlings gathering at dusk over the roost and swirling with
extraordinary spatial coherence. Both the evolutionary justification and the
mechanistic laws of flocking are poorly understood, arguably because of a lack
of data on large flocks. Here, we report a quantitative study of aerial
display. We measured the individual three-dimensional positions in compact
flocks of up to 2700 birds. We investigated the main features of the flock as a
whole - shape, movement, density and structure - and discuss these as emergent
attributes of the grouping phenomenon. We find that flocks are relatively thin,
with variable sizes, but constant proportions. They tend to slide parallel to
the ground and, during turns, their orientation changes with respect to the
direction of motion. Individual birds keep a minimum distance from each other
that is comparable to their wingspan. The density within the aggregations is
non-homogeneous, as birds are packed more tightly at the border compared to the
centre of the flock. These results constitute the first set of large-scale data
on three-dimensional animal aggregations. Current models and theories of
collective animal behaviour can now be tested against these results.
