explosions, the primary, l=1, g-mode in the core of the proto-neutron star is
excited to an energy of ~ 10^{50} ergs and damps by the emission of sound
waves. Here we calculate the damping of the primary mode by the parametric
instability, i.e., by nonlinear, 3-mode coupling between the low-order primary
mode and pairs of high-order g-modes. We show that the primary mode is strongly
coupled to highly resonant, neutrino damped pairs with n>10; such short
wavelength interactions cannot be resolved in the simulations. We find that the
parametric instability saturates the primary mode energy at ~10^{48} ergs, well
below the energy needed to drive an explosion. We therefore conclude that
acoustic power is unlikely to be energetically significant in core-collapse
supernova explosions.

Miller et al. (2007) and use the method to estimate the shear from the Shear
TEsting Programme simulations (STEP). The method uses a fast model fitting
algorithm which uses realistic galaxy profiles and analytically marginalises
over the position and amplitude of the model by doing the model fitting in
Fourier space. This is used to find the full posterior probability in
ellipticity so that the shear can be estimated in a fully Bayesian way. The
Bayesian shear estimation allows measurement bias arising from the presence of
random noise to be removed. In this paper we introduce an iterative algorithm
that can be used to estimate the intrinsic ellipticity prior and show that this
is accurate and stable. By using the method to estimate the shear from the
STEP1 simulations we find the method to have a shear bias of m ~ 0.005 and a
variation in shear offset with PSF type of sigma_c ~ 0.0002. These values are
smaller than for any method presented in the STEP1 publication that behaves
linearly with shear. Using the method to estimate the shear from the STEP2
simulations we find than the shear bias and offset are m ~ 0.002 and c ~
-0.0007 respectively. In addition we find that the bias and offset are stable
to changes in magnitude and size of the galaxies. Such biases should yield any
cosmological constraints from future weak lensing surveys robust to systematic
effects in shape measurement.

be manipulated like any standard quantum gate, thus simplifying in certain
circumstances the task of computing the overall effect of the noise at each
stage of the protocol. This approach yields equivalent results to those derived
from the Lindblad equation; yet, as we show, it represents a handy and fast
tool for performing computations, and moreover, it allows for fast numerical
simulations and generalizations to non Markovian noise. In detail we review the
depolarizing channel and the generalized amplitude damping channel in terms of
this noise gate formalism and show how these techniques can be applied to any

leads us to the derivation of general perturbation expansions for

the derivative of the characteristic Fredholm determinant may be efficiently

the multi-dimensional case.

$\mu$m passband on the Rayleigh-Jeans portion of the Planck function leads to a
maximum redshift estimate of $z\sim$4.5 since sources will not retain their
redshift independent brightness close to the peak of the Planck function and
thus drop out of surveys. Here we review evidence that ice absorption is
present in the spectra of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies which are often
taken as analogs for the 850 $\mu$m source population. We consider the
implication of this absorption for ice induced spectral structure at far
infrared wavelengths and present marginal astronomical evidence that amorphous
ice may have a feature similar to crystalline ice near 150 $\mu$m. Recent
corroborative laboratory evidence is supportive of this conclusion. It is
argued that early metal enrichment by pair instability SN may lead to a high
ice content relative to refractory dust at high redshift and a fairly robust
detection of ice emission in a $z=6.42$ quasar is presented. It is further
shown that ice emission is needed to understand the 450 $\mu$m sources observed
in the GOODS-N field. We are thus encouraged to apply far infrared ice emission
models to the available observations of HDF 850.1, the brightest submillimeter
source in the {\it Hubble Deep Field}. We suggest that a redshift as large as
13 may need to be considered for this source, nearly a factor of three above
the usual top estimate. Inclusion of the possibility of far infrared ice
emission in the spectral energy distributions of model sources generally
broadens the range of redshifts to be considered for submillimeter sources
compared to models without ice emission.

the strong impact of rotation induced mixing and mass loss at very low Z. The
strong mixing leads to a significant production of primary nitrogen 14, carbon
13 and neon 22. Mass loss during the red supergiant stage allows the production
of Wolf-Rayet stars, type Ib,c supernovae and possibly gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)

black hole X-ray binaries as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), it is
neccesary to use the global solution to the equations rather than the simpler
self-similar solution, since the latter is inaccurate in the region near the
black hole where most of the radiation is emitted. However, technically, it is
a difficult task to calculate the global solution because of the transonic
nature of the flow, which makes it a two-point boundary value problem. In this
paper we propose a simplified approach for calculating the global ADAF
solution. We replace the radial momentum equation by a simple algebraic
relation between the angular velocity of the gas and the Keplerian angular
velocity, while keeping all other equations unchanged. It is then easy to solve
the differential energy equations to obtain an approximate global solution. By
adjusting the free parameters, we find that for almost any accretion rate and
for $\alpha=0.1-0.3$ we can get good simplified global solutions. The predicted
spectra from the approximate solutions are very close to the spectra obtained
from the true global solutions.

measure of cosmological models, masses of dark-matter halos are poorly defined,
global, and unobservable quantities.
  Aims. We argue that local, observable quantities such as the X-ray
temperatures of galaxy clusters can be directly compared to theoretical
predictions without invoking masses. We derive the X-ray temperature function
directly from the statistics of Gaussian random fluctuations in the
gravitational potential.
  Methods. We derive the abundance of potential minima constrained by the
requirement that they belong to linearly collapsed structures. We then use the
spherical-collapse model to relate linear to non-linear perturbations, and the
virial theorem to convert potential depths to temperatures. No reference is
made to mass or other global quantities in the derivation.
  Results. Applying a proper high-pass filter that removes large enough modes
from the gravitational potential, we derive an X-ray temperature function that
agrees very well with the classical Press-Schechter approach on relevant
temperature scales, but avoids the necessity of measuring masses.
  Conclusions. TThis first study shows that and how an X-ray temperature
function of galaxy clusters can be analytically derived, avoiding the
introduction of poorly defined global quantities such as halo masses. This
approach will be useful for reducing scatter in observed cluster distributions
and thus in cosmological conclusions drawn from them.

obtained when the constituting rank-1 tensors are imposed to be themselves
symmetric. It is shown that rank and symmetric rank are equal in a number of
cases, and that they always exist in an algebraically closed field. We will
discuss the notion of the generic symmetric rank, which, due to the work of
Alexander and Hirschowitz, is now known for any values of dimension and order.

Based on a statistical analysis of the possible orbital solutions that fit the

0.33 (+0.09/-0.02) Msun for the primary and secondary, respectively, and a
distance to the system of 111 (+19/-18) pc. The distance measurement is
consistent with the close distance estimates of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.
Comparing our results with evolutionary tracks suggests an age of 3-4 Myr for

breaking of SU(3)xU(1) flavor symmetry into U(2)xZ_3 explains why one family is
much heavier than the others. On the other side, an explicit symmetry breaking
of SU(3) into a discrete flavor symmetry leads to the observed tribimaximal
mixing for the leptons. We write an explicit model where this discrete symmetry
group is A4. Naturalness of the charged fermion mass hierarchy appears as a
consequence of the continuous SU(3) flavor symmetry. Moreover, the same
discrete A4-GUT invariant operators are the root of the large lepton mixing,

describing basic features of some probability densities such as those which
asymptotically decay like {\it power laws}. They naturally appear in the study
of many complex dynamical systems, particularly those obeying nonextensive
statistical mechanics, a current generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory.
They recover standard mean values (or moments) for $q=1$. Here we discuss the
characterization of a (non-negative) probability density by a suitable set of
all its escort mean values together with the set of all associated normalizing
quantities, provided that all of them converge. This opens the door to a
natural extension of the well known characterization, for the $q=1$ instance,
of a distribution in terms of the standard moments, provided that {\it all} of
them have {\it finite} values. This question would be specially relevant in
connection with probability densities having {\it divergent} values for all
nonvanishing standard moments higher than a given one (e.g., probability
densities asymptotically decaying as power-laws), for which the standard
approach is not applicable. The Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, whose second and
higher even order moments diverge, constitutes a simple illustration of the
interest of this investigation. In this context, we also address some
mathematical subtleties with the aim of clarifying some aspects of an
interesting non-linear generalization of the Fourier Transform, namely, the

HD 189733b in the MIPS 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of the
planet's orbit as our previous observations in the IRAC 8 micron bandpass
(Knutson et al. 2007). We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from
the planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this corresponds
to minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-
48 K and 1220 +/- 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an
orbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30
degrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would
have enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the
small amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's
atmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night
side at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature
differences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for HD
189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a
fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two
wavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8
micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,
although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. If
these two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that the
temperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence that
the atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes. (abridged)

July 24-30 with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector and
the hard X-ray imager Super-AGILE sensitive in the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV,
respectively. Over the entire period, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from 3C
454.3 at a significance level of 13.8-$\sigma$ with an average flux (E$>$100
MeV) of $(280 \pm 40) \times 10^{-8}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The gamma-ray
flux appears to be variable towards the end of the observation. No emission was
detected by Super-AGILE in the energy range 20-60 keV, with a 3-$\sigma$ upper
limit of $2.3 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The gamma-ray flux
level of 3C 454.3 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected for this
quasar and among the most intense gamma-ray fluxes ever detected from Flat
Spectrum Radio Quasars.

(time-dependent) radiative transfer equation is solved by tracing individual
photon packets in an explicitly photon-conserving manner directly on the

directed transport of radiation despite the irregular spatial distribution of
the SPH particles, photons are guided inside cones. We present and test a
parallel numerical implementation of TRAPHIC in the SPH code GADGET-2,
specified for the transport of mono-chromatic hydrogen-ionizing radiation. The
results of the tests are in excellent agreement with both analytic solutions

computer science and complexity theory. Typically an input to these problems is
a family of sets over a finite universe and the goal is to cover the elements
of the universe with as few sets of the family as possible.
  The variations of covering problems include well known problems like Set
Cover, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set and Facility Location to name a few.
Recently there has been a lot of study on partial covering problems, a natural
generalization of covering problems. Here, the goal is not to cover all the
elements but to cover the specified number of elements with the minimum number
of sets.
  In this paper we study partial covering problems in graphs in the realm of
parameterized complexity. Classical (non-partial) version of all these problems
have been intensively studied in planar graphs and in graphs excluding a fixed
graph $H$ as a minor. However, the techniques developed for parameterized
version of non-partial covering problems cannot be applied directly to their
partial counterparts. The approach we use, to show that various partial
covering problems are fixed parameter tractable on planar graphs, graphs of
bounded local treewidth and graph excluding some graph as a minor, is quite
different from previously known techniques. The main idea behind our approach
is the concept of implicit branching. We find implicit branching technique to
be interesting on its own and believe that it can be used for some other
problems.

about 0.5 magnitude fainter than the turnover point of the GC luminosity
function. We find that NGC 3311 has a huge population of ~16, 000 GCs, closely
similar to the prototypical high specific frequency Virgo giant M87. The
color-magnitude distribution shows that the metal-poor blue GC sequence and the
metal-richer red sequence are both present, with nearly equal numbers of
clusters. Bimodal fits to the color distributions confirm that the blue
sequence shows the same trend of progressively increasing metallicity with GC
mass that has previously been found in many other large galaxies; the
correlation we find corresponds to a scaling of GC metallicity with mass of Z ~
M^0.6 . By contrast, the red sequence shows no change of mean metallicity with
mass, but it shows an upward extension to much higher than normal luminosity
into the UCD-like range, strengthening the potential connections between
massive GCs and UCDs. The GC luminosity function, which we measure down to the
turnover point at M_I = -8.4, also has a normal form like those in other giant
ellipticals. Within the Hydra field, another giant elliptical NGC 3309 is
sitting just 100"" from the cD NGC 3311. We use our data to solve simultaneously
for the spatial structure and total GC populations of both galaxies at once.
Their specific frequencies are S_N (NGC 3311) = 12.5 +/- 1.5 and S_N (NGC 3309)

only excludes solar-like magnetic activity as the origin of the X-Rays. Most
importantly, the X-Ray luminosity of Herbig AeBe stars have a different

range of our data while the other two objects exhibit significant excess
emission at >5um. We are able to reproduce the excess emission from each brown
dwarf using our models of irradiated accretion disks. According to our model
fits, both disks have experienced a high degree of dust settling. We also find
that silicate emission at 10 and 20um is absent from the spectra of these
disks, indicating that grains in the upper disk layers have grown to sizes
larger than ~5um. Both of these characteristics are consistent with previous
observations of decreasing silicate emission with lower stellar masses and
older ages. These trends suggest that either 1) the growth of dust grains, and
perhaps planetesimal formation, occurs faster in disks around brown dwarfs than
in disks around stars, or 2) the radii of the mid-IR-emitting regions of disks
are smaller for brown dwarfs than for stars, and grains grow faster at smaller
disk radii. Finally, we note the possible detection of an unexplained emission
feature near 14um in the spectra of both of the disk-bearing brown dwarfs.

has a large fraction of intermediate luminosity galaxies; or equivalently, a
luminosity function with a flatter faint end slope. The luminosity function for

merge. Evidence for the ongoing collapse of the group is provided by the
unusually large incidence of star formation activity in small galaxies with

  Enabling the LBV instability with feedback","ApJ, in press, v. 679","Astrophys.J.679:1467-1477,2008","10.1086/586885",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (abridged) We propose the new designation ``WNH'' for luminous Wolf-Rayet
(WR) stars of the nitrogen sequence with H in their spectra. These are commonly
called WNL stars (e.g., WN7h), but this new shorthand avoids confusion because
there are late-type WN stars without H and early-type WN stars with H. Clearly
differentiating WNH stars from H-free WN stars is critical when discussing
progenitors of Type Ib/c SNe and GRBs -- the massive WNH stars are not likely
SN progenitors, and are distinct from core-He burning WR stars. We show that
the masses of WNH stars are systematically higher than H-poor WR stars (both WN
and WC), with little overlap, while H mass fractions of luminous WNH stars
exceed those of LBVs. We favor the interpretation that the most luminous WNH
stars are still core-H burning, pre-LBVs. While on the main sequence, a star's
mass is reduced due to winds while its luminosity slowly rises, so the star
increases its Eddington factor and mass-loss rate, pushing it even closer to
the Eddington limit. With this feedback, observed masses and mass-loss rates of
WNH stars are a natural outcome near the end of core-H burning. Feedback from
the strong WNH wind itself then enables the instability seen later as an LBV.
Steadily climbing mass-loss rates also explain continuity in spectral traits
from O3 V to O3 If* to WNH.

more energy in visual light than any other known SN. Two hypotheses to explain
its high luminosity -- that it was powered by shock interaction with CSM as
implied by its Type IIn spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decay
from a large mass of 56Ni synthesized in a pair-instability SN -- predicted
different late-time properties. Here we present observations of SN2006gy
obtained more than a year after discovery. We were unable to detect it at
visual wavelengths, but clear near-IR K and H-band detections show that it is
still at least as luminous as the peak of a normal SN II. We also present
spectra giving an upper limit to the late-time Ha luminosity of about 1e39
erg/s. Based on the weak late-time Ha, X-ray, and radio emission, combined with
the difficulty of explaining the shift to IR wavelengths, we can rule out
ongoing CSM interaction as the primary late-time power source. Instead, we
propose that the evolution of SN2006gy is consistent with one of two possible
scenarios: (1) A pair-instability SN plus modest CSM interaction, where the
radioactive decay luminosity shifts to the IR because of dust formation. (2) An
IR echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existing
dust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to have
ejected another 10 Msun shell about 1500 yr before the SN.

environment within a few 10$^2$ AU of Type IIn supernovae require very high
progenitor mass-loss rates. Those rates are so high that the only known stars

explosive or episodic mass loss (a.k.a. LBV eruptions like the 19th century

proposed on phenomenological grounds is given in form of a differential delay
equation. The normal form exhibits a symmetry preserving Hopf bifurcation which
may coalesce with a saddle-node in a Bogdanov-Takens point, and a symmetry
breaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation. We study here the Hopf
bifurcation for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a
center manifold reduction, and for a wave train by means of a multiscale
analysis leading to a real Ginzburg-Landau equation as the corresponding
amplitude equation. Both, the center manifold reduction and the multiscale
analysis show that the Hopf bifurcation is always subcritical independent of
the parameters. This may have links to cardiac alternans which have so far been
believed to be stable oscillations emanating from a supercritical bifurcation.
We discuss the implications for cardiac alternans and revisit the instability
in some excitable media where the oscillations had been believed to be stable.
In particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the Hopf bifurcation
coincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans.

networks that employ linear network coding. The algorithm has the feature that
the encoding process is truly online, as opposed to a block-by-block approach.
The setup assumes a packet erasure broadcast channel with stochastic arrivals
and full feedback, but the proposed scheme is potentially applicable to more
general lossy networks with link-by-link feedback. The algorithm guarantees
that the physical queue size at the sender tracks the backlog in degrees of
freedom (also called the virtual queue size). The new notion of a node ""seeing""
a packet is introduced. In terms of this idea, our algorithm may be viewed as a
natural extension of ARQ schemes to coded networks. Our approach, known as the
drop-when-seen algorithm, is compared with a baseline queuing approach called
drop-when-decoded. It is shown that the expected queue size for our approach is
$O(\frac1{1-\rho})$ as opposed to $\Omega(\frac1{(1-\rho)^2})$ for the baseline
approach, where $\rho$ is the load factor.

number of the tongues changes with time on the inner-disk dynamical timescale.
In contrast with funnel flows, which deposit matter mainly in the polar region,
the tongues deposit matter much closer to the stellar equator. The instability
appears for relatively small misalignment angles, $\Theta\lesssim30^\circ$,
between the star's rotation and magnetic axes, and is associated with higher
accretion rates. The hot spots and light curves during accretion through

filtergrams together with magnetograms and dopplergrams were taken for a plage
region covered by abnormal granules as well as ubiquitous G-band bright points,
using the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) under very good seeing conditions.
High magnetic flux density regions are not necessarily associated with G-band
bright points. We refer to the observed extended areas with high magnetic flux
density as magnetic islands to separate them from magnetic elements. We
discover that G-band bright points tend to be located near the boundary of such
magnetic islands. The concentration of G-band bright points decreases with
inward distance from the boundary of the magnetic islands. Moreover, G-band
bright points are preferentially located where magnetic flux density is higher,
given the same distance from the boundary. There are some bright points located
far inside the magnetic islands. Such bright points have higher minimum
magnetic flux density at the larger inward distance from the boundary.
Convective velocity is apparently reduced for such high magnetic flux density
regions regardless of whether they are populated by G-band bright points or
not. The magnetic islands are surrounded by downflows.These results suggest
that high magnetic flux density, as well as efficient heat transport from the
sides or beneath, are required to make magnetic elements bright in G-band.

transition of ortho-H2D+ was observed with APEX towards the density peak of Oph
D. The width of the H2D+ line indicates that the kinetic temperature in the
core is about 6 K. So far, this is the most direct evidence of such cold gas in
molecular clouds. The observed H2D+ spectrum can be reproduced with a
hydrostatic model with the temperature increasing from about 6 K in the centre
to almost 10 K at the surface. The model is unstable against any increase in
the external pressure, and the core is likely to form a low-mass star. The
results suggest that an equilibrium configuration is a feasible intermediate
stage of star formation even if the larger scale structure of the cloud is
thought to be determined by turbulent fragmentation. In comparison with the
isothermal case, the inward decrease in the temperature makes smaller, i.e.
less massive, cores susceptible to externally triggered collapse.

inferred by Milne-Eddington inversion. The observations reveal widespread
occurrence of transient, spatially isolated horizontal magnetic fields. The
lateral extent of the horizontal magnetic fields is comparable to the size of
photospheric granules. These horizontal magnetic fields seem to be tossed about
by upflows and downflows of the granular convection. We also report an event
that appears to be driven by the magnetic buoyancy instability. We refer to
buoyancy-driven emergence as type1 and convection-driven emergence as type2.
Although both events have magnetic field strengths of about 600 G, the filling

crucial role in shaping the Solar System. The knowledge of its internal
structure would strongly constrain the solar system formation mechanism.
Seismology is the most efficient way to probe directly the internal structure
of giant planets. Aims. SYMPA is the first instrument dedicated to the
observations of free oscillations of Jupiter. Principles and theoretical
performance have been presented in paper I. This second paper describes the
data processing method, the real instrumental performance and presents the
first results of a Jovian observation run, lead in 2005 at Teide Observatory.
Methods. SYMPA is a Fourier transform spectrometer which works at fixed optical
path difference. It produces Doppler shift maps of the observed object.
Velocity amplitude of Jupiter's oscillations is expected below 60 cm/s. Results
Despite light technical defects, the instrument demonstrated to work correctly,
being limited only by photon noise, after a careful analysis. A noise level of
about 12 cm/s has been reached on a 10-night observation run, with 21 % duty
cycle, which is 5 time better than previous similar observations. However, no
signal from Jupiter is clearly highlighted.

depends critically on the metallicity. It has therefore been suggested that
beta Cep and SPB stars should be rare in the Magellanic Clouds which have lower
metallicities than the solar neighborhood. To test this prediction we have
observed the open SMC cluster NGC 371 for 12 nights in order to search for beta
Cep and SPB stars. Surprisingly, we find 29 short-period B-type variables in
the upper part of the main sequence, many of which are probably SPB stars. This
result indicates that pulsation is still driven by the kappa mechanism even in
low metallicity environments. All the identified variables have periods longer
than the fundamental radial period which means that they cannot be beta Cep
stars. Within an amplitude detection limit of 5 mmag no stars in the top of the
HR-diagram show variability with periods shorter than the fundamental radial
period. So if beta Cep stars are present in the cluster they oscillate with
amplitudes below 5 mmag, which is significantly lower than the mean amplitude
of beta Cep stars in the Galaxy. We see evidence that multimode pulsation is
more common in the upper part of the main sequence than in the lower. We have
also identified 5 eclipsing binaries and 3 periodic pulsating Be stars in the
cluster field.

mass (central pressure), are metastable to the conversion to quark stars
(hybrid or strange stars). In this paper, we present a systematic study of the
metastability of pure hadronic compact stars using different relativistic
models for the equation of state (EoS). In particular, we compare results for
the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model with those for the Glendenning--Moszkowski
parametrization of the non-linear Walecka model (NLWM). For QMC model, we find
large values ($M_{cr} = 1.6$ -- $1.9 M_\odot$) for the critical mass of the
hadronic star sequence and we find that the formation of a quark star is only
possible with a soft quark matter EoS. For the Glendenning--Moszkowski
parametrization of the NLWM, we explore the effect of different hyperon
couplings on the critical mass and on the stellar conversion energy. We find
that increasing the value of the hyperon coupling constants shifts the bulk
transition point for quark deconfinement to higher densities, increases the
stellar metastability threshold mass and the value of the critical mass, and
thus makes the formation of quark stars less likely. For the largest values of
the hyperon couplings we find a critical mass which may be as high as 1.9 - 2.1
$M_\odot$. These stellar configurations, which contain a large central hyperon
fraction ($f_{Y,cr} \sim 30 %$), would be able to describe highly-massive
compact stars, such as the one associated to the millisecond pulsars PSR

due to s-d scattering. Curiously, below 120K MR is positive, while at still
lower temperatures in the martensitic phase, MR is negative again. The positive
MR cannot be explained by Lorentz contribution and is related to a magnetic
transition. Evidence for this is obtained from ab initio density functional
theory, a decrease in magnetization and resistivity upturn at 120 K. Theory
shows that a ferrimagnetic state with anti-ferromagnetic alignment between the
local magnetic moments of the Mn atoms is the energetically favoured ground
state. In the martensitic phase, there are two competing factors that govern
the MR behavior: a dominant negative trend up to the saturation field due to
the decrease of electron scattering at twin and domain boundaries; and a weaker
positive trend due to the ferrimagnetic nature of the magnetic state. MR
exhibits a hysteresis between heating and cooling that is related to the first
order nature of the martensitic phase transition.

perturbations is followed in cosmological $N$-body simulations. We first run a

deviations are caused by {\it nonlinear} coupling with a small number of modes
at largest scales owing to finiteness of the simulation volume. We then develop
an analytic model based on second-order perturbation theory to quantify the
effect. Our model accurately reproduces the simulation results. For a single
realization, the second-order effect appears typically as ``zig-zag'' patterns
around the linear-theory prediction, which imprints artificial ``oscillations''
that lie on the real baryon-acoustic oscillations. Although an ensemble average
of a number of realizations approaches the linear theory prediction, the
dispersions of the realizations remain large even for a large simulation volume
of several hundred megaparsecs on a side. For the standard $\Lambda$CDM model,
the deviations from linear growth rate are as large as 10 percent for a
simulation volume with $L = 500h^{-1}$Mpc and for a bin width in wavenumber of
$\Delta k = 0.005h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which are comparable to the intrinsic variance
of Gaussian random realizations. We find that the dispersions scales as
$\propto L^{-3/2} \Delta k^{-1/2}$ and that the mean dispersion amplitude can
be made smaller than a percent only if we use a very large volume of $L >
2h^{-1}$Gpc. The finite box size effect needs to be appropriately taken into
account when interpreting results from large-scale structure simulations for
future dark energy surveys using baryon acoustic oscillations.

chemical composition and (iv) their thermal contribution to the planet
evolution. Our models, which include a gaseous H/He envelope, are compared with
models of solid, gasless Earth-like planets in order to examine the impact of a
gaseous envelope on the cooling and the resulting radius. We find that for a
fraction of heavy material larger than 20% of the planet mass, the distribution
of the heavy elements in the planet's interior affects substantially the
evolution and thus the radius at a given age. For planets with large core mass
fractions ($\simgr$ 50%), such as the Neptune-mass transiting planet GJ436b,
the contribution of the gravitational and thermal energy from the core to the
planet cooling history is not negligible, yielding a $\sim$ 10% effect on the
radius after 1 Gyr. We show that the present mass and radius determinations of
the massive planet Hat-P-2b require at least 200 $\mearth$ of heavy material in

gravity and in contrast with the Taub-NUT solutions of Einstein gravity, the
metric function depends on the specific form of the base factors on which one
constructs the circle fibration. Thus, one may say that the independence of the
NUT solutions on the geometry of the base space is not a robust feature of all
generally covariant theories of gravity and is peculiar to Einstein gravity. We
find that when Einstein gravity admits non-extremal NUT solutions with no
curvature singularity at $r=N$, then there exists a non-extremal NUT solution
in third order Lovelock gravity. In 8-dimensional spacetime, this happens when
the metric of the base space is chosen to be $\Bbb{CP}^{3}$. Indeed, third
order Lovelock gravity does not admit non-extreme NUT solutions with any other
base space. This is another property which is peculiar to Einstein gravity. We
also find that the third order Lovelock gravity admits extremal NUT solution
when the base space is $T^{2}\times T^{2}\times T^{2}$ or $S^{2}\times
T^{2}\times T^{2}$. We have extended these observations to two conjectures

({\boldmath$\rm\Omega$}), the inclination of the rotation vector ($\theta$) and
the relative stability ($S$) of the upper stable layer. The computational
domain is a rectangular box in an f-plane configuration and is divided into two
regions of unstable and stable stratification with the stable layer placed
above the convectively unstable layer. Several models have been computed and
the penetration distance into the stable layer above the convection zone is
estimated by determining the position where time averaged kinetic energy flux
has the first zero in the upper stable layer. The vertical grid spacing in all
the model is non-uniform, and is less in the upper region so that the flows are
better resolved in the region of interest. We find that the penetration
distance increases as the rotation rate increases for the case when the
rotation vector is aligned with the vertical axis. However, with the increase
in the stability of the upper stable layer, the upward penetration distance
decreases. Since we are not able to afford computations with finer resolution

planets like Earth and life in the universe, is quickly gaining momentum. In
the future, large space observatories could directly detect the light scattered
from rocky planets, but they would not be able to spatially resolve a planet's
surface. Using reflectance models and real cloud data from satellite
observations, here we show that, despite Earth's dynamic weather patterns, the
light scattered by the Earth to a hypothetical distant observer as a function
of time contains sufficient information to accurately measure Earth's rotation
period. This is because ocean currents and continents result in relatively
stable averaged global cloud patterns. The accuracy of these measurements will
vary with the viewing geometry and other observational constraints. If the
rotation period can be measured with accuracy, data spanning several months
could be coherently combined to obtain spectroscopic information about
individual regions of the planetary surface. Moreover, deviations from a
periodic signal can be used to infer the presence of relatively short-live
structures in its atmosphere (i.e., clouds). This could provide a useful
technique for recognizing exoplanets that have active weather systems, changing
on a timescale comparable to their rotation. Such variability is likely to be
related to the atmospheric temperature and pressure being near a phase
transition and could support the possibility of liquid water on the planet's
surface.

NGC1600 has been undertaken. Although this galaxy is often classified as a
member of a loose group, all the neighbouring galaxies are much fainter and
could be taken as satellites of NGC1600. The number density profile of galaxies
in the field of this galaxy shows a decline with radius, with evidence of a
background at approximately 1.3 Mpc. The density and number density profile are
consistent with that found for other isolated early-type galaxies. NGC1600
appears as an extended source in X-rays, and the center of the X-ray emission
seems not to coincide with the center of the galaxy. The velocity distribution
of neighbouring galaxies has been measured from optical spectroscopic
observations and shows that the mean radial velocity is approximately 85 km/s
less than that of NGC1600, indicating that the centre of mass could lie outside
the galaxy. The velocity dispersion of the `group' is estimated at 429 km/s.
The inferred mass of the system is therefore of the order of 10^14 solar
masses, a value that corresponds to a large group. NGC1600 therefore shares
some similarities, but is not identical to, the `fossil clusters' detected in
X-ray surveys. Implications of this result for studies of isolated early-type

cosmological simulations which follows a concordance LambdaCDM cosmology. By
means of a detailed chemical evolution model for the solar vicinity, we study
the effects of the different gas infall laws on the abundance patterns and the
G-dwarf metallicity distribution. The cosmological gas infall law predicts two
main gas accretion episodes. By means of this cosmologically motivated infall

non-$D\bar D$ decays of the $\psi(3770)$, a $1^{3}D_{1}$-dominated charmonium,
we calculate the annihilation decay of $\psi(3770)$ in NRQCD. By introducing
the color-octet contributions, the results are free from infrared divergences.
The color-octet matrix elements are estimated by solving the evolution
equations. The S-D mixing effect is found to be very small. With
$m_{c}=1.5\pm0.1\textrm{GeV}$ our result is $\Gamma(\psi(3770)\to \textrm{light
hadrons})=467^{-187}_{+338}\textrm{KeV}$. For $m_c=1.4$ GeV, together with the
observed hadronic transitions and E1 transitions, the non-$D\bar D$ decay
branching ratio of $\psi(3770)$ could reach about 5%. Our results do not favor
either of the results of BES and CLEO collaborations, and further experimental
tests are urged.

Volterra-type equations. We show that the ABS equations correspond to
B\""acklund transformations for some particular cases of the discrete
Krichever-Novikov equation found by Yamilov (YdKN equation). This enables us to
construct new generalized symmetries for the ABS equations. The same can be
said about the generalizations of the ABS equations introduced by Tongas,
Tsoubelis and Xenitidis. All of them generate B\""acklund transformations for
the YdKN equation. The higher order generalized symmetries we construct in the
present paper confirm their integrability.

linear channels of 12 nm diameter and 200 micrometer length in a single
crystalline silicon membrane reveal a Knudsen diffusion type transport from
10^2 to 10^7 in Knudsen number Kn. The classic scaling prediction for the
transport diffusion coefficient on temperature and mass of diffusing
species,D_He ~ sqrt(T), is confirmed over a T range from 40 K to 300 K for He
and for the ratio of D_He/D_Ar ~ sqrt(m_Ar/m_He). Deviations of the channels
from a cylindrical form, resolved with transmission electron microscopy down to
subnanometer scales, quantitatively account for a reduced diffusivity as
compared to Knudsen diffusion in ideal tubular channels. The membrane
permeation experiments are described over 10 orders of magnitude in Kn,
encompassing the transition flow regime, by the unified flow model of Beskok
and Karniadakis.

with a review of classical results such as the Reeh--Schlieder Theorem and its
immediate and controversial consequences, more recent results are discussed.
These include the nature of vacuum correlations and the degree of entanglement
of the vacuum, as well as the striking fact that the modular objects determined
by the vacuum state and algebras of observables localized in certain regions of
Minkowski space encode a remarkable range of physical information, from the
dynamics and scattering behavior of the theory to the external symmetries and
even the space--time itself. These modular objects also provide an intrinsic
characterization of the vacuum state itself, a fact which is of particular
relevance to the search for criteria to select physically significant reference
states for quantum field theories on curved space--times.
