with the redshifted 21 cm line as a cosmological probe, as it has been argued
to have a greater long-term potential than the cosmic microwave background.
However, its utility depends on many assumptions. To aid experimental planning
and design, we quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters
can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We cover assumptions
related to modeling of the ionization power spectrum and associated
nonlinearity, experimental specifications like array layout and noise,
cosmological assumptions about reionization history and inter-galactic medium
(IGM) evolution, and assumptions about astrophysical foregrounds. We derive
simple analytic approximations for how various assumptions affect the results,
and find that ionization power modeling is most important, followed by array
layout (crudely, the more compact, the better). We also present an accurate yet
robust method for measuring cosmological parameters in practice, separating the
physics from the astrophysics by exploiting both gravitationally induced
clustering anisotropy and the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather
smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters.
For example, a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography
could improve the sensitivity of the Planck CMB satellite to spatial curvature
and neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002
and Delta m_nu ~ 0.007 eV, and give a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index
running predicted by the simpliest inflation models.

viral capsid is modeled as a hollowed sphere. The attraction between RNA
molecules and the inner viral capsid is assumed to be non-specific and occurs
at the inner capsid surface only. For small capsid attraction, it is found that
monomer concentration of RNA molecules is maximum at the center of the capsid
to maximize their configurational entropy. For stronger capsid attraction, RNA
concentration peaks at some distance near the capsid. In the latter case, the
competition between the branching of RNA secondary struture and its adsorption
to the inner capsid results in the formation of a dense layer of RNA near
capsid surface. The layer thickness is a slowly varying (logarithmic) function
of the capsid inner radius. Consequently, for immediate strength of RNA-capsid
interaction, the amount of RNA packaged inside a virus is proportional to the
capsid {\em area} (or the number of proteins) instead of its volume. The
numerical profiles describe reasonably well the experimentally observed RNA
nucleotide concentration profiles of various viruses.

of magnetic diffusion in which the helicity of the mean magnetic field is

parameter of the mean magnetic field. A simple model of an active region

connections between the nuclear and host properties of QSOs, using
high-resolution images and removing the central point source to reveal the host
structure. We confirm that more luminous QSO nuclei are found in more luminous
host galaxies. Using central black hole masses from the literature, we find
that nuclear luminosity also generally increases with black hole mass, but it
is not tightly correlated. Nuclear luminosities range from 2.3% to 200% of the
Eddington limit. Those in elliptical hosts cover the range fairly evenly, while
those in spirals are clustered near the Eddington limit. Using a principal
components analysis, we find a kind of fundamental plane relating the nuclear
luminosity to the size and effective surface magnitude of the bulge. Using
optical nuclear luminosity, this relationship explains 96.1% of the variance in
the overall sample, while another version of the relationship uses x-ray
nuclear luminosity and explains 95.2% of the variance. The form of this QSO
fundamental plane shows similarities to the well-studied fundamental plane of
elliptical galaxies, and we examine the possible relationship between them as

of the sources are unresolved, with K-band polarizations, P_K < 6 per cent.
Several objects are associated with extended reflection nebulae. These objects
have centrosymmetric vector patterns with polarization discs over their cores;
maximum polarizations of P_K > 20 per cent are seen over their envelopes.
Correlations are observed between the degree of core polarization and the
evolutionary status inferred from the spectral energy distribution. K-band core
polarizations >6 per cent are only observed in Class I YSOs. A 3D Monte Carlo
model with oblate grains aligned with a magnetic field is used to investigate
the flux distributions and polarization structures of three of the rho Oph YSOs
with extended nebulae. A rho proportional to r^(-1.5) power law for the density
is applied throughout the envelopes. The large-scale centrosymmetric
polarization structures are due to scattering. However, the polarization
structure in the bright core of the nebula appears to require dichroic
extinction by aligned non-spherical dust grains. The position angle indicates a
toroidal magnetic field in the inner part of the envelope. Since the measured
polarizations attributed to dichroic extinction are usually <10 per cent, the
grains must either be nearly spherical or very weakly aligned. The higher
polarizations observed in the outer parts of the reflection nebulae require
that the dust grains responsible for scattering have maximum grain sizes <=1.05
microns.

onset of star formation that occurs when the central cooling time of the hot
atmosphere falls below ~ 5x10^8 yr, or equivalently when the central entropy
falls below ~ 30 keV cm^2. In addition to this criterion, star formation in
cooling flows also appears to require that the X-ray and galaxy centroids lie
within ~ 20 kpc of each other, and that the jet (cavity) power is smaller than
the X-ray cooling luminosity. These three criteria, together with the high
ratio of cooling time to AGN outburst (cavity) age across our sample, directly
link the presence of star formation and AGN activity in CDGs to cooling
instabilities in the intracluster plasma. Our results provide compelling
evidence that AGN feedback into the hot ICM is largely responsible for
regulating cooling and star formation in the cores of clusters, leading to the
significant growth of supermassive black holes in CDGs at late times.

  Methods. We use a multi-scale spectral mapping algorithm especially designed
to map spectroscopic observables from X-ray extended emission of the ICM.
Derived from a former algorithm using Haar wavelets, our algorithm is now
implemented with B-spline wavelets in order to perform a more regular analysis
of the signal.
  Results. For the four clusters in our sample that are major mergers, we find
a complex thermal structure with strong thermal variations consistent with
their dynamics. For two of them, A2065 and A2256, we perform a 3-d analysis of
cold front features evidenced from the gas temperature and brightness maps.
Furthermore, we detect a significant non-radial thermal structure outside the
cool core region of the other 3 more ""regular"" clusters, with relative
amplitudes of about about 10%. We investigate possible implications of this
structure on the mass estimates of the ""regular"" clusters A1795 and A2029, by
extracting surface brightness and temperature profiles from sectors
correspondings to the hottest and coldest regions in the maps. While
compensating with surface brightness for A2029, leading to consistent mass
profiles, the temperature structure leads to significant mass discrepancies in
the innermost region of A1795.

The offered AB-Net joins an incoming projectile to a small braking parachute
and this incoming projectile loses speed by air braking after a drag distance
of 50 - 150 meters. A following interception net after the first may serve to
collect the slowed projectiles and their fragments or bomblets so that they do
not reach the aimpoint. The author offers the design of AB-Net, a developed
theory of snagging with a small braking parachute by AB-Net; and sample

Qassam), net to counter artillery projectile (caliber 76 mm), net to counter
bullets (caliber 7.6 mm).

can have in two crucial questions of Cosmology, concerning particular moments
of its evolution for very large and for low-curvature regimes, that is for very
condensed phase and at the present period of acceleration. We present here a
toy model of a complete cosmological scenario in which the main factor
responsible for the geometry is a nonlinear magnetic field which produces a FRW
homogeneous and isotropic geometry. In this scenario we distinguish four
distinct phases: a bouncing period, a radiation era, an acceleration era and a
re-bouncing. It has already been shown that in NLED a strong magnetic field can
overcome the inevitability of a singular region typical of linear Maxwell
theory; on the other extreme situation, that is for very weak magnetic field it
can accelerate the expansion. The present model goes one step further: after
the acceleration phase the universe re-bounces and enter in a collapse era.
This behavior is a manifestation of the invariance under the dual map of the
scale factor $ a(t) \to 1/ a(t),$ a consequence of the corresponding inverse
symmetry of the electromagnetic field ($ F \to 1/ F,$ where $F \equiv
F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$) of the NLED theory presented here. Such sequence
collapse-bouncing-expansion-acceleration-re-bouncing-collapse constitutes a
basic unitary element for the structure of the universe that can be repeated
indefinitely yielding what we call a Cyclic Magnetic Universe.

signatures of jet rotation from young embedded sources.High resolution
long-slit spectroscopy of the H2 1-0 S(1) transition was obtained using
VLT/ISAAC, position-velocity (PV) diagrams constructed and intensity-weighted
radial velocities transverse to the jet flow measured. Mean intensity-weighted
velocities vary between vLSR ~ -90 and -65 km/s for HH 26, and -60 and -10 km/s
for HH 72; maxima occur close to the intensity peak and decrease toward the jet
borders. Velocity dispersions are ~ 45 and ~ 80 km/s for HH 26 and HH 72,
respectively, with gas motions as fast as -100 km/s present. Asymmetric PV
diagrams are seen for both objects which a simple empirical model of a
cylindrical jet section shows could in principle be reproduced by jet rotation
alone. Assuming magneto-centrifugal launching, the observed HH 26 flow may
originate at a disk radius of 2-4 AU from the star with the toroidal component
of the magnetic field dominant at the observed location, in agreement with
magnetic collimation models. We estimate that the kinetic angular momentum
transported by the HH 26 jet is ~ 2E5 M_sun/yr AU km/s. This value (a lower
limit to the total angular momentum transported by the flow) already amounts to
70% of the angular momentum that has to be extracted from the disk for the
accretion to proceed at the observed rate.
  The results of this pilot study suggest that jet rotation may also be present
at early evolutionary phases and supports the hypothesis that they carry away
excess angular momentum, thus allowing the central protostar to increase its

  We study the separable field equations obeyed by the various Newman-Penrose

asymptotic behaviour of the radial and angular solutions. We correct and build
on a study by Breuer, Ryan and Waller to find a uniformly valid asymptotic

  We follow Candelas, Chrzanowski and Howard (CCH) in their canonical
quantization of the electromagnetic potential and field. We perform an
asymptotic analysis of the form of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET)

leading order behaviour close to the horizon corresponds to minus the stress
tensor of a thermal distribution at the Hawking temperature rigidly rotating
with the horizon. We prove that expressions in CCH for the expectation value of
the stress tensor in the past Boulware, past Unruh and |CCH> states lead to a
lack of symmetry of the RSET under parity, even though this is a symmetry of

slow-fading links and single-antenna half-duplex relays. We identify two
families of networks that are multi-hop generalizations of the well-studied
two-hop network: K-Parallel-Path (KPP) networks and layered networks. KPP
networks can be viewed as the union of K node-disjoint parallel relaying paths,
each of length greater than one. KPP networks are then generalized to KPP(I)
networks, which permit interference between paths and to KPP(D) networks, which
possess a direct link from source to sink. We characterize the DMT of these
families of networks completely for K > 3. Layered networks are networks
comprising of relaying layers with edges existing only within the same layer or
between adjacent layers. We prove that a linear DMT between the maximum
diversity d_{max} and the maximum multiplexing gain of 1 is achievable for
fully-connected layered networks. This is shown to be equal to the optimal DMT
if the number of layers is less than 4. For multi-antenna KPP and layered
networks, we provide an achievable DMT region.
  For arbitrary ss-ss single-antenna directed-acyclic full-duplex networks, we
prove that a linear tradeoff between maximum diversity and maximum multiplexing

amplify and forward (AF) relaying. We also construct codes with short
block-lengths based on cyclic division algebras that achieve the optimal DMT
for all the proposed schemes. Two key implications of the results in the paper

emission templates fitted to infrared excess data at 3.6-170 mu. The code
involves two passes through the data, to try to optimize recognition of AGN
dust tori. A few carefully justified priors are used and are the key to
supression of outliers. Extinction, A_V, is allowed as a free parameter. We use
a set of 5982 spectroscopic redshifts, taken from the literature and from our
own spectroscopic surveys, to analyze the performance of our method as a
function of the number of photometric bands used in the solution and the
reduced chi^2. For 7 photometric bands the rms value of
(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec}) is 3.5%, and the percentage of catastrophic
outliers is ~1%.
  We discuss the redshift distributions at 3.6 and 24 mu. In individual fields,
structure in the redshift distribution corresponds to clusters which can be
seen in the spectroscopic redshift distribution. 10% of sources in the SWIRE
photometric redshift catalogue have z >2, and 4% have z>3, so this catalogue is
a huge resource for high redshift galaxies.
  A key parameter for understanding the evolutionary status of infrared
galaxies is L_{ir}/L_{opt}, which can be interpreted as the specific
star-formation rate for starbursts. For dust tori around Type 1 AGN,
L_{tor}/L_{opt} is a measure of the torus covering factor and we deduce a mean
covering factor of 40%.

kinds of distributed heating: Compton-heating due to hard X-rays from the
nucleus and local starlight heating. We find numerical solutions to the
axisymmetric hydrostatic equilibrium, energy balance, and photon diffusion
equations including these effects. Within the regime of typical parameters, the
two different sources of additional heating have very similar effects: the
density profile within the torus becomes shallower both radially and
vertically, but for plausible heating rates, there is only minor change
(relative to the source-free case) in the distribution of column density with
solid angle. The most interesting consequence of distributed heating is that it
selects out a relatively narrow range of parameters permitting an equilibrium,
particularly $(L/L_E)/\tau_T$. We discuss the implications of both the
narrowness of the permitted range and its approximate coincidence with the
range inferred from observations.

precise projection to the superior colliculus of the midbrain. This implies
that axons of neighboring retinal ganglion cells project to the proximal
locations in the target. The precision of topographic projection is a result of
combined effects of molecular labels, such as Eph receptors and ephrins, and
correlated electric activity. In the Isl2/EphA3 mutant mice the expression
levels of molecular labels is changed. As a result the topographic projection
is rewired so that the neighborhood relationships between retinal cell axons
are disrupted. Here we argue that the effects of correlated activity presenting
themselves in the form of Hebbian learning rules can facilitate the restoration
of the topographic connectivity even when the molecular labels carry
conflicting instructions. This occurs because the correlations in electric
activity carry information about retinal cells' spatial location that is
independent on molecular labels. We argue therefore that experiments in
Isl2/EphA3 knock-in mice directly test the interaction between effects of
molecular labels and correlated activity during the development of neural

evidence that the ability to use visual information for postural control during

linked to the two main parameters of the accretion process, namely the mass of
the black hole and the accretion rate. We assume: i) that the jet kinetic power
is proportional to the mass accretion rate; ii) that most of the jet
dissipation takes place at a distance proportional to the black hole mass; iii)
that the broad line region exists only above a critical value of the disk
luminosity, in Eddington units, and iv) that the radius of the broad line
region scales as the square root of the ionising disk luminosity. These
assumptions, motivated by existing observations or by reasonable theoretical
considerations, are sufficient to uniquely determine the SED of all blazars.
This framework accounts for the existence of ""blue quasars"", i.e. objects with
broad emission lines but with SEDs resembling those of low luminosity high
energy peaked BL Lac objects, as well as the existence of relatively low
luminosity ""red"" quasars. Implications on the possible evolution of blazars are
briefly discussed. This scenario can be tested quite easily once the AGILE and
especially the GLAST satellite observations, coupled with information in the
optical/X-ray band from Swift, will allow the knowledge of the entire SED of

detected 653 clusters of which 393 are located outside the central 450 pc in
the post-starburst disk of M82. The luminosity function of the detected
clusters show an apparent turnover at B=22 mag (M_B=-5.8), which we interpret
from Monte Carlo simulations as due to incompleteness in the detection of faint
clusters, rather than an intrinsic log-normal distribution. We derived a
photometric mass of every detected cluster from models of simple stellar
populations assuming a mean age of either an 8 (nuclear clusters) or 100 (disk
clusters) million years old. The mass functions of the disk (older) and the
nuclear (younger) clusters follow power-laws, the former being marginally
flatter (alpha=1.5+/-0.1) than the latter (alpha=1.8+/-0.1). The distribution
of sizes (Full Width at Half Maximum) of clusters brighter than the apparent
turn-over magnitude (mass>2E+4 Mo) can be described by a log-normal function.
This function peaks at 10 pc for clusters more massive than 1E+5 Mo, whereas
for lower masses, the peak is marginally shifted to larger values for the
younger, and smaller values for the older clusters. The observed trend towards
flattening of the mass function with age, together with an over-abundance of
older compact clusters, imply that cluster disruption in M82 is both dependent
on the mass and size of the clusters.

scattering (RCS) to the X-ray data of ten magnetars, including canonical and
transient anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). In
this scenario, non-thermal magnetar spectra in the soft X-rays (i.e. below ~10
keV) result from resonant cyclotron scattering of the thermal surface emission
by hot magnetospheric plasma. We find that this model can successfully account
for the soft X-ray emission of magnetars, while using the same number of free
parameters than the commonly used empirical blackbody plus power-law model.
However, while the RCS model can alone reproduce the soft X-ray spectra of
AXPs, the much harder spectra of SGRs below ~10 keV, requires the addition of a
power-law component (the latter being the same component responsible for their
hard X-ray emission). Although this model in its present form does not explain
the hard X-ray emission of a few of these sources, we took this further
component into account in our modeling not to overlook their contribution in
the ~4-10 keV band. We find that the entire class of sources is characterized
by magnetospheric plasma with a density which, at resonant radius, is about 3
orders of magnitudes higher than n_{GJ}, the Goldreich-Julian electron density.
The inferred values of the intervening hydrogen column densities, are also in
better agreement with more recent estimates inferred from the fit of single
X-ray edges. For the entire sample of observations, we find indications for a
correlation between the scattering depth and the electron thermal velocity, and
the field strength. Moreover, in most transient anomalous X-ray pulsars the

information about various stages of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In
particular, these stars allow us to study the formation and evolution of the
elements and the involved nucleosynthesis processes. This knowledge is
invaluable for our understanding of the cosmic chemical evolution and the onset
of star- and galaxy formation. Metal-poor stars are the local equivalent of the
high-redshift Universe, and offer crucial observational constraints on the
nature of the first stars. This review presents the history of the first
discoveries of metal-poor stars that laid the foundation to this field.
Observed abundance trends at the lowest metallicities are described, as well as
particular classes of metal-poor stars such as r-process and C-rich stars.
Scenarios on the origins of the abundances of metal-poor stars and the
application of large samples of metal-poor stars to cosmological questions are
discussed.

strength. The top of the flow is always directed outward--away from the umbra--
because of the broken symmetry due to the inclined magnetic field. Upflows
occur in the inner parts of the gaps and most of the gas turns over radially
(outwards and sideways), and descends back down again. The ascending, cooling
and overturning flow tends to bend magnetic field lines down, forcing a
weakening of the field that makes it easier for gas located in an adjacent

heating, thus causing the inward propagation of the filament.

medium with low metallicity. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is ideally suited
to study star formation in such an environment. The physical and chemical state
of the ISM in a star forming environment can be constrained by observations of
submm and FIR spectral lines of the main carbon carrying species, CO, CI and
CII, which originate in the surface layers of molecular clouds illuminated by
the UV radiation of the newly formed, young stars. We present high-angular
resolution sub-millimeter observations in the N159W region in the LMC obtained
with the NANTEN2 telescope of the 12CO J = 4-3, J = 7-6, and 13CO J = 4-3
rotational and [CI] 3P1-3P0 and 3P2-3P1 fine-structure transitions. The 13CO J
=4-3 and [CI] 3P2-3P1 transitions are detected for the first time in the LMC.
We derive the physical and chemical properties of the low-metallicity molecular
gas using an escape probability code and a self-consistent solution of the
chemistry and thermal balance of the gas in the framework of a clumpy cloud PDR
model. The separate excitation analysis of the submm CO lines and the carbon
fine structure lines shows that the emitting gas in the N159W region has
temperatures of about 80 K and densities of about 10^4 cm^-3. The estimated C
to CO abundance ratio close to unity is substantially higher than in dense
massive star-forming regions in the Milky Way. The analysis of all observed
lines together, including the [CII] line intensity reported in the literature,
in the context of a clumpy cloud PDR model constrains the UV intensity to about
\chi ~220 and an average density of the clump ensemble of about 10^5 cm^-3,
thus confirming the presence of high density material in the LMC N159W region.

Therefore, building better prognostic models are required. We analysed
hydraulic and thermal properties of the major rock types in the Molasse Basin
in Southern Germany. On about 400 samples thermal conductivity, density,
porosity, and sonic velocity were measured. Here, we propose a three-step
procedure with increasing complexity for analysis of the data set: First,
univariate descriptive statistics provides a general understanding of the data
structure, possibly still with large uncertainty. Examples show that the
remaining uncertainty can be as high as 0.8 W/(m K) or as low as 0.1 W/(m K).
This depends on the possibility to subdivide the geologic units into data sets
that are also petrophysically similar. Then, based on all measurements,
cross-plot and quick-look methods are used to gain more insight into
petrophysical relationships and to refine the analysis. Because these measures
usually imply an exactly determined system they do not provide strict error
bounds. The final, most complex step comprises a full inversion of select
subsets of the data comprising both laboratory and borehole measurements. The
example presented shows the possibility to refine the used mixing laws for
Petrophysical properties and the estimation of mineral properties. These can be
estimated to an accuracy of 0.3 W/(m K). The predictive errors for the
measurements are 0.07 W/(m K), 70 m/s, and 8 kg/m^3 for thermal conductivity,
sonic velocity, and bulk density, respectively.

large number of velocities in the survey. Simulations of LambdaCDM-like models
are used to test the methods. We calculate the likelihood from a full
covariance matrix of velocities averaged in grid cells. This simultaneously
reduces the number of data points and smooths out nonlinearities which tend to
dominate on small scales. We show how the averaging can be taken into account
in the predictions in a practical way, and show the effect of the choice of
cell size. We find that a cell size can be chosen that significantly reduces
the nonlinearities without significantly increasing the error bars on
cosmological parameters. We compare our results with those from a principal
components analysis following Watkins et al (2002) and Feldman et al (2003) to
select a set of optimal moments constructed from linear combinations of the
peculiar velocities that are least sensitive to the nonlinear scales. We
conclude that averaging in grid cells performs equally well. We find that for a
survey such as 6dFGSv we can estimate sigma_8 with less than 3% bias from
nonlinearities. The expected error on sigma_8 after marginalising over Omega_m

phase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.
Formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressure
in the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of the
total energy density in the Universe. The simplest option for this ""dark
energy"" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantum
vacuum energy. Physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of a
scalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of general
relativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. Although
they produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurable
differences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. A
fingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, which
introduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxy
redshift surveys. Here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of
0.8. Using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure the
anisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate of
structure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. This is consistent with the
standard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,
although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternative
origins for the accelerated expansion. This could be achieved with a further
factor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

formulation of physics (1T-physics) is similar to the relation between a
3-dimensional object moving in a room and its multiple shadows moving on walls
when projected from different perspectives. The multiple shadows as seen by
observers stuck on the wall are analogous to the effects of the 2T-universe as
experienced in ordinary 1T spacetime. In this paper we develop some of the
quantitative aspects of this 2T to 1T relationship in the context of field
theory. We discuss 2T field theory in d+2 dimensions and its shadows in the
form of 1T field theories when the theory contains Klein-Gordon, Dirac and
Yang-Mills fields, such as the Standard Model of particles and forces. We show
that the shadow 1T field theories must have hidden relations among themselves.
These relations take the form of dualities and hidden spacetime symmetries. A
subset of the shadows are 1T field theories in different gravitational
backgrounds (different space-times) such as the flat Minkowski spacetime, the
Robertson-Walker expanding universe, AdS(d-k) x S(k) and others, including
singular ones. We explicitly construct the duality transformations among this
conformally flat subset, and build the generators of their hidden SO(d,2)
symmetry. The existence of such hidden relations among 1T field theories, which
can be tested by both theory and experiment in 1T-physics, is part of the
evidence for the underlying d+2 dimensional spacetime and the unifying
2T-physics structure.

advertising, namely the consequences of broad match-a feature where an ad of an
advertiser can be mapped to a broader range of relevant queries, and not
necessarily to the particular keyword(s) that ad is associated with. Starting
with a very natural setting for strategies available to the advertisers, and
via a careful look through the algorithmic lens, we first propose solution
concepts for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as
they try to optimize their budget allocation across various keywords. Next, we
consider two broad match scenarios based on factors such as information
asymmetry between advertisers and the auctioneer, and the extent of
auctioneer's control on the budget splitting. In the first scenario, the
advertisers have the full information about broad match and relevant
parameters, and can reapportion their own budgets to utilize the extra
information; in particular, the auctioneer has no direct control over budget
splitting. We show that, the same broad match may lead to different equilibria,
one leading to a revenue improvement, whereas another to a revenue loss. This
leaves the auctioneer in a dilemma - whether to broad-match or not. This
motivates us to consider another broad match scenario, where the advertisers
have information only about the current scenario, and the allocation of the
budgets unspent in the current scenario is in the control of the auctioneer. We
observe that the auctioneer can always improve his revenue by judiciously using
broad match. Thus, information seems to be a double-edged sword for the
auctioneer.

forecast.
  With the SOHO/SUMER spectroscopic observations of the 2000 September 26
event, we propose another precursor for CME eruptions, namely, long-time
prominence oscillations.
  The prominence oscillation-and-eruption event was observed by ground-based
H$\alpha$ telescopes and space-borne white-light, EUV imaging and spectroscopic
instruments. In particular, the SUMER slit was observing the prominence in a
sit-and-stare mode.
  The observations indicate that a siphon flow was moving from the proximity of
the prominence to a site at a projected distance of 270$''$, which was followed
by repetitive H$\alpha$ surges and continual prominence oscillations. The
oscillation lasted 4 hours before the prominence erupted as a blob-like CME.
The analysis of the multiwavelength data indicates that the whole series of
processes fits well into the emerging flux trigger mechanism for CMEs. In this
mechanism, emerging magnetic flux drives a siphon flow due to increased gas
pressure where the background polarity emerges. It also drives H$\alpha$ surges
through magnetic reconnection where the opposite polarity emerges. The magnetic
reconnection triggers the prominence oscillations, as well as its loss of
equilibrium, which finally leads to the eruption of the prominence. It is also
found that the reconnection between the emerging flux and the pre-existing
magnetic loop proceeds in an intermittent, probably quasi-periodic, way.

Relativity we embark on a non-chronological derivation of the Robertson-Walker

Gaussian curvature. This permits the definition of all relativistic distance
measures needed in observational astronomy. Only thereafter do we come to
General Relativity, and describe some of its consequences: gravitational
lensing, black holes, various tests, and the cornerstone of the standard Big
Bang model, the Friedmann-Lemaitre equations. Going backwards in time towards
Big Bang we first have to trace the thermal history, and then understand the
needs for a cosmic inflation and its predictions. The knowledge of the Big Bang
model is based notably on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation, large scale structures, and the redshifts of distant supernovae.

scaling than classical multihop schemes under certain assumptions on the

schemes. A modification of the scheme is proposed here that achieves a
throughput-delay trade-off $D(n)=(\log n)^2 T(n)$ for T(n) between
$\Theta(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ and $\Theta(n/\log n)$, where D(n) and T(n) are
respectively the average delay per bit and the aggregate throughput in a
network of n nodes. This trade-off complements the previous results of El Gamal

given by D(n)=T(n) where T(n) lies between $\Theta(1)$ and $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.
  Meanwhile, the present paper considers the network multiple-access problem,
which may be of interest in its own right.

planetary migration in the protoplanetary disc. After a resonant capture, the
subsequent migration in this configuration leads to a large increase of
planetary eccentricities if no damping mechanism is applied. This has led to
the conclusion that the migration of resonant planetary systems cannot occur
over large radial distances and has to be terminated sufficiently rapidly
through disc dissipation.
  In this study, we investigate whether the presence of an inner disc might
supply an eccentricity damping of the inner planet, and if this effect could
explain the observed eccentricities in some systems. To investigate the
influence of an inner disc, we first compute hydrodynamic simulations of giant
planets orbiting with a given eccentricity around an inner gas disc, and
measure the effect of the latter on the planetary orbital parameters. We then
perform detailed long term calculations of the GJ 876 system. We also run
N-body simulations with artificial forces on the planets mimicking the effects
of the inner and outer discs.
  We find that the influence of the inner disc can not be neglected, and that
it might be responsible for the observed eccentricities. In particular, we
reproduce quite well the orbital parameters of a few systems engaged in 2:1
mean motion resonances: GJ 876, HD 73526, HD 82943 and HD 128311. Finally, we
derive analytically the effect that the inner disc should have on the inner
planet to reach a specific orbital configuration with a given damping effect of
the outer disc on the outer planet.

obtain a new family of criteria that are independent of the original one. This

hole (BH) mass estimates based on the application of the virial theorem to
broad emission lines in AGN spectra. BH masses based only on the virial product
V^2R and neglecting the effect of radiation pressure can be severely
underestimated especially in objects close to the Eddington limit. We provide
an empirical calibration of the correction for radiation pressure and we show
that it is consistent with a simple physical model in which BLR clouds are
optically thick to ionizing radiation and have average column densities of
NH~10^23 cm^-2. This value is remarkably similar to what is required in
standard BLR photoionization models to explain observed spectra. With the
inclusion of radiation pressure the discrepancy between virial BH masses based
on single epoch spectra and on reverberation mapping data drops from 0.4 to 0.2
dex rms. The use of single epoch observations as surrogates of reverberation
mapping campaigns can thus provide more accurate BH masses than previously
thought. Finally, we show that Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have
apparently low BH masses because they are radiating close to their Eddington
limit. After the radiation pressure correction, NLS1 galaxies have BH masses
similar to other broad line AGNs and follow the same MBH-sigma/L relations as
other active and normal galaxies. Radiation forces arising from ionizing photon
momentum deposition constitute an important physical effect which must be taken
into account when computing virial BH masses.

Chandra reveals a line-rich X-ray absorption spectrum consistent with a disk
wind. Prior modeling of the spectrum suggested that the wind may be
magnetically driven, potentially providing insights into the nature of disk
accretion onto black holes. In this paper, we present results obtained with new
models for this spectrum, generated using three independent photoionization
codes: XSTAR, Cloudy, and our own code. Fits to the spectrum in particular
narrow wavelength ranges, in evenly spaced wavelength slices, and across a
broad wavelength band all strongly prefer a combination of high density, high
ionization, and small inner radius. Indeed, the results obtained from all three
codes require a wind that originates more than 10 times closer to the black
hole and carrying a mass flux that is on the order of 1000 times higher than
predicted by thermal driving models. If seminal work on thermally-driven disk
winds is robust, magnetic forces may play a role in driving the disk wind in
GRO J1655-40. However, even these modeling efforts must be regarded as crude
given the complexity of the spectra. We discuss these results in the context of

LARES data with those of the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites, it is of
the utmost importance to assess if the claimed accuracy \lesssim 1% will be
realistically obtainable. A major source of systematic error is the
mismodelling \delta J_L in the static part of the even zonal harmonic
coefficients J_L, L=2,4,6,.. of the multipolar expansion of the classical part
of the terrestrial gravitational potential; such a bias crucially depends on
the orbital configuration of LARES. If for \delta J_L the difference between
the best estimates of different Earth's gravity solutions from the dedicated
GRACE mission is conservatively taken instead of optimistically considering the
statistical covariance sigmas of each model separately, as done so far in
literature, it turns out that, since LARES will be likely launched in a
low-orbit (semimajor axis a\lesssim 7600 km), the bias due to the geopotential
may be up to ten times larger than what claimed, according to a calculation up
to degree L=20. Taking into account also the even zonal harmonics with L>20, as
required by the relatively low altitude of LARES, may further degrade the total
accuracy. Should a nearly polar configuration (inclination to the Earth's
equator i\approx 90 deg) be finally implemented, also other perturbations would
come into play, further corrupting the measurement of the Lense-Thirring
effect. The orbital configuration of LARES may also have some consequences in

body located further out in the disc. We consider outermost planets with masses
ranging from 10 earth masses to 1 M_J. We also examine the case of outermost
bodies with masses < 10 earth masses (M_E). Differential migration of the
planets due to disc torques leads to different evolution outcomes depending on
the mass of the outer protoplanet. For planets with mass < 3.5 M_E the type II
migration rate of the giant exceeds the type I migration rate of the outer
body, resulting in divergent migration. Outer bodies with masses in the range
3.5 < m_o < 20 M_E become trapped at the edge of the gap formed by the giant
planet, because of corotation torques. Higher mass planets are captured into
resonance with the inner planet. If 30 < m_o < 40 M_E or m_o=1 M_J, then the
2:1 resonance is established. If 80 < m_o < 100 M_E, the 3:2 resonance is
favoured. Simulations of gas-accreting protoplanets of mass m_o > 20 M_E,
trapped initially at the edge of the gap, or in the 2:1 resonance, also result
in eventual capture in the 3:2 resonance as the planet mass grows to become
close to the mass of Saturn. Our results suggest that there is a theoretical
lower limit to the mass of an outer planet that can be captured into resonance
with an inner Jovian planet, which is relevant to observations of extrasolar
multiplanet systems. Furthermore, capture of a Saturn-like planet into the 3:2
resonance with a Jupiter-like planet is a very robust outcome of simulations.
This result is relevant to recent scenarios of early Solar System evolution

jet beam behind the Mach disk, for various jet Lorentz factors and magnetic
field helicities. We investigate the influence of helical magnetic fields on
jet beam propagation in overdense external medium. We use the AMRVAC code,
employing a novel hybrid block-based AMR strategy, to compute ideal plasma
dynamics in special relativity. The helicity of the beam magnetic field is
effectively transported down the beam, with compression zones in between
diagonal internal cross-shocks showing stronger toroidal field regions. In
comparison with equivalent low-relativistic jets which get surrounded by
cocoons with vortical backflows filled by mainly toroidal field, the high speed
jets demonstrate only localized, strong toroidal field zones within the
backflow vortical structures. We find evidence for a more poloidal, straight
field layer, compressed between jet beam and backflows. This layer decreases
the destabilizing influence of the backflow on the jet beam. In all cases, the
jet beam contains rich cross-shock patterns, across which part of the kinetic
energy gets transferred. For the high speed reference jet considered here,
significant jet deceleration only occurs beyond distances exceeding ${\cal
O}(100 R_j)$, as the axial flow can reaccelerate downstream to the internal
cross-shocks. This reacceleration is magnetically aided, due to field
compression across the internal shocks which pinch the flow.

classical 5D solution will correspond to a quantum corrected 4D black hole. We
show that a Schwarzschild-AdS black string in the bulk can be consistently
interpreted as a quantum-corrected black hole on the brane, but the form of the
quantum corrections is unlike what we would expect. The stress tensor extracted
from the bulk solution does not have a thermal component corresponding to
Hawking radiation outside the black hole. We compare this strong coupling
prediction to a weak coupling calculation to study the differences in detail.
We comment on implications for asymptotically flat black holes and for black
holes localised in the extra dimension.

identifications of the component connected to the identity, of spinors of
eleven-dimensional and type II supergravities. The $\Sigma$ groups are products
of a Spin group and an R-symmetry group of a suitable lower dimensional
supergravity theory. Using the case of SU(4)-invariant spinors as a paradigm,
we demonstrate that the $\Sigma$ groups, and so the R-symmetry groups of
lower-dimensional supergravity theories arising from compactifications, have
disconnected components. These lead to discrete symmetry groups reminiscent of
R-parity. We examine the role of disconnected components of the $\Sigma$ groups
in the choice of Killing spinor representatives and in the context of
compactifications.
