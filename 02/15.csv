The gravitational microlensing planet search method is potentially sensitive to
multiple-planet systems containing analogs of all the solar system planets
except Mercury. We report the detection of a multiple-planet system with
microlensing. We identify two planets with masses of ~0.71 and ~0.27 times the
mass of Jupiter and orbital separations of ~2.3 and ~4.6 astronomical units
orbiting a primary star of mass ~0.50 solar masses at a distance of ~1.5
kiloparsecs. This system resembles a scaled version of our solar system in that
the mass ratio, separation ratio, and equilibrium temperatures of the planets
are similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn. These planets could not have been
detected with other techniques; their discovery from only six confirmed
microlensing planet detections suggests that solar system analogs may be
common.

harbor point sources. The J=1-0 transitions of CO, 13CO, C18O, and HCO+,
measured with the 13.7m telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory, exhibit
asymmetric line profiles. Our analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
shows that all of the three sub-mm clumps are massive (110--210 $M_{\odot}$),
with average dust temperatures in the range ~20--40K. A multi-wavelength
comparison convinces us that the asymmetric profiles of molecular lines should
result from two clouds at slightly different velocities, and it further
confirms that the star-forming activity in SMM1 is stimulated by a cloud-cloud
collision. The stellar contents and SEDs suggest that SMM1 and SMM3 are
high-mass and intermediate-mass star-forming sites respectively. However, SMM2
has no counterpart downwards 70 micron, which is likely to be a cold high-mass
starless core. These results, as mentioned above, expose multiple phases of

fraction at a relatively older age of $\sim$10 Myr. A comparison with younger

Typically, these tasks are performed by first reducing the high-dimensional

methods have been developed for this task. In many practical problems however,
the assumption of a Euclidean manifold cannot be justified. In these cases, a
more appropriate assumption would be that the data lies on a statistical

we propose using the properties of information geometry in order to define
similarities between data sets using the Fisher information metric. We will
show this metric can be approximated using entirely non-parametric methods, as
the parameterization of the manifold is generally unknown. Furthermore, by
using multi-dimensional scaling methods, we are able to embed the corresponding
PDFs into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This not only allows for
classification of the data, but also visualization of the manifold. As a whole,

performance and limitations of what I named ""Telescope-Interferometers"" (TIs).
The basic idea consists in transforming one telescope into a Wavefront Error
(WFE) sensing device. This can be achieved in two different ways, namely the
off axis and phase-shifting TIs. In both cases the Point-Spread Function (PSF)
measured in the focal plane of the telescope carries information about the
transmitted WFE, which is retrieved by fast and simple algorithms suitable to
an Adaptive Optics (AO) regime. Herein are evaluated the uncertainties of both
types of TIs, in terms of noise and systematic errors. Numerical models are
developed in order to establish the dependence of driving parameters such as
useful spectral range, angular size of the observed star, or detector noise on
the total WFE measurement error. The latter is found particularly sensitive to
photon noise, which rapidly governs the achieved accuracy for telescope
diameters higher than 10 m. We study a few practical examples, showing that TI
method is applicable to AO systems on telescope diameters ranging from 10 to 50
m, depending on seeing conditions and magnitude of the observed stars. We also
discuss the case of a space-borne coronagraph where TI technique provides high
sampling of the input WFE map.

we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on the classical T Tauri star BP
Tau. Circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrow
emission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout most
of the rotation cycle of BP Tau at two different epochs in 2006. We observe
that rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of both
unpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphere
and the footpoints of accretion funnels.
  From the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scale
magnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of BP Tau
using tomographic imaging. We find that the field of BP Tau involves a 1.2 kG
dipole and 1.6 kG octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation
axis. Accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at high
latitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of the
stellar surface. The strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of BP Tau is
very reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. It suggests
that magnetic fields of fully-convective cTTSs such as BP Tau are likely not

  Preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of BP Tau extends to
distances of at least 4 R* to ensure that accretion spots are located at high
latitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellar
wind. It apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as
the corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of BP Tau.

used to analyse colours, magnitudes and spectral indicies of the infrared

point sources was obtained. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these 50
sources was extended to the near-infrared and millimeter range by using 2MASS
and millimeter data from the literature. An online SED fitter tool based on
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer of an accretion model involving star,disk and
envelope was used to fit the SEDs of the 50 sources. The IRCs to massive
protostellar objects are found to successfully imitate the SEDs of evolutionary
phases similar to low mass star formation. Envelope accretion, rather than disk
accretion is found to be dominant in building the most massive stars.
Unresolved centimeter continuum emission is associated with 27 IRCs classified
as massive protostars suggesting that ionised accretion flows may play an
important role along with the molecular component. The morphology of the
infrared nebulae surrounding the IRCs have an unusual resemblance to the
morphologies of ultra-compact HII regions suggesting that these infrared
nebulae are possible precursors to the UCHII regions.

accretes material from a companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass,
collapses and explodes. Alternatively, two white dwarfs merge, again causing
catastrophic collapse and an explosion. It has hitherto been impossible to

for this supernova, although the host galaxy is older (6-9 Gyr) than the age at

Telescope. This field contains a spectroscopically confirmed space-overdensity
of Lyman-alpha and H-alpha emitting galaxies which surrounds the powerful radio
galaxy MRC 1138-262. Using these NICMOS data we identify a significant
surface-overdensity (= 6.2x) of red J-H galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram
(when compared with deep NICMOS imaging from the HDF-N and UDF). The
optical-NIR colors of these prospective red-sequence galaxies indicate the
presence of on-going dust-obscured star-formation or recently formed (<~ 1.5
Gyr)stellar populations in a majority of the red galaxies. We measure the slope
and intrinsic scatter of the CMR for three different red galaxy samples
selected by a wide color cut, and using photometric redshifts both with and
without restrictions on rest-frame optical morphology. In all three cases both
the rest-frame $U-B$ slope and intrinsic color scatter are considerably higher
than corresponding values for lower redshift galaxy clusters. These results
suggest that while some relatively quiescent galaxies do exist in this
protocluster both the majority of the galaxy population and hence the
color-magnitude relation are still in the process of forming, as expected.

  No source is detected in the new Chandra images, taken six weeks after

the position of the supernova (SN) is fainter than in the pre-outburst images,
depending on the choice of aperture, which supports the identification of the
archival X-ray source with the SN.
  Detailed astrometry of the X-ray and new optical images, however, gives an
offset between the supernova and the measured X-ray source position of
1.15+/-0.27"". Extensive simulations show that the probability of finding an
offset of this magnitude is ~1%, equal to the (trial-corrected) probability of
a chance alignment with any X-ray source in the field. This casts doubt on the
identification of the X-ray source with the progenitor, although the scenario
in which at least some of the observed X-rays are connected to the supernova
may be the least unlikely based on all available data.
  After a brief review of the auxiliary evidence, we conclude that only future
X-ray observations can shed further light on the proposed connection between
the X-ray source and the progenitor of SN 2007on, and thus whether an accreting
white dwarf scenario is truly favoured for this SN Ia.

stars or stellar systems at a nearly constant star formation efficiency. This
article presents a series of numerical experiments evolving distributions of
dense cores into stars to quantify the effects of stellar multiplicity, global
core fragmentation, and a varying star formation efficiency. We find that the
different evolutionary schemes have an overall small effect on the shape of the

observational accuracy the comparison between the mass functions of dense cores

stars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to
have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way
halo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]
abundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One
of our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost
all of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low
[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an
incomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM. Our derived
element ratios are consistent with the episodic and extended SF in Carina known
from its color-magnitude diagram. We find a considerable star-to-star scatter
in the abundance ratios. This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with
position within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. Alternatively, the SF rate
is so low that the high-mass stellar IMF is sparsely populated, as
statistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter in
the resultant mass-integrated yields. Both ideas are consistent with slow
stochastic SF in dissolving associations, so that one may not speak of a single
SF history at a detailed level (Abridged).

estimator to obtain precise measurements of the LRG auto-correlations and
constrain halo occupation distributions for them. These are used to generate
mock catalogs which aid in interpreting our quasar-LRG cross correlation
measurements. The cross correlation is well described by a power law with slope
1.8\pm0.1 and r_0=6\pm0.5 h^{-1} Mpc, consistent with observed galaxy
correlation functions. We find no evidence for `excess' clustering on 0.1 Mpc
scales and demonstrate that this is consistent with the results of Serber et al
(2006) and Strand et al (2007), when one accounts for several subtleties in the
interpretation of their measurements. Combining the quasar-LRG cross
correlation with the LRG auto-correlations, we determine a large-scale quasar
bias b_QSO = 1.09\pm0.15 at a median redshift of 0.43, with no observed
redshift or luminosity evolution. This corresponds to a mean halo mass <M>~
10^{12} h^{-1} M_sun, Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1 and lifetimes less than
10^{7} yr. Using simple models of halo occupation, these correspond to a number
density of quasar hosts greater than 10^{-3} h^{3} Mpc^{-3} and stellar masses
less than 10^{11} h^{-1} M_sun. The small-scale clustering signal can be
interpreted with the aid of our mock LRG catalogs, and depends on the manner in
which quasars inhabit halos. We find that our small scale measurements are
inconsistent with quasar positions being randomly subsampled from halo centers

which can be regarded as continuum ensembles of non-intersecting contours in
the plane, sharing a number of features with the two-dimensional Ising model.
We introduce non-homogeneous version of polygonal fields in anisotropic
enviroment. For these fields we provide a class of new graphical constructions
and random dynamics. These include a generalised dynamic representation,
generalised and defective disagreement loop dynamics as well as a generalised
contour birth and death dynamics. Next, we use these constructions as tools to
obtain new exact results on the geometry of higher order correlations of
polygonal Markov fields in their consistent regime.

several cases, a new mechanism is proposed for the formation of the emission
gaps seen between the radio lobes of many powerful extragalactic double radio
sources. Canonical understanding of the radio gaps invokes either blocking of
the back-flowing lobe plasma by the denser interstellar medium (ISM) of the
host galaxy, or ""squeezing"" of the radio bridge in the middle through buoyancy
force exerted by either the ISM or the surrounding intra-cluster medium (ICM).
These pictures encounter difficulties in explaining situations where the
sharp-edged radio gaps associated with non-cluster radio galaxies have widths
running into several tens (even hundreds) of kiloparsecs. More particularly,
the required dense high-pressure ISM/ICM is likely to be lacking at least in
the case of high-redshift radio galaxies. We propose here that radio emission
gaps in at least such cases could arise from a dynamical interaction between
the powerful thermal wind outflowing from the active galactic nucleus and the
back-flowing synchrotron plasma in the two radio lobes, which occurs once the
rapidly advancing jets have crossed out of the wind zone into the intergalactic
medium. A simple analytical scheme is presented to explore the plausibility of
the side-ways confinement of the thermal wind by the radio lobe pair, which
would ""freeze"" pancake shaped conduits in the space, along which the hot, metal
enriched wind from the AGN can escape (roughly orthogonal to the radio axis).
Some other possible consequences of this scenario are pointed out.

the microscopic level, this path integral intuitively describes a physics with
many quantum realities thus leading to a novel concept of manifold of physics,
which can be looked at as a novel action principle. This paradigm reflects the
notion that the observed laws of physics on any given scale are determined by
the underlying distribution of the fundamental parameters (i.e Quantum
Mechanics is just one point on this manifold), thus leading to many possible
physical-law based behaviors. By choosing a Gaussian distribution of the
parameters, a quadratic action term appears in the path-integral, which in
turns leads to a complex classical action (and by continuation a new
description for inertia) at the classical level. In the accompanying manuscript
the classical doublet equation of motion is applied to the Newtonian
gravitation field, and a MOND-like, dark-energy-like, and pioneer-anomaly-like

dominates all the nodes, where a node $v$ is power dominated if (1) $v$ is in
$S$ or it has a neighbor in $S$, or (2) $v$ has a neighbor $u$ such that $u$

heavy-fermion antiferromagnet CeIn3 by means of nuclear-quadrupole-resonance
(NQR) studies conducted under a high pressure. The temperature and pressure
dependences of the NQR spectra have revealed a first-order quantum-phase
transition (QPT) from an AFM to PM at a critical pressure Pc=2.46 GPa. Despite
the lack of an AFM quantum critical point in the P-T phase diagram, we
highlight the fact that the unconventional SC occurs in both phases of the AFM
and PM. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the AFM phase have
provided evidence for the uniformly coexisting AFM+SC phase. In the HF-PM phase
where AFM fluctuations are not developed, 1/T1 decreases without the coherence
peak just below Tc, followed by a power-law like T dependence that indicates an
unconventional SC with a line-node gap. Remarkably, Tc has a peak around Pc in
the HF-PM phase as well as in the AFM phase. In other words, an SC dome exists
with a maximum value of Tc = 230 mK around Pc, indicating that the origin of
the pressure-induced HF SC in CeIn3 is not relevant to AFM spin fluctuations
but to the emergence of the first-order QPT in CeIn3. When the AFM critical
temperature is suppressed at the termination point of the first-order QPT, Pc =
2.46 GPa, the diverging AFM spin-density fluctuations emerge at the critical
point from the AFM to PM. The results with CeIn3 leading to a new type of
quantum criticality deserve further theoretical investigations.

the Ruppeiner curvature, we newly propose the curvature scalar in the 2D

is based on the definition of a new distance measuring the difference between
variations of two distributions on a finite number of points from their support
and on using this measure for estimation purposes by the method of minimum
distance. For the second method, given an empirical discrete distribution, we
build up an auxiliary discrete theoretical distribution having the same support
of the first and depending on the same parameters of the parent distribution of
the data from which the empirical distribution emanated. We estimate then the
parameters from the empirical distribution by the usual statistical methods. In
practice, we propose to compute the two estimations, the second based on
maximum likelihood principle of known theoretical properties, and the first
being as a control of the effectiveness of the obtained estimation, and for
which we prove the convergence in probability, so we have also a criterion on
the quality of the information contained in the observations. We apply the
approach to truncated or grouped and censored data situations to give the
flavour on the effectiveness of the approach. We give also some interesting

estimation of the initial trial value in the celebrate EM algorithm in the case

with arcs found at radii smaller than ~5''. Simple mass models are constructed
for the best lens candidates and our results are compared to the strong lensing
catalogs of the SLACS survey and the CASTLES database. These new strong
galaxy-galaxy lensing systems constitute a valuable sample to study the mass

further expect this sample to play an important role in the testing of software

of strong galaxy-galaxy systems in current and future space-based wide-field
imaging surveys. We expect that such surveys should uncover a large number of
strong lensing systems (more than 10 systems per square degree), which will
allow for a detailed statistical analysis of galaxy properties and will likely
lead to constraints on models of gravitational structure formation and
cosmology. The sample of strong lenses is available here:

means of the new synthesis code ASSET, which overcomes limitations of
previously available codes by including a consistent treatment of scattering
and allowing for arbitrarily complex line and continuum opacities. In the
continuum, we find very similar discrepancies between synthesis and observation
for both types of model atmospheres. This is in contrast to previous studies
that used a ``horizontally'' and time averaged representation of the 3-D model
and found a significantly larger disagreement with observations. The presence
of temperature and velocity fields in the 3-D simulation provides a significant
advantage when it comes to reproduce solar spectral line shapes. Nonetheless, a
comparison of observed and synthetic equivalent widths reveals that the 3-D
model also predicts more uniform abundances as a function of position angle on
the disk. We conclude that the 3-D simulation provides not only a more
realistic description of the gas dynamics, but, despite its simplified
treatment of the radiation transport, it also predicts reasonably well the
observed Center-to-Limb variation, which is indicative of a thermal structure
free from significant systematic errors.

Packings of hard spheres are of even wider interest, as they are related to
important problems in information theory, such as digitalization of signals,
error correcting codes, and optimization problems. In three dimensions the
densest packing of identical hard spheres has been proven to be the FCC
lattice, and it is conjectured that the closest packing is ordered (a regular
lattice, e.g, a crystal) in low enough dimension. Still, amorphous packings
have attracted a lot of interest, because for polydisperse colloids and
granular materials the crystalline state is not obtained in experiments for
kinetic reasons. We review here a theory of amorphous packings, and more
generally glassy states, of hard spheres that is based on the replica method:
this theory gives predictions on the structure and thermodynamics of these
states. In dimensions between two and six these predictions can be successfully
compared with numerical simulations. We will also discuss the limit of large
dimension where an exact solution is possible. Some of the results we present
here have been already published, but others are original: in particular we
improved the discussion of the large dimension limit and we obtained new
results on the correlation function and the contact force distribution in three

cosmic rays from the general direction of the heliotail, also close to the

assumptions underlying our proposed scenario are that the Geminga supernova
occurred about 3.4 10^5 years ago (as indicated by the spin down timescale),
that a burst of cosmic rays was injected with total energy 10^49 erg (i.e.,
about 1% of a typical SN output), and that the Geminga pulsar was born with a
positive radial velocity of 100--200 km s^-1. We find that our hypothesis is
consistent with the available information. In a first variant (likely
oversimplified), the cosmic rays have diffused according to the Bohm
prescription (i.e., with a diffusion coefficient on the order of c times r_L,
with c the speed of light and r_L the Larmor radius). An alternative scheme
assumes that diffusion only occurred initially, and the final propagation to
the Sun was a free streaming in a diverging magnetic field. If the observed
cosmic ray excess does indeed arise from the Geminga SN explosion, the
long--sought ""smoking gun"" connecting cosmic rays with supernovae would finally
be at hand. It could be said that, while looking for the ""smoking gun"", we were

previously studied problems. Given a ground set V and a collection of subsets
S_i of V, a feasible solution is a partition of V such that each subset of the
partition is included in one of the S_i. The problem involves maximizing the
mean subset size of the partition, where the mean is the generalized mean of
parameter p, taken over the elements. For p=-1, the problem is equivalent to
the classical minimum set cover problem. For p=0, it is equivalent to the
minimum entropy set cover problem, introduced by Halperin and Karp. For p=1,
the problem includes the maximum-edge clique partition problem as a special
case. We prove that the greedy algorithm simultaneously approximates the
problem within a factor of (p+1)^1/p for any p in R^+, and that this is the
best possible unless P=NP. These results both generalize and simplify previous
results for special cases. We also consider the corresponding graph coloring
problem, and prove several tractability and inapproximability results. Finally,
we consider a further generalization of the set cover problem in which we aim
at minimizing the sum of some concave function of the part sizes. As an
application, we derive an approximation ratio for a Rent-or-Buy set cover
problem.

production by isotropic cosmic-ray ions drifting upstream of SNR shocks. The
studies aim at testing recent predictions of a strong amplification of short
wavelength magnetic field and at studying the evolution of the magnetic
turbulence and its backreaction on cosmic rays. We observe that an oblique
filamentary mode grows more rapidly than the non-resonant parallel modes found
in analytical theory, and the growth rate of the field perturbations is much
slower than is estimated for the parallel plane-wave mode, possibly because in
our simulations we cannot maintain omega << Omega_i, the ion gyrofrequency, to
the degree required for the plane-wave mode to emerge. The evolved oblique
filamentary mode was also observed in MHD simulations to dominate in the
nonlinear phase. We thus confirm the generation of the turbulent magnetic field
due to the drift of cosmic-ray ions in the upstream plasma, but as our main
result find that the amplitude of the turbulence saturates at about dB/B~1. The
backreaction of the turbulence on the particles leads to an alignment of the
bulk-flow velocities of the cosmic rays and the background medium, which is an
essential characteristic of cosmic-ray modified shocks. It accounts for the
saturation of the instability at moderate field amplitudes. Previously
published MHD simulations have assumed a constant cosmic-ray current and no
energy or momentum flux in the cosmic rays, which excludes a backreaction of
the generated magnetic field on cosmic rays, and thus the saturation of the
field amplitude is artificially suppressed. This may explain the continued
growth of the magnetic field in the MHD simulations. A strong magnetic field
amplification to amplitudes dB >> B0 has not been demonstrated yet.

of alternating streaming and collision steps. The advantage of the harmonic
interactions is that the integration of the equations of motion in the
streaming step can be performed analytically. Therefore, the algorithm is
computationally as efficient as the original MPC algorithm for Newtonian
fluids. The collision step is the same as in the original MPC method. All

potentials are applied to obtain a nearly uniform density everywhere in the

the bulk. The thickness of this layer is proportional to the average dumbbell
size. We determine the zero-shear viscosities as a function of the spring
constant of the dumbbells and the mean free path. For very high shear rates, a
very weak ``shear thickening'' behavior is observed. Moreover, storage and loss
moduli are calculated in oscillatory shear, which show that the viscoelastic

dependencies, respectively, with physically reasonable values of d-wave node
gap parameter and paramagnetic impurity scattering rate. Our next topic is
related to the flux distribution in our films. More precisely, we present a
comparative study on their pinning ability at low magnetic fields extracted
from their AC susceptibilities. Depending on the level of homogeneity of our
films, two different types of the irreversibility line have been found. The
obtained results are described via the critical-state model taking into account
the low-field grain-boundary pinning. And finally, we demonstrate our recent
results on the normal state temperature behavior of resistivity R(T) for the
high-quality optimally-doped SCCO thin films. In addition to the expected
contributions from the electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering
processes, we also observed an unusual step-like behavior of R(T) around T=87K
which we attributed the to the manifestation of thermal excitations due to spin
fluctuations induced by Sm3+ moments through Cu2+-Sm3+ interaction.

Cloud region in the J = 1-0 transition of 12CO and 13CO. The image of the cloud
in each velocity channel includes ~ 3 million Nyquist sampled pixels on a 20""
grid. The high sensitivity and large linear dynamic range of the maps in both
isotopologues reveal a very complex, highly structured cloud morphology. There
are large scale correlated structures evident in 13CO emission having very fine
dimensions, including filaments, cavities, and rings. The 12CO emission shows a
quite different structure, with particularly complex interfaces between regions
of greater and smaller column density defining the boundaries of the
largest-scale cloud structures. The axes of the striations seen in the 12CO
emission from relatively diffuse gas are aligned with the direction of the
magnetic field. Using a column density-dependent model for the CO fractional
abundance, we derive the mass of the region mapped to be 24,000 solar masses, a
factor of three greater than would be obtained with canonical CO abundance
restricted to the high column density regions. We determine that half the mass
of the cloud is in regions having column density below 2.1x10^{21} per square
cm. The distribution of young stars in the region covered is highly nonuniform,
with the probability of finding a star in a pixel with a specified column
density rising sharply for N(H2) = 6x10^{21} cm^{-2}. We determine a relatively
low star formation efficiency (mass of young stars/mass of molecular gas),
between 0.3 and 1.2 %, and an average star formation rate during the past 3 Myr
of 8x10^{-5} stars yr^{-1}.

transported to the corona via these magnetic tubes. This energy exchange from
the disc to the corona which depends on the disc physical properties is
modified because of the magnetic interaction between the stellar magnetic field
and the accretion disc. According to our fully analytical solutions for such a

reduces the temperature of the accretion disc. Also, the presence of a corona
enhances the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure. Our solutions show
that when the strength of the magnetic field of the central neutron star is

determines not only the mass accretion process but possibly the spin evolution
of the central star. We have taken a recently-published surface magnetogram of
one moderately-accreting T Tauri star (V2129 Oph) and used it to extrapolate
the geometry of its large-scale field. We determine the structure of the open
(wind-bearing) field lines, the closed (X-ray bright) field lines and those
potentially accreting field lines that pass through the equatorial plane inside
the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We consider a series of models in which the
stellar magnetic field is opened up by the outward pressure of the hot coronal
gas at a range of radii. As this radius is increased, accretion takes place
along simpler field structures and impacts on fewer sites at the stellar
surface. This is consistent with the observed variation in the Ca II IRT and
HeI lines which suggests that accretion in the visible hemisphere is confined
to a single high-latitude spot. By determining the density and velocity of the
accretion flows, we find that in order to have most of the total mass accretion
rate impacting on a single high-latitude region we need disk material to
accrete from approximately 7R*, close to the Keplerian co-rotation radius at
6.8R*. We also calculate the coronal density and X-ray emission measure. We
find that both the magnitude and rotational modulation of the emission measure
increase as the source surface is increased. For the field structure of V2129
Oph which is dominantly octupolar, the emission forms a bright, high-latitude
ring that is always in view as the star rotates. Since the accretion funnels
are not dense enough to cause significant scattering of coronal X-ray photons,
they provide only a low rotational modulation of around 10% at most.

Universe. In this review, I intend to give a pedagogical discussion of some of
the related physics. Neutron stars exist because of Pauli's exclusion
principle, in two senses: 1) It makes it difficult to squeeze particles too
close together, in this way allowing a mechanical equilibrium state in the
presence of extremely strong gravity. 2) The occupation of low-energy proton
and electron states makes it impossible for low-energy neutrons to beta decay.
A corollary of the second statement is that charged particles are necessarily
present inside a neutron star, allowing currents to flow. Since these particles
are degenerate, they collide very little, and therefore make it possible for
the star to support strong, organized magnetic fields over long times. These
show themselves in pulsars and are the most likely energy source for the high
X-ray and gamma-ray luminosity ``magnetars''. I briefly discuss the possible
origin of this field and some physical constraints on its equilibrium
configurations.

these games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been
found to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width
measures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question
whether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber
without ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared
before. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been
studied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left
unresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and
lazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving
examples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching
games on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph
decompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have
partly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs
similar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for
undirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results
using tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success
might be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width. Unfortunately
the number of applications for the digraphs measures introduced so far is still
small. We therefore explore the limits of the algorithmic applicability of
digraph decompositions. In particular, we show that various natural candidates
for problems that might benefit from digraphs having small directed tree-width
remain NP-complete even on almost acyclic graphs.

Gaussian controls that characterize the additional singularity induced by the
degeneracy. We then give a local limit theorem with the usual convergence rate
for an associated Markov chain approximation. The key point is that the ""weak""
degeneracy allows to exploit the techniques first introduced by Konakov and

gravity we outline an approach to constrained dynamics that de-emphasizes the
role of the Hamiltonian phase space and highlights the role of the Lagrangian
phase space. We identify a ""Lagrangian one-form"" to replace the standard
symplectic one-form, which we use to construct the canonical constraints and an
associated constraint algebra. The method is particularly useful for generally
covariant systems and systems with a degenerate canonical symplectic form, such
as Einstein Cartan gravity, to which we apply the method explicitly. We find
that one can demonstrate the closure of the constraints without gauge fixing
the Lorentz group or introducing primary constraints on the phase space
variables. Finally, using geometric quantization techniques, we briefly discuss
implications of the formalism for the quantum theory.

one-dimensional periodic optical-lattice (OL) potentials after displacing the
harmonic trap along the axial OL axis. We study the dependence of Josephson
frequency on the strength of the OL potential. The Josephson frequency
decreases with increasing strength as found in the experiment of Cataliotti et
al. [Science 293 (2001) 843] for a Bose-Einstein condensate and of the
experiment of Pezze et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 120401] for an ideal

large displacement of the harmonic trap. These features of Josephson
oscillation of a SFG can be tested experimentally.

between $w(\tau)$ and other statistical transport quantities such as the noise

different direct converting sensor materials (CdZnTe and CdTe) bump bonded to
its 8x8 pixel matrix. Photon counting devices give excellent results for low to
medium X-ray fluxes but saturate at high rates while charge integration allows
the detection of very high fluxes but is limited at low rates by the finite
signal to noise ratio. The combination of both signal processing concepts
therefore extends the resolvable dynamic range of the X-ray detector. In
addition, for a large region of the dynamic range, where counter and integrator
operate simultaneously, the mean energy of the detected X-ray spectrum can be
calculated. This spectral information can be used to enhance the contrast of
the X-ray image. The advantages of the counting and integrating signal
processing concept and the performance of the imaging system will be reviewed.
The properties of the system with respect to dynamic range and sensor response
