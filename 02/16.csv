probing the epoch of reionization is motivating the construction of several
low-frequency interferometers. There is also much interest in the possibility
of constraining the initial conditions from inflation and the nature of the
dark matter and dark energy by probing the power-spectrum of density
perturbations in three dimensions and on smaller scales than probed by the
microwave background anisotropies. Theoretical understanding of the 21 cm
signal has been fragmented into different regimes of physical interest. In this
paper, we make the first attempt to describe the full redshift evolution of the
21 cm signal between 0<z<300.
  We include contributions to the 21 cm signal from fluctuations in the gas
density, temperature and neutral fraction, as well as the Lyman alpha flux, and
allow for a post-reionization signal from damped Ly alpha systems. Our
comprehensive analysis provides a useful foundation for optimizing the design
of future arrays whose goal is to separate the particle physics from the
astrophysics, either by probing the peculiar velocity distortion of the 21 cm
power spectrum, or by extending the 21 cm horizon to z > 25 before the first
galaxies had formed, or to z < 6 when the residual pockets of hydrogen trace
large scale structure.

discuss the observational determination of the globular cluster luminosity and

cluster system, and discuss how these constrain models of evaporation and the
dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The second subject of this review is
the question of how to account for the observed constancy of the globular
cluster mass function with distance from the center of the host galaxy. The
problem is that a radial trend is expected for isotropic cluster orbits, and
while the orbits are observed to be roughly isotropic, no radial trend in the
globular cluster system is observed. I review three extant proposals to account
for this, and discuss observations and calculations that might determine which
of these is most correct. The final subject is the origin of the very weak
mass-radius relation observed for globular clusters. I discuss how this
strongly constrains how globular clusters form and evolve. I also note that the
only viable current proposal to account for the observed weak mass-radius
relation naturally affects the globular cluster mass function, and that these
two problems may be related.

properties of calamitic liquid crystals across the isotropic-nematic phase
transition is carried out by calculating the {\it wavenumber (k) and time (t)}

simulations of model nematogens. The objective is to understand the
experimentally observed anomalies and sharp variation in many thermodynamic and
transport properties, namely specific heat $C$, sound attenuation coefficient
$\Gamma$, thermal diffusivity $D_T$ and sound velocity $c_s$ are as the I-N
transition is approached from the isotropic side. The small wavelength limit of
the calculated intermediate scattering function $F(k,t)$ is used to obtain the
ratio of specific heats $\gamma$ and other properties mentioned above. We find
that all of them show non-monotonic variations near the I-N transition, with
$\Gamma$ showing a cusp-like behavior. We suggest that the observed anomalous
features are a direct consequence of the existence of pseudo-nematic domains in
the system near the phase boundary and the melting and formation of such
domains give rise to sound attenuation and also to the observed specific heat
anomaly. A theoretical description of these anomalies should invoke
translation-rotation coupling at molecular level. While the heterogeneous
dynamics observed here bear resemblance to that in deeply supercooled liquids
near glass transition, the thermodynamic anomalies articulated here are largely

that includes a detailed model of chemical evolution, by assuming three
different shapes for the stellar initial mass function (IMF), namely the
Salpeter (1955), Kroupa (2001) and Arimoto-Yoshii (1987) IMF. Our simulations
predict significant radial gradients of the Iron abundance, which extend over
the whole cluster virialized region. At larger radii, we do not detect any
flattening of the metallicity profiles. As for the evolution of the ICM metal
(Iron) abundance out to z=1, we find that it is determined by the combined
action of (i) the sinking of already enriched gas, (ii) the ongoing metal
production in galaxies and (iii) the locking of ICM metals in newborn stars. As
a result, rather than suppressing the metallicity evolution, stopping star
formation at z=1 has the effect of producing an even too fast evolution of the
emission-weighted ICM metallicity with too high values at low redshift.
Finally, we compare simulations with the observed rate of type-Ia supernovae
per unit B-band luminosity (SnU_B). We find that our simulated clusters do not
reproduce the decreasing trend of SnU_B at low redshift, unless star formation
is truncated at z=1.

propose that pulsational displacements of stellar material modulate the pulsar
emission, but now we apply this modulation to a linearly-polarized mode of
emission, as might be produced by curvature radiation. We further introduce a
second polarization mode, orthogonal to the first, that is modulated by
pulsational velocities. We combine these modes in superposition to model the

These radial-velocity variations are not obviously consistent with radial
pulsation theory, given what we know about the masses and sizes of the

by tides (ellipsoidal variation) in both zeta Aur and 32 Cyg, at a level and
phasing roughly consistent with simple theory to first order, although they
seem to require moderately large gravity darkening. However, the K component of
32 Cyg must be considerably bigger than expected, or have larger gravity
darkening than zeta Aur, to fit its amplitude. However, again there is precious
little evidence for the normal radial pulsation of cool stars in our
photometry. H-alpha shows some evidence for chromospheric heating by the B
component in both zeta Aur and 32 Cyg, and the three stars show among them a
meager ~ 2--3 outbursts in their winds of the sort seen occasionally in cool

outbursts in multi-epoch imaging data; in contrast to the other SDSS AM CVn
discoveries, its (outburst) spectrum is dominated by helium absorption lines,

system at the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), specifically
designed to take advantage of the upgraded WSRT. The instrument is based on a
computer cluster running the Linux operating system, with minimal custom
hardware. A maximum of 160 MHz analogue bandwidth sampled as 8X20 MHz subbands
with 8-bit resolution can be recorded on disks attached to separate computer
nodes. Processing of the data is done in the additional 32-nodes allowing near
real time coherent dedispersion for most pulsars observed at the WSRT. This has
doubled the bandwidth for pulsar observations in general, and has enabled the
use of coherent dedispersion over a bandwidth eight times larger than was
previously possible at the WSRT. PuMa II is one of the widest bandwidth
coherent dedispersion machines currently in use and has a maximum time
resolution of 50ns. The system is now routinely used for high precision pulsar
timing studies, polarization studies, single pulse work and a variety of other
observational work.

a detection or just a sensitive measurement. Rather, the analysis establishes
mean (or median) values over the set of observed cores for relevant

Philips and Clegg in 1992 showed a markedly lower value for the line-of-sight
averaged turbulent intensity parameter $<C_N^2>$ than is observed for other
pulsars, consistent with radio wave propagation through a highly rarefied

interstellar magnetic field along these lines of sight are smaller than nominal
values for pulsars, but not by as much expected. Three of the four pulsars also
have measurements of interstellar scintillation. The value of the parameter
$<C_N^2>$ is smaller than normal for two of them, but is completely nominal for
the third. This inconclusive status of affairs could be improved by
measurements and analysis of ``arcs'' in ``secondary spectra'' of pulsars.

enough to resolve at $\la$1 kpc scales at 70 $\micron$ and 22 cm. We extend the
\citet{ejm06a,ejm06b} approach of smoothing infrared images to approximate
cosmic-ray (CR) electron spreading and thus largely reproduce the appearance of
radio images. Using a wavelet analysis we decompose each 70 $\micron$ image
into one component containing the star-forming {\it structures} and a second
one for the diffuse {\it disk}. The components are smoothed separately, and
their combination compared to a free-free corrected 22 cm radio image; the
scale-lengths are then varied to best match the radio and smoothed infrared
images. We find that late-type spirals having high amounts of ongoing star
formation benefit most from the two-component method. We also find that the
disk component dominates for galaxies having low star formation activity,
whereas the structure component dominates at high star formation activity. We
propose that this result arises from an age effect rather than from differences
in CR electron diffusion due to varying ISM parameters. The bulk of the CR
electron population in actively star-forming galaxies is significantly younger
than that in less active galaxies due to recent episodes of enhanced star
formation; these galaxies are observed within $\sim10^{8}$ yr since the onset
of the most recent star formation episode. The sample irregulars have
anomalously low best-fit scale-lengths for their surface brightnesses compared
to the rest of the sample spirals which we attribute to enhanced CR electron
escape.

correlation {\it within} normal galaxies, we use our infrared data to create
model radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. For 6 of our
sample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highly
deficient in the radio compared with our models. We believe these observations
are the signatures of ICM ram pressure. For NGC 4522 we find the radio deficit
region to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flat
radio spectral index, however the total radio continuum in this region does not
appear significantly enhanced. This scenario seems consistent for other
galaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. We also find that
galaxies having local radio deficits appear to have enhanced global radio
fluxes. Our preferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit
regions arise from the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the
associated magnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails observed for some
of our galaxies. CR particles are also re-accelerated by ICM-driven shocklets
behind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances the remaining
radio disk brightness. The high radio polarization and lack of coincidental
signatures in the total synchrotron power in these regions arises from shear,
and possibly mild compression, as the ICM wind drags and stretches the magnetic
field.

clusters as a function of cluster mass for 308 low-redshift clusters drawn from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) C4 cluster catalog. It is important to
establish if cluster star-formation properties have a mass dependence before
comparing clusters at different epochs, and here we use cluster velocity
dispersion as a measure of cluster mass. We find that the total stellar mass,
the number of star-forming galaxies, and total star-formation rate scale
linearly with the number of member galaxies, with no residual dependence on
cluster velocity dispersion. With the mass-dependence of cluster star-formation
rates established, we compare the SDSS clusters with a sample of z = 0.75
clusters from the literature and find that on average the total H-alpha
luminosity of the high-redshift clusters is 10 times greater than that of the
low-redshift clusters. This can be explained by a decline in the H-alpha
luminosities of individual cluster galaxies by a factor of up to 10 since z =
0.75. The magnitude of this evolution is comparable to that of field galaxies
over a similar redshift interval, and thus the effect of the cluster
environment on the evolution of star-forming galaxies is at most modest. Our
results suggest that the physical mechanism driving the evolution of cluster
star-formation rates is independent of cluster mass, at least for clusters with
velocity dispersion greater than 450 km/s, and operates over a fairly long
timescale such that the star-formation rates of individual galaxies decline by
an order of magnitude over ~7 billion years. (Abridged)

that the odd members of the Pfaff lattice hierarchy are trivial, while the even

of luminosity on size than would be predicted by a constant average column

distinct populations of AGNs, hosted respectively by elliptical and disk
galaxies. Both sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the
Eddington ratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests
that another parameter in addition to the accretion rate must play a role in
determining the efficiency of jet production in AGNs. We speculate that this
additional parameter is the spin of the black hole, assuming that black holes
in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average) much larger spins than black
holes in disc galaxies. Possible evolutionary scenarios leading to such a spin
dichotomy are discussed. The galaxy-morphology related radio-dichotomy breaks
down at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars
being hosted by giant ellipticals is radio quiet. This indicates that the
production of powerful jets at high accretion rates is in most cases suppressed
and, in analogy to X-ray binary systems (XRB) during high and very high states,
may be intermittent. Such intermittency can be caused by switches between two
different accretion modes, assuming that only during one of them an outflow
from the central engine is sufficiently collimated to form a relativistic jet.

quadrupole fields and off-centre dipoles. The simulations show that when the
quadrupole component is comparable to the dipole component, the magnetic field
has a complex structure with three major magnetic poles on the surface of the
star and three sets of loops of field lines connecting them. A significant
amount of matter flows to the quadrupole ""belt"", forming a ring-like hot spot
on the star. If the maximum strength of the magnetic field on the star is
fixed, then we observe that the mass accretion rate, the torque on the star,
and the area covered by hot spots are several times smaller in the
quadrupole-dominant cases than in the pure dipole cases. The influence of the
quadrupole component on the shape of the hot spots becomes noticeable when the
ratio of the quadrupole and dipole field strengths $B_q/B_d\gtrsim0.5$, and
becomes dominant when $B_q/B_d\gtrsim1$. In the case of an off-centre dipole
field, most of the matter flows through a one-armed accretion stream, forming a
large hot spot on the surface, with a second much smaller secondary spot. The
light curves may have simple, sinusoidal shapes, thus mimicking stars with pure
dipole fields. Or, they may be complex and unusual. In some cases the light
curves may be indicators of a complex field, in particular if the inclination
angle is known independently. We also note that in the case of complex fields,
magnetospheric gaps are often not empty, and this may be important for the

evolutionary effects for a wide range in metallicities and HB morphologies.
While our results show that ""pure"" period-luminosity and period-color relations
do not exist in the Stroemgren system, which is due to the large scatter that
is brought about by evolutionary effects when the uvby bandpasses are used,
they also reveal that such scatter can be almost completely taken into account
by incorporating Stroemgren pseudo-color [C_0 = (u-v)_0 - (v-b)_0] terms into
those equations, thus leading to tight period-luminosity-{\em pseudo}-color
(PLpsC) and period-color-{\em pseudo}-color (PCpsC) relations. We provide the
latter in the form of analytical fits, so that they can be applied with high
precision even in the case of field stars. In view of the very small
sensitivity of C_0 to interstellar reddening, our PLpsC and PCpsC relations
should be especially useful for the derivation of high-precision distance and
reddening values. In this sense, we carry out a first application of our
relations to field RR Lyrae stars, finding evidence that the stars RR Lyr, SU
Dra, and SS Leo -- but not SV Hya -- are somewhat overluminous (by amounts
ranging from ~0.05 to 0.20 mag in y, and thus V) with respect to the average

We find the derived north-south gradient perpendicular to the ecliptic plane is
oriented toward the Helioshperic Current Sheet (HCS) (i.e. southward in the
toward sector of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and northward in the
away sector). The orientation of the gradient component parallel to the
ecliptic plane remains similar in both sectors with an enhancement of its
magnitude seen after the Earth crosses the HCS. These temporal features are
interpreted in terms of a local maximum of the cosmic ray density at the HCS.
This is consistent with the prediction of the drift model for the $A<0$ epoch.
By comparing the observed gradient with the numerical prediction of a simple
drift model, we conclude that particle drifts in the large-scale magnetic field
play an important role in organizing the density gradient, at least in the
present $A<0$ epoch. We also found that corotating interaction regions did not
have such a notable effect. Observations with the GMDN provide us with a new
tool for investigating cosmic ray transport in the IMF.

new perspective. Rather than measuring distance induced by a norm, we focus on
the case when distance is meant in the sense of Bregman, i.e., induced by a
convex function. When the convex function has sufficiently nice properties,
then - analogously to the Euclidean distance case - every Klee set must be a

nanotubes with nearly identical diameters. In most cases the individual
nanotubes within a rope have different helicities and 1/3 of them are metallic.
In the absence of disorder within the tubes, the intertube electronic transfer
is negligeable because of the longitudinal wave vector mismatch between
neighboring tubes of different helicities. The rope can then be considered as a
number of parallel independent ballistic nanotubes. On the other hand, the
presence of disorder within the tubes favors the intertube electronic transfer.
This is first shown using a very simple model where disorder is treated
perturbatively inspired by the work in reference \cite{maarouf00}.
  We then present numerical simulations on a tight binding model of a rope.
Disorder induced transverse delocalisation shows up as a spectacular increase
of the sensitivity to the transverse boundary conditions in the presence of
small disorder. This is accompanied by an increase of the longitudinal
localisation length. Implications on the nature of electronic transport within
a rope of carbon nanotubes are discussed.
