electrons on the triangular lattice that interact through on-site repulsion $U$
as well as nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. This extended Hubbard model on a
triangular lattice has been studied mostly in the strong coupling limit for
only a few types of instabilities. Using the extended two-particle self
consistent approach (ETPSC), that is valid at weak to intermediate coupling, we
present an unbiased study of the density and interaction dependent crossover
diagram for spin and charge density wave instabilities of the normal state at
arbitrary wave vector. When $U$ dominates over $V$ and electron filling is
large, instabilities are chiefly in the spin sector and are controlled mostly
by Fermi surface properties. Increasing $V$ eventually leads to charge
instabilities. In the latter case, it is mostly the wave vector dependence of
the vertex that determines the wave vector of the instability rather than Fermi
surface properties. At small filling, non-trivial instabilities appear only
beyond the weak coupling limit. There again, charge density wave instabilities
are favored over a wide range of dopings by large $V$ at wave vectors
corresponding to $\sqrt(3) \times \sqrt(3)$ superlattice in real space.
Commensurate fillings do not play a special role for this instability.
Increasing $U$ leads to competition with ferromagnetism. At negative values of
$U$ or $V$, neglecting superconducting fluctuations, one finds that charge
instabilities are favored. In general, the crossover diagram presents a rich
variety of instabilities. We also show that thermal charge-density wave
fluctuations in the renormalized classical regime can open a pseudogap in the
single-particle spectral weight, just as spin or superconducting fluctuations.

universal throughout our sample and at different spatial scales. In addition,
the relative variations of the band ratios, as large as one order of magnitude,
are mainly controled by the fraction of ionized PAHs. In particular, I show
that we can rule out both the modification of the PAH size distribution and the
mid-IR extinction, as an explanation of these variations. High values of the

collection of gene trees. An important application of consensus methods is to
combine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical
properties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci
evolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees
from independent gene trees that occur in proportion to gene tree probabilities
derived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R*),
and greedy consensus trees constructed from known gene trees, both in the
asymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite
numbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species tree
branch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the
majority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved
and the greedy consensus tree less likely to match the species tree. However,
the probability that the R* consensus tree has the species tree topology
approaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches infinity. Although the
greedy consensus algorithm can be the quickest to converge on the correct
species tree when increasing the number of gene trees, it can also be
positively misleading. The majority-rule consensus tree is not a misleading
estimator of the species tree topology, and the R* consensus tree is a
statistically consistent estimator of the species tree topology. Our results
therefore suggest a method for using multiple loci to infer the species tree
topology, even when it is discordant with the most likely gene tree.

best-fit values of the parameters) and $z_{q=0}\sim 0.47-0.51$ (the
transitional redshift) for GTF as dark energy component only;
$k_0=0.21^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $\alpha=0.57\pm0.01$ and $z_{q=0}\sim 0.49-0.68$
for GTF as unification of dark energy and dark matter. In both cases, GTF
evolves like dark matter in the early universe. By applying model-comparison
statistics and test with independent $H(z)$ data, we find GTF dark energy
scenario is favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the $\Lambda$CDM model is
favored over GTF unified dark matter by the combined data. For GTF as dark
energy component, the fluctuations of matter density is consistent with the
growth of linear density perturbations. For GTF unified dark matter, the growth
of GTF density fluctuations grow more slowly for $a\to1$, meaning GTF do not
behave as classical $\Lambda$CDM scenarios.

than the Sun is hindered by their hot and rapidly spinning atmospheres. This
obstacle has been sidestepped by radial-velocity surveys of those stars on
their post-MS evolutionary track (G sub-giant and giant stars). Preliminary
observational findings suggest a deficiency of short-period hot Jupiters around
the observed post MS stars, although the total fraction of them with known
planets appears to increase with their mass. Here we consider the possibility
that some very close- in gas giants or a population of rocky planets may have
either undergone orbital decay or been engulfed by the expanding envelope of
their intermediate-mass host stars. If such events occur during or shortly
after those stars' main sequence evolution when their convection zone remains
relatively shallow, their surface metallicity can be significantly enhanced by
the consumption of one or more gas giants. We show that stars with enriched
veneer and lower-metallicity interior follow slightly modified evolution tracks
as those with the same high surface and interior metallicity. As an example, we
consider HD149026, a marginal post MS 1.3 Msun star. We suggest that its
observed high (nearly twice solar) metallicity may be confined to the surface
layer as a consequence of pollution by the accretion of either a planet similar
to its known 2.7-day-period Saturn-mass planet, which has a 70 Mearth compact
core, or a population of smaller mass planets with a comparable total amount of
heavy elements. It is shown that an enhancement in surface metallicity leads to
a reduction in effective temperature, in increase in radius and a net decrease
in luminosity. The effects of such an enhancement are not negligible in the
determinations of the planet's radius based on the transit light curves.

transmission rates for given locations of the source, relay and destination. We
introduce an alternative perspective, where the objective is maximizing
coverage for a given rate. The new objective captures the problem of how to
deploy relays to provide a given level of service to a particular geographic
area, where the relay locations become a design parameter that can be
optimized. We evaluate the decode and forward (DF) and compress and forward
(CF) strategies for the relay channel with respect to the new objective of
maximizing coverage. When the objective is maximizing rate, different locations
of the destination favor different strategies. When the objective is coverage
for a given rate, and the relay is able to decode, DF is uniformly superior in
that it provides coverage at any point served by CF. When the channel model is
modified to include random fading, we show that the monotone ordering of
coverage regions is not always maintained. While the coverage provided by DF is
sensitive to changes in the location of the relay and the path loss exponent,
CF exhibits a more graceful degradation with respect to such changes. The
techniques used to approximate coverage regions are new and may be of
independent interest.

contemporary Standard Model and its various generalizations. However, there is
no comprehensive theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We summarize the
relevant mathematical results characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking
phenomena in algebraic quantum theory, axiomatic quantum field theory, group
theory, and classical gauge theory.

investigated using a scanning nanoindenter. Gold exhibits over 10 times higher
wear rate in water compared to air at the same normal load of 10 microN. The
friction coefficient obtained from scratch tests remained constant at 0.2
regardless of the testing conditions. Au surface roughness increased from 3 to
8 nm after 200 wear cycles in air. Surface ripples, 200 nm high developed on
the Au film surface after 200 wear cycles in water. Film scratch hardness
compares well with the nanoindentation hardness.

the derivation rules in formal deduction of identities.
  The concept of essential variables and essential positions of terms with
respect to a set of identities is a key step in the simplification of the
process of formal deduction. $\Sigma-$composition of terms is defined as
replacement between $\Sigma$-equal terms. This composition induces $\Sigma
R-$deductively closed sets of identities. In analogy to balanced identities we
introduce and investigate $\Sigma-$balanced identities for a given set of
identities $\Sigma$.

and V bands to detect the optical counterpart of the associated pulsar
J0295+6449 and its torus-like wind nebula visible in X-rays. We analyzed our
data together with the archival data obtained with the Chandra in X-rays and
with the Spitzer in the mid-IR. We detect a faint extended elliptical object
with B=24.06 and V=23.11 whose peak brightness and center position are
consistent at the sub-arcsecond level with the position of the pulsar. Its
morphology and orientation are in excellent agreement with the torus-like
pulsar nebula, seen almost edge on in X-rays although its extension is only
about a half of that in X-rays. In the optical we likely see only the brightest
central part of the torus with the pulsar. The object is identical to the
counterpart of the torus recently detected in the mid-IR. The estimated pulsar
contribution to the optical flux is less than 10%. Combinig the optical/mid-IR
fluxes and X-ray power-law spectrum extracted from the spatial region
constrained by the optical/IR source extent we compile a tentative
multi-wavelength spectrum of the central part of the nebula. Within
uncertainties of the interstellar extinction it is reminiscent of either the
Crab or B0540-69 pulsar wind nebula spectra. The properties of the object
strongly suggest it to be the optical counterpart of the 3C 58 pulsar + its
wind nebula system, making 3C 58 the third member of such a class of the
torus-like systems identified in the optical and mid-IR.

$Y(n)\sim n^{-\delta}$, have been found in Au clusters sputtered from embedded
Au nanoparticles under swift heavy ion irradiation. For small clusters, below
12.5 nm in size, $\delta$ has been found to be 3/2, which can be rationalized
as occurring from a steady state aggregation process with size independent
aggregation. For larger clusters, a $\delta$ value of 7/2 is suggested, which
might come from a dynamical transition to another steady state where
aggregation and evaporation rates are size dependent. In the present case, the
observed decay exponents do not support any possibility of a thermodynamic
liquid-gas type phase transition taking place, resulting in cluster formation.
