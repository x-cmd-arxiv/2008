deepest and widest field achieving a limiting flux of m(g') = 26.4, with a sky
coverage of 3.0 square-degrees. This is the largest coverage of any other
Kuiper belt survey to this depth. We detect 72 objects, two of which have been
previously observed. We have improved the Bayesian maximum likelihood fitting
technique presented in Gladman et al. (1998) to account for calibration and sky
density variations and have used this to determine the luminosity function of
the Kuiper belt. Combining our detections with previous surveys, we find the
luminosity function is well represented by a single power-law with slope alpha
= 0.65 +/- 0.05 and an on ecliptic sky density of 1 object per square-degree
brighter than m(R)=23.42 +/- 0.13. Assuming constant albedos, this slope
suggests a differential size-distribution slope of 4.25 +/- 0.25, which is
steeper than the Dohnanyi slope of 3.5 expected if the belt is in a state of
collisional equilibrium. We find no evidence for a roll-over or knee in the
luminosity function and reject such models brightward of m(R) ~ 24.6.

"0802.2305","Ping Li","Ping Li","Compressed Counting",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS cs.LG math.IT",,"  Counting is among the most fundamental operations in computing. For example,
counting the pth frequency moment has been a very active area of research, in
theoretical computer science, databases, and data mining. When p=1, the task
(i.e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a simple counter.
  Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth
frequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if
the streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the
time t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile
model as a special case. For natural data streams encountered in practice, this
restriction is minor.
  The underly technique for CC is what we call skewed stable random
projections, which captures the intuition that, when p=1 a simple counter
suffices, and when p = 1+/\Delta with small \Delta, the sample complexity of a
counter system should be low (continuously as a function of \Delta). We show at
small \Delta the sample complexity (number of projections) k = O(1/\epsilon)
instead of O(1/\epsilon^2).
  Compressed Counting can serve a basic building block for other tasks in
statistics and computing, for example, estimation entropies of data streams,
parameter estimations using the method of moments and maximum likelihood.
  Finally, another contribution is an algorithm for approximating the
logarithmic norm, \sum_{i=1}^D\log A_t[i], and logarithmic distance. The
logarithmic distance is useful in machine learning practice with heavy-tailed
data.

contributes only 5% to the observed spin-phase averaged flux at 7500 A, 7.5% at

studied within a tight-binding description. At half filling, the NMR relaxation
rate follows a power law as $T^2$ on the particle-hole symmetric side, while
with a finite chemical potential $\mu$ and next-nearest neighbor $t'$, the
$(\mu+3t')^2$ terms dominate at low excess charge $\delta$. The static spin
susceptibility is linearly dependent on temperature $T$ at half filling when
$t'=0$, while with a finite $\mu$ and $t'$, it should be dominated by
$(\mu+3t')$ terms in low energy regime. These unusual phenomena are direct
results of the low energy excitations of graphene, which behave as massless
Dirac fermions. Furthermore, when $\delta$ is high enough, there is a
pronounced crossover which divides the temperature dependence of the NMR
relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility into two temperature
regimes: the NMR relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility increase
dramatically as temperature increases in the low temperature regime, and after
the crossover, both decrease as temperature increases at high temperatures.
This crossover is due to the well-known logarithmic Van Hove singularity in the
density of states, and its position dependence of temperature is sensitive to
$\delta$.

at finite density the color neutrality is missing because the Wilson line
serves as an external ``colored'' field coupled to dynamical quarks. In this
paper we heuristically assume that the model may still be applicable. To get
color neutrality one has then to allow non vanishing color chemical potentials.
We study how the quark matter phase diagram in $(T,m_s^2/\mu)$-plane is
affected by imposing neutrality and by including the Polyakov loop dynamics.
Although these two effects are correlated in a nonlinear way, the impact of the
Polyakov loop turns out to be significant in the $T$ direction, while imposing
neutrality brings a remarkable effect in the $m_s^2/\mu$ direction. In
particular, we find a novel unlocking transition, when the temperature is
increased, even in the chiral SU(3) limit. We clarify how and why this is
possible once the dynamics of the colored Polyakov loop is taken into account.

out and disperse over time. However, it is a remarkable phenomenon, observed

create degeneracy in the stability analysis. The theory is particularly
difficult in the \emph{critical} case in which the nonlinearity is at exactly
the right power to potentially allow for a self-similar blowup. In this article

universe, shedding light on elusive dark energy and gravity at cosmological
scales. BAO measurements through biased tracers of the underlying matter
density field, as most proposals do, can reach high statistical accuracy.
However, possible scale dependence in bias may induce non-negligible
systematical errors, especially for the most ambitious spectroscopic surveys
proposed. We show that precision spectroscopic redshift information available
in these surveys allows for {\it self calibration} of the galaxy bias and its
stochasticity, as function of scale and redshift. Through the effect of
redshift distortion, one can simultaneously measure the real space power
spectra of galaxies, galaxy-velocity and velocity, respectively. At relevant
scales of BAO, galaxy velocity faithfully traces that of the underlying matter.
This valuable feature enables a rather model independent way to measure the
galaxy bias and its stochasticity by comparing the three power spectra. For the
square kilometer array (SKA), this self calibration is statistically accurate
to correct for 1% level shift in BAO peak positions induced by bias scale
dependence. Furthermore, we find that SKA is able to detect BAO in the velocity
power spectrum, opening a new window for BAO cosmology.

2003, which occurred on 2006 December 13, is studied in terms of its solar
source and heliospheric consequences. The CME is accompanied by an X3.4 flare,
EUV dimmings and coronal waves. It generated significant space weather effects
such as an interplanetary shock, radio bursts, major solar energetic particle
(SEP) events, and a magnetic cloud (MC) detected by a fleet of spacecraft
including STEREO, ACE, Wind and Ulysses. Reconstruction of the MC with the
Grad-Shafranov (GS) method yields an axis orientation oblique to the flare
ribbons. Observations of the SEP intensities and anisotropies show that the
particles can be trapped, deflected and reaccelerated by the large-scale
transient structures. The CME-driven shock is observed at both the Earth and
Ulysses when they are separated by 74$^{\circ}$ in latitude and 117$^{\circ}$
in longitude, the largest shock extent ever detected. The ejecta seems missed
at Ulysses. The shock arrival time at Ulysses is well predicted by an MHD model
which can propagate the 1 AU data outward. The CME/shock is tracked remarkably
well from the Sun all the way to Ulysses by coronagraph images, type II
frequency drift, in situ measurements and the MHD model. These results reveal a
technique which combines MHD propagation of the solar wind and type II
emissions to predict the shock arrival time at the Earth, a significant advance
for space weather forecasting especially when in situ data are available from
the Solar Orbiter and Sentinels.

a real example (computation of the peak cladding temperature during a

(2007, henceforth Paper I) for studying the evolution of compact-binary
populations of globular clusters, introducing in this paper our method of
handling the stochasticity inherent in dynamical processes of binary formation,
destruction and hardening in globular clusters. We describe these stochastic
processes as ""Wiener processes"", whereupon the Boltzmann equation becomes a
stochastic partial differential equation, the solution of which requires the
use of ""Ito calculus"" (this use being the first, to our knowledge, in this
subject), in addition to ordinary calculus. We focus on the evolution of (a)
the number of X-ray binaries $N_{XB}$ in globular clusters, and (b) the
orbital-period distribution of these binaries. We show that, although the
details of the fluctuations in the above quantities differ from one
""realization"" to another of the stochastic processes, the general trends follow
those found in the continuous-limit study of Paper I, and the average result
over many such realizations is close to the continuous-limit result. We
investigate the dependence of $N_{XB}$ found by these calculations on two
essential globular-cluster parameters, namely, the star-star and star-binary
encounter-rate parameters $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$, for which we had coined the
name Verbunt parameters in Paper I. We compare our computed results with those
from CHANDRA observations of Galactic globular clusters, showing that the
expected scalings of $N_{XB}$ with the Verbunt parameters are in good agreement
with the observed ones. We indicate what additional features can be
incorporated into the scheme in future, and how more elaborate problems can be
tackled.

The
standard picture of Fermi liquids is first critically analyzed, pointing out
some of its rather peculiar properties. The insightful work of Ceperley in
constructing fermionic path integrals in terms of constrained world-lines is
then reviewed. In this representation, the minus signs associated with
Fermi-Dirac statistics are self consistently translated into a geometrical
constraint structure (the {\em nodal hypersurface}) acting on an effective
bosonic dynamics. As an illustrative example we use this formalism to study
1+1-dimensional systems, where statistics are irrelevant, and hence the sign
problem can be circumvented. In this low-dimensional example, the structure of
the nodal constraints leads to a lucid picture of the entropic interaction
essential to one-dimensional physics. Working with the path integral in
momentum space, we then show that the Fermi gas can be understood by analogy to
a Mott insulator in a harmonic trap. Going back to real space, we discuss the
topological properties of the nodal cells, and suggest a new holographic
conjecture relating Fermi liquids in higher dimensions to soft-core bosons in
one dimension. We also discuss some possible connections between mixed

via a short-range square-well attraction. We theoretically evaluate, solving
the Wertheim theory, the location of the critical point and the gas-liquid
coexistence line for several values of f and compare them to results of Gibbs
and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We study both ordered and
disordered arrangements of the sites on the hard-sphere surface and confirm
that patchiness has a strong effect on the phase diagram: the gas-liquid
coexistence region in the temperature-density plane is significantly reduced as
f decreases. We also theoretically evaluate the locus of specific heat maxima
and the percolation line.

Ia) are currently accepted, in which a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD)
accretes hydrogen-rich material from its companion, increases its mass to the
Chandrasekhar mass limit, and then explodes as a SN Ia. Incorporating the
prescription of \citet{HAC99a} for the accretion efficiency into Eggleton's
stellar evolution code and assuming that the prescription is valid for
\emph{all} metallicities, we performed binary stellar evolution calculations
for more than 25,000 close WD binaries with metallicities $Z=0.06, 0.05, 0.04,
0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.004, 0.001, 0.0003$ and 0.0001. For our calculations, the
companions are assumed to be unevolved or slightly evolved stars (WD + MS). As
a result, the initial parameter spaces for SNe Ia at various $Z$ are presented
in orbital period-secondary mass ($\log P_{\rm i}, M_{\rm 2}^{\rm i}$) planes.
Our study shows that both the initial mass of the secondary and the initial
orbital period increase with metallicity. Thus, the minimum mass of the CO WD
for SNe Ia decreases with metallicity $Z$. The difference of the minimum mass
may be as large as 0.24 $M_{\odot}$ for different Z.
  Adopting the results above, we studied the birth rate of SNe Ia for various
$Z$ via a binary population synthesis approach. If a single starburst is
assumed, SNe Ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birth rate
is larger for a high $Z$. The Galactic birth rate from the WD + MS channel is
lower than (but comparable to) that inferred from observations. Our study
indicates that supernovae like SN2002ic would not occur in extremely
low-metallicity environments, if the delayed dynamical-instability model in
\citet{HAN06} is appropriate.

of strongly enhanced and slow spin fluctuations at $q \sim Q_c \simeq$ 0.6

SCR theory is more reliable, the observed temperature variations of the static
spin susceptibility $\chi(Q_c;T)$ and the relaxation rate $\Gamma_Q(T)$ at
$q\sim Q_c$ are well reproduced by those suggested by the theory. For $T\gtrsim

have temperatures from 10 000 K (the low temperature limit of our observations)

blending of the observed coronal line Mg X 624.85 A. The duration of the events
ranges from 60 s to 19 min depending on the loop size. Some of the flows reach
supersonic velocities. The Doppler shifts often associated with explosive
events or bi-directional jets can actually be identified with flows (some of
them reaching supersonic velocities) in small-scale loops. Additionally, we
demonstrate how a line-of-sight effect can give misleading information on the

The block-spin transformation they use maps the chiral and vector symmetries of
the underlying vector theory onto two equations of the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW)
type. We show that an overlap Dirac operator can be constructed which solves
both GW equations simultaneously. We discuss the properties of this overlap
operator and its projection onto lattice Weyl fermions which seems to be free
of artefacts, in particular the projection operators are independent of the
gauge field.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a compressible fluid layer with and without a
weak magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, the instability
generates a single eddy which flattens the velocity profile, stabilizing it
against further perturbations. Adding a weak magnetic field - weak in the sense
that it has almost no effect on the linear instability - leads to a complex
flow morphology driven by MHD forces and to enhanced broadening of the layer,
due to Maxwell stresses. We corroborate earlier studies which showed that
magnetic fields destroy the large scale eddy structure through periodic cycles
of windup and resistive decay, but we show that the rate of decay decreases
with decreasing plasma resistivity, at least within the range of resistivity
accessible to our simulations. Magnetization increases the efficiency of
momentum transport, and the transport increases with decreasing resistivity.

superlattice potential with disorder using the time evolving block decimation
algorithm for infinite sized systems (iTEBD). For degenerate potential energies
within the unit cell of the superlattice loophole-shaped insulating phases with
non-integer filling emerge with a particle-hole gap proportional to the boson
hopping. Adding a small amount of disorder destroys this gap. For not too large
disorder the loophole Mott regions detach from the axis of vanishing hopping
giving rise to insulating islands. Thus the system shows a transition from a
compressible Bose-glass to a Mott-insulating phase with increasing hopping
amplitude. We present a straight forward effective model for the dynamics
within a unit cell which provides a simple explanation for the emergence of
Mott-insulating islands. In particular it gives rather accurate predictions for
the inner critical point of the Bose-glass to Mott-insulator transition.

Jupiter-sized planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. We limit ourselves to
the case of outward migration, and study in detail its evolution and physics,
concentrating on the structure of the co-rotation and circumplanetary regions,
and processes for stopping migration. We also consider the dependence of the
migration behaviour on several key parameters. We perform this study using
global, two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with adaptive mesh
refinement. We find that the outward directed type III migration can be started
if the initial conditions support $Z > 1$, that corresponds to initial value
$M_\rmn{\Delta} \ga 1.5$. Unlike the inward directed migration, in the outward
migration the migration rate increases due to the growing of the volume of the
co-orbital region. We find the migration to be strongly dependent on the rate
of the mass accumulation in the circumplanetary disc, leading to two possible
regimes of migration, fast and slow. The structure of the co-orbital region and
the stopping mechanism differ between these two regimes.

disordered systems is obtained through a strong disorder renormalization
procedure in {\it configuration space}, that we define for any master equation
with transitions rates $W ({\cal C} \to {\cal C}')$ between configurations. The
idea is to eliminate iteratively the configuration with the highest exit rate
$W_{out} ({\cal C})= \sum_{{\cal C}'} W ({\cal C} \to {\cal C}')$ to obtain
renormalized transition rates between the remaining configurations. The
multiplicative structure of the new generated transition rates suggests that,
for a very broad class of disordered systems, the distribution of renormalized
exit barriers defined as $B_{out} ({\cal C}) \equiv - \ln W_{out}({\cal C})$
will become broader and broader upon iteration, so that the strong disorder
renormalization procedure should become asymptotically exact at large time
scales. We have checked numerically this scenario for the non-equilibrium
dynamics of a directed polymer in a two dimensional random medium.

cause the observed island formation in O/Pt(111), but it may be important for
many other systems as well.

many working physicists. In particular, interest has come from those involved
in quantum computing and information theory, as there has always been a strong
foundational element in this field. This paper introduces one interpretation of
quantum mechanics, a modern `many-worlds' theory, from the perspective of
quantum computation. Reasons for seeking to interpret quantum mechanics are
discussed, then the specific `neo-Everettian' theory is introduced and its
claim as the best available interpretation defended. The main objections to the
interpretation, including the so-called ``problem of probability'' are shown to
fail. The local nature of the interpretation is demonstrated, and the
implications of this both for the interpretation and for quantum mechanics more
generally are discussed. Finally, the consequences of the theory for quantum
computation are investigated, and common objections to using many worlds to
describe quantum computing are answered. We find that using this particular
many-worlds theory as a physical foundation for quantum computation gives
several distinct advantages over other interpretations, and over not
interpreting quantum theory at all.

that the influence of sort wavelength roughness, which is expressed by the
roughness exponent H for the case of self-affine roughness, plays significant
role in comparison with the effect of the long wavelength roughness parameters
such as the rms roughness amplitude and the lateral roughness correlation
length. Therefore, the surface morphology can play important role in designing
high-frequency resonators operating within the non-Newtonian regime.
