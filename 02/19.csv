gravitational black-hole that in its near-horizon approximation better
simulates this hadronic phenomenon. To identify such a black-hole we begin our
gravity-gauge theory phenomenologies matching by asking the question: which
black-hole behind that Rindler horizon could reproduce the experimental
behavior of T_f (\sqrt{s}) in N N', where \sqrt{s} is the collision energy.
Provided certain natural assumptions hold, we show that the exact string
black-hole turns out to be the best candidate (as it fits the available data on
T_f (\sqrt{s})) and that its limiting case, the Witten black-hole, is the
unique candidate to explain the constant T_f for all elementary scattering
processes at large energy. We also are able to propose an effective description
of the screening of the hadronic string tension sigma(mu_b) due to the baryon

neutrino flux may be used to constrain the source model if one assumes that the
ratio between the UHECR and neutrino fluxes outputted by Cen A is
representative for other sources. Under this assumption we investigate the
relation between the neutrino flux from Cen A and the diffuse neutrino flux.
Assuming furthermore that Cen A is the source of two UHECR events observed by
PAO, we estimate the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux to be ~200-5000 times larger
than the neutrino flux from Cen A. As a result, the diffuse neutrino fluxes
associated with some of the recently proposed models of UHECR-related neutrino
production in Cen A are above existing limits. Regardless of the underlying
source model, our results indicate that the detection of neutrinos from Cen A
without the accompanying diffuse flux would mean that Cen A is an exceptionally

multiprocessor scheduling under uncertainty, or SUU, in which the execution of
each job may fail probabilistically. This problem is motivated by the
increasing use of distributed computing to handle large, computationally
intensive tasks. In the SUU problem we are given n unit-length jobs and m
machines, a directed acyclic graph G of precedence constraints among jobs, and
unrelated failure probabilities q_{ij} for each job j when executed on machine
i for a single timestep. Our goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the
expected makespan, which is the expected time at which all jobs complete.
  Lin and Rajaraman gave the first approximations for this NP-hard problem for
the special cases of independent jobs, precedence constraints forming disjoint
chains, and precedence constraints forming trees. In this paper, we present
asymptotically better approximation algorithms. In particular, we give an
O(loglog min(m,n))-approximation for independent jobs (improving on the
previously best O(log n)-approximation). We also give an O(log(n+m) loglog
min(m,n))-approximation algorithm for precedence constraints that form disjoint

O(log(n)log(m)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation by a (log n/loglog n)^2

chains can also be used as a component for precedence constraints forming
trees, yielding a similar improvement over the previously best algorithms for

A1689-zD1, shows a strong z-J break of at least 2.2 mag and is completely
undetected (<1 sigma) in HST/ACS g, r, i, and z-band data. These properties,
combined with the very blue J-H and H-[4.5] colors, are exactly the properties
of an z~7.6 LBG and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy at
z=7.6 +/- 0.4. Attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy at
z<4 yield particularly poor fits. A1689-zD1 has an observed (lensed) magnitude
of 24.7 AB (8 sigma) in the NICMOS H band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than the
brightest-known z-dropout galaxy. When corrected for the cluster magnification
of 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of H=27.1 AB, or
about an L* galaxy at z~7.6. The source-plane deprojection shows that the star
formation is occurring in compact knots of size ~<300 pc. The best-fit stellar
population synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses

similar to those of LBGs found at z~5-6. The inferred stellar ages suggest a
formation redshift of z~8-10 (t~<0.63 Gyr). A1689-zD1 is the brightest

existence of stable network activations within a limited critical range. In
this range, the activity of neural populations in the network persists between
the extremes of quickly dying out, or activating the whole network. The nerve
fiber network of the mammalian cerebral cortex possesses a modular organization
extending across several levels of organization. Using a basic spreading model
without inhibition, we investigated how functional activations of nodes
propagate through such a hierarchically clustered network. The simulations
demonstrated that persistent and scalable activation could be produced in
clustered networks, but not in random networks of the same size. Moreover, the
parameter range yielding critical activations was substantially larger in
hierarchical cluster networks than in small-world networks of the same size.
These findings indicate that a hierarchical cluster architecture may provide

in the most general potential of such a scenario, in order to avoid a massless
neutral physical scalar. We also demonstrate that $\azero$ must be real, thus
ruling out any additional source of CP-violation. We then examine the
implications of this term in the mass matrices of the singly-and doubly-charged
scalar, neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fields. We find that, for small values
of $\azero/\vtwo$, where $\vtwo$ is the triplet vev, the spectrum allows the
decay of heavier scalars into lighter ones via gauge interactions. For large
$\azero/\vtwo$, the doubly-charged, singly-charged and neutral pseudoscalar
bosons become practically degenerate, while the even-parity neutral scalars
remain considerably lighter, thus emphasizing the possibility of decay of the
singly-charged or neutral pseudoscalar states into the neutral scalars.
Constraints from the $\rho$-parameter are used to find nontrivial limits on the
charged Higgs mass depending on $\azero$. We also study the couplings of the
various physical states in this scenario. For small values of $|\azero|/\vtwo$,
we find the lightest neutral scalar field to be triplet-dominated, and thus
having extremely suppressed interactions with fermion as well as gauge boson

connectivity being higher than in comparable random networks. However, the
standard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a
node has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally
been set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient.
Such a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in
sparse networks. We propose to include $\theta$ as the proportion of leafs and
isolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a
formula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the
Watts and Strogatz (1998 Nature 393 440-2) definition of the clustering
coefficient. Excluding leafs and isolated nodes leads to values which are up to
140% higher than the traditional values for the observed networks indicating
that neighborhood connectivity is normally underestimated. We find that the
definition of the clustering coefficient has a major effect when comparing
different networks. For metabolic networks of 43 organisms, relations changed
for 58% of the comparisons when a different definition was applied. We also
show that the definition influences small-world features and that the
classification can change from non-small-world to small-world network. We
discuss the use of an alternative measure, disconnectedness D, which is less
influenced by leafs and isolated nodes.

$\phi(\cdot-\xi)$, $\xi\in\Xi\subset \Rd$, of a fixed function $\phi$ occurs in
many applications such as data fitting, neural networks, and learning theory.
When $\Xi=h\Z^d$ is a dilate of the integer lattice, there is a rather complete
understanding of the approximation problem \cite{BDR,Johnson1} using Fourier
techniques. However, in most applications the {\it center} set $\Xi$ is either
given, or can be chosen with complete freedom. In both of these cases, the
shift-invariant setting is too restrictive. This paper studies the
approximation problem in the case $\Xi$ is arbitrary. It establishes
approximation theorems whose error bounds reflect the local density of the
points in $\Xi$. Two different settings are analyzed. The first is when the set
$\Xi$ is prescribed in advance. In this case, the theorems of this paper show
that, in analogy with the classical univariate spline approximation, improved
approximation occurs in regions where the density is high. The second setting
corresponds to the problem of non-linear approximation. In that setting the set
$\Xi$ can be chosen using information about the target function $f$. We discuss
how to `best' make these choices and give estimates for the approximation
error.

several cellular processes, including differentiation and long-term synaptic
potentiation. A recent model (48) predicts bistability due to interactions of
the kinases and phosphatases in the MAPK pathway, without feedback from MAPK to
earlier reactions. Using this model and enzyme concentrations appropriate for
neurons, we simulated bistable MAPK activity, but bistability only was present
within a relatively narrow range of activity of Raf, the first pathway kinase.
Stochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers eliminated bistability for small
molecule numbers, such as are expected in the volume of a dendritic spine.
However, positive feedback loops have been posited from MAPK up to Raf
activation. One proposed loop in which MAPK directly activates Raf was
incorporated into the model. We found that such feedback greatly enhanced the
robustness of both stable states of MAPK activity to stochastic fluctuations
and to parameter variations. Bistability was robust for molecule numbers
plausible for a dendritic spine volume. The upper state of MAPK activity was
resistant to inhibition of MEK activation for > 1 h, suggesting inhibitor
experiments have not sufficed to rule out a role for persistent MAPK activity
in LTP maintenance. These simulations suggest that persistent MAPK activity and
consequent upregulation of translation may contribute to LTP maintenance and to
long-term memory. Experiments using a fluorescent MAPK substrate may further
test this hypothesis.

of low density ($\sim 10^3 \pcc$) cool ($\sim 10^3$ K) gas surrounded by
significant amounts of cosmic-ray and magnetic-field energy. Their spectra show
anomalously strong low-ionization and molecular emission lines when compared
with galactic molecular clouds exposed to ionizing radiation such as the Orion
complex. Previous studies have shown that the spectra cannot be produced by
O-star photoionization. Here we calculate the physical conditions in dusty gas
that is well shielded from external sources of ionizing photons and is
energized either by cosmic rays or dissipative MHD waves. Strong molecular
hydrogen lines, with relative intensities similar to those observed, are
produced. Selection effects introduced by the microphysics produce a
correlation between the \htwo line upper level energy and the population
temperature. These selection effects allow a purely collisional gas to produce
\htwo emission that masquerades as starlight-pumped \htwo but with intensities
that are far stronger. This physics may find application to any environment
where a broad range of gas densities or heating rates occur.

open several important possibilities : a weaker Lorentz breaking, a fundamental
scale beyond the Planck scale, scenarios with threshold effects... It may even
happen that spontaneous decays due to LSV fake the GZK cutoff. Space

conducting plates of large extent with a homogeneous and isotropic medium

nondissipative. The presence of dispersion means that the energy density
contains terms of the form $d[\omega\epsilon(\omega)] /d\omega$ and
$d[\omega\mu(\omega)] /d\omega$. We find that, as $W_{\rm disp}$ refers
thermodynamically to a non-closed physical system, it is {\it not} to be
identified with the internal thermodynamic energy $U$ following from the free

this conclusion, we adopt a model in which the system is a capacitor, linked to
an external self-inductance $L$ such that stationary oscillations become
possible. Therewith the model system becomes a non-closed one. As an
introductory step, we review the meaning of the nondispersive energies, $F, U,$

known in closed form, contrary to the exact solution. The single HF orbital
involved has thus far been studied using expansion techniques only, leading to
slightly disparate energies. Therefore, the present letter aims at proposing
alternative definitions of the HF wavefunction. First, the HF limit is
ascertained using a simple expansion, which makes it possible to formulate
explicit expressions of HF properties. The resulting energy, 2.038 438 871 8
Eh, is found stable at the tenth digit. Second and more instructive, an
analysis of the Hartree equation makes it possible to infer a remarkably simple
and accurate HF orbital, leading to an energy exceeding by 5.76 10-7 Eh only
the above HF limit. This orbital makes it possible to obtain (near)
Hartree-Fock properties in closed-form, which in turn enables handy comparisons
with exact quantities.

relativistic jets and shocks e.g. gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) and microquasars commonly exhibit power-law emission spectra.
Recent PIC simulations of relativistic electron-ion (or electron-positron) jets
injected into a stationary medium show that particle acceleration occurs within
the downstream jet. In collisionless relativistic shocks particle (electron,
positron and ion) acceleration is due to plasma waves and their associated
instabilities (e.g. the Weibel (filamentation) instability) created in the
shock region. The simulations show that the Weibel instability is responsible
for generating and amplifying highly non-uniform small-scale magnetic fields.
These fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the jet
head. The resulting ``jitter'' radiation from deflected electrons has different
properties compared to synchrotron radiation which assumes a uniform magnetic
field. Jitter radiation may be important for understanding the complex time
evolution and/or spectra in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets in general and
supernova remnants.

The Higgs
fields and the supersymmetry breaking field are localized in the same place in

supersymmetry breaking parameters then receive the same suppression factors
from the wavefunction profiles of the matter fields, leading to a specific
correlation between these two classes of interactions. The resulting
phenomenology is very rich, while stringent experimental constraints from the
low-energy flavor and CP violating processes can all be satisfied. We construct
both unified and non-unified models in this framework, which can be either
strongly or weakly coupled at the cutoff scale. We analyze one version in

supersymmetric grand unification. The models presented here provide an explicit
example in which the supersymmetry breaking spectrum can be a direct window
into the physics of flavor at a very high energy scale.

Schrodinger equation with the body-centred cubic periodic symmetry condition,
the paper deduces a full baryon spectrum (including mass M, I, S, C, B, Q, J

are completely consistent with the corresponding experimental results. The
deduced masses of all 116 baryons agree with (more than average 98 percent) the
experimental baryon masses using only four constant parameters. The
body-centred cubic periodic symmetries with a periodic constant ``a'' about
$10^{-23}$m play a crucial rule. The results strongly suggest that the new
symmetries really exist. This paper predicts some kind of ``Zeeman effect'' of

the so-called art gallery problem. The goal is to compute the minimum possible
number guards placed on the vertices of a simple polygon in such a way that
they cover the interior of the polygon.
  In this paper we consider the problem of guarding an art gallery which is
modeled as a polygon with curvilinear walls. Our main focus is on polygons the
edges of which are convex arcs pointing towards the exterior or interior of the
polygon (but not both), named piecewise-convex and piecewise-concave polygons.
We prove that, in the case of piecewise-convex polygons, if we only allow
vertex guards, $\lfloor\frac{4n}{7}\rfloor-1$ guards are sometimes necessary,
and $\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor$ guards are always sufficient. Moreover, an
$O(n\log{}n)$ time and O(n) space algorithm is described that produces a vertex
guarding set of size at most $\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor$. When we allow point
guards the afore-mentioned lower bound drops down to
$\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. In the special case of monotone piecewise-convex
polygons we can show that $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ vertex guards are always
sufficient and sometimes necessary; these bounds remain valid even if we allow
point guards.
  In the case of piecewise-concave polygons, we show that $2n-4$ point guards
are always sufficient and sometimes necessary, whereas it might not be possible
to guard such polygons by vertex guards. We conclude with bounds for other
types of curvilinear polygons and future work.

separating two relativistic magnetized flows in relative motion. The two flows
are governed by the (special) relativistic equations for a magnetized perfect
gas in the infinite conductivity approximation. By adopting the vortex-sheet
approximation, the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations are linearized
around the equilibrium state and the corresponding dispersion relation is
derived and discussed. The behavior of the configuration and the regimes of
instability are investigated following the effects of four physical parameters,
namely: the flow velocity, the relativistic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers and the
inclination of the wave vector on the plane of the interface. From the
numerical solution of the dispersion relation, we find in general two separate
regions of instability, associated respectively with the slow and fast
magnetosonic modes. Modes parallel to the flow velocity are destabilized only
for sufficiently low magnetization. For the latter case, stabilization is
attained, additionally, at sufficiently large relativistic velocities between
the two flows in relative motion. The relevance of these results to the study
of the stability of astrophysical jets is briefly commented.

and theoretical interest. Experimental information for nuclei in the vicinity
of 132Sn, which have been long inaccessible to spectroscopic studies, is now
available thanks to new advanced facilities and techniques. The experimental
data which have been now become available for these neutron-rich nuclei may
suggest a modification in the shell structure. They are, in fact, somewhat
different from what one might expect by extrapolating the existing results for
N<82, and as a possible explanation a change in the single-proton level scheme
has been suggested. The latter would be caused by a more diffuse nuclear
surface, and could be seen as a precursor of major effects which should show up
at larger neutron excess. New data offer therefore the opportunity to test the
shell model and look for a possible evolution of shell structure when going
toward neutron drip line. This is stimulating shell-model studies in this
region. Here, we present an overview of recent shell-model studies of 132Sn
neighbors, focusing attention on those calculations employing realistic
effective interactions.

Contrary to previous reports, in the overdoped (OD) regime we do find a
variation of Tc with increasing the oxygen partial-pressure of the
post-annealing treatment. This variation is less significant than in the
bi-layer parental compound Bi-2212 and does not follow the universal Tc
vs.delta relation. Magnetic measurements reveal that increasing delta enlarges
the field and temperature stability of the Bragg glass phase. These findings
imply that the interlayer coupling between Cu-O layers enhances with delta. The
anisotropy parameter estimated from directional first-penetration field
measurements monotonously decreases from 50 in the underdoped (UD) to 15 in the
OD regimes. However, the in-plane penetration depth presents a boomerang-like
behaviour with $\delta$, reaching its minimum value close to optimal doping.
These two facts lead to a crossover from a Josephson(OD) to
electromagnetic(UD)-dominated coupling of adjacent Cu-O layers in the vicinity

Its identification with Li I remains controversial due to a poor knowledge of
the spectra of rare-earth elements that are strongly enhanced in peculiar stars
and can potentially provide an alternative identification. We suggest to
investigate the 6708 line in Ap stars with strong magnetic fields. In these
objects the magnetic broadening and splitting provides an additional powerful
criterium for line identification, allowing to use the whole line profile
instead of a mere coincidence of the observed and predicted wavelength. Due to
a small separation of the Li I doublet components, their magnetic splitting
pattern deviates from the one expected for the Zeeman effect even in relatively
weak fields. We carry out detailed calculations of the transition between the
Zeeman and Paschen-Back regimes in the magnetic splitting of the Li I line and
compute polarized synthetic spectra for the range of field strength expected in
Ap stars. Theoretical spectral synthesis is compared with the high-resolution
observations of cool Ap stars HD 116114, HD 166473 and HD 154708, which have a
mean field strength of 6.4, 8.6 and 24.5 kG, respectively, and show a strong
6708 A line. High-resolution spectra for the 6708 A region are analysed for 17
magnetic Ap stars. The presence of the 6708 A line is confirmed in 9 stars and
reported for the first time in 6 stars. We demonstrate that the observed
profiles of the 6708 A line in the strong field stars HD 116114, HD 166473 and
HD 154708 correspond rather well to the theoretical calculations assuming the
Li I identification. Inclusion of the Paschen-Back effect improves the
agreement with observations, especially for HD 154708. Results of our study

Green's function of the energy operator with a blackbody-like seed photon
spectrum. When combined thermal and bulk effects are considered, the analytic
form of the Green's function may be obtained as a solution of the diffusion

sources believed to host a magnetar, i.e. an ultra-magnetized neutron star.
Their persistent, soft X-ray emission (~1-10 keV)is usually modeled by the
superposition of a blackbody and a power-law tail. It has been suggested that
this spectrum forms as the thermal photons emitted by the star surface traverse
the magnetosphere. Magnetar magnetospheres are likely different from those of
ordinary radio-pulsars, since the external magnetic field may acquire a
toroidal component as a consequence of the deformation of the star crust
induced by the super-strong interior field. In turn, the magnetosphere will be
permeated by currents that can boost primary photons through repeated
scatterings. Here we present 3D Monte Carlo simulations of photon propagation
in a twisted magnetosphere. Our model is based on a simplified treatment of the
charge carriers velocity distribution which, however, accounts for the particle
collective motion, in addition to the thermal one. Present treatment is
restricted to conservative (Thomson) scattering in the electron rest frame. The
code, nonetheless, is completely general and inclusion of the relativistic QED
resonant cross section, which is required in the modeling of the hard (~20-200
keV) spectral tails observed in the magnetar candidates, is under way. The
properties of emerging spectra have been assessed under different conditions,
by exploring the model parameter space, including effects arising from the
viewing geometry. Monte Carlo runs have been collected into a spectral archive.
Two tabulated XSPEC spectral models, with and without viewing angles, have been

(RQRPA) is extended by the quasiparticle-phonon coupling (QPC) model using the
Quasiparticle Time Blocking Approximation (QTBA). The method is formulated in
terms of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the two-quasiparticle space with
an energy-dependent two-quasiparticle residual interaction. This equation is
solved either in the basis of Dirac states forming the self-consistent solution
of the ground state or in the momentum representation. Pairing correlations are
treated within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model with a
monopole-monopole interaction. The same NL3 set of the coupling constants
generates the Dirac-Hartree-BCS single-quasiparticle spectrum, the static part
of the residual two-quasiparticle interaction and the quasiparticle-phonon
coupling amplitudes. A quantitative description of electric dipole excitations
in the chain of tin isotopes (Z=50) with the mass numbers A = 100, 106, 114,
116, 120, and 130 and in the chain of isotones with (N=50) 88-Sr, 90-Zr, 92-Mo
is performed within this framework.
  The RQRPA extended by the coupling to collective vibrations generates spectra
with a multitude of '2q+phonon' (two quasiparticles plus phonon) states
providing a noticeable fragmentation of the giant dipole resonance as well as
of the soft dipole mode (pygmy resonance) in the nuclei under investigation.
The results obtained for the photo absorption cross sections and for the
integrated contributions of the low-lying strength to the calculated dipole
spectra agree very well with the available experimental data.

the possibilities and limitations of forecasters that perform an on-line
exploration of the arms. These forecasters are assessed in terms of their
simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only
constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in
advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and
when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this
performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm
is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links
between the simple and the cumulative regret. One of the main results in the
case of a finite number of arms is a general lower bound on the simple regret
of a forecaster in terms of its cumulative regret: the smaller the latter, the
larger the former. Keeping this result in mind, we then exhibit upper bounds on
the simple regret of some forecasters. The paper ends with a study devoted to
continuous-armed bandit problems; we show that the simple regret can be
minimized with respect to a family of probability distributions if and only if
the cumulative regret can be minimized for it. Based on this equivalence, we
are able to prove that the separable metric spaces are exactly the metric
spaces on which these regrets can be minimized with respect to the family of
all probability distributions with continuous mean-payoff functions.

two papers that discuss the prototype polar AM Her in detail and summarize the
class properties of all other polars. We derive the high-state soft X-ray flux

best-fit mean single-blackbody temperature and integrated bright-phase energy
flux of AM Her in its April 1991 high state are 27.2 +/- 1.0 eV and (2.6 +/-

multi-temperature model that fits both the soft X-ray and the fluctuating

hard diffuse emission whose origin has been strongly debated for the past two
decades: does this emission result from the contribution of numerous, yet
unresolved, discrete point sources ? Or does it originate in a truly diffuse,
hot plasma ?
  The Galactic center region (GC) is however different on many respects from
the outer parts of the Galaxy, which makes the diffuse emission issue at the
Galactic center unique. Although recent observations seem to favour a point
sources origin in the far Galactic ridge, the situation is still unclear at the
GC and new observations are required.
  Here we present results on the modeling of the truly diffuse plasma.
Interestingly, such a plasma would strongly affect the dynamics of orbiting
molecular clouds and thus the central engine activity. Discriminating between
the two hypothesis has thus become a crucial issue in the understanding of this
central region that makes the link between the inner small accretion disk and
the large scale Galactic dynamics. We investigate the new inputs we can expect

Laplace operator on a point cloud. Desirable are positive stencils, i.e. all
neighbor entries are of the same sign. Classical least squares approaches yield
large stencils that are in general not positive. We present an approach that
yields stencils of minimal size, which are positive. We provide conditions on
the point cloud geometry, so that positive stencils always exist. The new
discretization method is compared to least squares approaches in terms of
accuracy and computational performance.

  2655-2671",,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  This work is concerned with the estimation of multidimensional regression and
the asymptotic behaviour of the test involved in selecting models. The main
problem with such models is that we need to know the covariance matrix of the
noise to get an optimal estimator. We show in this paper that if we choose to
minimise the logarithm of the determinant of the empirical error covariance
matrix, then we get an asymptotically optimal estimator. Moreover, under
suitable assumptions, we show that this cost function leads to a very simple
asymptotic law for testing the number of parameters of an identifiable and
regular regression model. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
results.

L1527 IRS (IRAS 04368+2557) to provide constraints on its protostellar envelope
structure. The nearly edge-on inclination of L1527 IRS, coupled with the highly
spatially-resolved near to mid-infrared images of this object and the detailed
IRS spectrum, enable us to constrain the outflow cavity geometry quite well,
reducing uncertainties in the other derived parameters. The mid-infrared
scattered light image shows a bright central source within a dark lane; the
aspect ratio of this dark lane is such that it appears highly unlikely to be a
disk shadow. In modeling this dark lane, we conclude that L1527 IRS is probably
not described by a standard TSC envelope with simple bipolar cavities. We find
it necessary to model the dark lane and central source as a modified inner
envelope structure. This structure may be due either to a complex wind-envelope
interaction or induced by the central binary. To fit the overall SED, we
require the central source to have a large near to mid-infrared excess,
suggesting substantial disk accretion. Our model reproduces the overall
morphology and surface brightness distribution of L1527 IRS fairly well, given
the limitations of using axisymmetric models to fit the non-axisymmetric real
object, and the derived envelope infall rates are in reasonable agreement with
some other investigations. IRAC observations of L1527 IRS taken 12 months apart
show variability in total flux and variability in the opposing bipolar
cavities, suggesting asymmetric variations in accretion. We also provide model
images at high resolution for comparison to future observations with current
ground-based instrumentation and future space-based telescopes.

  Society",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.116402",,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A C$_3$-symmetric crystal-field potential in the Fe(II)Fe(III) bimetallic
oxalates splits the L=2 Fe(II) multiplet into two doublets and a singlet. In
compounds that exhibit magnetic compensation, one of the doublets was predicted
to lie lowest in energy and carry a non-quenched orbital angular momentum $\pm
\ld $, where $\ld $ exceeds a threshold value. In a range of $\ld $, a
Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion increases the energy splitting of the low-lying
doublet and breaks the C$_3$ symmetry of the bimetallic planes around the
ferrimagnetic transition temperature. At low temperatures, the JT distortion
disappears in compounds that display magnetic compensation due to the
competition with the spin-orbit coupling. A comparison with recent measurements
provides strong evidence for this re-entrant, low-temperature JT transition and
a prediction for the normal, high-temperature JT transition. The size of the JT
distortion is estimated using first-principles calculations, which suggest that
the long-range ordering of smaller, non-C$_3$-symmetric organic cations can
eliminate magnetic compensation.
