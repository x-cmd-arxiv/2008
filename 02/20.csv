cycle of period four of the quadratic recurrence equations. The solution is
demonstrated for the quadratic map and the logistic map. These recurrence
equations, presenting the real domain, as well as the Mandelbrot set,
presenting the complex domain, are at the very heart of dynamical systems and
chaos theory. Up to now, the closed explicit solutions of fixed points
functions have only been known for three bifurcation ranges: for the cycles of
period one, two and three. With the discovery of the solution for cycle four,
disclosed in this paper, further step has been made in our comprehension of
simultaneous complexity and simplicity which represents the beauty of nature.

hadron colliders as this is the only environment in which they can be
resonantly produced. In the simplest models we show that the coloron naturally
decays to multijets via secondary resonances, which can be consistent with all
existing bounds, even for colorons as light as a few hundred GeV. We perform
representative case studies and show that a search in the four-jet channel at
the Tevatron has strong signal significance, while the LHC faces formidable

dissociation by thermal X-rays is noted. We calculate the collision cross

We also discuss how the pair creation rate in the open-field circuit and the
outer magnetosphere can be strongly enhanced by instabilities near the light
cylinder. When the current has a strong fluctuating component, a cascade
develops. We examine the details of particle heating, and show that a high rate
of pair creation can be sustained close to the star, but only if the spin
period is shorter than several seconds. The dissipation rate in this turbulent
state can easily accommodate the observed radio output of the transient
radio-emitting magnetars, and even their infrared emission. Finally, we outline
how a very high rate of pair creation on the open magnetic field lines can help
to stabilize a static twist in the closed magnetosphere and to regulate the
loss of magnetic helicity by reconnection at the light cylinder.

magnetosphere of a magnetar. The standard polar-cap model for radio pulsars is
modified significantly when the polar magnetic field exceeds 1.8x10^{14} G.
Pairs are created by accelerated particles via resonant scattering of thermal
X-rays, followed by the nearly instantaneous conversion of the scattered photon
to a pair. A surface gap is then efficiently screened by e+- creation, which
regulates the voltage in the inner part of the circuit to ~10^9 V. We also
examine the electrostatic gap structure that can form when the magnetic field
is somewhat weaker, and deduce a voltage 10-30 times larger over a range of
surface temperatures. We examine carefully how the flow of charge back to the
star above the gap depends on the magnitude of the current that is extracted
from the surface of the star, on the curvature of the magnetic field lines, and
on resonant drag. The rates of different channels of pair creation are
determined self-consistently, including the non-resonant scattering of X-rays,
and collisions between gamma rays and X-rays. We find that the electrostatic
gap solution has too small a voltage to sustain the observed pulsed radio
output of magnetars unless i) the magnetic axis is nearly aligned with the
rotation axis and the light of sight; or ii) the gap is present on the closed
as well as the open magnetic field lines. Several properties of the radio
magnetars -- their rapid variability, broad pulses, and unusually hard radio
spectra -- are consistent with a third possibility, that the current in the
outer magnetosphere is strongly variable, and a very high rate of pair creation
is sustained by a turbulent cascade.

It is realized by
a class of Calabi--Yau compactification of Heterotic string theory. Trilinear
R-parity violation in superpotential is either absent or negligibly small
without an unbroken symmetry, due to a selection rule based on charge counting
of a spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry. Although such a selection rule cannot
be applied in general to non-renormalizable operators in the low-energy
effective superpotential, it is valid for terms trilinear in low-energy degrees
of freedom, and hence can be used as a solution to the dimension-4 proton decay
problem in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Bilinear R-parity
violation is generated, but there are good reasons why they are small enough to
satisfy its upper bounds from neutrino mass and washout of baryon/lepton
asymmetry. All R-parity violating dimension-5 operators can be generated. In
this theoretical framework, nucleons can decay through squark-exchange diagrams
combining dimension-5 and bilinear R-parity violating operators. B-L breaking

as well as dust. In order to protect the dust grains from destruction by the
hot gas as well as by the energetic radiation of the accretion disk, the dust
is often assumed to be distributed in clouds. In our new 3D model of AGN dust
tori, the torus is modelled as a wedge-shaped disk in which dusty clouds are
randomly distributed, by taking the dust density distribution of the
corresponding continuous model into account. We especially concentrate on the
differences between clumpy and continuous models in terms of the temperature
distributions, the surface brightness distributions and interferometric
visibilities, as well as spectral energy distributions. To this end, we employ
radiative transfer calculations with the help of the 3D Monte Carlo code MC3D.
In a second step, interferometric visibilities are calculated from the
simulated surface brightness distributions, which can be directly compared to
observations with the MIDI instrument. The radial temperature distributions of
clumpy models possess significantly enhanced scatter compared to the continuous
cases. Even at large distances, clouds can be heated directly by the central
accretion disk. The existence of the silicate 10 micron-feature in absorption
or in emission depends sensitively on the distribution, the size and optical
depth of clouds in the innermost part of the torus, due to shadowing effects of
clouds there. This explains failure and success of previous modelling efforts
of clumpy tori. After adapting the parameters of our clumpy standard model to
the circumstances of the Seyfert 2 Circinus galaxy, it can qualitatively
explain recent mid-infrared interferometric observations performed with MIDI,
as well as high resolution spectral data.

multi-wavelength observations collected at three different telescopes (HST, LBT
and CFHT) to probe Blue Straggler Star (BSS) populations in the globular
cluster M53. Almost 200 BSS have been identified over the entire cluster
extension. The radial distribution of these stars has been found to be bimodal
(similarly to that of several other clusters) with a prominent dip at ~60'' (~2
r_c) from the cluster center. This value turns out to be a factor of two
smaller than the radius of avoidance (r_avoid, the radius within which all the
stars of ~1.2 M_sun have sunk to the core because of dynamical friction effects
in an Hubble time). While in most of the clusters with a bimodal BSS radial
distribution, r_avoid has been found to be located in the region of the
observed minimum, this is the second case (after NGC6388) where this
discrepancy is noted. This evidence suggests that in a few clusters the
dynamical friction seems to be somehow less efficient than expected.
  We have also used this data base to construct the radial star density profile
of the cluster: this is the most extended and accurate radial profile ever
published for this cluster, including detailed star counts in the very inner
region. The star density profile is reproduced by a standard King Model with an
extended core (~25'') and a modest value of the concentration parameter
(c=1.58). A deviation from the model is noted in the most external region of
the cluster (at r>6.5' from the center). This feature needs to be further
investigated in order to address the possible presence of a tidal tail in this
cluster.

Using 24um data results in considerably more scatter in the correlation than
previous work using data at 60-70um. Nevertheless, we do observe a steady
correlation as a function of redshift, up to z~3.5, suggesting its validity
back to primeval times. We find q24 = 0.30 +/- 0.56 for the observed and q24 =
0.71 +/- 0.47 for the k-corrected radio sample, based on sources with 300uJy <
S(1.4GHz) < 3.2mJy and 24um detections. A suitable k-correction given by a
M82-like mid-IR template suggests no extreme silicate absorption in the bulk of
our radio sample. Using thresholds in q24 to identify radio-excess sources, we
have been able to characterise the transition from radio-loud AGN to
star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN at faint (<1mJy) radio flux
densities. Our results are in broad agreement with previous studies which show
a dominant radio-loud AGN population at >1mJy. The rest-frame U-B colours of
the expected radio-excess population have redder distribution than those that
follow the correlation. This is therefore a promising way to select obscured
Type-2 AGN, with a radio loud nature, missed by deep X-ray observations.

balance between exploring (learning) the availability probability of the
channels and exploiting the knowledge of the availability probability
identified thus far. For this scenario, an optimal medium access strategy is
derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples. To
avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of this optimal strategy, a low

We
find that for the burst to be produced via the synchrotron process unphysical
conditions are required -- the distance of the source from the center of the
explosion ($R_\gamma$) must be larger than $\sim 10^{17}$cm and the source
Lorentz factor $\gta 10^3$; for such a high Lorentz factor the deceleration
radius ($R_d$) is less than $R_\gamma$ even if the number density of particles
in the surrounding medium is as small as $\sim 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$. The result,
$R_\gamma > R_d$, is in contradiction with the early x-ray and optical
afterglow data. The synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process fares much better.
There is a large solution space for a typical GRB prompt emission to be
produced via the SSC process. The prompt optical emission accompanying the
burst is found to be very bright ($\lta$ 14 mag; for $z\sim2$) in the SSC
model, which exceeds the observed flux (or upper limit) for most GRBs.
Continuous acceleration of electrons can significantly reduce the optical flux
and bring it down to the observed limits. (Abridged)

(less than twice the time taken for the transmitted shock to cross the interior

insensitive to the magnetic field strength and orientation. However, at late
times strong fields substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud, suppressing
fragmentation and mixing by stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface.

at least from the point of view of descent sets and related geometry. The point
here is to use this resulting {\em descent system} $(W^J,S^J)$ to explicitly
encode some of the geometry and combinatorics that is intrinsic to the poset
$W^J$. In particular, we arrive at the notion of an {\em augmented poset}, and
we identify the {\em combinatorially smooth} subsets $J\subseteq S$ that have
special geometric significance in terms of a certain corresponding torus
embedding $X(J)$. The theory of $\mathscr{J}$-irreducible monoids provides an
essential tool in arriving at our main results.

local ellipticals, suggesting differences in the assembly history of these
types of systems. We also find that while most BCGs show monotonic colour
gradients consistent with a decrease in metallicity with radius, 25% of the
BCGs show colour profiles that turn bluer towards the centre (blue-cores). We
interpret this bluing trend as evidence for recent star formation. The excess
blue light leads to a typical offset from the red sequence of 0.5 to 1.0 mag in
(g'-r'), thus affecting optical cluster studies that may reject the BCG based
on colour. All of the blue-core BCGs are located within ~10 kpc of the peak in
the cluster X-ray emission. Furthermore, virtually all of the BCGs with recent
star formation are in clusters that lie above the Lx-Tx relation. Based on
photometry alone, these findings suggest that central star formation is a
ubiquitous feature of BCGs in dynamically relaxed cool-core clusters. This
implies that while AGNs and other heating mechanisms are effective at tempering
cooling, they do not full compensate for the energy lost via radiation.

Universe, and are thought to be the dominant mechanism by which massive
galaxies grow their mass at late times. These ``dry'' mergers can be readily
identified in very deep ground based images, thanks to their extended low
surface brightness tidal features. However, ground-based images lack the
required resolution to determine the morphologies of the merging galaxies, and
to measure the amount of dust and associated gas. We present HST/ACS and WFPC2
observations of a sample of 31 bulge-dominated red-sequence galaxies at z~0.1,
comprised of ongoing mergers, merger remnants, and undisturbed galaxies. Nearly
all galaxies have early-type morphologies and most are well-fit by r^1/4 law
surface brightness profiles. We find that only 10% of the galaxies show
evidence for the presence of dust. The amount of cold gas (or its upper limit)
is calculated from the mean color-excess, assuming a simple relation between
gas mass and dust mass. The gas mass is low for all galaxies, and we find that
Mgas/Mstellar < 3x10^-4. We infer that red mergers in the nearby Universe
mostly involve early-type galaxies containing little cold gas and dust. This
may imply that the progenitors were mostly devoid of gas and/or that feedback
mechanisms are very effective in preventing the gas to cool. The lack of gas in
these objects may also imply a relatively large fraction of binary black holes
in the centers of massive ellipticals.

Their interstellar medium has mean density n_H~10--100 cm^-3, metallicity Z~
0.01--0.1 Zsolar and can sustain a multi-phase structure. With large scatter,
the mean efficiency of star formation scales with halo mass, <f_*> \propto
M_dm^2, independent of redshift. Because of feedback, halos smaller than a
critical mass, M_crit(z), are devoid of most of their baryons. More
interestingly, we find that dark halos have always a smaller M_crit(z) than
luminous ones. Metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium is inhomogeneous,

from only a few optical spectra, the most important of which was seriously
affected by a CCD defect. Here we present new spectra of the WR star, spanning
one month, obtained with the Keck-I 10 m telescope. The spectra show a periodic
shift in the He II 4686 Ang. emission line as compared with IC 10 nebular lines

optical depth may approach unity for high angular-resolution (VLBI) imaging of

density inferred from X-ray absorption data, ~10^{23}/cm^2. Spreading the 21cm
absorption over the full rotation velocity width of the material in front of
the narrow radio jets gives a mean optical depth of ~0.1. Spectroscopic
searches for the 21cm absorption feature in other galaxies can be used to
identify the large population of inclined gaseous disks which are not masing in
our direction. Follow-up imaging of 21cm silhouettes of accelerating clumps
within these disks can in turn be used to measure cosmological distances.

orthogonality properties of the basis polynomials solve the matrix-coefficient
growth problem, and eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs can be computed stably at
spectral orders at least as large as p = 3,000 with p-independent roundoff
error. Accuracy is limited instead by roundoff sensitivity due to non-normality
of the stability operators at large hydrodynamic and/or magnetic Reynolds
numbers (Re, Rm > 4E4). In problems with Hartmann velocity and magnetic-field
profiles we employ suitable Gauss quadrature rules to evaluate the associated
exponentially weighted sesquilinear forms without error. An alternative
approach, which involves approximating the forms by means of
Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) quadrature at the 2p - 1 precision level, is found
to yield equal eigenvalues within roundoff error. As a consistency check, we
compare modal growth rates to energy growth rates in nonlinear simulations and
record relative discrepancy smaller than $ 1E-5 $ for the least stable mode in
free-surface flow at Re = 3E4. Moreover, we confirm that the computed normal
modes satisfy an energy conservation law for free-surface MHD with error
smaller than 1E-6. The critical Reynolds number in free-surface MHD is found to
be sensitive to the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, even at the Pm = O(1E-5) regime

a palindrome if $pq$ is even and the unique product of two unique palindromes
if $pq$ is odd. We prove that the pairs $(E_{p/q},E_{r/s})$ generate the group
when $|ps-rq|=1$. This improves the previously known result that held only for
$pq$ and $rs$ both even. The derivation of the enumeration scheme also gives a

parent stars and giant planetary companions in 51 Peg-type systems. We
demonstrate from MOST satellite photometry and Ca II K line emission that there
has been a persistent, variable region on the surface of tau Boo A which
tracked its giant planetary companion for some 440 planetary revolutions and
lies ~68deg (phi=0.8) in advance of the sub-planetary point. The light curves
are folded on a range of periods centered on the planetary orbital period and
phase dependent variability is quantified by Fourier methods and by the mean
absolute deviation (MAD) of the folded data for both the photometry and the Ca
II K line reversals. The region varies in brightness on the time scale of a
rotation by ~1 mmag. In 2004 it resembled a dark spot of variable depth, while
in 2005 it varied between bright and dark. Over the 123 planetary orbits
spanned by the photometry the variable region detected in 2004 and in 2005 are
synchronised to the planetary orbital period within 0.0015 d. The Ca II K line
in 2001, 2002 and 2003 also shows enhanced K-line variability centered on
phi=0.8, extending coverage to some 440 planetary revolutions. The apparently
constant rotation period of the variable region and its rapid variation make an
explanation in terms of conventional star spots unlikely. The lack of
complementary variability at phi=0.3 and the detection of the variable region
so far in advance of the sub-planetary point excludes tidal excitation, but the
combined photometric and Ca II K line reversal results make a good case for an
active region induced magnetically on the surface of tau Boo A by its planetary
companion.

constructed in Lorentzian AdS by Drukker et al. The solution is shown to be
composed of a dual giant Wilson loop and a dual giant graviton by minutely
examining its shape. This observation suggests that the corresponding
gauge-theory operator should be a k-th symmetric Wilson loop with the
insertions of dual giant graviton operators. To support the correspondence, the
classical action of the solution should be computed and compared with the
gauge-theory result. For this purpose we first perform a Wick rotation to the
Lorentzian solution by following the tunneling prescription and obtain
Euclidean solutions corresponding to a circular or a straight-line Wilson loop.
In Euclidean signature boundary terms can be properly considered in the
standard manner and the classical action for the Euclidean solutions can be
evaluated. The result indeed reproduces the expectation value of the k-th
symmetric Wilson loop as well as the power-law behavior of the correlation
function of dual giant graviton operators.

on scales above a few parsecs are measured. In the interarm regions
fluctuations on larger scales than in spiral arms are present, and show power
law behavior with a shallow spectrum. These results suggest that in the spiral

the energy injection for the turbulent energy cascade on parsec scales, while
in the interarm regions supernova and super bubble explosions are the main

around day 10 in the X-ray light curve. We show that for the physical
parameters derived for GRB 070125, inverse Compton scattering effects are
important throughout the afterglow evolution. While inverse Compton scattering
does not affect radio and optical bands, it may be a promising candidate to
delay the jet break in the X-ray band. Radio light curves show rapid flux
variations, which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation, and are
used to derive an upper limit of $2.4 \times 10^{17}$ cm on the radius of the
fireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet. Radio light curves and
spectra suggest a high synchrotron self absorption frequency indicative of the
afterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium. Our broadband modeling favors a
constant density profile for the circumburst medium over a wind-like profile
($R^{-2}$). However, keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters, it is
difficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles. Our
broadband fits suggest that \event is a burst with high radiative efficiency

the authors addressed the question of realizing a Floer complex as the celluar

determined by the compactified moduli spaces of connecting orbits. The basic
obstructions to the existence of this realization are the smoothness of these
moduli spaces, and the existence of compatible collections of framings of their
stable tangent bundles. In this note we describe a generalization of this, to
show that when these moduli spaces are smooth, and are oriented with respect to
a generalized cohomology theory E^*, then a Floer E_* -homology theory can be
defined. In doing this we describe a functorial viewpoint on how chain

However, around solar system planets the production of energetic neutral atoms
from charge exchange between solar wind protons and neutral hydrogen from the

we show that the measured transit-associated Ly-$\alpha$ absorption can be
explained by the interaction between the exosphere of HD 209458b and the
stellar wind, and that radiation pressure alone cannot explain the observation.
This is the first observation of energetic neutral atoms outside the solar

neutral atoms, this provides a completely new method of probing stellar wind
conditions, and our model suggests a slow and hot stellar wind near HD 209458b

the CO changes direction to trace two more extended spiral features at a lower
pitch angle. These are the beginning of two straight dust lanes, which are
aligned parallel to an oval distortion, reminiscent of a primary bar, almost
perpendicular to the nuclear one. The two embedded bars appear in Spitzer IRAC
near-infrared images, and HST color images, although highly obscured by dust in
the latter. We compute the torques exerted by the stellar bars on the gas, and
find systematically negative average torques down to the resolution limit of
the images, providing evidence of gas inflow tantalizingly close to the nucleus
of NGC 2782. The observations are well reproduced by numerical simulations,
including gas dissipation, which predict the secondary bar decoupling, the
formation of an elongated ring at the 1 kpc-radius Inner Lindblad Resonance
(ILR) of the primary bar, and the gas inflow to the ILR of the nuclear bar. The
presence of molecular gas inside the ILR of the primary bar, transported by a
second nuclear bar, is a potential ``smoking gun''; the gas there is certainly
fueling the central starburst, and in a second step could fuel directly the
AGN.

slightly vary from source to source. The momenta and start times measured from
the TD diagrams in the sources S1-S3 are compared with those delivered to the
photosphere by different kinds of high energy particles with the parameters
deduced from hard X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission as well as by the
hydrodynamic shocks caused by these particles. The energetic protons (power
laws combined with quasi-thermal ones, or jets) are shown to deliver momentum
high enough and to form the hydrodynamic shocks deeply in a flaring atmosphere
that allows them to be delivered to the photosphere through much shorter
distances and times. Then the seismic waves observed in the sources S2 and S3
can be explained by the momenta produced by hydrodynamic shocks which are
caused by mixed proton beams and jets occurring nearly simultaneously with the
third burst of hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray emission in the loops with
footpoints in the locations of these sources. The seismic wave in the source
S1, delayed by 4 and 2 minutes from the first and second HXR bursts,
respectively, is likely to be associated with a hydrodynamic shock occurring in
this loop from precipitation of a very powerful and hard electron beam with
higher energy cutoff mixed with quasi-thermal protons generated by either of

covered with suitable affine open subschemes whose construction is achieved
using border bases. Moreover, border bases have proved to be an excellent tool
for describing zero-dimensional ideals when the coefficients are inexact. And
in this situation they show a clear advantage with respect to Groebner bases
which, nevertheless, can also be used in the study of Hilbert schemes, since
they provide tools for constructing suitable stratifications.
  In this paper we compare Groebner basis schemes with border basis schemes. It
is shown that Groebner basis schemes and their associated universal families
can be viewed as weighted projective schemes. A first consequence of our
approach is the proof that all the ideals which define a Groebner basis scheme
and are obtained using Buchberger's Algorithm, are equal. Another result is
that if the origin (i.e. the point corresponding to the unique monomial ideal)
in the Groebner basis scheme is smooth, then the scheme itself is isomorphic to
an affine space. This fact represents a remarkable difference between border
basis and Groebner basis schemes. Since it is natural to look for situations
where a Groebner basis scheme and the corresponding border basis scheme are
equal, we address the issue, provide an answer, and exhibit some consequences.
Open problems are discussed at the end of the paper.

relaxation of perturbations at larger scales using N-Body simulations. We
quantify the effect of collapsed haloes on perturbations at larger scales using
two point correlation function, moments of counts in cells and mass function.
The purpose of the study is twofold and the primary aim is to quantify the role
played by collapsed low mass haloes in the evolution of perturbations at large
scales, this is in view of the strong effect seen when the large scale
perturbation is highly symmetric. Another reason for this study is to ask
whether features or a cutoff in the initial power spectrum can be detected
using measures of clustering at scales that are already non-linear. The final
aim is to understand the effect of ignoring perturbations at scales smaller
than the resolution of N-Body simulations. We find that these effects are
ignorable if the scale of non-linearity is larger than the average
inter-particle separation in simulations. Features in in the initial power
spectrum can be detected easily if the scale of these features is in the linear
regime, detecting such features becomes difficult as the relevant scales become
non-linear. We find no effect of features in initial power spectra at small
scales on the evolved power spectra at large scales. We may conclude that in
general, the effect on evolution of perturbations at large scales of clumping
on small scales is very small and may be ignored in most situations.

various seed field generation mechanisms including Biermann batteries. These in

further amplification by dynamo action. The basic idea behind fluctuation
dynamos, as applied to cluster magnetism and the mean-field helical dynamo as
applied to disk galaxies, are outlined. Major difficulties with the dynamo
paradigm are considered. It is particularly important to understand the
nonlinear saturation of dynamos, and whether the fields produced are coherent
enough on large-scales to explain the observed fields in galaxies and clusters.

may be affected by the personal features. Now we investigate how an

affects an evolutionary process. For this purpose we employ the evolutionary
prisoner's dilemma game on different complex graphs. Reproduction restrictions
can have a facilitative effect on the evolution of cooperation that sets in
irrespective of particularities of the interaction network. Indeed, an
appropriate fraction of less fertile individuals may lead to full supremacy of
cooperators where otherwise defection would be widespread. By studying
cooperation levels within the group of individuals having full reproduction
capabilities, we reveal that the recent mechanism for the promotion of
cooperation is conceptually similar to the one reported previously for
scale-free networks. Our results suggest that the diversity in the reproduction
capability, related to inherently different attitudes of individuals, can
enforce the emergence of cooperative behavior among selfish competitors.

Even when such Wilson lines are trivial from the orbifold perspective, they can
still lead to additional symmetry breaking in blow-up. Full agreement is
achieved between orbifold and resolved models, at the level of gauge
interactions, massless spectrum and anomaly cancellation. In this matching the
blow-up modes are of crucial importance: they play the role of model-dependent
axions involved in the cancellation of multiple anomalous U(1)'s on the
resolution. We illustrate various aspects by investigating blow-ups of a Z_3
MSSM model with two Wilson lines: if all its fixed points are resolved
simultaneously, the SM gauge group is necessarily broken. Finally, we explore
in detail the anomaly cancellation on the complex two dimensional resolution of

have been considered. The second, somewhat complementary approach involves a
Monte Carlo code in which all nuclear rates are randomly varied within
uncertainty limits simultaneously. All in all, about 50,000 post-processing
calculations, with a network containing 606 nuclides (H to 113Xe) and more than
3500 nuclear processes, have been performed in this work. A brief comparison
between both procedures is outlined together with an overall account of the key
nuclear reactions whose uncertainties have the largest impact in our X-ray
burst nucleosynthesis studies.

important and challenging problem to identify reduced macroscopic models that
describe some effective dynamics on large spatial and temporal scales. This
paper concerns the question how reasonable macroscopic Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian structures can by derived from the microscopic system.
  In the first part we develop a general approach to this problem by
considering non-canonical Hamiltonian structures on the tangent bundle. This
approach can be applied to all Hamiltonian lattices (or Hamiltonian PDEs) and
involves three building blocks: (i) the embedding of the microscopic system,
(ii) an invertible two-scale transformation that encodes the underlying scaling
of space and time, (iii) an elementary model reduction that is based on a
Principle of Consistent Expansions.
  In the second part we exemplify the reduction approach and derive various
reduced PDE models for the atomic chain. The reduced equations are either
related to long wave-length motion or describe the macroscopic modulation of an
oscillatory microstructure.

one of several options, each of which consists of a one-time setup cost
(``buying price''), and cost proportional to the duration of the usage
(``rental rate''). The larger the price, the smaller the rent. The actual usage
time is determined by an adversary, and the goal of an algorithm is to minimize
the cost by choosing the best option at any point in time. Multislope Ski
Rental is a natural generalization of the classical Ski Rental problem (where
the only options are pure rent and pure buy), which is one of the fundamental
problems of online computation. The Multislope Ski Rental problem is an
abstraction of many problems where online decisions cannot be modeled by just
two options, e.g., power management in systems which can be shut down in parts.

open sets. As a by-product, we get a criterion of $\mathbf{0'}$ Martin-L\""of
randomness (called also 2-randomness) proved in (Miller, 2004): a sequence
$\omega$ is 2-random if and only if there exists $c$ such that any prefix $x$
of $\omega$ is a prefix of some string $y$ such that $\KS(y)\ge |y|-c$. (In the
1960ies this property was suggested in (Kolmogorov, 1968) as one of possible

infinitely many prefixes $x$ of $\omega$. Finally, we show that the low-basis

functions and functions which are far from linear. Linearity tests were first
introduced by (Blum, Luby and Rubenfeld, 1993), and were later used in the PCP
theorem, among other applications. The quality of a linearity test is described
by its correctness c - the probability it accepts linear functions, its
soundness s - the probability it accepts functions far from linear, and its
query complexity q - the number of queries it makes. Linearity tests were
studied in order to decrease the soundness of linearity tests, while keeping
the query complexity small (for one reason, to improve PCP constructions).
Samorodnitsky and Trevisan (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan 2000) constructed the
Complete Graph Test, and prove that no Hyper Graph Test can perform better than
the Complete Graph Test. Later in (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan 2006) they prove,
among other results, that no non-adaptive linearity test can perform better
than the Complete Graph Test. Their proof uses the algebraic machinery of the
Gowers Norm. A result by (Ben-Sasson, Harsha and Raskhodnikova 2005) allows to
generalize this lower bound also to adaptive linearity tests. We also prove the
same optimal lower bound for adaptive linearity test, but our proof technique
is arguably simpler and more direct than the one used in (Samorodnitsky and

analyzing the Gowers Norm of certain functions, we provide a more direct

relation of countable index has an omega-regular set of representatives. This

decidability was known). The same remains true if predicates mod $d$ for fixed

the classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\Sigma_1$ are decidable. - For
the restricted case of a two-letter alphabet, the classes of the Boolean
hierarchy over level $\Sigma_2$ of the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy are
decidable in $NL$. This is the first decidability result for this hierarchy. -
The membership problems for all mentioned Boolean-hierarchy classes are

defining the complement of a given regular expression, a double exponential
size increase cannot be avoided. Similarly, when constructing a regular
expression defining the intersection of a fixed and an arbitrary number of
regular expressions, an exponential and double exponential size increase,
respectively, can in worst-case not be avoided. All mentioned lower bounds
improve the existing ones by one exponential and are tight in the sense that
the target expression can be constructed in the corresponding time class, i.e.,
exponential or double exponential time. As a by-product, we generalize a
theorem by Ehrenfeucht and Zeiger stating that there is a class of DFAs which
are exponentially more succinct than regular expressions, to a fixed
four-letter alphabet. When the given regular expressions are one-unambiguous,
as for instance required by the XML Schema specification, the complement can be
computed in polynomial time whereas the bounds concerning intersection continue
to hold. For the subclass of single-occurrence regular expressions, we prove a
tight exponential lower bound for intersection.

the masses of both the initial particles from the hard scattering and the

technique may be of most use for measurements of SUSY particle masses at the

like transformation is observed (around 5T at 2K). Macroscopic magnetization
measurements and SANS indicate that this transformation occurs by the formation
of mesoscopic ferromagnetic metallic (FM) domains in the AFI phase, and,
eventually, in the FI phase. Although above 5K this transformation is
continuous, below 5K a magnetization step marks the abrupt transition from a

breaking phase transition leading to full homochirality from racemic initial

($\epsilon_L = \epsilon_R$) autogenic formation, showing that it only achieves
homochirality for $\epsilon < \epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon_c$ is an N-dependent
critical value. For $\epsilon \leq \epsilon_c$ we investigate the behavior of
