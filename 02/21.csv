(cpa=2-carboxypentonic acid; X=F,Cl,Br) have copper sites which form a
triangular kagome lattice (TKL), formed by introducing small triangles
(``a-trimers'') inside of each kagome triangle (``b-trimer''). We show that in
the limit where spins residing on b-trimers have Ising character, quantum
fluctuations of XXZ spins residing on the a-trimers can be exactly accounted
for in the absence of applied field. This is accomplished through a mapping to
the kagome Ising model, for which exact analytic solutions exist. We derive the
complete finite temperature phase diagram for this XXZ-Ising model, including
the residual zero temperature entropies of the seven ground state phases.
Whereas the disordered (spin liquid) ground state of the pure Ising TKL model
has macroscopic residual entropy ln72=4.2767... per unit cell, the introduction
of transverse(quantum) couplings between neighboring $a$-spins reduces this
entropy to 2.5258... per unit cell. In the presence of applied magnetic field,
we map the TKL XXZ-Ising model to the kagome Ising model with three-spin
interactions, and derive the ground state phase diagram. A small (or even
infinitesimal) field leads to a new phase that corresponds to a
non-intersecting loop gas on the kagome lattice, with entropy 1.4053... per
unit cell and a mean magnetization for the b-spins of 0.12(1) per site. In
addition, we find that for moderate applied field, there is a critical spin
liquid phase which maps to close-packed dimers on the honeycomb lattice, which
survives even when the a-spins are in the Heisenberg limit.

semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the Millennium
Simulation of dark matter structure growth. The fraction of merging galaxy
pairs at each time-step of the simulation is derived from the galaxy catalogues
obtained by the models and the results are compared with various observational
estimates of merger fractions taken from the literature. We find a good match
between the pair fractions derived from the simulation and the observed
counting of galaxy pairs obtained by different sources in the redshift range 0
< z < 1.2. The predicted evolution of the number of galaxy mergers per Gyr
grows with redshift as an exponential rate proportional to (1+z)^m, with m
ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for 0 < z < 2, depending on the luminosity and mass
ratios of the merging galaxies. Our results are in agreement with recent
observational results that argue for a flat evolution in the fraction of galaxy
mergers since z ~ 1.2. The weak evolution predicted for the galaxy merger rate
in an hierarchical model universe shows that the mass assembly evolution of
galaxies through mergers does not follow the rapid evolution of the halo merger
rate obtained in previous studies.

high-resolution resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) to compounds
containing CoO6 clusters. When contrasted to quadrupole local 1s3d excitations,
these non-local 1s3d transitions are identified by their energy dispersion and
angular dependence, their sensitivity to second-shell effects (i.e. the
connection mode of the CoO6 octahedra and the bond lengths), and an upwards
energy shift of 2.5 eV due to the poorer screening of the core hole. The
experiment reveals that the intensity of the non-local transitions gauges the
oxygen-mediated 4p-O-3d intersite hybridization. We propose a revised
interpretation of the pre-edges of transition metal compounds. Detailed
analysis of these new features in the pre-edge offers a unique insight in the
oxygen mediated metal-metal interactions in transition metal-based systems,
which is a crucial aspect in orbital ordering and related electronic and

meaningless abstraction, and he held firmly to the view that the only
significant thing was the set of relationships between 'objects', whatever
these 'objects' might be. Similarly, he was equally clear in expressing his
views about Newton's universal time, which he also considered to be a
meaningless abstraction. In effect, for him, time was no more than a synonym
for ordered change within a material system.
  The process of giving quantitative realization to this duality of
non-Newtonian ideas forms the core of this work. A primary result arising is
that every gravitating particle is no more than a clock - the geometric Leibniz
Clock - which provides all the basic things: it conserves energy and angular
momentum and satisfies the Weak Equivalence Principle.
  When the Clock is applied to model the concept of a galactic object within
which all motions are circular, the characteristic properties of the MOND
galaxy (asymptotic flatness, a critical acceleration scale, the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relationship) are quantitatively reproduced in the resulting
Leibniz galaxy. In short, the characteristic essence of MOND has its source in

quantitatively mapped by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) with calibrated

radius varying from 10 to 300 nm. The magnitude and variation of the
experimental piezoelectric coefficient across a domain wall matches the
profiles calculated from a comprehensive analytical theory, as well as
3-dimensional finite element method simulations. Quantitative agreement between
experimental and theoretical profile widths is obtained only when a finite
disk-type tip radius that is in true contact with the sample surface is
considered, which is in agreement with scanning electron microscopy images of
the actual tips after imaging. The magnitude of the piezoelectric coefficient
is shown to be independent of the tip radius, and the PFM profile width is
linearly proportional to the tip radius. Finally we demonstrate a method to
extract any intrinsic material broadening of the ferroelectric wall width.
Surprisingly wide wall widths of 20- 200nm are observed.

the observation that many emission lines originate from clumpy knots within
galaxies. This 2D line-finding method proves to be useful in detecting emission
lines from compact knots within galaxies that might not otherwise be detected
using more traditional 1D line-finding techniques. We find in total 96 emission
lines in the HUDF, originating from 81 distinct ""knots'' within 63 individual
galaxies. We find in general that [OIII] emitters are the most common,
comprising 44% of the sample, and on average have high equivalent widths (70%
of [OIII] emitters having rest-frame EW>100A). There are 12 galaxies with
multiple emitting knots--with different knots exhibiting varying flux values,
suggesting that the differing star formation properties across a single galaxy
can in general be probed at redshifts z~0.2-0.4. The most prevalent
morphologies are large face-on spirals and clumpy interacting systems, many
being unique detections owing to the 2D method described here, thus

as the size of the system goes down. In particular, the gravitational field,
according to general relativity, tends to become dominated by the spin at
distances of the order of the Compton wavelength. The relevant quantity which
governs this behavior is the ratio S/M^2 where S is the (spin) angular
momentum. For an electron, S/M^2 ~ 10^44. Therefore, gravitomagnetic effects
will play a significant role in the subatomic domain. To analyze this situation
we use the asymptotic structure in the form of the multipole fields. Some
important consequences for the electromagnetic fields of charged particles with
spin are pointed out. In particular, the gravitational field may induce
corrections to the Coulomb field which can be tested experimentally.

positrons are generally very boosted, yielding a hard spectrum, in addition to
the low energy positrons needed for INTEGRAL observations of the galactic
center. We consider the relevance of this scenario for HEAT, PAMELA and the
WMAP ""haze,"" focusing on light (m_phi ~< 2 m_pi) phi bosons, and find that
significant signals can be found for all three, although significant signals
generally require high dark matter densities. We find that measurements of the
positron fraction are generally insensitive to the halo model, but do suffer
significant astrophysical uncertainties. We discuss the implications for
upcoming PAMELA results.

observed in the VIMOS MR survey. Here we report results for the first 6 masks

and 968 from 6 MR masks. 33% of the LR-Blue and 18% of the MR spectra are
serendipitous observations. We obtained 1481 redshifts in the LR-Blue campaign

master catalog. By comparing this redshift compilation with different
photometric redshift catalogs we estimate the completeness level of the CDF-S
spectroscopic coverage in several redshift bins. The completeness level is very
high, > 60%, at z < 3.5, and it is very uncertain at higher redshift. The

variability in shape and flux. ROSAT data classified it as soft X-ray weak QSO
(objects whose X-ray-to-optical flux ratio is smaller than in typical QSO):
their X-ray spectra are often characterized by highly ionized, complex
absorbers and/or reflection from the disk, whose relative importance is
currently debated. In both cases, the presence of such features implies that we
are looking at matter located in the innermost regions of the AGN. In this
paper we want to clarify the nature of the X-ray emission of PG1535+547, and
constrain the physical properties of regions where the emission originates. We
present new XMM observations, from which we obtained 2 spectra separated by
about 1 week, that we compare with a previous XMM observation. The data support
the complex and variable nature of the X-ray emission. The broad band flux
increases by a factor ~2.3 in 3 years, and then decreases by a factor ~1.3 in
about 1 week. In the new EPIC spectra strong absorption features at E<3keV and
a complex spectral shape in the Fe line energy range are evident, coupled with
a drop in the emission at higher energies. We describe all the states assuming
either a warm absorber plus a relativistically blurred ionized reflection, or a
two-phase warm absorber partially covering the source plus a scattered
component. The variability is ascribed to the warm absorbers, that vary their
physical properties on timescales of years and days. In the reflection scenario
all the states require a high fraction of reflection. The strong variability in
the X-ray band opposed to a more constant optical emission implies that
PG1535+547 can not actually be classified as a soft X-ray weak AGN.

orbits, and are nearly coplanar with Charon, Pluto's major moon. This is
surprising because tidal interactions with Pluto are too weak to damp their
eccentricities. We consider an alternative possibility: that Nix and Hydra
circularize their orbits by exciting Charon's eccentricity via secular
interactions, and Charon in turn damps its own eccentricity by tidal
interaction with Pluto. The timescale for this process can be less than the age
of the Solar System, for plausible tidal parameters and moon masses. However,
as we show numerically and analytically, the effects of the 2:1 and 3:1
resonant forcing terms between Nix and Charon complicate this picture. In the
presence of Charon's tidal damping, the 2:1 term forces Nix to migrate outward
and the 3:1 term changes the eccentricity damping rate, sometimes leading to
eccentricity growth. We conclude that this mechanism probably does not explain
Nix and Hydra's current orbits. Instead, we suggest that they were formed
in-situ with low eccentricities.
  We also show that an upper limit on Nix's migration speed sets a lower limit
on Pluto-Charon's tidal circularization timescale of >10^5 yrs. Moreover,
Hydra's observed proper eccentricity may be explained by the 3:2 forcing by
Nix.

color selection has not been applied to such faint magnitudes in such a large
continuous part of the sky. Hot stars are known to be the dominant contaminant
for bright AGN candidate selection at z<2, but we anticipate the highest color
contamination at all redshifts to be from faint starburst and compact galaxies.
Morphological selection via the Gini Coefficient separates most potential AGN
from these faint blue galaxies. Recent models of the quasar luminosity function
are used to estimate quasar surface densities, and studies of stellar
populations in the COSMOS field infer stellar contamination. We use 292
spectroscopically confirmed type 1 AGN and quasar templates to predict AGN
colors with redshift, and contrast those predictions with the colors of known
contaminating populations. The motivation of this study and subsequent
spectroscopic follow-up is to populate and refine the faint end of the QLF
where the population of type 1 AGN is presently not well known. The anticipated
AGN observations will add to the ~300 already known AGN in the COSMOS field,
making COSMOS a densely packed field of quasars to be used to understand
supermassive black holes and probe the structure of the intergalactic medium in

centre. The abundance ratios also show spatial variations. The X-ray derived
Oxygen abundance is lower than that measured in the atmospheres of red
supergiant stars, leading to the hypothesis that a significant fraction of
Oxygen ions have already cooled off and no longer emit at energies > ~0.5 keV.

features of the hierarchical structure of the isosurfaces for molecular line
data cubes. The dendrogram of a data cube is an abstraction of the changing
topology of the isosurfaces as a function of contour level. The ability to
track hierarchical structure over a range of scales makes this analysis
philosophically different from local segmentation algorithms like CLUMPFIND.
Points in the dendrogram structure correspond to specific volumes in data cubes
defined by their bounding isosurfaces. We further refine the technique by
measuring the properties associated with each isosurface in the analysis
allowing for a multiscale calculation of molecular gas properties. Using
COMPLETE 13CO(1-0) data from the L1448 region in Perseus and mock observations
of a simulated data cube, we identify regions that have a significant
contribution by self-gravity to their energetics on a range of scales. We find
evidence for self-gravitation on all spatial scales in L1448 though not in all
regions. In the simulated observations, nearly all of the emission is found in
objects that would be self-gravitating if gravity were included in the
simulation. We reconstruct the size-line width relationship within the data
cube using the dendrogram-derived properties and find it follows the standard
relation: s_v ~ R^0.58. Finally, we show that constructing the dendrogram of CO
J=1-0 emission from the Orion-Monoceros region allows for the identification of
giant molecular clouds in a blended molecular line data set using only a
physically motivated definition (self-gravitating clouds with masses 5x10^4

an elegant solution in which Nix and Hydra formed in the collision that
produced Charon, then were caught into corotation resonances with Charon, and
finally were transported to their current location as Charon migrated outwards.
We show with numerical integrations that, if Charon's eccentricity is
judiciously chosen, this scenario works beautifully for either Nix or Hydra.
However, it cannot work for both Nix and Hydra simultaneously. To transport
Nix, Charon's eccentricity must satisfy e_C< 0.024; otherwise, the second order
Lindblad resonance at 4:1 overlaps with the corotation resonance, leading to
chaos. To transport Hydra, e_C > 0.7 R_p/a_C > 0.04; otherwise migration would
be faster than libration, and Hydra would slip out of resonance. These two
restrictions conflict. Having ruled out this scenario, we suggest an
alternative: that many small bodies were captured from the nebular disk, and
they were responsible for forming, migrating and damping Nix and Hydra. If this
is true, small moons could be common around large Kuiper belt objects.

energy cascading through massive closed string loops to KK modes which then
decay into lighter standard model particles. However, massive KK modes in the

which, in turn, can increase statistical power.
  Results: Vastly and demonstrably improved differential analysis approaches
are the result of combining identifiability (the fact that in most microarray
data sets, a large proportion of genes can be identified a priori as
non-differential) with optimization criteria that incorporate correlation. As a
special case, we develop a method which builds upon the widely used two-sample
t-statistic based approach and uses the Mahalanobis distance as an optimality
criterion. Results on the prostate cancer data of Singh et al. (2002) suggest
that the proposed method outperforms all published approaches in terms of

pulsars, J1509-5850 and J1740+1000. The tail of PSR J1509-5850 is discernible
up to 5.6' from the pulsar (6.5 pc at a distance of 4 kpc), with a flux of
2*10^{-13} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in 0.5-8 keV. The tail spectrum fits an absorbed
power-law (PL) model with the photon index of 2.3\pm0.2, corresponding to the
0.5-8 keV luminosity of 1*10^{33} ergs s^{-1}, for n_H= 2.1*10^{22} cm^{-2}.
The tail of PSR J1740+1000 is firmly detected up to 5' (2 pc at a 1.4 kpc
distance), with a flux of 6*10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in 0.4-10 keV. The PL
fit yields photon index of 1.4-1.5 and n_H=1*10^{21} cm^{-2}. The large extent
of the tails suggests that the bulk flow in the tails starts as mildly
relativistic downstream of the termination shock, and then gradually
decelerates. Within the observed extent of the J1509-5850 tail, the average
flow speed exceeds 5,000 km s^{-1}, and the equipartition magnetic field is a
few times 10^{-5} G. For the J1740+1000 tail, the equipartition field is a
factor of a few lower. The harder spectrum of the J1740+1000 tail implies
either less efficient cooling or a harder spectrum of injected electrons. For
the high-latitude PSR J1740+1000, the orientation of the tail on the sky shows
that the pulsar is moving toward the Galactic plane, which means that it was
born from a halo-star progenitor. The comparison between the J1509 and J1740

are likely white dwarfs that steadily or cyclically burn accreted matter on
their surface, which are promising type Ia supernova progenitors. Observations
of distant galaxies with Chandra and XMM-Newton have revealed supersoft sources
that are generally hotter and more luminous, including some ultraluminous
supersoft sources (ULSs) that are possibly intermediate mass black holes of a
few thousand solar masses. In this paper we report our X-ray spectral and
timing analysis for M81-ULS1, an ultraluminous supersoft source in the nearby
spiral galaxy M81. M81-ULS1 has been persistently supersoft in 17 Chandra ACIS
observations spanning six years, and its spectrum can be described by either a
$kT_{bb}\approx70$ eV blackbody for a $\sim1.2M_\odot$ white dwarf, or a
$kT_{in} \approx 80$ eV multicolor accretion disk for a $\gtrsim10^3M_\odot$
intermediate mass black hole. In two observations, the light curves exhibited
dramatic flux drop/rise on time scales of $10^3$ seconds, reminiscent of
eclipse ingress/egress in eclipsing X-ray binaries. However, the exhaustive
search for periodicity in the reasonable range of 50 ksec to 50 days failed to
reveal an orbital period. The failure to reveal any periodicity is consistent
with the long period ($\ge30$ yrs) predicted for this system given the optical
identification of the secondary with an asymptotic giant star. Also, the
eclipse-like dramatic flux changes in hours are hard to explain under the white
dwarf model, but can in principle be explained by disk temperature changes
induced by accretion rate variations under the intermediate mass black hole
model.

glauber gluons we are able to show that the effects of glauber gluons in

of glauber gluons. Our work completes the proof or argument of factorization of

conventional, i.e., it does not make use of joint cell-site processing. A hard
fairness (HF) system serves all users with the same rate in any channel state.
In contrast, a system based on proportional fairness serves the users with
variable instantaneous rates depending on their channel state. We compare these
two options in terms of the system spectral efficiency \textsf{C} (bit/s/Hz)
versus $E_b/N_0$. Proportional fair scheduling (PFS) performs generally better
than the more restrictive HF system in the regime of low to moderate SNR, but
for high SNR an optimized HF system achieves throughput comparable to that of
PFS system for finite $K$. The hard-fairness system is interference limited. We
characterize this limit and validate a commonly used simplified model that
treats outer cell interference power as proportional to the in-cell total power
and we analytically characterize the proportionality constant. In contrast, the
spectral efficiency of PFS can grow unbounded for $K \to \infty$ thanks to the
multiuser diversity effect. We also show that partial frequency/time reuse can
mitigate the throughput penalty of the HF system, especially at high SNR.

of the constant baryon mass and/or the constant magnetic flux, which model the
evolution of an isolated neutron star as it loses angular momentum via the
gravitational waves. Important properties of the equilibrium configurations of
the magnetized stars obtained in this study are summarized as follows ; (1) For
the non-rotating stars, the matter distribution of the stars is prolately
distorted due to the toroidal magnetic fields. (2) For the rapidly rotating
stars, the shape of the stellar surface becomes oblate because of the
centrifugal force. But, the matter distribution deep inside the star is
sufficiently prolate for the mean matter distribution of the star to be
prolate. (3) The stronger toroidal magnetic fields lead to the mass-shedding of
the stars at the lower angular velocity. (4) For some equilibrium sequences of
the constant baryon mass and magnetic flux, the stars can spin up as they lose
angular momentum.

$Ag$) atoms. Analysis of bond-length, average formation energy, heat of
formation of $Ag_{27}Cu_{7}$ and $L1_2$ $Ag-Cu$ alloys provide an explanation
for the relative stability of the former with respect to the other nanoalloys
in the same family. The HOMO-LUMO gap is found to be 0.77 eV, in agreement with
previous results. Analysis of the DOS of $Ag_{27}Cu_{7}$, $L1_2$ $Ag-Cu$ alloys
and related systems provides insight into the effects of low coordination,
contraction/expansion and the presence of foreign atoms on the DOS of $Cu$ and
$Ag$. While some characteristics of the DOS are reminiscent of those of the
phonon-stable $L1_2$ $Ag-Cu$ alloys, the $Cu$ and $Ag$ states hybridize
significantly in $Ag_{27}Cu_{7}$, compensating the $d$-band narrowing that each
atom undergoes and hindering the dip in the DOS found in the bulk alloys.
Charge density plots of $Ag_{27}Cu_{7}$ provide further insights into the
relative strengths of the various interatomic bonds. Our results for the
electronic and geometric structure of this nanoalloy can be explained in terms
of length and strength hierarchies of the bonds, which may have implications
also for the stability of alloy in any phase or size.

which takes into account correlations. The new rate K = KMF + KC is the sum of
two terms. The first term is the known Smoluchowski rate with the mean-field
approximation. The second takes into account a correlation between clusters.
For this purpose we introduce the average path of a cluster. We relate the
length of this path to the reaction rate of the Smoluchowski equation. We solve
the implicit dependence between the average path and the density of clusters.
We show that this correlation length is the same for all clusters. Our result
depends strongly on the spatial dimension d. The mean-field term KMFi,j = (Di +
Dj)(rj + ri)d-2, which vanishes for d = 1 and is valid up to logarithmic
correction for d = 2, is the usual rate found with the Smoluchowski model
without correlation (where ri is the radius and Di is the diffusion constant of
the cluster). We compute a new rate: the correlation rate K_{i,j}^{C}
(D_i+D_j)(r_j+r_i)^{d-1}M{\big(\frac{d-1}{d_f}}\big) is valid for d \leq
1(where M(\alpha) = \sum+\infty i=1i\alphaNi is the moment of the density of
clusters and df is the fractal dimension of the cluster). The result is valid
for a large class of diffusion processes and mass radius relations. This

coupled with the BLS detection algorithm demonstrated the best performance
during the first CoRoT blind test. We apply a Monte Carlo approach by
simulating a large number of light curves of duration 150 days for different
values of planetary radius, orbital period, epoch of the first transit, and
standard deviation of the photon shot noise. Stellar variability is assumed in
all the cases to be given by the Total Solar Irradiance variations as observed
close to the maximum of solar cycle 23. After fitting solar variability,
transits are searched for by means of the BLS algorithm. We find that a model
based on three point-like active regions is better suited than a best fit with
a linear combination of 200 harmonic functions to reduce the impact of stellar
microvariability provided that the standard deviation of the noise is 2-4 times
larger than the central depth of the transits. On the other hand, the
200-harmonic fit is better when the standard deviation of the noise is
comparable to the transit depth. Our results show the advantage of a model
including a simple but physically motivated treatment of stellar
microvariability for the detection of planetary transits when the standard
deviation of the photon shot noise is greater than the transit depth and
stellar variability is analogous to solar irradiance variations.

to derive the Dyson equation for the Green's function of the inhomogeneous
system. Very different areas of physics such as, for example, electrodynamics
and quantum transport, can profit from this Green's function formalism. The
fundamental homogeneous-medium Green's tensor of electrodynamics is deduced
from the field of a dipole. Based upon that a numerical procedure is presented
to solve the wave-equation for the near-field in a scattering setup for
arbitrary material distributions. The full inhomogeneous system's Green's
function is not explicitly needed to get the fields, although it can be
obtained by a very similar calculation and in optics can be interpreted as a
density of states. It is demonstrated how the transport problem for two open
free-electron gas reservoirs with arbitrary coupling can be solved by finding
the system's Green's function. In this sense the article is an introduction on
Green's functions for treating interaction. A very detailed discussion of the

different types of galaxies using kinematic pairs selected from the DEEP2
Redshift Survey. By parameterizing the evolution of the pair fraction as
(1+z)^{m}, we find that the companion rate increases mildly with redshift with
m = 0.41+-0.20 for all galaxies with -21 < M_B^{e} < -19. Blue galaxies show
slightly faster evolution in the blue companion rate with m = 1.27+-0.35 while
red galaxies have had fewer red companions in the past as evidenced by the
negative slope m = -0.92+-0.59. We find that at low redshift the pair fraction
within the red sequence exceeds that of the blue cloud, indicating a higher
merger probability among red galaxies compared to that among the blue galaxies.
With further assumptions on the merger timescale and the fraction of pairs that
will merge, the galaxy major merger rates for 0.1 < z <1.2 are estimated to be
~10^{-3}h^{3}Mpc^{-3}Gyr^{-1} with a factor of 2 uncertainty. At z ~ 1.1, 68%
of mergers are wet, 8% of mergers are dry, and 24% of mergers are mixed,
compared to 31% wet mergers, 25% dry mergers, and 44% mixed mergers at z ~ 0.1.
The growth of dry merger rates with decreasing redshift is mainly due to the
increase in the co-moving number density of red galaxies over time. About 22%
to 54% of present-day L^{*} galaxies have experienced major mergers since z ~
1.2, depending on the definition of major mergers. Moreover, 24% of the red
galaxies at the present epoch have had dry mergers with luminosity ratios
between 1:4 and 4:1 since z ~ 1. Our results also suggest that the wet mergers
and/or mixed mergers may be partially responsible for producing red galaxies
with intermediate masses while a significant portion of massive red galaxies is
assembled through dry mergers at later times.

The shape of the SEDs during the outburst appears peculiarly wavy because of an
optical excess and a UV drop-and-rise. The optical light curve is well sampled

systems with low specific star formation rate (SSFR) suffer a lower UV
attenuation than starbursts. Using a sample of nearby field and cluster spiral

A(UV) relation leads to a systematic overestimate up to 2 magnitudes of the
amount of UV dust attenuation suffered by objects with low SSFR and in
particular HI-deficient star forming cluster galaxies. This result points out
that the age independent $TIR/UV$ vs. $A(UV)$ relation cannot be used to study
the UV properties of large samples of galaxies including low star-forming
systems and passive spirals. Therefore we give some simple empirical relations
from which the UV attenuation can be estimated taking into account its

spatio-temporal chaotic state when coupled above a critical strength. As a
prototype of each single spatio-temporal chaotic system a lattice of maps
interacting via power-law coupling is considered. The synchronization
transition is studied as a non-equilibrium phase transition, and its critical
properties are analyzed at varying the spatial interaction range as well as the
nonlinearity of the dynamical units composing each system. In particular,
continuous and discontinuous local maps are considered. In both cases the
transitions are of the second order with critical indexes varying with the
exponent characterizing the interaction range. For discontinuous maps it is
numerically shown that the transition belongs to the {\it anomalous directed
percolation} (ADP) family of universality classes, previously identified for
L{\'e}vy-flight spreading of epidemic processes. For continuous maps, the
critical exponents are different from those characterizing ADP, but apart from
the nearest-neighbor case, the identification of the corresponding universality
classes remains an open problem. Finally, to test the influence of
deterministic correlations for the studied synchronization transitions, the
chaotic dynamical evolutions are substituted by suitable stochastic models. In
this framework and for the discontinuous case, it is possible to derive an
effective Langevin description that corresponds to that proposed for ADP.

nebula and is nowadays generally considered to be a compact HII region. To
investigate the nature M1-78 further, we present a detailed spectroscopic study
of M1-78 in the optical and near-infrared. M1-78 is a high-density nebula with
substantial physical differences between its two main morphological zones: a
bright arc to the SW and a blob of emission in the NE. Specifically, the blob
in the NE has a higher electron temperature and visual extinction than the SW
arc. The most important result, however, is the confirmation of a nitrogen
enrichment in M1-78. This enrichment is stronger at the location of the NE blob
and is correlated with a defficiency in the O abundance and a (dubious) He
enrichment. Such an abundance pattern is typical of ejecta nebulae around
evolved massive stars such as Wolf-Rayet and Luminous Blue Variable stars. The
spatial variations in the physical conditions and chemical abundances and the
presence of more than one possible ionizing source indicates, however, that
M1-78 is better described as a combination of a compact HII region + ejecta.
Finally, we detect H2 emission that extends over a large (~30 arcsec) area
around the ionized nebula. Analysis of the near-infrared H2 lines indicates
that the excitation mechanism is UV fluorescence.

for central and linear rotational states is considered. This problem is
important for applications of these model to describing baryons, glueballs or
other exotic hadrons. The linear rotational state correspond to an uniform
rotation of the system with rectilinear string segments, connecting massive
points. The state is named ``central'' one, if there is a massive point at the
rotational center. It is shown that the linear rotational states with 2 massive
points are stable with respect to small disturbances. But the central
rotational states with 3 masses are not stable, if the central mass it less
than energy of the string with other massive points. This effect may change
properties of excited hadron states, in particular, increase their width.

Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems (FEPS) Legacy Science Program on
the Spitzer Space Telescope. Here we present a study of dust processing and
growth in seven protoplanetary disks. Our spectra indicate that the
circumstellar silicate dust grains have grown to sizes at least 10 times larger
than observed in the interstellar medium, and show evidence for a
non-negligible (~5 % in mass fractions) contribution from crystalline species.
These results are similar to those of other studies of protoplanetary disks. In
addition, we find a correlation between the strength of the amorphous silicate
feature and the shape of the spectral energy distribution. This latter result
is consistent with the growth and subsequent gravitational settling of dust
grains towards the disk mid-plane. Further, we find a change in the relative
abundance of the different crystalline species: more enstatite relative to
forsterite is observed in the inner warm dust population at ~1 AU, while
forsterite dominates in the colder outer regions at ~5 to 15 AU. This change in
the relative abundances argues for a localized crystallization process rather
than a radial mixing scenario where crystalline silicates are being transported
outwards from a single formation region in the hot inner parts of the disk.
Last, we report the detection of emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
molecules in five out of seven sources. We find a tentative PAH band at 8.2
micron, previously undetected in the spectra of disks around low-mass
pre-main-sequence stars.

elastic deflection model and thermal elastic model of micro beams buckling have
been established and simulated. Also, temperature dependent buckling of
polysilicon micro beam under high temperature has been modeled by Finite

On the other hand optical measurements of the modal responses of the sensor

the number of data accessing points as well as the scanning lines can be
greatly reduced for large array inkjet printheads with nozzles numbering more

multiplexing with the provision of a gating transistor for each ink firing
resistor, where ink firing resistors are triggered only by the selection of
their associated gating transistors. Three signals: selection (S), address (A),
and power supply (P), are employed together to activate a nozzle for droplet

covariance algorithm to reject the signal that does not contain the code. The
trade-off between the sine wave rejection ratio of the technique and the test
time response is studied and, in the case of a MEMS accelerometer, it is
demonstrated that the rejection is higher than 14dB for a test time of about
0.7s. Furthermore, the accuracy of the test signal can be evaluated to

temperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this
investigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to
investigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process
temperature and load pressure. The depth of indentation was controlled and the
load force at a certain indentation depth was measured. Experiments were
carried out using 1 mm thick PMMA films with the process temperature ranging
from Tg-55 degrees C to Tg +20 degrees C. The embossed structures included a
single micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. It was found that at
temperature of Tg-55 degrees C, elastic deformation dominated the formation of
microstructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. From Tg-20
degrees C to Tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and
permanent cavities could be formed on PMMA substrates without obvious
relaxation. However, the formation of protrusive structures as micro pillars
was not complete since there was little polymer flow. With an increase in
process temperature, microstructure could be formed under lower loading
pressure. Considering the fidelity of a single microstructure and global
flatness of embossed substrates, micro hot embossing at a low process
temperature, but with good fidelity, should be preferred.

obtained in slits of width $D$ = $4 \div 10$ (in units of the bead radius) and

suspensions of monodisperse hard ellipsoids. In equilibrium, almost spherical
ellipsoids show a first order transition from an isotropic phase to a rotator
phase. When overcompressing the isotropic phase into the rotator regime, we
observe super-Arrhenius slowing down of diffusion and relaxation, accompanied
by two-step relaxation in positional and orientational correlators. The effects
are strong enough for asymptotic laws of mode-coupling theory to apply. Glassy
dynamics are unusual in monodisperse systems. Typically, polydispersity in size
or a mixture of particle species is prerequisite to prevent crystallization.
Here, we show that a slight particle anisometry acts as a sufficient source of
disorder. This sheds new light on the question of which ingredients are
required for glass formation.

emerging areas such as microarray data analysis. For microarray and other
high-dimensional data, the presence of many noise variables may mask underlying
clustering structures. Hence removing noise variables via variable selection is
necessary. For simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation,
existing penalized likelihood approaches in model-based clustering analysis all
assume a common diagonal covariance matrix across clusters, which however may
not hold in practice. To analyze high-dimensional data, particularly those with
relatively low sample sizes, this article introduces a novel approach that
shrinks the variances together with means, in a more general situation with
cluster-specific (diagonal) covariance matrices. Furthermore, selection of
grouped variables via inclusion or exclusion of a group of variables altogether
is permitted by a specific form of penalty, which facilitates incorporating
subject-matter knowledge, such as gene functions in clustering microarray
samples for disease subtype discovery. For implementation, EM algorithms are
derived for parameter estimation, in which the M-steps clearly demonstrate the
effects of shrinkage and thresholding. Numerical examples, including an
application to acute leukemia subtype discovery with microarray gene expression
data, are provided to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the proposed
method.

context of the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) as coming from neutralino
annihilation into mainly b-quarks in the galactic halo, with neutralino mass in
the vicinity of 50-70 GeV. We observe that in order to obtain the correct relic
abundance of neutralinos in accord with WMAP measurements, the corresponding
neutralino-proton direct detection (DD) rates should be in excess of recent
limits from the Xenon-10 collaboration. While it does not appear possible to
satisfy the Egret, WMAP and Xenon-10 constraints simultaneously within the
mSUGRA model, we find that it is easily possible in models with non-universal
Higgs soft masses (NUHM). In either case, gluino pair production from
m(gluino)\sim 400-500 GeV should occur at large rates at the CERN LHC, and a
gluino pair production signal should be visible with just 0.1 fb^{-1} of
integrated luminosity. The NUHM interpretation predicts a rather light spectrum
of heavy Higgs bosons with m_A\sim 140-200 GeV over the whole parameter space

just above 10^{-8} pb, within range of the next round of direct dark matter

  in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming, Cambridge University Press",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Disjunctive Logic Programming (DLP) is a very expressive formalism: it allows
for expressing every property of finite structures that is decidable in the
complexity class SigmaP2 (= NP^NP). Despite this high expressiveness, there are
some simple properties, often arising in real-world applications, which cannot
be encoded in a simple and natural manner. Especially properties that require
the use of arithmetic operators (like sum, times, or count) on a set or
multiset of elements, which satisfy some conditions, cannot be naturally
expressed in classic DLP.
  To overcome this deficiency, we extend DLP by aggregate functions in a
conservative way. In particular, we avoid the introduction of constructs with
disputed semantics, by requiring aggregates to be stratified. We formally
define the semantics of the extended language (called DLP^A), and illustrate
how it can be profitably used for representing knowledge. Furthermore, we
analyze the computational complexity of DLP^A, showing that the addition of
aggregates does not bring a higher cost in that respect. Finally, we provide an
implementation of DLP^A in DLV -- a state-of-the-art DLP system -- and report
on experiments which confirm the usefulness of the proposed extension also for
the efficiency of computation.

investigate the influence of solid boundaries on the Lagrangian dynamics. It is
found that the Lagrangian acceleration is even more intermittent in the
confined domain than in the periodic domain. The flatness of the Lagrangian
acceleration as a function of the radius shows that the influence of the wall
on the Lagrangian dynamics becomes negligible in the center of the domain and
it also reveals that the wall is responsible for the increased intermittency.
The transition in the Lagrangian statistics between this region, not directly
influenced by the walls, and a critical radius which defines a Lagrangian
boundary layer, is shown to be very sharp with a sudden increase of the
acceleration flatness from about 5 to about 20.

typically on the order of room temperature, membranes provide an unusual
opportunity in which to perform a quantitative study of biophysical systems
that exhibit critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising universality
class. As a critical point is approached from either high or low temperature,
the scale of fluctuations in lipid composition, set by the correlation length,
diverges. In addition, as a critical point is approached from low temperature,
the line tension between coexisting phases decreases to zero. Here we
quantitatively evaluate the temperature dependence of line tension between
liquid domains and of fluctuation correlation lengths in lipid membranes in
order to extract a critical exponent, nu. We obtain nu=1.2 plus or minus 0.2,
