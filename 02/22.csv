synthetic spectra to observations at high resolution (R~42000 and R~75000) and
high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. The abundances obtained do not exhibit any
clear correlation with the effective temperature nor the projected rotational
velocity. Interestingly, A stars exhibit larger star-to-star variations in C,
Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr and Ba than F stars. F stars exhibit solar
abundances for almost all the elements. In A stars, the abundances of Si, Ti
and Cr are found to be correlated with that of Fe, the [X/Fe] ratios being
solar for these three elements. The derived abundances have been compared to
the predictions of published evolutionary models at the age of Pleiades (100
Myr). For the F stars, the predicted slight underabundances of light elements
and overabundances of Cr, Fe and Ni are indeed confirmed by our findings. For A
stars, the predicted overabundances in iron peak elements are confirmed in a
few stars only. The large scatter of the abundances in A stars, already found
in the Hyades, Coma Berenices and the UMa group and in field stars appears to
be a characteristic property of dwarf A stars. The occurence of hydrodynamical
processes competing with radiative diffusion in the radiative zones of the A

suitable warm dark matter candidate. The majoron is the Goldstone boson
associated to the spontaneous breaking of ungauged lepton number, one of the
mechanisms proposed to give rise to neutrino masses. The majoron can acquire a
mass through quantum gravity effects, and can possibly account for the observed
dark matter component of the Universe. We present constraints on the majoron
lifetime, mass and abundance obtained by the analysis of the cosmic microwave
background data. We find that, in the case of thermal production, the limits
for the majoron mass read 0.12 keV<m_J<0.17 keV, and discuss how these limits
are modified in the non-thermal case. The majoron lifetime is constrained to be
larger than 250 Gyrs. We also apply this results to a given seesaw model for
the generation of neutrino masses, and find that this constraints the energy
scale for the lepton number breaking phase transition to be above 10^6 GeV. We
thus find that the majoron decaying dark matter (DDM) scenario fits nicely in
models where neutrino masses arise ""a la seesaw"" and may lead to other possible
cosmological implications.

result is that the [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratio, which provides a measure of the
hardness of the ionizing spectrum free from the major problems plaguing optical
line ratios, is enhanced in the extraplanar pointings relative to the disk
pointing. Using a 2D Monte Carlo-based photo-ionization code which accounts for
the effects of radiation field hardening, we find that this trend cannot be
reproduced by any plausible photo-ionization model, and that a secondary source
of ionization must therefore operate in gaseous halos. We also present the
first spectroscopic detections of extraplanar PAH features in an external
normal galaxy. If they are in an exponential layer, very rough emission
scale-heights of 330-530 pc are implied for the various features. Extinction
may be non-negligible in the midplane and reduce these scale-heights
significantly. There is little significant variation in the relative emission
from the various features between disk and extraplanar environment. Only the
17.4 micron feature is significantly enhanced in the extraplanar gas compared

energy effective actions of superstring theories. We argue on general grounds
that the most likely models of modular slow-roll inflation are small field
models in which the inflaton moves about a Planck distance from an extremum of
the potential. We then focus on models in which the inflaton is the bosonic
component of a single (complex) chiral superfield and explain the generic
difficulties in designing small field models of modular inflation. We then show
that if the Kaehler potential (KP) of the inflaton is logarithmic as in
perturbative string theories, then it is not possible to satisfy the slow-roll
conditions for any superpotential. We find that if the corrections to the KP
are large enough so it can be approximated by a canonical KP in the vicinity of
the extremum, then viable slow-roll inflation is possible. In this case,
several parameters have to be tuned to a fraction of a percent. We give a
prescription for designing successful small field supergravity models of
inflation when the KP is canonical and calculate the slow-roll parameters from
the superpotential parameters. Our results strengthen the case for models in
which the moduli slowly roll about a Planck distance from a relatively high
scale extremum that is located in the vicinity of the central region of moduli
space units. Generic models of this class predict a red spectrum of scalar
perturbations and negligible spectral index running. They also predict a
characteristic suppression of tensor perturbations despite the high scale of
inflation. Consequently, a detection of primordial tensor anisotropies or
spectral index running in cosmic microwave background observations in the
foreseeable future will rule out this entire class of modular inflation models.

(RRLs), from which one can derive the plasma conditions and the number of
massive stars formed in the burst, free of dust obscuration effects.
  Aims. We aimed to find RRL emission from additional starburst systems and to
use the line properties to estimate the properties of the ionized gas.
  Methods. We conducted a search for RRLs in the nearby extragalactic starburst
or Seyfert galaxies NGC 1808, the Circinus galaxy, NGC 4038/9, II Zw 40, NGC
6221, NGC 7552, IRAS 18325-5926, IC 5063, and VV 114. We used the VLA and the
ATCA to search for the RRLs H91alpha and H92alpha with rest frequencies of 8.6
GHz and 8.3 GHz.
  Results. We detected for the first time RRLs from the starburst nuclei in the
Circinus galaxy and NGC 1808. The Circinus galaxy was detected with a line
strength integrated over the source of 3.2 mJy, making it the fourth-strongest
extragalactic RRL emitter known at this frequency (after NGC 4945, M 82, and
NGC 253). The line and continuum emission can be matched by a model consisting
of a collection of 50 to 10 000 H II regions with 300 to 9000 O5 stars required
to maintain the ionization, inferring a star formation rate of 0.2 Msun/yr to 6
Msun/yr. NGC 1808 was detected in RRL emission at 3.9 sigma with a line
strength of 0.47 mJy at the expected velocity.
  Conclusion. We have detected RRLs from two galaxies, adding to the small but
growing number of known extragalactic RRL emitters. The Circinus galaxy is
strong and especially suited to high-quality follow-up spectroscopic study. We
derived conditions and star formation rates in the starbursting regions.
Uncertainties can be reduced by future multi-transition studies.

exciton-photon coupling is described in terms of polariton quasi-particles,
which are scattered by a disorder potential. We consider three kinds of
disorder: (a) inhomogeneous exciton energy, (b) inhomogeneous exciton-photon
coupling and (c) deviations from an ideal lattice. These three types of
disorder are characteristic of different physical systems, and their separate
analysis gives insight on the competition between randomness and light-matter
coupling. We consider conventional planar polariton structures (with excitons
resonant to photon modes emitting normal to the cavity) and Bragg polariton
structures, in which excitons in a lattice are resonant with photon modes at a
finite angle satisfying the Bragg condition. We calculate the absorption
spectra in the normal direction and at the Bragg angle by a direct
diagonalization of the exciton-photon Hamiltonian. We found that in some cases
weak disorder increases the light-matter coupling and leads to a larger
polariton splitting. Moreover, we found that the coupling of excitons and
photons is less sensitive to disorder of type (b) and (c). This suggests that
polaritonic structures realized with impurities in a semiconductor or with
atoms in optical lattices are good candidate for the observation of some of the

gravitational encounters should substantially affect their structure in 10 Gyr
or less. In nuclear star clusters without massive black holes, dynamical
evolution is a competition between core collapse, which causes densities to
increase, and heat input from the surrounding galaxy, which causes densities to
decrease. The maximum extent of a nucleus that can resist expansion is derived
numerically for a wide range of initial conditions; observed nuclei are shown
to be compact enough to resist expansion, although there may have been an
earlier generation of low-density nuclei that were dissolved. An evolutionary
model for NGC 205 is presented which suggests that the nucleus of this galaxy
has already undergone core collapse. Adding a massive black hole to a nucleus
inhibits core collapse, and nuclear star clusters with black holes always
expand, due primarily to heat input from the galaxy and secondarily to heating
from stellar disruptions. The expansion rate is smaller for larger black holes
due to the smaller temperature difference between galaxy and nucleus when the
black hole is large. The rate of stellar tidal disruptions and its variation
with time are computed for a variety of initial models. The disruption rate
generally decreases with time due to the evolving nuclear density, particularly
in the faintest galaxies, assuming that scaling relations derived for luminous
galaxies can be extended to low luminosities.

The possibility to run at the Upsilon(5S) is also very briefly discussed; in
principle, this could provide very clean measurements of B_s decays. The
strength and reach of a SFF is most notably due to the possibility of examining
an impressive array of very clean observables. The angles and the sides of the
unitarity triangle can be determined with unprecedented accuracy. These serve
as a reference for New Physics (NP) sensitive decays such as B^+ ->tau^+ nu and
penguin dominated hadronic decay modes, providing tests of generic NP scenarios
with an accuracy of a few percent. Besides, very precise studies of direct and
time dependent CP asymmetries in radiative B decays and forward-backward
asymmetry studies in B-> X_s l^+ l^- and numerous null tests using B, charm and
tau decays are also likely to provide powerful insights into NP. The dramatic
increase in luminosity at a SFF will also open up entirely new avenues for
probing NP observables, e.g. by allowing sensitive studies using theoretically
clean processes such as B -> X_s nu nubar. The SFF is envisioned to be a
crucial tool for essential studies of flavor in the LHC era, and will extend
the reach of the LHC in many important ways.

involved in the formation of such clusters in a variety of environments.
Population synthesis models cannot, however, be applied blindy to such systems.
We show that synthesis models cannot be used in the usual straightforward way
to small-mass clusters (say, M < few times 10**4 Mo). The reason is that the
basic hypothesis underlying population synthesis (a fixed proportionality
between the number of stars in the different evolutionary phases) is not
fulfilled in these clusters due to their small number of stars. This incomplete
sampling of the stellar mass function results in a non-gaussian distribution of
the mass-luminosity ratio for clusters that share the same evolutionary
conditions (age, metallicity and initial stellar mass distribution function).
We review some tests that can be carried out a priori to check whether a given
cluster can be analysed with the fully-sampled standard population synthesis
models, or, on the contrary, a probabilistic framework must be used. This leads
to a re-assessment in the estimation of the low-mass tail in the distribution
function of initial masses of stellar clusters.

expansion violates the higher-dimensional null energy condition (NEC) if the
compactification manifold M is one-dimensional, if its intrinsic Ricci scalar R

inflation and generically have the remarkable property that slow roll inflation
can proceed even with an extremely steep potential. Previous calculations found
that large nongaussianity is possible; however, the technical complications

showing that a particular choice of field basis and recent progress in
cosmological perturbation theory makes an exact computation possible. We
provide the first quantitatively accurate computation of the bispectrum in
nonlocal inflation, confirming our previous claim that it can be observably

goal is to better characterize the supernova population, with a particular
focus on SNe Ia, improving their utility as cosmological distance indicators
and as probes of dark energy. Our supernova spectroscopy program features
rapid-response observations using telescopes of a range of apertures, and
provides confirmation of the supernova and host-galaxy types as well as precise
redshifts. We describe here the target identification and prioritization, data
reduction, redshift measurement, and classification of 129 SNe Ia, 16
spectroscopically probable SNe Ia, 7 SNe Ib/c, and 11 SNe II from the first
season. We also describe our efforts to measure and remove the substantial host

vortex matter in three dimensions at finite temperatures in quantum fluids is
based on an assumption of an extended and homogeneous system. It is well known
not to be the case in actual Bose--Einstein condensates in traps which are
finite systems with nonuniform density. This raises the question to what extent
one can speak of different aggregate states of vortex matter (vortex lattices,
liquids and tensionless vortex tangle) in these system. To address this point,
in the present work we focus on the finite-size, boundaries and density
inhomogeneity effects on thermal vortex matter in a Bose--Einstein condensate.
To this end we perform Monte Carlo simulations on a model system describing
trapped Bose--Einstein condensates. Throughout the paper, we draw on analogies
with results for vortex matter obtained for extended systems. This work
suggests that finiteness and intrinsic inhomogeneity of the system not
withstanding, one nonetheless can approximately invoke the notion of distinct
aggregate states of vortex matter realized at certain length scales. This might
be helpful, in particular in search of possible new states of vortex matter in
Bose--Einstein condensates with multiple components and different symmetries.

fields are thought to be necessary for jet formation in many systems, but a
longstanding puzzle is that the turbulence which is responsible for inward disk
accretion should be even more efficient at causing a large-scale magnetic field
to diffuse outward; it just doesn't seem possible to build up a strong field in
the inner disk through advection of a weak one from outside. Here, we report
theoretical work which challenges this conventional wisdom and shows that the
surface layer of the disk (which is nonturbulent) can easily advect magnetic
fields inward. This opens up the possibility for more diverse and robust jet
formation than is seen in numerical simulations which assume that the
large-scale field must be generated entirely via a dynamo within the inner
disk. In addition, strong disk turbulence (as inferred from observations) can
naturally be explained by the magnetorotational instability feeding off a
large-scale magnetic field anchored in the surface layer.

fourth power of the wavelength (lambda^-4). Assuming an extinction dominated by
Rayleigh scattering, we derive an atmospheric temperature of 1340+/-150 K. If
molecular hydrogen is responsible for the Rayleigh scattering, the atmospheric
pressure at the planetary characteristic radius of 0.1564 stellar radius must
be 410+/-30 mbar. However the preferred scenario is scattering by condensate
particles. Using the Mie approximation, we find that the particles must have a
low value for the imaginary part of the refraction index. We identify MgSiO3 as
a possible abundant condensate whose particle size must be between 0.01 and 0.1
microns. For this condensate, assuming solar abundance, the pressure at 0.1564
stellar radius is found to be between a few microbars and few millibars, and

explored in the literature in two main ways: firstly in a variety of explicit

introduces a third approach, intended to complement the other two. It describes
a simple toy model, which, under a natural interpretation, shows how
retrocausality can emerge from simple global constraints. The model is also
useful in permitting a clear distinction between the kind of retrocausality
likely to be of interest in QM, and a different kind of reverse causality, with
which it is liable to be confused. The model is proposed in the hope that
future elaborations might throw light on the potential of retrocausality to
account for quantum phenomena.

treat Coulomb interactions in simulations of ionic fluids. LMF theory relies on
splitting the Coulomb potential into a short-ranged part that combines with
other short-ranged core interactions and is simulated explicitly. The averaged
effects of the remaining long-ranged part are taken into account through a
self-consistently determined effective external field. The theory contains an
adjustable length parameter sigma that specifies the cut-off distance for the
short-ranged interaction. This can be chosen to minimize the errors resulting
from the mean-field treatment of the complementary long-ranged part. Here we
suggest that in many cases an accurate approximation to the effective field can
be obtained directly from the equilibrium charge density given by the Debye
theory of screening, thus eliminating the need for a self-consistent treatment.
In the limit sigma -> 0, this assumption reduces to the classical Debye
approximation. We examine the numerical performance of this approximation for a
simple model of a symmetric ionic mixture. Our results for thermodynamic and
structural properties of uniform ionic mixtures agree well with similar results
of Ewald simulations of the full ionic system. In addition we have used the
simplified theory in a grand-canonical simulation of a nonuniform ionic mixture
where an ion has been fixed at the origin. Simulations using short-ranged
truncations of the Coulomb interactions alone do not satisfy the exact
condition of complete screening of the fixed ion, but this condition is
recovered when the effective field is taken into account. We argue that this
simplified approach can also be used in the simulations of more complex
nonuniform systems.

second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible

conditions, accreted mass, stellar curvature, and (briefly) toroidal magnetic
field strength. We find that axisymmetric equilibria are susceptible to the
undular sub-mode of the Parker instability but are not disrupted. The
line-tying boundary condition at the stellar surface is crucial in stabilizing
the mountain. The nonlinear three-dimensional saturation state of the
instability is characterized by a small degree of nonaxisymmetry ($\la 0.1$ per
cent) and a mass ellipticity of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-5}$ for an accreted mass of
$M_a = 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Hence there is a good prospect of detecting
gravitational waves from accreting millisecond pulsars with long-baseline
interferometers such as Advanced LIGO. We also investigate the ideal-MHD
spectrum of the system, finding that long-wavelength poloidal modes are
suppressed in favour of toroidal modes in the nonaxisymmetric saturation state.

by the seesaw mechanism. Rich phenomenology is generally expected if the heavy
neutrinos are not much heavier than the electroweak scale. A model with this
feature built in has been suggested recently by Hung. The model keeps the
standard gauge group but introduces chirality-flipped partners for the
fermions. In particular, a right-handed neutrino forms a weak doublet with a
charged heavy lepton, and is thus active. We analyze the lepton flavor
structure in gauge interactions. The mixing matrices in charged currents (CC)
are generally non-unitary, and their deviation from unitarity induces flavor
changing neutral currents (FCNC). We calculate the branching ratios for the
rare decays \mu\to e\gamma and \mu\to ee\bar e due to the gauge interactions.
Although the former is generally smaller than the latter by three orders of
magnitude, parameter regions exist in which \mu\to e\gamma is reachable in the
next generation of experiments even if the current stringent bound on \mu\to
ee\bar e is taken into account. If light neutrinos dominate for \mu\to e\gamma,
the latter cannot set a meaningful bound on unitarity violation in the mixing
matrix of light leptons due to significant cancelation between CC and FCNC
contributions. Instead, the role is taken over by the decay \mu\to ee\bar e.

analyzed with the aim to update the fundamental parameters of this

field star contamination. Among the 40 stars with spectra, we identified 21
{\it bona fide} radial velocity members which allow us to put more solid
constraints on the cluster's metal abundance, long suggested to be as low as
the metallicity of globulars. As indicated earlier by us on a purely
photometric basis (Carraro et al. 2002), the cluster [Fe/H] abundance is
slightly super-solar ([Fe/H] =0.16$\pm$0.03) and close to the Hyades value, as
inferred from a detailed abundance analysis of 3 of the 5 stars with higher
resolution spectra. Abundance ratios are also marginally super solar. Based on
this result, we revise the properties of NGC 2112 using stellar models from the
Padova and Yale-Yonsei groups. For this metal abundance, we find the cluster's
age, reddening, and distance values are 1.8 Gyr, 0.60 mag, and 940 pc,
respectively. Both the Yale-Yonsei and Padova models predict the same values
for the fundamental parameters within the errors. Overall, NGC 2112 is a
typical solar neighborhood, thin disk star cluster, sharing the same chemical
properties of F-G stars and open clusters close to the Sun. This investigation
outlines the importance of a detailed membership analysis in the study of disk
star clusters.

the particular case of annihilation into two monochromatic photons in the

well-developed to increase fading channel capacity over single-input
single-output (SISO) systems. This capacity gain can often be leveraged by
utilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. Users
make use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. In
this correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the MIMO multiple access
channel (MIMO MAC) when partial channel state information is available at the
transmitters, where we assume a synchronous MIMO multiuser uplink. The partial
channel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back
from the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. Using
this feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to
maximize sum-rate. In this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit
signal covariance matrices. We also derive the capacity region and codebook
design methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank-one (i.e.,
beamforming). This is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in
certain conditions. The simulation results show that when the number of
feedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. Even with a small number
of feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal
solution with the full feedback.

energy-dependence of the nucleon self-energies in the relativistic Hartree-Fock
(RHF) approximation in off-mass-shell states. Then we demonstrate that the
antinucleon appearing in low energy observables is in the off-mass-shell energy
region and its properties are quite different from that at the on-mass-shell
state. Furthermore we show that the quenched amount of the GT strength is not
taken only by the \NNbar production but also by the meson production through
the imaginary part of the nucleon self-energy in the RHF approximation.

process continues for up to n rounds where n is the total number of nodes
initially in the network: the adversary deletes an arbitrary node from the
network, then the network responds by quickly adding a small number of new
edges.
  We present a distributed data structure that ensures two key properties.
First, the diameter of the network is never more than $O(\log \Delta)$ times
its original diameter, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the network
initially. We note that for many peer-to-peer systems, $\Delta$ is
polylogarithmic, so the diameter increase would be a O(log log n)
multiplicative factor. Second, the degree of any node never increases by more
than 3 over its original degree. Our data structure is fully distributed, has
O(1) latency per round and requires each node to send and receive O(1) messages
per round. The data structure requires an initial setup phase that has latency
equal to the diameter of the original network, and requires, with high
probability, each node v to send O(log n) messages along every edge incident to
v. Our approach is orthogonal and complementary to traditional topology-based
approaches to defending against attack.

of species for a broad spectrum of resources. Recent studies have shown that
essentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving
competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum,
or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of
species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space.
Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel,
which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing
species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition
kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian
assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case
scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform
or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the
Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard
competition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped
species distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary
mechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model. We
analyze the origin of this sensitivity and discuss it in the context of recent
applications of the model.

indicate that the masses based on model atmospheres can be much larger than the
masses derived from theoretical mass-luminosity relations. Also, the dispersion
in the relation between the modified wind momentum and the luminosity depends
on the mass spread of the CSPN, and is larger than observed in massive hot
stars. Since the wind characteristics probably depend on the metallicity, we
analyze the effects on the modified wind momentum by considering the dispersion
in this quantity caused by the stellar metallicity. Our CSPN masses are based
on a relation between the core mass and the nebular abundances. We conclude
that these masses agree with the known mass distribution both for CSPN and
white dwarfs, and that the spread in the modified wind momentum can be
explained by the observed metallicity variations.

density simultaneously at different temperatures.
  Aims: MethodsWe study the density structure and characterise plasma in active
regions and associated moss regions. In addition we study its relationship to
the photospheric magnetic field.
  Methods: We used data recorded by the EIS, together with magnetic field
measurements from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard SoHO and images
recorded with the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and X-Ray
Telescope (XRT/Hinode).
  Results: We find that the hot core of the active region is densest with
values as high as 10^10.5 cm^-3. The electron density estimated in specific
regions in the active region moss decreases with increasing temperature. The
moss areas were located primarily on one side of the active region, and they
map the positive polarity regions almost exactly. The density within the moss

is how to extract physical information from any solution or class of solutions
to the Einstein equations. Though certain information can be obtained for
arbitrary solutions, e.g., via geodesic deviation, in general, because of the
coordinate freedom, it is often hard or impossible to do. Most of the time
information is found from special conditions, e.g., degenerate principle null
vectors, weak fields close to Minkowski space (using coordinates close to
Minkowski coordinates) or from solutions that have symmetries or approximate
symmetries. In the present work we will be concerned with asymptotically flat
space times where the approximate symmetry is the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS)
group. For these spaces the Bondi four-momentum vector and its evolution, found
from the Weyl tensor at infinity, describes the total energy-momentum of the
interior source and the energy-momentum radiated. By generalizing the
structures (shear-free null geodesic congruences) associated with the
algebraically special metrics to asymptotically shear-free null geodesic
congruences, which are available in all asymptotically flat space-times, we
give kinematic meaning to the Bondi four-momentum. In other words we describe
the Bondi vector and its evolution in terms of a center of mass position
vector, its velocity and a spin-vector, all having clear geometric meaning.
Among other items, from dynamic arguments, we define a unique (at our level of
approximation) total angular momentum and extract its evolution equation in the
form of a conservation law with an angular momentum flux.

carbonaceous dust grains is investigated in detail. The goal of this study is
to estimate the importance of the chemistry occuring on grain surfaces for the
deuteration of H2. Furthermore, we aim to find a robust and general surface
chemical model which can be used in different astrophysical environments.
Methods: Surface processes are described for the cases of graphitic and
amorphous--carbon grains, where laboratory work is available.
Langmuir--Hinshelwood as well as Eley--Rideal surface chemistries are included
in the model and their relative contributions are highlighted. Analytic
expressions are derived for H2, HD, and D2 formation efficiencies for both type
of grains. Rate equations are tested against stochastic methods. Results: As
expected, rate equations and stochastic methods diverge for grain sizes lower
than a critical value acrit. For grain sizes below this critical value, D2
formation decreases to favour HD formation. The formation efficiencies of H2
and D2 can be calculated by adding a correction factor to the rate equations
methods. We found that because of the presence of chemisorbed sites, which can
store atoms to form molecules up to high grain temperatures, the formation
efficiency of HD and D2 is very high compared to models where only
physisorption sites are taken into account. When considering a realistic
distribution of dust grains, we found that the formation rate of H2 and HD is
enhanced by an order of magnitude if small grains are taken into account. The
processes described in this paper, that allow a strong enhancement of the
deuterated forms of molecular hydrogen, could explain the high degree of
deuterium fractionation observed in protostellar environments.

barrier, we consider a very simplified two-component coagulation-fragmentation
model that consists of macroscopic boulders and smaller dust grains, the latter
being the result of catastrophic collisions between the boulders. Boulders in
turn increase their radii by sweeping up the dust fragments. An analytical
solution to the dynamical equations predicts that growth by
coagulation-fragmentation can be efficient and allow agglomeration of
10-meter-sized objects within the time-scale of the radial drift. These results
are supported by computer simulations of the motion of boulders and fragments
in 3-D time-dependent magnetorotational turbulence. Allowing however the
fragments to diffuse freely out of the sedimentary layer of boulders reduces
the density of both boulders and fragments in the mid-plane, and thus also the
growth of the boulder radius, drastically. The reason is that the turbulent
diffusion time-scale is so much shorter than the collisional time-scale that
dust fragments leak out of the mid-plane layer before they can be swept up by
the boulders there. Our conclusion that coagulation-fragmentation is not an
efficient way to grow across the meter barrier in fully turbulent
protoplanetary discs confirms recent results by Brauer, Dullemond, & Henning
who solved the coagulation equation in a parameterised turbulence model with
collisional fragmentation, cratering, radial drift, and a range of particle
sizes. We find that a relatively small population of boulders in a sedimentary
mid-plane layer can populate the entire vertical extent of the disc with small
grains and that these grains are not first generation dust, but have been
through several agglomeration-destruction cycles during the simulations.

interferometer featuring an achromatic phase shift of pi on broad range. A new
concept for designing such an achromatic phase shifter is presented here. The
major interest of this solution is that it allows a simple design, with
essentially one device per beam. The heart of the system consists in two
cellular mirrors where each cell has a thickness introducing for the central
wavelength, a phase shift of (2k+1)pi or of 2k pi on the fraction of the wave
it reflects. Each mirror is put in one of the collimated beams of the
interferometer. Because of the odd/even distribution, when recombining the two
beams, a destructive interference is produced on axis for the central
wavelength . If the distribution of cells thickness follows a rather simple
law, based on the Pascal's triangle, then the nulling is also efficient for a
wavelength not too far from the central wavelength. For instance, with two
mirrors of 64x64 cells, one reaches a nulling of 1.e-6 on more than one
complete octave. This could satisfy the specifications of space mission as
Darwin. We also show the way to distribute the cells in the plane of the pupil
for the optimum isolation of the planet image from the residual. We present the
nulling performances of those various configurations.

plasticity point of view, the evolution of the residual densification with the
maximum pressure of a pressure cycle can be discussed as a density hardening

the glass structure could be labelled by the maximum pressure experienced by

quantum structures. A bosonization scheme is applied including the full spin
structure. For generating the effective interaction potentials, the
Hartree-Fock and Heitler-London approaches are improved by a full two-exciton
calculation which includes the van der Waals effect. With these potentials the
biexciton formation in bilayer systems is investigated. For coupled quantum
wells the two-body scattering matrix is calculated and employed to give a
modified relation between exciton density and blue shift. Such a relation is of
central importance for gauging exciton densities in experiments which pave the
way toward Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons.

the Gowdy $S^1\times S^2$ and $S^3$ cosmologies are encoded in an axisymmetric
field on the sphere $S^2$. Recently, it has been shown that a standard field
parametrization of these reduced models admits no Fock quantization with a
unitary dynamics. This lack of unitarity is surpassed by a convenient
redefinition of the field and the choice of an adequate complex structure. The
result is a Fock quantization where both the dynamics and the SO(3)-symmetries
of the field equations are unitarily implemented. The present work proves that
this Fock representation is in fact unique inasmuch as, up to equivalence,
there exists no other possible choice of SO(3)-invariant complex structure
leading to a unitary implementation of the time evolution.

coupled non-equilibrium polariton condensates within mean field theory. An
analytical condition for the existence of a synchronized phase is derived for
two coupled wells. The case of many wells in a 2D disordered geometry is
studied numerically. The relation to recent experiments on polariton
condensation in CdTe microcavities is discussed.
