plasmas can self-consistently accelerate particles. We use long-term
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to study the well-developed shock
structure in unmagnetized pair plasma. The particle spectrum downstream of such
a shock consists of two components: a relativistic Maxwellian, with
characteristic temperature set by the upstream kinetic energy of the flow, and
a high-energy tail, extending to energies >100 times that of the thermal peak.
This tail is best fitted as a power law in energy with index -2.4+-0.1,
modified by an exponential cutoff. The cutoff moves to higher energies with
time of the simulation, leaving a larger power law range. The number of
particles in the tail is ~1% of the downstream population, and they carry ~10%
of the kinetic energy in the downstream. Upon investigation of the trajectories
of particles in the tail, we find that the energy gains occur as particles
bounce between the upstream and downstream regions in the magnetic fields
generated by the Weibel instability. We compare this mechanism to the first
order Fermi acceleration, and set a lower limit on the efficiency of shock
acceleration process.

differences between fluid flows in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, suggesting that the

at 23 GHz where the signal-to-noise ratio is the highest and the estimate of
the CMB map is less critical. Our estimate of the synchrotron intensity is
based on an extrapolation of the Haslam 408 MHz data with a spatially varying
spectral index constrained by the WMAP 23 GHz polarization data and a
bi-symmetrical spiral model of the galactic magnetic field with a turbulent
part following a -5/3 power law spectrum. The 23 GHz polarization data are
found to be compatible with a magnetic field with a pitch angle p=-8.5 degrees
and an amplitude of the turbulent part of the magnetic field 0.57 times the
local value of the field, in agreement with what is found using rotation
measures of pulsars and polarized extinction by dust. The synchrotron spectral
index between 408 MHz and 23 GHz obtained from polarization data and our model
of the magnetic field has a mean value of Beta=-3.00 with a limited spatial
variation with a standard deviation of 0.06. When thermal dust, free-free and
synchrotron are removed from the WMAP intensity data, the residual anomalous
emission is highly correlated with thermal dust emission with a spectrum in
agreement with spinning dust models. Considering a classical model of the large
scale Galactic magnetic field, we show that the polarization data of WMAP are
in favor of a soft synchrotron intensity highly correlated with the 408 MHz
data. Furthermore the combination of the WMAP polarization and intensity data
brings strong evidence for the presence of unpolarized spinning dust emission

series expansions for this field are presented in this paper. The calculated
polar gravitomagnetic field of the sphere and that from the ideal dipole model
appear to coincide, but the field in the vicinity of the sphere may deviate.
The deduced field within the sphere strongly deviates from the ideal dipole
result. As an illustration, the gravitomagnetic precession rate (or
frame-dragging effect) of a gyroscope moving in the gravitomagnetic field from
a large rotating sphere is calculated. For the Gravity Probe B experiment the

dynamics on complex networks, such as transport processes or epidemic
outbreaks. In most cases, however, they have been studied from a fermionic
perspective, in which each vertex can be occupied by at most one particle.
While still useful, this approach suffers from some drawbacks, the most
important probably being the difficulty to implement reactions involving more
than two particles simultaneously. Here we introduce a general framework for
the study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which
there is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex
can host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time
heterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady
state and monotonously decaying processes. We analyze specific examples of both
behaviors within the class of one-species process, comparing the results
(whenever possible) with the corresponding fermionic counterparts. We find that
the time evolution and critical properties of the particle density are
independent of the fermionic or bosonic nature of the process, while
differences exist in the functional form of the density of occupied vertices in
a given degree class k. We implement a continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm,
well suited for general bosonic simulations, which allow us to confirm the
analytical predictions formulated within mean-field theory. Our results, both
at the theoretical and numerical level, can be easily generalized to tackle
more complex, multi-species, reaction-diffusion processes, and open a promising
path for a general study and classification of this kind of dynamical systems

imply that in order to prove convergence of variational methods over MPS, as
the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, one has to put more requirements than
just MPS ground states and a polynomial spectral gap.

images obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 aboard the Hubble

a weaker ionizing flux. We performed a photoionization modeling analysis of the
emission-line gas within a series of annuli, centered on the the central
continuum source, with inner radii from 13 to 90 pc. The gas is ionized by
radiation that has been attenuated by a relatively highly-ionized absorber
(HABS), which completely covers the central source, and a lower-ionization
absorber (LABS), which has a covering factor ranging from 0 to 1. We found that
the [O III]/[O II] ratios are well fit by assuming that, within each segment of
an annulus, some fraction of the NLR gas is completely within the shadow of
LABS, while the rest is irradiated by the continuum filtered only by HABS. This
suggests that the structure of the NLR is due to filtering of the ionizing
radiation by ionized gas, consistent with disk-wind models. One possible
scenario is that the low-ionization absorbers are dense knots of gas swept up
by a wind.

understanding of the accretion geometry when the sources are in the hard state.
In this state, the X-ray energy spectrum is dominated by a hard power-law
component and radio observations indicate the presence of a steady and powerful
compact jet. Although the common hard state picture is that the accretion disk
is truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole,
recent results for the recurrent transient GX 339-4 by Miller and co-workers
show evidence for optically thick material very close to the black hole's
innermost stable circular orbit. That work focused on an observation of GX
339-4 at a luminosity of about 5% of the Eddington limit and used parameters
from a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a soft, thermal
component as diagnostics. In this work, we use similar diagnostics, but extend
the study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% Ledd) using Swift and RXTE
observations of GX 339-4. We detect a thermal component with an inner disk
temperature of ~0.2 keV at 2.3% Ledd. We detect broad features due to iron
Kalpha that are likely related to reflection of hard X-rays off the optically
thick material. If these features are broadened by relativistic effects, they
indicate that optically thick material resides within 10 Rg down to 0.8% Ledd,
and the measurements are consistent with the inner radius of the disk remaining
at ~4 Rg down to this level. However, we also discuss an alternative model for
the broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is not
entirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. Finally, we
discuss the results in terms of recent theoretical work on the possibility that
material may condense to maintain an inner optically thick disk.

Levstein, Phys. Rev. B 72, 235410 (2005)] that under certain conditions these
CPMG sequences become spoiled by stimulated echoes. The presence of these

the direction of the external magnetic field (z-polarization), involving
spin-lattice relaxation times of several seconds. Hole burning experiments
confirm the presence of a highly inhomogeneous line and show that the flip-flop
processes are able to homogenize the line in times agreeing with those obtained
through a Hahn echo sequence. As expected, the decay of the stimulated echoes
is not sensitive to the quenching of the dipolar interaction through an MREV16
sequence, while the Hahn echo decay increases by a factor of 20. CPMG sequences
with hard pulses and different temporal windows clearly show the relevance of
the dipolar interaction in between the pulses for the generation of the long
tails. In particular, the more time the flip-flop is effective (longer
interpulse separation), the shorter are the characteristic times of the long
tails.

several observational features of these galaxies, such as a series of abundance
ratios and the stellar metallicities distributions. The Milky Way model adopts
the two-infall scenario, whereas the most important features of the models for
the dSph galaxies are the low star-formation rate and the occurrence of intense
galactic winds. We predict that the [s-r/Fe] ratios in dSphs are generally
different than the corresponding ratios in the Milky Way, at the same [Fe/H]
values. This is interpreted as a consequence of the time-delay model coupled
with different star formation histories. In particular, the star-formation is
less efficient in dSphs than in our Galaxy and it is influenced by strong
galactic winds. Our predictions are in very good agreement with the available
observational data. The time-delay model for the galactic chemical enrichment
coupled with different histories of star formation in different galaxies allow
us to succesfully interpret the observed differences in the abundance ratios of
s- and r- process elements, as well as of $\alpha$-elements in dSphs and in the

have performed the same analysis without general relativity, and obtained even
more orbits of large eccentricity for Mercury. We have performed as well a
direct integration of the planetary orbits, without averaging, for a dynamical
model that do not include the Moon or general relativity with 10 very close
initial conditions over 3 Gyr. The statistics obtained with this reduced set
are comparable to the statistics of the secular equations, and in particular we
obtain two trajectories for which the eccentricity of Mercury increases beyond
0.8 in less than 1.3 Gyr and 2.8 Gyr respectively. These strong instabilities
in the orbital motion of Mecury results from secular resonance beween the
perihelion of Jupiter and Mercury that are facilitated by the absence of
general relativity. The statistical analysis of the 1001 orbits of the secular
equations also provides probability density functions (PDF) for the
eccentricity and inclination of the terrestrial planets.

argued that the system is dynamically inhomogeneous, with short-range charge
and spin correlations that slowly evolve with MC time, producing the glassy
characteristics of the CMR state. The local density-of-states (LDOS) is also
investigated, and a pseudogap (PG) is found to exist in the CMR temperature
range. The width of the PG in the LDOS is calculated and directly compared with
recent scanning-tunneling-spectroscopy (STS) experimental results. The
agreement between our calculation and the experiment suggests that the
depletion of the conductance at low bias observed experimentally is a
reflection on the existence of a PG in the LDOS spectra, as opposed to a hard
gap. The apparent homogeneity observed via STS techniques could be caused by
the slow time characteristics of this probe. Faster experimental methods should
unveil a rather inhomogeneous state in the CMR regime, as already observed in
neutron scattering experiments.

examine its various one-parameter extensions where we relax the assumed
universality of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. Our goal is to
correlate relic-density-allowed parameter choices with expected phenomena in
direct, indirect and collider dark matter search experiments. For every
non-universal model, we first provide plots to facilitate the selection of
``dark-matter allowed'' parameter space points, and then present salient
features of each model with respect to searches at Tevatron, LHC and ILC and
also direct and indirect dark matter searches. We present benchmark scenarios
that allow one to compare and contrast the non-universal models with one
another and with the paradigm mSUGRA framework. We show that many implications
about sparticle properties and collider signals drawn from the analysis of the
relic density constraint within mSUGRA do not carry over to simple
one-parameter extensions of the mSUGRA framework. We find that in many
relic-density-consistent models, there is one (or more) detectable edge in the
invariant mass distribution of same-flavour, opposite sign dileptons in SUSY
cascade decay events at the LHC. Finally, we scan the parameter space of these
various models, requiring consistency with the LEP2 constraint on the chargino
mass, and with the observed relic density, and examine prospects for direct and
indirect dark matter detection. We find that in a large number of cases the
mechanism that causes the early universe neutralino annihilation rate to be
large (so as to produce the measured relic density) also enhances the direct
detection rate, and often also the rates for indirect detection of neutralino
dark matter.

most popular explanation for this ""infant mortality"" of young clusters is the
expulsion of natal gas by stellar winds and supernovae, which leaves up to 90%
of them unbound. A cluster disruption model has recently been proposed in which
this mass- independent disruption of clusters proceeds for another Gyr after
gas expulsion. In this scenario, the survival chances of massive clusters are
much smaller than in the traditional mass-dependent disruption models. The most
common way to study cluster disruption is to use the cluster age distribution,
which, however, can be heavily affected by incompleteness. To avoid this, we
introduce a new method, based on size-of-sample effects, namely the relation
between the most massive cluster, M_max, and the age range sampled. Assuming
that clusters are sampled from a power-law initial mass function, with index -2
and that the cluster formation rate is constant, M_max scales with the age
range sampled, such that the slope in a log(M_max) vs. log(age) plot is equal
to unity. This slope decreases if mass-independent disruption is included. For
90% mass-independent cluster disruption per age dex, the predicted slope is
zero. For the solar neighbourhood, SMC, LMC, M33, and M83, based on ages and
masses taken from the literature, we find slopes consistent with the expected
size-of-sample correlations for the first 100 Myr, hence ruling out the 90%
mass-independent cluster disruption scenario. For M51, however, the increase of
log(M_max) with log(age) is slightly shallower and for the Antennae galaxies it
is flat. This simple method shows that the formation and/or disruption of
clusters in the Antennae must have been very different from that of the other
galaxies studied here, so it should not be taken as a representative case.

two-dimensional ferromagnets with arbitrary spin S in a magnetic field are
investigated by a second-order Green-function theory. In addition, quantum
Monte Carlo simulations for S= 1/2 and S=1 are performed using the stochastic
series expansion method. A good agreement between the results of both
approaches is found. The field dependence of the position of the maximum in the
temperature dependence of the susceptibility fits well to a power law at low
fields and to a linear increase at high fields. The maximum height decreases
according to a power law in the whole field region. The longitudinal
correlation length may show an anomalous temperature dependence: a minimum
followed by a maximum with increasing temperature. Considering the specific
heat in one dimension and at low magnetic fields, two maxima in its temperature
dependence for both the S= 1/2 and S = 1 ferromagnets are found. For S>1 only
one maximum occurs, as in the two-dimensional ferromagnets. Relating the theory
to experiments on the S= 1/2 quasi-one-dimensional copper salt TMCuC

from pre-Swift surveys calls into question inferences based on pre-Swift

demonstrate a generalized method for treating data truncation in correlation
analyses and apply this method to Swift and pre-Swift data. Also, we show that
the $E_{\rm pk}$-$E_{\gamma}$ (""Ghirlanda"") correlation is effectively
independent of the GRB redshifts, which suggests its existence has little to do
with intrinsic physics. We suggest that a physically-based correlation,
manifest observationally, must show significantly reduced scatter in the rest
frame relative to the observer frame and must not persist if the assumed
redshifts are scattered. As with the $E_{\rm pk}$-$E_{\gamma}$ correlation, we
find that the pre-Swift, bright GRB $E_{\rm pk}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation of

result of N. Anantharaman and S. Nonnenmacher math-ph/0610019, arXiv:0704.1564
(with H. Koch), for Anosov geodesic flows the metric entropy of any
semiclassical measure must be bounded from below. The result seems to be
optimal for uniformly expanding systems, but not in general case, where it
might become even trivial if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is
strongly non-uniform. It has been conjectured by the same authors, that in
fact, a stronger bound (valid in general case) should hold.
  In the present work we consider such entropic bounds using the model of
quantized one-dimensional maps. For a certain class of non-uniformly expanding

rotating with the highest observed frequency of 1122Hz are studied using a
large set of equations of state (EOSs). These EOSs span various approaches and
their chemical composition vary from the nucleons to hyperons and quarks in
$\beta$-equilibrium. It is found that the properties of static CS, like, the
maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm max}^{\rm stat}$ and radius $R_{1.4}^{\rm
stat}$ corresponding to t he canonical mass and supramassive or
non-supramassive nature of the CS rotating at 1122 Hz are strongly correlated.
In particular, only those EOSs yield the CS rotating at 1122Hz to be
non-supramassive for which $\left (\frac{M_{\rm max}^{\rm stat}}{M_\odot}\right
)^{1/2} \left (\frac{10{\rm km}}{R_{1.4}^{\rm stat}})^{3/2} $ is greater than
unity. Suitable parametric form which can be used to split the $M_{\rm
max}^{\rm stat}$ $-$ $R_{1.4}^{\rm stat}$ plane into the regions of different
supramassive nature of the CS rotating at 1122Hz is presented. Currently
measured maximum gravitational mass 1.76$M_\odot$ of PSR J0437-4715 suggests
that the CS rotating at 1122Hz can be non-supramassive provided $R_{1.4}^{\rm
stat} \leqslant 12.4$ km.

higher redshifts. We determined the luminosity distances of 30 GRBs in $1.8 < z

access a point through a common channel with spectral spreading factor N. Each
bit is extended by a temporal spreading factor B and hopped on a BN-chip random
sequence that is spread in time and frequency. Each user multiplexes and
transmits B extended bits and the total channel load is alpha = K/N bits/s/Hz.
The linearly-complex LAS detectors detect the transmitted bits. We have
obtained that as B tends to infinity, if alpha < 1/2 - 1/(4ln2), each
transmitted bit achieves the single-bit bound in BER in high SNR regime as if
there was no interference bit. In simulation, when bit number BK >= 500, each
bit can approach the single-bit bound for alpha as high as 1 bit/s/Hz. In this
paper, we further propose the quasi-large sparse-sequence (QLSS) CDMA by
replacing the dense sequence in QLRS-CDMA with sparse sequence. Simulation
results show that when the nonzero chips are as few as 16, the BER is already
near that of QLRS-CDMA while the complexity is significantly reduced due to
sequence sparsity.

that a feed-forward loop (FFL) circuitry is a key component of many such
networks. This led to a study of the functional properties of different FFL
types, where the regulatory elements are transcription factors.
  Results: Here we investigate these properties when the mediating regulatory
element of the loop is a microRNA. We find that many of the FFL properties are
enhanced within this setup. We then proceed to identify all such FFLs in the D.
Melanogaster regulatory network. We observe that in FFLs rooted at the same
transcription factor there are significant correlations between the number of
predicted binding sites for the transcription factor and for the microRNA.
  Conclusions: Based on a modeling approach we suggest that these correlations
may be an outcome of the type of FFL preferred by the transcription factor.
This may help elucidate the type of regulation the TF confers.

equilibrium of the fluid in a electrohydrodynamic (EHD) convection problem is
investigated. The analytical study is one of bifurcation. This allows us to
regain the expression of the neutral surface in the classical case. The method
used in the numerical study is a Galerkin type spectral method based on
polynomials and it provides good results.
