4-dimensional general relativity. We argue that the usual simplicity constraint
must be supplemented by a constraint on holonomies and together they must be
inserted explicitly into the discretized path integral. At the same time, the
closure constraint must be relaxed so that the new constraint expresses
covariance of intertwiners assigned to tetrahedra by spin foam quantization. As
a result, the spin foam boundary states are shown to be realized in terms of
projected spin networks of the covariant loop approach to quantum gravity.

which can be made all-loop finite, both in the dimensionless (gauge and Yukawa
couplings) and dimensionful (soft supersymmetry breaking terms) sectors. This
remarkable property, based on the reduction of couplings at the quantum level,
provides a drastic reduction in the number of free parameters, which in turn
leads to an accurate prediction of the top quark mass in the dimensionless
sector, and predictions for the Higgs boson mass and the supersymmetric
spectrum in the dimensionful sector. Here we examine the predictions of two
such FUTs. Next we consider gauge theories defined in higher dimensions, where
the extra dimensions form a fuzzy space (a finite matrix manifold). We
reinterpret these gauge theories as four-dimensional theories with Kaluza-Klein
modes. We then perform a generalized a la Forgacs-Manton dimensional reduction.
We emphasize some striking features emerging such as (i)the appearance of
non-Abelian gauge theories in four dimensions starting from an Abelian gauge
theory in higher dimensions, (ii) the fact that the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the theory takes place entirely in the extra dimensions and (iii)
the renormalizability of the theory both in higher as well as in four
dimensions. Then reversing the above approach we present a renormalizable four
dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with a suitable multiplet of scalar fields,
which via spontaneous symmetry breaking dynamically develops extra dimensions
in the form of a fuzzy sphere $S^2_N$.

develop a theoretical construction that will aid in physically understanding
the relationship of known two-dimensional vortex dynamics to their
three-dimensional counterparts in Keplerian disks. Using asymptotic scaling
arguments varicose disturbances of a Keplerian disk are considered on radial
and vertical scales consistent with the height of the disk while the azimuthal
scales are the full $2\pi$ angular extent of the disk. The scalings lead to
dynamics which are radially geostrophic and vertically hydrostatic. It follows
that a potential vorticity quantity emerges and is shown to be conserved in a
Lagrangian sense. Uniform potential vorticity linear solutions are explored and
the theory is shown to contain an incarnation of the strato-rotational
instability under channel flow conditions. Linearized solutions of a single
defect on an infinite domain is developed and is shown to support a propagating
Rossby edgewave. Linear non-uniform potential vorticity solutions are also
developed and are shown to be similar in some respects to the dynamics of
strictly two-dimensional inviscid flows. Based on the framework of this theory,
arguments based on geophysical notions are presented to support the assertion
that the strato-rotational instability is in a generic class of
barotropic/baroclinic potential vorticity instabilities. Extensions of this
formalism are also proposed. The shallow water formulation achieved by the
asymptotic theory developed here opens a new approach to studying disk
dynamics.

networks are expected to provide broadband services parallel to their wired
counterparts in near future. To address this need, MIMO techniques, which are
capable of offering several-fold increase in capacity, hold significant
promise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad-hoc networks is based on
an implicit assumption that each node has only one antenna. Core to the
analysis therein is the characterization of a geometric area, referred to as
the exclusion region, which quantizes the amount of spatial resource occupied
by a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple
links can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as
interference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, a
link no longer exclusively occupies a geometric area, making the concept of
""exclusion region"" not applicable any more. In this paper, we investigate
link-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous
work, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by
the actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer
capacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR
at a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links
and the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our
analysis will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols
for MIMO ad-hoc networks. To the best of knowledge, this paper is the first
attempt to characterize the capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks by considering the
actual PHY-layer signal and interference model.

describe the freezeout stage of the space-time evolution of matter in
ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. Kinetic equations are obtained from the
Heisenberg equation of motion for a single component real scalar quantum field
taking the mean field approximation for the non-linear interaction. The mesonic
mean field obeys the classical non-linear Klein-Gordon equation with a
modification due to the coupling to mesonic quasi-particle excitations which
are expressed in terms of the Wigner functions of the quantum fluctuations of
the meson field, namely the statistical average of the bilinear forms of the
meson creation and annihilation operators. In the long wavelength limit, the
equations of motion of the diagonal components of the Wigner functions take a
form of Vlasov equation with a particle source and sink which arises due to the
non-vanishing off-diagonal components of the Wigner function expressing
coherent pair-creation and pair-annihilation process in the presence of
non-uniform condensate. We show that in the static homogeneous system, these
kinetic equations reduce to the well-known gap equation in the Hartree
approximation, and hence they may be considered as a generalization of the
Hartree approximation method to non-equilibrium systems. As an application of
these kinetic equations, we compute the dispersion relations of the collective
mesonic excitations in the system near equilibrium.

simulation of nitrogen redistribution from a doped epi-layer during thermal
annealing of GaAs substrate was done. The calculated impurity concentration
profile agrees well with experimental data. The fitting to the experimental
profiles allowed us to derive the values of the parameters that describe
interstitial impurity diffusion.

probe field propagating through an f-deformed Bose-Einstein condensate of
three-level atoms beyond the rotating wave approximation. For this purpose, we
use an f- deformed generalization of an effective two-level quantum model of
the three-level configuration without the rotating wave approximation in which
the Gardiners phonon operators for Bose-Einstein condensate are deformed by an
operator- valued function,f(n), of the particle- number operator n .
Corrections produced by the counter- rotating terms appear in the first order
as an intensity- dependent detuning and in the second order as an intensity-
dependent atom-field coupling. We consider the collisions between the atoms as
a special kind of f- deformation where the collision rate k is regarded as the
deformation parameter. We demonstrate the enhanced effect of subluminal and
superluminal propagation based on electromagnetically induced transparency and
electromagnetically induced absorption, respectively. In particular, we find
that (i) the absorptive and dispersive properties of the deformed condensate
can be controlled effectively in the absence of the rotating wave approximation
by changing the deformation parameter k, the total number of atoms N and the
counter- rotating terms parameter, (ii) by increasing the values of k, 1/N and
the counter- rotating terms parameter, the group velocity of the probe pulse
changes, from subluminal to superluminal and (iii) beyond the rotating wave
approximation, the subluminal and superluminal behaviors of the probe field are
enhanced.

A simplified model of jet power from active galactic nuclei is proposed
in which the relationship between jet power and disk luminosity is discussed by
combining disk accretion with two mechanisms of extracting energy magnetically
from a black hole accretion disk, i.e., the Blandford-Payne (BP) and the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) processes.
  Methods. By including the BP process into the conservation laws of mass,
angular momentum and energy, we derive the expressions of the BP power and disk
luminosity, and the jet power is regarded as the sum of the BZ and BP powers.
  Results. We find that the disk radiation flux and luminosity decrease because
a fraction of the accretion energy is channelled into the outflow/jet in the BP
process. It is found that the dominant cooling mode of the accretion disk is
determined mainly by how the poloidal magnetic field decreases with the
cylindrical radius of the jet. By using the parameter space we found, which
consists of the black hole spin and the self-similar index of the configuration
of the poloidal magnetic field frozen in the disk, we were able to compare the
relative importance of the following quantities related to the jet production:
(1) the BP power versus the disk luminosity, (2) the BP power versus the BZ
power, and (3) the jet power versus the disk luminosity. In addition, we fit
the jet power and broad-line region luminosity of 11 flat-spectrum radio
quasars (FSRQs) and 17 steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) based on our model.

the appropriate notion of a homotopy equivalence of operadic algebras and show

the bright network grains observed in the Ca II H & K lines are heated by an as
yet unidentified quasi-steady process. We propose that the heating is caused by
dissipation of short-period magnetoacoustic waves in magnetic flux tubes
(periods less than 100 s). Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of such waves are
presented. We consider wave generation in the network due to two separate
processes: (a) by transverse motions at the base of the flux tube; and (b) by
the absorption of acoustic waves generated in the ambient medium. We find that
the former mechanism leads to an efficient heating of the chromosphere by slow
magnetoacoustic waves propagating along magnetic field lines. This heating is
produced by shock waves with a horizontal size of a few hundred kilometers. In
contrast, acoustic waves excited in the ambient medium are converted into
transverse fast modes that travel rapidly through the flux tube and do not form
shocks, unless the acoustic sources are located within 100 km from the tube
axis. We conclude that the magnetic network may be heated by magnetoacoustic
waves that are generated in or near the flux tubes.

the thermodynamics and dynamics of supercooled liquids on a local scale in
terms of the properties of the potential energy landscape (PEL). The first
ingredient is the Gaussian distribution of inherent structures, the second a
specific relation between energy and mobility. This model is compatible with
general considerations as well as with several computer simulations on atomic
computer glass-formers. Important observables such as diffusion constants,
structural relaxation times and kinetic as well as thermodynamic fragilities
can be calculated analytically. In this way it becomes possible to identify a
relevant PEL parameter determining the kinetic fragility. Several experimental
observations can be reproduced. The remaining discrepancies to the experiment
can be qualitatively traced back to the difference between small and large
systems.
