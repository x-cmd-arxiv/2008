when put under external non-hydrostatic stress. Since the chemical potential on
a stressed surface is larger inside an indentation, small shape fluctuations
develop because material preferentially diffuses out of indentations. When the
bulk of the material is purely elastic one expects this instability to run into
a finite-time cusp singularity. It is shown here that this singularity is cured
by plastic effects in the material, turning the singular solution to a regular
crack.

support non-zero Floer homology groups. If (M,g) --> (M',g') is a taut surface
decomposition, then a natural map projects P(M',g') onto a face of P(M,g);
moreover, if H_2(M) = 0, then every face of P(M,g) can be obtained in this way
for some surface decomposition. We show that if (M,g) is reduced, horizontally
prime, and H_2(M) = 0, then P(M,g) is maximal dimensional in H^2(M,\partial M;
R). This implies that if rk(SFH(M,g)) < 2^{k+1} then (M,g) has depth at most
2k. Moreover, SFH acts as a complexity for balanced sutured manifolds. In
particular, the rank of the top term of knot Floer homology bounds the
topological complexity of the knot complement, in addition to simply detecting
fibred knots.

general conclusions, we present the statistical behavior by analyzing data
recorded on a large number of individual quantum dots. Exciton charge is
controlled with extremely high fidelity through an n-type field effect
structure, providing access to the neutral exciton (X0), the biexciton (2X0)
and the positively (X1+) and negatively (X1-) charged excitons. We find
significant differences in the recombination lifetime of each exciton such
that, on average, Tau(X1-) / Tau(X0) = 1.25, Tau(X1+) / Tau(X0) = 1.58 and
Tau(2X0) / Tau(X0) = 0.65. We attribute the change in lifetime to significant
changes in the single particle hole wave function on charging the dot, an
effect more pronounced on charging X0 with a single hole than with a single
electron. We verify this interpretation by recasting the experimental data on
exciton energies in terms of Coulomb energies. We show directly that the
electron-hole Coulomb energy is charge dependent, reducing in value by 5-10% in
the presence of an additional electron, and that the electron-electron and

QB's provide a simple description of oscillons (very long-living spatially
localized time dependent solutions). The small amplitude limit of QB's is
worked out in a large class of scalar theories with a general self-interaction
potential, in $D$ spatial dimensions. It is shown that the problem of small
amplitude QB's is reduced to a universal elliptic partial differential
equation. It is also found that there is the critical dimension, $D_{crit}=4$,
above which no small amplitude QB's exist. The QB's obtained this way are shown
to provide very good initial data for oscillons. Thus these QB's provide the
solution of the complicated, nonlinear time dependent problem of small
amplitude oscillons in scalar theories.

in facilitating this transport and leading to an enhancement of primary

topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal

Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimension
can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental TRI insulator in 4+1

field theory, and the $Z_2$ topological classification for the TRI insulators

physically measurable topological response functions of the TRI insulators are
completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective
topological field theory predicts a number of novel and measurable phenomena,
the most striking of which is the topological magneto-electric effect, where an
electric field generates a magnetic field in the same direction, with an
universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine
structure constant $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$. Finally, we present a general
classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions, and

gates, together with variants of the phase, \pi /8, and controlled-phase gates.
The universality of G_{u} is established by showing that it can construct the
universal set consisting of Hadamard, phase, \pi /8, and controlled-NOT gates.
Sweep parameter values are provided which simulations indicate will produce the
different gates in G_{u}, and for which the gate error probability P_{e}
satisfies: (i) P_{e} < 10^{-4} for the one-qubit gates; and (ii) P_{e} < 1.27x
10^{-3} for the modified controlled-phase gate. The sweeps in this class are
non-composite and generate controllable quantum interference effects that allow
the gates in G_{u} to operate non-adiabatically while maintaining high
fidelity. These interference effects have been observed using NMR, and it has
previously been shown how these rapid passage sweeps can be applied to atomic
systems using electric fields. Here we show how these sweeps can be applied to
both superconducting charge and flux qubit systems. The simulations suggest
that the universal set of gates G_{u} produced by these rapid passage sweeps
shows promise as possible elements of a fault-tolerant scheme for quantum
computing.

possibility of experimentally exploring the phase transformation from hadronic
to partonic degrees of freedom which is predicted to occur at several times
normal nuclear density and/or for temperatures in excess of $\sim 170$ MeV.
Such a state, often referred to as a quark-gluon plasma, is thought to have
been the dominant form of matter in the universe in the first few microseconds
after the Big Bang. Data from the first five years of heavy ion collisions of
Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) clearly
demonstrate that these very high temperatures and densities have been achieved.
While there are strong suggestions of the role of quark degrees of freedom in
determining the final-state distributions of the produced matter, there is also
compelling evidence that the matter does {\em not} behave as a quasi-ideal
state of free quarks and gluons. Rather, its behavior is that of a dense fluid
with very low kinematic viscosity exhibiting strong hydrodynamic flow and
nearly complete absorption of high momentum probes. The current status of the
RHIC experimental studies is presented, with a special emphasis on the fluid
properties of the created matter, which may in fact be the most perfect fluid
ever studied in the laboratory.

therefore it could serve as a candidate for the dark energy. It also provides a
mechanism in stabilizing the volume moduli of extra dimensions. However, the

drives the accelerating expansion of the universe. The cosmological dynamics

derive an explicit expression for packet delay distribution, from which
necessary conditions for finite mean delay and delay jitter are established. It
is found that under some circumstances, mean delay and delay jitter may
approach infinity even when the traffic load is way below the saturation
throughput. Saturation throughput is therefore not a sound measure of WLAN
capacity when the underlying applications are delay sensitive. To bridge the
gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and
safe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network
capacity users can enjoy when they require bounded mean delay and delay jitter,
respectively. The analytical model in this paper is general enough to cover
both single-packet reception (SPR) and multi-packet reception (MPR) WLANs, as
well as carrier-sensing and non-carrier-sensing networks. We show that the SBMD
and SBDJ throughputs scale super-linearly with the MPR capability of a network.
Together with our earlier work that proves super-linear throughput scaling
under saturation condition, our results here complete the demonstration of MPR
as a powerful capacity-enhancement technique for both delay-sensitive and
delay-tolerant applications.

solar value of the mixing-length parameter assumed. A precise and independent
determination of the value of the mixing-length parameter needed to model 70
Oph A requires accurate measurement of the mean small separation, which is not

stellar envelope with a polytrope-like density profile has been studied
analytically and numerically at early times while the fluid temperature is
relativistic--that is, just before and just after the shock breaks out of the
star. Such a flow should expand and accelerate as its internal energy is
converted to bulk kinetic energy; at late enough times, the assumption of
relativistic temperatures becomes invalid. Here we present a new self-similar
solution for the post-breakout flow when the accelerating fluid has bulk
kinetic Lorentz factors much larger than unity but is cooling through $p/n$ of
order unity to subrelativistic temperatures. This solution gives a relation
between a fluid element's terminal Lorentz factor and that element's Lorentz
factor just after it is shocked. Our numerical integrations agree well with the
solution. While our solution assumes a planar flow, we show that corrections
due to spherical geometry are important only for extremely fast ejecta
originating in a region very close to the stellar surface. This region grows if
the shock becomes relativistic deeper in the star.

is larger and the characteristic wavevector is shifted to coincide with the

is within 15% of that for rotons in superfluid He-4. The dispersion relation
intersects the longitudinal acoustic phonon half way to the zone boundary, and

  We confirm and further scrutinize the striking site selectiveness of energy
localisation in the presence of spatial disorder. In particular, we find that,
as a sheer consequence of disorder, a non-zero energy gap for exciting a DB at
a given site either exists or not. Remarkably, in the former case, the gaps
arise as result of the impossibility of exciting small-amplitude modes in the
first place. On the contrary, in the latter case, a small subset of linear edge
modes act as accumulation points, whereby DBs can be continued to arbitrary
small energies, while unavoidably approaching one of such normal modes. In
particular, the case of the edge mode seems peculiar, its dispersion relation
being simple and little system-dependent.
  Concerning the structure-dynamics relationship, we find that the regions of
protein structures where DBs form easily (zero or small gaps) are unfailingly
the most highly connected ones, also characterized by weak local clustering.
Remarkably, a systematic analysis on a large database of enzyme structures
reveals that amino-acid residues involved in enzymatic activity tend to be
located in such regions. This finding reinforces the idea that localised modes
of nonlinear origin may play an important biological role, e.g. by providing a
ready channel for energy storage and/or contributing to lower energy barriers
of chemical reactions.

in systems of orthogonal Dp-D(8-p) branes. The interaction between the branes
can be understood either from the closed string or open string picture. In the
closed string picture it has been noted that the DBI action fails to capture an
extra RR exchange between the branes. We demonstrate how this problem persists
upon lifting to M-theory. These D-brane systems are analysed in the closed
string picture by using gauge-fixed boundary states in a non-standard lightcone
gauge, in which RR exchange can be analysed precisely. The missing piece in the
DBI action also manifests itself in the open string picture as a mismatch
between the Coleman-Weinberg potential obtained from the effective field theory
and the corresponding open string calculation. We show that this difference can
be reconciled by taking into account the superghosts in the (0+1)effective
theory of the chiral fermion, that arises from gauge fixing the spontaneously
broken world-line local supersymmetries.

from helioseismic observations requires rotational frequency splittings of
exceptional quality as well as reliable inversion techniques. We present here
inferences based on mode parameters calculated from 2088-days long MDI, GONG
and GOLF time series that were fitted to estimate very low frequency rotational
splittings (nu < 1.7 mHz). These low frequency modes provide data of
exceptional quality, since the width of the mode peaks is much smaller than the
rotational splitting and hence it is much easier to separate the rotational
splittings from the effects caused by the finite lifetime and the stochastic
excitation of the modes. We also have implemented a new inversion methodology
that allows us to infer the rotation rate of the radiative interior from mode
sets that span l=1 to 25. Our results are compatible with the sun rotating like
a rigid solid in most of the radiative zone and slowing down in the core (R_sun
< 0.2). A resolution analysis of the inversion was carried out for the solar
rotation inverse problem. This analysis effectively establishes a direct
relationship between the mode set included in the inversion and the sensitivity
and information content of the resulting inferences. We show that such an
approach allows us to determine the effect of adding low frequency and low
degree p-modes, high frequency and low degree p-modes, as well as some g-modes
on the derived rotation rate in the solar radiative zone, and in particular the
solar core. We conclude that the level of uncertainties that is needed to infer
the dynamical conditions in the core when only p-modes are included is unlikely
to be reached in the near future, and hence sustained efforts are needed
towards the detection and characterization of g-modes.

It is demonstrated that for specific pairs of orbitals the commonly anticipated

is almost canceled by an implicit m*-scaling due to other parameters in the
Skyrme EDF. This holds in particular for an indirect m*-scaling of the two-body

single particle energies. It is argued that this unphysical property of the
Skyrme EDF is a mere consequence of the strategies and datasets used to fit

reinstates the conventional m*-scaling and improves the performance of the

and co-temporal providing evidence of multi-thermal plasma. The H${\alpha}$ and
Mk4 images show cusp-shaped structures close to the location where the downflow
started. Mk4 observations reveal that the speed of the downflow in the early
phase was substantially higher than the free-fall speed, implying a strong
downward acceleration near the height at which the downflow started.
  Conclusions: The origin of the downflow was likely to have been magnetic
reconnection taking place inside the erupting flux rope that led to its
bifurcation.

waves, and many paradoxes can be easily understood or avoided. In particular,
the postulates allow to explain the measurement problem and the concept of
interaction-free measurements; the latter allows to find objects without
``touching'' them, and sometimes the phrase ``seeing in the dark'' is used.
Additionally, the concepts of complementarity, uncertainty, decoherence,
