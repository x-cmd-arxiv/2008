necessary tools for building GUT models in F-theory. This approach is quite
flexible because the local geometrical properties of singularities in F-theory
compactifications encode the physical content of the theory. In particular, we
show how geometry determines the gauge group, matter content and Yukawa
couplings of a given model. It turns out that these features are beautifully
captured by a four-dimensional topologically twisted N=4 theory which has been
coupled to a surface defect theory on which chiral matter can propagate. From
the vantagepoint of the four-dimensional topological theory, these defects are
surface operators. Specific intersection points of these defects lead to Yukawa
couplings. We also find that the unfolding of the singularity in the F-theory
geometry precisely matches to properties of the topological theory with a
defect.

commuting phase, to completely positive maps on II$_1$ factors, associated to a
pair of isomorphic subfactors, and an intertwining unitary. This representation
is obtained through a quantized representation of the Hecke operators. in this
representation, the Hecke operators act on the Berezin's quantization,
deformation algebra of the fundamental domain of $\PSL(2,\Z)$ in the upper
halfplane. The Hecke operators are inheriting from the ambient, non-commutative
algebra on which they act, a rich structure of matrix inequalities. Using this
construction we obtain that, for every prime $p$, the essential spectrum of the
classical Hecke operator $T_p$ is contained in the interval $[-2\sqrt p, 2\sqrt
p]$, predicted by the Ramanujan Petersson conjectures. In particular, given an
open interval containing $[-2\sqrt p, 2\sqrt p]$, there are at most a finite
number of possible exceptional eigenvalues lying outside this interval. The
main tool for obtaining this representation of the Hecke operators (unitarely
equivalent to the classical representation, up to commuting phase) is a Schurr
type, positive ""square root"" of the state on $\PGL(2,\Q)$, measuring the
displacement of fundamental domain by translations in $\PGL(2,\Q)$. The ""square
root"" is obtained from the matrix coefficients of the discrete series
representations of $\PSL(2,\R)$ restricted to $\PGL(2, \Q)$. The methods in
this paper may also be applied to any finite index, modular subgroup
$\Gamma_0(p^n)$, $n\geq 1$, of $\PSL(2,\Z)$. In this case the essential norm of
the Hecke operator is equal to the norm of the corresponding convolution
operator on the cosets Hilbert space $\ell^2((\Gamma_0(p^n))\backslash
\PSL(2,\Z[1/p])$.

carries a natural closed 2-form. Asking that this be symplectic gives a
curvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in
the case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we
use this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are
never Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with
c_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from
Riemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying
six-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames
the Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to
exploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain
curvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with
fixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also
satisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of
Chen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic
four-space H^4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic
manifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in
C^4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold
transition, with isometries of H^4 acting symplectomorphically on the
resolution and isometries of H^3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.

effective area of 12.8 deg^2. Exploiting the K-band excess of all quasars with
respect to foreground stars, including quasars experiencing dust reddening and
objects with non-standard SEDs, a list of targets suitable for spectroscopic
follow-up observations with the AAOmega multi-object spectrograph is
constructed, resulting in more than 200 confirmed AGN. KX-selection
successfully identifies as quasar candidates objects that are excluded from the
SDSS quasar selection algorithm due to their colours being consistent with the
stellar locus in optical colour space (with the space density of the excluded
objects agreeing well with results from existing completeness analyses). Nearly
half of the KX-selected quasars with K<17.0 at z<3 are too faint in the i-band
to have been targeted by the SDSS quasar selection algorithm, revealing a large
population of quasars with red i-K colours. The majority of these objects have
significant amounts of host galaxy light contributing to their K-band
magnitudes, consistent with previous predictions. The remaining objects are
morphologically stellar and have colours consistent with quasars experiencing
SMC-type reddening with 0.10<E(B-V)<0.25. The i-K colour distribution indicates
that <10 per cent of the quasar population is missing from this K-band selected
sample due to dust reddening, and comparisons with simulations strongly favour
an obscured fraction of <20 per cent. (Abridged)

when a traveller at a bus stop and not knowing the time of the next bus is best
advised to wait or to start walking toward the destination. A detailed analysis
and solution is provided for a very general class of probability distributions
of bus arrival time, and the solution characterised in terms of a function
analogous to the hazard rate in reliability theory. The note also considers the
question of intermediate stops. It is found that the optimal strategy is not
always the laziest, even when headways are not excessively long. For the common
special case where one knows the (uniform) headway but not the exact timetable,
it is shown that one should wait if the headway is less than the walking time
(less bus travel time), and walk if the headway is more than twice this much.
In between it may be better to wait or to walk, depending on one's confidence
in being able to catch up to a passing bus.

of the elements have solar composition with respect to hydrogen except C which
is overabundant by 0.28 dex and Fe which is depleted by $\sim 0.2$ dex.
Contrary to most previous work, we find that the star is not H-poor and has a
normal He composition. These abundances are compared with those found in the
diffuse X-ray plasma and the nebular gas. Compared to the plasma emitting in
diffuse X-rays, the stellar wind is much less depleted in iron. Since the iron
depletions in the nebular gas and X-ray plasma are similar, we conclude that
the plasma emitting diffuse X-rays is derived from the nebular gas rather than
the stellar wind. Excellent agreement is obtained between the abundances in the
stellar wind and the nebular recombination line abundances for He, C, and O
relative to H. On the other hand, the derived stellar N abundance is smaller
than the nebular N abundance derived from recombination lines and agrees with
the abundance found from collisionally-excited lines. The mean temperature
variation determined by five different methods indicates that the difference in
the nebular abundances between the recombination lines and collisionally
excited lines can be explained as due to the temperature variations in a
chemically homogeneous medium.

galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Two SZ observables, the
central or maximum and integrated Comptonization parameters y_max and Y, relate
in a simple way to the total cluster mass, which allow the construction of mass
functions (MFs) that can be used to estimate cosmological parameters such as
Omega_M, sigma_8, and the dark energy parameter w. However, clusters form from
the mergers of smaller structures, events that can disrupt the equilibrium of
intracluster gas upon which SZ-M relations rely. From a set of
N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers, we calculate the
evolution of Y and y_max over the course of merger events and find that both
parameters are transiently ""boosted,"" primarily during the first core passage.
We then use a semi-analytic technique developed by Randall et al. (2002) to
estimate the effect of merger boosts on the distribution functions YF and yF of
Y and y_max, respectively, via cluster merger histories determined from
extended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. We find that boosts do not induce
an overall systematic effect on YFs, and the values of Omega_M, sigma_8, and w
were returned to within 2% of values expected from the nonboosted YFs. The
boosted yFs are significantly biased, however, causing Omega_M to be
underestimated by 15-45%, sigma_8 to be overestimated by 10-25%, and w to be
pushed to more negative values by 25-45%. We confirm that the integrated SZ
effect, Y, is far more robust to mergers than y_max, as previously reported by
Motl et al. (2005) and similarly found for the X-ray equivalent Y_X, and we
conclude that Y is the superior choice for constraining cosmological

boost the impact of nebular emission on the overall spectrum of galaxies. Even
so, the broadband fluxes and colours of high-redshift galaxies are routinely
analyzed under the assumption that the light observed originates directly from
stars. Here, we assess the impact of nebular emission on broadband fluxes in
Johnson/Cousins BVRIJHK, Sloan Digital Sky Survey griz and Spitzer IRAC/MIPS
filters as a function of observed redshift (up to z=15) for galaxies with
different star formation histories. We find that nebular emission may account
for a non-negligible fraction of the light received from high-redshift
galaxies. The ages and masses inferred for such objects through the use of
spectral evolutionary models that omit the nebular contribution are therefore
likely to contain systematic errors. We argue that a careful treatment of the
nebular component will be essential for the interpretation of the rest-frame
ultraviolet-to-infrared properties of the first galaxies formed, like the ones
expected to be detected with the James Webb Space Telescope.

of objects selected by the so-called ``absorption index'' (AI) is clearly
bimodal in log(AI), with only one mode corresponding to definite BALQSOs. The
surprisingly high BALQSO fractions that have recently been inferred from
AI-based samples are therefore likely to be overestimated. We then present two
new approaches to the classification problem that are designed to be more
robust than the AI, but also more complete than the traditional ``balnicity
index'' (BI). Both approaches yield observed BALQSO fractions around 13.5 per
cent, while a conservative third approach suggests an upper limit of 18.3 per
cent. Finally, we discuss the selection biases that affect our observed BALQSO
fraction. After correcting for these biases, we arrive at our final estimate of
the intrinsic BALQSO fraction. This is f_BALQSO = 0.17 +/- 0.01 (stat) +/- 0.03

the bimodality of the log(AI) distribution may be evidence that the BAL-forming

designed to solve the 3D, time dependent, radiative transfer (RT) equations for
arbitrary density fields. The SPH nature of SPHRAY makes the incorporation of
separate hydrodynamics and gravity solvers very natural. SPHRAY relies on a
Monte Carlo (MC) ray tracing scheme that does not interpolate the SPH particles
onto a grid but instead integrates directly through the SPH kernels. Given
initial conditions and a description of the sources of ionizing radiation, the
code will calculate the non-equilibrium ionization state (HI, HII, HeI, HeII,
HeIII, e) and temperature (internal energy/entropy) of each SPH particle. The
sources of radiation can include point like objects, diffuse recombination
radiation, and a background field from outside the computational volume. The MC
ray tracing implementation allows for the quick introduction of new physics and
is parallelization friendly. A quick Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) test
taken from computer graphics applications allows for the acceleration of the
raytracing component. We present the algorithms used in SPHRAY and verify the
code by performing all the test problems detailed in the recent Radiative
Transfer Comparison Project of Iliev et. al. The Fortran 90 source code for
SPHRAY and example SPH density fields are made available on a companion website

was obtained with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on the Hobby-Eberly

unusually high lithium abundance (log eps (Li)=+2.1), mild carbon ([C/Fe]=+0.7)
and sodium ([Na/Fe]=+0.6) enhancement, as well as enhancement of both s-process
([Ba/Fe]=+0.8) and r-process ([Eu/Fe]=+0.5) material. The high Li abundance can
be explained by self-enrichment through extra mixing that connects the
convective envelope with the outer regions of the H-burning shell. If so, HKII
17435-00532 is the most metal-poor star in which this short-lived phase of Li
enrichment has been observed. The Na and n-capture enrichment can be explained
by mass transfer from a companion that passed through the thermally-pulsing AGB
phase of evolution with only a small initial enrichment of r-process material
present in the birth cloud. Despite the current non-detection of radial
velocity variations (over ~180 days), it is possible that HKII 17435-00532 is
in a long-period or highly-inclined binary system, similar to other stars with
similar n-capture enrichment patterns.

simulated using a multitude of particles or particle density distributions,
which interacts and due to statistical laws and an even more fundamental
approach than the Navier-Stokes equation, the averaged flow variables can be
derived. After a short summary of the most popular particle methods the new
DMPC (Dissipative Multiple Particles Collision) approach will be presented. The
DMPC-model eliminates some of the weak points of the established particle
methods and shows high potential for more accurate CFD solution especially in
areas where standard CFD tools still have problems (e.g. aero-acoustics). The
DMPC-model deals with discrete circular particles and calculates the detailed
collision process (micro scale) of several overlapping particles. With
thermodynamic, statistical and similarity laws global (large scale) flow
variables can be derived. The model is so far 2d and the particles can move in
every direction in the 2d plane depending on the forces acting on it. The
possible overlap between neighbouring particles and multi-particle interactions
are important features of this model. A freeware software is developed and

utilizing Smoluchowski's coagulation equation, which must be obeyed by any
binary merging process which conserves mass. We find that the constraints from
Smoluchowski's equation are degenerate, limiting to a thin plane in the three
dimensional parameter space. This constraint is consistent with those obtained
from fitting to N-body measures of progenitor mass functions, and provides a
better match to the evolution of the overall dark matter halo mass function,
particularly for the most massive halos. We demonstrate that the proposed
merger rate function does not permit an exact solution of Smoluchowski's
equation and, therefore, the choice of parameters must reflect a compromise
between fitting various parts of the mass function. The techniques described
herein are applicable to more general merger rate functions, which may permit a
more accurate solution of Smoluchowski's equation. The current merger rate
solutions are most probably sufficiently accurate for the vast majority of

effect of rotation in flows with moderate Rossby numbers (down to Ro~0.1) but
at Reynolds numbers large enough to observe the beginning of a turbulent
scaling at scales smaller than the energy injection scale. We use coherent
forcing at intermediate scales, leaving enough room in the spectral space for
an inverse cascade of energy to also develop. We analyze the spectral behavior
of the simulations, the shell-to-shell energy transfer, scaling laws, and
intermittency, as well as the geometry of the structures in the flow. At late
times, the direct transfer of energy at small scales is mediated by
interactions with the largest scale in the system, the energy containing eddies
with k_perp~1, where ""perp"" refers to wavevectors perpendicular the axis of
rotation. The transfer between modes with wavevector parallel to the rotation
is strongly quenched. The inverse cascade of energy at scales larger than the
energy injection scale is non-local, and energy is transferred directly from
small scales to the largest available scale. Also, as time evolves and the
energy piles up at the large scales, the intermittency of the direct cascade of
energy is preserved while corrections due to intermittency are found to be the
same (within error bars) as in homogeneous turbulence.

clusters we have detected the amplitude of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (TSZ)
effect at the 15$\sigma$ level, the highest statistical significance reported
so far. Owing to the large size of our cluster sample, we are able to detect
the corresponding CMB distortions out to large cluster-centric radii. The
region over which the TSZ signal is detected is, on average, four times larger
in radius than the X-ray emitting region, extending to $\sim 3h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc.
We show that an isothermal $\beta$ model does not fit the electron pressure at
large radii; instead, the baryon profile is consistent with the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile, expected for dark matter in the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. The X-ray temperature at the virial radius of the clusters
falls by a factor $\sim 3-4$ from the central value, depending on the cluster
concentration parameter. Our results suggest that cluster dynamics at large

parts of mass to charge, charge radius and magnetic moment of each lepton as a
consequence of the ideas of flavor symmetry laws. Therefore, these ideas
require the verification of the lepton universality from the point of view of a
constancy of the size implied from the multiplication of a weak mass of lepton
by its electric mass. Such a principle gives the possibility to define the
lepton weak masses. If this picture does not change, leptons universally
interact not only with the photon or the weak boson but also with any of the
corresponding types of gauge fields.

band can be well approximated by a thermal plasma emission model with a
temperature of T=8.2 keV. INTEGRAL was used to image the cluster emission in
the hard energy band. The cluster is only marginally detectable ~1.6sigma in
the 44-107 keV energy band; however, the raw flux in this band is consistent
with the previous results from Beppo-SAX and RXTE observatories. We can exclude
with high significance that the hard-band flux reported by Beppo-SAX and RXTE
could be produced by a single point source. The 20-80 keV flux of a possible
non-thermal component in the cluster spectrum is (6.0+-8.8)*10**-12
ergs/cm^2/s. It is unlikely that the IC scattering of CMB photons is able to
produce hard X-ray flux at these levels, unless the magnetic field strength is
as low as 0.2muG. The latter value can be considered as a lower limit on the
field strength in Coma. We also present a temperature map of the central part

solutions and parameter uncertainties is investigated using five different LD
laws. The linear LD law cannot adequately fit the HST photometry of HD 209458,
but the other four laws give very similar results to each other. In most cases
fixing the LD coefficients at theoretical values does not bias the results, but
DOES cause the error estimates to be too small. The available theoretical LD
coefficients clearly disagree with empirical values measured from the HST light
curves of HD 209458; LD must be included as fitted parameters when analysing
high-quality light curves. In most cases the results of my analysis agree with
the values found by other authors, but the uncertainties I find are up to 3
times larger. Despite this, the analyses of sets of independent light curves
for both HD 189733 and HD 209458 do not agree with each other. This discrepancy
is worst for the ratio of the radii (6.7 and 3.7 sigma), which depends
primarily on the depth of the transit. It is therefore not due to the analysis
method but is present in the light curves. These underlying systematic errors
cannot be detected from the reduced data alone. Using my results and the
stellar spectroscopic orbits, I confirm the correlation between the surface
gravities of transiting extrasolar planets and their orbital periods.

several applications in physics, but also in insurance, finance and economics.
A definition is given for a class of stochastic integrals driven by a CTRW,
that includes the Ito and Stratonovich cases. An uncoupled CTRW with zero-mean
jumps is a martingale. It is proved that, as a consequence of the martingale
transform theorem, if the CTRW is a martingale, the Ito integral is a
martingale too. It is shown how the definition of the stochastic integrals can
be used to easily compute them by Monte Carlo simulation. The relations between
a CTRW, its quadratic variation, its Stratonovich integral and its Ito integral
are highlighted by numerical calculations when the jumps in space of the CTRW
have a symmetric Levy alpha-stable distribution and its waiting times have a
one-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution. Remarkably these distributions have
fat tails and an unbounded quadratic variation. In the diffusive limit of
vanishing scale parameters, the probability density of this kind of CTRW
satisfies the space-time fractional diffusion equation (FDE) or more in general
the fractional Fokker-Planck equation, that generalize the standard diffusion
equation solved by the probability density of the Wiener process, and thus
provides a phenomenologic model of anomalous diffusion. We also provide an
analytic expression for the quadratic variation of the stochastic process
described by the FDE, and check it by Monte Carlo.

incommensurate with the main lattice wave length. After discussing the
conditions under which the model can be realized experimentally, the study of
the density vs. the chemical potential curves for a non-trapped system unveils
the existence of gapped phases at incommensurate densities interpreted as
incommensurate charge-density wave phases. Furthermore, a localization
transition is known to occur above a critical value of the potential depth V_2
in the case of free and hard-core bosons. We extend these results to soft-core
bosons for which the phase diagrams at fixed densities display new features
compared with the phase diagrams known for random box distribution disorder. In
particular, a direct transition from the superfluid phase to the Mott
insulating phase is found at finite V_2. Evidence for reentrances of the
superfluid phase upon increasing interactions is presented. We finally comment
on different ways to probe the emergent quantum phases and most importantly,
the existence of a critical value for the localization transition. The later

General relativistic effects are taken into account using the pseudo-Newtonian

state is a torus whose density maximum is at 35rs or 50rs from the gravitating
center, where rs is the Schwarzschild radius. The torus is initially threaded
by a weak azimuthal magnetic field. We found that mass accretion rate and the
mass outflow rate strongly depend on the temperature of the initial torus. The
ratio of the average Maxwell stress generated by the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) to gas pressure is alpha ~0.05 in the hot torus and alpha ~
0.01 in the cool torus. In the cool model, a constant angular momentum inner
torus is formed around 4-8rs. This inner torus deforms itself from a circle to
a crescent quasi-periodically. During this deformation, the mass accretion
rate, the magnetic energy and the Maxwell stress increase. As the magnetic
energy is released, the inner torus returns to a circular shape and starts the
next cycle.
  Power spectral density (PSD) of the time variation of the mass accretion rate
in the cool model has a low frequency peak around 10Hz when we assumed a 10

the PSD in the cool model is steeper than that in the hot model in 30-100Hz.

oscillation. Intermittent outflows are created in both models. The outflow
speed is $0.01c - 0.05c$.

acquisition at 488 nm excitation using a flexible miniprobe that could be

the solar atmosphere in the Ca II K line since the early decades of the 20th
century. The archives made by these observations have the potential of
providing far more detailed information on solar magnetism than just the
sunspot number and area records to which most studies of solar activity and
irradiance changes are restricted. We evaluate the image contents of three Ca
II K spectroheliogram time-series, specifically those obtained by the
digitization of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, and Mt Wilson photographic archives.
We describe the main problems afflicting these data and analyze their quality
by expressing the image contents through several quantities. We compare the
results obtained with those for similar present-day observations taken with the
Meudon spectroheliograph and with the Rome-PSPT. We show that historic data
suffer from stronger geometrical distortions and photometric uncertainties than
similar present-day observations. The latter uncertainties mostly originate
from the photographic calibration of the original data and from stray-light
effects. We also show that the image contents of the three analyzed series vary
in time. These variations are probably due to instrument changes and aging of
the spectrographs used, as well as changes of the observing programs. Our
results imply that the main challenge for the analysis of historic data is
their accurate photometric calibration. This problem must be solved before they
can provide reliable information about solar magnetism and activity over the
last century. Moreover, inter-calibration of results obtained from independent

one-dimensional optical lattice interacting via a narrow Feshbach resonance.
The lattice provides a structured continuum allowing for the existence of bound
dimer states both below and above the continuum bands, with pairs above the
continuum stabilized by either repulsive interactions or their center of mass
motion. Inside the band the Feshbach coupling to a closed channel bound state
leads to a Fano resonance profile for the transmission, which may be mapped out
by RF- or photodissociative spectroscopy. We generalize the scattering length
concept to the one-dimensional lattice, where a scattering length may be
defined at both the lower and the upper continuum thresholds. As a function of
the applied magnetic field the scattering length at either band edge exhibits
the usual Feshbach divergence when a bound state enters or exits the continuum.
Near the scattering length divergences the binding energy and wavefunction of
the weakly bound dimer state acquires a universal form reminiscent of those of
free-space Feshbach molecules. We give numerical examples of our analytic
results for a specific Feshbach resonance, which has been studied
experimentally.

helioseismology, accurate forward modeling and a robust inversion of the travel
times are required. We accomplish this using three-dimensional finite-frequency
travel-time sensitivity kernels for flows along with a 2+1 dimensional (2+1D)
optimally localized averaging (OLA) inversion scheme. Travel times are measured
by ridge filtering MDI full-disk Doppler data and the corresponding Born
sensitivity kernels are computed for these particular travel times. We also
utilize the full noise covariance properties of the travel times which allow us
to accurately estimate the errors for all inversions. The whole procedure is
thus fully consistent. Due to ridge filtering, the kernel functions separate in
the horizontal and vertical directions, motivating our choice of a 2+1D
inversion implementation. The inversion procedure also minimizes cross-talk
effects among the three flow components, and the averaging kernels resulting
from the inversion show very small amounts of cross-talk. We obtain
three-dimensional maps of vector solar flows in the quiet Sun at spatial
resolutions of 7-10 Mm using generally 24 h of data. For all of the flow maps
we provide averaging kernels and the noise estimates. We present examples to
test the inferred flows, such as a comparison with Doppler data, in which we
find a correlation of 0.9. We also present results for quiet-Sun supergranular
flows at different depths in the upper convection zone.

of the influence of scattered light we found that a moderate fraction of
intensities in the inner halo originate in adjacent regions. As we combine line
intensities of distant wavelengths, and because radial intensity gradients are
steep, we corrected for effects of differential atmospheric refraction. In
order to increase the signal-to-noise of weak emission lines we introduced a
dedicated method to bin spectra of individual spatial elements. We also
developed a general technique to subtract telluric lines - without using
separate sky exposures. By these steps we avoided introducing errors of several
thousand Kelvin to our temperature measurements in the halo. For IC3568 we

Tl$_{0.5}$Pb$_{0.5}$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_7$ crystal affected by a considerable
reduction ($\sim$55%) of its effective superconducting volume fraction but
still with a relatively sharp low-field Meissner transition, a behaviour that
may be attributed to the presence of structural inhomogeneities. By taking into
account these inhomogeneities just through the Meissner fraction, the observed
diamagnetism may still be explained, consistently above and below the
superconducting transition, in terms of the conventional Ginzburg-Landau
approach with fluctuations of Cooper pairs and vortices.

spaces equipped with a well-behaved lower semi-continuous metric function.
Spaces of global and local types in continuous logic are the motivating
examples for the study of such spaces. In particular, we develop a theory of
Cantor-Bendixson analysis of topometric spaces, which can serve as a basis for
the study of local stability (extending the \textit{ad hoc} development from
\cite{BenYaacov-Usvyatsov:CFO}), as well as of global $\aleph_0$-stability. We
conclude with a study of perturbation systems (see
\cite{BenYaacov:Perturbations}) in the formalism of topometric spaces. In
particular, we show how the abstract development applies to
$\aleph_0$-stability up to perturbation.
