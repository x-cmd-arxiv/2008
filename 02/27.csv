spin; this Stoner staircase is modified non-trivially by the Kondo interaction.
We find that the spin-transition steps move to lower values of the exchange
coupling for weak Kondo interaction, but shift back up for sufficiently strong
Kondo coupling. The problem is solved numerically by diagonalizing the system
Hamiltonian in a customized good-spin basis and analytically in the weak and
strong Kondo coupling limits. The interplay of Kondo and ferromagnetic exchange
can be probed with experimentally tunable parameters.

closely connected to the phenomenon of IntraDay Variability (IDV), space VLBI
observations are of prime importance. Here we report on VSOP observations of
two prominent IDV sources, the BL Lac objects S5 0716+714. To monitor their
short term variability, these sources were observed with VSOP at 5 GHz in
several polarisation sensitive experiments, separated in time by one day to six
days, in autumn 2000. Contemporaneous flux density measurements with the
Effelsberg 100m radio telescope were used to directly compare the single dish
IDV with changes of the VLBI images. A clear IDV behaviour in total intensity
and linear polarization was observed in 0716+714. Analysis of the VLBI data
shows that the variations are located inside the VLBI core component of
0716+714. In good agreement with the single-dish measurements, the VLBI ground
array images and the VSOP images, both show a decrease in the total flux
density of ~20 mJy and a drop of ~5 mJy in the linear polarization of the VLBI
core. No variability was found in the jet. From the variability timescales we
estimate a source size of a few micro-arcseconds and brightness temperatures
exceeding 10^15 K. Independent of whether the interpretation of the IDV seen in
the VLBI core is source intrinsic or extrinsic a lower limit of T_B > 2x10^12 K
is obtained by model fitting of the VLBI-core. Our results show that future
VSOP2 observations should be accompanied by a single dish monitoring not only
to discriminate between source-extrinsic and source-intrinsic effects but to
allow also a proper calibration and interpretation of ultra-high resolution
VSOP2 images.

spontaneous fission and $\alpha$-decay processes. According to microscopic
nuclear theory, spherical shell effects at Z=114, 120, 126 and N=184 provide
the extra stability to such SHN to have long enough lifetime to be observed. To
investigate whether the so-called ""stability island"" could really exist around
the above Z, N values, the $\alpha$-decay half lives along with the spontaneous
fission and $\beta$-decay half lives of such nuclei are studied. The
$\alpha$-decay half lives of SHN with Z=102-120 are calculated in a quantum
tunneling model with DDM3Y effective nuclear interaction using $Q_\alpha$
values from three different mass formulae prescribed by Koura, Uno, Tachibana,
Yamada (KUTY), Myers, Swiatecki (MS) and Muntian, Hofmann, Patyk, Sobiczewski
(MMM). Calculation of spontaneous fission (SF) half lives for the same SHN are
carried out using a phenomenological formula and compared with SF half lives
predicted by Smolanczuk {\it et al}. Possible source of discrepancy between the
calculated $\alpha$-decay half lives of some nuclei and the experimental data
of GSI, JINR-FLNR, RIKEN are discussed. In the region of Z=106-108 with N$\sim$
160-164, the $\beta$-stable SHN $^{268}_{106}Sg_{162}$ is predicted to have
highest $\alpha$-decay half life ($T_\alpha \sim 3.2hrs$) using $Q_\alpha$
value from MMM. Interestingly, it is much greater than the recently measured
$T_\alpha$ ($\sim 22s$) of deformed doubly magic $^{270}_{108}Hs_{162}$
nucleus. A few fission-survived long-lived SHN which are either $\beta$-stable
or having large $\beta$-decay half lives are predicted to exist near
$^{294}110_{184}$, $^{293}110_{183}$, $^{296}112_{184}$ and $^{298}114_{184}$.
These nuclei might decay predominantly through $\alpha$-particle emission.

geodesic and could be related to oscillations of accretion discs. The frequency
of such ""hump""-induced oscillations can be identified with the maximal rate of
change of the orbital velocity within the ""humpy"" profile. Therefore, we
introduce an extended orbital resonance model (EXORM) of quasiperiodic
oscillations (QPOs) assuming non-linear resonant phenomena between oscillations
with the orbital epicyclic frequencies and the humpy frequency defined in a
fully general relativistic way. The EXORM is developed for both Keplerian discs
and perfect-fluid tori where the approximation of oscillations with epicyclic
frequencies is acceptable. Clearly, the EXORM could be applied to the
near-extreme Kerr black hole systems exhibiting relatively complex QPO
frequency patterns. Assuming a Keplerian disc, it can be shown that in the
framework of the EXORM, all the QPOs observed in the microquasar GRS 1915+105

occurred while Swift was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). In fact, we
show that they happen during a plentiful precipitation of high energy particles
in the SAA, producing muons in the atmosphere detected by two directional

like sharp peaks in the muon counting rate. In the same category are two

cases, inside) the field of view of the telescopes. From an additional analysis
in the behavior of the muon counting rate, it is possible to conclude that the
events are produced by precipitation of high energy charged particles in the
SAA region. Thus, due to its localization, the Tupi experiment constitutes a
new sensor of high energy particle precipitation in the SAA, and it can be
useful in the identification of some triggers of Gamma Ray Burst detectors.

(UCXBs) are hydrogen-deficient. Their helium or C/O accretion discs are
strongly X-ray irradiated. Both the chemical composition and irradiation
determine the disc stability with respect to thermal and viscous perturbations.
At shorter periods, UCXBs are persistent, whereas longer-period systems are
mostly transient. To understand this behaviour one has to derive the stability
criteria for X-ray irradiated hydrogen-poor accretion discs. We use a modified
and updated version of the Dubus et al. code describing time-dependent
irradiated accretion discs around compact objects. We obtained the relevant
stability criteria and compared the results to observed properties of UCXBs.
Although the general trend in the stability behaviour of UCXBs is consistent
with the prediction of the disc instability model, in a few cases the
inconsistency of theoretical predictions with the system observed properties is
weak enough to be attributed to observational and/or theoretical uncertainties.
Two systems might require the presence of some amount of hydrogen in the donor
star.

the dispersion relation is analyzed and exact thresholds for spectral stability
are obtained; the canonical transformation to normal form is described; an
unambiguous definition of negative energy modes is given; and thresholds

We impose initial conditions such that the deuterium is moving along the

classical spin vector of the deuterium (spin magnitude = 1) is along the

spectra for the flaring region and an outer region using the differential
emission measures (DEM) of emitting plasma based on CDS and RHESSI observations

  Results: For the flaring region, both EIT and TRACE images taken through the

However, in the outer region, the emission was primarily due to the Fe${\rm
XII}$, with substantial contributions from other lines. The average count rate
for the outer region was within 25% the observed value for EIT, while for TRACE
it was a factor of two higher. For the flare region, the predicted count rate

The high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) in neutron
star and stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries may be the result of a
resonance between the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations in strong
gravity. Aims. In this paper we investigate the resonant coupling between the
epicyclic modes in a torus in a strong gravitational field. Methods. We perform
numerical simulations of axisymmetric constant angular momentum tori in the
pseudo-Newtonian potential. The epicyclic motion is excited by adding a
constant radial velocity to the torus. Results. We verify that slender tori
perform epicyclic motions at the frequencies of free particles, but the
epicyclic frequencies decrease as the tori grow thicker. More importantly, and
in contrast to previous numerical studies, we do not find a coupling between
the radial and vertical epicyclic motions. The appearance of other modes than
the radial epicyclic motion in our simulations is rather due to small numerical
deviations from exact equilibrium in the initial state of our torus.
Conclusions. We find that there is no pressure coupling between the two
axisymmetric epicyclic modes as long as the torus is symmetric with respect to
the equatorial plane. However we also find that there are other modes in the
disc that may be more attractive for explaining the HF QPOs.

profile at the lowest absorption depths, and a sharp transition to a narrow
absorption profile at higher absorption values. The transmission spectra also
shows the presence of an additional absorber at ~6,250 Ang, observed at both

characterize a general trend of Atlas models to slightly overestimate the

sunspots, and that it has the opposite sign to the sound-speed effect. This

in sunspots just below the surface, that was found in previous time-distance

increasing the amplitude of oscillations in sunspots. For large time-distance

value which the simulations estimate to be in the interval 1.2--1.3, the
smectic phase is stabilized. This is surprisingly close to the ellipsoidal
case. In addition, we use a density-functional approach, based on the
Parsons--Lee approximation, to describe smectic and columnar ordering. In
combination with a free--volume theory for the crystalline phase, a theoretical
phase diagram is predicted. While some qualitative features, such as the
enhancement of smectic stability for increasing $\alpha$, and the probable
absence of a stable columnar phase, are correct, the precise location of
coexistence densities are quantitatively incorrect.

process: MicroRNA sequences are highly conserved among distal organisms, but on
the other hand, there is no evident conservation of their targets. Results: We
study this extensive rewiring of the microRNA regulatory network by analyzing
the evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes in D. melanogatser. We find
that in general microRNA-targeted genes tend to avoid gene duplication.
However, in cases where gene duplication is evident, we find that the gene that
displays high divergence from the ancestral gene at the sequence level is also
likely to be associated in an opposing manner with the microRNA regulatory
system - if the ancestral gene is a miRNA target then the divergent gene tends
not to be, and vice versa. Conclusions: This suggests that miRNAs not only have
a role in conferring expression robustness, as was suggested by previous works,
but are also an accessible tool in evolving expression divergence.

peaks in the X-ray Fourier power density spectra of some neutron stars reflect
a non-linear resonance between two modes of accretion disk oscillations. In
several specific models, the two modes are related to physically plausible
combinations of Keplerian, vertical and radial frequencies of geodesic orbital
motion. We investigate this concept for a specific neutron star source, a fixed
pair of modes and various neutron star equations of state. Each neutron star
model is characterized by the equation of state (EOS), rotation frequency
($\Omega$) and central energy density ($\rho_\mathrm c$). These determine the
spacetime structure governing geodesic motion and position dependent radial and
vertical epicyclic oscillations related to the stable circular geodesics. When
the parameters of neutron star model are fixed, the two considered modes imply
a frequency-frequency relation which can be compared to the observation in
order to eliminate the unsatisfactory sets (KR,$\rho_\mathrm c, \Omega$, EOS).
For the elimination we use the advanced genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm
comes out from the method of natural selection when subjects with the best
adaptation to assigned conditions have best chances to survive. The chosen
genetic algorithm with sexual reproduction contains one chromosome with
restricted lifetime, uniform crossing and genes of type 3/3/5. For encryption
of physical description (KR,$\rho_\mathrm c, \Omega$, EOS) into chromosome we

In this note we show that the only trapezoidal palindromes are Sturmian. More
generally we show that Sturmian palindromes can be characterized either in
terms of their subword complexity (the trapezoidal property) or in terms of
their palindromic complexity. We also obtain a similar characterization of rich
palindromes in terms of a relation between palindromic complexity and subword

results are: (1) The observed fraction F of strongly disturbed systems among
high mass (M>=2.5E10 Msun) galaxies is ~9% to 12% in every Gyr bin over z~0.24
to 0.80. The corresponding merger rate is a few times 10^-4 galaxies Gyr-1

ratio >=1:10 predicted by several LCDM-based simulations. (2) For M>=1E9 Msun
systems, the average star formation rate (SFR) of strongly disturbed systems is
only modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement with
recent simulations. In fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systems
only account for a small fraction (<~30%) of the total SFR density. This
suggests that the behaviour of the cosmic SFR density over the last seven

disky-pseudobulges), which defy galaxy formation paradigms requiring almost
every disk galaxy to have a classical bulge at its core. We demonstrate a proof
of concept and show early results of our ongoing three-component bulge-disk-bar
decomposition of NIR images for a sample of three complementary samples
spanning different epochs and different environments (field and cluster). In
contrast to most early studies, which only attempt two-component bulge-disk

bar. We show that it is important to include the bar component, as this can
significantly lower the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T), in many cases by
a factor of two or more, thus effectively changing the Hubble type of a galaxy

pairs, the mean gas-phase oxygen abundances of galaxies with low stellar masses
(Mstar ~< 10^9 Msun/h) exhibit an excess of 0.2 dex. Conversely, at larger
masses (Mstar >~ 10^10 Msun/h) galaxies have a systematically lower
metallicity, although with a smaller difference (-0.05 dex). Similar trends are
obtained if g-band magnitudes are used instead of stellar masses. In minor

metallicity decrement with respect to galaxies in isolation. We argue that

CAS parameters. We compare normal and distorted galaxies in terms of their
frequency, distribution within the cluster, star formation properties, and
relationship to dark matter (DM) or surface mass density, and intra-cluster

postulates a higher fraction of early type galaxies in dense environments, by
considering separately galaxies with a low bulge-to-disk (B/D) ratio and a low
gas content as these two parameters may not be correlated in clusters. We
report here on our preliminary analysis.

larger scattered disk objects tidally break-up into multiple fragments during
close planetary encounters as their orbits evolve from the trans-Neptune zone
to near Jupiter, or that there are alternative source populations that
contribute significantly to the JFCs. Well-characterized observational
investigations of the Centaurs, objects that are transitioning between the
trans-Neptune Kuiper belt region and the inner solar system, can test the
predictions of the non-steady state and the tidal break-up hypotheses. The
classical and resonant classes of the Kuiper belt are worth re-consideration as

these quantities are significantly larger in the high cool population, while
the H I column densities are indistinguishable in the two populations. We find
that heating by X-ray and FUV background radiation is insufficient to balance
the cooling rates of either population. Rather, the DLA gas is heated by local
radiation fields. The rare appearance of faint, extended objects in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field rules out in situ star formation as the dominant
star-formation mode for the high cool population, but is compatible with in
situ star formation as the dominant mode for the low cool population. Star
formation in the high cool DLAs likely arises in Lyman Break galaxies. We
investigate whether these properties of DLAs are analogous to the bimodal
properties of nearby galaxies. Using Si II equivalent width as a mass
indicator, we construct bivariate distributions of metallicity, lc, and areal
SFR versus the mass indicators. Tentative evidence is found for correlations

detailed attention to the design of specific probes spotted on the solid phase.
These problems are far from being commonplace since they refer to complex
physicochemical constraints. Whereas there are more and more publicly available
programs for microarray oligonucleotide design, most of them use the same
algorithm or criteria to design oligos, with only little variation. RESULTS: We
show that classical approaches used in oligo design software may be inefficient
under certain experimental conditions, especially when dealing with complex
target mixtures. Indeed, our biological model is a human obligate parasite, the
microsporidia Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Targets that are extracted from
biological samples are composed of a mixture of pathogen transcripts and host
cell transcripts. We propose a new approach to design oligonucleotides which
combines good specificity with a potentially high sensitivity. This approach is
original in the biological point of view as well as in the algorithmic point of
view. We also present an experimental validation of this new strategy by
comparing results obtained with standard oligos and with our composite oligos.
A specific E.cuniculi microarray will overcome the difficulty to discriminate
the parasite mRNAs from the host cell mRNAs demonstrating the power of the
microarray approach to elucidate the lifestyle of an intracellular pathogen
using mix mRNAs.

objects immersed in a diffuse background. This new method, called PowellSnakes,
speeds up traditional Bayesian techniques by: i) replacing the standard form of
the likelihood for the parameters characterizing the discrete objects by an
alternative exact form that is much quicker to evaluate; ii) using a
simultaneous multiple minimization code based on Powell's direction set
algorithm to locate rapidly the local maxima in the posterior; and iii)
deciding whether each located posterior peak corresponds to a real object by
performing a Bayesian model selection using an approximate evidence value based
on a local Gaussian approximation to the peak. The construction of this
Gaussian approximation also provides the covariance matrix of the uncertainties
in the derived parameter values for the object in question. This new approach
provides a speed up in performance by a factor of `hundreds' as compared to
existing Bayesian source extraction methods that use MCMC to explore the
parameter space, such as that presented by Hobson & McLachlan. We illustrate
the capabilities of the method by applying to some simplified toy models.
Furthermore PowellSnakes has the advantage of consistently defining the
threshold for acceptance/rejection based on priors which cannot be said of the
frequentist methods. We present here the first implementation of this technique
(Version-I). Further improvements to this implementation are currently under
investigation and will be published shortly. The application of the method to
realistic simulated Planck observations will be presented in a forthcoming

and cooling on the first generation of metal-free stars in a LCDM cosmology. We
have implemented and tested non-equilibrium HD chemistry in an adaptive mesh
refinement simulation code and applied it to two situations. (1) It is first
applied to the formation of 10^5 - 10^6 Msun halos which form in the absence of
any ionizing source. We show, in agreement with previous work, that HD cooling
is of only marginal importance for most halos; however, we find that for the
lowest mass halos, HD cooling can equal or surpass the H2 cooling rate. This
leads to a population of stars formed in halos with effective HD cooling that
are less massive by a factor of ~6 compared to halos dominated by H2 cooling.
(2) In the second part of the paper, we ionize the halos in order to explore
the impact of HD cooling in the presence of an ample population of free
electrons. This leads to cooler temperatures (due to the electron- catalyzed
production of H2) and somewhat lower resulting proto-stellar mass. Adding HD
chemistry lowers the temperature further, to the level of the CMB. We find that
HD cooling dominates over H2 cooling in the density range 10^2 cm^-3 to 10^6
cm^-3, but above this density, the temperature rises and H2 cooling dominates
again. Because of this, the accretion rate on to the protostar is almost the
same as in the H2 case (at least for accreted masses below 50-100 Msun),
therefore we argue that HD cooling in ionized halos will probably not result in
a population of significantly lower mass stars.

(growth, migration, and apoptosis) that occur during angiogenesis are tightly
regulated by signaling molecules. Thus, understanding how cells synthesize
multiple biochemical signals initiated by key external stimuli can lead to the
development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cancer. In the face of
large amounts of disjoint experimental data generated from multitudes of
laboratories using various assays, theoretical signal transduction models
provide a framework to distill this vast amount of data. Such models offer an
opportunity to formulate and test new hypotheses, and can be used to make
experimentally verifiable predictions. This study is the first to propose a
network model that highlights the cross-talk between the key receptors involved
in angiogenesis, namely growth factor, integrin, and cadherin receptors. From
available experimental data, we construct a stochastic Boolean network model of
receptor cross-talk, and systematically analyze the dynamical stability of the
network under continuous-time Boolean dynamics with a noisy production
function. We find that the signal transduction network exhibits a robust and
fast response to external signals, independent of the internal cell state. We
derive an input-output table that maps external stimuli to cell phenotypes,
which is extraordinarily stable against molecular noise with one important
exception: an oscillatory feedback loop between the key signaling molecules
RhoA and Rac1 is unstable under arbitrarily low noise, leading to erratic,
dysfunctional cell motion. Finally, we show that the network exhibits an

gravity obtained by a non-commutative deformation of General Relativity. In
this model the usual interpretation of gravity as Riemannian geometry is
replaced by a new kind of geometry, which is equivalent to a collection of
Finsler geometries with several Finsler metrics depending both on the position
and on the velocity. As a result the Riemannian geodesic flow is replaced by a
collection of Finsler flows. This naturally leads to a model in which a
particle is described by several mass parameters. If these mass parameters are
different then the equivalence principle is violated. In the non-relativistic
limit this also leads to corrections to the Newton's gravitational potential.
We find the first and second order corrections to the usual Riemannian geodesic
flow and evaluate the anomalous nongeodesic acceleration in a particular case
of static spherically symmetric background.

torus and find that it can remain unchanged for $\sim 10^{6}$ years before it
becomes non-degenerate. This transition from a degenerate torus (accretion
dominated) to a non-degenerate disk (no accretion), occurs about $10^{6}$ years
following the quark-nova, and exhibits features that are reminiscent of
observed properties of RRATs. Using this model, we can account for the duration
of both the radio bursts and the quiet phase, as well as the observed radio
flux from RRATs. The unique on and off activity of the radio pulsar PSR B1931 +
24 is similar to that of ""old RRATs"" in our model. For old RRATs, in our model,
the spin-down rate during the radio loud phase is about a factor 1.6 larger
than when it is quiet, remarkably similar to what has been measured for PSR
B1931 + 24. We discuss a connection between XDINs and RRATs and argue that some

presented, generalising and extending the approach of Wheatland & Glukhov
(1998). The probability distribution for the free energy of an active region is
described by the solution to a master equation involving deterministic energy
input and random jump transitions downwards in energy (solar flares). It is
shown how two observable distributions, the flare frequency-energy distribution
and the flare waiting-time distribution, may be derived from the steady-state
solution to the master equation, for given choices for the energy input and for
the rates of flare transitions. An efficient method of numerical solution of
the steady-state master equation is presented. Solutions appropriate for
flaring, involving a constant rate of energy input and power-law distributed
jump transition rates, are numerically investigated. The flare-like solutions
exhibit power-law flare frequency-energy distributions below a high energy
rollover, set by the largest energy the active region is likely to have. The
solutions also exhibit approximately exponential (i.e. Poisson) waiting-time

(c) It outlines a method for determining parameter values so that
physically-realistic bilayer density profiles can be obtained, for example for

potential to robustly connect some micro- and macroscale levels of multiscale
blood flow simulations. The mathematical modelling in point (a) is based upon a
consideration of the underlying physics of inter-molecular forces. The
governing equations thus obtained are minimized by gradient flows via a novel
numerical approach; this enables point (b). The numerical results are shown to
behave physically in terms of the effect of background concentration, in
contrast to the earlier model which is shown here to not display the expected
behaviour. A ""short-tail"" approximation of the lipid molecules also gives an
analytical tool which yields critical values of some parameters under certain

that all the way down to ``local-scales'' ($\sim$ parsecs) star formation is a
highly clustered process with the gas existing at a wide range of densities and
multiple phases, and seemingly decoupled from the larger-scale Galaxy. Many
different physical processes appear to be influencing the star formation rate,

support. Here we present results from global simulations of disk galaxy star

small mutation rates such a population forms a {\it quasispecies} which
consists of the fittest genotype and its closely related mutants. The
quasispecies dynamics on rugged fitness landscape follow a punctuated (or
step-like) pattern in which a population jumps from a low fitness peak to a
higher one, stays there for a considerable time before shifting the peak again

<= z < 0.03, drawn from the SDSS. Our sample includes many galaxies that are
disk-dominated and of late Hubble types. Both color cuts and Sersic cuts yield
a similar sample of ~2000 disk galaxies. We characterize bars and disks by
ellipse-fitting r-band images and applying quantitative criteria. After
excluding highly inclined (>60 degrees) systems, we find the following results.
(1) The optical r-band fraction (f_opt-r) of barred galaxies is ~48%-52%. (2)
When galaxies are separated according to normalized half light radius
(r_e/R_24), a remarkable result is seen: f_opt-r rises sharply, from ~40% in
galaxies that have small r_e/R_24 and visually appear to host prominent bulges,
to ~70% for galaxies that have large r_e/R_24 and appear disk-dominated. (3)
f_opt-r rises for galaxies with bluer colors and higher central surface
brightness. A weaker rise is seen toward lower masses. (4) We find that ~20% of
our sample of disk galaxies appear to be ``quasi-bulgeless''. (5) If we
restrict our sample to bright galaxies and only consider bars that are strong
(ellipticity >=0.4) and large enough (semi-major axis >=1.5 kpc) to be reliably
characterized via ellipse-fitting out to z~0.8, we get an optical r-band
fraction for strong bars f_opt-s of ~34%. This value is higher only by a modest
factor of 1.4, compared to the value of ~24%+-4% reported at z~0.7-1.0. If one
assumes that the increasing obscuration by dust and star formation over z~0 to
1.0 causes a further artificial loss of bars, the data even allow for a
constant or rising fraction of strong bars with redshift.

correlations (III), and the three-point coupling between the weak lensing shear
experienced by distant galaxies and the shape of foreground galaxies (GGI and
GII). We find that third-order weak lensing statistics are typically more
strongly contaminated by these physical systematics compared to second-order
shear measurements, contaminating the measured three-point signal for
moderately deep surveys with a median redshift z_m ~ 0.7 by ~ 15%. It has been
shown that accurate photometric redshifts will be crucial to correct for this
effect, once a model and the redshift dependence of the effect can be
accurately constrained. To this end we provide redshift-dependent fitting
functions to our results and propose a new tool for the observational study of
intrinsic galaxy alignments. For a shallow survey with z_m ~ 0.4 we find III to
be an order of magnitude larger than the expected cosmological GGG shear
signal. Compared to the two-point intrinsic ellipticity correlation which is
similar in amplitude to the two-point shear signal at these survey depths,
third order statistics therefore offer a promising new way to constrain models
of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Early shallow data from the next generation of
very wide weak lensing surveys will be optimal for this type of study.

to provide a comprehensive and statistically robust characterization of the
neutral inter-stellar medium properties of faint, gas rich dwarf galaxies. The
FIGGS galaxies represent the extremely low-mass end of the dwarf irregular
galaxies population, with a median M${\rm{_B\sim-13.0}}$ and median HI mass of
$\sim 3 \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$, extending the baseline in mass and luminosity
space for a comparative study of galaxy properties. The HI data is supplemented
with observations at other wavelengths. In addition, distances accurate to ~
10% are available for most of the sample galaxies. This paper gives an
introduction to FIGGS, describe the GMRT observations and presents the first
results from the HI observations. From the FIGGS data we confirm the trend of
increasing HI to optical diameter ratio with decreasing optical luminosity; the
median ratio of D$_{\rm HI}$/D$_{\rm Ho}$ for the FIGGS sample is 2.4. Further,
on comparing our data with aperture synthesis surveys of bright spirals, we
find at best marginal evidence for a decrease in average surface density with
decreasing HI mass. To a good approximation the disks of gas rich galaxies,
ranging over 3 orders of magnitude in HI mass, can be described as being drawn
from a family with constant HI surface density.

However, its existence in the real magnetic systems still remains mysterious.
Here we propose a phenomenological model to illustrate that the novel

lot of attention, particularly in the framework of ad hoc sensor networks. Most
methods proposed in the literature address the consensus averaging problem by
distributed linear iterative algorithms, with asymptotic convergence of the
consensus solution. The convergence rate of such distributed algorithms
typically depends on the network topology and the weights given to the edges
between neighboring sensors, as described by the network matrix. In this paper,
we propose to accelerate the convergence rate for given network matrices by the
use of polynomial filtering algorithms. The main idea of the proposed
methodology is to apply a polynomial filter on the network matrix that will
shape its spectrum in order to increase the convergence rate. Such an algorithm
is equivalent to periodic updates in each of the sensors by aggregating a few
of its previous estimates. We formulate the computation of the coefficients of
the optimal polynomial as a semi-definite program that can be efficiently and
globally solved for both static and dynamic network topologies. We finally
provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions in accelerating the convergence of distributed consensus averaging
problems.

heating is a small effect despite many interactions with the satellite
population with only a 20% increase in vertical velocity dispersion sigma_z and
the disk scale height z_d at the equivalent solar radius R = 2.5R_d . However,
the stellar disk is noticeably flared after 10 Gyr with z_d nearly doubling at
the disk edge. Azimuthal disk heating is much larger with sigma_R and sigma_z
both increasing by 1.7x. However, in a control experiment without satellites
dispersion increases by 1.5x suggesting that most of the effect is due to
heating through scattering off of spiral structure excited by swing-amplified
noise. Surprisingly, direct impacts of satellites on the disk can excite spiral
structure with a significant amplitude and in some cases impacts close to the
disk center also induce the bar instability. The large number of dark matter
satellite impacts expected over a galaxy's lifetime may be a significant source
of external perturbations for driving disk secular evolution.

Methods. We analyze an extensive set of spectroscopic observations which
characterize the diffuse molecular cloud observed toward HD 102065. Absorption
observations provide the extinction curve, H2, C I, CO, CH, and CH+ column
densities and excitation. These data are complemented by observations of CII,
CO and dust emission. Physical conditions are determined using the Meudon PDR
model of UV illuminated gas. Results. We find that all observational results,
except column densities of CH, CH+ and H2 in its excited (J > 2) levels, are
consistent with a cloud model implying a Galactic radiation field (G~0.4 in
Draine's unit), a density of 80 cm-3 and a temperature (60-80 K) set by the
equilibrium between heating and cooling processes. To account for excited (J
>2) H2 levels column densities, an additional component of warm (~ 250K) and
dense (nH>10^4 cm-3) gas within 0.03 pc of the star would be required. This
solution reproduces the observations only if the ortho-to-para H2 ratio at
formation is 1. In view of the extreme physical conditions and the unsupported
requirement on the ortho-to-para ratio, we conclude that H2 excitation is most
likely to be accounted for by the presence of warm molecular gas within the
diffuse cloud heated by the local dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. This
warm H2 is required to account for the CH+ column density. It could also
contribute to the CH abundance and explain the inhomogeneity of the CO
abundance indicated by the comparison of absorption and emission spectra.

for life. The various multiverse hypotheses are popular explanations for the
fine tuning. This paper reviews the four main suggestions on inference in the
presence of possible multiple universes and observer selection effects. Basic
identities from probability theory and previously unnoticed conditional
dependencies of the propositions involved are used to decide among the
alternatives. In the case of cosmic fine-tuning, information about the
observation is not independent of the hypothesis. It follows that the
observation should be used as data when comparing hypotheses. Hence, approaches
that use the observation only as background information are incorrect. It is
also shown that in some cases the self-sampling assumption by Bostrom leads to
probabilities greater than one, leaving the approach inconsistent. The ""some
universe"" (SU) approach is found wanting. Several reasons are given on why the
""this universe"" (TU) approach seems to be correct. Lastly, the converse
selection effect by White is clarified by showing formally that the converse
condition leads to SU and its absence to TU. The overall result is that,
because multiverse hypotheses do not predict the fine-tuning for this universe
any better than a single universe hypothesis, the multiverse hypotheses fail as
explanations for cosmic fine-tuning. Conversely, the fine-tuning data does not
support the multiverse hypotheses.

For a magnetic field oriented parallel to the wire axis we found that the
correlation field mainly depends on the wire cross section, while the
fluctuation amplitude is governed by the wire length. In contrast, if the
magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly, for wires longer than approximately
200 nm the correlation field is limited by the phase coherence length. Further
insight into the orientation dependence of the correlation field is gained by
measuring the conductance fluctuations at various tilt angles of the magnetic

which a central super-massive black hole generates vast radiant luminosities
through the gravitational accretion of gas. Winds launched from a rotating
accretion disk surrounding the black hole are thought to play a critical role,
allowing the disk to shed angular momentum that would otherwise inhibit
accretion. Such winds are capable of depositing large amounts of mechanical
energy in the host galaxy and its environs, profoundly affecting its formation
and evolution, and perhaps regulating the formation of large-scale cosmological
structures in the early Universe. Although there are good theoretical grounds
for believing that outflows from active galactic nuclei originate as disk
winds, observational verification has proven elusive. Here we show that
structures observed in polarized light across the broad H-alpha emission line
in the quasar PG 1700+158 originate close to the accretion disk in an electron
scattering wind. The wind has large rotational motions (~4,000 km/s), providing
direct observational evidence that outflows from active galactic nuclei are
launched from the disks. Moreover, the wind rises nearly vertically from the
disk, favouring launch mechanisms that impart an initial acceleration
perpendicular to the disk plane.

them together under the single denomination of chaotic orbits. Partially
chaotic orbits should not be confused with weakly fully chaotic orbits either,
and their spatial distributions are also different. Slow figure rotation (i.e.,
rotation in systems with zero angular momentum) seems to be always present in
highly flattened models that result from cold collapses, with the rotational
velocity diminishing or becoming negligibly small for less flattened models.
Finally, I comment on the usefulness and limitation of the classification of

in smectic elastomers and that the imposition of one necessarily leads to the
development of the other. This means, in particular, that a Smectic-A elastomer
subjected to a simple shear will develop Smectic-C-like tilt of the director.
Recently, Kramer and Finkelmann [arXiv:0708.2024, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 78}, 021704
(2008)] performed shear experiments on Smectic-A elastomers using two different
shear geometries. One of the experiments, which implements simple shear,
produces clear evidence for the development of Smectic-C-like tilt. Here, we
generalize a model for smectic elastomers introduced by Adams and Warner [Phys.
Rev. E {\bf 71}, 021708 (2005)] and use it to study the magnitude of
Smectic-C-like tilt under shear for the two geometries investigated by Kramer
and Finkelmann. Using reasonable estimates of model parameters, we estimate the
tilt angle for both geometries, and we compare our estimates to the
experimental results. The other shear geometry is problematic since it
introduces additional in-plane compressions in a sheet-like sample, thus
inducing instabilities that we discuss.

and T_i<T_e) has been calculated with molecular dynamics simulations for
temperatures between 10 and 600 eV and densities between 10^{20}/cc to
10^{24}/cc. Careful attention has been devoted to convergence of the
simulations, including the role of semiclassical potentials. We find that for
Coulomb logarithms L>1, a model by Gericke-Murillo-Schlanges (GMS) [Gericke et
al., PRE 65, 036418 (2002)] based on a T-matrix method and the approach by
Brown-Preston-Singleton [Brown et al., Phys. Rep. 410, 237 (2005)] agrees with
the simulation data to within the error bars of the simulation. For smaller
Coulomb logarithms, the GMS model is consistent with the simulation results.
Landau-Spitzer models are consistent with the simulation data for L>4.
