high-energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) gamma-ray source, due to its high X-ray and radio
fluxes. Our aim is to understand the radiative processes by investigating the
observed emission and its production mechanism using the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) experiment. Methods: We report recent
observations of the BL Lac source RGB J0152+017 made in late October and
November 2007 with the H.E.S.S. array consisting of four imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes. Contemporaneous observations were made in X-rays by the
Swift and RXTE satellites, in the optical band with the ATOM telescope, and in
the radio band with the Nancay Radio Telescope. Results: A signal of 173
gamma-ray photons corresponding to a statistical significance of 6.6 sigma was
found in the data. The energy spectrum of the source can be described by a
powerlaw with a spectral index of 2.95+/-0.36stat+/-0.20syst. The integral flux
above 300 GeV corresponds to ~2% of the flux of the Crab nebula. The source
spectral energy distribution (SED) can be described using a two-component
non-thermal synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) leptonic model, except in the
optical band, which is dominated by a thermal host galaxy component. The
parameters that are found are very close to those found in similar SSC studies
in TeV blazars. Conclusions: RGB J0152+017 is discovered as a source of VHE
gamma-rays by H.E.S.S. The location of its synchrotron peak, as derived from
the SED in Swift data, allows clearly classification it as a
high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL).

factors and rms amplitudes of both the QPOs nearly equal to the points where
the frequencies are commensurable, and where the twin QPO detections cluster.

nonlinear mesoscopic conductor using a Josephson junction as on-chip detector
is investigated theoretically. The paper addresses the regime where the noise
of the mesoscopic conductor initiates activated escape of the Josephson
detector out of the zero-voltage state, which can be observed as a voltage
rise. It is shown that the deviations from Johnson-Nyquist noise can mostly be
accounted for by an effective temperature which depends on the second noise
cumulant of the conductor. The deviations from Gaussian statistics lead to
rather weak effects and essentially only the third cumulant can be measured
exploiting the dependence of the corrections to the rate of escape from the
zero-voltage state on the direction of the bias current. These corrections
vanish as the bias current approaches the critical current. The theory is based
on a description of irreversible processes and fluctuations in terms of state
variables and conjugate forces. This approach, going back to work by Onsager
and Machlup, is extended to account for non-Gaussian noise, and it is shown
that the thermodynamically conjugate force to the electric charge plays a role
similar to the counting field introduced in more recent approaches to describe
non-Gaussian noise statistics. The theory allows to obtain asymptotically exact
results for the rate of escape in the weak noise limit for all values of the
damping strength of the Josephson detector. Also the feedback of the detector
on the noise generating conductor is fully taken into account by treating both
coupled mesoscopic devices on an equal footing.

compaction of a porous dust rim they sweep up as they move through the dusty
nebula gas. It is shown that dust aggregates formed out of micron-sized grains
stick to chondrules, forming a porous dust rim. When chondrules collide, this
dust can be compacted by means of rolling motions within the porous dust layer.
This mechanism dissipates the collisional energy, compacting the rim and
allowing chondrules to stick. The structure of the obtained chondrule-dust
agglomerates (referred to as compounds) then consists of three phases:
chondrules, porous dust, and dust that has been compacted by collisions.
Subsequently, these compounds accrete their own dust and collide with other
compounds. The evolution of the compound size distribution and the relative
importance of the phases is calculated by a Monte Carlo code. Growth ends, and
a simulation is terminated when all the dust in the compounds has been
compacted. Numerous runs are performed, reflecting the uncertainty in the
physical conditions at the chondrule formation time. It is found that compounds
can grow by 1-2 orders of magnitudes in radius, upto dm-sizes when turbulence
levels are low. However, relative velocities associated with radial drift form
a barrier for further growth. Earlier findings that the dust sweep-up by
chondrules is proportional to their sizes are confirmed. We contrast two
scenarios regarding how this dust evolved further towards the densely packed
rims seen in chondrites.

three distinct components of warm gas at negative velocities down to -20 km/s.

the emphasis on the many-body aspects of the problem, with the aim of
investigating the dependence of the critical currents on relevant variables
like the distance L between the superconducting contacts, the temperature, and
the doping level. Thus we show that, despite the vanishing density of states at
the Fermi level in undoped graphene, supercurrents may exist at zero
temperature with a natural 1/L^3 dependence at large L. When temperature
effects are taken into account, the supercurrents are further suppressed beyond
the thermal length L_T (~ v_F / k_B T, in terms of the Fermi velocity v_F of
graphene), entering a regime where the decay is given by a 1/L^5 dependence. On
the other hand, the supercurrents can be enhanced upon doping, as the Fermi
level is shifted by a chemical potential \mu from the charge neutrality point.
This introduces a new crossover length L* ~ v_F / \mu, at which the effects of
the finite charge density start being felt, marking the transition from the
short-distance 1/L^3 behavior to a softer 1/L^2 decay of the supercurrents at
large L. It turns out that the decay of the critical currents is given in
general by a power-law behavior, which can be seen as a consequence of the
perfect scaling of the Dirac theory applied to the low-energy description of
graphene.

spectropolarimetric observations of Herbig Ae/Be stars belonging to the young
open clusters NGC 6611 (< 6 Myr), NGC 2244 (~1.9 Myr), and NGC 2264 (~8 Myr),
using ESPaDOnS at theCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Results: Here we report
the discovery of strong magnetic fields in two massive pre-main sequence
cluster stars. We detected, for the first time, a magnetic field in a pre-main
sequence rapid rotator: the 10.2 Msun Herbig B1.5e star W601 (NGC 6611; v sin i

field larger than 1 kG, and imply a rotational period shorter than 1.7 days.
The spectrum of this very young object (age ~ 0.017 Myr) shows strong and
variable lines of He and Si. We also detected a magnetic field in the 12.1 Msun
B1 star OI 201 (NGC 2244; v sin i = 23.5 km/s). The Stokes V profile of this
star does not vary over 5 days, suggesting a long rotational period, a pole-on

nearby early B giant, beta Cru (B0.5 III), with the Chandra HETGS. We find that
the X-ray spectrum is quite soft, with a dominant thermal component near 3
million K, and that the emission lines are resolved but quite narrow, with
half-widths of 150 km/s. The forbidden-to-intercombination line ratios of Ne IX
and Mg XI indicate that the hot plasma is distributed in the wind, rather than
confined near the photosphere. It is difficult to understand the X-ray data in
the context of the standard wind-shock paradigm for OB stars, primarily because
of the narrow lines, but also because of the high X-ray production efficiency.
A scenario in which the bulk of the outer wind is shock heated is broadly
consistent with the data, but not very well motivated theoretically. It is
possible that magnetic channeling could explain the X-ray properties, although
no field has been detected on beta Cru. We detected periodic variability in the
hard (hnu > 1 keV) X-rays, modulated on the known optical period of 4.58 hours,
which is the period of the primary beta Cep pulsation mode for this star. We
also have detected, for the first time, an apparent companion to beta Cru at a
projected separation of 4 arcsec. This companion was likely never seen in
optical images because of the presumed very high contrast between it and beta
Cru in the optical. However, the brightness contrast in the X-ray is only 3:1,
which is consistent with the companion being an X-ray active low-mass
pre-main-sequence star. The companion's X-ray spectrum is relatively hard and
variable, as would be expected from a post T Tauri star.

Dynamical Classification","14 pages, 14 figures, to appear in ApJ",,"10.1086/589852",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many recent observational studies have concluded that planetary systems
commonly exist in multiple-star systems. At least ~20% of the known extrasolar
planetary systems are associated with one or more stellar companions. The
orbits of stellar binaries hosting planetary systems are typically wider than
100 AU and often highly inclined with respect to the planetary orbits. The
effect of secular perturbations from such an inclined binary orbit on a coupled
system of planets, however, is little understood theoretically. In this paper
we investigate various dynamical classes of double-planet systems in binaries
through numerical integrations and we provide an analytic framework based on
secular perturbation theories. Differential nodal precession of the planets is
the key property that separates two distinct dynamical classes of multiple
planets in binaries: (1) dynamically-rigid systems in which the orbital planes
of planets precess in concert as if they were embedded in a rigid disk, and (2)
weakly-coupled systems in which the mutual inclination angle between initially
coplanar planets grows to large values on secular timescales. In the latter
case, the quadrupole perturbation from the outer planet induces additional
Kozai cycles and causes the orbital eccentricity of the inner planet to
oscillate with large amplitudes. The cyclic angular momentum transfer from a
stellar companion propagating inward through planets can significantly alter
the orbital properties of the inner planet on shorter timescales. This
perturbation propagation mechanism may offer important constraints on the
presence of additional planets in known single-planet systems in binaries.

formation (based upon the aggregation of microscopic dust particles), we
describe an alternative hypothesis. We propose that planets form by
gravitational collapse at the same time as the star about which they orbit.
This 'concurrent collapse' hypothesis avoids theoretical difficulties
associated with the conventional model and suggests satisfying explanations for
various poorly understood phenomena. We introduce new explanations for FU
Orionis outbursts seen in young stars, the discovery of exoplanets with
eccentric orbits and the existence of small rocky objects such as chondrules in
the solar system.

< z < 4 and the MgII absorbers in the range 0.4<z<2.2. By correlating absorbers
with quasars on different but neighbouring lines-of-sight, we measure the
clustering of absorbers around quasars on comoving scales between 4 and 30Mpc.
The observed comoving correlation lengths are r_o~5h^-1Mpc, similar to those
observed for bright galaxies at these redshifts. Comparing with correlations
between absorbers and the quasars in whose spectra they are identified then
implies: (i) that quasars destroy absorbers to comoving distances of ~300kpc
(CIV) and ~800kpc (MgII) along their lines-of-sight; (ii) that >40% of CIV
absorbers within 3,000km/s of the QSO are not a result of large-scale
clustering but rather are directly associated with the quasar itself; (iii)
that this intrinsic absorber population extends to outflow velocities of order
12,000km/s; (iv) that this outflow component is present in both radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars; and (v) that a small high-velocity outflow component is
observed in the MgII population, but any further intrinsic absorber component
is undetectable in our clustering analysis. We also find an indication that
absorption systems within 3,000km/s are more abundant for radio-loud than for
radio-quiet quasars. This suggests either that radio-loud objects live in more
massive halos, or that their radio activity generates an additional
low-velocity outflow, or both.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Star Forming Galaxy (SFG) populations for the
first time in a deep multi-frequency VLA/MERLIN Survey of the 13^H

the faintest flux densities and account for the majority of the up-turn in the
counts, AGN still make up around one quarter of the counts at ~5 uJy (1.4 GHz).
Using radio luminosity as an unobscured star formation rate (SFR) measure we
are then able to examine the comoving SFR density of the Universe up to z=3
which agrees well with measures at other wavelengths. We find a rough
correlation of SFR with stellar mass for both the sample presented here and a
sample of local radio-selected SFGs from the 6df-NVSS survey. This work also
confirms the existence of, and provides alternative evidence for, the evolution
of distribution of star formation by galaxy mass: ``downsizing''. As both these
samples are SFR-selected, this result suggests that there is a maximum SFR for
a given galaxy that depends linearly on its stellar mass. The low
``characteristic times'' (inverse specific SFR) of the SFGs in our sample are
similar to those of the 6dF-NVSS sample, implying that most of these sources

and possibly dusty narrow line region with some contribution from synchrotron
emission associated with the jet as well as relatively minor starburst
activity. Clumpy tori models are presented which predict the mid-IR size of
this torus to be no larger than 0.05"" (0.85pc). Surrounding the nucleus is
extensive low-level mid-IR emission. Previously observed by ISO and Spitzer,
this paper presents to date the highest spatial resolution mid-IR images of
this extended near nuclear structure. Much of the emission is coincident with
Pa-alpha sources seen by HST implying emission from star forming areas, however
evidence for jet induced star formation, synchrotron emission from the jet, a
nuclear bar/ring, and an extended dusty narrow emission line region is also
discussed.

of a simulation that began with 100000 objects (stars and binaries), 5%
primordial binaries and Population II metallicity. After 16 Gyr of evolution
the model cluster has about 20% of the stars remaining and has reached
core-collapse. We compare the color-magnitude diagrams of the model at this age
for the central region and an outer region corresponding to the observed field
of NGC6397 (about 2-3 half-light radii from the cluster centre). This
demonstrates that the white dwarf population in the outer region has suffered
little modification from dynamical processes - contamination of the luminosity
function by binaries and white dwarfs with non-standard evolution histories is
minimal and should not significantly affect measurement of the cluster age. We
also show that the binary fraction of main-sequence stars observed in the
NGC6397 field can be taken as representative of the primordial binary fraction
of the cluster. For the mass function of the main-sequence stars we find that
although this has been altered significantly by dynamics over the cluster
lifetime, especially in the central and outer regions, that the position of the
observed field is close to optimal for recovering the initial mass function of
the cluster stars (below the current turn-off mass). More generally we look at
how the mass function changes with radius in a dynamically evolved stellar
cluster and suggest where the best radial position to observe the initial mass
function is for clusters of any age.

joint detection, which jointly detects the signal energy levels over multiple

is efficient in improving the dynamic spectrum utilization and reducing

as a class of optimization problems in interference limited cognitive radio

us to calculate not only radial, but also orthogonal motions, and thus to study

constrained help to improve the calibration of evolutionary models. Such
observations thereby provide more confidence in the estimation of the mass of a

planet finder instruments. The commissioning of a new coronagraph at the Very
Large Telescope (VLT) was the occasion to test the performance of this
technique on the well-known object AB Dor A and its 0.09$M_\odot$ companion AB
Dor C. The purpose of this paper is to refine the photometric analysis on this
object and to provide an accurate photometric error budget. In addition to
coronagraphy, we calibrated the residual stellar halo with a reference star. We
used standard techniques for photometric extraction. The companion AB Dor C is
easily detected at 0.185"" from the primary star, and its magnitudes in H and Ks
are in agreement with an M5.5 object, as already known from spectroscopic
observations. However, these new measurements make the earlier J-band
photometry less reliable. Finally, the comparison with evolutionary models
supports an age of (75\pm 25) Myr, contrary to previous analyses. These
observations demonstrate that coronagraphic observations can be more efficient
than direct imaging, not only to improve contrast, but also to provide a better
photometric estimation as long as a good calibration of the stellar halo is
achieved.

representing correlations between (4) macro-economic features, i.e. the so

entropy criterion points to clusters, here in a (4) variable phase space: Gross

obtained from a coupling necessarily including GDP and FCE. The results confirm
intuitive economic theory and practice expectations at least as regards
geographical connexions. The technique can of course be applied to many other
cases in the physics of socio-economy networks.

assume LTE and are based on the SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance

seen the advent of methods circumventing brute force simulation. For most
dynamical quantities, these methods all share the drawback of systematical
errors. We present a novel method for generating ensembles of phase space
trajectories. By sampling small pieces of these trajectories in different phase
space domains and piecing them together in a smart way using equilibrium
properties, we obtain physical quantities such as transition times. This method
does not have any systematic error and is very efficient; the computational
effort to calculate the first passage time across a free energy barrier does
not increase with the height of the barrier. The strength of the method is
shown in the Ising model. Accurate measurements of nucleation times span almost
ten orders of magnitude and reveal corrections to classical nucleation theory.

factorisation into tensor products, where the finest partitioning consists of
purely local unitary operations. Moreover, the common framework is kept
sufficiently general and allows for setting up gradient flows on
(sub-)manifolds, Lie (sub-)groups, quotient groups, and reductive homogeneous
spaces. Relevant convergence conditions are discussed meant to serve as
justification for recent and new achievements, and as foundation for further
research.
  Exploiting the differential geometry of quantum dynamics under different
scenarios helps to provide highly useful algorithms: (a) On an abstract level,
gradient flows may establish the exact upper bounds of pertinent quality
functions, i.e. upper bounds reachable within the underlying manifold of the
state space dynamics; (b) in a second stage referring to a concrete
experimental setting, gradient flows on the manifold of piecewise constant
control amplitudes $\R^m$ may be set up to provide (approximations to) optimal
control of quantum devices under realistic conditions.
  Illustrative examples and new applications are given relating to distance
measures of pure-state entanglement. We establish the correspondence to best

report the first systematic study of an optically-selected sample of

sensitive and enduring tracer known of tidal interactions. Eighteen of these
galaxies are (generally) classified as Seyferts, with over half (and perhaps
all) having [OIII] luminosities within two orders of magnitude of Quasi-Stellar
Objects. Only ~28% of these Seyfert galaxies are visibly disturbed in optical
DSS2 images. By contrast, ~94% of the same galaxies are disturbed in HI, in
nearly all cases not just spatially but also kinematically on galactic (>~20
kpc) scales. In at least ~67% and perhaps up to ~94% of cases, the observed HI
disturbances can be traced to tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies
detected also in HI. The majority of these neighboring galaxies have projected
separations of <~ 100 kpc and differ in radial velocities by <~100 km/s from
their respective Seyfert galaxies, and many have optical luminosities ranging

representation $\rho$ for a finite extension $\mathfrak{K}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$.
These are given by integrals over $\mathfrak{p}$-adic points of $\mathcal{G}$

that the local zeta functions are almost uniform for all $\mathfrak{K}$-split
groups whose unipotent radical satisfies a certain lifting property. This

(a) stickiness around an island of stability and (b) stickiness in chaos, along

effects in the standard map with a rather large nonlinearity K=5, and we
emphasized the role of the asymptotic curves U, S from the central orbit O and
the asymptotic curves U+U-S+S- from the simplest unstable orbit around the
island O1. We calculated the escape times (initial stickiness times) for many
initial points outside but close to the island O1. The lines that separate the
regions of the fast from the slow escape time follow the shape of the
asymptotic curves S+,S-. We explained this phenomenon by noting that lines
close to S+ on its inner side (closer to O1) approach a point of the orbit 4/9,
say P1, and then follow the oscillations of the asymptotic curve U+, and escape
after a rather long time, while the curves outside S+ after their approach to
P1 follow the shape of the asymptotic curves U- and escape fast into the
chaotic sea. All these curves return near the original arcs of U+,U- and
contribute to the overall stickiness close to U+,U-. The isodensity curves
follow the shape of the curves U+,U- and the maxima of density are along U+,U-.
For a rather long time the stickiness effects along U+,U- are very pronounced.
However after much longer times (about 1000 iterations) the overall stickiness
effects are reduced and the distribution of points in the chaotic sea outside
the islands tends to be uniform.

the magnitude and phase of the contributing K pi S wave in the range of

an isospin-two pi^+pi^+ S-wave contribution, and find that adding this to both

wonderland), also translated into esperanto, the other (Through a looking
glass) are discussed in order to observe whether natural and artificial
languages significantly differ from each other. One dimensional time series
like signals are constructed using only word frequencies (FTS) or word lengths
(LTS). The data is studied through (i) a Zipf method for sorting out
correlations in the FTS and (ii) a Grassberger-Procaccia (GP) technique based
method for finding correlations in LTS. Features are compared : different power
laws are observed with characteristic exponents for the ranking properties, and
the {\it phase space attractor dimensionality}. The Zipf exponent can take
values much less than unity ($ca.$ 0.50 or 0.30) depending on how a sentence is
defined. This non-universality is conjectured to be a measure of the author
$style$. Moreover the attractor dimension $r$ is a simple function of the so
called phase space dimension $n$, i.e., $r = n^{\lambda}$, with $\lambda =
0.79$. Such an exponent should also conjecture to be a measure of the author
$creativity$. However, even though there are quantitative differences between
the original english text and its esperanto translation, the qualitative
differences are very minutes, indicating in this case a translation relatively
well respecting, along our analysis lines, the content of the author writing.

  mass gap in QCD","19 pages, no tables, no figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The physical meaning of a mass gap introduced by Jaffe and Witten is to be
responsible for the large-scale (low-energy/momentum), i.e., the
non-perturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum. In order to make the
existence of a mass gap pefrectly clear it is defined as the difference between
the regularized full gluon self-energy and its subtracted (also regularized)
counterpart. The mass gap is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of
massless gluon modes. A self-consistent violation of SU(3) color gauge
invariance/symmetry is duscussed in order to realize a mass gap in QCD. For
this purpose, we propose not to impose the transversality condition on the full
gluon self-energy, while restoring the transversality of the full gluon
propagtor relevant for the non-perturbative QCD at the final stage. At the same
time, the Slavnov-Taylor identity for the full gluon propagator is always
preserved. All this allows one to establish the general structure of the full
gluon propagator in the presence of a mass gap. In this case, two independent
types of formal solutions for the full gluon propagator have been established.
The nonlinear iteration solution at which the gluons remain massless is
explicitly present. The existence of the solution with an effective gluon mass
is also demonstrated.

  formulation",,,"10.1002/qj.284",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data assimilation schemes are confronted with the presence of model errors
arising from the imperfect description of atmospheric dynamics. These errors
are usually modeled on the basis of simple assumptions such as bias, white
noise, first order Markov process. In the present work, a formulation of the
sequential extended Kalman filter is proposed, based on recent findings on the
universal deterministic behavior of model errors in deep contrast with previous
approaches (Nicolis, 2004). This new scheme is applied in the context of a
spatially distributed system proposed by Lorenz (1996). It is found that (i)
for short times, the estimation error is accurately approximated by an
evolution law in which the variance of the model error (assumed to be a
deterministic process) evolves according to a quadratic law, in agreement with
the theory. Moreover, the correlation with the initial condition error appears
to play a secondary role in the short time dynamics of the estimation error
covariance. (ii) The deterministic description of the model error evolution,
incorporated into the classical extended Kalman filter equations, reveals that
substantial improvements of the filter accuracy can be gained as compared with
the classical white noise assumption. The universal, short time, quadratic law
for the evolution of the model error covariance matrix seems very promising for
modeling estimation error dynamics in sequential data assimilation.

describes charge ordering in the presence of both electron-lattice interactions
and intersite electrostatic repulsion between electrons. We calculate the
optical and d.c. conductivity, and derive approximate formulas valid in the
limiting electron-lattice coupling regimes. In the weak coupling regime, we
recover the usual behavior of charge density waves, characterized by a transfer
of spectral weight due to the opening of a gap in the excitation spectrum. In
the opposite limit of very strong electron-lattice coupling, instead, the
charge ordering transition is signaled by a global enhancement of the optical
absorption, with no appreciable spectral weight transfer. Such behavior is
related to the progressive suppression of thermally activated charge defects
taking place below the critical temperature. At intermediate values of the
coupling within the polaronic regime, a complex behavior is obtained where both
mechanisms of transfer and enhancement of spectral weight coexist.

of Scl allow us to measure a velocity gradient of 7.6_{-2.2}^{+3.0} km/s
deg^{-1} along the Scl projected major axis, likely a signature of intrinsic
rotation. We also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distribution
within this system. By considering independently the kinematics of the distinct
stellar components known to be present in Scl, we are able to relieve known
degeneracies, and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are best
fitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius r_c= 0.5 kpc and mass
enclosed within the last measured point M(< 1.8 kpc)=3.4 +- 0.7 x 10^8 M_sun,
assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid. This results
in a mass-to-light ratio of 158+-33 (M/L)_sun inside 1.8 kpc. An NFW profile
with concentration c=20 and mass M(< 1.8 kpc) = 2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0} x 10^8 M_sun

poorer fits for the metal rich stars.

First, they cause <H> to depend only logarithmically on the UV-sensitive
coefficient, m_B^2, of the mass term, m_B^2 H^*H, of the bulk potential, thus
providing a new mechanism for tackling the hierarchy problem. Second, the Higgs
brane couplings cause the lowest mass KK mode to localize near the brane
without any need for geometrical effects like warping. We explore some
preliminary implications such models have for the Higgs signature at the LHC,
both in the case where the extra dimensions arise at the TeV scale, and in ADD
models having Large Extra Dimensions. Novel Higgs features include couplings to
fermions which can be different from Standard Model values, m_f/v, despite the
fermions acquiring their mass completely from the Higgs expectation value.
