fermions are constrained by the analytic structure of the S-matrix. If Regge
behavior obtains, negative signs indicate the presence of higher-spin bound
states that spoil the convergence of the dispersion integrals and drive the
corresponding operators relevant. For nucleon-nucleon scattering, the
negativity of some of the low-energy interactions signals the presence of a
spin-1 bound state: the deuteron. We connect the divergence of the dispersion
integral to the ""Sommerfeld enhancement"" of the cross-section for low-energy
scattering. We also discuss how this illuminates potential pitfalls in using
perturbative methods to understand the dependence of the low-energy nuclear
interaction on the masses of the light quarks. Finally, we suggest the
possibility of applying similar reasoning to the current-current operators in
the electroweak effective lagrangian, where no bound states spoil convergence

signatures that will be visible at the Large Hadron Collider. We analyze these

multi-leptonic states, hadronically decaying $\tau$s, tagged $b$ jets and other
hadronic jets. In all, we analyze more than 40 such lepton plus jet and missing

transverse momentum, effective mass, and invariant mass distributions of final

significant discrimination among sparticle mass patterns allowing for a
possible identification of the source of soft breaking. While the analysis
given is for supergravity models, the techniques based on mass pattern analysis
are applicable to wide class of models including string and brane models.

compete for rewards, at each time-step acting in accord with the previously
best-performing of their limited sets of strategies. Different components
and/or aspects of real-world financial markets are modelled by these games. In
the MG, agents compete for scarce resources; in the MAJG gents imitate the
group in the hope of exploiting a trend; in the $G agents attempt to
successfully predict and benefit from trends as well as changes in the
direction of a market. It has been previously shown that in the MG for a
reasonable number of preliminary time steps preceding equilibrium (Time Horizon
MG, THMG), agents' attempt to optimize their gains by active strategy selection
is ``illusory'': The calculated hypothetical gains of their individual
strategies is greater on average than agents' actual average gains.
Furthermore, if a small proportion of agents deliberately choose and act in
accord with their seemingly worst performing strategy, these outper-form all
other agents on average, and even attain mean positive gain, otherwise rare for
agents in the MG. This latter phenomenon raises the question as to how well the
optimization procedure works in the MAJG and $G. We demonstrate that the
illusion of control is absent in MAJG and $G. In other words, low-entropy (more
informative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies in
the MG but outperform them in the MAJG and $G. This provides further
clarification of the kinds of situations subject to genuine control, and those
not, in set-ups a priori defined to emphasize the importance of optimization.

constant when dealing with the SNIa data. We study further the growth of matter
perturbations and we find a scaling behaviour on large redshifts which could
provide an important constraint. In particular the growth of matter
perturbations on large redshifts in our scalar-tensor models is close to the
standard behaviour $\delta_m \propto a$, while it is substantially different
for the best-fit model in General Relativity for the same parametrization of
the background expansion. As for the growth of matter perturbations on small
redshifts, we show that in these models the parameter $\gamma'_0\equiv
\gamma'(z=0)$ can take absolute values much larger than in models inside
General Relativity. Assuming a constant $\gamma$ when $\gamma'_0$ is large
would lead to a poor fit of the growth function $f$. This provides another

two different symbolic encoding schemes, both relying on the fact that it maps

consider the standard binary partition of the torus induced by the

compatible, although not equivalent. The ergodic properties of the triangle map
are then investigated in terms of the Markov transition matrices associated to
the above schemes and furthermore compared to the spectral properties of the

L. Cardy
and the present authors concerning the bi-partite entanglement entropy between
a connected region and its complement. There the expression of the leading
order correction to saturation in the large distance regime was obtained for
integrable quantum field theories possessing diagonal scattering matrices. It
was observed to depend only on the mass spectrum of the model and not on the
specific structure of the diagonal scattering matrix. Here we extend that
result to integrable models with backscattering (i.e. with non-diagonal
scattering matrices). We use again the replica method, which connects the
entanglement entropy to partition functions on Riemann surfaces with two branch
points. Our main conclusion is that the mentioned infrared correction takes
exactly the same form for theories with and without backscattering. In order to
give further support to this result, we provide a detailed analysis in the
sine-Gordon model in the coupling regime in which no bound states (breathers)
occur. As a consequence, we obtain the leading correction to the sine-Gordon

orbital period of 2.247409 +/- 0.000010 days. We find spectral types of O3 V
for the primary and O5 V for the secondary. We made a combined solution of the
radial velocities and previously published V-band photometry to determine the
inclination for two system configurations, i = 52 degrees for the configuration
of the secondary star being more tidally distorted and i = 55 degrees for the
primary as the more tidally distorted star. We argue that the latter case is
more probable, and this solution yields masses and radii of M_1 = 47 +/- 2
M_Sun and R_1 = 11.4 +/- 0.1 R_Sun for the primary, and M_2 = 28 +/- 1 M_Sun

plotted on a theoretical HR diagram, we find the age of the system to be about
1.5 Myr.

collision energy. These logarithms are important to describe multijet final
states in deep inelastic scattering and hadron colliders, and in the study of

to evolve a set of particles in two or three dimensions using either a Leapfrog
or Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator, with or without individual timesteps for
each particle. Particles may interact gravitationally as $N$-body particles,
and all or any subset may also interact hydrodynamically, using the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method. Massive point particles (`stars') which may
accrete nearby SPH or $N$-body particles may also be included. The default free
boundary conditions can be replaced by a module to include periodic boundaries.
Cosmological expansion may also be included. An interface with special purpose
`GRAPE' hardware may also be selected. If available, forces obtained from the
GRAPE coprocessors may be transparently substituted for those obtained from the
default tree based calculation. The code may be run without modification on
single processors or in parallel using OpenMP compiler directives on large
scale, shared memory parallel machines. In comparison to the Gadget-2 code of
Springel 2005, the gravitational force calculation is $\approx 3.5 - 4.8$ times
faster with VINE when run on 8 Itanium~2 processors in an SGI Altix, while
producing nearly identical outcomes in our test problems. We present

counterpart in the motion of a unit-length statevector in an N-dimensional

two-dimensional rotations. But the desired statevector change can also be
treated as a succession of reflections, the generalization of Householder
transformations. In multidimensional Hilbert space such reflection sequences
offer more efficient procedures for statevector manipulation than do sequences
of rotations. We here show how such reflections can be designed for a system
with two degenerate levels - a generalization of the traditional two-state atom
- that allows the construction of propagators for angular momentum states. We
use the Morris-Shore transformation to express the propagator in terms of
Morris-Shore basis states and Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to
connect properties of laser pulses to Hilbert-space motion. Under suitable
conditions on the couplings and the common detuning, the propagators within
each set of degenerate states represent products of generalized Householder
reflections, with orthogonal vectors. We propose physical realizations of this
novel geometrical object with resonant, near-resonant and far-off-resonant
laser pulses. We give several examples of implementations in real atoms or

the probability of a repetition of a signal from the same direction is

architectural properties of the serial and shared memory parallel computers on

the code itself. We continue with a detailed description of a number of
optimizations made to the layout of the particle data in memory and to our
implementation of a binary tree used to access that data for use in
gravitational force calculations and searches for SPH neighbor particles. We
describe modifications to the code necessary to obtain forces efficiently from
special purpose `GRAPE' hardware. We conclude with an extensive series of
performance tests, which demonstrate that the code can be run efficiently and
without modification in serial on small workstations or in parallel using
OpenMP compiler directives on large scale, shared memory parallel machines. We
analyze the effects of the code optimizations and estimate that they improve
its overall performance by more than an order of magnitude over that obtained
by many other tree codes. Scaled parallel performance of the gravity and SPH
calculations, together the most costly components of most simulations, is
nearly linear up to maximum machine sizes available to us (120 processors on an
Origin~3000). At similar accuracy, performance of VINE, used in GRAPE-tree
mode, is approximately a factor two slower than that of VINE, used in host-only
mode. Optimizations of the GRAPE/host communications could improve the speed by
as much as a factor of three, but have not yet been implemented in VINE.

addition, there are N-1 dark states composed of ground states. We use this
decomposition to derive analytical solutions for degenerate extensions of the
most popular exactly soluble models: the resonance solution, the Rabi,
Landau-Zener, Rosen-Zener, Allen-Eberly and Demkov-Kunike models. We suggest
various applications of the multistate solutions, for example, as tools for
creating multistate coherent superpositions by generalized resonant pi-pulses.
We show that such generalized pi-pulses can occur even when the upper state is
far off resonance, at special detunings, which makes it possible to operate in
the degenerate ground-state manifold without populating the (possibly lossy)
upper state, even transiently.

sample. In this paper, we present a new method to calibrate GRB relations in a
cosmology-independent way. Since objects at the same redshift should have the
same luminosity distance and since the distance moduli of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) obtained directly from observations are completely cosmology
independent, we obtain the distance modulus of a GRB at a given redshift by
interpolating from the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia. Then we calibrate seven GRB
relations without assuming a particular cosmological model and construct a GRB
Hubble diagram to constrain cosmological parameters. From the 42 GRBs at
$1.4<z\le6.6$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.25_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.75_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and
for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state

provides important insight into the difference between pressure and chemical
doping as means of driving quantum phase transitions. Measurement of the charge
density wave over more than two orders of magnitude of diffraction intensity
provides the clearest demonstration to date of a weakly-coupled, BCS-like
ground state. Evidence for the coexistence of this weakly-coupled ground state
with high-energy excitations and pseudogap formation above the ordering
temperature in chromium, the charge-ordered perovskite manganites, and the blue
bronzes, among other such systems, raises fundamental questions about the
distinctions between weak and strong coupling.

  Ed.: Ruediger Vaas (Springer Verlag, 2008)",,,"IGPG-08/2-6","gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite its great successes in accounting for the current observations, the
so called `standard' model of cosmology faces a number of fundamental
unresolved questions. Paramount among these are those relating to the nature of
the origin of the universe and its early evolution. Regarding the question of
origin, the main difficulty has been the fact that within the classical general
relativistic framework, the `origin' is almost always a singular event at which
the laws of physics break down, thus making it impossible for such an event, or
epochs prior to it, to be studied. Recent studies have shown that Loop Quantum
Cosmology may provide a non-singular framework where these questions can be
addressed. The crucial role here is played by quantum effects, i.e.\
corrections to the classical equations of motion, which are incorporated in
effective equations employed to develop cosmological scenarios.
  In this chapter we shall consider the three main types of quantum effects
expected to be present within such a framework and discuss some of their
consequences for the effective equations. In particular we discuss how such
corrections can allow the construction of non-singular emergent scenarios for
the origin of the universe, which are past-eternal, oscillating and naturally
emerge into an inflationary phase. These scenarios provide a physically
plausible picture for the origin and early phases of the universe, which is in
principle testable. We pay special attention to the interplay between these
different types of correction terms. Given the absence, so far, of a complete
derivation of such corrections in general settings, it is important to bear in
mind the questions of consistency and robustness of scenarios based on partial
inclusion of such effects.

where many links contend for one channel using random access. In such networks,
distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) involves a process of joint channel
probing and distributed scheduling. It has been shown that under perfect
channel estimation, the optimal DOS for maximizing the network throughput is a
pure threshold policy. In this paper, this formalism is generalized to explore
DOS under noisy channel estimation, where the transmission rate needs to be
backed off from the estimated rate to reduce the outage. It is shown that the
optimal scheduling policy remains to be threshold-based, and that the rate
threshold turns out to be a function of the variance of the estimation error
and be a functional of the backoff rate function. Since the optimal backoff
rate is intractable, a suboptimal linear backoff scheme that backs off the
estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence the rate is proposed. The
corresponding optimal backoff ratio and rate threshold can be obtained via an
iterative algorithm. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the
tradeoff caused by increasing training time to improve channel estimation at

entangled after a finite time despite the fact that the coherence between the

call sudden birth of entanglement, is opposite to the currently extensively
discussed sudden death of entanglement and is characteristic for transient
dynamics of one-photon entangled states of the system. We determine the
threshold time for the creation of entanglement and find that it is related to
time at which the antisymmetric state remains the only excited state being

distance between the qubits and the direction of initial excitation relative to

were originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following the
merger of these haloes, merged to create a single Brightest Cluster Galaxy. In
addition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatter

generic prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.

proposed for MIMO-OFDMA downlink systems. Unlike the conventional beamforming
schemes in which beamforming is implemented solely by the base station (BS) in
a per-subcarrier fashion, the proposed schemes take advantages of a novel
channel decomposition technique to perform beamforming jointly by the BS and
the mobile terminal (MT). The resulting beamforming schemes allow the BS to
employ only {\em one} beamforming matrix (BFM) to form beams for {\em all}
subcarriers while each MT completes the beamforming task for each subcarrier
locally. Consequently, for a MIMO-OFDMA system with $Q$ subcarriers, the
proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes require only one BFM
index and $Q$ supportable throughputs to be returned from each MT to the BS, in
contrast to $Q$ BFM indices and $Q$ supportable throughputs required by the
conventional schemes. The advantage of the proposed schemes becomes more
evident when a further feedback reduction is achieved by grouping adjacent
subcarriers into exclusive clusters and returning only cluster information from
each MT. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed reduced-feedback schemes.

This cluster exhibits a remarkable bright 'central ring' formed by 4 bright

observational constraints that are potentially very interesting to probe the
central mass distribution. The stellar contribution from the cD galaxy (~1.25

and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described using
a generalized NFW profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope \alpha.

~5"" to ~50""), the slope of the dark matter distribution in Abell1703 is equal
to 1.09^{+0.05}_{-0.11} (3\sigma confidence level). The concentration parameter

radius, the 2D mass is equal to M(50"")=2.4 10^{14} M_{\sun}. We cannot draw any
conclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results from
realistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison.

gravity-mode research thanks to the unprecedented quality of the data
available, either from space with SoHO, or from the ground-based networks as
BiSON or GONG. From the first upper limit of the gravity-mode amplitudes fixed
at 10 mm/s at 200 microHz given by Appourchaux et al. (2000), on one hand, a
peak was supposed to be a component of the l=1, n=1 mixed mode (Garcia et al.
2001a, b; Gabriel et al. 2002) and, on the other hand, a couple of patterns
--multiplets-- were attributed to gravity modes (Turck-Chieze et al. 2004;
Mathur et al. 2007). One of these patterns, found around 220 microHz, could be
labeled as the l=2, n =-3 g mode, which is expected to be the one with the
highest surface amplitude (Cox and Guzik 2004). Finally, in 2007, Garcia et al.
were able to measure the fingertips of the dipole gravity modes looking for
their asymptotic properties. In the present paper we present an update of the
recent developments on this subject with special attention to the 220 microHz
region, the dipole asymptotic properties and the impact of the incoming g-mode
observations on the knowledge of the solar structure and rotation profile.

radio galaxies, based on new and archival XMM-Newton observations. We report
new detections of group-scale environments around three radio galaxies, 3C 296,
NGC 1044 and 3C 76.1. As with previous studies, we find that FR-I radio
galaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitude
in bolometric X-ray luminosity, but find no evidence for a tight relationship
between large-scale X-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size,
radio luminosity, and axial ratio. We confirm earlier work showing that
equipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the external
pressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particles
must be present or the lobes must be magnetically dominated. We present the
first direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missing
pressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure and
apparent pressure imbalance. Finally, our study provides further support for
the presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared to
the group population as a whole. For five of eight temperature excesses, the
energy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy required
to produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases the
current radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. It
remains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated with
the current phase of AGN activity, or whether it is instead either a signature
of previous AGN activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of group
properties most conducive to the growth of an FR-I radio galaxy.

authors for multiuser MIMO-SDMA downlink systems with linear combining. In
particular, it has been demonstrated that significant performance improvement
can be achieved by incorporating low-complexity linear combining techniques
into the design of OS schemes for MIMO-SDMA. However, this previous analysis
was performed based on the effective signal-to-interference ratio (SIR),
assuming an interference-limited scenario, which is typically a valid
assumption in SDMA-based systems. It was shown that the limiting distribution
of the effective SIR is of the Frechet type. Surprisingly, the corresponding
scaling laws were found to follow $\epsilon\log K$ with $0<\epsilon<1$, rather
than the conventional $\log\log K$ form.
  Inspired by this difference between the scaling law forms, in this paper a
systematic approach is developed to derive asymptotic throughput and scaling
laws based on signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) by utilizing extreme
value theory. The convergence of the limiting distribution of the effective
SINR to the Gumbel type is established. The resulting scaling law is found to
be governed by the conventional $\log\log K$ form. These novel results are
validated by simulation results. The comparison of SIR and SINR-based analysis
suggests that the SIR-based analysis is more computationally efficient for
SDMA-based systems and it captures the asymptotic system performance with
higher fidelity.

walls in order-disorder ferroelectrics has been studied and a general method is
proposed for the measurement of domain width in nano ferroelectrics. Based on
the fact that electric polarization undergoes spiral orientation as one moves
from one domain to the other, it is assumed that at low temperatures the spins
at and near domain walls undergo relaxation due to possible easy reorientation
of electric polarization in domain walls even though such a relaxation in the
main body of the domain has almost ceased. The spins present inside the domain
undergo relaxation through transfer of magnetization to the domain walls
through a spin diffusion process by nearest neighbour interaction. Rate
equations for spin populations are formed by representing the ferroelectric
domain by a one-dimensional chain of equidistant spins having dipolar coupling.
Spin populations are calculated as a function of time for different ratios of
quadrupolar to dipolar transition probabilities for a sample subjected to
selective rf pulse. Expression for spin- lattice relaxation time T1 is derived
in terms of domain width and ratio of quadrupolar to dipolar transition
probabilities. It is found that the domain width can be estimated provided the
value of spin lattice relaxation time T1 is known for the corresponding crystal
with normal sized grains. The results are quite general and can be applied to
any order disorder ferroelectric with nano sized domains and having spin I=3/2
nuclei.

attention recently in both the media and academic community. We focus on a
relatively under-explored topic: the use of statistical models for the analysis
of fielding based on high-resolution data consisting of on-field location of
batted balls. We combine spatial modeling with a hierarchical Bayesian
structure in order to evaluate the performance of individual fielders while
sharing information between fielders at each position. We present results
across four seasons of MLB data (2002--2005) and compare our approach to other
fielding evaluation procedures.

complexity. However, many networks also contain a large degree of structural
repetition. An immediate question then arises: can we characterize essential
network complexity while excluding structural redundancy?
  In this article we utilize inherent network symmetry to collapse all
redundant information from a network, resulting in a coarse-graining which we
show to carry the essential structural information of the `parent' network. In
the context of algebraic combinatorics, this coarse-graining is known as the
\emph{quotient}. We systematically explore the theoretical properties of
network quotients and summarize key statistics of a variety of `real-world'
quotients with respect to those of their parent networks. In particular, we
find that quotients can be substantially smaller than their parent networks yet
typically preserve various key functional properties such as complexity
(heterogeneity and hubs vertices) and communication (diameter and mean geodesic
distance), suggesting that quotients constitute the essential structural
skeleton of their parent network. We summarize with a discussion of potential
uses of quotients in analysis of biological regulatory networks and ways in
which using quotients can reduce the computational complexity of network
algorithms.

the radiation field of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around the
black hole, and can thus be used to probe the innermost regions around the
black hole. We calculate the optical depth of the ADAF radiation field to the
TeV photons and find it strongly depends on the spin of the black hole. We find
that transparent radii of 10 TeV photons are of $5R_{\rm S}$ and $13R_{\rm S}$
for the maximally rotating and non-rotating black holes, respectively. With the
observations, the calculated transparent radii strongly suggest the black hole
is spinning fast in the galaxy. TeV photons could be used as a powerful
diagnostic for estimating black hole spins in galaxies in the future.

deterioration of initial quantum resources, understood as the entanglement
initially shared by the input system with some reference purifying it. One
effective way to measure such a deterioration is by measuring the loss of
coherent information, namely the difference between the initial coherent
information and the final one: such a difference is ``small'', if and only if
the action of the channel can be ``almost perfectly'' corrected with
probability one. In this work, we generalise this result to different
entanglement loss functions, notably including the entanglement of formation
loss, and prove that many inequivalent entanglement measures lead to equivalent
conditions for approximate quantum error correction. In doing this, we show how
different measures of bipartite entanglement give rise to corresponding
distance-like functions between quantum channels, and we investigate how these
induced distances are related to the cb-norm.

attributed to the presence of localization on the length scale of the mean free
path, as a consequence of the strictly 1-dimensional nature of disorder, which
does not create mode mixing, while no localization appears in common
semiclassical models. We expect localization to be indeed present in practical
situations with prevalent 1-D disorder, and the existing experimental evidence
appears to be consistent with such a prediction.

spectra about this ground state using bond operator formalism. In particular we
obtain dispersions of all 18 triplet modes in the reduced Brillouin zone. In
the bond operator mean-field theory, it is found that a large number of triplet
modes are non-dispersive. In particular, the lowest triplet excitation is
non-dispersive and degenerate with a dispersive mode at the zone center. Away
from the zone center, the lowest triplet is separated from two other flat modes
by a small energy gap. Quantum fluctuations are considered by taking into
account scattering processes of two triplets and their bound state formation,
which leads to a downward renormalization of the lowest spin triplet gap. The
dispersion of the lowest triplet excitation in the VBS state is compared with
the dispersive lower bound of the triplet continuum expected in competing spin
liquid phases. Implications to future neutron scattering experiments are
discussed.

Excluding explicitly hard-core interaction we discuss the so called `glass

spectacular slowing down of relaxation to equilibrium, when the temperature is
changed over a relatively small interval. Using the classical example of a
50-50 binary liquid of N particles with different interaction length-scales we

bounded in N, showing that the graph of configurations has the `small world'

CJF is a VLBI survey (VLBA observations at 5 GHz) of 293 AGN with detailed
information on jet component motion. Aims: We investigate and discuss the soft
X-ray properties of this AGN sample and examine the correlations between X-ray
and VLBI properties, test beaming scenarios, and search for the discriminating
properties between the sub-samples detected and not detected by ROSAT. Methods:
Comparing the observed and the predicted X-ray fluxes by assuming an Inverse
Compton (IC) origin for the observed X-rays, we compute the beaming or Doppler
factor and contrast the Doppler factors with other beaming indicators derived
from the VLBI observations, such as the value of the expansion velocity, and
the observed and intrinsic brightness temperature. In addition, we investigate
the large-scale radio structure of the AGN and the difference between the pc-
and kpc-scale structure (misalignment) with regard to the X-ray
observations.Results: We find a nearly linear relation between X-ray and radio
luminosities, and a similar but less stringent behaviour for the relation
between optical and X-ray luminosities. The quasars detected by ROSAT have a
different $\beta_{\rm app}$-redshift relationship compared to the non-detected
ones. ROSAT-detected sources tend to reveal extended large-scale radio
structures more often. Conclusions: We conclude that beaming alone cannot
explain the observed dichotomy of ROSAT detection or non-detection and assume
that the large-scale jet structure plays a decisive role.

candidates lie very close to or below the Hydrogen-burning limit. A first
estimate of the slope of the Initial Mass Function in Cha II is consistent with
that of other T associations. The star formation efficiency in the cloud (1-4%)
is consistent with our own estimates for Taurus and Lupus, but significantly
lower than for Cha I. This might mean that different star-formation activities
in the Chamaeleon clouds may reflect a different history of star formation. We
also find that the Cha II cloud is turning some 8 solar masses into stars every
Myr, which is less than the star formation rate in the other c2d clouds.
However, the star formation rate is not steady and evidence is found that the
star formation in Cha II might have occurred very rapidly. The H_alpha emission
of the Cha II PMS objects, as well as possible correlations between their
stellar and disk properties, are also investigated.

Oscillator (DOPO) tuned to the first transverse mode family at the signal

system is broken. When quantum effects were taken into account, it was found on
the one hand, that quantum noise is able to induce a random rotation on this
classically emitted mode. On the other hand, the analysis of a balanced
homodyne detection in which the local oscillator (LO) was orthogonal to the
excited mode at any time, showed that squeezing in the quadrature selected by
the LO was found for every phase of this one, squeezing being perfect for a
pi/2 phase. This last fact revealed an apparent paradox: If all quadratures are
below shot noise level, the uncertainty principle seems to be violated. In [1]
we stated that the explanation behind this paradox is that the quadratures of
the rotating orthogonal mode do not form a canonical pair, and the extra noise
is transferred to the diffusing orientation. Thes notes are devoted to prove

formed along the boundary between the two domains, have features strongly
dependent on whether $B_0$ is parallel or antiparallel to $B_1$. In the
parallel case, when the Zeeman spin splitting can be ignored, the magnetic edge
states originating from the $n=0$ Landau levels of the two domains have
dispersionless energy levels, contrary to those from the $n \ne 0$ levels.
Here, $n$ is the graphene Landau-level index. They become dispersive as the
Zeeman splitting becomes finite or as an electrostatic step potential is
additionally applied. In the antiparallel case, the $n=0$ magnetic edge states
split into electron-like and hole-like current-carrying states. The energy gap
between the electron-like and hole-like states can be created by the Zeeman
splitting or by the step potential. These features are attributed to the fact
that the pseudo-spin of the magnetic edge states couples to the direction of

to bridge gaps between different processes which can be observed on different
scales. This is especially true in the field of chemical reactions where the
abilities to form bonds between different types of atoms and molecules create
much of the properties we experience in our everyday life, especially in all
biological activity. There are essentially two types of processes related to
biochemical reaction networks, the interactions among molecules and
interactions involving their conformational changes, so in a sense, their
internal state. The first type of processes can be conveniently approximated by
the so-called mass-action kinetics, but this is not necessarily so for the
second kind where molecular states do not define any kind of density or
concentration. In this paper we demonstrate the necessity to study reaction
networks in a stochastic formulation for which we can construct a coherent
approximation in terms of specific space-time scales and the number of
particles. The continuum limit procedure naturally creates equations of
Fokker-Planck type where the evolution of the concentration occurs on a slower
time scale when compared to the evolution of the conformational changes, for
example triggered by binding or unbinding events with other (typically smaller)
molecules. We apply the asymptotic theory to derive the effective, i.e.
macroscopic dynamics of the biochemical reaction system. The theory can also be
applied to other processes where entities can be described by finitely many
internal states, with changes of states occuring by arrival of other entities

hydrodynamic mean-field energy functional, we derive the relevant scattering
amplitude including the crossover from sound-like to particle-like excitations.
The very different scattering properties of these limiting cases are smoothly
connected by an angular envelope function with a well-defined node of vanishing

in terms of the change in the probability of finding two electrons at a given
distance $r_{12}$ (intracule density) when the electron-electron interaction is
multiplied by a real parameter $\lambda$ varying between 0 (Kohn-Sham system)
and 1 (physical system). In this process, usually called adiabatic connection,
the one-electron density is (ideally) kept fixed by a suitable local one-body
potential. While an accurate intracule density of the physical system can only
be obtained from expensive wavefunction-based calculations, being able to
construct good models starting from Kohn-Sham ingredients would highly improve
the accuracy of density functional calculations. To this purpose, we
investigate the intracule density in the $\lambda\to\infty$ limit of the
adiabatic connection. This strong-interaction limit of density functional
theory turns out to be, like the opposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit,
mathematically simple and can be entirely constructed from the knowledge of the
one-electron density. We develop here the theoretical framework and, using
accurate correlated one-electron densities, we calculate the intracule
densities in the strong interaction limit for few atoms. Comparison of our
results with the corresponding Kohn-Sham and physical quantities provides
useful hints for building approximate intracule densities along the adiabatic
connection of density functional theory.

braking (as suggested by us before for low-mass semidetached binaries) the

close to the observed masses and effective temperatures (as inferred from their
spectra) of donor stars in short-period LMBHBs. Theoretical mass-transfer rates
in SXTs are consistent with the observed ones if one assumes that accretion
discs in these systems are truncated (``leaky''). We find that the population
of short-period SXTs is formed mainly by systems which had unevolved or
slightly evolved main-sequence donors ($M_2 \lesssim 1.2M_\odot$) with a
hydrogen abundance in the center $X_c > 0.35$ at the Roche-lobe overflow
(RLOF). Longer period (0.5 - 1) day) SXTs might descend from systems with
initial donor masses of about 1 $M_\odot$ and $X_c < 0.35$. Thus, one can
explain the origin of short period LMBHB without invoking donors with cores
almost totally depleted of hydrogen. Our models suggest that, unless the
currently accepted empirical estimates of mass-loss rates by winds for massive
O-stars and Wolf-Rayet stars are significantly over-evaluated, a very high
efficiency of common-envelope ejection is necessary to form short-period
LMBHBs.

three-dimensional nested grid simulations, in which the initial ratio of
rotational to gravitational energy of the host cloud \beta_0 (=10^-1 - 10^-6)
and cloud metallicity Z (=0 - Z_\odot) are parameters. Starting from a central
number density of n = 10^4 cm^-3, cloud evolution for 48 models is calculated
until the protostar is formed (n \simeq 10^23 cm^-3) or fragmentation occurs.
The fragmentation condition depends both on the initial rotational energy and
cloud metallicity. Cloud rotation promotes fragmentation, while fragmentation
tends to be suppressed in clouds with higher metallicity. Fragmentation occurs
when \beta_0 > 10^-3 in clouds with solar metallicity, while fragmentation
occurs when \beta_0 > 10^-5 in the primordial gas cloud. Clouds with lower
metallicity have larger probability of fragmentation, which indicates that the
binary frequency is a decreasing function of cloud metallicity. Thus, the
binary frequency at the early universe (or lower metallicity environment) is
higher than at present day (or higher metallicity environment). In addition,
binary stars born from low-metallicity clouds have shorter orbital periods than
those from high-metallicity clouds. These trends are explained in terms of the
thermal history of the collapsing cloud.

curvature of the Universe is difficult due to strong degeneracies. To
circumvent this problem when analyzing data it is usual to assume flatness to
constrain DE, or conversely, to assume that DE is a cosmological constant to
constrain curvature. In this paper, we quantify the impact of such assumptions
in view of future large surveys. We simulate future data for type Ia Supernovae
(SNIa), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO) for a large range of fiducial cosmologies allowing a small spatial
curvature. We take into account a possible time evolution of DE through a
parameterized equation of state : $w(a) = w_0 + (1-a) w_a$. We then fit the
simulated data with a wrong assumption on the curvature or on the DE
parameters. For a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, if flatness is incorrectly
assumed in the fit and if the true curvature is within the ranges
$0.01<\Omega_k<0.03$ and $-0.07<\Omega_k<-0.01$, one will conclude erroneously
to the presence of an evolving DE, even with high statistics. On the other
hand, models with curvature and dynamical DE can be confused with a flat
$\Lambda$CDM model when the fit ignores a possible DE evolution. We find that,
in the future, with high statistics, such risks of confusion should be limited,
but they are still possible, and biases on the cosmological parameters might be
important. We conclude on recalling that, in the future, it will be mandatory
to perform some complete multi-probes analyses, leaving the DE parameters as
well as the curvature as free parameters.

originating ionisation sources such as X-rays or cosmic rays are unable to
penetrate. This suggests that for a wide range of radii, MHD turbulence can
only be sustained in the surface layers where the ionisation fraction is
sufficiently high. A dead zone is expected to exist near the midplane, such
that active accretion only occurs near the upper and lower disc surfaces.
Recent work, however, suggests that under suitable conditions the dead zone may
be enlivened by turbulent transport of ions from the surface layers into the
dense interior.
  In this paper we present a suite of simulations that examine where, and under
which conditions, a dead zone can be enlivened by turbulent mixing. We use
three-dimensional, multifluid shearing box MHD simulations, which include
vertical stratification, ionisation chemistry, ohmic resistivity, and
ionisation due to X-rays from the central protostar. We compare the results of
the MHD simulations with a simple reaction-diffusion model.
  The simulations show that in the absence of gas-phase heavy metals, such as
magnesium, turbulent mixing has essentially no effect on the dead zone. The
addition of a relatively low abundance of magnesium, however, increases the
recombination time and allows turbulent mixing of ions to enliven the dead zone
completely beyond a distance of 5 AU from the central star, for our particular
disc model. During the late stages of protoplanetary disc evolution, when small
grains have been depleted and the disc surface density has decreased below its
high initial value, the structure of the dead zone may be significantly altered
by the action of turbulent transport.

equilibrium distribution is the same for all these models, namely a
gamma-distribution with suitably defined temperature and number of dimensions.
This in turn allows one to quantify the inequalities observed in the wealth
distributions and suggests that their origin should be traced back to very
general underlying mechanisms: for instance, it follows that the smaller the

by a non-central chi-square density. First we prove a new representation for
the central chi-square density based on sums of powers of generalized Gaussian
random variables. Second we prove Marsaglia's polar method extends to this
distribution, providing a simple, exact, robust and efficient
acceptance-rejection method for generalized Gaussian sampling and thus central
chi-square sampling. Third we derive a simple, high-accuracy, robust and
efficient direct inversion method for generalized Gaussian sampling based on
the Beasley-Springer-Moro method. Indeed the accuracy of the approximation to
the inverse cumulative distribution function is to the tenth decimal place. We
then apply our methods to non-central chi-square variance sampling in the
Heston model. We focus on the case when the number of degrees of freedom is
small and the zero boundary is attracting and attainable, typical in foreign
exchange markets. Using the additivity property of the chi-square distribution,
our methods apply in all parameter regimes.

properties. This is a monolayer of graphite, and the two-dimensional electrons
and holes in it are described by the effective Dirac equation with a vanishing
effective mass. As a consequence, electromagnetic response of graphene is
predicted to be strongly non-linear. We develop a quasi-classical kinetic
theory of the non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene, taking into
account the self-consistent-field effects. Response of the system to both
harmonic and pulse excitation is considered. The frequency multiplication
effect, resulting from the non-linearity of the electromagnetic response, is
studied under realistic experimental conditions. The frequency up-conversion
efficiency is analysed as a function of the applied electric field and
parameters of the samples. Possible applications of graphene in terahertz
electronics are discussed.

resolution charged particle hodoscopes. Fibres of a column along the
geometrical trajectory of incident particles are typically grouped to one pixel
of a multi-channel read-out device. In some applications the incident particles
will cross the detection plane with large angles w.r.t. the normal to the
layers. Then, the packing of the fibres needs to be adapted to the incident
particles and the columns need to be inclined. In this paper possible fibre
array geometries are shown, relevant design criteria for detectors are
discussed, and the effect of diverging particles incident on fibre arrays was
studied using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Unparticles by themselves are not appropriate for generating the primordial
perturbations since their power spectrum does not match what has been inferred
from observations. In fact, when the scaling dimension for the unparticles
exceeds three-halves, the unparticle power spectrum diverges. However, when a
unparticle couples to an ordinary inflaton particle, loop corrections can
produce a slight enhancement of the inflaton's power spectrum at longer
wavelengths. We examine these loop corrections from unparticles in some detail
to learn how they scale in the wavelength of a perturbation and how they depend
on the scaling dimension of the field.
