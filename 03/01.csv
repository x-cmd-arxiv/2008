estimating the power levels and timing offsets of the ranging subscriber

frequency offsets (CFOs) between the received signals and the base station
local reference. Motivated by the above problem, in the present work we design
a novel ranging scheme for OFDMA in which the ranging signals are assumed to be
misaligned both in time and frequency. Our goal is to estimate the timing
errors and CFOs of each active RSS. Specifically, CFO estimation is
accomplished by resorting to subspacebased methods while a least-squares
approach is employed for timing recovery. Computer simulations are used to
assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make comparisons with
existing alternatives.

(1990 -- 1995, 2000 -- 2007). In addition, maps were obtained of RX Boo with
the Very Large Array over several years. We find that most of the emission in
the circumstellar shell of RX Boo is located in an incomplete ring with an
inner radius of 91 mas (15 AU). A velocity gradient is found in a NW--SE
direction. The maser region can be modelled as a shell with a thickness of 22
AU, which is only partially filled. The gas crossing time is 16.5 years. The
ring-like structure and the velocity gradient remained stable for at least 11
years, while the maser line profiles varied strongly. This suggests that the
spatial asymmetry is not accidental, so that either the mass loss process or
the maser excitation conditions in RX Boo are not spherically symmetric. The
strong variability of the maser spectral features is mainly due to incoherent
intensity fluctuations of maser emission spots, which have lifetimes of the
order of 1 year. We found no correlation between the optical and the maser
variability in either star. The variability properties of the SV Peg masers do
not differ substantially from those of RX Boo. There were fewer spectral
features present, and the range of variations was narrower. The maser was
active on the >10-Jy level only 1990 -- 1992 and 2006/2007. At other times the
maser was either absent (<1 Jy) or barely detectable.

fermions of each pairing partner are unequal. The resulting `imbalanced
superfluid' has been realized experimentally for ultracold atomic gases with
s-wave interactions. Inspired by high-temperature superconductivity, we
investigate the case of d-wave interactions, and find marked differences from
the s-wave superfluid. Whereas s-wave imbalanced Fermi gases tend to phase
separate in real space, in a balanced condensate and an imbalanced normal halo,
we show that the d-wave gas can phase separate in reciprocal space so that
imbalance and superfluidity can coexist spatially. We show that the mechanism
explaining this property is the creation of polarized excitations in the nodes
of the gap. The Sarma mechanism, present only at nonzero temperatures for the
s-wave case, is still applicable in the temperature zero limit for the d-wave
case. As a result, the d-wave BCS superfluid is more robust with respect to
imbalance, and a region of the phase diagram can be identified where the s-wave
BCS superfluidity is suppressed whereas the d-wave superfluidity is not. When
these results are extended into the BEC limit of strongly bound molecules, the
symmetry of the order parameter matters less. The effects of fluctuations
beyond mean field is taken into account in the calculation of the structure
factor and the critical temperature. The poles of the structure factor
(corresponding to bound molecular states) are less damped in the d-wave case as
compared to s-wave. On the BCS side of the unitarity limit, the critical
temperature follows the temperature corresponding to the pair binding energy
and as such will also be more robust against imbalance. Possible routes for the
experimental observation of the d-wave superfluidity have been discussed.

factor due to the interaction with cosmic microwave background and

$\Gamma$ change with redshift $z$. Three methods of spectra calculations are
investigated and compared: {\it (i)} trajectory method, {\it(ii)} kinetic
equation combined with trajectory calculations and {\it (iii)} coupled kinetic
equations. We believe that these three methods exhaust at least the principal
possibilities for any analytic solution of the problem. In the most
straightforward method {\it(i)} only trajectory calculations are used to
connect the observed nuclei flux with the production rate of primary
(accelerated) nuclei $A_0$. In the second method {\it (ii)} the flux (space
density) of primary nuclei, and secondary nuclei and protons are calculated
with the help of kinetic equation and trajectories are used only to determine
the generation rates of these nuclei. The third method {\it (iii)} consists in
solving the complete set of coupled kinetic equations, written starting with
primary nuclei $A_0$, then for $A_0-1$ etc down to the $A$ of interest. The
solution of the preceding equation gives the generation rate for the one which
follows. An important element of the calculations for all methods is the
systematic use of Lorentz factor instead of energy. We consider here the
interaction of nuclei only with the cosmic microwave background, this case is
particularly suitable for understanding the physical results.

subsequent relaxation to local thermal equilibrium. Starting from the
pseudo-Liouville equation for the time evolution of phase-space distributions,
we derive a master equation which governs the energy exchange between the

coefficient of thermal conductivity to the frequency of collision events and
compute these quantities. We also provide estimates of the Lyapunov exponents

fundamental interest, but their reliable manufacture still presents a technical
challenge. To better understand the formation, morphology and ordering of
epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs), it is essential to have an
accurate model that can aid further experiments and predict the trends in SAQD
formation. SAQDs form because of the destabilizing effect of elastic mismatch
strain, but most analytic models and some numerical models of SAQD formation
either assume an elastically homogeneous anisotropic film-substrate system or
assume an elastically heterogeneous isotropic system. In this work, we perform
the full film-substrate elastic calculation. Then we incorporate the elasticity
calculation into a stochastic linear growth model. We find that using
homogeneous elasticity can cause errors in the elastic energy density as large
as 26%, and for typical modeling parameters lead to errors of about 11% in the
estimated value of average dot spacing. We also quantify the effect of elastic
heterogeneity on the order estimates of SAQDs and confirm previous finding on
the possibility of order enhancement by growing a film near the critical film
height.

Markov Chain analysis of the evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters

current observed number of clusters shows good agreement with predictions. We
determine the expected degradation of the constraints as a result of
self-calibrating the luminosity-temperature relation (with scatter), including
temperature measurement errors, and relying on photometric methods for the
estimation of galaxy cluster redshifts. We examine the effects of systematic
errors in scaling relation and measurement error assumptions. Using only (T,z)
self-calibration, we expect to measure Omega_m to +-0.03 (and Omega_Lambda to
the same accuracy assuming flatness), and sigma_8 to +-0.05, also constraining
the normalization and slope of the luminosity-temperature relation to +-6 and
+-13 per cent (at 1sigma) respectively in the process. Self-calibration fails
to jointly constrain the scatter and redshift evolution of the
luminosity-temperature relation significantly. Additional archival and/or
follow-up data will improve on this. We do not expect measurement errors or
imperfect knowledge of their distribution to degrade constraints significantly.
Scaling-relation systematics can easily lead to cosmological constraints 2sigma
or more away from the fiducial model. Our treatment is the first exact
treatment to this level of detail, and introduces a new `smoothed ML' estimate
of expected constraints.

the first discovery of an ionised component of the supershell, in the form of

of cold dark matter. In such scenarios, gluino production events at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider should be rich in top and bottom quark jets. Requiring
b-jets in addition to missing transverse energy should, therefore, enhance the
supersymmetry signal relative to Standard Model backgrounds from V + jet, VV

reach of the LHC from b-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models of
supersymmetry. We also explore ``top-tagging'' at the LHC. We find that while
the efficiency for this turns out to be too low to give an increase in reach
beyond that obtained via b-tagging, top-tagging can indeed provide a
confirmatory signal if gluinos are not too heavy. Finally, we explore the
prospects for detecting the direct production of third generation squarks in
models with an inverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by b-jets +
missing transverse energy events harder than in the Standard Model, but softer
than those from the production of gluinos and heavier squarks. We find that
while these events can be readily separated from SM background (for third
generation squark masses ~300-500 GeV), the contamination from the much heavier
gluinos and squarks remains formidable if these are also accessible.

Milky Way is taken as an example). It is driven by scattering off of dark
matter particles by bulge stars, their absorption by the supermassive black
hole and self-annihilation. This process is described by diffusion equation in
the phase space of energy and angular momentum. The equation was integrated for
several different models of initial dark matter distribution and using various
assumptions about the dynamical factors. It turns out that because the Milky
Way center is rather dynamically old (~5 relaxation times t_r), the difference
in initial conditions almost vanishes. The density attains a nearly universal
profile, and the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation lies in rather
narrow range, which enables more robust determination of the dark matter
parameters. By present time the mass of dark matter inside the black hole
sphere of influence (r<2 pc) has been reduced approximately twice, mostly
because of heating by stars. It is shown that the dynamics of dark matter for
t>t_r is determined mainly by stars outside the sphere of influence.

significant tidal evolution since the time of their formation. Tides probably
dominated their orbital evolution once the dust and gas had cleared away, and
as the orbits evolved there was substantial tidal heating within the planets.
The tidal heating history of each planet may have contributed significantly to
the thermal budget that governed the planet's physical properties, including
its radius, which in many cases may be measured by observing transit events.
Typically, tidal heating increases as a planet moves inward toward its star and
then decreases as its orbit circularizes. Here we compute the plausible heating
histories for several planets with measured radii, using the same tidal
parameters for the star and planet that had been shown to reconcile the
eccentricity distribution of close-in planets with other extra-solar planets.
Several planets are discussed, including for example HD 209458 b, which may
have undergone substantial tidal heating during the past billion years, perhaps
enough to explain its large measured radius. Our models also show that GJ 876 d
may have experienced tremendous heating and is probably not a solid, rocky
planet. Theoretical models should include the role of tidal heating, which is
large, but time-varying.

through the conduction electrons of the metal. This indirect exchange coupling,
known to occur for a variety of magnetic materials embedded in several
different metallic structures, is of rather long range, especially for
low-dimensional structures like carbon nanotubes. Motivated by recent claims
that the indirect coupling between magnetic moments in precessional motion has
a much longer range than its static counterpart, here we consider how magnetic
atoms adsorbed to the walls of a metallic nanotube respond to a time-dependent
perturbation that induces their magnetic moments to precess. By calculating the
frequency-dependent spin susceptibility we are able to identify resonant peaks
whose respective widths provide information about the dynamic aspect of the
indirect exchange coupling. We show that by departing from a purely static
representation to another in which the moments are allowed to precess, we
change from what is already considered a long range interaction to another
whose range is far superior. In other words, localized magnetic moments
embedded in a metallic structure can feel each other's presence more easily
when they are set in precessional motion. We argue that such an effect can have
useful applications leading to large-scale spintronics devices.

Reasoning
about privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant
is the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background
knowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels
such as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how
one can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of
auxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of
current anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations
independently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We
investigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent
anonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models
of limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our
experiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can
breach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques.
The class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more
positive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as
differential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use
of arbitrary side information. This resistance enables stand-alone design of
anonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other
releases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an
important class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the
property. This significantly enlarges the class of protocols known to enable
modular design.

based on holistic approach wherein analysis is a direct product of synthesis.
The core of the method is iterative averaging of all the elements of a system
according to all the parameters describing the elements. Contrary to common
logic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in
homogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of
the system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of
the formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the
value of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different
subgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When
subjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more
elements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo
such a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative
averaging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical
system that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system
under analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist
only in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon
providing such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with
each other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can
be achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's
elements. We demonstrate the application potentials of the proposed technology
on a number of examples, including a system of scattered points, randomized
datasets, as well as meteorological and demographical datasets.

field on the dynamics of fundamental flavours in both the confined and
deconfined phases of a large N_c gauge theory. We find that an external
magnetic field promotes chiral symmetry breaking, consistent with the ""magnetic
catalysis"" observed in the field theory literature, and seen in other studies
using holographic duals. The external field increases the separation between
the deconfinement temperature and the chiral symmetry restoring temperature. In
the deconfined phase we investigate the temperature-magnetic field phase
diagram and observe, for example, there exists a maximum critical temperature
(at which symmetry is restored) for very large magnetic field. We find that
this and certain other phenomena persist for the Sakai-Sugimoto type models
with probe branes of diverse dimensions. We comment briefly on the dynamics in
the presence of an external electric field.

sparse, non-symmetric systems. It is often preferred for the sake of its
stability. We present TPILU(k), the first efficiently parallelized ILU(k)
preconditioner that maintains this important stability property. Even better,
TPILU(k) preconditioning produces an answer that is bit-compatible with the
sequential ILU(k) preconditioning. In terms of performance, the TPILU(k)
preconditioning is shown to run faster whenever more cores are made available
to it --- while continuing to be as stable as sequential ILU(k). This is in
contrast to some competing methods that may become unstable if the degree of
thread parallelism is raised too far. Where Block Jacobi ILU(k) fails in an
application, it can be replaced by TPILU(k) in order to maintain good
performance, while also achieving full stability. As a further optimization,
TPILU(k) offers an optional level-based incomplete inverse method as a fast
approximation for the original ILU(k) preconditioned matrix. Although this
enhancement is not bit-compatible with classical ILU(k), it is bit-compatible
with the output from the single-threaded version of the same algorithm. In
experiments on a 16-core computer, the enhanced TPILU(k)-based iterative linear
solver performed up to 9 times faster. As we approach an era of many-core
computing, the ability to efficiently take advantage of many cores will become
ever more important. TPILU(k) also demonstrates good performance on cluster or
Grid. For example, the new algorithm achieves 50 times speedup with 80 nodes
for general sparse matrices of dimension 160,000 that are diagonally dominant.

significantly extended along the minor axis of the galaxy suggesting that it
may be outflowing in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk. The mass

the star-forming regions. The L_X/SFR ratio equals ~ 9 x 10^38

earlier from Chandra observations of other nearby galaxies.

over the exterior algebra E. At first we study homological properties of
E-modules as e.g. complexity, depth and regularity. In particular, we consider
modules with linear injective resolutions. We apply our results to
Orlik-Solomon algebras of matroids and give formulas for the complexity, depth
and regularity of such rings in terms of invariants of the matroid. Moreover,
we characterize those matroids whose Orlik-Solomon ideal has a linear
projective resolution and compute in these cases the Betti numbers of the
ideal.

the variation interval of $E$ is to be $[0,\frac{1}{\lambda}[$. Then, we extend

captures on Fe nuclei. A nickel overabundance would corroborate this idea.
Consequently we are looking for nickel lines in PG1159 stars. Prime targets are
relatively cool objects, because Ni VI is the dominant ionisation stage and the
spectral lines of this ion are accessible with UV observations. We do not find
such lines in the coolest PG1159 star observed by FUSE (PG1707+427, Teff =
85,000 K) and conclude that the nickel abundance is not enhanced. Hence, the
Fe-deficiency in PG1159 stars remains unexplained. In addition, we present
results of a wind analysis of the hybrid-PG1159 star NGC 7094 and the
[WC]-PG1159 transition-type object Abell 78 in order to derive F abundances
from the F VI 1139.5 Angstrom line. In both cases, we find F overabundances, in
agreement with results of photospheric analyses of many PG1159 stars.
Surprisingly, we find indications for a very low O abundance in NGC 7094.

antiferromagnets are discussed. Finally, results of quantum Monte Carlo
simulations for the S=1/2 XXZ model on a square lattice are presented, and

modeled by Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons is studied in this paper. We focus on
the ability of additive temporally and spatially uncorrelated Gaussian noise to
extract a particular spatial frequency of excitatory waves in the medium,
whereby examining also the impact of diffusive and small-world network topology
determining the interactions amongst coupled HH neurons. We show that there
exists an intermediate noise intensity that is able to extract a characteristic
spatial frequency of the system in a resonant manner provided the latter is
diffusively coupled, thus indicating the existence of spatial coherence
resonance. However, as the diffusive topology of the medium is relaxed via the
introduction of shortcut links introducing small-world properties amongst
coupled HH neurons, the ability of additive Gaussian noise to evoke ordered
excitatory waves deteriorates rather spectacularly, leading to the decoherence
of the spatial dynamics and with it related absence of spatial coherence
resonance. In particular, already a minute fraction of shortcut links suffices
to substantially disrupt coherent pattern formation in the examined system.
