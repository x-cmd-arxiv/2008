Thiemann","Automated Termination Proofs for Logic Programs by Term Rewriting","49 pages",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two kinds of approaches for termination analysis of logic programs:
""transformational"" and ""direct"" ones. Direct approaches prove termination
directly on the basis of the logic program. Transformational approaches
transform a logic program into a term rewrite system (TRS) and then analyze
termination of the resulting TRS instead. Thus, transformational approaches
make all methods previously developed for TRSs available for logic programs as
well. However, the applicability of most existing transformations is quite
restricted, as they can only be used for certain subclasses of logic programs.
(Most of them are restricted to well-moded programs.) In this paper we improve
these transformations such that they become applicable for any definite logic
program. To simulate the behavior of logic programs by TRSs, we slightly modify
the notion of rewriting by permitting infinite terms. We show that our
transformation results in TRSs which are indeed suitable for automated
termination analysis. In contrast to most other methods for termination of
logic programs, our technique is also sound for logic programming without occur
check, which is typically used in practice. We implemented our approach in the
termination prover AProVE and successfully evaluated it on a large collection
of examples.

array were used to make the first direct measurements of the angular beaming
patterns of individual bursts. By comparing the spacecraft locations and AKR
burst locations, the angular beaming pattern was found to be narrowly confined
to a plane containing the magnetic field vector at the source and tangent to a
circle of constant latitude. Most rays paths are confined within 15 deg of this
tangent plane, consistent with numerical simulations of AKR k-vector
orientation at maximum growth rate. The emission is also strongly directed
upward in the tangent plane, which we interpret as refraction of the rays as
they leave the auroral cavity. The narrow beaming pattern implies that an
observer located above the polar cap can detect AKR emission only from a small
fraction of the auroral oval at a given location. This has important
consequences for interpreting AKR visibility at a given location. It also helps
re-interpret previously published Cluster VLBI studies of AKR source locations,
which are now seen to be only a subset of all possible source locations. These
observations are inconsistent with either filled or hollow cone beaming models.

are associated with core-collapse supernovae (SNe), so far only four pairs of
GRBs and SNe with firmly established connection have been found. All the four
GRB-SNe are among a special class of Type Ic--called the broad-lined SNe
indicative of a large explosion energy, suggesting that only a small fraction
of SNe Ibc have GRBs associated with them. This scheme has been refreshed by
the discovery of a bright X-ray transient in NGC 2770 on 9 January 2008, which
was followed by a rather normal Type Ib SN 2008D. In this paper, I argue that
the transient 080109 is an X-ray flash (XRF, the soft version of a GRB) because
of the following evidences: (1) The transient cannot be interpreted as a SN
shock breakout event; (2) The GRB X-ray flare interpretation is not supported
by the high-energy observation. Then I show that XRF 080109 satisfies the
well-known relation between the isotropic-equivalent energy and the peak
spectral energy for LGRBs, which highly strengthens the XRF interpretation.
Finally, I point out that, the peak spectral energy of XRF 080109 and the
maximum bolometric luminosity of SN 2008D agree with the
$E_{\gamma,\p}$--$L_{{\rm SN},\max}$ relationship of Li (2006), strengthening
the validity of the relationship. I speculate that events like XRF 080109 may
occur at a rate comparable to SNe Ibc, and a soft X-ray telescope devoted to
surveying for nearby X-ray flares will be very fruitful in discovering them.

versus variations in the strengths of emission or reflection components.
Diagnostics of the inner regions of AGN cannot be reliably performed until the
origin of observed effects is understood. We investigate the role of the X-ray
absorbers in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3516. Time-averaged and flux-selected
spectroscopy is used to examine the behavior of NGC 3516 observed in Chandra
HETG and XMM data from Oct 2006. New H-like and He-like emission and absorption
features discovered in the Fe K regime reveal a previously unknown zone of
circumnuclear gas in NGC 3516 with log xi ~ 4.3 and column density 1E23 cm^-2.
A lower-ionization layer with log xi ~2 and of similar column density is
confirmed from previous observations, this layer has a covering fraction around
50%, and changes in covering provide a simple explanation of a deep dip in the
light curve that we interpret as an eclipse of the continuum due to passage of
a cloud across the sight line within half a day. These inner zones of absorbing
gas are detected to have outflow velocities in the range 1000-2000 km/s, this,
and constraints on radial location are consistent with an origin as part of a
disk wind in NGC 3516.

companion galaxy at a similar redshift. Near-infrared imaging observations
obtained using the NTT are used to analyse the underlying galaxy morphologies.
The EELR displays a complex variety of different gas kinematics and ionization
states, consistent with a mixture of radio source shocks and AGN
photoionization. The radio galaxy is likely to lie within a group environment,
and is plausibly undergoing interactions with one or more other objects. The
disk-like galaxy to the northeast of the radio source lies at a similar
redshift to the radio galaxy itself, and has its major axis position angle
aligned with the filamentary continuum and line emission extending outwards
from the radio galaxy. This filamentary structure is most plausibly interpreted
as a tidal structure associated with an interaction involving the radio source
host galaxy and the aligned companion galaxy to the north-east; this encounter
may have potentially triggered the current epoch of radio source activity.
Overall, PKS2250-41 displays some of the best evidence that radio source
activity can be triggered in this manner. [abridged]

simple collective (""geared"") pattern when studied by fluorescence near its

understand this ""plastic"" pattern by taking advantage of a symmetric 45-atom
carbohydrate molecular bridge to ""cross over"" from proteins to inorganic
network glasses. There one easily identifies gears, and can show that the
collective pattern is the signature of nonlocal, water-mediated
[hydro(phobic/philic)] switching. Details of the transition patterns emerge
from analyzing the amino acid alpha helical repeat sequences with water-only

configurations, there exists a continuum gapless spectrum of KK modes with any
$m^2>0$ for scalars, vectors and ones of left chiral and right chiral fermions.
All of the corresponding massless modes are found to be normalizable on the

These potentials suggest that there exist mass gap and a series of continuous

determined by the coupling constant $\eta$. In the case of no coupling

It allows for a direct comparison between quantum and classical dynamics,
providing insight into the relations between quantum and classical behavior,
while also revealing a smooth transition between quantum and classical time
evolutions. In particular, the $\hbar\to 0$ limit of the quantum equations of

accumulating in the past years. HI observations of galaxies and their
environment have brought to light new facts and phenomena which are evidence of
ongoing or recent accretion:
  1) A large number of galaxies are accompanied by gas-rich dwarfs or are
surrounded by HI cloud complexes, tails and filaments. It may be regarded as
direct evidence of cold gas accretion in the local universe. It is probably the
same kind of phenomenon of material infall as the stellar streams observed in
the halos of our galaxy and M31. 2) Considerable amounts of extra-planar HI
have been found in nearby spiral galaxies. While a large fraction of this gas
is produced by galactic fountains, it is likely that a part of it is of
extragalactic origin. 3) Spirals are known to have extended and warped outer
layers of HI. It is not clear how these have formed, and how and for how long
the warps can be sustained. Gas infall has been proposed as the origin. 4) The
majority of galactic disks are lopsided in their morphology as well as in their
kinematics. Also here recent accretion has been advocated as a possible cause.
  In our view, accretion takes place both through the arrival and merging of
gas-rich satellites and through gas infall from the intergalactic medium (IGM).
The infall may have observable effects on the disk such as bursts of star
formation and lopsidedness. We infer a mean ``visible'' accretion rate of cold
gas in galaxies of at least 0.2 Msol/yr. In order to reach the accretion rates
needed to sustain the observed star formation (~1 Msol/yr), additional infall
of large amounts of gas from the IGM seems to be required.

phenomenon. A prominent example is virus capsid growth, whose underlying
behavior can be modeled using simple particles that assemble into polyhedral
shells. Molecular dynamics simulation of shell formation in the presence of an
atomistic solvent provides new insight into the self-assembly mechanism,
notably that growth proceeds via a cascade of strongly reversible steps and,
despite the large variety of possible intermediates, only a small fraction of
highly bonded forms appear on the pathway.

of such nebulae within the context of containment against cross-field diffusion
(versus normal advection), the effect of reverse shocks on the evolution of
offset ``Vela-like'' PWN, constraints on maximum particle energetics, magnetic
field strength estimates based on spectral and spatial properties, and the
implication of such field estimates on the composition of the wind. A
significant part of the discussion is based on the High Energy Stereoscopic
System ({\it H.E.S.S.} or {\it HESS}) detection of the two evolved pulsar wind
nebulae Vela X (cocoon) and HESS J1825-137. In the case of Vela X (cocoon) we
also review evidence of a hadronic versus a leptonic interpretation, showing
that a leptonic interpretation is favored for the {\it HESS} signal. The
constraints discussed in this review paper sets a general framework for the
interpretation of a number of offset, filled-center nebulae seen by {\it HESS}.
These sources are found along the galactic plane with galactic latitudes
$|b|\sim 0$, where significant amounts of molecular gas is found. In these
regions, we find that the interstellar medium is inhomogeneous, which has an
effect on the morphology of supernova shock expansion. One consequence of this
effect is the formation of offset pulsar wind nebulae as observed.

covering a 50' x 50' field, we study the mass functions (MFs) of nine open
clusters. The ages and Galactocentric distances of the target clusters vary
from 16 - 2000 Myr and 9-10.8 kpc, respectively. The values of MF slopes vary
from -1.1 to -2.1. The classical value derived by Salpeter (1955) for the slope
of the IMF is \Gamma = -1.35. The MFs in the outer regions of the clusters are
found to be steeper than in the inner regions, indicating the presence of mass
segregation in the clusters.The MF slopes (in the outer region as well as the
whole cluster) undergo an exponential decay with the evolutionary parameter
\tau (= age/ relaxation time). It seems that the evaporation of low-mass
members from outer regions of the clusters is not significant at larger
Galactocentric distances. It is concluded that the initial mass function (IMF)
in the anticentre direction of the Galaxy might have been steeper than the IMF
in the opposite direction. A comparison of the observed CMDs of the clusters
with synthetic CMDs gives a photometric binary content of ~40%.

transformation of this vector. Moreover, when two manifolds are glued by their
common boundary, these vectors undergo scalar multiplication, i.e., they work
according to M. Atiyah's axioms for a topological quantum field theory.

Magnitude of the effect can be artificially increased by stimulating properly
selected spin-orbit scattering events. Already achieved sensitivity of the
EHE-based sample devices exceeds 1000 Ohm/T, which surpasses the sensitivity of
semiconducting Hall sensors. Linear field response, thermal stability, high
frequency operation, sub-micron dimensions and, above all, simplicity,
robustness and low cost manufacture are good reasons to consider a wide scale
technological application of the phenomenon for magnetic sensors and memory
devices.

that spacetime diffeomorphisms be represented within its equal-time phase
space. In accordance with the principle of general covariance, the time mapping
${\T}: {\yman} \to {\rman}$ and the space mapping ${\X}: {\yman} \to {\xman}$
that define the Dirac-ADM foliation are incorporated into the framework of the
Hilbert variational principle. The resulting canonical action encompasses all
individual Dirac-ADM actions, corresponding to different choices of foliating
vacuum spacetimes by spacelike hypersurfaces. In this framework, spacetime
observables, namely, dynamical variables that are invariant under spacetime
diffeomorphisms, are not necessarily invariant under the deformations of the
mappings $\T$ and $\X$, nor are they constants of the motion. Dirac observables
form only a subset of spacetime observables that are invariant under the
transformations of $\T$ and $\X$ and do not evolve in time. The conventional
interpretation of the canonical theory, due to Bergmann and Dirac, can be
recovered only by postulating that the transformations of the reference system
$({\T},{\X})$ have no measurable consequences. If this postulate is not deemed
necessary, covariant canonical gravity admits no classical problem of time.
