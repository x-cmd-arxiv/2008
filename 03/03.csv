~10^57 erg/s in gravitational waves (GWs). As the GWs propagate through ambient
gas, they induce shear and a small fraction of their power is dissipated
through viscosity. The dissipated heat appears as electromagnetic (EM)
radiation, providing a prompt EM counterpart to the GW signal. For thin
accretion disks, the GW heating rate exceeds the accretion power at distances
farther than 10^3 Schwarzschild radii, independently of the accretion rate and
viscosity coefficient.

linear as well as nonlinear magnetic susceptibilities and resistivity
measurements across the 2nd order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition
($T_C$) and 1st order ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition ($T_N$). We
found that the ferromagnetic (metallic) clusters, which form with the onset of
long-range order in the system at $T_C$, continuously decrease their size with
the decrease in temperature and coexist with non-ferromagnetic (insulating)
clusters. These non-ferromagnetic clusters are identified to be
antiferromagnetic. Significantly, it is shown that they do not arise because of
the superheating effect of the lower temperature 1st order transition. Thus
reveals unique phase coexistence in a manganite around half-doping encompassing
two long-range order transitions. Both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
clusters form at $T_C$ and persist much below $T_N$. Substitution of quenched
disorder (Ga) at Mn-site promotes antiferromagnetism at the cost of
ferromagnetism without adding any magnetic interaction or introducing any
significant lattice distortion. Moreover, increase in disorder decreases the
ferromagnetic cluster size and with 7.5% Ga substitution clusters size reduces
to the single domain limit. Yet, all the samples show significant short-range
ferromagnetic interaction much above $T_C$. Resistivity measurements also
reveal the novel phase coexistence identified from the magnetic measurements.
It is significant that, increase in disorder up to 7.5% increases the
resistivity of the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase by about four
orders.

domain-wall valence quarks and Asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks. At the
level of the chiral effective Lagrangian, discretization effects in the
mixed-action theory give rise to two new parameters as compared to the lowest
order Lagrangian for staggered fermions -- the residual quark mass, m_res, and
the mixed valence-sea meson mass-splitting, Delta_mix. We find that the size of
m_res is approximately four times smaller than our lightest valence quark mass
on our coarser lattice spacing, and comparable to that of simulations by RBC
and UKQCD. We also find that the size of Delta_mix is comparable to the
smallest of the staggered meson taste-splittings measured by MILC. Because
lattice artifacts are different in the valence and sea sectors of the
mixed-action theory, they give rise to unitarity-violating effects that
disappear in the continuum limit. Such effects are expected to be mild for many
quantities of interest, but are significant in the case of the isovector scalar
(a_0) correlator. Specifically, once m_res, Delta_mix, and two other parameters
that can be determined from the light pseudoscalar spectrum are known, the
two-particle intermediate state ""bubble"" contribution to the scalar correlator
is completely predicted within mixed-action chiral perturbation theory
(MAChPT). We find that the behavior of the scalar meson correlator is
quantitatively consistent with the MAChPT prediction; this supports the claim
that MAChPT describes the dominant unitarity-violating effects in the
mixed-action theory and can be used to remove lattice artifacts and recover
physical quantities.

to one-magnon van-Hove singularities. We find that 1/S self-energy corrections
to the one-magnon spectrum strongly modify this intensity profile. The central
Raman-peak is significantly enhanced due to plateaus in the magnon dispersion,
the high frequency peak is suppressed due to magnon damping, and the overall
spectral support narrows considerably. Additionally we investigate final-state
interactions by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation to $O(1/S)$. In contrast to
collinear antiferromagnets, the non-collinear nature of the magnetic ground
state leads to an irreducible magnon scattering which is retarded and
non-separable already to lowest order. We show that final-state interactions
lead to a rather broad Raman-continuum centered around approximately twice the
'roton'-energy. We also discuss the dependence on the scattering geometry.

1 x 10^(-17) cm^(3) s^(-1)) along lines of sight with low column density (A_V <

The lower rate at low column densities could be the result of grain processing
by interstellar shocks which may deplete the grain surface area or process the
sites of H +H formation, thereby inhibiting H_2 production. Alternatively, the
formation rate may be normal, and the low molecular fraction may be the result
of lines of sight which graze larger clouds. Such lines of sight would have a
reduced H_2 self-shielding compared to the line-of-sight column. We find the

  May 2010 32:5 889-898",,,"cs.CV cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partitioning and grouping of similar objects plays a fundamental role in
image segmentation and in clustering problems. In such problems a typical goal
is to group together similar objects, or pixels in the case of image
processing. At the same time another goal is to have each group distinctly
dissimilar from the rest and possibly to have the group size fairly large.
These goals are often combined as a ratio optimization problem. One example of
such problem is the normalized cut problem, another is the ratio regions
problem. We devise here the first polynomial time algorithms solving these
problems optimally. The algorithms are efficient and combinatorial. This
contrasts with the heuristic approaches used in the image segmentation
literature that formulate those problems as nonlinear optimization problems,
which are then relaxed and solved with spectral techniques in real numbers.
These approaches not only fail to deliver an optimal solution, but they are
also computationally expensive. The algorithms presented here use as a
subroutine a minimum $s,t-cut procedure on a related graph which is of
polynomial size. The output consists of the optimal solution to the respective
ratio problem, as well as a sequence of nested solution with respect to any
relative weighting of the objectives of the numerator and denominator.
  An extension of the results here to bi-criteria and multi-criteria objective
functions is presented in part II.

v < 500 km/s, r_p < 80 kpc and stellar mass ratio 0.1 < M_1/M_2 < 10 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4). In agreement with
previous studies, we find an enhancement in the star formation rate (SFR) of
galaxy pairs at projected separations < 30--40 kpc. In addition, we find that
this enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) for
galaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called `major' pairs. However, SFR
enhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses are
within a factor of 10 of each other. In agreement with the one previous study
of the luminosity-metallicity (LZ) relation in paired galaxies, we find an
offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.1 dex) for a given luminosity for
galaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. We also present the first
mass-metallicity (MZ) relation comparison between paired galaxies and the
field, and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.05 dex) for a
given mass. The smaller offset in the MZ relation indicates that both higher
luminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairs
relative to the control in the LZ relation. We show that the offset in the LZ
relation depends on galaxy half light radius, r_h. Galaxies with r_h < 3 kpc
and with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downwards offset in metallicity
compared to control galaxies of the same size. Finally, we study the AGN
fraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selecting

stability proofs. The proposed decentralized tracking control law synchronizes
the attitude of an arbitrary number of spacecraft into a common time-varying
trajectory with global exponential convergence. Moreover, a decentralized
translational tracking control law based on phase synchronization is presented,
thus enabling coupled translational and rotational maneuvers. While the
translational dynamics can be adequately controlled by linear control laws, the
proposed method permits highly nonlinear systems with nonlinearly coupled
inertia matrices such as the attitude dynamics of spacecraft whose large and
rapid slew maneuvers justify the nonlinear control approach. The proposed
method integrates both the trajectory tracking and synchronization problems in

the south-west with Suzaku in seven pointings. After dividing the entire fields
of view (FOV) into 119 cells, we extracted spectra from all of the cells and
performed spectral analysis for them. We then applied both one- and
two-component non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models for all of the spectra,
finding that almost all were significantly better fitted by the two-component
NEI model rather than the one-component NEI model. Judging from the abundances,
the high-kT_e component must be the ejecta component, while the low-kT_e
component comes from the swept-up matter. Therefore, the ejecta turn out to be
distributed inside a large area (at least our FOV) of the Cygnus Loop. We
divided the entire FOV into northern and southern parts, and found that the
ejecta distributions were asymmetric to the geometric center: the ejecta of Si,
S, and Fe seem to be distributed more in the south than in the north of the
Cygnus Loop by a factor of about 2. The degree of ejecta-asymmetry is
consistent with that expected by recent supernova explosion models.

and Capel, we prove unexpected connections among the asymptotic behavior of the

polynomials that we call the Ginzburg-Landau polynomials. The model depends on
the parameters n, beta, and K, which represent, respectively, the number of
spins, the inverse temperature, and the interaction strength. Our main focus is
on the asymptotic behavior of the magnetization m(beta_n,K_n) for appropriate
sequences (beta_n,K_n) that converge to a second-order point or to the
tricritical point of the model and that lie inside various subsets of the
phase-coexistence region. The main result states that as (beta_n,K_n) converges
to one of these points (beta,K), m(beta_n,K_n) ~ c |beta - beta_n|^gamma --> 0.
In this formula gamma is a positive constant, and c is the unique positive,
global minimum point of a certain polynomial g that we call the Ginzburg-Landau
polynomial. This polynomial arises as a limit of appropriately scaled
free-energy functionals, the global minimum points of which define the
phase-transition structure of the model. For each sequence (beta_n,K_n) under
study, the structure of the global minimum points of the associated
Ginzburg-Landau polynomial mirrors the structure of the global minimum points
of the free-energy functional in the region through which (beta_n,K_n) passes
and thus reflects the phase-transition structure of the model in that region.
The properties of the Ginzburg-Landau polynomials make rigorous the predictions
of the Ginzburg-Landau phenomenology of critical phenomena, and the asymptotic
formula for m(beta_n,K_n) makes rigorous the heuristic scaling theory of the

Experimental measurements for various laser power densities and transit
relaxation times are compared with a model based on the optical Bloch
equations, which averages over the Doppler contour of the absorption line and
simultaneously takes into account all hyperfine levels, as well as mixing of
magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field. In contrast to previous
studies, which could not resolve the hyperfine transitions because of Doppler
broadening, in this study there is excellent agreement between experiment and

according to which these effects are related to the relative strengths of

evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion (A-A) collisions by studying the
suppression of hard probes in an A-A environment as compared to the baseline
process known from p-p collisions. The suppression of back-to-back correlations
in heavy-ion collisions allows, due to a different geometrical bias, a view
into the medium which is qualitatively different from the one offered by single
hadron suppression. A control parameter for the suppression corresponding to a
systematic variation of in-medium pathlengths and density can be obtained by
studying collisions at finite impact parameter b. A systematic variation of
pathlength can then be introduced by studying the suppression pattern as a
function of the angle phi with the reaction plane. Using a 3-d hydrodynamical
evolution model for the medium and a Monte-Carlo model which has been shown to
successfully reproduce the measured suppression of back-to-back correlations in
central collisions of Au-Au at 200 AGeV, we compute the suppression as a
function of phi for b of 2.4 fm. 4.5 fm, 6.3 fm and 7.5 fm. Given that this
involves variations in both control parameters b and phi a comparison with data
should eventually allow to place strong constraints on the combination of
energy loss model and medium evolution model.

by the forthcoming NASA SMEX mission IBEX. Aims: To investigate by numerical
simulations the absolute density and flux at Earth orbit of neutral
interstellar D and to check its detectability by IBEX. Methods: The simulations
were performed with the use of the Warsaw 3D time-dependent test-particle model
of neutral interstellar gas in the inner heliosphere, specially adapted to the
case of D, and of the state-of-the-art models of the ionization field and
radiation pressure. The modeling returned density, bulk velocity, and flux of
interstellar D along at the Earth locations during the solar cycle. Particular
attention was paid to the time interval corresponding to the planned operations
of IBEX. Results: Simulations predict a large enhancement of D abundance at
Earth orbit with respect to the abundance at the termination shock. The energy
of the D atoms at IBEX will be within the energetic sensitivity band of its Lo
instrument except a short time interval between September and November each
year. Because of the specific observing geometry of IBEX, there will be one
opportunity each year to search for I/S D, when Earth is near ecliptic
longitude 136 deg, i.e. in February. Assuming the TS abundance of D identical
as in the Local Cloud equal to 1.56E-5, and the density of H at TS 0.11/cm2/s
one obtains the expected relative flux about 0.015/cm2/s, which corresponds to
the local absolute flux about 0.007/cm2/s. The dependence of the expected flux
on the phase of solar cycle is relatively weak. The flux scales proportionally
to the density of deuterium at the termination shock and depends only weakly on
the bulk velocity and temperature of the gas in this region.

radiative zone that represents 98% of the Sun's total mass. It is usually
assumed that high-frequency g modes give information about the structure of the
solar interior whereas low-frequency g modes are more sensitive to the solar
dynamics (the internal rotation). In this work, we develop a new methodology,
based on the analysis of the almost constant separation of the dipole gravity
modes, to introduce new constraints on the solar models. To validate this
analysis procedure, several solar models -- including different physical
processes and either old or new chemical abundances (from, respectively,
Grevesse and Noels (Origin and evolution of the elements. Cambridge, England,
199, 15, 1993) and Asplund, Grevesse, and Sauval (Astron. Soc. Pac. CS, San
Francisco, 36, 25, 2005)) -- have been compared to another model used as a
reference. The analysis clearly shows that this methodology has enough
sensitivity to distinguish between some of the models, in particular, between
those with different compositions. The comparison of the models with the g-mode
asymptotic signature detected in GOLF data favors the ones with old abundances.
Therefore, the physics of the core -- through the analysis of the g-mode
properties -- is in agreement with the results obtained in the previous studies
based on the acoustic modes, which are mostly sensitive to more external layers

interpreted only as a very helium rich population. The evidence comes from the
presence of a ""blue"" main sequence in $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808, and from the
the very peculiar horizontal branch morphology in NGC 6441 and NGC 6388.
Although a general consensus is emerging on the fact that self--enrichment is a
common feature among GCs, the helium content required for these stars is
Y$\simgt$0.35, and it is difficult to understand how it can be produced without
any --or, for $\omega$ Cen, without a considerable--associated metal
enhancement. We examine the possible role of super--AGB stars, and show that
they may provide the required high helium. However, the ejecta of the most
massive super--AGBs show a global CNO enrichment by a factor of $\simeq$4, due
to the dredge--out process occurring at the second dredge up stage. If these
clusters show no evidence for this CNO enrichment, we can rule out that at
least the most massive super--AGBs evolve into O--Ne white dwarfs and take part
in the formation of the second generation stars. This latter hypothesis may
help to explain the high number of neutron stars present in GCs. The most
massive super--AGBs would in fact evolve into electron--capture supernovae.
Their envelopes would be easily ejected out of the cluster, but the remnant
neutron stars remain into the clusters, thanks to their small supernova natal
kicks.

character due to the compensation of quadratic Zeeman effect and trap energy.
These resonances are absent in spinor condensates and pseudo-spin-1/2 Fermi
gases, being a characteristic feature of high-spin Fermi gases that allows
spinor physics at large magnetic fields. We analyze these resonances in detail
for the case of lattice spinor fermions, showing that they permit to
selectively target a spin-changing channel while suppressing all others. These
resonances allow for the controlled creation of non-trivial quantum
superpositions of many-particle states with entangled spin and trap degrees of
freedom, which remarkably are magnetic-field insensitive. Finally, we show that
the intersite tunneling may lead to a quantum phase transition described by an
effective quantum Ising model.

blueshifts (`blue outliers'), originally identified because of their strong
deviation from the M_BH - sigma relation of normal, narrow-line Seyfert 1
(NLS1) and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxies. These blue outliers turn out
to be important test-beds for models of the narrow-line region (NLR), for
mechanisms of driving large-scale outflows, for links between NLS1 galaxies and
radio galaxies, and for orientation-dependent NLS1 models. We report the
detection of a strong correlation of line blueshift with ionization potential
in each galaxy, including the measurement of coronal lines with radial
velocities up to 500--1000 km/s. All [OIII] blue outliers have narrow widths of
their broad Balmer lines and high Eddington ratios. While the presence of
non-shifted low-ionization lines signifies the presence of a classical outer
quiescent NLR in blue outliers, we also report the absence of any second,
non-blueshifted [OIII] component from a classical inner NLR. These results
place tight constraints on NLR models. We favor a scenario in which the NLR
clouds are entrained in a decelerating wind which explains the strong
stratification and the absence of a zero-blueshift inner NLR of blue outliers.
The origin of the wind remains speculative at this time (collimated radio
plasma, thermal winds, radiatively accelerated clouds). It is perhaps linked to
the high Eddington ratios of blue outliers. Similar, less powerful winds could
be present in all Seyfert galaxies, but would generally only affect the coronal
line region (CLR), or level off even before reaching the CLR. Similarities
between blue outliers in NLS1 galaxies and (compact) radio sources are briefly
discussed.

the emergence of the small world phenomenon, i.e., the statistical observation
that any pair of individuals are linked by a short chain of acquaintances
computable by a simple decentralized routing algorithm, known as greedy
routing. Previously proposed dynamical processes enabled to demonstrate
experimentally (by simulations) that the small world phenomenon can emerge from
local dynamics. However, the analysis of greedy routing using the probability
distributions arising from these dynamics is quite complex because of mutual
dependencies. In contrast, our process enables complete formal analysis. It is
based on the combination of two simple processes: a random walk process, and an
harmonic forgetting process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the
individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances.
We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two
processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a
k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the
stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps
for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a
polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice.
Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that navigability
in small worlds can emerge from a dynamical process for network evolution. Our

scattering modeling of seismic wave propagation through the aggregate, we
obtain strong constraints on both the size and the elastic constants of iron

measured seismic velocities and attenuations. An iron model is characterized by
its symmetry (cubic or hexagonal), elastic constants, and patch size.
Independent of the crystal symmetry, we infer a most likely size of patch of
the order of 400 m. Recent {\it bcc} iron models from the literature are in
very good agreement with the most probable elastic constants of cubic crystals
found in our inversion. Our study (1) suggests that the presence of melt may
not be required to explain the low shear wavespeeds in the inner core and (2)

"0803.0265","Pierre Moulin","Ying Wang and Pierre Moulin","Blind Fingerprinting","36 pages, submitted for publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study blind fingerprinting, where the host sequence into which
fingerprints are embedded is partially or completely unknown to the decoder.
This problem relates to a multiuser version of the Gel'fand-Pinsker problem.
The number of colluders and the collusion channel are unknown, and the
colluders and the fingerprint embedder are subject to distortion constraints.
  We propose a conditionally constant-composition random binning scheme and a
universal decoding rule and derive the corresponding false-positive and
false-negative error exponents. The encoder is a stacked binning scheme and
makes use of an auxiliary random sequence. The decoder is a {\em maximum
doubly-penalized mutual information decoder}, where the significance of each
candidate coalition is assessed relative to a threshold that trades off
false-positive and false-negative error exponents. The penalty is proportional
to coalition size and is a function of the conditional type of host sequence.
Positive exponents are obtained at all rates below a certain value, which is
therefore a lower bound on public fingerprinting capacity. We conjecture that
this value is the public fingerprinting capacity. A simpler threshold decoder
is also given, which has similar universality properties but also lower
achievable rates. An upper bound on public fingerprinting capacity is also
derived.

superconducting cosmic strings provided by Witten's prototype biscalar field
model can be well represented by an effective Lagrangian of simple logarithmic
form depending on only 3 independent parameters. The numerical work described
here confirms the validity of this approximation, and initiates the evaluation
of the 3 required parameters, as functions of the masses and other parameters
specifying the underlying U(1) x U(1) scalar field model in the limit for which
the relevant gauge coupling constants are small.In this limit, subject to
calibration of the relevant length and mass scales, the scalar field model is
characterised by just 3 dimensionless ratios which (in order to provide
conducting strings) must be subject to three inequalities (of which two have
obvious analytic expressions). It is found here that when all three of these
inequalities are satisfied by a reasonably large margin, there is a simple
empirical formula that can be used to provide a fairly accurate prescription
for the algebraic dependence on these 3 dimensionless ratios of the 3
parameters required for the logarithmic equation of state.

optimal protocol minimizes the mean work spent in a finite-time transition
between two given equilibrium states. For overdamped dynamics which ignores
inertia effects, the optimal protocol has been found to involve jumps of the
control parameter at the beginning and end of the process. Including the
inertia term, we show that this feature not only persists but that even delta
peak-like changes of the control parameter at both boundaries make the process
optimal. These results are obtained by analyzing two simple paradigmatic cases:
First, a Brownian particle dragged by a harmonic optical trap through a viscous
fluid and, second, a Brownian particle subject to an optical trap with
time-dependent stiffness. These insights could be used to improve free energy
calculations via either thermodynamic integration or ""fast growth"" methods
using Jarzynski's equality.

loop are thoroughly investigated. The approach by Gattringer is generalized to
mode sums which reconstruct the Polyakov loop locally. This opens the
possibility to study the mode sum approximation to the Polyakov loop
correlator. The approach is re-derived for the ab initio continuum formulation
of Yang-Mills theories, and the convergence of the mode sum is studied in
detail. The mode sums are then explicitly calculated for the Schwinger model
and SU(2) gauge theory in a homogeneous background field. Using SU(2) lattice
gauge theory, the IR dominated mode sums are considered and the mode sum
approximation to the static quark anti-quark potential is obtained numerically.
We find a good agreement between the mode sum approximation and the static
potential at large distances for the confinement and the high temperature
plasma phase.

and study the problem of wetting near a two-phase critical point without any
assumption on the form of intermolecular potentials. A comparison between
Cahn's method and later works by Sullivan, Evans et al is made. By using an
expression of the energy of interaction between solid surface and liquids
proposed recently by Gouin, we obtain the equations of density profiles and the
boundary conditions on a solid surface. In the case of a convex free energy, a
one-dimensional solution of a linear problem is proposed for the density
profiles between a bulk and on a solid wall. A non-linear model of binary
mixtures extending Cahn's results for simple fluids is also studied. For the
case of a purely attractive wall we have established a criterion of a first
order transition in terms of the structure of the level set of the homogeneous
part of the free energy. Additively, explicit expressions of density profiles
near the wall are proposed. They allow one to consider the adsorption of
mixture components by a solid wall.
