particular: 1) we give shorter versions of Almgren's proofs of the existence of
Dir-minimizing Q-valued functions, of their Hoelder regularity and of the

intrinsic approach to these results, not relying on Almgren's biLipschitz

Dir-minimizing functions by showing that it consists of isolated points.

assume Br(gamma gamma) > 10^{-4}. An upper limit on the total cross section can
also be derived by considering the appearance rates of any Standard Model

detectable. For intermediate dark matter masses, gamma-ray-based and

the gamma-ray limit is stronger for small masses and the neutrino limit is

automatically elevated up to N=(2,2) on CP(N-1) and, at the same time, there
are no N=(0,2) generalizations of the bosonic CP(N-1) model. Edalati and Tong
noted that the target space is in fact CP(N-1) x C rather than CP(N-1). This
allowed them to suggest a ""heterotic"" N=(0,2) sigma model, with the CP(N-1)
target space for bosonic fields and an extra right-handed fermion which couples
to the fermion fields of the N=(2,2) CP(N-1) model. We derive the heterotic
N=(0,2) worldsheet model directly from the bulk theory. The relation between
the bulk and worldsheet deformation parameters we obtain does not coincide with
that suggested by Edalati and Tong at large values of the deformation
parameter. For polynomial deformation superpotentials in the bulk we find
nonpolynomial response in the worldsheet model. We find a geometric
representation for the heterotic model. Supersymmetry is proven to be
spontaneously broken for small deformations (at the quantum level). This
confirms Tong's conjecture. A proof valid for large deformations will be
presented in the subsequent publication.

satisfy probability conservation, to ensure they are always guided to where
they are most needed. In this paper, probability conservation for complexified
Bohmian trajectories is considered. The analysis relies on time-reversal
symmetry considerations, leading to a generalized expression for the
conjugation of wavefunctions of complexified variables. This in turn enables
meaningful discussion of complexified flux continuity, which turns out not to
be satisfied in general, though a related property is found to be true. The
main conclusion, though, is that even under a weak interpretation, probability
is not conserved along complex Bohmian trajectories.

the superconductor fluxtubes and superfluid vortices should be strongly coupled
and hence the vortices should be pinned to the proton-electron plasma in the
core. We explore the effect of this pinning on the hydromagnetic waves in the
core, and discuss 2 astrophysical applications of our results: 1. We show that
even in the case of strong pinning, the core Alfven waves thought to be
responsible for the low-frequency magnetar quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)
are not significantly mass-loaded by the neutrons. The decoupling of about 0.95
of the core mass from the Alfven waves is in fact required in order to explain
the QPO frequencies, for simple magnetic geometries and for magnetic fields not
greater than 10^{15} Gauss. 2. We show that in the case of strong vortex
pinning, hydromagnetic stresses exert stabilizing influence on the Glaberson
instability, which has recently been proposed as a potential source of
superfluid turbulence in neutron stars.

of the Hodge correlators include classical and elliptic polylogarithms, and
their generalizations. The simplest Hodge correlators on the modular curves are
the Rankin-Selberg integrals. Examples of the motivic correlators include
Beilinson's elements in the motivic cohomology, e.g. the ones delivering the
Beilinson - Kato Euler system on modular curves.

car park with $m$ spaces. Each driver goes to the chosen space and parks there

parking function. In general, if $k$ drivers fail to park, we have a

also found that the observed scatter in the Index-Sigma0 relations can be
partially explained by the rotationally-supported nature of these systems.
Indeed, even tighter correlations exist between the line indices and the

dynamical mass is the physical property driving these correlations, and for S0

new ingredient there was a simple but accurate model of the singular source
term based on a discrete representation of the Dirac-delta function and its

circular, equatorial geodesic orbits as a testbed. Such a source is effectively
static, in that the smaller body remains at the same coordinate radius and
orbital inclination over an orbit. (It of course moves through axial angle, but
we separate that degree of freedom from the problem. Our numerical grid has
only radial, polar, and time coordinates.) We now extend the time-domain code
so that it can accommodate dynamic sources that move on a variety of physically
interesting world lines. We validate the code with extensive comparison to
frequency-domain waveforms for cases in which the source moves along generic
(inclined and eccentric) bound geodesic orbits. We also demonstrate the ability
of the time-domain code to accommodate sources moving on interesting
non-geodesic worldlines. We do this by computing the waveform produced by a

Eddington, the spectrum switches from the familiar soft state to a hard state
that is well-described by a distended and tenuous advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF). An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach
10^{12} K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their
temperature typically capped at ~10^{9-11} K. The foundational papers predicted
that the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as
later observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest,
however, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the
accretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as
the gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes
in the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a
comparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which
reside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on
average observed to be fainter by a factor of ~100-1000. The natural
explanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy
from its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event
horizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A*, which is immune to
caveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is
especially compelling. These two lines of evidence for event horizons are
impervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.

measure the absorbers' quasar-frame velocity distribution. We examine the
distribution of lines arising in quasar outflows by subtracting model fits to
the contributions from cosmologically intervening absorbers and absorption due
to the quasar host galaxy or cluster environment. We find a substantial number

over-ionization of gas that is nearer the accretion disk. Furthermore, we find
that outflow-absorbers are on average broader and stronger than

from the cluster centre have stronger Balmer lines than inner-field galaxies of
the same luminosity. The magnesium lines are weaker at large radius, while the
iron lines are not correlated with radius. Converting the line strengths into
estimates of stellar age, metallicity and abundance ratios, we find the
gradients are driven by variations in age (>6 sigma significance) and in the
iron abundance Fe/H (~2.7 sigma significance). The light element (Mg, C, N, Ca)
abundances are almost independent of radius. At radius of 0.4-1.3 degree
(~0.3-1.0x the virial radius), dwarf galaxies have ages ~3.8 Gyr on average,
compared to ~6 Gyr near the cluster centre. The outer dwarfs are also ~50% more
iron-enriched, at given luminosity. Our results confirm earlier indications
that the ages of red-sequence galaxies depend on location within clusters, and
in Coma in particular. The exceptionally strong trends found here suggest that

roughly equal masses new theories were proposed to explain their formation. Two
formation scenarios were suggested by Goldreich and collaborators: In the
first, dynamical friction that is generated by a sea of small bodies enables a
transient binary to become bound ($L^2s$ mechanism); in the second, a transient
binary gets bound by an encounter with a third body ($L^3$ mechanism).
  We show that these different binary formation scenarios leave their own
unique signatures in the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde binary
orbits. This signature is due to stable retrograde orbits that exist much
further out in the Hill sphere than prograde orbits. It provides an excellent
opportunity to distinguish between the different binary formation scenarios
observationally.
  We predict that if binary formation proceeded while sub-Hill velocities
prevailed, the vast majority of all comparable mass ratio binaries have
retrograde orbits. This dominance of retrograde binary orbits is a result of
binary formation via the $L^2s$ mechanism, or any other mechanism that
dissipates energy in a smooth and gradual manner. For super-Hill velocities
binary formation proceeds via the $L^3$ mechanism which produces a roughly
equal number of prograde and retrograde binaries. These predictions assume that
subsequent orbital evolution due to dynamical friction and dynamical stirring
of the Kuiper belt did not alter the sense of the binary orbit after formation.

candidates. The existing information on nuclear activity in the V\'eron-Cetty

catalogue of AGN-candidate galaxies has been produced. It contains 89 AGN
candidates and is publicly available on the AMIGA web page
(http://www.iaa.csic.es/AMIGA.html). At most ~ 1.5 % of the galaxies shows a
radio-excess with respect to the radio-FIR correlation, and this fraction even
goes down to less than 0.8 % after rejection of back/foreground sources. We
find that the fraction of FIR colour selected AGN-candidates is ~ 28 % with a
lower limit of ~ 7 %. A comparison with the results from the literature shows
that the AMIGA sample has the lowest ratio of AGN candidates, both globally and
separated into early and late types. Field galaxies as well as poor cluster and
group environments show intermediate values, while the highest rates of AGN
candidates are found in the central parts of clusters and in pair/merger
dominated samples. We conclude that the environment plays a crucial and direct
role in triggering radio nuclear activity and not only via the
density-morphology relation. Isolated, early-type galaxies show a particularly
low level of activity at radio wavelengths hence constituting the most
nurture-free population of luminous early-type galaxies.

explicitly on drag and lift which are determined in a self-consistent way as

size of the computational domain that is needed to obtain the hydrodynamic

waves. The maxima of energy and the travel speed of solitary waves are not
obtained at the highest wave, which has a 120 degree angle at the crest. Under
the assumption of non-existence of secondary bifurcation which is confirmed
numerically, we prove linear instability of solitary waves which are higher
than the wave of maximal energy and lower than the wave of maximal travel
speed. It is also shown that there exist unstable solitary waves approaching
the highest wave. The unstable waves are of large amplitude and therefore this
type of instability can not be captured by the approximate models derived under
small amplitude assumptions. For the proof, we introduce a family of nonlocal
dispersion operators to relate the linear instability problem with the elliptic
nature of solitary waves. A continuity argument with a moving kernel formula is
used to study these dispersion operators to yield the instability criterion.

$O(1/N^2)$ corrections. In contrast to the unmodified theory, large $N$ volume
independence is valid in the deformed theory down to arbitrarily small volumes.
The double trace deformation prevents the spontaneous breaking of center
symmetry which would otherwise disrupt large $N$ volume independence in small
volumes. For small values of $N$, if the theory is formulated on $\R^3 \times
S^1$ with a sufficiently small compactification size $L$, then an analytic
treatment of the non-perturbative dynamics of the deformed theory is possible.
In this regime, we show that the deformed Yang-Mills theory has a mass gap and
exhibits linear confinement. Increasing the circumference $L$ or number of
colors $N$ decreases the separation of scales on which the analytic treatment
relies. However, there are no order parameters which distinguish the small and
large radius regimes. Consequently, for small $N$ the deformed theory provides
a novel example of a locally four-dimensional pure gauge theory in which one
has analytic control over confinement, while for large $N$ it provides a simple
fully reduced model for Yang-Mills theory. The construction is easily
generalized to QCD and other QCD-like theories.

effect of such resonant forcing on systems undergoing a Hopf bifurcation to
spatially homogeneous oscillations. We use an extension of the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation that systematically captures weak forcing functions
with a spectrum consisting of frequencies close to the 1:1-, the 1:2-, and the
1:3-resonance. By slowly modulating the amplitude of the 1:2-forcing component
we render the bifurcation to subharmonic patterns supercritical despite the
quadratic interaction introduced by the 1:3-forcing. Our weakly nonlinear
analysis shows that quite generally the forcing function can be tuned such that
resonant triad interactions with weakly damped modes stabilize subharmonic
patterns comprised of four or five Fourier modes, which are similar to
quasi-patterns with 4-fold and 5-fold rotational symmetry, respectively. Using
direct simulations of the extended complex Ginzburg-Landau equation we confirm
our weakly nonlinear analysis. In simulations domains of different complex
patterns compete with each other on a slow time scale. As expected from energy
arguments, with increasing strength of the triad interaction the more complex
patterns eventually win out against the simpler patterns. We characterize these
ordering dynamics using the spectral entropy of the patterns. For system
parameters reported for experiments on the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction we explicitly show that the forcing parameters can be tuned such that
4-mode patterns are the preferred patterns.

curves of 26 objects well observed for reverberation mapping. Time scales of
variations are estimated by the most common definition of the variability time
scale and the zero-crossing time of the autocorrelation function of the optical
light curves for each source. The measured time scales of variations by the two
methods are consistent with each other. If the typical value of the viscosity
parameter $\alpha \sim 0.1$ is adopted, the measured optical variability time
scales are most close to the thermal time scales of the standard disks. If
$\alpha$ is allowed to range from $\sim 0.03$ to $\sim 0.2$, the measured time
scales are consistent with the thermal time scales of the standard disks. There
is a linear relation between the measured variability time scales and black

expectation of the standard accretion disk models. The time lags measured by
the ZDCF between different bands are on the order of days. The measured time

unobscured type I AGN with little mid-infrared flux contributed by the AGN host
galaxy. Of the remaining Chandra sources, most are lower luminosity type I and

background mean westerlies have great influence on evolution of DB during its

blocking life period shortens, accompanied with the enhanced westerlies. The
shear of the background westerlies also plays an important role in the
evolution of blocking. The cyclonic shear is preferable for the development of
blocking but when the cyclonic shear increases, the intensity of blocking
decreases and the life period of DB becomes shorter. Weak anticyclonic shear
below a critical threshold is also favorable for DB formation. Time-dependent
background westerly (TDW) in the life cycle of DB has some modulations on the
blocking life period and intensity due to the behavior of the mean westerlies.
Statistical analysis regarding the climatological features of observed DB is

extend basic thread algebra with the barest mechanism for sequencing of threads
that are taken for fragments. This mechanism, called poly-threading, supports
both autonomous and non-autonomous thread selection in sequencing. We relate
the resulting theory to the algebraic theory of processes known as ACP and use
it to describe analytic execution architectures suited for fragmented programs.
We also consider the case where the steps of fragmented program behaviours are
interleaved in the ways of non-distributed and distributed multi-threading.

implies that natural selection has exerted no or very little pressure on the
network degree distribution during evolution. The corresponding random network,
here termed the blind watchmaker network has a power-law degree distribution
with an exponent gamma >= 2. It is random with respect to a complete set of
network states characterized by a description of which links are attached to a
node as well as a time-ordering of these links. No a priory assumption of any
growth mechanism or evolution process is made. It is found that the degree
distribution of the blind watchmaker network agrees very precisely with that of
the metabolic networks. This implies that the evolutionary pathway of the
cell-metabolism, when projected onto a metabolic network representation, has
remained statistically random with respect to a complete set of network states.
This suggests that even a biological system, which due to natural selection has
developed an enormous specificity like the cellular metabolism, nevertheless
can, at the same time, display well defined characteristics emanating from the
ubiquitous inherent random element of Darwinian evolution. The fact that also
completely random networks may have scale-free node distributions gives a new
perspective on the origin of scale-free networks in general.

At odds with the projected stellar velocity dispersion radial profile, the

most metal-rich (ie. [Fe/H]-rich) stars are partly segregated. This naturally
results in two different stellar populations, with an anti-correlation between

bill or an amendment, is pitted against the status quo. A simple game or a
yes-no voting system is a set of rules that specifies exactly which collections
of ``yea'' votes yield passage of the issue at hand. A collection of ``yea''
voters forms a winning coalition.
  We are interested on performing a complexity analysis of problems on such
games depending on the game representation. We consider four natural explicit
representations, winning, loosing, minimal winning, and maximal loosing. We
first analyze the computational complexity of obtaining a particular
representation of a simple game from a different one. We show that some cases
this transformation can be done in polynomial time while the others require
exponential time. The second question is classifying the complexity for testing
whether a game is simple or weighted. We show that for the four types of
representation both problem can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we
provide results on the complexity of testing whether a simple game or a
weighted game is of a special type. In this way, we analyze strongness,
properness, decisiveness and homogeneity, which are desirable properties to be
fulfilled for a simple game.

with strong meson-nucleon coupling at one vertex and weak parity-violating

  We selected star-forming galaxies at z=0 and at z=0.7 in IR and in UV to have
access to all the recent star formation. We focused on galaxies with a stellar
mass ranging between 10^{10} and 10^{11} M_sun for which the results are not
biased by the selections. We compared the data to chemical evolution models
developed for spiral galaxies and originally built to reproduce the main
characteristics of the Milky Way and nearby spirals without fine-tuning them
for the present analysis. We find a shallow decrease in the specific star
formation rate (SSFR) when the stellar mass increases. The evolution of the
SSFR characterizing both UV and IR selected galaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 is
consistent with the models built to reproduce the present spiral galaxies.
There is no need to strongly modify of the physical conditions in galaxies to
explain the average evolution of their star formation from z=0 to z=0.7. We use
the models to predict the evolution of the star formation rate and the
metallicity on a wider range of redshift and we compare these predictions with

fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes
from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating
quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to
Heidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.
  Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent
to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is
attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other
theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this
paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow
$\breve{A}_\phi:\Si_\phi\map\R_\phi$ where $\Si_\phi$ and $\R_\phi$ are two
special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the
appropriate topos, $\tau_\phi$.
  We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system,
$S$. The first, $\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\L{S}$, is
a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with
an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of $\PL{S}$ we expand and develop some of
the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum
physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection
operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf $\Sig$--the topos
quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is $\SetH{}$:
the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially
ordered set) $\V{}$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded
operators on the quantum Hilbert space $\Hi$.

have described the observations and discussed some dynamical aspects of the
earlier phases of the flare, as well as the helium line formation in the active
region prior to the event. Here we extend the analysis of the helium line
formation to the later phases of the flare in two different locations of the
flaring area. We have devised a new technique, exploiting all available
information from various SOHO instruments, to determine the spectral
distribution of the photoionizing EUV radiation produced by the corona
overlying the two target regions. In order to find semiempirical models
matching all of our observables, we analyzed the effect on the calculated
helium spectrum both of A(He) (the He abundance) and of the uncertainties in
the incident EUV radiation (level and spectral distribution). We found that the
abundance has in most cases (but not in all) a larger effect than the coronal
back-radiation. The result of our analysis is that, considering the error of
the measured lines, and adopting our best estimate for the coronal EUV
illumination, the value A(He)=0.075 +/- 0.010 in the chromosphere (for T>6300
K) and transition region yields reasonably good matches for all the observed
lines. This value is marginally consistent with the most commonly accepted
photospheric value: A(He)=0.085.

interstellar medium (ISM) of NGC 2768; the dust, molecular gas, ionised gas and
neutral hydrogen (HI) trace the recent acquisition of cold and cool gas over
two orders of magnitude in radii (and much more in density). In agreement with
the other ISM components, the CO distribution extends nearly perpendicularly to
the photometric major axis of the galaxy. Velocity maps of the CO show a
rotating polar disc or ring in the inner kiloparsec. This cool gas could lead
to kinematic substructure formation within NGC 2768. However, the stellar
velocity field and H-beta absorption linestrength maps from the optical
integral-field spectrograph SAURON give no indication of a young and
dynamically cold stellar population coincident with the molecular polar disc.
Very recent or weak star formation, undetectable in linestrengths, nevertheless
remains a possibility and could be at the origin of some of the ionised gas
observed. Millimetre continuum emission was also detected in NGC 2768, now one
of only a few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with observed millimetre
continuum emission.

high-resolution spectroscopy is used to study the nebular dynamics both along
the line of sight and in the plane of the sky. These observations allow us to
construct a 3-D spatio-kinematical model of the nebula, which together with the
measurement of its apparent expansion in the plane of the sky over a period of
4 years, provides the expansion parallax for the nebula. The integral field
data featuring the [S{\sc ii}] $\lambda\lambda$671.7,673.1 emission line

together with the distance estimation allow us to estimate its ionized mass. We
find densities ranging from n$_e$=500 to 1000 cm$^{-3}$ in the inner lobes and
from 300 to 500cm$^{-3}$ in the outer lobes. We determine an expansion parallax
distance of 3.3$\pm$0.9 kpc to Hen 2-104, implying an unexpectedly large
ionized mass for the nebula of the order of one tenth of a solar mass.

circuitry is an important problem in neuroscience. Recent developments in
electrophysiology and imaging allow one to simultaneously record activities of
hundreds of neurons. Inferring the underlying neuronal connectivity patterns
from such multi-neuronal spike train data streams is a challenging statistical
and computational problem. This task involves finding significant temporal
patterns from vast amounts of symbolic time series data. In this paper we show
that the frequent episode mining methods from the field of temporal data mining
can be very useful in this context. In the frequent episode discovery
framework, the data is viewed as a sequence of events, each of which is
characterized by an event type and its time of occurrence and episodes are
certain types of temporal patterns in such data. Here we show that, using the
set of discovered frequent episodes from multi-neuronal data, one can infer
different types of connectivity patterns in the neural system that generated
it. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of mining for frequent episodes
under certain temporal constraints; the structure of these temporal constraints
is motivated by the application. We present algorithms for discovering serial
and parallel episodes under these temporal constraints. Through extensive
simulation studies we demonstrate that these methods are useful for unearthing
patterns of neuronal network connectivity.

the oldest galaxies having ages of ~10 Gyr old. This average age is identical

dispersion but are consistent with being drawn from a population with a single
age. Specifically, ten of the twelve ETGs are consistent within their formal
errors of having the same age, 5.2+/-0.2 Gyr, over a factor of more than 750 in

photometric and spectroscopic observations of 36 strong gravitational lenses.
The lensing allows a direct determination of the mass-surface density and so
avoids the usual dependence on mass-to-light ratio. We consider this same
sample in the context of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and demonstrate
that the observed mass-based fundamental plane coincides with the MOND
fundamental plane determined previously for a set of high-order polytropic
spheres chosen to match the observed range of effective radii and velocity
dispersions in elliptical galaxies. Moreover, the observed projected mass
within one-half an effective radius is consistent with the mass in visible
stars plus a small additional component of ``phantom dark matter'' resulting
from the MOND contribution to photon deflection.

thickness (t_F), and substrate induced strain (epsilon) on morphological,
crystallographic and magnetic characteristics of equiatomic CoPt epitaxial
films synthesized with PLD are investigated. The (001) substrates of MgO, STO
and LAO provide different degree of epitaxial strain for growth of the
disordered face centered cubic (fcc) and ordered face centered tetragonal
(L1_0) phases of CoPt. The films deposited at T_d~600 ^0C on all three
substrates are fcc with in-plane magnetization and a narrow hysteresis loop of
width~200 Oe. The L1_0 phase, stabilized only at T_d~700 ^0C becomes
predominantly c-axis oriented as T_d is increased to 800 ^0C. While the
crystallographic structure of the films depends solely on the T_d, their
microstructure and magnetization characteristics are decided by the growth
rate. At the higher G_r (~1A/sec) the L1_0 films have a maze-like structure
which converts to a continuous film as the t_F is increased from 20 to 50 nm.
The H_c of these films increases as the L1_0 phase fraction grows with T_d and
its orientation becomes out of the film plane. The evolution of microstructure
with T_d is remarkably different at lower growth rate (~0.4A /sec). Here the
structure changes from a self-similar fractal pattern to an assembly of
nano-dots as the T_d is raised from 700 to 800 ^0C, and is understood in terms
of the imbalance between strain and interfacial energies. MFM of such films
reveals no distinct domain walls within the nano-islands while a clear contrast
is seen between the islands of reversed magnetization. The simple picture of
coherent rotation of moment appears incompatible with the time dependence of
the remanent magnetization in these films.

  20th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2009)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  From a high volume stream of weighted items, we want to maintain a generic
sample of a certain limited size $k$ that we can later use to estimate the
total weight of arbitrary subsets. This is the classic context of on-line
reservoir sampling, thinking of the generic sample as a reservoir. We present
an efficient reservoir sampling scheme, $\varoptk$, that dominates all previous
schemes in terms of estimation quality.
  $\varoptk$ provides {\em variance optimal unbiased estimation of subset
sums}. More precisely, if we have seen $n$ items of the stream, then for {\em
any} subset size $m$, our scheme based on $k$ samples minimizes the average
variance over all subsets of size $m$. In fact, the optimality is against any
off-line scheme with $k$ samples tailored for the concrete set of items seen.
In addition to optimal average variance, our scheme provides tighter worst-case
bounds on the variance of {\em particular} subsets than previously possible. It
is efficient, handling each new item of the stream in $O(\log k)$ time.
Finally, it is particularly well suited for combination of samples from
different streams in a distributed setting.

time dependences of each physical variable are in separable form. Axisymmetric
toroidal MHD plasma configuration is solved under the gravitational field of a
central star of mass $M$. With an azimuthal magnetic field, this self-similar
MHD model provides an equatorial structure in the form of an axisymmetric torus
with nested and closed toroidal magnetic field lines. In the absence of an
azimuthal magnetic field, this formulation models the basic features of bipolar
planetary nebulae. The evolution function, which accounts for the time
evolution of the system, has a bounded and an unbounded evolution track
governed respectively by a negative and positive energy density constant $H$.

mid-IR identified submillimetre galaxies discovered via the SHADES 850 micron
SCUBA imaging in the Subaru-XMM Deep Field (SXDF). Optical data for the sources
comes from the Subaru-XMM Deep Field (SXDF) and mid- and far-IR fluxes from
SWIRE. We obtain photometric redshift estimates for our sources using optical
and IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron fluxes. We then fit spectral energy distribution
(SED) templates to the longer wavelength data to determine the nature of the
far-IR emission that dominates the bolometric luminosity of these sources. The
infrared template fits are also used to resolve ambiguous identifications and
cases of redshift aliasing. The redshift distribution obtained broadly matches
previous results for submm sources and on the SHADES SXDF field. Our template
fitting finds that AGN, present in about 10% of sources, do not contribute
significantly to their bolometric luminosity. Dust heating by starbursts, with
either Arp220 or M82 type SEDs, appears to be responsible for the luminosity in
most sources (23/33 are fitted by Arp220 templates, 2/33 by the warmer M82
templates). 8/33 sources, in contrast, are fit by a cooler cirrus dust
template, suggesting that cold dust has a role in some of these highly luminous
objects. Three of our sources appear to have multiple identifications or
components at the same redshift, but we find no statistical evidence that close
associations are common among our SHADES sources. Examination of rest-frame K
-band luminosity suggests that 'downsizing' is underway in the submm galaxy
population, with lower redshift systems lying in lower mass host galaxies. Of
our 33 identifications six are found to be of lower reliability but their
exclusion would not significantly alter our conclusions.
