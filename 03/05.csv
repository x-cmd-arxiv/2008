the nearby galaxy NGC 6946. Surprisingly, it was not found in deep,
pre-explosion optical images of its host galaxy taken with the Large Binocular
Telescope, but only through examination of archival Spitzer mid-IR data. A
source coincident with the SN 2008S position is clearly detected in the 4.5,
5.8, and 8.0 micron IRAC bands, showing no evident variability in the three
years prior to the explosion, yet is undetected at 3.6 and 24 micron. The
distinct presence of ~440 K dust, along with stringent LBT limits on the
optical fluxes, suggests that the progenitor of SN 2008S was engulfed in a
shroud of its own dust. The inferred luminosity of 3.5x10^4 Lsun implies a
modest mass of ~10 Msun. We conclude that objects like SN 2008S are not
exclusively associated with the deaths or outbursts of very massive eta
Carinae-like objects. This conclusion holds based solely on the optical flux
limits even if our identification of the progenitor with the mid-IR source is
incorrect.

measured by number as the specific frequency, is a fundamental quantity that
reflects both a galaxy's early star formation and its entire merging history.
We present specific frequencies, luminosities, and mass fractions for the
globular cluster systems of 100 early-type galaxies in the ACS Virgo Cluster
Survey, the largest homogeneous catalog of its kind. We find that 1) GC mass
fractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low in
galaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) The behavior of specific frequency
across galaxy mass is dominated by the blue GCs. 3) The GC fractions of
low-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. Nearly all dwarf
galaxies with high GC fractions are within 1 Mpc of the cD galaxy M87,
presenting the first strong evidence that GC formation in dwarfs is biased
toward dense environments. 4) GC formation in central dwarfs is biased because
their stars form earliest and most intensely. Comparisons to the Millennium
Simulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and form
more stars at higher star formation rates (SFRs) and SFR surface densities. The
SFR surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total SFR, naturally
producing GC populations that are older and more metal-poor than the field
stars. 5) Dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals M87 and M49 are red
and have few or no GCs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped and
have contributed their GCs to the halos of their giant neighbors. The central
dwarfs with high GC mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors most
similar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich M87 globular cluster
system.(Abridged)

ionizations and excitations with H and He and for electron-electron collisions.
We precisely derive the fraction of the primary electron energy that heats the
gas, ionizes atoms and produces line and continuum photons as a function of the
ionization fraction. Handy fitting formulae for all the above energy
depositions are provided. By keeping track of the individual photons we can
distinguish between photons in the Ly-alpha resonance and those with energy E <
10.2 eV that do not interact further with gas. This separation is important
because a Ly-alpha background can heat or cool the gas depending on the nature
of the photons, and can have effects on the 21 cm radiation emitted by neutral
H, which will probably become detectable at z > 6 in the near future by the
next generation radio interferometers.

have performed spectroscopic observations of new bright quasar candidates
selected from various methods based on optical colors, near-infrared colors,
radio, and X-ray data. In 2005/2006, we observed 55 bright quasar candidates
using the Bohyunsan Optical Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) on the 1.8 m telescope
at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory in Korea. We identify 14
quasars/Seyferts from our observation, including an optically bright quasar
with i=14.98 mag at z=0.092 (SDSS J003236.59-091026.2). Non-quasar/Seyfert
objects are found to be mostly stars, among which there are five M-type stars
and one cataclysmic variable. Our result shows that there still exist bright
quasars to be discovered. However, at the same time, we conclude that finding
new bright quasars in high Galactic latitude regions is very challenging and

humans unique in developing such extensive communication abilities. To treat
this problem, a method based on the mutual information approach is developed
that evaluates the information content of communication between interacting
individuals through correlations of their behavior patterns (rather than
calculating the information load of exchanged discrete signals, e.g. Shannon
entropy). It predicts that correlated interactions of the indirect reciprocity
type together with affective behavior and selection rules changing with time

Population size variations accelerate this development. These results are
supported by evidence of demographic bottlenecks, distinguishing human from

colossal positive and negative thermal expansion in Ag$_3$[Co(CN)$_6]$. The
results confirm that the positive expansion within the trigonal basal plane and
the negative expansion in the orthogonal direction are coupled due to the
existence of a network defined by nearly-rigid bonds within the chains of
Co--C--N--Ag--N--C--Co linkages. The origin of the colossal values of the
coefficients of thermal expansion arise from an extremely shallow energy
surface that allows a flexing of the structure with small energy cost. The
thermal expansion can be achieved with a modest value of the overall
Gr\""{u}neisen parameter. The energy surface is so shallow that we need to
incorporate a small empirical dispersive interaction to give ground-state
lattice parameters that match experimental values at low temperature. We
compare the results with DFT calculations on two isostructural systems:
H$_3$[Co(CN)$_6$], which is known to have much smaller values of the
coefficients of thermal expansion, and Au$_3$[Co(CN)$_6$], which has not yet
been synthesised but which is predicted by our calculations to be another
candidate material for showing colossal positive and negative thermal
expansion.

Collective Mode (GCM) analysis scheme, we show that the positive dispersion of
the sound velocity occurs in a wavelength region below the crossover from
hydrodynamic to atom-type excitations and, therefore, it can not be explained
as sound propagation over the light specie (Na) network. The present result
experimentally proves the existence of positive dispersion in a binary mixture
due to a relaxation process, as opposed to fast sound phenomena.

the neutrino wavepacket produced by charged particles under various
circumstances: in an interaction-free environment, in a radiation-dominated
medium (typical of the sources of the gamma ray bursts) and in the presence of
a magnetic field. The effect of the magnetic field on the wavepacket size
appears to be more important than the scattering. If the magnetic field at the
source is larger than $\sim$10 Gauss, the coherence of neutrinos will be lost
while traveling over cosmological distances. Various applications of these
results have been considered. We find that for large magnetic fields ($B> 10^9$
Gauss) and high energies ($E_\nu>{\rm PeV}$), ""coherent broadening"" can modify
the energy spectrum of neutrinos. In the coherent case, averaging out the
oscillatory terms of the probabilities does not induce any statistical
uncertainty beyond what expected in the absence of these terms. A deviation
from the standard quantum mechanics that preserves average energy and unitarity

X-ray spectral state in black hole binaries is that the geometrically thin disc
recedes back from the last stable orbit at the transition to this state. This
has recently been challenged by direct observations of the low/hard state disc
from CCD data. We reanalyze the Swift and RXTE campaign covering the 2006
outburst of XTE J1817-330 and show that these data actually strongly support
the truncated disc model as the transition spectra unambiguously show that the
disc begins to recede as the source leaves the disc dominated soft state. The
disc radius inferred for the proper low/hard state is less clear-cut, but we
show that the effect of irradiation from the energetically dominant hot plasma
leads to an underestimate of the disc radius by a factor of 2-3 in this state.
This may also produce the soft excess reported in some hard-state spectra. The
inferred radius becomes still larger when the potential difference in stress at
the inner boundary, increased colour temperature correction from incomplete
thermalization of the irradiation, and loss of observable disc photons from
Comptonization in the hot plasma are taken into account. We conclude that the
inner disc radius in XTE J1817-330 in the low/hard spectral state is at least
6-8 times that seen in the disc dominated high/soft state, and that recession
of the inner disc is the trigger for the soft--hard state transition, as
predicted by the truncated disc models.

very rich morphological details, composed mainly of UV scattered light and of
Halpha emission. Contrasting with the bright parts of the nebula, opaque,
elongated patches are seen. Our optical photometry confirms that the
illuminator of the nebula is likely to be a B0.5V star located at a distance of
about 3.2 kpc. Our near-IR images reveal an embedded cluster, extending for
about 2 pc and exhibiting sub-clustering: a denser, more condensed, sub-cluster
surrounding the optical high-mass B0.5V illuminator star; and a more embedded,
optically invisible, sub-cluster located towards the eastern, dark part of the
nebula and including the luminous MSX source G224.1880+01.2407, a massive
protostellar candidate that could be the origin of jets and extended features
seen at 2.12 micron. The double cluster appears to be clearing the remaining
molecular material of the parent cloud, creating patches of lower extinction
and allowing some of the least reddened members to be detected in the optical
images. We find 12 MS and 143 PMS members using 3 different methods: comparison
with isochrones in optical colour-magnitude diagrams, detection of near-IR
excess, and presence of Halpha emission. The most massive star fits a 4 Myr
post-MS isochrone. The age of the optically selected PMS population is
estimated to be 7-8 Myr. The IR-excess population shows sub-clustering on
scales as small as 0.23 pc and is probably much younger.

several collapse periods the output chemistry of infall tracer species such as
HCO+, CS, and N2H+, is then coupled to an accelerated Lambda-iteration

In general, models with a warm central region show higher values of blue

temperature profile. We find that in the formal context of Shu-type inside-out
infall, and in the absence of rotation or outflows, the relative blue asymmetry
of certain HCO+ and CS transitions is a function of time and, subject to the

face the need for parsimony in the modeling of high-order Markov chains in

effect of each lag upon the present is considered separately and additively, so
that the number of parameters required is drastically reduced. However, the
efficiency for the MTD parameter estimations proposed up to date still remains
problematic on account of the large number of constraints on the parameters. In
this paper, an iterative procedure, commonly known as Expectation-Maximization

Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate the MTD parameters. Some applications
of modeling MTD show the proposed EM algorithm is easier to be used than the
algorithm developed by Berchtold. Moreover, the EM Estimations of parameters
for high-order MTD models led on DNA sequences outperform the corresponding

challenges concerning the Ap/Bp stars is to understand the origin of their slow
rotation and their magnetic fields. The favoured hypothesis for the latter is
that the fields are fosils, which implies that the magnetic fields subsist
throughout the different evolutionary phases, and in particular during the

QCD$_{2}$ and the relevance of the $sl(2)$ ATM model in order to describe the
confinement of the color degrees of freedom. We have shown that QCD$_{2}$ has
quark soliton solutions if the quark mass is sufficiently large.

is implemented for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and its phenomenological
consequences investigated. The central idea of the method is to avoid the
critical step involved in the regularization process, namely the explicit
evaluation of divergent integrals. This goal is achieved by assuming a
regularization distribution in an implicit way and making use, in intermediary
steps, only of very general properties of such regularization. The finite parts
are separated of the divergent ones and integrated free from effects of the
regularization. The divergent parts are organized in terms of standard objects
which are independent of the (arbitrary) momenta running in internal lines of
loop graphs. Through the analysis of symmetry relations, a set of properties
for the divergent objects are identified, which we denominate consistency
relations, reducing the number of divergent objects to only a few ones. The
calculational strategy eliminates unphysical dependencies of the arbitrary
choices for the routing of internal momenta, leading to ambiguity-free, and
symmetry-preserving physical amplitudes. We show that the imposition of scale
properties for the basic divergent objects leads to a critical condition for
the constituent quark mass such that the remaining arbitrariness is removed.
The model become predictive in the sense that its phenomenological consequences
do not depend on possible choices made in intermediary steps. Numerical results
are obtained for physical quantities at the one-loop level for the pion and
sigma masses and pion-quark and sigma-quark coupling constants.

steep stellar mass-functions while clusters with low concentration have
comparatively shallow mass-functions. No globular clusters were found with a

concentrated star clusters are believed to be dynamically more evolved and
should have lost more low-mass stars via evaporation, which would result in a
shallower mass-function in the low-mass part.
  We show that this effect can be explained by residual-gas expulsion from

~2 mergers from z~2 up to present day, reflecting the late assembly time for

suggest that GCs in dIrrs are kinematically young and not fully relaxed yet.
The present-day specific frequencies (SN) span a broad range: 0.3 < SN < 11.
Assuming a dissipationless age fading of the galaxy light, the SN values would

nearby ringed Sab galaxy NGC 4736. High sensitivity radio polarimetric data
obtained with the VLA at 8.46GHz and 4.86GHz show a distinct ring of total
radio emission precisely corresponding to the bright inner pseudoring visible
in other wavelengths. However, unlike the total radio emission, the polarized
radio emission reveals a clear pattern of ordered magnetic field of spiral
shape, emerging from the galactic centre. The magnetic vectors do not follow
the tightly-wrapped spiral arms that characterize the inner pseudoring, but
instead cross the ring with a constant and large pitch angle of about 35deg.
The ordered field is thus not local adjusted to the pattern of star-formation
activity, unlike what is usually observed in grand-design spirals. The observed
asymmetric distribution of Faraday rotation suggests the possible action of a
large-scale MHD dynamo. The strong magnetic total and regular field within the
ring (up to 30microG and 13microG, respectively) indicates that a highly
efficient process of magnetic field amplification is under way, probably
related to secular evolutionary processes in the galaxy.

successfully described with a gravitational model consisting of a thin

variable radial mass density. The governing integral equation is based on
mechanical balance between Newtonian gravitational and centrifugal forces (due
to galaxy rotation) at each and every point in a finite set of concentric

parameter we call ``galactic rotation parameter'' which concisely crystallizes
perspective. Computational solutions are obtained for the radial mass
distributions that satisfy the measured rotational velocity profiles. Together
with a constraint equation for mass conservation, the galactic rotational
parameter is also determined from which the total galactic mass is calculated
from measured galactic radii and maximum rotation velocities. These calculated
total galactic masses are in good agreement with data. Our deduced
exponentially decreasing mass distributions in the central galactic core are in
agreement with almost all others. However our mass distributions differ toward
the galactic periphery with more ordinary baryonic mass in these outer disk
regions which are cooler with lower opactiy/emissivity (and thus darker).

conclude that both are likely background stars. The overall multiplicity

deformations leads to a holographic derivation of the conformal anomaly, and
its conformal primitive, associated to the whole family of conformally
covariant powers of the Laplacian (GJMS operators) at the conformal boundary.
The bulk side involves a quantum 1-loop correction to the SUGRA action and the
boundary counterpart accounts for a sub-leading term in the large-N limit. The
sequence of GJMS conformal Laplacians shows up in the two-point function of the
CFT operator dual to a bulk scalar field at certain values of its scaling
dimension. The restriction to conformally flat boundary metrics reduces the
bulk computation to that of volume renormalization which renders the universal
type A anomaly. In this way, we directly connect two chief roles of the
Q-curvature: the main term in Polyakov formulas on one hand, and its relation
to the Poincare metrics of the Fefferman-Graham construction, on the other
hand. We find agreement with previously conjectured patterns including a
generic and simple formula for the type A anomaly coefficient that matches all
reported values in the literature concerning GJMS operators, to our knowledge.

small, eccentric satellite that orbits within a narrow gap in a broad,
self-gravitating planetary ring. These equations show that the satellite's
secular perturbations of the ring will excite a very long-wavelength spiral
density wave that propagates away from the gap's outer edge. The amplitude of
these waves, as well as their dispersion relation, are derived here. That
dispersion relation reveals that a planetary ring can sustain two types of
density waves: long waves that, in Saturn's A ring, would have wavelengths of
order 100 km, and short waves that tend to be very nonlinear and are expected
to quickly damp. The excitation of these waves also transports angular momentum
from the ring to the satellite in a way that damps the satellite's eccentricity
e, which also tends to reduce the amplitude of subsequent waves. The rate of
eccentricity damping due to this wave action is then compared to the rates at
which the satellite's Lindblad and corotation resonances alter the satellite's
e. These results are then applied to the gap-embedded Saturnian satellites Pan
and Daphnis, and the long-term stability of their eccentricities is assessed.

peak temperature and luminosity which vary together in such a way as to
indicate an approximately constant emitting area. The association of this with
the last stable orbit gives one of the few ways to estimate spin when the mass
of the black hole is known. However, deriving this radius requires knowledge of
how the disk spectrum is modified by radiative transfer through the vertical
structure of the disk, as well as special and general relativistic effects on
the propagation of this radiation. Here we investigate the extent to which
differences in vertical structure change the derived disk spectra by
calculating these for a range of different stress prescriptions. We find that
at a given mass accretion rate the spectra are almost identical for accretion
rates of L/L_Edd <~ 0.1. The spectra are remarkably similar even up to the
highest luminosities considered (L/L_Edd ~ 0.6) as long as the stresses do not
dissipate more than about 10 per cent of the gravitational energy above the
effective photosphere. This is exceeded only by classic alpha disks with alpha
>~ 0.1, but these models give spectral variation which is incompatible with
existing data. Therefore, we conclude that disk spectral modelling can place
interesting constraints on angular momentum transport, but still provide a
robust estimate of the spin of the black hole.

emission: two compact warm objects (SMA1 and SMA2) along the periphery of the

inside the shell, supporting the picture of a dust-free cavity surrounded by
high density gas. At subarcsecond resolution, most of the molecular gas tracers

fully in the tensor-optimized shell model, where the variation of the size
parameters of the single particle orbits is essential for getting strong tensor

tensor and pairing correlations in 9Li are Pauli-blocked by additional valence
neutrons, which make the p-shell configurations pushed up in energy. As a
result, the $s^2$ valence neutron component increases to reveal the halo
structure of 11Li and the inversion phenomenon of the single particle spectrum
in 10Li arises. Following the previous study, we demonstrate the reliability of
our framework by performing a detailed systematic analysis of the structures of

neutrons of 11Li and the electromagnetic properties of Li isotopes. The
detailed effects of the Pauli-blocking on the spectroscopic properties of

for the 11Li ground state rather than for 10Li and for the dipole excited
states of 11Li, which is mainly caused by the interplay between the tensor
correlation in 9Li and the halo neutrons. The results obtained in these
analyses clearly show that the inert core assumption of 9Li is not realistic to

spreading, which are widely used to represent fast fading multipath
communication channels. The concept of approximate eigenstructure is
introduced, which measures the accuracy E_p of the approximation of the channel
operation as a pure multiplication in a given L_p-norm. Two variants of such an
approximate Weyl symbol calculus are studied, which have important applications
in several models for time--varying mobile channels. Typically, such channels
have random spreading functions (inverse Weyl transform) defined on a common
support U of finite non--zero size such that approximate eigenstructure has to
be measured with respect to certain norms of the spreading process. We derive
several explicit relations to the size |U| of the support. We show that the
characterization of the ratio of E_p to some L_q-norm of the spreading function
is related to weighted norms of ambiguity and Wigner functions. We present the
connection to localization operators and give new bounds on the ability of
localization of ambiguity functions and Wigner functions in U. Our analysis

electron energy (Landau energy) neglecting the Coulomb interactions between
electrons, classical Coulomb energy and the quantum energy via quantum
transitions. Herein, the sum of the Landau energy and the classical Coulomb
energy depends upon the value of the filling factor continuously. However, the
quantum transition energy discontinuously depends upon the value of the filling
factor. This discontinuity yields energy gaps in many stable FQH states. The
energy gaps for specific filling factors produce the precise confinement of
Hall resistance.
  A new experiment is considered as follows; the magnetic strength is fixed to
the value to confine the Hall resistance at the filling factor of 2/3 as an
example. Moreover the magnetic modulation with frequency f is applied to the
system. The frequency dependence of the diagonal resistance is measured. Then,
it is shown in this paper that the diagonal resistance varies drastically at
some frequency value f0. We clarify the following relation between this value
f0 and the magnetic strength width dB of Hall plateaus as f0 = e dB / (4 Pi m),

best use of this advantage, modeling the NXB spectra with high accuracy is
important to subtract them from the spectra of on-source observations. We
construct an NXB database by collecting XIS events when the dark Earth covers
the XIS FOV. The total exposure time of the NXB data is about 785 ks for each
XIS. It is found that the count rate of the NXB anti-correlates with the
cut-off-rigidity and correlates with the count rate of the PIN upper
discriminator (PIN-UD) in Hard X-ray Detector on board Suzaku. We thus model
the NXB spectrum for a given on-source observation by employing either of these
parameters and obtain a better reproducibility of the NXB for the model with
PIN-UD than that with the cut-off-rigidity. The reproducibility of the NXB
model with PIN-UD is 4.55-5.63% for each XIS NXB in the 1-7 keV band and

the coupling of the effective interaction. The temperature at which \Delta_tq

quantum criticality only when N >> 1. For the physical case N = 2, the usual

redundancy spread over individually unreliable nodes. Application scenarios
include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless
networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes,
requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of
reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes
fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way
while transferring as little data as possible across the network.
  For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a node failure
is for a new node to download subsets of data stored at a number of surviving
nodes, reconstruct a lost coded block using the downloaded data, and store it
at the new node. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the
notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to download
\emph{functions} of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that
regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we
show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth
which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately
constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we
introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal
tradeoff.

'weigh' the black holes of a sample of z~2 SMGs with broad Halpha or Hbeta
emission. The average black-hole mass and Eddington ratio (eta) of the
lower-luminosity broad-line SMGs (L_X~10^44 erg/s} are log(M_BH/M_sol)~8.0 and
eta~0.2, respectively. These lower-luminosity broad-line SMGs lie in the same
location of the L_X-L_FIR plane as more typical SMGs hosting X-ray obscured AGN
and may be intrinsically similar systems, but orientated so that the rest-frame
optical nucleus is visible. Under this hypothesis, we conclude that SMGs host
black holes with log(M_BH/M_odot)~7.8; we find supporting evidence from
observations of local ULIRGs. Combining these black-hole mass constraints with
measured host-galaxy masses, we find that the black holes in SMGs are >3 times
smaller than those found in comparably massive normal galaxies in the local
Universe, albeit with considerable uncertainty, and >10 times smaller than
those predicted for z~2 luminous quasars and radio galaxies. These results
imply that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in SMGs,
in stark contrast with that previously suggested for radio galaxies and
luminous quasars at z~2. On the basis of current host-galaxy mass constraints,
we show that SMGs and their descendants cannot lie significantly above the
locally defined M_BH-M_GAL relationship. We argue that the black holes in the
z~0 descendents of SMGs will have log(M_BH/M_odot)~8.6, indicating that they
only need to grow by a factor of ~6 by the present day (ABRIDGED).

  Connectivity and Applications to Genetic Switches","To appear in Advances in Complex Systems",,,,"q-bio.MN math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-continuous dynamical systems defined on graphs are often used to model
complex systems with many interacting components in a non-spatial context. In
the reverse sense attaching meaningful dynamics to given 'interaction diagrams'
is a central bottleneck problem in many application areas, especially in cell
biology where various such diagrams with different conventions describing
molecular regulation are presently in use. In most situations these diagrams
can only be interpreted by the use of both discrete and continuous variables
during the modelling process, corresponding to both deterministic and
stochastic hybrid dynamics. The conventions in genetics are well-known, and
therefore we use this field for illustration purposes. In [25] and [26] the
authors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems
with both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by
dynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains. The leading order
term in these dynamical systems is called average dynamics and turns out to be
an adequate concept to analyse a class of simplified hybrid systems. Once the
dynamics is defifined the mutual interaction of both ODEs and Markov chains can
be analysed through the (reverse) introduction of the so called Interaction
Graph, a concept originally invented for time-continuous dynamical systems, see
[5]. Here we transfer this graph concept to the average dynamics, which itself
is introduced as an heuristic tool to construct models of reaction or contact
networks. The graphical concepts introduced form the basis for any subsequent
study of the qualitative properties of hybrid models in terms of connectivity
and (feedback) loop formation.

is intrinsically luminous (L_X~3x10^44 erg/s) but heavily absorbed by
Compton-thick material (N_H>>10^24 cm^{-2}); i.e., this object is a
Compton-thick quasar. Adopting the same approach that we applied to HDF-oMD49,
we found a further six objects at z~2-2.5 in the literature that are also X-ray
weak/undetected but have evidence for AGN activity from optical and/or mid-IR

these Compton-thick quasars would be classified as mid-IR excess galaxies, and
our study provides the first spectroscopic confirmation of Compton-thick AGN
activity in a subsample of these z~2 mid-IR bright galaxies. Using the four

blazar governs the appearance of its spectral energy distribution. The most
prominent result is the significant negative correlation between the
synchrotron peak frequencies and the synchrotron peak luminosities of the
blazar population. Observational studies of the blazar sequence have, in
general, neglected the effect of Doppler boosting. We study the dependence of
both the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity with Doppler-corrected
quantities. We determine the spectral energy distributions of 135 radio-bright
AGN and find the best-fit parabolic function for the distribution to quantify
their synchrotron emission. The corresponding measurements of synchrotron peak
luminosities and frequencies are Doppler-corrected with a new set of Doppler
factors calculated from variability data. The relevant correlations for the
blazar sequence are determined for these intrinsic quantities. The Doppler
factor depends strongly on the synchrotron peak frequency, the lower energy
sources being more boosted. Applying the Doppler correction to the peak
frequencies and luminosities annuls the negative correlation between the two
quantities, which becomes positive. For BL Lacertae objects, the positive
correlation is particularly strong. The blazar sequence, when defined as the
anticorrelation between the peak frequency and luminosity of the synchrotron
component of the spectral energy distribution, disappears when the intrinsic,
Doppler-corrected values are used. It is an observational phenomenon created by
variable Doppler boosting across the synchrotron peak frequency range.

variations in the central density concentrations. We show that the optical
depth for long and thin arcs increases by approximately one order of magnitude
when $\sigma_8$ increases from 0.7 to 0.9, owing to a constructive combination
of several effects. Models with high $\sigma_8$ are also several orders of
magnitude more efficient in producing arcs at intermediate and high redshifts.
Finally, we use realistic source number counts to quantitatively predict the
total number of arcs brighter than several magnitude limits in the R and I
bands. We confirm that, while $\sigma_8\sim0.9$ may come close to the known
abundance of arcs, even $\sigma_8\sim0.8$ falls short by almost an order of

$\sigma_8\sim0.8$ be confirmed, we would fail to understand the strong-lensing

DPLL procedure augmented with clause learning. The main bottleneck for such
algorithms, other than the obvious one of time, is the amount of memory used.
In the field of proof complexity, the resources of time and memory correspond
to the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long line of
research trying to understand these proof complexity measures, but while strong
results have been proven on length our understanding of space is still quite
poor. For instance, it remains open whether the fact that a formula is provable
in short length implies that it is also provable in small space or whether on
the contrary these measures are unrelated in the sense that short proofs can be
arbitrarily complex with respect to space.
  In this paper, we present some evidence that the true answer should be that
the latter case holds. We do this by proving a tight bound of Theta(sqrt(n)) on
the space needed for so-called pebbling contradictions over pyramid graphs of
size n. This yields the first polynomial lower bound on space that is not a
consequence of a corresponding lower bound on width, another well-studied
measure in resolution, as well as an improvement of the weak separation in
(Nordstrom 2006) of space and width from logarithmic to polynomial.
  Also, continuing the line of research initiated by (Ben-Sasson 2002) into
trade-offs between different proof complexity measures, we present a simplified
proof of the recent length-space trade-off result in (Hertel and Pitassi 2007),

trade-offs in resolution.

is necessary. It suggests that the wavefunction of the universe is mobile in
the landscape until the universe reaches a meta-stable site with its
cosmological constant $\Lambda_0$ smaller than the critical value $\Lambda_c$,
where $\Lambda_c$ is estimated to be exponentially small compared to the Planck
scale. Since this site has an exponentially long lifetime, it may well be
today's universe. We investigate specific scenarios based on this quantum
diffusion property of the cosmic landscape and find a plausible scenario for
the early universe. In the last fast tunneling to the $\Lambda_0$
($<\Lambda_c$) site in this scenario, all energies are stored in the nucleation
bubble walls, which are released to radiation only after bubble collisions and
thermalization. So the $\Lambda_0$ site is chosen even if $\Lambda_0$ plus
radiation is larger than $\Lambda_c$, as long as the radiation does not
destabilize the $\Lambda_0$ vacuum. A consequence is that inflation must happen
before this last fast tunneling, so the inflationary scenario that emerges
naturally is extended brane inflation, where the brane motion includes a
combination of rolling, fast tunnelings, slow-roll, hopping and percolation in
the landscape. We point out that, in the brane world, radiation during
nucleosynthesis are mostly on the standard model branes (brane radiation, as
opposed to radiation in the bulk). This distinction may lead to interesting
dynamics. We consider this paper as a road map for future investigations.

measures may not capture effects which are not negligible at the pointwise

the latter situation, two families of functions may have the same Wigner
measures at some initial time, but different Wigner measures for a larger time.
In the case of systems, this difficulty can partially be avoided by considering
more refined Wigner measures such as two-scale Wigner measures; however, we

provide variable selection consistency results and show that the S-Lasso
achieved a Sparsity Inequality, i.e., a bound in term of the number of non-zero

understanding of this interesting phenomenon. Specifically, we consider sonic

dispersion, so we add Bogoliubov dispersion to Unruh's equation for sound in
the fluid. A white-hole/black-hole horizon pair will then display black hole
lasing. Numerical analysis of the evolution of a wave packet gives a clear
picture of the amplification process. By utilizing the similarity of a

the black hole laser as a quantum-optical network.

adequate than the classical one. While we cannot reconstruct the classical
l^1-homology from the new definition for various reasons, we can reconstruct
its Hausdorffification so that no information concerning semi-norms is lost. We
obtain an axiomatic characterization of our l^1-homology as a universal
delta-functor and prove that it is pre-dual to our definition of bounded
cohomology. We thus answer a question raised by Loeh in her thesis. Moreover,
we prove Gromov's theorem and the Matsumoto-Morita conjecture in our context.

  Astrophysics (8 pages, 6 figures)",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200809655",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The >100 GeV gamma-ray source, HESS J1713-381, apparently associated with the
shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B, was discovered using H.E.S.S. in
2006. X-ray follow-up observations with Chandra were performed in 2007 with the
aim of identifying a synchrotron counterpart to the TeV source and/or thermal
emission from the SNR shell. These new Chandra data, together with additional
TeV data, allow us to investigate the nature of this object in much greater
detail than was previously possible. The new X-ray data reveal thermal emission
from a ~4' region in close proximity to the radio shell of CTB 37B. The
temperature of this emission implies an age for the remnant of ~5000 years and
an ambient gas density of ~0.5 cm-3. Both these estimates are considerably
uncertain due to the asymmetry of the SNR and possible modifications of the
kinematics due to efficient cosmic ray (CR) acceleration. A bright (~7x10-13erg
cm-2s-1) and unresolved (<1'') source (CXOU J171405.7-381031) with a soft
(\Gamma ~3.3) non-thermal spectrum is also detected in coincidence with the
radio shell. Absorption indicates a column density consistent with the thermal
emission from the shell suggesting a genuine association rather than a chance
alignment. The observed TeV morphology is consistent with an origin in the
complete shell of CTB 37B. The lack of diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission
suggests an origin of the gamma-ray emission via the decay of neutral pions
produced in interactions of protons and nuclei, rather than inverse Compton
(IC) emission from relativistic electrons.

geometry of the black string has symmetries of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and
construct a sigma model in the bulk. Analyzing the symmetries of the bulk
theory and comparing them with those of the CFT in a special light-cone gauge
we find agreement between global symmetries. Due to non-standard gauge
realization it is not clear how affine symmetries can be realized.

generalized Weyl algebra (of rank one, with commutative coeffiecient ring $R$),
which is assumed to carry an involution of the form $X^*=Y$, $R^*\subseteq R$.
We prove that a weight module $V$ is pseudo-unitarizable iff it is isomorphic
to its finitistic dual $V^\sharp$. Using the classification of weight modules
by Drozd, Guzner and Ovsienko, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions
for an indecomposable weight module to be isomorphic to its finitistic dual,
and thus to be pseudo-unitarizable. Some examples are given, including
$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $q$ a root of unity.
