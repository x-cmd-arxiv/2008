string amplitude from the perspective of the 4D-5D lift, in the context of
''magic'' N=2 supergravity theories. In particular, we interpret the
Gopakumar-Vafa relation between 5D black hole degeneracies and the topological
string amplitude as the result of a canonical transformation from 4D to 5D
charges. Moreover we use the known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of 5D black holes
to constrain the asymptotic behavior of the topological wave function at finite
topological coupling but large K\""ahler classes. In the process, some
subtleties in the relation between 5D black hole degeneracies and the
topological string amplitude are uncovered, but not resolved. Finally we extend
these considerations to the putative one-parameter generalization of the
topological string amplitude, and identify the canonical transformation as a
Weyl reflection inside the 3D duality group.

accurate knowledge of the beam patterns in flight. While the degree of beam
knowledge for the WMAP one-year and three-year results was unprecedented for a
CMB experiment, we have significantly improved the beam determination as part
of the five-year data release. Physical optics fits are done on both the A and
the B sides for the first time. The cutoff scale of the fitted distortions on
the primary mirror is reduced by a factor of ~2 from previous analyses. These
changes enable an improvement in the hybridization of Jupiter data with beam
models, which is optimized with respect to error in the main beam solid angle.
An increase in main-beam solid angle of ~1% is found for the V2 and W1-W4
differencing assemblies. Although the five-year results are statistically
consistent with previous ones, the errors in the five-year beam transfer
functions are reduced by a factor of ~2 as compared to the three-year analysis.
We present radiometry of the planet Jupiter as a test of the beam consistency
and as a calibration standard; for an individual differencing assembly, errors
in the measured disk temperature are ~0.5%.

the Lie algebra g, of G. Then, D/D.g is a holonomic D-module and its
restriction to a unique Zariski open dense G-orbit in X is a G-equivariant
local system. We prove a criterion saying that the D-module D/D.g is
isomorphic, under certain (quite restrictive) conditions, to a direct image of
that local system to X. We apply this criterion in the special case where the
group G=SL(n) acts diagonally on X = F \times F \times P^{n-1}, a triple
product where F is the flag manifold for SL(n) and P^{n-1} is the projective

  We further relate D-modules on F \times F \times P^{n-1} to D-modules on the

0.02273+-0.00062, Omega_c h^2 = 0.1099+-0.0062, Omega_L = 0.742+-0.030, n_s =

of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization,
tau>0, at 5 sigma significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization
is constrained to be z_reion = 11.0+-1.4 with 68% confidence. This excludes a
sudden reionization of the universe at z=6 at more than 3.5 sigma significance,
suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for
polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical
depth, indicating an error due to foreground treatment of tau~0.01. This
cosmological model also fits small-scale CMB data, and a range of astronomical
data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We
find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a non-zero
cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the
standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit LCDM model

galaxy clusters at z= 0.3-0.9. We have cross-correlated SDSS DR3 quasars with
high-redshift cluster/group candidates from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey. We
have found 442 quasar-cluster pairs for which the MgII doublet might be
detected at a transverse (physical) distance d<2 Mpc from the cluster centers.
To investigate the incidence (dN/dz) and equivalent-width distribution n(W) of
MgII systems at cluster redshifts, two statistical samples were drawn out of
these pairs: one made of high-resolution spectroscopic quasar observations (46
pairs), and one made of quasars used in MgII searches found in the literature
(375 pairs). The results are: (1) the population of strong MgII systems
(W_0>2.0 Ang.) near cluster redshifts shows a significant (>3 sigma)
overabundance (up to a factor of 15) when compared with the 'field' population;
(2) the overabundance is more evident at smaller distances (d<1 Mpc) than
larger distances (d<2 Mpc) from the cluster center; and, (3) the population of
weak MgII systems (W_0<0.3 Ang.) near cluster redshifts conform to the field
statistics. Unlike in the field, this dichotomy makes n(W) in clusters appear
flat and well fitted by a power-law in the entire W-range. A sub-sample of the
most massive clusters yields a stronger and still significant signal. Since
either the absorber number density or filling-factor/cross-section affects the
absorber statistics, an interesting possibility is that we have detected the
signature of truncated halos due to environmental effects. Thus, we argue that
the excess of strong systems is due to a population of absorbers in an
overdense galaxy environment, and the lack of weak systems to a different
population, that got destroyed in the cluster environment. (Abridged)

slot gap accelerator of a rotation-powered pulsar. Primary electrons
accelerating to high-altitudes in the unscreened electric field of the slot gap
reach radiation-reaction limited Lorentz factors of 2 x 10^7, while
electron-positron pairs from lower-altitude cascades flow along field lines
interior to the slot gap. The curvature, synchrotron and inverse Compton
radiation of both primary electrons and pairs produce a broad spectrum of
emission from infra-red to GeV energies. Both primaries and pairs undergo
cyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons, allowing them to maintain
significant pitch angles. Synchrotron radiation from pairs with a power-law
energy spectrum with Lorentz factors 10^2 - 10^5, dominate the spectrum up to
10 MeV. Synchrotron and curvature radiation of primaries dominates from 10 MeV
up to a few GeV. We examine the energy-dependent pulse profiles and
phase-resolved spectra for parameters of the Crab pulsar as a function of
magnetic inclination and viewing angle, comparing to broad-band data. In most
cases, the pulse profiles are dominated by caustics on trailing field lines. We
also explore the relation of the high-energy and the radio profiles, as well as

slow stretching at the wall forbids the rapid propagation of stretched
filaments throughout the whole domain, and hence delays the formation of an
eigenmode until it is no longer experimentally observable. Inspired by the

Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) remain unidentified. The EGRET
sources that have been properly identified are either pulsars or variable
sources at both radio and gamma-ray wavelengths. Most of the variable sources
are strong radio blazars.However, some low galactic-latitude EGRET sources,
with highly variable gamma-ray emission, lack any evident counterpart according
to the radio data available until now.
  Aims. The primary goal of this paper is to identify and characterise the
potential radio counterparts of four highly variable gamma-ray sources in the
galactic plane through mapping the radio surroundings of the EGRET confidence
contours and determining the variable radio sources in the field whenever
possible.
  Methods. We have carried out a radio exploration of the fields of the
selected EGRET sources using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
interferometer at 21 cm wavelength, with pointings being separated by months.
  Results. We detected a total of 151 radio sources. Among them, we identified
a few radio sources whose flux density has apparently changed on timescales of
months. Despite the limitations of our search, their possible variability makes
these objects a top-priority target for multiwavelength studies of the
potential counterparts of highly variable, unidentified gamma-ray sources.

decision decoding is based on syndromes. Recently, there has been renewed
interest in decoding RS codes without using syndromes. In this paper, we
investigate the complexity of syndromeless decoding for RS codes, and compare
it to that of syndrome-based decoding. Aiming to provide guidelines to
practical applications, our complexity analysis differs in several aspects from
existing asymptotic complexity analysis, which is typically based on
multiplicative fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques and is usually in big O
notation. First, we focus on RS codes over characteristic-2 fields, over which
some multiplicative FFT techniques are not applicable. Secondly, due to
moderate block lengths of RS codes in practice, our analysis is complete since
all terms in the complexities are accounted for. Finally, in addition to fast
implementation using additive FFT techniques, we also consider direct
implementation, which is still relevant for RS codes with moderate lengths.
Comparing the complexities of both syndromeless and syndrome-based decoding
algorithms based on direct and fast implementations, we show that syndromeless
decoding algorithms have higher complexities than syndrome-based ones for high
rate RS codes regardless of the implementation. Both errors-only and
errors-and-erasures decoding are considered in this paper. We also derive
tighter bounds on the complexities of fast polynomial multiplications based on
Cantor's approach and the fast extended Euclidean algorithm.

processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete
analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present
several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude
that Ka band data (33 GHz) is suitable for use in cosmological analysis, after
foreground cleaning. This significantly reduces the overall polarization
uncertainty. With the 5 year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from
the minimal 6-parameter LCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological
constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations.

argue that the substrate-free experiments done in the diffusive regime are

(i) removal of the substrate will increase mobility since most of the charged
impurities are in the substrate, (ii) the minimum conductivity is not
universal, but depends on impurity concentration with cleaner samples having a
higher minimum conductivity. We further argue that experiments on suspended

namely, the charged impurity concentration n_imp and d, the typical distance of
a charged impurity from the graphene sheet. The recent experiments on suspended
graphene indicate a residual impurity density of 1-2 \times 10^{10} cm^{-2}

detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider. The standard model predicts
that the electroweak interaction can produce a top quark together with an
antibottom quark or light quark, without the antiparticle top quark partner
that is always produced from strong coupling processes. Top quarks were first
observed in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top quark
production has been searched for in ever larger datasets. In this analysis, we
select events from a 0.9 fb-1 dataset that have an electron or muon and missing
transverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top quark decay, and
two, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating
from a b hadron decay. The selected events are mostly backgrounds such as
W+jets and ttbar events, which we separate from the expected signals using
three multivariate analysis techniques: boosted decision trees, Bayesian neural
networks, and matrix element calculations. A binned likelihood fit of the
signal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the
results from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single top
quark production of 4.7 +- 1.3 pb. The probability to measure a cross section

3.6 standard deviation significance. The measured cross section value is

observed by \hst for 126 orbits in 2005. The particular challenge of this data
set is that the faintest stars are not readily visible in individual exposures,
so special care must be taken to combine the information in all the exposures
in order to identify and measure them. Unfortunately, it is hard to find the
faintest stars without also finding a large number of faint galaxies, so we
developed specialized tools to distinguish between the point-like stars and the
barely resolved galaxies. We found that artificial-star tests, while obviously
necessary for completeness determination, can also play an important role in
helping us optimize our finding and measuring algorithms. Although this paper
focuses on this data set specifically, many of the techniques are new and might
find application in other work, particularly when a large number of images is
available for a single field.

However, according to Luttinger theory, which describes the low-energy

into the middle of such a wire, it will tend to break up into separate charge
pulses, moving in opposite directions, which carry definite fractions $f$ and
$(1-f)$ of the electron charge, determined by a parameter $g$ that measures the
strength of charge interactions in the wire. (The injected electron will also
produce a spin excitation, which will travel at a different velocity than the

planet orbiting a bright (V = 10.5) star with a small semi-major axis of a =

days, mid-transit time E = 2,453,790.2593 +/- 0.0010 (BJD). Based on the
available spectroscopic data on the host star and photometry of the system, the
planet has a mass of Mp = 1.78+/-^{0.08}_{0.05} MJup and radius of Rp =
1.36+/-^{0.20}_{0.09} RJup. The parent star is a slightly evolved F6 star with
M = 1.47+/-^{0.08}_{-0.05} Msun,R = 1.84+/-^{0.23}_{0.11} Rsun, Teff = 6350 +/-
80 K, and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.26 +/- 0.08. The relatively hot and large
host star, combined with the close orbit of the planet, yield a very high
planetary irradiance of (4.71+/-^{1.44}_{0.05}) 10^9 erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}, which
places the planet near the top of the pM class of irradiated planets as defined
by Fortney et al. (2007). If as predicted by Fortney et al. (2007) the planet
re-radiates its absorbed energy before distributing it to the night side, the
day-side temperature should be about (2730+/-^{150}_{100}) K. Because the host
star is quite bright, measurement of the secondary eclipse should be feasible
for ground-based telescopes, providing a good opportunity to compare the
predictions of current hot Jupiter atmospheric models with the observations.
Moreover, the host star falls in the field of the upcoming Kepler mission;
hence extensive space-borne follow-up, including not only primary transit and
secondary eclipse observations but also asteroseismology, will be possible.

show an enrichment of linear polymers in the immediate vicinity of the surface,

of stars. This excess increases with the number of star arms only up to a

Raman signal of a doped Mott insulator, resulting in an integrated intensity
which is proportional to the doping level. We provide a detailed derivation of

illustration of our method, we study the translocation of a Gaussian chain
between two spherical compartments connected by a cylindrical pore, and by a
composite pore consisting of two connected cylinders of different diameters,
which is structurally similar to the $\alpha$-hemolysin membrane channel. We
demonstrate that reverse chain motions between the pore constituents may
contribute significantly to the total translocation time. Our results further
establish that translocation through a two-cylinder composite pore is faster
when the chain is introduced into the pore on the cis (wide) side of the

X-ray counterpart of PSR J0108-1431.The pulsar spectrum can be described by a
power-law model with photon index Gamma \approx 2.2 and luminosity L_{0.3-8
keV} \sim 2\times 10^{28} d_{130}^2 ergs s^{-1}, or by a blackbody model with
the temperature kT\approx 0.28 keV and bolometric luminosity L_{bol} \sim
1.3\times 10^{28} d_{130}^2 ergs s^{-1}, for a plausible hydrogen column
density NH = 7.3\times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (d_{130}=d/130 pc). The pulsar converts
\sim 0.4% of its spin-down power into the X-ray luminosity, i.e., its X-ray
efficiency is higher than for most younger pulsars. From the comparison of the
X-ray position with the previously measured radio positions, we estimated the
pulsar proper motion of 0.2 arcsec yr^{-1} (V_\perp \sim 130 d_{130} km
s^{-1}), in the south-southeast direction.

coalgebra $C$ is co-Frobenius if and only if it is isomorphic to its rational
dual. We consider the more general quasi-co-Frobenius (QcF) coalgebras; in the
first main result we show that these also admit symmetric characterizations: a
coalgebra is QcF if it is weakly isomorphic to its (left, or equivalently
right) rational dual $Rat(C^*)$, in the sense that certain coproduct or product
powers of these objects are isomorphic. These show that QcF coalgebras can be
viewed as generalizations of both co-Frobenius coalgebras and Frobenius
algebras. Surprisingly, these turn out to have many applications to fundamental
results of Hopf algebras. The equivalent characterizations of Hopf algebras
with left (or right) nonzero integrals as left (or right) co-Frobenius, or QcF,
or semiperfect or with nonzero rational dual all follow immediately from these
results. Also, the celebrated uniqueness of integrals follows at the same time
as just another equivalent statement. Moreover, as a by-product of our methods,
we observe a short proof for the bijectivity of the antipode of a Hopf algebra
with nonzero integral. This gives a purely representation theoretic approach to
many of the basic fundamental results in the theory of Hopf algebras.

conformal field theories with extended W symmetry. To make contact with the
extended picture starting from the lattice, we identify 4p-2 boundary
conditions as specific limits of integrable boundary conditions of the
underlying Yang-Baxter integrable lattice models. Specifically, we identify 2p
integrable boundary conditions to match the 2p known irreducible
W-representations. These 2p extended representations naturally decompose into
infinite sums of the irreducible Virasoro representations (r,s). A further 2p-2
reducible yet indecomposable W-representations of rank 2 are generated by
fusion and these decompose as infinite sums of indecomposable rank-2 Virasoro
representations. The fusion rules in the extended picture are deduced from the
known fusion rules for the Virasoro representations of LM(1,p) and are found to
be in agreement with previous works. The closure of the fusion algebra on a
finite number of representations in the extended picture is remarkable
confirmation of the consistency of the lattice approach.

noisy perturbations, termed the subspace pursuit algorithm. The algorithm has
two important characteristics: low computational complexity, comparable to that
of orthogonal matching pursuit techniques when applied to very sparse signals,
and reconstruction accuracy of the same order as that of LP optimization
methods. The presented analysis shows that in the noiseless setting, the
proposed algorithm can exactly reconstruct arbitrary sparse signals provided
that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property with a
constant parameter. In the noisy setting and in the case that the signal is not
exactly sparse, it can be shown that the mean squared error of the
reconstruction is upper bounded by constant multiples of the measurement and
signal perturbation energies.

This assumption produces the source of systematic error in $R_0$ value owing to
a probable motion of Sgr A* relative to the accepted velocity reference system
which is arbitrary to some extent. Eisenhauer et al. justify neglecting all
three spatial velocity components of Sgr A* mainly by low limits of Sgr A*'s
proper motion of 20--60 km/s. In this brief paper, a simple analysis in the
context of the Keplerian dynamics was used to demonstrate that neglect of even
low (perhaps, formal) radial velocity of Sgr A* leads to a substantial
systematic error in $R_0$: the same limits of 20--60 km/s result in $R_0$
errors of 1.3--5.6%, i.e., (0.1--0.45)$\times (R_0/8)$ kpc, for current S2

by collisions (quenched) before they decay radiatively. In low-density regions,
however, the low collision rate may allow depopulation by electric dipole (E1)
forbidden radiative transitions, so-called forbidden lines (mainly M1 and E2
transitions). If the atomic transition data are known, these lines are
indicators of physical plasma conditions and used for abundance determination.
Aims. Transition rates can be derived by combining relative intensities between
the decay channels, so-called branching fractions (BFs), and the radiative
lifetime of the common upper level. We use this approach for forbidden [Sc ii]
lines, along with new calculations. Methods. Neither BFs for forbidden lines,
nor lifetimes of metastable levels, are easily measured in a laboratory.
Therefore, astrophysical BFs measured in Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) spectra of the strontium filament of Eta Carinae are combined with
lifetime measurements using a laser probing technique on a stored ion-beam
(CRYRING facility,MSL, Stockholm). These quantities are used to derive the
absolute transition rates (A-values). New theoretical transition rates and
lifetimes are calulated using the CIV3 code. Results. We report experimental

the dI/dV due to a bias-induced interplay between the position of the HOMO and
LUMO levels. The effect is suppressed by self-interaction errors and is
therefore unlikely to be observed in standard transport calculations based on
density functional theory. Inclusion of dynamic correlations lead to
substantial renormalization of the energy levels. In particular, we find a

HD 155555 (V824 Ara, G5IV + K0IV) system were obtained at the Anglo-Australian
Telescope in 2004 and 2007. Both datasets are analysed using a new binary
Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) code. This allows us to simultaneously model the
contribution of each component to the observed circularly polarised spectra.
Stellar brightness maps are also produced for HD 155555 and compared to
previous Doppler images. Our radial magnetic maps reveal a complex surface
magnetic topology with mixed polarities at all latitudes. We find rings of
azimuthal field on both stars, most of which are found to be non-axisymmetric
with the stellar rotational axis. We also examine the field strength and the
relative fraction of magnetic energy stored in the radial and azimuthal field
components at both epochs. A marked weakening of the field strength of the
secondary star is observed between the 2004 and 2007 epochs. This is
accompanied by an apparent shift in the location of magnetic energy from the
azimuthal to radial field. We suggest that this could be indicative of a
magnetic activity cycle. We use the radial magnetic maps to extrapolate the
coronal field (by assuming a potential field) for each star individually - at
present ignoring any possible interaction. The secondary star is found to
exhibit an extreme tilt (~75 deg) of its large scale magnetic field to that of
its rotation axis for both epochs. The field complexity that is apparent in the
surface maps persists out to a significant fraction of the binary separation.
Any interaction between the fields of the two stars is therefore likely to be
complex also. Modelling this would require a full binary field extrapolation.

final fate of massive stars and their chemical yields. Its Z-dependence is
discussed in relation to the formation of long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)
and the yields from early stellar generations. However, the mechanism of
formation of WR-type stellar winds is still under debate. We present the first
fully self-consistent atmosphere/wind models for late-type WN stars. We
investigate the mechanisms leading to their strong mass loss, and examine the
dependence on stellar parameters, in particular on the metallicity Z. We
identify WNL stars as very massive stars close to the Eddington limit,
potentially still in the phase of central H-burning. Due to their high L/M
ratios, these stars develop optically thick, radiatively driven winds. These
winds show qualitatively different properties than the thin winds of OB stars.
The resultant mass loss depends strongly on Z, but also on the Eddington
factor, and the stellar temperature. We combine our results in a parametrized
mass loss recipe for WNL stars. According to our present model computations,
stars close to the Eddington limit tend to form strong WR-type winds, even at
very low Z. Our models thus predict an efficient mass loss mechanism for low
metallicity stars. For extremely metal-poor stars, we find that the
self-enrichment with primary nitrogen can drive WR-type mass loss. These first
WN stars might play an important role in the enrichment of the early ISM with
freshly produced nitrogen.

in order to obtain the first sample of magnetic upper main sequence stars with
precisely known ages. These data will constrain theories of field evolution in
these stars. Using the new spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS at CFHT, we have
obtained 44 measurements of the mean longitudinal fields of 23 B6 - A2 stars
that have been identified as possible Ap stars and that are possible members of
open clusters, with a median uncertainty of about 45 G. Of these stars, 10 have
definite field detections. Nine stars of our sample are found not to be
magnetic Ap stars. The ESPaDOnS data contain a large amount of useful
information not readily obtained from lower resolution spectropolarimetry. With
the new observations we are able to expand the available data on fields of
low-mass, relatively evolved Ap stars, and identify more robustly which
observed stars are actually magnetic Ap stars and cluster members. Re-analysis
of the enlarged data set of cluster Ap stars indicates that such stars with
masses in the range of 2 -- 5 \mo show RMS fields larger than about 1 kG only
when they are near the ZAMS. The time scale on which these large fields
disappear varies strongly with mass, ranging from about 250 Myr for stars of 2
- 3 solar mass to 15 Myr for stars of 4 - 5 solar mass. Our data are consistent
either with emergent flux conservation for most (but not all) Ap stars, or with
modest decline in flux with age.

for the errors of frequency, inclination and rotational splitting. The
determination of the inclination is very challenging for the common case of
slow rotators (like the Sun), making difficult the determination of a reliable
rotational splitting. Moreover, due to the numerous correlations, biases - more
or less significant - can appear in the determination of various parameters in
the case of bad inclination fittings, especially when a locking at 90 degrees
occurs. This issue concerning inclination locking is also discussed.
Nevertheless, the central frequency and some derived parameters such as the
