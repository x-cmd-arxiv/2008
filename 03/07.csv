lattice (TKL), formed by inserting triangles into the triangles of the kagome
lattice. Because the TKL is a non-bipartite lattice, dimer-dimer correlations
are short-ranged, so that the ground state at the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point
of the corresponding quantum dimer model on the same lattice is a short-ranged
spin liquid. Using the Pfaffian method, we derive an exact form for the free
energy, and we find that the entropy is 1/3 ln2 per site, regardless of the
weights of the bonds. The occupation probability of every bond is 1/4 in the
case of equal weights on every bond. Similar to the case of lattices formed by
corner-sharing triangles (such as the kagome and squagome lattices), we find
that the dimer-dimer correlation function is identically zero beyond a certain
(short) distance. We find in addition that monomers are deconfined on the TKL,
indicating that there is a short-ranged spin liquid phase at the RK point. We
also find exact results for the ground state energy of the classical Heisenberg
model. The ground state can be ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, locally coplanar,
or locally canted, depending on the couplings. From the dimer model and the
classical spin model, we derive upper bounds on the ground state energy of the
quantum Heisenberg model on the TKL.

We present families of subsystem and asymmetric quantum codes derived, once

derive an interesting asymmetric and symmetric subsystem codes based on
classical BCH codes with parameters $[[n,k,r,d]]_q$, $[[n,k,r,d_z/d_x]]_q$ and
$[[n,k',0,d_z/d_x]]_q$ for arbitrary values of code lengths and dimensions. We
establish asymmetric Singleton and Hamming bounds on asymmetric quantum and

Finally, our constructions are well explained by an illustrative example.

structural properties of complexes of multivalent cationic lipids and DNA
molecules. At low mole fraction of neutral lipids (NLs), $\Phi_{\rm NL}$, the
complexes show dramatic DNA compaction down to essentially close packed DNA
arrays with a DNA interaxial spacing $d_{\rm DNA}=25\AA$. A gradual increase in
$\Phi_{\rm NL}$ does not lead to a continuous increase in $d_{\rm DNA}$ as
observed for DNA complexes of monovalent cationic lipids (CLs). Instead,
distinct spacing regimes exist, with sharp transitions between them. Three
packing states have been identified: (i) close packed, (ii) condensed, but not
close packed, with $d_{\rm DNA}=27-28\AA$, and (iii) an expanded state, where
$d_{\rm DNA}$ increases gradually with $\Phi_{\rm NL}$. Based on our
experimental and computational results, we conclude that the DNA condensation
is mediated by the multivalent cationic lipids, which assemble between the
negatively charged DNA rods. Quite remarkably, the computational results show
that the less tightly packed structure in regime (ii) is thermodynamically more
stable than the close packed structure in regime (i). Accordingly, the constant
DNA spacing observed in regime (ii) is attributed to lateral phase coexistence
between this stable CL-DNA complex and neutral membranes. This finding may
explain the reduced transfection efficiency measured for such complexes:
Transfection involves endosomal escape and disassembly of the complex, and
these processes are inhibited by the high thermodynamic stability. Our results,
which demonstrate the existence of an inverse correlation between the stability
and transfection activity of lamellar CL-DNA complexes are, therefore,
consistent with a recently proposed model of cellular entry.

attention recently because of its importance to predictions for and
cosmological constraints from CMB observations. While the central role of the
two-photon decay 2s->1s has been recognized for many decades, high-precision
calculations require us to consider two-photon decays from the higher states
ns,nd->1s (n>=3). Simple attempts to include these processes in recombination
calculations have suffered from physical problems associated with sequences of
one-photon decays, e.g. 3d->2p->1s, that technically also produce two photons.
These correspond to resonances in the two-photon spectrum that are optically
thick, necessitating a radiative transfer calculation. We derive the
appropriate equations, develop a numerical code to solve them, and verify the
results by finding agreement with analytic approximations to the radiative
transfer equation. The related processes of Raman scattering and two-photon
recombination are included using similar machinery. Our results show that early
in recombination the two-photon decays act to speed up recombination, reducing
the free electron abundance by 1.3% relative to the standard calculation at
z=1300. However we find that some photons between Ly-alpha and Ly-beta are
produced, mainly by 3d->1s two-photon decay and 2s->1s Raman scattering. At
later times these photons redshift down to Ly-alpha, excite hydrogen atoms, and
act to slow recombination. Thus the free electron abundance is increased by
1.3% relative to the standard calculation at z=900. The implied correction to
the CMB power spectrum is neligible for the recently released WMAP and ACBAR
data, but at Fisher matrix level will be 7 sigma for Planck. [ABRIDGED]

to dissolve into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). After a short introduction to
the basic elements of QCD in the vacuum, most notably quark confinement and
mass generation, we discuss how these phenomena relate to phase changes in
strongly interacting matter at high temperature. We briefly review the main
experimental findings at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) which
provide strong evidence that a QGP has been produced, with unprecedentedly
small viscosity and large opacity. We discuss how heavy quarks (charm and
bottom) can be utilized to quantitatively probe the transport properties of a
strongly coupled QGP (sQGP). The large heavy-quark (HQ) mass allows to set up a
Brownian motion approach, which can serve to evaluate different approaches for
HQ interactions in the sQGP. The implementation of lattice QCD based HQ
potentials generates pre-hadronic resonance structures in HQ scattering in the
medium, leading to large interaction rates and small diffusion coefficients.
The resonance correlations are strongest close to the critical temperature
(T_c), suggesting an intimate connection to the hadronization of the QGP. The
implementation of HQ transport into Langevin simulations of an expanding QGP
fireball at RHIC enables quantitative comparisons with experiment. The
extracted HQ diffusion coefficients are employed for schematic estimates of the
shear viscosity, corroborating the notion of a strongly-coupled QGP in the
vicinity of T_c.

distribution, in particular whether this is exponential, Gaussian, or even some
other form. Here we resolve the issue for the case of the force network
ensemble in two dimensions. We demonstrate that conservation of the total area
of a reciprocal tiling, a direct consequence of local force balance, is crucial
for predicting the local stress distribution. Maximizing entropy while
conserving the tiling area and total pressure leads to a distribution of local
pressures with a generically Gaussian tail that is in excellent agreement with
numerics, both with and without friction and for two different contact
networks.

interaction of spinning binaries, we extend the Effective One Body (EOB)
description of the dynamics of two spinning black holes to next-to-leading

is constructed from four main ingredients: (i) a transformation between the
``effective'' Hamiltonian and the ``real'' one, (ii) a generalized effective
Hamilton-Jacobi equation involving higher powers of the momenta, (iii) a
Kerr-type effective metric (with Pad\'e-resummed coefficients) which depends on
the choice of some basic ``effective spin vector'' $\bf{S}_{\rm eff}$, and
which is deformed by comparable-mass effects, and (iv) an additional effective
spin-orbit interaction term involving another spin vector $\bsigma$. As a first
application of the new, NLO spin-dependent EOB Hamiltonian, we compute the
binding energy of circular orbits (for parallel spins) as a function of the
orbital frequency, and of the spin parameters. We also study the
characteristics of the last stable circular orbit: binding energy, orbital
frequency, and the corresponding dimensionless spin parameter $\hat{a}_{\rm
LSO}\equiv c J_{\rm LSO}/\boldsymbol(G(H_{\rm LSO}/c^2)^2\boldsymbol)$. We find
that the inclusion of NLO spin-orbit terms has a significant ``moderating''

fixed points on the Ising-model plane. Our results for the isotropic Heisenberg

results without worrying about whether such a comparison in fact makes sense.
Because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxy
surveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, this
situation is very unfortunate. We here present the first systematic comparison
study of thirteen different void finders constructed using particles, haloes,
and semi--analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of the

over the past decade. We show their results and discuss their differences and
agreements. As it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agree
very well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centre
of our volume. Voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 percent of
the mean cosmic density. In addition, those void finders that allow for void
galaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. For example, the
overdensity of void galaxies brighter than $m_B = -20 $ is found to be smaller
than about -0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.

central potential V(r). Differently from other approaches to this problem, we
do not assume that the potential is close to the Newtonian one. The main idea
in the deduction is to apply the underlying symmetries of the system to show
that delta must be a function of r V''(r)/V'(r), and to use the transformation
behaviour of delta in a rotating system of reference. This is equivalent to
say, that the effective potential can be written in a one-parameter set of
possibilities as sum of centrifugal potential and potential of the central
force. We get a universal formula for delta. It has to be read as follows: a
circular orbit at this value r exists and is stable if and only if this delta
is a well-defined real; and if this is the case, then the angular difference
from one perihelion to the next one for nearly circular orbits at this r is
exactly 2 pi + delta. Then we show how to apply this result to examples of
recent interest like modified Newtonian gravity and linearized fourth-order
gravity. In the second part of the paper, we generalize this universal formula
to static spherically symmetric space-times. For the Schwarzschild black hole
with mass parameter m > 0 it leads to a surprisingly unknown formula. It
represents a strict result and is applicable for all values r > 6m and is in
good agreement with the fact that stable circular orbits exist for r > 6m only.

we find that when the number of particles is sufficiently large the level
density follows a Gaussian distribution with great accuracy. We also show that
the distribution of (normalized) spacings between consecutive levels is of
neither Poisson nor Wigner type, but is qualitatively similar to that of the
original Haldane-Shastry spin chain. This suggests that spin chains of
Haldane-Shastry type are exceptional integrable models, since they do not
satisfy a well-known conjecture of Berry and Tabor according to which the
spacings distribution of a generic integrable system should be Poissonian. We
derive a simple analytic expression for the cumulative spacings distribution of
the BC_N-type Polychronakos-Frahm chain using only a few essential properties

the energy levels are equally spaced. This expression is in excellent agreement

satisfy differential privacy, a notion that provides strong confidentiality
guarantees in contexts where aggregate information is released about a database
containing sensitive information about individuals. We demonstrate that,
ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to privately agnostically
learn any concept class using a sample size approximately logarithmic in the
cardinality of the concept class. Therefore, almost anything learnable is
learnable privately: specifically, if a concept class is learnable by a
(non-private) algorithm with polynomial sample complexity and output size, then
it can be learned privately using a polynomial number of samples. We also
present a computationally efficient private PAC learner for the class of parity
functions. Local (or randomized response) algorithms are a practical class of
private algorithms that have received extensive investigation. We provide a
precise characterization of local private learning algorithms. We show that a
concept class is learnable by a local algorithm if and only if it is learnable

and C2H, which are not included in current astrochemical databases, overcome
their moderate activation energies at warm temperatures and become very
important for the gas phase synthesis of C-bearing molecules. The
photodissociation of CO and release of C triggers the formation of simple
organic species such as C2H2, HCN, and CH4. In timescales between 1 and 10,000
years, depending on the density and FUV field, a steady state is reached in the
model in which molecules are continuously photodissociated but also formed,
mainly through gas phase chemical reactions involving H2. The application of
the model to the upper layers of inner protoplanetary disks predicts large gas
phase abundances of C2H2 and HCN. The implied vertical column densities are as
large as several 10^(16) cm^(-2) in the very inner disk (< 1 AU), in good
agreement with the recent infrared observations of warm C2H2 and HCN in the

properties of our world from the mathematical structure, or how many

  In this letter we present some results which can be regarded as a
strengthening of MUH, as they give some hints on the derivation of spacetime in
current physics from a baggage free mathematical structure.
  Concretely, we argue that the set of mathematical structures which can be
interpreted as a description of a spacetime is drastically reduced, if one
admits some natural postulates on minimal symmetry. Furthermore, the apparently
very particular form of classical Galilei-Newton and relativistic spacetimes,
is not arbitrary and cannot be regarded as ``two possibilities among
arbitrarily many others''. In fact, such theories are determined by a single
mathematical structure which only permits four possible types of spacetimes.
Finally, we show how the minimal postulates on symmetry can be endowed with a
simple physical interpretation, i.e., they acquire ``baggage'' in a natural
way.

the functions affected by the defective gene, or to compensate for the lost

computationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme, and thus are
unable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that
several of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional
gene deletions that restore their growth rate. In a rather counterintuitive
fashion, this is achieved via additional damage to the metabolic network. Using
flux balance-based approaches, we identify a number of synthetically viable
gene pairs, in which the removal of one enzyme-encoding gene results in a
nonviable phenotype, while the deletion of a second enzyme-encoding gene
rescues the organism. The systematic network-based identification of
compensatory rescue effects may open new avenues for genetic interventions.

start with presenting a simple probabilistic framework for transaction data
which can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations are
present. We use such data and a real-world database from a grocery outlet to
explore the behavior of confidence and lift, two popular interest measures used
for rule mining. The results show that confidence is systematically influenced
by the frequency of the items in the left hand side of rules and that lift
performs poorly to filter random noise in transaction data. Based on the
probabilistic framework we develop two new interest measures, hyper-lift and

The new measures show significantly better performance than lift for
applications where spurious rules are problematic.

the weak equivalence principle. As we consider stationary, energy eigenstates,

clock, suitably coupled to the particle. By considering the clock as a small

that the time of flight is equal to the classical result, when the measurement

approximation of the maximum generalized flow and minimum cost generalized flow
in time tildeO(m^(3/2) * log(1/epsilon)). In many parameter ranges, this
improves over previous algorithms by a factor of approximately m^(1/2). We also

ultrarelativistic electrons by magnetic turbulence. In particular, we discuss
the steady-state energy spectra of particles undergoing momentum diffusion due
to resonant interactions with turbulent MHD modes, taking rigorously into
account direct energy losses connected with different radiative cooling
processes. For the magnetic turbulence we assume a given power spectrum of the
type $W(k) \propto k^{-q}$. In contrast to the previous approaches, however, we
assume a finite range of turbulent wavevectors $k$, consider a variety of
turbulence spectral indexes $1 =< q =< 2$, and concentrate on the case of a
very inefficient particle escape from the acceleration site. We find that for
different cooling and injection conditions, stochastic acceleration processes
tend to establish a modified ultrarelativistic Maxwellian distribution of
radiating particles, with the high-energy exponential cut-off shaped by the
interplay between cooling and acceleration rates. For example, if the timescale
for the dominant radiative process scales with the electron momentum as
$\propto p^r$, the resulting electron energy distribution is of the form
$n_e(p) \propto p^2 exp[ - (1 / a) (p / p_eq)^a]$, where $a = 2-q-r$, and
$p_eq$ is the equilibrium momentum defined by the balance between stochastic
acceleration and energy losses timescales. We also discuss in more detail the
synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission spectra produced by such an electron
energy distribution, taking into account Klein-Nishina effects. We point out
that the curvature of the high frequency segments of these spectra, even though
being produced by the same population of electrons, may be substantially
different between the synchrotron and inverse-Compton components.

accurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to be
generally applicable to any galaxy sample where SF and AGN galaxies are the two
dominant populations.
  In order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,
we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the VLA-COSMOS
survey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. We classify the
objects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) AGN, 4) SF, and
5) high redshift (z>1.3) galaxies. We find, for the composition of the
submillijansky radio population, that SF galaxies are not the dominant
population at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but that
they make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux density
range of ~50 microJy to 0.7 mJy. In summary, based on the entire VLA-COSMOS
radio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these flux
densities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of SF and 50-60% of AGN galaxies, with
a minor contribution (~10%) of QSOs.

the conditions which give the upper [or lower] bounds on size and probability

formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) could simultaneously be present in

formation are needed to explain the spectral properties of most IR sources. The
LIRG and ULIRG phases occur, on average, between 10^7 and 10^8 years after the
onset of a starburst on top of underlying older stellar populations. These

cutting plane of each lattice orientation) on the cohesive laws and polycrystal
fracture. We find that the atomistic simulations fracture at lower levels of
external stress, indicating that the initiation of fracture in the atomistic

decay into a pair of half-BPS dyons. Across these walls the dyon spectrum
changes discontinuously, and as a result the spectrum is not manifestly
invariant under S-duality transformation of the charges. However the partition
function is manifestly S-duality invariant and takes the same form in all

objects are highly embedded (A_J~5) and reside near known protostars,
indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster
(<1 Myr). The L0 source is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I. Its
luminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 M_sun, making it the least massive
brown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. To
characterize the disk population in Chamaeleon I, we have classified the
infrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that are
encompassed by the Spitzer images. Through these classifications, we find that
the disk fraction in Chamaeleon I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3
M_sun. These data are similar to the disk fraction of IC 348, which is a denser
cluster at the same age as Chamaeleon I. However, the disk fraction at M>1
M_sun is significantly higher in Chamaeleon I than in IC 348 (65% vs. 20%),
indicating longer disk lifetimes in Chamaeleon I for this mass range. Thus,
low-density star-forming regions like Chamaeleon I may offer more time for
planet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.

traditional infinite gas cloud model described by Ulrich (1976). We show that
the streamlines and density profiles obtained deviate largely from the ones
calculated by Ulrich. The extra freedom in the choice of the parameters on the

as represented by the rock-scissors-paper game, have attracted practical and
theoretical interests. In evolutionary dynamics, cyclic competition results in
oscillatory dynamics of densities of individual strategists. In finite-size
populations, it is known that oscillations blow up until all but one strategies
are eradicated if without mutation. In the present paper, we formalize
replicator dynamics with players that have different adaptation rates. We show
analytically and numerically that the heterogeneous adaptation rate suppresses
the oscillation amplitude. In social dilemma games with cyclically competing
strategies and homogeneous adaptation rates, altruistic strategies are often
relatively weak and cannot survive in finite-size populations. In such
situations, heterogeneous adaptation rates save coexistence of different
strategies and hence promote altruism. When one strategy dominates the others
without cyclic competition, fast adaptors earn more than slow adaptors. When
not, mixture of fast and slow adaptors stabilizes population dynamics, and slow
adaptation does not imply inefficiency for a player.

motion through the intracluster medium of a galaxy cluster, appears to be a
common phenomenon. Not every galaxy, however, is completely stripped of its gas
disk. If the ram pressure is insufficiently strong, only the outer parts of the
gas disk are removed, and the inner gas disk is retained by the galaxy. One
example of such a case is the Virgo spiral NGC 4402. Observations of NGC 4402
(Crowl et al. 2005) reveal structures at the leading edge of the gas disk,
which resemble the characteristic finger-like structures produced by the
Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. We argue, however, that the RT instability is
unlikely to be responsible for these structures. We demonstrate that the
conditions under which a galaxy's disk gas experiences ram pressure stripping
are identical to those that lead to RT instability. If the galaxy's gravity
prevents ram pressure stripping of the inner disk, it also prevents the RT
instability. In contrast, the stripped gas could still be subject to RT
instability, and we discuss consequences for the stripped gas.

network (ANN) model to approximate the nonlinear inverse mapping between
synthesized Stokes spectra and the underlying stratification of atmospheric
parameters like temperature, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and LOS magnetic
field. This approach not only allows us to incorporate more reliable physics
into the inversion process, it also enables the inversion on an absolute
geometrical height scale, which allows the subsequent combination of individual
line-of-sight stratifications to obtain a complete 3-dimensional reconstruction
(tomography) of the observed area. RESULTS : The magnetoconvection simulation
data, as well as the ANN inversion, have been properly processed to be
applicable to spectropolarimetric observations from the Hinode satellite. For
the first time, we show 3-dimensional tomographic reconstructions (temperature,
LOS velocity, and LOS magnetic field) of a quiet sun region observed by Hinode.
The reconstructed area covers a field of approximately 12000 by 12000 km and a
height range of 510 km in the photosphere. An enormous variety of small and
large scale structures can be identified in the 3-D reconstructions. The
low-flux region (B_{mag} = 20G) we analyzed exhibits a number of ""tube-like""
magnetic structures with field strengths of several hundred Gauss. Most of
these structures rapidly loose their strength with height and only a few larger
structures can retain a higher field strength to the upper layers of the

emission, depending on the type of central black hole (BH), whether it is

emission of an accretion disk around supermassive BH using numerical

spans an altitude range of ~3,500 km, corresponding to pressures between ~0.001

requires either condensation into sodium sulfide or ionization, necessary to
deplete atomic sodium only at high altitudes below pressures of ~3 mbar. The
depletion of sodium is supported by an observed sudden abundance change, from 2
times solar abundance in the lower atmosphere to 0.2 solar or lower in the
upper atmosphere. Our findings also indicate the presence of a hot atmosphere
near stratospheric altitudes corresponding to pressures of 33 mbar, consistent
with that of the observed dayside temperature inversion. In addition, we find a
separate higher altitude temperature rise is necessary within both the
condensation and ionization models, corresponding to pressures below ~0.01
mbar. This hot higher altitude temperature indicates that absorption by atomic
sodium can potentially probe the bottom of the thermosphere, and is possibly
sensitive to the temperature rise linked to atmospheric escape.

cores increases towards higher masses and the most massive cores are all
protostellar. In this paper we consider the possible explanations of this
apparent mass dependence in the evolutionary status of these cores, and the
implications for protostellar evolution and the mapping of the embedded core
mass function (CMF) onto the stellar IMF. We consider the following potential
causes: dust temperature; selection effects in the submillimetre and in the
mid-infrared observations used for pre/protostellar classification; confusion
and multiplicity; transient cores; and varying evolutionary timescales. We
develop Core Mass Evolution Diagrams (CMEDs) to investigate how the mass
evolution of individual cores maps onto the observed CMF. Two physical
mechanisms -- short timescales for the evolution of massive cores, and
continuing accumulation of mass onto protostellar cores -- best explain the
relative excess of protostars in high mass cores and the rarity of massive
starless cores. In addition, confusion both increases the likelihood that a
protostar is identified within a core, and increases mass assigned to a core.
The observed pre/protostellar mass distributions are consistent with faster
evolution and a shorter lifetime for higher-mass prestellar cores. We rule out
longer timescales for higher-mass prestellar cores. The differences in the
prestellar and protostellar mass distributions imply that the prestellar CMF
(and possibly the combined pre+protostellar CMF) should be steeper than the
IMF. A steeper prestellar CMF can be reconciled with the observed similarity of
the CMF and the IMF in some regions if a second opposing effect is present,
such as the fragmentation of massive cores into multiple systems.

stellar halo at 20 kpc (~4 Reff) reveals close coincidence at the metal-rich
ends of the distributions. However, an inner 8 kpc stellar MDF shows a clear
excess of metal-rich stars when compared to the GCs. We compare a higher S/N
subsample (147 GCs) with two stellar population models which include non-solar
abundance ratio corrections. The vast majority of our sample (~90%) appears
old, with ages similar to the Milky Way GC system. There is evidence for a
population of intermediate-age (~4-8 Gy) GCs (<15% of the sample) which are on
average more metal-rich than the old GCs. We also identify at least one younger
cluster (~1-2 Gy) in the central regions of the galaxy. Our observations are
consistent with a picture where NGC 5128 has undergone at least two mergers
and/or interactions involving star formation and limited GC formation since
z=1, however the effect of non-canonical hot stellar populations on the
integrated spectra of GCs remains an outstanding uncertainty in our GC age
estimates.

demanding even for medium sized 3D domains. In numerics, a domain decomposition
method is a commonly used strategy to overcome this problem. Within this
approach the overall computational domain is split up into smaller domains and
interface conditions are used to assure continuity of the electromagnetic

propagation problems. In an earlier paper we therefore proposed a domain
decomposition method adapted to electromagnetic field wave propagation
problems. In this paper we apply this method to 3D mask simulation.

the expansion of the universe. In this family there also exist flat power law
cosmological scenarios where one of the fluids may have a ``cosmological

solution for the scale factor is not described by power--law expressions and
has a more complicated behavior. In this study is considered also the
associated single fluid model interpretation for the interaction between two

simulations and the future of the universe. We argue that a simulation of an
entire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us
to tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a
single simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological
evolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution
(a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we
would ""replay the tape of the universe"" with the same or different laws and
initial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world
modelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire
universe, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that
we may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a
simulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new
universe. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative
philosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the
heat death problem in cosmology. The reader is invited to consult Annex 1 for

lattice spacing is complicated by the fact that there is a smooth cross-over
region in which the strong coupling expansion transforms into a weak-coupling
one. For N > 4, however, there is a first order bulk transition that cleanly
separates the strong and weak coupling regimes. We find that in this case the
calculated string tension can be readily fitted throughout the weak coupling
region by a standard 3-loop expression modified by lattice spacing corrections
of the expected form. While our fits demand the presence of the latter, they do
not constrain the perturbative coupling scheme enough to enable us to extract a
usefully accurate value of a(beta) in units of Lambda_MSbar. To resolve this
ambiguity we turn to SU(3) where we use the Schrodinger Functional coupling
scheme to extract a value of r_0 x Lambda_SF as a benchmark. We then find that
the Parisi mean-field improved coupling scheme closely reproduces this result.
We also develop a comparison between different schemes that does not rely on
the calculation of any physical quantity and which can therefore be applied
much further into weak coupling. Again the Parisi scheme is favoured over the
others that we compare. Using the mean-field scheme we have fitted the values
of the string tension that have been calculated for N=2 to N=8, to obtain
Lambda_MSbar/sqrt(sigma) = 0.503(2)(40) + 0.33(3)(3)/N^2 for N > 2, where the
first error is statistical and the second is our estimate of the systematic

corrections to the conventional Drude conductivity are determined by the
configurational part of the partition function. The activation energy for the

generalization of f(R) gravity theories corresponding to the coupling
Q=-1/sqrt{6}. We find that these models can be made compatible with local
gravity constraints even when |Q| is of the order of unity through a chameleon
mechanism, if the scalar-field potential is chosen to have a sufficiently large
mass in the high-curvature regions. We show that these models generally lead to
the divergence of the equation of state of DE, which occur at smaller redshifts
as the deviation from the LambdaCDM model become more significant. We also
study the evolution of matter density perturbations and employ them to place
bounds on the coupling |Q| as well as model parameters of the field potential

original space curve. The algorithm is designed to provide the exact result for
all inputs. It's a symbolic-numeric algorithm based on subresultant
computation. Simple algebraic criteria are given to certify the output of the
algorithm. The algorithm uses only one projection of the non-reduced space

  of Networks and Security",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The security of wireless sensor networks is an active topic of research where
both symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography issues have been studied. Due to
their computational feasibility on typical sensor nodes, symmetric key
algorithms that use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages have been
intensively studied and perfectly deployed in such environment. Because of the
wireless sensor's limited infrastructure, the bottleneck challenge for
deploying these algorithms is the key distribution. For the same reason of
resources restriction, key distribution mechanisms which are used in
traditional wireless networks are not efficient for sensor networks.
  To overcome the key distribution problem, several key pre-distribution
algorithms and techniques that assign keys or keying material for the networks
nodes in an offline phase have been introduced recently. In this paper, we
introduce a supplemental distribution technique based on the communication
pattern and deployment knowledge modeling. Our technique is based on the
hierarchical grid deployment. For granting a proportional security level with
number of dependent sensors, we use different polynomials in different orders
with different weights. In seek of our proposed work's value, we provide a
detailed analysis on the used resources, resulting security, resiliency, and
connectivity compared with other related works.

weighted least squares). As in the uncensored case, the estimator of the
single-index parameter is seen to have the same asymptotic behavior as in a
fully parametric scheme. We compare these new estimators with those based on
the average derivative technique of Burke and Lu (2005) through a simulation

set an upper limit of 0.05 mag on photometric variations in the {\it V} band
over a time scale of 3 months. The H$\alpha$ line is found to consist of
non-Gaussian profile and quite stable for a duration of 2 months. We have
identified the spectral type of the companion star to be B2 IVe while distance
to the source is estimated to be $\sim$ 4.0 kpc. Along with the optical
observations, we have also carried out analysis of X-ray data from three short
observations of the source, two with the {\it Swift}--XRT and one with the {\it
RXTE}--PCA. We have detected a variation in the absorption column density, from
a value of 22.0 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ immediately after the outburst
down to 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ four months afterwards. In the
quiescent state, the X-ray absorption is consistent with the optical reddening
measurement of E(B - V) = 1.46 mag. From one of the {\it Swift} observations,
during which the X-ray intensity was higher, we have a possible pulse detection
with a period of 469.2 s. For a Be X-ray binary, this indicates an orbital
period in the range of 216--561 days for this binary system.

compressional ($W^s/W^p$) energy ratio in the coda, with an average value of
about 2.8. The ratio between the vertical and horizontal kinetic energies
($V^2/H^2$) can be measured from 5 to 25Hz and shows an abrupt transitionfrom
0.1 in the 5-10Hz band, to about 0.8 in the 15-25Hz band. These measured values
are in sharp contrast with the theoretical prediction for equipartitioned
elastic waves in a homogeneous half-space. To explain these observations, we
have developed a theory of equipartition in a layered elastic half-space. Using
a rigorous spectral decomposition of the elastic wave equation, we define
equipartition as a white noise distributed over the complete set of
eigenfunctions. The theory predicts that close to the resonance frequency of a
low-velocity layer, the ratio between shear and compressional energies strongly
decreases. Using a detailed model of the subsurface at PFO, this
conterintuitive result is found to be in good qualitative and quantitative
agreement with the observations.

representations of Artin-Tits groups of small type, which are of importance
since they are known to be faithful when the type is spherical, or more
generally when restricted to the monoid. If the construction is essentially
unique for a given small and spherical type, the structure of the set of
LK-representations for a given small type is not understood in general. Another
important question is to ask if there exists an analogue of this construction
in the non-small cases ; a first answer is given in [Digne, On the linearity of
Artin Braid groups. J. Algebra 268, (2003) 39-57], where is constructed a
faithful ``twisted'' LK-representation for the spherical, non-small and
crystallographic types. The aim of this paper is to continue the investigations
on those two topics. Regarding the first one, we classify the
LK-representations of the Artin-Tits monoids and groups of small and affine
type. Concerning the second one, we generalize the construction of op.cit. to
any Artin-Tits monoid that appears as the submonoid of fixed points of an
Artin-Tits monoid of small type under the action of graph automorphisms.
