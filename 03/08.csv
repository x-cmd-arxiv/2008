accelerating put in place the last major building block of the present
cosmological model, in which the Universe is composed of 4% baryons, 20% dark
matter, and 76% dark energy. At the same time, it posed one of the most
profound mysteries in all of science, with deep connections to both
astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from the
repulsive gravity of dark energy -- for example, the quantum energy of the
vacuum -- or it may signal that General Relativity breaks down on cosmological
scales and must be replaced. We review the present observational evidence for
cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss the
various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and
describe the key observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in
the coming years.

unaffected by slight inaccuracies in reaction rates. We formalize the

robustness guarantees, stochastic simulation seems to require computational
time proportional to the total number of reaction events. Even if the
concentration (molecular count per volume) stays bounded, the number of
reaction events can be linear in the duration of simulated time and total
molecular count. We show that the behavior of robust systems can be predicted
such that the computational work scales linearly with the duration of simulated
time and concentration, and only polylogarithmically in the total molecular
count. Thus our asymptotic analysis captures the dramatic speedup when
molecular counts are large, and shows that for bounded concentrations the
computation time is essentially invariant with molecular count. Finally, by
noticing that even robust stochastic chemical reaction networks are capable of
embedding complex computational problems, we argue that the linear dependence
on simulated time and concentration is likely optimal.

total area searched equivalent to one square degree. The sample now consists of
56 Type Ia supernovae. The rates we derive are consistent with our results
based on the Cycle 11 observations. In particular, the few detected supernovae
at z>1.4 supports our previous result that there is a drop in the Type Ia
supernova rate at high redshift, suggesting a long time delay between the
formation of the progenitor star and the explosion of the supernova. If
described by a simple one-parameter model, we find a characteristic delay time
of 2-3 Gyr. However, a number of recent results based on e.g., low redshift
supernova samples and supernova host galaxy properties suggest that the
supernova delay time distribution is bimodal. In this model, a major fraction
of the Type Ia supernova rate is 'prompt' and follows the star formation rate,
while a smaller fraction of the rate has a long delay time, making this channel
proportional to mass. While our results are fully consistent with the bimodal
model at low redshifts, the low rate we find at z>1.4 appears to contradict
these results. Models that corrects for star formation hidden by dust may
explain at least part of the differences. Here we discuss this possibility
together with other ways to reconcile data and models.

in stars of G or later spectral types. Presence and level of magnetic activity
depend on star's rotation and rotation itself is strongly influenced by
strength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent
especially useful targets to investigate the connection between rotation and
activity. The open cluster NGC2099 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC
project, which is aimed at exploring the evolution of rotation and magnetic
activity in the late-type members of open clusters of different ages. Time
series CCD photometric observations of this cluster were collected during
January 2004. The relations between activity manifestations, such as the light
curve amplitude, and global stellar parameters are investigated. We have
discovered 135 periodic variables, 122 of which are candidate cluster members.
Determination of rotation periods of G- and K-type stars has allowed us to
better explore evolution of angular momentum at an age of about 500 Myr. A
comparison with the older Hyades cluster (~625 Myr) shows that the newly
determined distribution of rotation periods is consistent with the scenario of
rotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age. However, a
comparison with the younger M34 cluster (~200 Myr) shows that the G8-K5 members
of these clusters have the same rotation period distribution, that is G8-K5
members in NGC2099 seem to have experienced no significant braking in the age
range from ~200 to ~500 Myr. Finally, NGC2099 members have a level of
photospheric magnetic activity, as measured by light curve amplitude, smaller
than in younger stars of same mass and rotation, suggesting that the activity
level also depends on some other age-dependent parameters.

emergence of collective phenomena, intermittent fluctuations and strain
avalanches. In polycrystalline materials, the understanding of plastic
deformation mechanisms depends on grasping the role of grain boundaries on
dislocation motion. Here the interaction of dislocations and elastic, low angle
grain boundaries is studied in the framework of a discrete dislocation
representation. We allow grain boundaries to deform under the effect of
dislocation stress fields and compare the effect of such a perturbation to the
case of rigid grain boudaries. We are able to determine, both analytically and
numerically, corrections to dislocation stress fields acting on neighboring
grains, as mediated by grain boundary deformation. Finally, we discuss
conclusions and consequences for the avalanche statistics, as observed in
polycrystalline samples.

Diffusive shock acceleration is one of the most successful models explaining
the presence of such high-energy particles. We discuss the impact of inverse
Compton losses on the shock acceleration of electrons that takes place in
radiation dominated environments, i.e. in regions where the radiation energy
density exceeds that of the magnetic field. We perform a numerical calculation,
including an energy-loss term in the transport equation of accelerated
particles. We discuss the implications of this effect on the hard X-ray
synchrotron and gamma-ray inverse Compton radiation, produced by
shock-accelerated electrons in young supernova remnants in the presence of
large radiation fields (e.g. in the Galactic centre). We also discuss possible
implications of our results for clusters of galaxies and gamma-ray binaries. We
demonstrate that the inverse Compton losses of electrons, in the Klein-Nishina
regime, lead to spectra of ultra-relativistic electrons that may significantly
differ from classical diffusive shock acceleration solution. The most prominent
feature is the appearance of a pile-up in the spectrum around the cut-off

This state, which lacks a spin gap, is appealing in light of recent experiments
on herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2). Here, we study the properties of this ASL
in more detail, using both the low-energy effective field theory and
Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions. We identify the competing orders of the ASL
-- among them we find a set of magnetic orders lying at the M-points of the
Brillouin zone, the q = 0 magnetic ordered state, the ""Hastings"" valence-bond
solid (VBS) state, and a pattern of vector spin chirality ordering
corresponding to one of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction terms
present in herbertsmithite. We discuss the detection of the magnetic and VBS
competing orders in experiments. While we focus on a clean system without DM
interaction, we consider the effects of small DM interaction and argue that,
surprisingly, it leads to spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry (for DM
interaction that preserves XY spin rotation symmetry, there is also XY magnetic
order). Our analysis of the projected wavefunction provides an estimate of the
""Fermi velocity"" that characterizes all low-energy excitations of the ASL --
this allows us to estimate the specific heat, which compares favorably with
experiments. We also study the spin and bond correlations of the projected
wavefunction and compare these results with those of the effective field
theory. While the spin correlations in the effective field theory and
wavefunction seem to match rather well (although not completely), the bond
correlations are more puzzling. We conclude with a discussion of experiments in
herbertsmithite and make several predictions.

collinear AFM-E orthorhombic manganites is explained by means of
first-principles Wannier functions. We show that the polarization is mainly
determined by the ""asymmetric electron hopping"" of orbitally-polarized Mn eg
states, implicit in the peculiar in-plane zig-zag spin arrangement in the AFM-E
configuration. In ortho-HoMnO3, Wannier function centers are largely displaced
with respect to corresponding ionic positions, implying that the final
polarization is strongly affected by a purely electronic contribution, at
variance with standard ferroelectrics where the ionic-displacement is dominant.
However, the final value of the polarization is the result of competing
effects, as shown by the opposite signs of the contributions to the
polarization coming from the Mn eg and t2g states. Furthermore, a systematic
analysis of the link between ferroelectricity and the spin, orbital and lattice
degrees of freedom in the manganite series has been carried out, in the aim of
ascertaining chemical trends as a function of the rare-earth ion. Our results
show that the Mn-O-Mn angle is the key quantity in determining the exchange
coupling: upon decreasing the Mn-O-Mn angle, the first- (second-) nearest
neighbor ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) interaction decreases (remains
constant), in turn stabilizing either the AFM-A or the AFM-E spin configuration
for weakly or strongly distorted manganites, respectively. The Mn eg
contribution to the polarization dramatically increases with the Mn-O-Mn angle
and decreases with the ""long"" Mn-O bond length, whereas the Mn t2g contribution
decreases with the ""short"" Mn-O bond-length, partially cancelling the former
term.

distributed across the entire sky (including Orion), none of our objects are in
a high stellar density environment. The binary separation distribution changes
significantly during the Class I phase, and the binary frequency at separations
greater than 1000 AU declines steadily with respect to spectral index. Despite
these changes, the binary frequency remains constant until the end of the Class
I phase, when it drops sharply. We propose a scenario to account for the
changes in the Class I binary separation distribution. This scenario postulates
that companions with a separation greater than ~1000 AU were ejected during the
Class 0 phase, but remain gravitationally bound due to the mass of the
envelope. As the envelope dissipates, these companions become unbound and the
binary frequency at wide separations declines. This scenario predicts that a
large number of Class 0 objects should be non-hierarchical multiple systems,
and that many Class I YSOs with a widely separated companion should also have a
very close companion. We also find that Class I protostars are not dynamically
pristine, and have experienced dynamical evolution before they are visible as
Class I objects. For the first time, evidence is presented showing that the
Class I binary frequency and the binary separation distribution strongly depend

Solar Blind Channel of the ACS on HST in the F122M (Lya on-line) and F140LP

modeling of both the stellar and nebular continua, facilitated by supporting
HST imaging in Ha and 5 continuum bands, combined with Starburst99 evolutionary
synthesis models, and prescriptions for dust extinction on the continuum. In
all, the resulting morphologies in Lya, Ha, and UV-continuum are qualitatively
very different and we show that the bulk of Lya emerges in a diffuse component
resulting from resonant scattering events. Lya escape fractions, computed from
integrated Ha luminosities and recombination theory, are found never to exceed
14%. Internal dust extinction is estimated in each pixel and used to correct
Lya fluxes. However, the extinction corrections are far too small (factors from
2.6 to infinity) to reconcile the global Lya luminosities with recombination
theory. Surprisingly, when comparing the global equivalent widths of Lya and
Ha, the two quantities appear anti-correlated, which may be due to the
evolution of mechanical feedback. This calls for caution in the interpretation
of Lya observations. The images presented have a physical resolution 3 orders
of magnitude better than attainable at high-z from the ground with current
instrumentation and our images may therefore serve as useful templates for
comparing with observations and modeling of primeval galaxy formation. We
therefore provide the reduced Lya, Ha, and continuum images to the community.

in the Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line using the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) of
the ACS onboard the HST. Observations have been obtained in Lya and H-alpha
(Ha) and 6 continuum filters between ~1500AA and the I-band. Previously (Hayes
et al 2005) we demonstrated that the production of Lya line-only images in the
SBC-only data-set is non-trivial and that supporting data is a requirement. We
here develop various methods of continuum subtraction and assess their relative
performance using a variety of spectral energy distributions (SED) as input. We
conclude that simple assumptions about the behavior of the ultraviolet
continuum consistently lead to results that are wildly erroneous, and determine
that an SED fitting approach is essential. Moreover, a single component stellar
or stellar+nebular spectrum is not always sufficient for realistic template
SEDs and, in order to successfully recover the input observables, care must be
taken to control contributions of nebular gas and underlying stellar
populations. Independent measurements of the metallicity must first be
obtained, but details of the initial mass function play only a small role. We
identify the need to bin together pixels in our data to obtain signal-to-noise
(S/N) of ~10 in each band before processing. At S/N=10 we can recover Lya
fluxes accurate to ~30% for Lya lines with intrinsic equivalent width [W(Lya)]
of 10AA. This accuracy improves to ~10% for W(Lya)=100AA. We describe the image
processing applied to the observations presented in \""Ostlin et al. (2009) and
the associated data-release. We also present simulations for an observing

in the channel, here the existence of side information at the receiver is used.
Both coded and uncoded side information are considered. In the coded side

availability of the legitimate receiver's and the eavesdropper's side

motivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can be
used to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from large
redshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data to
reconstruct the cosmic density field in the local universe. Our reconstruction
method starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold.
Each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest halo
according to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of the
halo. The distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a given
mass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matter
haloes and the mass distribution within their domains. We use N-body

simulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accurately
using haloes with masses down to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$ (above which samples of
galaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys of
galaxies). Working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshift
distortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in an

complex organic molecules in star-forming regions. However, recent experimental
and theoretical evidence has cast doubt on the efficiency of such processes.
Grain-surface chemistry is frequently invoked as a solution, but until now
there have been no quantitative models taking into account both the high degree
of chemical complexity and the evolving physical conditions of star-forming
regions. Here, we introduce a new gas-grain chemical network, wherein a wide
array of complex species may be formed by reactions involving radicals. The
radicals we consider (H, OH, CO, HCO, CH3, CH3O, CH2OH, NH and NH2) are
produced primarily by cosmic ray-induced photodissociation of the granular ices
formed during the colder, earlier stages of evolution. The gradual warm-up of
the hot core is crucial to the formation of complex molecules, allowing the
more strongly-bound radicals to become mobile on grain surfaces. This type of
chemistry is capable of reproducing the high degree of complexity seen in Sgr
B2(N), and can explain the observed abundances and temperatures of a variety of
previously detected complex organic molecules, including structural isomers.
Many other complex species are predicted by this model, and several of these
species may be detectable in hot cores. Differences in the chemistry of high-
and low-mass star-formation are also addressed; greater chemical complexity is
expected where evolution timescales are longer.

converges to the solution of Navier-Stokes equations on any finite interval

$O(\frac{1}{N})$ times its original energy as $t \to \infty$. Hence the limit
$N \to \infty$ and $T\to \infty$ do not commute. For general flows, we only
provide a lower bound to this effect. In the special case of shear flows, we

brightness oscillations of the Sun resulting from global solar oscillations are
presented. This has been done for a broad range of the visible and infrared
continuum spectrum. The procedure for the calculations of these functions
includes the numerical computation of depth-dependent derivatives of the
opacity caused by p modes in the photosphere. A radiative-transport code was
used for this purpose to get the disturbances of the opacities from temperature
and density fluctuations. The visibility and darkening functions are obtained
for adiabatic oscillations under the assumption that the temperature
disturbances are proportional to the undisturbed temperature of the
photosphere. The latter assumption is the only way to explore any opacity
effects since the eigenfunctions of p-mode oscillations have not been obtained
so far. This investigation reveals that opacity effects have to be taken into
account because they dominate the violet and infrared part of the spectrum.
Because of this dominance, the visibility functions are negative for those
parts of the spectrum. Furthermore, the darkening functions show a
wavelength-dependent change of sign for some wavelengths owing to these opacity
effects. However, the visibility and darkening functions under the assumptions
used contradict the observations of global p-mode oscillations, but it is
beyond doubt that the opacity effects influence the brightness fluctuations of
the Sun resulting from global oscillations.

the single t-quark production at the Hadron colliders, specially at the LHC.
The TC2 model can contribute to the cross section of the single t-quark
production in two different ways. First, the existence of the top-pions and
top-higgs can modify the $Wtb$ coupling via their loop contributions, and such
modification can cause the correction to the cross sections of all three
production modes. Our study shows that this kind of correction is negative and
very small in all cases. Thus it is difficult to observe such correction even
at the LHC. On the other hand, there exist the tree-level FC couplings in the
TC2 model which can also contribute to the cross sections of the $tq$ and
$t\bar{b}$ production processes. The resonant effect can greatly enhance the
cross sections of the $tq$ and $t\bar{b}$ productions. The first evidence of
the single t-quark production has been reported by the $D0$ collaboration and
the measured cross section for the single t-quark production of
$\sigma(p\bar{p}\to tb+X,tqb+X)$ is compatible at the 10% level with the
standard model prediction. Because the light top-pion can make great
contribution to the $t\bar{b}$ production, the top-pion mass should be very
large in order to make the predicted cross section in the TC2 model be
consistent with the Tevatron experiments. More detailed information about the
top-pion mass and the FC couplings in the TC2 model should be obtained with the
running of the LHC.

appears to penetrates deep below base of the convective envelope and at outer
part of the radiative zone. With such a deep flow velocity below the convective
envelope and a very high density stratification in the outer part of the
radiative zone with likely existence of a strong ($\sim$ $10^{4}$ G) toroidal
magnetic field structure, the velocity of transport of meridional flow is
considerably reduced. Hence, it is very unlikely that the return flow will
reach the surface (with a period of solar cycle) as required by some of the
flux transport dynamo models. On the other hand, deep meridional flow is
required for burning of Lithium at outer part of the radiative zone supporting
the observed Lithium deficiency at the surface.

particle physics research, and apply this thinking to the case of Hidden
Worlds. I focus on one of the simplest representative cases of a Hidden World,
and detail the rich implications it has for LHC physics, including universal
suppression of Higgs boson production, trans-TeV heavy Higgs boson signatures,
heavy-to-light Higgs boson decays, weakly coupled exotic gauge bosons, and
Higgs boson decays to four fermions via light exotic gauge bosons. Some
signatures may be accessible in the very early stages of collider operation,
whereas others motivate a later high-lumonosity upgrade.

30 moves (15 by each player) [Martin Gardner, Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor
Ciphers, MAA, 1997]. This solution requires that the two players cooperate to
generate a win as quickly as possible for one of them. We show, using
computational search techniques, that no shorter game is possible. We also
consider a solitaire version of Chinese Checkers where one player attempts to
move her pieces across the board in as few moves as possible. In 1971, Octave
Levenspiel found a solution in 27 moves [Ibid.]; we demonstrate that no shorter
solution exists. To show optimality, we employ a variant of A* search, as well
as bidirectional search.

B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.78.115318",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The layer interdependence of transport in an undoped electron-hole bilayer
(uEHBL) device was studied as a function of carrier density, interlayer
electric field, and temperature. The uEHBL device consisted of a density
tunable, independently contacted two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and
two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) induced via field effect in distinct GaAs
quantum wells separated by a 30 nm Al$_{0.9}$Ga$_{0.1}$As barrier. Transport
measurements were made simultaneously on each layer using the van der Pauw
method. An increase in 2DHG mobility with increasing 2DEG density was observed,
while the 2DEG mobility showed negligible dependence on the 2DHG density.
Decreasing the interlayer electric-field and thereby increasing interlayer
separation also increased the 2DHG mobility with negligible effects on the 2DEG
mobility. The change in interlayer separation as interlayer electric-field
changed was estimated using 2DHG Coulomb drag measurements. The results were
consistent with mobility of each layer being only indirectly dependent on the
adjacent layer density and dominated by background impurity scattering.
Temperature dependencies were also determined for the resistivity of each
layer.
