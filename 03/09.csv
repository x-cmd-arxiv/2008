modeling in Fourier space of the physical structures predicted by models, we
constrain the circumstellar envelope parameters for four Class 0 young stellar
objects, as well as their embedded circumstellar disks. The envelopes of these
objects are still undergoing collapse, and theoretical collapse models can be
compared to the observations. Since it has been suggested in a previous study
that both the Larson-Penston and Shu similarity solutions underestimate the age
of the system, we adopt Tassis & Mouschovias' model of the collapse process,
which includes all relevant magnetic fields effects. The results of the model
fitting show a good consistency between theory and data; furthermore, no age
problem exists since the Tassis & Mouschovias' model is age independent for the
first 255 kyr. Although the majority of the continuum dust emission arises from
the circumstellar envelopes, these objects have well known outflows, which
suggest the presence of circumstellar disks. At the highest resolution, most of
the large-scale envelope emission is resolved out by interferometry, but the
small-scale residual emission remains, making it difficult to observe only the
compact disk component. By modeling the emission of the envelope and
subtracting it from the total emission, we constrain the disk masses in our
four systems to be comparable to or smaller than the typical disk masses for T
Tauri systems.

inclination-corrected location on the color-magnitude diagram, and apparent

each of these parameters and enables simple boundaries to be drawn that
delineate three different galaxy populations: Early-type galaxies, which are
red, highly concentrated, and round; Late-type galaxies, which are blue, have
low concentrations, and are disk dominated; and Intermediate-type galaxies,
which are red, have intermediate concentrations, and have disks. We have
validated our method by comparing to visual classifications of high-quality
imaging data from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The inclination correction
is crucial to unveiling the previously unrecognized Intermediate class.
Intermediate-type galaxies, roughly corresponding to lenticulars and early
spirals, lie on the red sequence. The red sequence is therefore composed of two
distinct morphological types, suggesting that there are two distinct mechanisms
for transiting to the red sequence. We propose that Intermediate-type galaxies
are those that have lost their cold gas via strangulation, while Early-type
galaxies are those that have experienced a major merger that either consumed
their cold gas, or whose merger progenitors were already devoid of cold gas
(the ``dry merger'' scenario).

measurements are carried out at eight values of the Wilson hopping parameter
$\kappa$ in the range 0.156 - 0.158 corresponding to PCAC quark mass values
$am_q$ from about 0.07 to below 0.015. We analyze the static potential by
fitting to the familiar phenomenological form and extract $a/r_c$. Though
scaling violations may indeed be present for relatively large $am_q$, a
consistent scenario at sufficiently small $am_q$ seems to emerge in the
mass-independent scheme where for a fixed $\beta$, $1/r_0$ and $\sqrt{\sigma}$
have linear dependence on $m_q$ as physical effects similar to the quark mass
dependence of the rho mass. We present evidence for this scenario and
accordingly extract the lattice scale $a$ by chiral extrapolation to the
physical point. Care has been exercised to determine optimal values of all
fitting parameters and accuracy of the chiral extrapolation. An independent
determination of the scale $a$ by chiral extrapolation of the rho mass is
consistent with the scale obtained above ($a$ = 0.08041(12)(77) fm, $a^{-1}$ =

extremely long calculation by exterior derivatives with remarkable

equations. Therefore, exterior differentiating sufficiently many times should
gather us enough information for the conclusion. In spite of its elementary
nature, the magnitude of the calculation and the surprisingly pleasant
cancellations make it desirable to understand the underlying geometric
principles.

Consequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor
statistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the
physics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and
selection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The
selected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a
planet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had
remained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities
would be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the
planetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1
Eri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact
that the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single
temperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting
regions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger
than the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are
considerably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is
extended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU. Therefore, a
physically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 K),
located at 300 AU from the star and about 60 AU wide. The minimum mass of 0.04
Mearth (3 Mmoon) of 1 mm-size icy ring-particles is considerable, given the

molecules is investigated in terms of mean-field Lagrangian density. We find
that the STIRAP technique aided by Feshbach resonance is more effective than
the bare Fechbach resonance for $^6$Li atoms rather than $^{40}$K atoms. We
also make general consideration on the symmetry and its relevant conservation
law, which enable us to introduce a natural definition of adiabatic fidelity
for CPT state. The calculated values of the fidelity then provide an
interpretation on why the conversion efficiencies for $^{40}$K and $^6$Li are
distinctly different.

framework of the general method for solving gauge models with high symmetries.
This exact algebraical approach - proposed several years ago by one of us - was
designed to include a minimal Higgs mechanism that spontaneously breaks the
gauge symmetry up to the universal $U(1)_{em}$ electromagnetic one and,
consequently, to supply the mass spectrum and the couplings of the currents for
all the particles in the model. We prove in this paper that this powerful tool,
when is applied to the PPF 3-3-1 model, naturally recovers the whole Standard
Model phenomenology and, in addition, predicts - since a proper parametrization
is employed - viable results such as: (i) the exact expressions for the boson
and fermion masses, (ii) the couplings of the charged and neutral currents and
(iii) a plausible neutrino mass pattern. A generalized Weinberg transformation
is implemented, while the mixing between the neutral bosons $Z$ and
$Z^{\prime}$ is performed as a necessary step by the method itself. Some
phenomenological consequences are also sketched, including the strange
possibility that simultaneously $m(Z)=m(Z^{\prime})$ and $m(W)=m(V)$ hold.

  surfaces in the complements of algebraically alternating knots and links","15 pages, 15figures",,,,"math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $F$ be an incompressible, meridionally incompressible and not
boundary-parallel surface with boundary in the complement of an algebraic
tangle $(B,T)$. Then $F$ separates the strings of $T$ in $B$ and the boundary
slope of $F$ is uniquely determined by $(B,T)$ and hence we can define the
slope of the algebraic tangle. In addition to the Conway's tangle sum, we
define a natural product of two tangles. The slopes and binary operation on
algebraic tangles lead an algebraic structure which is isomorphic to the
rational numbers.
  We introduce a new knot and link class, algebraically alternating knots and
links, roughly speaking which are constructed from alternating knots and links
by replacing some crossings with algebraic tangles. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a closed surface to be incompressible and meridionally
incompressible in the complement of an algebraically alternating knot or link
$K$, in particular we show that if $K$ is a knot, then the complement of $K$
does not contain such a surface.

arising in the framework of Special Theory of Relativity as the spatial
rotation resulting from two subsequence Lorentz boosts. The final result for
the orthogonal matrix of Thomas precession is given by Eqs. (21)--(25). A
trivial calculation leads to the compact formula (26) for the angle of rotation
due to Thomas precession.
  In the framework of Gaia the special-relativistic Thomas precession is an
important step in the derivation of an aberrational formula with the
Mansouri-Sexl parameters. The latter formula will be used to test the Local
Lorentz Invariance with Gaia data as will be explained elsewhere.

filamentary structures are given and compared to previous surveys of the
region. Eight of the unusual, nonthermal radio filaments are detected in 6 cm
polarized emission; three of these are the first such detections, confirming
their nonthermal nature. This survey found emission from a filament at
(l,b)=(359.1,0.75), or a projected distance from Sgr A* of 200 pc, greatly
extending the latitude range observed with such features. There is also new
evidence for spatial gradients in the 6/20 cm spectral indices of some
filaments and we discuss models for these gradients. In studying compact
sources, the combination of spectral index and polarization information allows
us to identify pulsar candidates and compact HII regions in the survey. There
is also some evidence that the flux measurements of compact sources may be
affected by electron scattering from the interstellar medium in the cent ral
few hundred parsecs of the Galaxy.
