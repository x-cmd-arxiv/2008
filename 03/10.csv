Charge expulsion results in a macroscopically inhomogeneous charge distribution

expected to exist. Furthermore, we have recently shown that a dynamical
explanation of the Meissner effect in superconductors leads to the prediction
that a spontaneous spin current exists near the surface of superconductors. In
this paper we extend the electrodynamic equations proposed earlier for the
charge density and charge current to describe also the space and time
dependence of the spin density and spin current. This allows us to determine
the magnitude of the expelled negative charge and interior electric field as
well as of the spin current in terms of other measurable properties of

We demonstrate our technique given a mock galaxy cluster similar to Abell 1689

images. We also explore cases in which far fewer multiple images are observed,
such as four multiple images of a single galaxy. Massmap solutions are never
unique, and our method makes it possible to explore an extremely flexible range
of physical (and unphysical) solutions, all of which perfectly reproduce the
data given. Each reconfiguration of the source galaxies produces a new massmap
solution. An optimization routine is provided to find those source positions
(and redshifts, within uncertainties) which produce the ""most physical"" massmap
solution, according to a new figure of merit developed here. Our method imposes
no assumptions about the slope of the radial profile nor mass following light.
But unlike ""non-parametric"" grid-based methods, the number of free parameters
we solve for is only as many as the number of observable constraints (or
slightly greater if fluxes are constrained). For each set of source positions
and redshifts, massmap solutions are obtained ""instantly"" via direct matrix
inversion by smoothly interpolating the deflection field using a recently

cosmological model. We propose a new cosmological system of units, including a
cosmological Planck constant that absorbs the well known large number 10120.
With this new Planck constant no large numbers appear at the cosmological
level. They appear at lower levels, e.g. at the quantum world. We note here
that Zeldovich formula, for the cosmological constant, is equivalent to the
Weinberg relation. The immediate conclusion is that the speed of light c must
be proportional to the Hubble parameter H, and therefore decrease with time. We
find that the gravitational radius of the Universe and its size are one and the
same constant (Mach principle). The usual cosmological omega parameters for
mass, lambda and curvature turn out to be all constants of order one. The
anthropic principle is not necessary in this theory. It is shown that a factor
of 1061converts in this theory a Planck fluctuation (a quantum black hole) into
a cosmological quantum black hole: the Universe today. General relativity and
quantum mechanics give the same local solution of an expanding Universe with

transition to a disordered stripe phase just below room temperature, which
alters the topology of the electrical conduction pathways.

flux models (Predeshensky/Milinski 1971) and cellular automata models

reliability, there is no agreement on the repulsive forces, not even on the
functional form of these forces (Lakoba 2005, Molnar 1996, Parisi 2005, Yu

repulsive forces have to depend not only on the relative position of persons,

observations of people moving, although the large scatter of data and the

the critical $U$ and modify the shape of transition lines. Moreover, they lead
to very different physical properties of the metallic and insulating phases
near the transition, in particular in the region of the phase diagram where the
two solutions coexist. Approaching the transition from the metallic side, we
find an anomalous metallic state with very low coherence scale at temperatures
as low as $T=0.01t$. The insulating state is characterized by the relatively
narrow Mott gap with pronounced peaks at the gap edge.

Sub-millisecond pulsars, if detected, would play an essential and important
role in distinguishing quark stars from neutron stars. A key question is how
sub-millisecond pulsars could form. Both sub-Keplerian (for neutron and quark
stars) and super-Keplerian cases (only for quark stars, which are bound
additionally by strong interaction) have been discussed in this paper in order
to investigate possible ways of forming sub-millisecond pulsars. In the
sub-Keplerian case, the equilibrium periods of both neutron and quark stars
could be as low as ~0.4 ms when they are spun up through accretion in binary
systems. In the super-Keplerian case, pulsars could very likely have an initial
period of ~0.1 ms if quark stars with different mass could be formed from
accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs. The timescale for a
sub-millisecond pulsar to keep its period <1 ms is restricted due to
gravitational wave radiation. We found that the timescales of neutron stars
within sub-millisecond periods are approximately ~10 yr, but the timescales
estimated (>10 Myr) for low-mass quark stars could be long enough for us to
detect.

how the tunneling parameter changes with the length scale. This leads to a

between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. A single passage from $h \to - \infty$ to $h
\to +\infty$ or the other way around is referred to as a half-period of
quenching. For an even number of half-periods, the transverse field is brought
back to the initial value of $-\infty$; in the case of an odd number of
half-periods, the dynamics is stopped at $h \to +\infty$. The density of
defects produced due to the non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping
the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener problem and is generally
found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ for large $\tau$; however, the magnitude is
found to depend on the number of half-periods of quenching. For two successive
half-periods, the defect density is found to decrease in comparison to a single
half-period, suggesting the existence of a corrective mechanism in the reverse
path. A similar behavior of the density of defects and the local entropy is
observed for repeated quenching. The defect density decays as $1/{\sqrt\tau}$
for large $\tau$ for any number of half-periods, and shows a increase in kink
density for small $\tau$ for an even number; the entropy shows qualitatively
the same behavior for any number of half-periods. The probability of
non-adiabatic transitions and the local entropy saturate to 1/2 and $\ln 2$,

really understood, is the very non-linear nature of the flow rule relating
stresses and strain rates. Using a microfluidic velocimetry technique, we
characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in
gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughness. Beyond the
classical non-linearities of the rheological behaviour, we evidence finite size
effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule.
In contrast, a rather simple non-local flow rule is shown to account for all
the velocity profiles. This non-locality of the dynamics is quantified by a
length, characteristic of the cooperativity of the flow at these scales, that
is unobservable in the liquid state (lower concentrations) and that increases
with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for
applications involving thin layers, e.g. coatings, our assessment of
non-locality and cooperativity echoes observations on other glassy, jammed and
granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.

The amplitudes of the induced toroidal magnetic fields are limited from above

its distinct dependence on the {\em sign} of the magnetic field. We find for
fast rotation that positive (negative) Hall parameters essentially reduce
(increase) the stability domain. It is thus concluded that the toroidal field
belts in PNS induced by their differential rotation should have different
amplitudes in both hemispheres which later are frozen in. Due to the effect of
magnetic suppression of the heat conductivity also the brightness of the two
hemispheres should be different. As a possible example for our scenario the

different X-ray brightness at both hemispheres.

understanding of quantum parallelism is important both for theoretical and
applied research, cf. e.g. David Deutsch \cite{DD}. We present a realistic
interpretation based on recently developed prequantum classical statistical
field theory (PCSFT). In the PCSFT-approach to QM quantum states (mixed as well
as pure) are labels of special ensembles of classical fields. Thus e.g. a
single (!) ``electron in the pure state'' $\psi$ can be identified with a
special `` electron random field,'' say $\Phi_\psi(\phi).$ Quantum computer
operates with such random fields. By one computational step for e.g. a Boolean
function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ the initial random field $\Phi_{\psi_0}(\phi)$ is
transformed into the final random field $\Phi_{\psi_f}(\phi)$ ``containing all
values'' of $f.$ This is the objective of quantum computer's ability to operate
quickly with huge amounts of information -- in fact, with classical random
fields.

insolubility of the free-will problem are several popular but strongly
metaphysical notions and hypotheses. To reduce the metaphysics, some ideas are
borrowed from physics. A concept of event causality is discussed. The
importance of Hume's Principle of Causality is stressed and his Principle of
Causation is weakened. The key concept of the paper, the so-called relative
freedom, is also suggested by physics. It is a kind of freedom that can be
observed everywhere in nature. Turning to biology, incomplete knowledge is
defined for all organisms. They cope with the problem by Popper's trial and
error processes. One source of their success is the relative freedom of choice
from the basic option ranges: mutations, motions and neural connections.
Finally, the conjecture is adopted that communicability can be used as a
criterion of consciousness and free will is defined as a conscious version of
relative freedom. The resulting notion is logically self-consistent and it
describes an observable phenomenon that agrees with our experience.

1/4T to a=1/6T and 1/8T, we find that screening correlators change little, in
contrast with the situation for other types of lattice fermions. All
correlators are close to the ideal gas prediction at small separations. The
long distance falloff is clearly exponential, showing that a parametrization by
a single screening length is possible at distances z > 1/T. The correlator
corresponding to the thermal vector is close to the ideal gas value at all
distances, whereas that for the thermal scalar deviates at large distances.
This is examined through the screening lengths and momentum space correlators.
There is strong evidence that the screening transfer matrix does not have

source; (ii) a total dust production rate Q_dust equal to about 86 kg.s^-1 and
a parameter Afrho equal to 10,000cm; (iii) no emission lines (CN and C_2) can
be detected in the visible range; (iv) the upper limits for the CN and C_2
production rates are about 3.8x10^25 and 10^26 molecules.s^-1 respectively; (v)
we detected no Echeclus' satellite before the outburst up to M_R equal to about
26; (vi) the upper limit for the object generating the coma is about 8 km in
diameter; (vii) and we detected no cometary activity one year later, in March

chemical and biochemical fields (interstellar chemistry, prebiotic chemistry,
reaction mechanism, etc). In this article, we propose to simultaneously refine
and extend for general chemical reaction systems the formalism initially
introduced for the description of metabolic networks. The classical approaches
through the computation of the right null space leads to the decomposition of
the network into complex ``cycles'' of reactions concerned with all
metabolites. We show how, departing from the left null space computation, the
flux analysis can be decoupled into linear fluxes and single loops, allowing a
more refine qualitative analysis as a function of the antagonisms and
connections among these local fluxes. This analysis is made possible by the
decomposition of the molecules into elementary subunits, called ""reactons"" and
the consequent decomposition of the whole network into simple first order unary
partial reactions related with simple transfers of reactons from one molecule

our method by converting a general form of pixel-space approach into spherical

harmonic space, spatial variability of linear weights is incorporated in a
self-contained manner and our linear weights are continuous functions of
position over the entire sky. The full correspondence to pixel-space approach
enables straightforward physical interpretation on our approach. In variance
minimization of a linear combination map, the existence of a cross term between
residual foregrounds and CMB makes the linear combination of minimum variance
differ from that of minimum foreground. We have developed an iterative
foreground reduction method, where perturbative correction is made for the
cross term. Our CMB map derived from the WMAP data is in better agreement with
the WMAP best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model than the WMAP team's Internal Linear

inhomogeneous cosmologies, we contemplate on the question whether it is
sensible to assume that curvature averages out on some scale of homogeneity, as
implied by the standard concordance model of cosmology, or whether the averaged
scalar curvature can be largely negative today, as required for an explanation
of Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. We confront both conjectures with a
detailed analysis of the kinematical backreaction term and estimate its
strength for a multi-scale inhomogeneous matter and curvature distribution. Our
main result is a formula for the spatially averaged scalar curvature involving
quantities that are all measurable on regional (i.e. up to 100 Mpc) scales. We
propose strategies to quantitatively evaluate the formula, and pinpoint the
assumptions implied by the conjecture of a small or zero averaged curvature. We
reach the conclusion that the standard concordance model needs fine-tuning in
the sense of an assumed equipartition law for curvature in order to reconcile
it with the estimated properties of the averaged physical space, whereas a
negative averaged curvature is favoured, independent of the prior on the value
of the cosmological constant.

investigate the properties of Tycho's SNR and their correspondence to the
existing experimental data. It is demonstrated that the large mean ratio
between the radii of the contact discontinuity and the forward shock is
consistent with the very effective acceleration of nuclear energetic particles
at the forward shock. It is also argued that consistency of the value E_{sn} =
1.2x10^{51} erg with the gas dynamics, acceleration theory, and the existing
gamma-ray measurements requires the source distance to be greater than 3.3 kpc.
The corresponding ambient gas number density is lower than 0.4 cm^{-3}. Since
the expected gamma-ray flux strongly depends on the source distance,
F_{\gamma}\propto d^{-7}, a future experimental determination of the actual
gamma-ray flux from Tycho's SNR will make it possible to determine the values
of the source distance and of the mean ambient gas density. A simple inverse
Compton model without a dominant population of nuclear CRs is not compatible
with the present upper limit for the gamma-ray emission for any reasonable
ambient interstellar B-field. Given the consistency between acceleration theory
and overall, as well as internal, gas dynamics, a future gamma-ray detection
would make the case for nuclear particle acceleration in Tycho's SNR

and Gaussianity and apply it to the WMAP CMB foreground reduced, temperature
maps, and cross-channel difference maps. We divide the sky into regions of
varying size and shape and measure the first four moments of the one-point
distribution within these regions, and using their simulated spatial
distributions we test the statistical isotropy and Gaussianity hypotheses. By
randomly varying orientations of these regions, we sample the underlying CMB
field in a new manner, that offers a richer exploration of the data content,
and avoids possible biasing due to a single choice of sky division. The
statistical significance is assessed via comparison with realistic Monte-Carlo
simulations.
  We find the three-year WMAP maps to agree well with the isotropic, Gaussian
random field simulations as probed by regions corresponding to the angular
scales ranging from 6 deg to 30 deg at 68% confidence level. We report a
strong, anomalous (99.8% CL) dipole ``excess'' in the V band of the three-year
WMAP data and also in the V band of the WMAP five-year data (99.3% CL). We
notice the large scale hemispherical power asymmetry, and find that it is not
highly statistically significant in the WMAP three-year data (<~ 97%) at scales
l <= 40. The significance is even smaller if multipoles up to l=1024 are
considered (~90% CL). We give constraints on the amplitude of the
previously-proposed CMB dipole modulation field parameter. We easily detect the
residual foregrounds in cross-band difference maps at rms level <~ 7 \mu K (at
scales >~ 6 deg) and limit the systematical uncertainties to <~ 1.7 \mu K (at
scales >~ 30 deg).

segmentation plays a key role in most computerized systems. Our technique is a
gradient-based one, showing the main characteristic that no free parameters
have been evaluated on the dataset used in this analysis, thus it can directly
be applied to datasets acquired in different conditions without any ad-hoc
modification. A dataset of 226 masses (109 malignant and 117 benign) has been
used in this study. The segmentation algorithm works with a comparable
efficiency both on malignant and benign masses. Sixteen features based on
shape, size and intensity of the segmented masses are analyzed by a
multi-layered perceptron neural network. A feature selection procedure has been
carried out on the basis of the feature discriminating power and of the linear
correlations interplaying among them. The comparison of the areas under the ROC
curves obtained by varying the number of features to be classified has shown
that 12 selected features out of the 16 computed ones are powerful enough to
achieve the best classifier performances. The radiologist assigned the
segmented masses to three different categories: correctly-, acceptably- and
non-acceptably-segmented masses. We initially estimated the area under ROC
curve only on the first category of segmented masses (the 88.5% of the

measurable observables to relevant elements of the algebras, usually the

there is place for some arbitrary conventions. The situation is much more
involved in the context of quantum algebras, where inside the quantum universal
enveloping algebra, we have not enough primitive elements that allow for a
privileged set of generators and all basic sets are equivalent. In this paper
we discuss how the Drinfeld double structure underlying every simple Lie
bialgebra characterizes uniquely a particular basis without any freedom,
completing the Cartan program on simple algebras. By means of a perturbative
construction, a distinguished deformed basis (we call it the analytical basis)
is obtained for every quantum group as the analytical prolongation of the above
defined Lie basis of the corresponding Lie bialgebra. It turns out that the
whole construction is unique, so to each quantum universal enveloping algebra
is associated one and only one bialgebra. In this way the problem of the
classification of quantum algebras is moved to the classification of
bialgebras. In order to make this procedure more clear, we discuss in detail

dynamics of colloidal particles in a shear flow. Combining X-ray techniques
with microfluidics is an experimental strategy that reduces the risk of x-ray
induced beam damage and also allows time-resolved studies of processes taking
place in flowcells. The experimental results and theoretical predictions
presented here, show that in the low shear limit, for a ``transverse flow''
scattering geometry (scattering wave vector q perpendicular to the direction of
flow) the measured relaxation times are independent of the flow rate and
determined only by the diffusive motion of the particles. This is not generally
valid and in particular, for a ``longitudinal flow'' (q || flow) scattering
geometry, the relaxation times are strongly affected by the flow-induced motion
of the particles. Our results show that the Brownian diffusion of colloidal
particles can be measured in a flowing sample and that, up to flux limitations,
the experimental conditions under which this is possible are easier to achieve
at higher values of q.

Mo for a distance of 500 pc. The mass and (relatively low) luminosity of the

possible in evolved stars. Gomez's Hamburger is probably a transitional object

and redshift is studied.
  We inspected 51 spectroscopically classified type II QSO candidates from the
XMM-Newton Marano field survey, the XMM-Newton-2dF wide angle survey (XWAS),
and the AXIS survey to set-up a well-defined sample with secure optical type II
identifications. Fourteen type II QSOs were classified and an X-ray spectral
analysis performed. Since most of our sources have only ~40 X-ray counts
(PN-detector), we carefully studied the fit results of the simulated X-ray
spectra as a function of fit statistic and binning method. We determined that
fitting the spectra with the Cash-statistic and a binning of minimum one count
per bin recovers the input values of the simulated X-ray spectra best. Above
100 PN counts, the free fits of the spectrum's slope and absorbing hydrogen
column density are reliable.
  We find only moderate absorption (N_H=(2-10) x 10^22 cm^-2) and no obvious
trends with redshift and intrinsic X-ray luminosity. In a few cases a
Compton-thick absorber cannot be excluded. Two type II objects with no X-ray
absorption were discovered. We find no evidence for an intrinsic separation
between type II AGN and high X-ray luminosity type II QSO in terms of
absorption. The stacked X-ray spectrum of our 14 type II QSOs shows no iron
K-alpha line. In contrast, the stack of the 8 type II AGN reveals a very
prominent iron K-alpha line at an energy of ~ 6.6 keV and an EW ~ 2 keV.

The origin of the multimode pulsation can be traced to one of the two different
mechanisms: either to the non-resonant coupling of the two excited modes
(double-mode pulsation) or to the 2omega_1 = omega_0 + omega_2 parametric
resonance (triple-mode pulsation). In case of delta Cephei models, a
triple-mode pulsation domain, connected with the 2:1 resonance, 2omega_0 =

ground-state configurations of interacting particle systems in various space
dimensions so that the scattering of radiation exactly matches a prescribed
pattern for a set of wave vectors. We show that the constructed ground states
are, counterintuitively, disordered (i.e., possess no long-range order) in the
infinite-volume limit. We focus on three classes of configurations with unique
radiation scattering characteristics: (i)``stealth'' materials, which are
transparent to incident radiation at certain wavelengths; (ii)``super-ideal''
gases, which scatter radiation identically to that of an ensemble of ideal gas
configurations for a selected set of wave vectors; and (iii)``equi-luminous''
materials, which scatter radiation equally intensely for a selected set of wave
vectors. We find that ground-state configurations have an increased tendency to
contain clusters of particles as one increases the prescribed luminosity.
Limitations and consequences of this procedure are detailed.

exchange benefits, then the network's capacity to use energy is scaled by the
average amount of energy required to connect any two of its nodes. The scaling
factor equals \textit{e}, and the network's entropy is $\ln(n)$. Networking
emerges in consequence of nodes minimizing the ratio of their energy use to the
benefits obtained for such use, and their connectability. Networking leads to
nested hierarchical clustering, which multiplies a network's capacity to use
its energy to benefit its nodes. Network entropy multiplies a node's capacity.
For a real network in which the nodes have the capacity to exchange benefits,
network entropy may be estimated as $C \log_L(n)$, where the base of the log is
the path length $L$, and $C$ is the clustering coefficient. Since $n$, $L$ and
$C$ can be calculated for real networks, network entropy for real networks can
be calculated and can reveal aspects of emergence and also of economic,
biological, conceptual and other networks, such as the relationship between
rates of lexical growth and divergence, and the economic benefit of adding
customers to a commercial communications network. \textit{Entropy dating} can
help estimate the age of network processes, such as the growth of hierarchical
society and of language.
