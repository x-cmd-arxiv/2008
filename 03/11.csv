operators of scalar, vector and tensor nature coupled to fermions in the
interpretation of solar neutrinos and KamLAND data. If the unparticle couplings
to the neutrinos are mildly non-universal, such long-range forces will not
factorize out in the neutrino flavour evolution. As a consequence large
deviations from the observed standard matter-induced oscillation pattern for
solar neutrinos would be generated. In this case, severe limits can be set on
the infrared fix point scale, Lambda_u, and the new physics scale, M, as a
function of the ultraviolet (d_UV) and anomalous (d) dimension of the
unparticle operator. For a scalar unparticle, for instance, assuming the
non-universality of the lepton couplings to unparticles to be of the order of a
few per mil we find that, for d_UV=3 and d=1.1, M is constrained to be M >
O(10^9) TeV (M > O(10^10) TeV) if Lambda_u= 1 TeV (10 TeV). For given values of
Lambda_u and d, the corresponding bounds on M for vector [tensor] unparticles
are approximately 100 [3/Sqrt(Lambda_u/TeV)] times those for the scalar case.
Conversely, these results can be translated into severe constraints on
universality violation of the fermion couplings to unparticle operators with
scales which can be accessible at future colliders.

the bosonic string theory, in the background of a generic linear dilaton. We
find a simple exact solution describing a dynamical interpolation between the
perturbative vacuum and the recently discovered nonperturbative tachyon vacuum.
In our solution, the open string tachyon increases exponentially along a null
direction, after which nonlinearities set in and cause the solution to
asymptote to a static state. In particular, the wild oscillations of the open
string fields which plague the time-like rolling tachyon solution are entirely

wires as the range of the interaction potential is changed and their thickness
is varied by performing exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations at various
electronic densities. In the case of unscreened interactions with a long range
1/x tail there is a crossover from a liquid to a quasi Wigner crystal state as
the density decreases. When this interaction is screened, quasi long range
order is prevented from forming, although a significant correlation with 4 k_F
periodicity is still present at low densities. At even lower electron
concentration, exchange is suppressed and the spin-dependent interactions
become negligible, making the electrons behave like spinless fermions. We show
that this behavior is shared by the long range and screened interactions by
studying the spin and charge excitations of the system in both cases. Finally,
we study the effect of electron correlations in the double quantum wire
experiment [Steinberg et al., Phys. Rev. B 77, 113307 (2006)], by introducing
an accurate model for the screening in the experiment and explicitly including
the finite length of the system in our simulations. We find that decreasing the
electron density drives the system from a liquid to a state with quite strong 4
k_F correlations. This crossover takes place around $20 \mu m^{-1}$, the
density where the electron localization occurs in the experiment. The charge
and spin velocities are also in remarkable agreement with the experimental
findings in the proximity of the crossover. We argue that correlation effects
play an important role at the onset of the localization transition.

variety of U(1) gauge factors arising from D-branes in the bulk. In general,
there is no reason why only one of these - the one corresponding to weak
hypercharge - should be massless. Observations require that standard model
particles must be neutral (or have an extremely small charge) under additional
massless U(1)s, i.e. the latter have to belong to a so called hidden sector.
The exchange of heavy messengers, however, can lead to a kinetic mixing between
the hypercharge and the hidden-sector U(1)s, that is testable with near future
experiments. This provides a powerful probe of the hidden sectors and, as a
consequence, of the string theory realisation itself. In the present paper, we
show, using a variety of methods, how the kinetic mixing can be derived from
the underlying type II string compactification, involving supersymmetric and
nonsupersymmetric configurations of D-branes, both in large volumes and in
warped backgrounds with fluxes. We first demonstrate by explicit example that
kinetic mixing occurs in a completely supersymmetric set-up where we can use
conformal field theory techniques. We then develop a supergravity approach
which allows us to examine the phenomenon in more general backgrounds, where we
find that kinetic mixing is natural in the context of flux compactifications.
We discuss the phenomenological consequences for experiments at the low-energy
frontier, searching for signatures of light, sub-electronvolt or even massless
hidden-sector U(1) gauge bosons and minicharged particles.

operator insertion and we study some general properties of the energy
correlation functions for conformal field theories. We argue that the small
angle singularities of energy correlation functions are controlled by the twist
of non-local light-ray operators with a definite spin. We relate the charge two
point function to a particular moment of the parton distribution functions
appearing in deep inelastic scattering. The one point energy correlation
functions are characterized by a few numbers. For ${\cal N}=1$ superconformal
theories the one point function for states created by the R-current or the
stress tensor are determined by the two parameters $a$ and $c$ characterizing
the conformal anomaly. Demanding that the measured energies are positive we get
bounds on $a/c$. We also give a prescription for computing the energy and
charge correlation functions in theories that have a gravity dual. The
prescription amounts to probing the falling string state as it crosses the
$AdS$ horizon with gravitational shock waves. In the leading, two derivative,
gravity approximation the energy is uniformly distributed on the sphere at

protein binding networks. The first type is driven by relatively slow changes
in total concentrations (copy numbers) of interacting proteins. The second
type, to which we refer to as spontaneous, is caused by quickly decaying
thermodynamic deviations away from the equilibrium of the system. As such they
are amenable to methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics used in our study.
We investigate the effects of network connectivity on these fluctuations and
compare them to their upper and lower bounds. The collective effects are shown
to sometimes lead to large power-law distributed amplification of spontaneous
fluctuations as compared to the expectation for isolated dimers. As a
consequence of this, the strength of both types of fluctuations is positively
correlated with the overall network connectivity of proteins forming the
complex. On the other hand, the relative amplitude of fluctuations is
negatively correlated with the abundance of the complex. Our general findings
are illustrated using a real network of protein-protein interactions in baker's
yeast with experimentally determined protein concentrations.

formulated and it is shown that a solution exists provided the medium has small

in a publicly available code called EZ_Ages. The method and error estimation
are described, and the results tested for accuracy and consistency, by
application to integrated spectra of well-known Galactic globular and open
clusters. Ages and abundances from integrated light analysis agree with studies
of resolved stars to within +/-0.1 dex for most clusters, and to within +/-0.2
dex for nearly all cases. The results are robust to the choice of Lick indices
used in the fitting to within +/-0.1 dex, except for a few systematic
deviations which are clearly categorized. The realism of our error estimates is
checked through comparison with detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we
apply EZ_Ages to the sample of galaxies presented in Thomas et al. (2005) and
compare our derived values of age, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] to their analysis. We
find that [alpha/Fe] is very consistent between the two analyses, that ages are
consistent for old (Age > 10 Gyr) populations, but show modest systematic
differences at younger ages, and that [Fe/H] is fairly consistent, with small
systematic differences related to the age systematics. Overall, EZ_Ages
provides accurate estimates of fundamental parameters from medium resolution
spectra of unresolved stellar populations in the old and intermediate-age
regime, for the first time allowing quantitative estimates of the abundances of
C, N, and Ca in these unresolved systems. The EZ_Ages code can be downloaded at

periods for a cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate
a number of relations between rotation period, color and the amplitude of
photometric variability. Stars with M >~ 0.8 Msun show a tight correlation
between period and mass with heavier stars rotating more rapidly. There is a
group of 4 stars with P > 15 days that fall well above this relation, which, if
real, would present a significant challenge to theories of stellar angular
momentum evolution. Below 0.8 Msun the stars continue to follow the period-mass
correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to shorter
periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with observations of
other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower-main sequence stellar
angular momentum evolution. We find that the model reproduces the observations
for solar mass stars, but discrepancies are apparent for stars with 0.6 ~< M ~<
1.0 Msun. We also find that for late-K through early-M dwarf stars in this

than slow rotators in V-I_{C}. This result supports the hypothesis that the
significant discrepancy between the observed and predicted temperatures and
radii of low-mass main sequence stars is due to stellar activity.

derivative of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (MF) to the change of
the MF expected from the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies as a function of
mass and time. We present the SFR in as a function of stellar mass and time
spanning 9<logM<12 and 0<z<5. We show that at z>=3 the average SFR, is a power
law of stellar mass (SFR~M^0.6). The average SFR in the most massive objects at
this redshift is 100-500 Msun/yr. At z~3, the SFR starts to drop at the high
mass end. As z decreases further, the SFR drops at progressively lower masses
(downsizing), dropping most rapidly for high mass (logM>11) galaxies. The mass
at which the SFR starts to deviate from the power-law form (break mass)
progresses smoothly from logM~13 at z~5 to logM~10.9 at z~0.5. The break mass
evolves with redshift as M(z)=2.7x10^10 (1+z)^2.1. We directly observe a
relationship between SFH and mass. More massive galaxies have steeper and
earlier onsets of SF, their SFR peaks earlier and higher, and the following
decay has a shorter e-folding time. The SFR observed in high mass galaxies at
z~4 is sufficient to explain their rapid increase in number density. Within
large uncertainties, at most 0.8 major mergers per Gyr are consistent with the

at later times the change in their numbers turns positive. This shows the

models substantially generalize both the coalescent with ancestral population
size variation and the global-rate speciation-extinction models. We end the
paper with several example applications: first, we show that the evolution of

new approaches towards achieving replica consistency while preserving the

Relationship between the DW velocity and DW structure is obtained from the

motion is clarified. Namely, a field can only drive a domain-wall propagating
along the field direction through the mediation of a damping. Without the
damping, DW cannot propagate along the wire. Contrary to the common wisdom, DW
velocity is, in general, proportional to the energy dissipation rate, and one

substantial lifetime reduction of both beams in collision. This puts a limit on
the maximum storable current and, as a consequence, on the achievable peak and
integrated luminosity. In order to mitigate the problem, numerical and
experimental studies of the parasitic crossings compensation by
current-carrying wires have been done. During the operation for the KLOE
experiment two such wires have been installed at both ends of the interaction
region. They produced a relevant improvement in the lifetime of the weak beam
(positrons) at the maximum current of the strong one (electrons) without
luminosity loss, in agreement with the numerical predictions. The same
compensating mechanism has been adopted during the run for the FINUDA
experiment as well, with less evident benefits than in the previous case. The
interplay between nonlinearities originating from the beam-beam interaction and
the ring lattice has been studied by theoretical simulation and experimental
measurements. Compensation procedures have been set up relying on the
electromagnetic octupoles installed on both rings and used in addition to wire
compensation.
  In this paper the parasitic crossings effects in the DAFNE interaction
regions and their compensation by wires and octupoles are described. A detailed
theoretical analysis of the interplay about different non-linearities is
presented; eventually experimental measurements and observations are discussed.

many-particle system and the analyticity properties of its Boltzmann entropy is
studied. For finite systems, each saddle point is found to cause a
nonanalyticity in the Boltzmann entropy, and the functional form of this
nonanalytic term is derived for the generic case of potentials having the Morse
property. With increasing system size the order of the nonanalytic term grows
unboundedly, leading to an increasing differentiability of the entropy.
Nonetheless, a distribution of an unboundedly growing number of saddle points
may cause a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. Analyzing the
contribution of the saddle points to the density of states in the thermodynamic
limit, conditions on the distribution of saddle points and their curvatures are
derived which are necessary for a phase transition to occur. With these
results, the puzzling absence of topological signatures in the spherical model

new glass phase whose properties interpolate between those of the Bragg and

there is no response in the Bose glass phase (transverse Meissner effect), the

law response in the presence of disorder correlations. We also studied the long

transition between a state where the damage becomes healed (the frozen phase)
and a regime where the damage spreads arriving at a finite (stationary) value
(the damaged phase), when a control parameter is finely tuned. These kinds of
transitions are actually true irreversible phase transitions themselves, and
the issue of their universality class is also discussed.
  Subsequently, the attention is focused on the propagation of damage in
magnetic systems placed in confined geometries, such as the Abraham's Model,
the standard Ising magnet (Glauber dynamics) and the corner geometry. The
influence of interfaces between magnetic domains of different orientation on
the spreading of the perturbation is also discussed, showing that the presence
of interfaces enhances the propagation of the damage. Furthermore, the critical
transition between propagation and nonpropagation of the damage is discussed.
In all cases, the determined critical exponents suggest that the DS transition
does not belong to the universality class of Directed Percolation, unlike many
other systems exhibiting irreversible phase transitions. This result reflects
the dramatic influence of interfaces on the propagation of perturbations in
magnetic systems.

algebra in which the conventional algebraic rules are generalized.

collisions at high energies. We show that it exhibits a characteristic
dependence on nucleus atomic number A and energy/rapidity. We argue that this
dependence offers a unique possibility for determining the low-x structure of
nuclear matter. Applications to RHIC, LHC and EIC experimental programs are
discussed.

discipline in both high energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics. This
field is currently dominated by Imaging Atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) and arrays of these telescopes. Such arrays have achieved the best
angular resolution and energy flux sensitivity in the gamma-ray domain and are
still far from the fundamental limits of the technique. Here I will summarise
some key aspects of this technique and go on to review the current status of
the major instruments and to highlight selected recent results.

principle. For this purpose, we consider a system composed of N peers becoming
active at exponential random times; the system is initiated with only one
server offering the desired file and the other peers after becoming active try
to download it. Once the file has been downloaded by a peer, this one
immediately becomes a server. To investigate the transient behavior of this
file sharing system, we study the instant when the system shifts from a
congested state where all servers available are saturated by incoming demands
to a state where a growing number of servers are idle. In spite of its apparent
simplicity, this queueing model (with a random number of servers) turns out to
be quite difficult to analyze. A formulation in terms of an urn and ball model
is proposed and corresponding scaling results are derived. These asymptotic
results are then compared against simulations.

  We present a solution for 2-generator groups of prime power exponent. Results

is a solvability theorem that applies to a family of groups called GB
(Generalized Burnside) groups that contain infinite as well as finite groups.
The final section discusses the extension to k-generator groups although
details are left for another time.

nebulae (Lya blobs) at z=2.38 and the way they trace large scale structure
(LSS), by exploring their proximity to maximum starbursts through submillimeter
emission. Our most important objectives are to make a census of associated
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), check their properties, and look for a possible
overdensity in the protocluster J2142-4426 at z=2.38.
  We used the newly commissioned Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABoCa) on the
Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope, in its Science Verification
phase, to carry out a deep 10'x10' map at 870 micron, and we performed multiple
checks of the quality of data processing and source extraction.
  Our map, the first published deep image, confirms the capabilities of
APEX/LABoCa as the most efficient current equipment for wide and deep submm
mapping. Twenty-two sources were securely extracted with 870 micron flux
densities in the range 3-21 mJy, rms noise 0.8-2.4 mJy, and far-IR luminosities
probably in the range ~5-20 x 10(12) Lo. Only one of the four 50 kpc-extended
Lya blobs has a secure 870 micron counterpart. The 870 micron source counts in
the whole area are marginally higher than in the SHADES SCUBA survey, with a
possible over-density around this blob. The majority of the 3.6-24 micron SEDs
of the submillimeter sources indicate they are starburst dominated, with
redshifts mostly >2. However, there is evidence of a high-z AGN in ~30% of the
sources.
