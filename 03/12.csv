abundance and the clustering amplitude of dark matter halos. These properties
simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the cluster
observable-mass relation. It was recently discovered that the clustering
amplitude of halos depends not only on the halo mass, but also on various
secondary variables, such as the halo formation time and the concentration;
these dependences are collectively termed assembly bias. Applying modified
Fisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these secondary variables have a
significant impact on the study of dark energy properties using the
self-calibration technique in current (SDSS) and the near future (DES, SPT, and
LSST) cluster surveys. The impact of the secondary dependence is determined by
(1) the scatter in the observable-mass relation and (2) the correlation between
observable and secondary variables. We find that for optical surveys, the
secondary dependence does not significantly influence an SDSS-like survey;
however, it may affect a DES-like survey (given the high scatter currently
expected from optical clusters) and an LSST-like survey (even for low scatter
values and low correlations). For an SZ survey such as SPT, the impact of
secondary dependence is insignificant if the scatter is 20% or lower but can be
enhanced by the potential high scatter values introduced by a highly correlated
background. Accurate modeling of the assembly bias is necessary for cluster
self-calibration in the era of precision cosmology.

equivalence between double loop and area integrals a la arXiv: 0708.1625, then
this pure geometric relation can be tested for various choices of n-side
polygons. The simplest possibility arises at n=infinity, with polygon
substituted by an arbitrary continuous curve. If the curve is a circle, the
minimal surface problem is exactly solvable. If it infinitesimally deviates
from a circle, then the duality relation can be studied by expanding in powers
of a small parameter. In the first approximation the Nambu-Goto (NG) equations
can be linearized, and the peculiar NG Laplacian plays the central role. Making
use of explicit zero-modes of this operator (NG-harmonic functions), we
investigate the geometric duality in the lowest orders for small deformations
of arbitrary shape lying in the plane of the original circle. We find a
surprisingly strong dependence of the minimal area on regularization procedure
affecting ""the boundary terms"" in minimal area. If these terms are totally
omitted, the remaining piece is regularization independent, but still differs
by simple numerical factors like 4 from the double-loop integral which
represents the BDS formula so that we stop short from the first non-trivial
confirmation of the Alday-Maldacena duality. This confirms the earlier-found
discrepancy for two parallel lines at n=infinity, but demonstrates that it
actually affects only a finite number (out of infinitely many) of parameters in
the functional dependence on the shape of the boundary, and the duality is only
slightly violated, which allows one to call this violation an anomaly.

finite-gap solution to the equations of a string moving on R x S^3. The
derivation is only formal as we do not regularise divergent sums over stability
angles. Moreover, with regards to the AdS/CFT correspondence the result is
incomplete as the fluctuations orthogonal to this subspace in AdS_5 x S^5 are
not taken into account. Nevertheless, the calculation serves the purpose of
understanding how the moduli of the algebraic curve gets quantised
semiclassically, purely from the point of view of finite-gap integration and
with no input from the gauge theory side. Our result is expressed in a very
compact and simple formula which encodes the infinite sum over stability angles
in a succinct way and reproduces exactly what one expects from knowledge of the
dual gauge theory. Namely, at tree level the filling fractions of the algebraic
curve get quantised in large integer multiples of hbar = 1/lambda^{1/2}. At
1-loop order the filling fractions receive Maslov index corrections of hbar/2
and all the singular points of the spectral curve become filled with small
half-integer multiples of hbar. For the subsector in question this is in
agreement with the previously obtained results for the semiclassical energy
spectrum of the string using the method proposed in hep-th/0703191.
  Along the way we derive the complete hierarchy of commuting flows for the
string in the R x S^3 subsector. Moreover, we also derive a very general and
simple formula for the stability angles around a generic finite-gap solution.
We also stress the issue of quantum operator orderings since this problem
already crops up at 1-loop in the form of the subprincipal symbol.

constrain simultaneously the spatial curvature and the equation of state of

results. However computing a full CMB power spectrum with a Boltzmann code is
quite slow; for instance if we want to work with many dark energy and/or
modified gravity models, or would like to optimize experiments where many
different configurations need to be tested, it is possible to adopt a quicker
and more efficient approach.
  In this paper we consider the compression of the projected Planck CMB data
into four parameters, R (scaled distance to last scattering surface), l_a
(angular scale of sound horizon at last scattering), Omega_b h^2 (baryon
density fraction) and n_s (powerlaw index of primordial matter power spectrum),
all of which can be computed quickly. We show that, although this compression
loses information compared to the full likelihood, such information loss
becomes negligible when more data is added. We also demonstrate that the method
can be used for scalar field dark energy independently of the parametrisation
of the equation of state, and discuss how this method should be used for other
kinds of dark energy models.

Certain of these properties contradict the character of the physical in quantum

exploiting the recent evidence connecting our conscious experiences to

resulting colour-magnitude diagram shows that early-type FS90 galaxies that are
spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members or that were considered as definite
members by FS90, follow a well defined CMR (sigma_(C -T1) ~ 0.07 mag) that
spans 9 magnitudes in brightness with no apparent change of slope. This
relation is very tight for the whole magnitude range but S0 galaxies show a
larger dispersion, apparently due to a separation of ellipticals and S0s.
Antlia displays a slope of -13.6 in a T1 vs. (C -T1) diagram, in agreement with
results for clusters like Fornax, Virgo, Perseus and Coma, which are
dynamically different to Antlia. This fact might indicate that the build up of
the CMR in cluster of galaxies is more related to galaxies internal processes
than to the influence of the environment. Interpreting the CMR as a
luminosity-metallicity relation of old stellar systems, the metallicities of
the Antlia galaxies define a global relation down to Mv ~ -13. We also find,
for early-type dwarfs, no clear relation between luminosity and effective
radius, indicating a nearly constant mean effective radius of ~ 1 kpc. This
value is also found in several samples of dwarf galaxies in Virgo and Coma.

growth of lateral pair distances agrees with the Richardson law, but yields a
smaller Richardson constant due to correlated pair motion in plumes. Our
results thus imply that Richardson dispersion is also found in anisotropic
turbulence. We find that extremely large vertical accelerations appear less
frequently than lateral ones and are not connected with rising or falling

20058-5234. The bulk of the observations (135h) were obtained during a WET
campaign (XCOV15) in July 1997 that featured coordinated observing from 4
southern observatory sites over an 8-day period. The remaining data (42h) were
obtained in June 2004 at Mt John Observatory in NZ over a one-week observing
period. This work significantly extends the discovery observations of this
low-amplitude (few percent) pulsator by increasing the number of detected
frequencies from 8 to 18, and employs a simulation procedure to confirm the
reality of these frequencies to a high level of significance (1 in 1000). The
nature of the observed pulsation spectrum precludes identification of unique
pulsation mode properties using any clearly discernable trends. However, we
have used a global modelling procedure employing genetic algorithm techniques
to identify the n, l values of 8 pulsation modes, and thereby obtain
asteroseismic measurements of several model parameters, including the stellar
mass (0.55 M_sun) and T_eff (~28200 K). These values are consistent with those
derived from published spectral fitting: T_eff ~ 28400 K and log g ~ 7.86. We
also present persuasive evidence from apparent rotational mode splitting for
two of the modes that indicates this compact object is a relatively rapid
rotator with a period of 2h. In direct analogy with the corresponding
properties of the hydrogen (DAV) atmosphere pulsators, the stable low-amplitude
pulsation behaviour of EC 20058 is entirely consistent with its inferred
effective temperature, which indicates it is close to the blue edge of the DBV
instability strip. (abridged)

formation of a highly entangled state where short-distance antiferromagnetic

all three sources, while OH maser emission is detected in IRAS 17443-2949 and
IRAS 17580-3111 as well as in other two objects within the observed fields:
IRAS 17442-2942 (unknown nature) and IRAS 17579-3121 (also cataloged as a

associated with H2O maser emission. The three known water-maser-emitting PNe
have clear bipolar morphologies, which suggests that water maser emission in
these objects is related to non-spherical mass-loss episodes. We speculate that
these bipolar PNe would have ``water-fountain'' Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)

objects that have been classified as OHPNe (objects with both OH maser and
radio continuum emission, that could be extremely young PNe) based on
single-dish observations, since interferometric data of both OH masers and
continuum are necessary for a proper identification as members of this class.

substructural logic usually associated with K is an algebraizable logic that
has K as its equivalent algebraic semantics, and is a logic that preserves
truth, i.e., 1 is the only truth value preserved by the inferences of the
logic. In this paper we introduce another logic associated with K, namely the
logic that preserves degrees of truth, in the sense that it preserves lower
bounds of truth values in inferences. We study this second logic mainly from
the point of view of abstract algebraic logic. We determine its algebraic
models and we classify it in the Leibniz and the Frege hierarchies: we show
that it is always fully selfextensional, that for most varieties K it is
non-protoalgebraic, and that it is algebraizable if and only K is a variety of
generalized Heyting algebras, in which case it coincides with the logic that
preserves truth. We also characterize the new logic in three ways: by a Hilbert
style axiomatic system, by a Gentzen style sequent calculus, and by a set of
conditions on its closure operator. Concerning the relation between the two
logics, we prove that the truth preserving logic is the purely inferential
extension of the one that preserves degrees of truth with either the rule of

The models assume homogeneous, isotropic, closed spacetime geometries, a single
scalar field moving in a quadratic potential, and a fundamental cosmological
constant. The allowed classical histories and their probabilities are
calculated to leading semiclassical order. We find that for the most realistic
range of parameters analyzed a minimum amount of scalar field is required, if
there is any at all, in order for the universe to behave classically at late
times. If the classical late time histories are extended back, they may be
singular or bounce at a finite radius. The ensemble of classical histories is
time symmetric although individual histories are generally not. The no-boundary
proposal selects inflationary histories, but the measure on the classical
solutions it provides is heavily biased towards small amounts of inflation.
However, the probability for a large number of efoldings is enhanced by the
volume factor needed to obtain the probability for what we observe in our past
light cone, given our present age. Our results emphasize that it is the quantum
state of the universe that determines whether or not it exhibits a
quasiclassical realm and what histories are possible or probable within that

spectra peak at 1-3 keV, as in other Seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with either
a constant contribution from a soft excess component below 1 keV and Compton
reflection component above 2 keV, or variable warm absorption enhancing the
variability in the 1-3 keV range. The rms spectra, which shows the shape of the
variable components only, is well described by a single power law with an
absorption feature around 0.7 keV, which gives it an apparent soft excess. This
spectral shape can be produced by a power law varying in normalisation,
affected by an approximately constant (within each orbit) warm absorber, with
parameters similar to those found by Turner et al. for the warm-absorber layer
covering all spectral components in their scattering scenario. The total soft
excess in the average spectrum can therefore be produced by a combination of
constant warm absorption on the power law plus an additional less variable
component. On shorter time-scales, the rms spectrum hardens and this evolution
is well described by a change in power law slope, while the absorption
parameters remain the same. The frequency dependence of the rms spectra can be
interpreted as variability arising from propagating fluctuations through an
extended emitting region, whose emitted spectrum is a power law that hardens
towards the centre. This scenario reduces the short time-scale variability of
lower energy bands making the variable spectrum harder on shorter time-scales
and at the same time explains the hard lags found in these data by Markowitz et
al.

Kato, in which a global warping or eccentricity of the disc has a fundamental
role. These large-scale deformations combine with trapped modes to generate
`intermediate' waves of negative energy that are damped as they approach either
their corotation resonance or the inner edge of the disc, resulting in
amplification of the trapped waves. We determine the growth rates of the
inertial modes, as well as their dependence on the spin of the black hole and

Optical spectroscopy of this cluster gives a dynamical mass in good agreement
with the other independent mass estimates. The three components of the
RCS2319+00 supercluster are separated from their nearest neighbor by a mere <3
Mpc in the plane of the sky and likely <10 Mpc along the line-of-sight, and we
interpret this structure as the high-redshift antecedent of massive (~10^15
Msun) z~0.5 clusters such as MS0451.5-0305.

soft X-ray (0.3--2 keV) peaks with the two central cD nuclei; one of them has
an associated hard X-ray (2--10 keV) point source. We suggest that the two

temperature [K. Xu, H. Liu and J. Jiang, Phys. Fluids {\bf 19}, 016101 (2007)],
to simulate non-equilibrium flows. In this paper, instead of using three
temperatures in $x-$, $y-$, and $z$-directions, we are going to further define
the translational temperature as a second-order symmetric tensor. Based on a
multiple stage BGK-type collision model and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, the
corresponding macroscopic gas dynamics equations in three-dimensional space
will be derived. The zeroth-order expansion gives the 10 moment closure
equations of Levermore [C.D. Levermore, J. Stat. Phys {\bf 83}, pp.1021
(1996)]. To the 1st-order expansion, the derived gas dynamic equations can be
considered as a regularization of Levermore's 10 moments equations. The new gas
dynamic equations have the same structure as the Navier-Stokes equations, but
the stress strain relationship in the Navier-Stokes equations is replaced by an
algebraic equation with temperature differences. At the same time, the heat
flux, which is absent in Levermore's 10 moment closure, is recovered. As a
result, both the viscous and the heat conduction terms are unified under a
single anisotropic temperature concept. In the continuum flow regime, the new
gas dynamic equations automatically recover the standard Navier-Stokes
equations. The current gas dynamic equations are natural extension of the
Navier-Stokes equations to the near continuum flow regime and can be used for
microflow computations. Two examples, the force-driven Poiseuille flow and the
Couette flow in the transition flow regime, are used to validate the model.
Both analytical and numerical results are encouraging.

detonation transition (DDT) in Type Ia supernovae. The Zel'dovich mechanism for
DDT requires the formation of a nearly isothermal region of mixed ash and fuel
that is larger than a critical size. We primarily consider the hypothesis by
Khokhlov et al. and Niemeyer and Woosley that the nearly isothermal, mixed
region is produced when the flame makes the transition to the distributed
regime. We use two models for the distribution of the turbulent velocity
fluctuations to estimate the probability as a function of the density in the
exploding white dwarf that a given region of critical size is in the
distributed regime due to strong local turbulent stretching of the flame
structure. We also estimate lower limits on the number of such regions as a
function of density. We find that the distributed regime, and hence perhaps
DDT, occurs in a local region of critical size at a density at least a factor
of 2-3 larger than predicted for mean conditions that neglect intermittency.
This factor brings the transition density to be much larger than the empirical
value from observations in most situations. We also consider the intermittency
effect on the more stringent conditions for DDT by Lisewski et al. and Woosley.
We find that a turbulent velocity of $10^8$ cm/s in a region of size $10^6$ cm,
required by Lisewski et al., is rare. We expect that intermittency gives a
weaker effect on the Woosley model with stronger criterion. The predicted
transition density from this criterion remains below $10^7$ g/cm$^3$ after
accounting for intermittency using our intermittency models.

These high-resolution VLBA images reveal that the distribution of SiO masers is
roughly on a persistent elliptical ring with the lengths of the major and minor
axes of about 18.5 and 15.8 mas, respectively, along a position angle of
150^{\circ}. And the red-shifted masers are found to be slightly closer to the
central star than the blue-shifted masers. The line-of-sight velocity structure
of the SiO masers shows that with respect to the systemic velocity of -6.8 km/s
the higher velocity features are closer to the star, which can be well
explained by the simple outflow or infall without rotation kinematics of SiO
masers around AH Sco. Study of proper motions of 59 matched features between
two epochs clearly indicates that the SiO maser shell around AH Sco was
undergoing an overall contraction to the star at a velocity of ~13 km/s at a
distance of 2.26 kpc to AH Sco. Our 3-dimensional maser kinematics model
further suggests that such an inward motion is very likely due to the
gravitation of the central star. The distance to AH Sco of 2.26$\pm$0.19 kpc
obtained from the 3-dimensional kinematics model fitting is consistent with its
kinematic distance of 2.0 kpc.

scientific and applied interest. It has two surface state bands (1)
anti-bonding pi* band, which has acceptor states and (2) bonding pi band, which
has donor states. Due to its asymmetric dimer reconstruction, transport through
this surface can be considered in two distinct directions, i.e. along and
perpendicular to the paired dimer rows. We calculate the zero bias conductance
of these surface states under flat-band condition and find that conduction
along the dimer row direction is significant due to strong orbital
hybridization. We also find that the surface conductance is orders of magnitude
higher than the bulk conductance close to the band edges for the unpassivated
surface at room temperature. Therefore, we propose that the transport through
these surface states may be the dominant conduction mechanisms in the recently
reported scanning tunneling microscopy of silicon nanomembranes. We also
calculate the zero bias conductance under flat-band condition for the weakly
interacting dangling bond wires along and perpendicular to the dimer row
direction and find similar trends. Extended Huckel theory is used for the
electronic structure calculations, which is benchmarked with the GW
approximation for Si and has been successfully applied to Si systems in past.

least $C^{2}$ and the $(n-2)$-dimensional maximally symmetric subspace is

limit $\alpha \to 0$, solutions are classified into general relativistic (GR)
and non-GR branches, respectively, where $\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
constant. We show that a wormhole throat respecting the dominant energy
condition coincides with a branch surface in the GR branch, otherwise the null
energy condition is violated there. In the non-GR branch, it is shown that
there is no wormhole solution for $k\alpha \ge 0$. For the matter field with
zero tangential pressure, it is also shown in the non-GR branch with
$k\alpha<0$ and $\Lambda \le 0$ that the dominant energy condition holds at the
wormhole throat if the radius of the throat satisfies some inequality. In the
vacuum case, a fine-tuning of the coupling constants is shown to be necessary
and the radius of a wormhole throat is fixed. Explicit wormhole solutions

processes in nature and society display long range correlations. Hence, in the
last few years, considerable research effort has been directed towards studying
the distribution of return intervals for long range correlated time series.
Based on numerical simulations, it was shown that the return interval
distributions are of stretched exponential type. In this paper, we obtain an
analytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long range
correlated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are
large. We show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a
stretched exponential form. We also discuss the regimes of validity and perform
detailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the

asymmetric nuclear matter taken in the Hartree-Fock scheme. The nuclear binding
is insured by a background chiral invariant scalar field associated with the
radial fluctuations of the chiral quark condensate. Nuclear matter saturation
is obtained once the scalar response of the nucleon generating three-body
repulsive forces is incorporated. For these parameters related to the scalar
sector and quark confinement mechanism inside the nucleon we make use of an
analysis of lattice results on the nucleon mass evolution with the quark mass.
The other parameters are constrained as most as possible by standard hadron and
nuclear phenomenology. Special attention is paid to the treatment of the
propagation of the scalar fluctuations. The rearrangement terms associated with
in-medium modified mass and coupling constants are explicitly included to
satisfy the Hugenholtz -Van Hove theorem. We point out the important role of
the tensor piece of the rho exchange Fock term to reproduce the asymmetry
energy of nuclear matter. We also discuss the isospin dependence of the Landau
nucleon effective mass.

roAp star 10Aql. Aims:The goal was to provide an unambiguous frequency
identification for this little studied star, as well as to discuss the detected
frequencies in the context of magnetic models and analyze the influence of the
magnetic field on the pulsation. Methods: Using traditional Fourier analysis
techniques on three independent data reductions, intrinsic frequencies for the
star are identified. Theoretical non-adiabatic axisymmetric modes influenced by
a magnetic field having polar field strengths Bp = 0-5kG were computed to
compare the observations to theory. Results: The high-precision data allow us
to identify three definite intrinsic pulsation frequencies and two other
candidate frequencies with low S/N. Considering the observed spacings, only one
(50.95microHz) is consistent with the main sequence nature of roAp stars. The
comparison with theoretical models yields a best fit for a 1.95Msun model
having solar metallicity, suppressed envelope convection, and homogenous helium
abundance. Furthermore, our analysis confirms the suspected slow rotation of
the star and sets new lower limits to the rotation period (Prot>1 month) and
inclination (i>30\pm10deg.). Conclusions:The observed frequency spectrum is not
rich enough to unambiguously identify a model. On the other hand, the models
hardly represent roAp stars in detail due to the approximations needed to
describe the interactions of the magnetic field with stellar structure and
pulsation. Consequently, errors in the model frequencies needed for the fitting
procedure can only be estimated. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that models
which suppress convection and include solar metallicity, in agreement with
current concepts of roAp stars, fit the observations best.

Fe5Si3 and Ni2Si up to 75 GPa. Both materials were synthesized in bulk
quantities via a solid-state reaction. In the pressure range covered by the
experiments, no evidence of the occurrence of phase transitions was observed.
On top of that, Fe5Si3 was found to compress isotropically, whereas an
anisotropic compression was observed in Ni2Si. The linear incompressibility of
Ni2Si along the c-axis is similar in magnitude to the linear incompressibility
of diamond. This fact is related to the higher valence-electron charge density
of Ni2Si along the c-axis. The observed anisotropic compression of Ni2Si is
also related to the layered structure of Ni2Si where hexagonal layers of Ni2+
cations alternate with graphite-like layers formed by (NiSi)2- entities. The
experimental results are supported by ab initio total-energy calculations
carried out using density functional theory and the pseudopotential method. For
Fe5Si3, the calculations also predicted a phase transition at 283 GPa from the
hexagonal P63/mcm phase to the cubic structure adopted by Fe and Si in the
garnet Fe5Si3O12. The room-temperature equations of state for Fe5Si3 and Ni2Si
are also reported and a possible correlation between the bulk modulus of iron
silicides and the coordination number of their minority element is discussed.
Finally, we report novel descriptions of these structures, in particular of the
predicted high-pressure phase of Fe5Si3 (the cation subarray in the garnet
Fe5Si3O12), which can be derived from spinel Fe2SiO4 (Fe6Si3O12).

theory in terms of the Coulomb interaction $U$, for the two-dimensional Hubbard
model on the square lattice. The phase diagram is investigated in detail. The
Hubbard model for small $U$ is mapped onto an effective Hamiltonian with the
attractive interaction using the canonical transformation: $H_{eff}=e^S
He^{-S}$. The gap equation of the weak coupling formulation is solved without
numerical ambiguity to determine the symmetry of Cooper pairs. The
superconducting gap crucially depends on the position of the van Hove
singularity. We show the phase diagram in the plane of the electron filling
$n_e$ and the next nearest-neighbor transfer $t'$. The d-wave pairing is
dominant for the square lattice in a wide range of $n_e$ and $t'$. The d-wave
pairing is also stable for the square lattice with anisotropic $t'$. The
three-band $d$-$p$ model is also investigated, for which the d-wave pairing is
stable in a wide range of $n_e$ and $t_{pp}$ (the transfer between neighboring
oxygen atoms). In the weak coupling analysis, the second-neighbor transfer
parameter $-t'$ could not be so large so that the optimum doping rate is in the
range of $0.8 <n_e <0.9$.

necessary to avoid an initial singularity. In the model considered the universe
starts its evolution in the vacuum phase at time $t\to - \infty$. In this phase
the scale factor $a\to 0$, energy density $\rho \to 0$ and coupling of the
interactions $g^2_s \to 0$. After this stage the universe evolves to the
non-singular hot Big Bang phase $\rho \to \rho_{\text{max}} < \infty$. Then the
standard classical universe emerges. During the whole evolution the scale
factor increases monotonically. We solve this model analytically. We also
propose and solve numerically the model with an additional dilaton potential in
which the universe starts the evolution from the asymptotically free vacuum
phase $g^2_s \to 0$ and then evolves non-singularly to the emerging dark energy
dominated phase with the saturated coupling constant $g^2_s \to \text{const}$.

densities, lower ellipticities and halo-like structures. At fixed luminosity,
the large-scale overdensity depends strongly on parameters related to the
recent star formation history, that is colour and D(4000), but is almost
independent of the structural parameters $R_{90}/R_{50}$ and $\mu_\ast$. All
the physical properties are statistically linked to the shear of the
large-scale environment even when the large-scale density is constrained to a
narrow range. This statistical link has been found to be most significant in
the quasi-linear regions where the large-scale density approximates to an order
of unity, but no longer significant in highly nonlinear regimes with
$\delta_{\rm LS}\gg 1$.

terms, the partition function of such a model does not depend on all the
details of the Markov chain that models the polymer, but only on the time
elapsed between successive returns to zero and on whether the walk is in the
upper or lower half plane between such returns. This observation leads to a
natural generalization of the model, in terms of arbitrary laws of return
times: the most interesting case being the one of return times with power law
tails (with exponent 1+alpha, alpha=1/2 in the case of the symmetric random
walk). The main results we present here are:
  1. The improvement of the known result 1/(1+alpha) smaller or equal to m_c
smaller or equal to 1, as soon as alpha >1 for what concerns the upper bound,
and down to alpha = 0.65 for the lower bound.
  2. A proof of the fact that the critical curve lies strictly below the
critical curve of the annealed model for every non-zero value of the coupling
parameter.

the phase diagram on the details of the return probability (and not only on the

strategy, while upper bounds are based on estimates of non-integer moments of

hydrogen, H2. Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing
gravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen
deuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the
cosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic
mass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the
characteristic masses of population III stars. Motivated by the importance of
the atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several
chemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the
sensitivity of the low temperature H2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H2 to
para-H2, the uncertainty in the low temperature cooling rate of H2 excited by
collisions with H, the effects of cooling from H2 excited by collisions with H+
and e-, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions
responsible for determining the H2 fraction in the gas.
  We show that the most important of the neglected processes is the excitation
of H2 by collisions with protons and electrons. This cools the gas more rapidly
at early times, and so it forms less H2 and HD at late times. This fact, as
well as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly
affects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to
clear differences in future detailed 3D studies of first structure formation.
Finally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle
sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1
ratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by
a more detailed treatment. (abridged)

precise resolution of the artificially introduced E1 resonance. Comparing with
the results of a conventional calculation with explicit neutron-proton
continuum wave functions it is shown that the LIT approach leads to an
excellent reproduction of the cross section in the resonance region and of
further finer cross section details at higher energies. To this end, however,

between form and function and its role during network formation remains largely
unexplored. While recent studies introduce dynamics by considering rewiring
processes of a pre-existent network, we study network growth and formation by
proposing an evolutionary preferential attachment model, its main feature being
that the capacity of a node to attract new links depends on a dynamical
variable governed in turn by the node interactions. As a specific example, we
focus on the problem of the emergence of cooperation by analyzing the formation
of a social network with interactions given by the Prisoner's Dilemma. The
resulting networks show many features of real systems, such as scale-free
degree distributions, cooperative behavior and hierarchical clustering.
Interestingly, results such as the cooperators being located mostly on nodes of
intermediate degree are very different from the observations of cooperative
behavior on static networks. The evolutionary preferential attachment mechanism
points to an evolutionary origin of scale-free networks and may help understand
similar feedback problems in the dynamics of complex networks by appropriately
choosing the game describing the interaction of nodes.

condensate with repulsive atom-atom interactions in a disordered potential. We
focus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over
the kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and
for small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the
disorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression
of the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic
potential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both
the momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the
disorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from
the fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections
from large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the
condensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario
for which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single
modulations of the disordered potential play central roles. For weak disorder,
the suppression of the expansion signals the onset of Anderson localization,
which is due to multiple scattering from the modulations of the disordered
potential. We compute analytically the localized density profile of the
condensate and show that the localization crucially depends on the correlation
function of the disorder. In particular, for speckle potentials the long-range
correlations induce an effective mobility edge in 1D finite systems. Numerical
calculations performed in the mean-field approximation support our analysis for
both strong and weak disorder.

disk along parameterized trajectories. We find that at least a weak r-process

conditions required for this production of r-process nuclei stem directly from
the interactions of the neutrinos emitted by the disk with the free neutrons
and protons in the outflow.

and acoustic wave energy in complex built-up structures. The technique
interpolates between standard Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and full ray
tracing containing both these methods as limiting case. By writing the flow of
ray trajectories in terms of linear phase space operators, it is suggested here
to reformulate ray-tracing algorithms in terms of boundary operators containing
only short ray segments. SEA can now be identified as a low resolution ray
tracing algorithm and typical SEA assumptions can be quantified in terms of the
properties of the ray dynamics. The new technique presented here enhances the
range of applicability of standard SEA considerably by systematically
incorporating dynamical correlations wherever necessary. Some of the
inefficiencies inherent in typical ray tracing methods can be avoided using
only a limited amount of the geometrical ray information. The new dynamical
theory - Dynamical Energy Analysis (DEA) - thus provides a universal approach
towards determining wave energy distributions in complex structures.

exciton-based quantum computation with self-assembled quantum dots. We
demonstrate that optical coherence of a confined exciton qubit exposed to
phonon-induced dephasing can be substantially enhanced through the application
of a simple periodic sequence of control pulses. The shape of the quantum dot
has a significant effect on the dephasing properties. Remarkably, we find that
quantum dots with parameters optimized for implementing quantum computation are
among the most susceptible to dephasing, yet periodic decoupling is most
efficient for exactly that type of dot. We also show that the presence of an
electric field, which is a necessary ingredient for many exciton-based quantum
computing schemes, may further increase the control efficiency. Our results
suggest that dynamical decoupling may be a method of choice for robust storage
of exciton qubits during idle stages of quantum algorithms.

of the hottest clusters known. The X-ray emitting plasma exhibits
bow-shock-like temperature and density jumps. The segregation of this plasma
from the peaks of the mass distribution determined by gravitational lensing has
been interpreted as a direct proof of collisionless dark matter. If the high
shock speed inferred from the shock jump conditions equals the relative speed
of the merging CDM halos, however, this merger is predicted to be such a rare
event in a LCDM universe that observing it presents a possible conflict with
the LCDM model.
  We examined this question using high resolution, 2D simulations of gas
dynamics in cluster collisions to analyze the relative motion of the clusters,
the bow shock, and the contact discontinuity, and relate these to the X-ray
data for the bullet cluster. We find that the velocity of the fluid shock need
not equal the relative velocity of the CDM components. An illustrative
simulation finds that the present relative velocity of the CDM halos is 16%
lower than that of the shock. While this conclusion is sensitive to the
detailed initial mass and gas density profiles of the colliding clusters, such
a decrease of the inferred halo relative velocity would significantly increase
the likelihood of finding 1E 0657-56 in a LCDM universe.
