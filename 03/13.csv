Besides the usual 1/r term, the main effects of the new spin-two field are a
shift of the total mass of the body and the presence of a new power-like term,
with sizes determined by the mass and the shape (the radius) of the source.
These modifications, being source dependent, give rise to a dynamical violation

the IR emission and its implications for cool core clusters. The strength of
the mid-IR excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the optical
emission lines. Excluding the four systems dominated by an AGN, the excess
mid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likely
related to star formation. The mass of molecular gas (estimated from CO
observations) is correlated with the IR luminosity as found for normal star
forming galaxies. The gas depletion time scale is about 1 Gyr. The physical
extent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emission
line nebulae. This supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs in
molecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence that
the emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. We find
a correlation between mass deposition rates (${\dot M}_X$) estimated from the
X-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infrared
luminosity. The star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass deposition
rates suggesting that the re-heating of the ICM is generally very effective in
reducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating it
completely.

protostar with regions that possess a slightly elevated temperature of ~30 K.
The molecules detected by Sakai et al. are typically associated only with dark
molecular clouds, and not with the more evolved hot corino phase. In order to
determine if L1527 is chemically distinct from a dark cloud, we compute models
including various degrees of heating. The results indicate that the composition
of L1527 is somewhat more likely to be due to ``Warm Carbon Chain Chemistry''

signature of a previously uncharacterized early phase of low mass star
formation, which can be characterized as a ``lukewarm'' corino. We also include
predictions for other molecular species that might be observed toward candidate
lukewarm corino sources. Although our calculations show that unsaturated
hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynes can be produced in the gas phase as the grains
warm up to 30 K, they also show that such species do not disappear rapidly from

the exchange of information in a network. Large-scale quantum communication (of
the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond
this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission
channel. Quantum communication eventually fails when the probability of a dark
count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a
photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, D\""{u}r, Cirac
and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining
entanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable
distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated,
the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to
the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement
swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ
quantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ
with atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled
with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by
performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they
have passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement
is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic
excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and
establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with
stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as
quantum messengers.

particular, for the sequence with good foldability properties, the mechanically
induced structural transitions can be related to thermodynamical aspects of
folding. Moreover, for the same sequence the knowledge of the landscape profile
allows for a good estimation of the life times of the native configuration for
temperatures ranging from the folding to the collapse temperature. For the
random sequence, mechanical and thermal unfolding appear to follow different
paths along the landscape.

investigated to verify their classification and to improve their distance

stars based on their large proper motions and relatively faint magnitudes.
Better photometric and/or spectroscopic distances were required for selecting
stars which are worth the effort of trigonometric parallax measurements.
  Low-resolution spectra were obtained with NASPEC at the Tautenburg 2m
telescope and with CAFOS at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope. The spectral types
of M-type stars were determined by direct comparison of the target's spectra
with those of comparison stars of known spectral types observed with the same
instrument. The classification of earlier types was done based on comparison
with published spectral libraries. The majority were classified as M dwarfs
including 11 stars within 25 pc. The fainter component of LDS 1365, previously
thought to form a nearby common proper motion pair, is according to our results
an unrelated high-velocity background star. For several other nearby common
proper motion pairs our distance estimates of the fainter components are in
good agreement with Hipparcos distances of the brighter components. (abridged)

correctly identified optimal combinations of four drugs with only one third of
the tests performed in a fully factorial search. In experiments identifying
combinations of three doses of up to six drugs for selective killing of human
cancer cells, search algorithms resulted in a highly significant enrichment of
selective combinations compared with random searches. In simulations using a
network model of cell death, we found that the search algorithms identified the
optimal combinations of 6-9 interventions in 80-90% of tests, compared with
15-30% for an equivalent random search. These findings suggest that modified

discovery of novel therapeutic drug combinations. This report also helps to
frame a biomedical problem that will benefit from an interdisciplinary effort

systems, when the tidal torque on a Kerr black hole due to quadrupole-monopole

equations with this term reveals the existence of a conserved quantity at 2PN
order when averaging over orbital motion. This quantity allows one to solve the
(orbit-averaged) precession equations exactly in the case of equal masses and
arbitrary spins, neglecting radiation reaction. For unequal masses, an exact
solution does not exist in closed form, but we are still able to derive
accurate approximate analytic solutions. We also show how to incorporate
radiation reaction effects into our analytic solutions adiabatically, and
compare the results to solutions obtained numerically. For various
configurations of the binary, the relative difference in the accumulated
orbital phase computed using our analytic solutions versus a full numerical
solution vary from about 0.3% to 1.8% over the 80 - 140 orbital cycles
accumulated while sweeping over the orbital frequency range 20 - 300 Hz. This
typically corresponds to a discrepancy of order 5-6 radians. While this may not
be accurate enough for implementation in LIGO template banks, we still believe
that our new solutions are potentially quite useful for comparing numerical
relativity simulations of spinning binary black hole systems with
post-Newtonian theory. They can also be used to gain more understanding of
precession effects, with potential application to the gravitational recoil
problem, and to provide semi-analytical templates for spinning, precessing
binaries.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) up to July 2007. We present the spectral, spatial, and
temporal properties of the bursts in the INTEGRAL GRB catalogue using data from
the imager, IBIS, and spectrometer, SPI. Spectral properties of the GRBs are
determined using power-law, Band model and quasithermal model fits to the
prompt emission. Spectral lags, i.e. the time delay in the arrival of
low-energy gamma-rays with respect to high-energy gamma-rays, are measured for
31 of the GRBs. The photon index distribution of power-law fits to the prompt
emission spectra is consistent with that obtained by Swift. The peak flux
distribution shows that INTEGRAL detects proportionally more weak GRBs than
Swift because of its higher sensitivity in a smaller field of view. The all-sky
rate of GRBs above ~0.15 ph cm^-2 s^-1 is ~1400 yr^-1 in the fully coded field
of view of IBIS. Two groups are identified in the spectral lag distribution,
one with short lags <0.75 s (between 25-50 keV and 50-300 keV) and one with
long lags >0.75 s. Most of the long-lag GRBs are inferred to have low redshifts
because of their long spectral lags, their tendency to have low peak energies
and their faint optical and X-ray afterglows. They are mainly observed in the
direction of the supergalactic plane with a quadrupole moment of
Q=-0.225+/-0.090 and hence reflect the local large-scale structure of the
Universe. The rate of long-lag GRBs with inferred low luminosity is ~25% of
Type Ib/c supernovae. Some of these bursts could be produced by the collapse of
a massive star without a supernova or by a different progenitor, such as the
merger of two white dwarfs or a white dwarf with a neutron star or black hole,
possibly in the cluster environment without a host galaxy.

strongly coupled to the electronic states at the Fermi level and generate

The high resolution (R>=14,000) observations allow the most accurate radial
velocity and acceleration measurements of the stars in the central parsec of
the Galaxy. Detected stars can be divided into three groups based on the CO
absorption band heads at ~2.2935 microns and the He I lines at ~2.0581 microns
and ~2.112, 2.113 microns: cool, narrow-line hot and broad-line hot. The radial
velocities of the cool, late-type stars have approximately a symmetrical
distribution with its center at ~-7.8(+/-10.3) km/s and a standard deviation
~113.7(+/-10.3) km/s. Although our statistics are dominated by the brightest
stars, we estimate a central black hole mass of 3.9(+/-1.1) million solar
masses, consistent with current estimates from complete orbits of individual
stars. Our surface density profile and the velocity dispersion of the late type
stars support the existence of a low density region at the Galactic center
suggested by earlier observations. Many hot, early-type stars show radial
velocity changes higher than maximum values allowed by pure circular orbital
motions around a central massive object, suggesting that the motions of these
stars greatly deviate from circular orbital motions around the Galactic center.
The correlation between the radial velocities of the early type He I stars and
their declination offsets from Sagittarius A* suggests that a systematic
rotation is present for the early-type population. No figure rotation around
the Galactic center for the late type stars is supported by the new
observations.

sulfur (and in most cases neon and oxygen) in planetary nebulae in the Bulge
give the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time their progenitor

evolution of the Bulge. The abundances of Bulge planetary nebulae tend to be
slightly higher than those in the Disk on average, but they do not follow the
trend of the Disk planetary nebulae, thus confirming the difference between
Bulge and Disk evolution. Additionally, the Bulge planetary nebulae show
peculiar dust properties compared to the Disk nebulae. Oxygen-rich dust feature
(crystalline silicates) dominate the spectra of all of the Bulge planetary
nebulae; such features are more scarce in Disk nebulae. Additionally,
carbon-rich dust features (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) appear in roughly

depend on the escape rate and the amount of ionizing radiation emitted by the
star. These observations also provide a benchmark for other transiting planets,
in the frame of a comparative study of the evaporation state of close-in giant
planets. Eight HST orbits are used to observe two transits of HD209458b.
Transit light curves are obtained by performing photometry of the unresolved
stellar Lyman-alpha emission line during both transits. Absorption signatures
of exospheric hydrogen during the transit are compared to light curve models
predicting a hydrogen tail. Transit depths of (9.6 +/- 7.0)% and (5.3 +/-
10.0)% are measured on the whole Lyman-alpha line in visits 1 and 2,
respectively. Averaging data from both visits, we find an absorption depth of
(8.0 +/- 5.7)%, in good agreement with previous studies. The extended size of
the exosphere confirms that the planet is likely loosing hydrogen to space.
Yet, the photometric precision achieved does not allow us to better constrain
the hydrogen mass loss rate.

approximately aligned with the angular momentum vector of the binary, which can
be addressed by a future X-ray polarimetry mission.

ameliorate previous tension between cosmological constraints from the microwave

function of X-ray clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Velocity
segregation between galaxies and the underlying dark matter could cause virial
mass estimates to be biased, causing the mass scale of the mass function to be
offset from the true value. Modest velocity segregation
($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{DM}$=1.13$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$) is sufficient to match the
mass function to the Five-Year WMAP results. When the new WMAP results are
combined with constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations,
there is no need for velocity segregation
($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{DM}$=1.05$\pm$0.05). This result agrees with
expectations for velocity segregation from state-of-the-art numerical
simulations of clusters. Together with the improved agreement between the new
WMAP results and recent cosmic shear measurements, this result demonstrates
that the amplitude of large-scale structure in the nearby universe matches that
predicted from the structure seen in the microwave background. The new
constraint we place on velocity segregation in clusters indicates that virial

future cluster surveys will be able to probe both cosmological parameters and

Lyman-alpha forest is observed in redshift-space where distortions due to
Hubble expansion, bulk flows, and thermal broadening introduce anisotropy.
Similarly, a spectrograph's line spread function affects the autocorrelation
and cross-correlation differently. In this the second paper of a series on
using the Lyman-alpha forest observed in pairs of QSOs for a new application of
the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test, these anisotropies and related sources of
potential systematic error are investigated with cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations. Three prescriptions for galactic outflow were compared and found
to have only a marginal effect on the Lyman-alpha flux correlation (which
changed by at most 7% with use of the currently favored variable-momentum wind
model vs. no winds at all). An approximate solution for obtaining the zero-lag
cross-correlation corresponding to arbitrary spectral resolution directly from
the zero-lag cross-correlation computed at full-resolution (good to within 2%
at the scales of interest) is presented. Uncertainty in the observationally
determined mean flux decrement of the Lyman-alpha forest was found to be the
dominant source of systematic error; however, this is reduced significantly
when considering correlation ratios. We describe a simple scheme for
implementing our results, while mitigating systematic errors, in the context of
a future application of the AP test.

(there is only a smooth crossover). This result may have some implication for

extended tidal features such as bridge and tail that are all transient, but
distinct in nature. In the extended disks, strong tidal force is able to lock
the perturbed epicycle phases of the near-side particles to the perturber,
shaping them into a tidal bridge that corotates with the perturber. A tidal
tail develops at the opposite side as strongly-perturbed, near-side particles
overtake mildly-perturbed, far-side particles. The tail is essentially a narrow
material arm with a roughly logarithmic shape, dissolving with time because of
large velocity dispersions. Inside the disks where tidal force is relatively
weak, on the other hand, a two-armed logarithmic spiral pattern emerges due to
the kinematic alignment of perturbed particle orbits. While self-gravity makes
the spiral arms a bit stronger, the arms never become fully self-gravitating,
wind up progressively with time, and decay after the peak almost exponentially
in a time scale of ~ 1 Gyr. The arm pattern speed varying with both radius and
time converges to Omega-kappa/2 at late time, suggesting that the pattern speed
of tidally-driven arms may depend on radius in real galaxies. We present the
parametric dependences of various properties of tidal features on the tidal
strength, and discuss our findings in application to tidal spiral arms in
grand-design spiral galaxies. (Abridged)

provide new information on the boundary layers of their accreting white dwarfs.
Comparison of observations and models allows us to extract estimates for the
thermal conductivity in the accretion layer and reach conclusions on the
relevant physical processes. We calculate the structure of the dense thermal
boundary layer that forms under gravity and cooling at the white dwarf surface
on accretion of gas from a hot tenuous ADAF-type coronal inflow. The
distribution of density and temperature obtained allows us to calculate the
strength and spectrum of the emitted X-ray radiation. They depend strongly on
the values of thermal conductivity and mass accretion rate. We apply our model
to the dwarf nova system VW Hyi and compare the spectra predicted for different
values of the thermal conductivity with the observed spectrum. We find a
significant deviation for all values of thermal conductivity that are a sizable
fraction of the Spitzer conductivity. A good fit arises however for a
conductivity of about 1% of the Spitzer value. This also seems to hold for
other dwarf nova systems in quiescence. We compare this result with thermal
conduction in other astrophysical situations. The highly reduced thermal
conductivity in the boundary layer requires magnetic fields perpendicular to
the temperature gradient. Locating their origin in the accretion of magnetic
fields from the hot ADAF-type coronal flow we find that dynamical effects of
these fields will lead to a spatially intermittent, localized accretion
geometry at the white dwarf surface.

a regularization parameter of the Tikhonov regularization technique and some

the oscillator is highly excited. We find that the two-level system transition
energy is shifted, producing a Bloch-Siegert shift in each two-level system
similar to what would be obtained if the other were absent. At resonances
associated with energy exchange between a two-level system and the oscillator,
the level splitting is about the same as would be obtained in the spin-boson

with the transfer of excitation between one two-level system and the other, an
effect not present in the spin-boson model. We use a unitary transformation
leading to a rotated system in which terms responsible for the shift and

using operators that appear in the rotated Hamiltonian.

resolution of about 8 A in the FUV (1350 - 1750 A) and about 20 A in the NUV
(1950 - 2750 A) is used for a systematic search of Ly-a emitting galaxies at
low redshift. This aims at filling a gap between high-redshift surveys and a
small set of objects studied in detail in the nearby universe. A blind search
of 7018 spectra extracted in 5 deep exposures (5.65 sq.deg) has resulted in 96
Ly-a emitting galaxy candidates in the FUV domain, after accounting for
broad-line AGNs. The Ly-a EWs (equivalent width) are consistent with stellar
population model predictions and show no trends as a function of UV color or UV
luminosity, except a possible decrease in the most luminous that may be due to
small-number statistics. Their distribution in EW is similar to that at z about
3 but their fraction among star-forming galaxies is smaller. Avoiding uncertain
candidates, a sub-sample of 66 objects in the range 0.2 < z < 0.35 has been
used to build a Ly-a LF (luminosity function). The incompleteness due to
objects with significant Ly-a emission but a UV continuum too low for spectral
extraction has been evaluated. A comparison with H-a LF in the same redshift
domain is consistent with an average Ly-a/H-a of about 1 in about 15 % of the
star-forming galaxies. A comparison with high-redshift Ly-a LFs implies an
increase of the Ly-a luminosity density by a factor of about 16 from z about
0.3 to z about 3. By comparison with the factor 5 increase of the UV luminosity
density in the same redshift range, this suggests an increase of the average
Ly-a escape fraction with redshift.

semiparametric modeling. Variable selection for semiparametric regression
models consists of two components: model selection for nonparametric components
and selection of significant variables for the parametric portion. Thus,
semiparametric variable selection is much more challenging than parametric
variable selection (e.g., linear and generalized linear models) because
traditional variable selection procedures including stepwise regression and the
best subset selection now require separate model selection for the
nonparametric components for each submodel. This leads to a very heavy
computational burden. In this paper, we propose a class of variable selection
procedures for semiparametric regression models using nonconcave penalized
likelihood. We establish the rate of convergence of the resulting estimate.
With proper choices of penalty functions and regularization parameters, we show
the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimate and further demonstrate that
the proposed procedures perform as well as an oracle procedure. A
semiparametric generalized likelihood ratio test is proposed to select
significant variables in the nonparametric component. We investigate the
asymptotic behavior of the proposed test and demonstrate that its limiting null
distribution follows a chi-square distribution which is independent of the
nuisance parameters. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to
examine the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection
procedures.

MXAN analysis to the time-resolved XANES difference spectrum obtained between a
100 ps life-time photoexcited state of Ni(II)TMP (a relaxed triplet state, T1,
obtained by exciting the Soret band) and the ground state, S0. From our direct
simulation of the laser on/laser off difference spectrum, we obtain the
fraction of T1 population (0.41-0.63) A in agreement with optical transient
absorption determination, and a 0.05-0.1 A elongation of the d(Ni-N) and
d(Ni-C) distances. The overall uncertainty on these results mostly depends on
uncertainty on the chemical shift between the T1 and S0 state, that is assumed
a priori in the differential analysis. Still our results are in good agreement
with previous EXAFS data (obtained on a reconstructed absolute spectrum of the
T1 state). Our best fit corresponds to no chemical shift, 54% fraction of T1

(0.06 +/- 0.01) elongation of the average d(Ni-pyrrol) when pyrrol rings are

spectroscopy can be used to provide structural information on square-planar

been determined accurately in the literature, showing excellent agreement with
high resolution numerical simulations. However, this is not the case for the
conditional mass function (CMF). We propose a simple analytical procedure to
derive the CMF by rescaling the UMF to the constrained environment using the
appropriate mean and variance of the density field at the constrained point.
This method introduces two major modifications with respect to the standard
re-scaling procedure. First of all, rather than using in the scaling procedure
the properties of the environment averaged over all the conditioning region, we
implement the re-scaling locally. We show that for high masses this
modification may lead to substantially different results. Secondly, we modify
the (local) standard re-scaling procedure in such a manner as to force
normalisation, in the sense that when one integrates the CMF over all possible
values of the constraint multiplied by their corresponding probability
distribution, the UMF is recovered. In practise, we do this by replacing in the
standard procedure the value delta_c (the linear density contrast for collapse)
by certain adjustable effective parameter delta_eff. In order to test the
method, we compare our prescription with the results obtained from numerical
simulations in voids (Gottlober et al. 2003), finding a very good agreement.
Based on these results, we finally present a very accurate analytical fit to
the (accumulated) conditional mass function obtained with our procedure, which
may be useful for any theoretical treatment of the large scale structure.

exchange of the R ions due to their different ionic radii, i.e. chemical
pressure. This can be monitored in detail by measurements of the thermal
expansion, which is a highly sensitive probe for detecting spin-state
transitions. The Co ions in the higher spin state act as additional scattering
centers for phonons, therefore suppressing the phonon thermal conductivity.
Based on the analysis of the interplay between spin-state transition and heat
transport, we present a quantitative model of the thermal conductivity for the
entire series. In PrCoO_3, an additional scattering effect is active at low
temperatures. This effect arises from the crystal field splitting of the 4f
multiplet, which allows for resonant scattering of phonons between the various

testing the intersection null hypothesis is generalized to control the $k$-FWER
weakly, that is, under the intersection null hypothesis, and Hochberg's stepup

generalized to control the $k$-FWER strongly, that is, under any configuration

developed utilizing joint null distributions of the $k$-dimensional subsets of
the $p$-values, assumed to be identical. The generalized Simes' test is proved
to control the $k$-FWER weakly under the multivariate totally positive of order
two (MTP$_2$) condition [J. Multivariate Analysis 10 (1980) 467--498] of the

but also their outburst properties and possibly also their long-term evolution.
Irradiation during an outburst of the outer parts of the accretion disc in a
transient LMXB leads to drastic changes in the outburst properties. As far as
the secular evolution of such systems is concerned, these changes can result in
enhanced loss of mass and angular momentum from the system and, most important,
in neutron star LMXBs in a much less efficient use of the transferred matter to
spin up the neutron star to a ms-pulsar. Irradiation of the donor star can
destabilize mass transfer and lead to irradiation-driven mass transfer cycles,
i.e. to a secular evolution which differs drastically from an evolution in
which irradiation is ignored. It is argued that irradiation-driven mass
transfer cycles cannot occur in systems which are transient because of disc
instabilities, i.e. in particular in long-period LMXBs with a giant donor. It
is furthermore shown that for irradiating either the disc or the donor star,
direct irradiation alone is insufficient. Rather, indirect irradiation via
scattered accretion luminosity must play an important role in transient LMXBs
and is, in fact, necessary to destabilize mass transfer in short-period systems
by irradiating the donor star. Whether and to what extent irradiation in LMXBs
does change their secular evolution depends on a number of unsolved problems
which are briefly discussed at the end of this article.

coherently control a large quantum system well enough to perform an arbitrary

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) QIPs offer an excellent test-bed on which to
develop and benchmark tools and techniques to control quantum systems. Two main
issues to consider when designing control methods are accuracy and efficiency,
for which two complementary approaches have been developed so far to control
qubit registers with liquid-state NMR methods. The first applies optimal
control theory to numerically optimize the control fields to implement unitary
operations on low dimensional systems with high fidelity. The second technique
is based on the efficient optimization of a sequence of imperfect control
elements so that implementation of a full quantum algorithm is possible while
minimizing error accumulation. This article summarizes our work in implementing
both of these methods. Furthermore, we show that taken together, they form a
basis to design quantum-control methods for a block-architecture QIP so that
large system size is not a barrier to implementing optimal control techniques.

then discards these troublesome components probabilistically by using the
fitness measure, and the Mutation step follows to further discard a small
number of components at random. After the above steps, an input solution
becomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired.
The repair is carried out by using the Prioritization step to first produce
priorities that determine an order by which the following Construction step
then schedules the remaining components. Therefore, the optimisation in the
ISWO is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and an iterative
constructive repair process performed. Encouraging experimental results are
reported.

presented for personnel scheduling based on choosing a suitable scheduling rule
from a set for each persons assignment. Unlike our previous work of using
genetic algorithms whose learning is implicit, the learning in both approaches
is explicit, i.e. we are able to identify building blocks directly. To achieve
this target, the Bayesian optimization algorithm builds a Bayesian network of
the joint probability distribution of the rules used to construct solutions,
while the adapted classifier system assigns each rule a strength value that is
constantly updated according to its usefulness in the current situation.
Computational results from 52 real data instances of nurse scheduling
demonstrate the success of both approaches. It is also suggested that the
learning mechanism in the proposed approaches might be suitable for other
scheduling problems.

supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model with target a bihermitian space with
torsion. For the special case in which the two complex structures commute, we
show that the action is a Q-exact term plus a quasi-topological term. The
quasi-topological term is locally given by a closed two-form which corresponds
to a flat gerbe-connection and generalises the usual topological term of the
A-model. Exponentiating it gives a Wilson surface, which can be regarded as a
generalization of a Wilson line. This makes the quantum theory globally
well-defined.

a connected semisimple K-group and L is a connected maximal semisimple
K-subgroup of G with finite index in its normalizer.
  Assuming that G(K_v) acts transitively on U(K_v) for almost all places v of
K, we obtain the asymptotic of the number of rational points in U(K) with
height bounded by T, and settle new cases of Manin's conjecture for many
wonderful varieties. The main ingredient of our approach is the
equidistribution of semisimple adelic periods, which is established using the
theory of unipotent flows.
