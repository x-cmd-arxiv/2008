universe to be a 4-dimensional surface (the ""brane"") embedded in a
higher-dimensional curved spacetime (the ""bulk""). In such braneworld gravity
models with infinitely large extra dimensions, black holes evaporate fast
through the emission of the additional gravitational degrees of freedom,
resulting in lifetimes of stellar-mass black holes that are significantly
smaller than the Hubble time. We show that the predicted evaporation rate leads
to a change in the orbital period of X-ray binaries harboring black holes that
is observable with current instruments. We obtain an upper limit on the rate of
change of the orbital period of the binary A0620-00 and use it to constrain the
asymptotic curvature radius of the extra dimension to a value comparable to the
one obtained by table-top experiments. Furthermore we argue that any
measurement of a period increase for low-mass X-ray binaries with a high mass
ratio is evidence for new physics beyond general relativity and the standard
model.

stellar radiation, advect this energy, then reradiate photons in preferential
directions. Those photons carry away momentum, applying a force on the planet.
Here we evaluate the resulting secular changes to the orbit, known as the
Yarkovsky effect. For known transiting planets, typical fractional changes in
semi-major axis are about 1% over their lifetime, but could be up to ~5% for
close-in planets like OGLE-TR-56b or inflated planets like TrES-4. We discuss
the origin of the correlation between semi-major axis and surface gravity of
transiting planets in terms of various physical processes, finding that
radiative thrusters are too weak by about a factor of 10 to establish the lower

database presented in a companion paper to perform a comprehensive appraisal of
the cold gas content in active galaxies and to seek new strategies to
investigate the global properties of the host galaxies and their relationship
to their central black holes (BHs). We show that the BH mass obeys a strong,
roughly linear relation with the host galaxy's dynamical mass. BH mass follows
a looser, though still highly significant, correlation with the maximum
rotation velocity of the galaxy, as expected from the known scaling between
rotation velocity and central velocity dispersion. Neither of these H I-based
correlations is as tight as the more familiar relations between BH mass and
bulge luminosity or velocity dispersion, but they offer the advantage of being
insensitive to the glare of the nucleus and therefore are promising new tools
for probing the host galaxies of both nearby and distant AGNs. We present
evidence for substantial ongoing BH growth in the most actively accreting AGNs.
In these nearby systems, BH growth appears to be delayed with respect to the
assembly of the host galaxy but otherwise has left no detectable perturbation
to its mass-to-light ratio or its global gas content. The host galaxies of type
1 AGNs, including those luminous enough to qualify as quasars, are generally
gas-rich systems, possessing a cold interstellar medium reservoir at least as
abundant as that in inactive galaxies of the same morphological type. This
calls into question current implementations of AGN feedback in models of galaxy
formation that predict strong cold gas depletion in unobscured AGNs. (Abridged)

subsequent orbital evolution of giant planets embedded in a circumbinary disc.
We assume that a 20 earth masses core has migrated to the edge of the inner
cavity formed by the binary where it remains trapped by corotation torques.
This core is then allowed to accrete gas from the disc, and we study its
orbital evolution as it grows in mass. For each of the two accretion time
scales we considered, we performed three simulations. In two of the three
simulations, we stop the accretion onto the planet once its mass becomes
characteristic of that of Saturn or Jupiter. In the remaining case, the planet
can accrete disc material freely in such a way that its mass becomes higher
than Jupiter's. The simulations show different outcomes depending on the final
mass m_p of the giant. For m_p=1 M_S (where M_S is Saturn's mass), we find that
the planet migrates inward through its interaction with the disc until its
eccentricity becomes high enough to induce a torque reversal. The planet then
migrates outward, and the system remains stable on long time scales. For m_p >
1 M_J (where M_J is Jupiter's mass) we observed two different outcomes. In each
case the planet enters the 4:1 resonance with the binary, and resonant
interaction drives up the eccentricity of the planet until it undergoes a close
encounter with the secondary star. The result can either be ejection from the
system or scattering out into the disc followed by a prolonged period of
outward migration. These results suggest that circumbinary planets are more
likely to be quite common in the Saturn-mass range. Jupiter-mass circumbinary
planets are likely to be less common because of their less stable evolution.

crucial use of features--such as Poincare invariance and the existence of a

to generalize the formulation of quantum field theory to arbitrary globally
hyperbolic curved spacetimes, it is essential that the theory be formulated in
an entirely local and covariant manner, without assuming the presence of a
preferred state. We propose a new framework for quantum field theory, in which
the existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is elevated to a
fundamental status, and, in essence, all of the properties of the quantum field
theory are determined by its OPE. We provide general axioms for the OPE
coefficients of a quantum field theory. These include a local and covariance
assumption (implying that the quantum field theory is locally and covariantly
constructed from the spacetime metric), a microlocal spectrum condition, an
""associativity"" condition, and the requirement that the coefficient of the

[FeII] narrow-band imaging, high resolution spectroscopy of the 1-0S(1) line
(2.12 um), NIR (0.9-2.5 um) low resolution spectroscopy, along with ISO-SWS and
LWS spectra (from 2.4 to 200 um). The flow shows a complex morphology. In
addition to the large-scale jet precession presented in previous studies, we
detect a small-scale wiggling close to the source, that may indicate the
presence of a multiple system. The peak radial velocities of the H2 knots range
from -42 to -14 km s^-1 in the blue lobe, and from -8 to 47 km s^-1 in the red
lobe. The low resolution spectra are rich in H_2 emission, and relatively faint
[FeII] (NIR), [OI] and [CII] (FIR) emission is observed in the region close to
the source. A warm H2 gas component has an average excitation temperature that
ranges between 2000 K and 2500 K. Additionally, the ISO-SWS spectrum reveals
the presence of a cold component (520 K), that strongly contributes to the
radiative cooling of the flow and plays a major role in the dynamics of the
flow. The estimated L(H2) of the jet is 8.2+/-0.7 L_sun, suggesting that
IRAS20126+4104 has an accretion rate significantly increased compared to
low-mass YSOs. This is also supported by the derived mass flux rate from the H2
lines (Mflux(H2)~7.5x10^-4 M_sun yr^-1). The comparison between the H2 and the
outflow parameters strongly indicates that the jet is driving, at least
partially, the outflow. As already found for low-mass protostellar jets, the
measured H2 outflow luminosity is tightly related to the source bolometric
luminosity.

microwave signals with device-compatible output power levels can be generated
from a single magnetic tunnel junction with a lateral size of 100 nm, seven

find that in MgO magnetic tunnel junctions the perpendicular torque induced by
the spin-polarized current on the local magnetization can reach 25% of the
in-plane spin-torque term, while exhibiting a different bias-dependence. Both

emission that is sometimes observed prior to the so-called flare continuum
emission. Fast-drift structures and continuum bursts are also observed in
association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), not only flares. Methods: We
analyse radio spectral features and images acquired at radio, H-alpha, EUV, and
soft X-ray wavelengths, during an event close to the solar limb on 2 June 2003.
Results: The fast-drifting decimetric-metric radio burst corresponds to a
moving, wide emission front in the radio images, which is normally interpreted
as a signature of a propagating shock wave. A decimetric-metric type II burst
where only the second harmonic lane is visible could explain the observations.
After long-lasting activity in the active region, the hot and dense loops could
be absorbing or suppressing emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. The
observed burst speed suggests a super-Alfvenic velocity for the burst driver.
The expanding and opening loops, associated with the flare and the early phase
of CME lift-off, could be driving the shock. Alternatively, an instantaneous
but fast loop expansion could initiate a freely propagating shock wave. The
later, complex-looking decametre-hectometre wave type III bursts indicate the
existence of a propagating shock, although no interplanetary type II burst was
observed during the event. The data does not support CME bow shock or a shock
at the flanks of the CME as the origin of the fast-drift decimetric-metric
radio source. Therefore super-Alfvenic loop expansion is the best candidate for
the initiation of the shock wave, and this result challenges the current view
of metric/coronal shocks originating either in the flanks of CMEs or from flare
blast waves.

present work is that the magnetic field has an arbitrary angle with respect to

of plasma (at the entrance to the cooling zone) occurs in a fast

we use ""real"" and ""power-law"" radiative functions. We determine the
stability/instability of the radiative shock wave as a function of parameters
of the incoming flow: velocity, strength of the magnetic field, and its
inclination to the surface of the star. In a number of simulation runs with the

theme in communication and computation, for example between processing entities

great effort must be taken to protect the integrity of a fragile quantum bit.
Nuclear spins are known to benefit from long coherence times compared to
electron spins, but are slow to manipulate and suffer from weak thermal
polarisation. A powerful model for quantum computation is thus one in which
electron spins are used for processing and readout while nuclear spins are used
for storage. Here we demonstrate the coherent transfer of a superposition state
in an electron spin 'processing' qubit to a nuclear spin 'memory' qubit, using
a combination of microwave and radiofrequency pulses applied to 31P donors in
an isotopically pure 28Si crystal. The electron spin state can be stored in the
nuclear spin on a timescale that is long compared with the electron decoherence
time and then coherently transferred back to the electron spin, thus
demonstrating the 31P nuclear spin as a solid-state quantum memory. The overall
store/readout fidelity is about 90%, attributed to systematic imperfections in
radiofrequency pulses which can be improved through the use of composite
pulses. We apply dynamic decoupling to protect the nuclear spin quantum memory
element from sources of decoherence. The coherence lifetime of the quantum
memory element is found to exceed one second at 5.5K.

Gilbert network grows essentially as $n^{\alpha(\beta)}$, where $\alpha(\beta)

\frac{\beta}{2}$ on ${1/2} \leq \beta < 1$. This quantity is an upper bound in
the worst case (of vertex positions), and a lower bound under mild regularity
assumptions. Essentially the same bounds hold if we constrain the network to be
efficient in the sense that average route-length is only $1 + o(1)$ times
average straight line length. The transition at $\beta = {1/2}$ corresponds to
the dominant cost contribution changing from short links to long links. The
upper bounds arise in the following type of hierarchical networks, which are
therefore optimal in an order of magnitude sense. On the large scale, use a
sparse Poisson line process to provide long-range links. On the medium scale,
use hierachical routing on the square lattice. On the small scale, link
vertices directly to medium-grid points. We discuss one of many possible

XTE J1810-197 following its 2002 outburst presents a unique opportunity to

magnitude of the pulsar's modulation in narrow spectral bands over time.
Following previous work, we assume that the post-outburst flux is produced in
two distinct thermal components arising from a hot spot and a warm concentric
ring. We include general relativistic effects on the blackbody spectra due to
gravitational redshift and light bending near the stellar surface, which
strongly depend on radius. This affects the model fits for the temperature and
size of the emission regions. For the hot spot, the observed temporal and
energy-dependent pulse modulation is found to require an anisotropic,
pencil-beamed radiation pattern. We are able to constrain an allowed range for
the angles that the line-of-sight (psi) and the hot spot pole (xi) make with
respect to the spin-axis. Within errors, this is defined by the locus of points
in the xi-psi plane that lie along the line (xi+beta(R))(psi+beta(R)) ~
constant, where beta(R) is a function of the radius R of the star. For a
canonical value of R=12 km, the viewing parameters range from psi=xi=37 deg to
(psi,xi)=(85 deg,15 deg). We discuss our results in the context of magnetar

interior properties of stars. We use 2D stellar models and a 2D finite
difference integration of the linearized pulsation equations to calculate
non-radial oscillations. This approach allows us to directly calculate the
pulsation modes for a distorted rotating star without treating the rotation as
a perturbation. We are also able to express the finite difference solution in
the horizontal direction as a sum of multiple spherical harmonics for any given
mode. Using these methods, we have investigated the effects of increasing
rotation and the number of spherical harmonics on the calculated
eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions and compared the results to perturbation
theory. In slowly rotating stars, current methods work well, and we show that
the eigenfunction can be accurately modelled using 2nd order perturbation
theory and a single spherical harmonic. We use 10 Msun models with velocities
ranging from 0 to 420 km/s (0.89 Omega_c) and examine low order p modes. We
find that one spherical harmonic remains reasonable up to a rotation rate
around 300km s^{-1} (0.69 Omega_c) for the radial fundamental mode, but can
fail at rotation rates as low as 90 km/s (0.23 Omega_c) for the 2H mode or l =
2 p_2 mode, based on the eigenfrequencies alone. Depending on the mode in
question, a single spherical harmonic may fail at lower rotation rates if the
shape of the eigenfunction is taken into consideration. Perturbation theory, in
contrast, remains valid up to relatively high rotation rates for most modes. We
find the lowest failure surface equatorial velocity is 120 km/s (0.30 Omega_c)
for the l = 2 p_2 mode, but failure velocities between 240 and 300 km/s
(0.58-0.69 Omega_c)are more typical.

for the simplified cloak based on linear transformations, the back scattering
has a similar level to the case of a PEC cylinder without any cloak, rendering
the object still being `visible'. It is also demonstrated numerically that the

Like in the case of binary pulsars, the relativistic gravity effects are
considerably larger than in the solar system. For instance the observed orbital
precession is forty degrees per period. The gravitational radiation energy
losses are comparable to typical blazar electromagnetic radiation emission and
it is about ten orders larger than that of the binary pulsar with significant
orbit shrinking already apparent in the light curves. This already tests
Einstein gravity to a few percent for objects at cosmological distances.

both superfluid and (spin and charge) density fluctuations within the

theory satisfies the required particle-hole symmetry over the entire BCS-BEC

superfluid fluctuations near the half-filling, leading to the suppression of
Tc. As a result, the maximum Tc is obtained away the half-filling. Since the
strong density fluctuations originate from the nesting property of the Fermi

fully three dimensional (3-D) numerical simulations. We consider hydrodynamics
of inviscid accretion flows. We assume a spherically symmetric density
distribution at the outer boundary, but brake the flow symmetry by introducing
a small, latitude-dependent angular momentum. We also consider cases where
angular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the
latitude-dependent angular momentum, 3-D simulations confirm axisymmetric
results: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a
thick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the
polar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by
the size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3-D
simulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric
conditions at large radii. For the latitude and azimuth-dependent angular
momentum, the non-rotating gas near the equator can also significantly affect
the evolution of the rotating gas. In particular, it may prevent the formation
of a proper torus (i.e. its closing, in the azimuthal direction). In such
models, the mass accretion rate is only slightly less than the corresponding
Bondi rate.

derived for the case of a sample-fitted generalized linear model, from which
the post-strata are constructed by dividing the range of the model predictions
into predetermined intervals. Design consistency of the endogenous
post-stratification estimator is established under mild conditions. Under a
superpopulation model, consistency and asymptotic normality of the endogenous
post-stratification estimator are established, showing that it has the same
asymptotic variance as the traditional post-stratified estimator with fixed
strata. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the practical effect of first
fitting a model to the survey data before post-stratifying is small, even for
relatively small sample sizes.

scheme between $1^1P_1$ and $1^3P_1$ is favored with a mixing angle
$\phi\simeq-(55\pm 5)^\circ$, which is consistent with previous theoretical
predictions. The same mixing scheme also applies to $D_{s1}(2460)$ and
$D_{s1}(2536)$ that accounts for the narrow width of the $D_{s1}(2536)$ and its
dominant decay into $D^*K$. For $B_1(5725)$ and $B_1^\prime(5732)$, such a
mixing explains well the decay width of the former but leads to an even broader
$B_1^\prime(5732)$. Predictions for the strange-bottom axial vectors are also
made. For the undetermined meson $D^*(2640)$, we find that they fit in well the
radially excited state $2^3S_1$ according to its decay mode. The newly observed

domain from mature pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) scales as the change in rotational
kinetic energy $I(\Omega_0^2-\Omega^2)/2$ since birth, rather than the present
day spindown power $I\Omega\dot{\Omega}$. This finding holds as long as the
lifetime of inverse Compton emitting electrons exceeds the age of the system.
For a typical $\gamma^{-2}$ electron spectrum, the predicted flux depends
mostly on the pulsar birth period, conversion efficiency of spindown power to
relativistic electrons and distance to the PWN, so that first order estimates
of the birth period can be assessed from {\it GLAST/LAT} observations of PWN.
For this purpose we derive an analytical expression. The associated
(``uncooled'') photon spectral index in the GeV domain is expected to cluster
around $\sim 1.5$, which is bounded at low energies by an intrinsic spectral
break, and at higher energies by a second spectral break where the photon index
steepens to $\sim 2$ due to radiation losses. Mature PWN are expected to have
expanded to sizes larger than currently known PWN, resulting in relatively low
magnetic energy densities and hence survival of GeV inverse Compton emitting
electrons. Whereas such a PWN may be radio and X-ray quiet in synchrotron
radiation, it may still be detectable as a {\it GLAST/LAT} source as a result
of the relic electrons in the PWN.

Asymptotically, it is possible to correctly estimate the number of jumps with
probability one. Given that the number of jumps is correctly estimated, we show
that the corresponding parameter estimates of the jump locations and jump
heights are $n^{-1/2}$ consistent and converge to a joint normal distribution
with covariance structure depending on $\phi$, and that this rate is minimax

design and nonparametric heteroscedastic LM moving average errors. In the
simple linear regression model, the first-order asymptotic distribution of the
least square estimator of the slope parameter is observed to be degenerate.
However, in the second order, this estimator is $n^{1/2}$-consistent and
asymptotically normal for $h+H<3/2$; nonnormal otherwise, where $h$ and $H$ are
LM parameters of design and error processes, respectively. The
finite-dimensional asymptotic distributions of a class of kernel type
estimators of the conditional variance function $\sigma^2(x)$ in a more general
heteroscedastic regression model are found to be normal whenever $H<(1+h)/2$,
and non-normal otherwise. In addition, in this general model,
$\log(n)$-consistency of the local Whittle estimator of $H$ based on pseudo
residuals and consistency of a cross validation type estimator of $\sigma^2(x)$
are established. All of these findings are then used to propose a lack-of-fit
test of a parametric regression model, with an application to some currency
exchange rate data which exhibit LM.

asymptotically tight estimates of the largest constraint density for which they
have solutions. At the same time, all known polynomial-time algorithms for many
of these problems already completely fail to find solutions at much smaller
densities. For example, it is well-known that it is easy to color a random
graph using twice as many colors as its chromatic number. Indeed, some of the
simplest possible coloring algorithms already achieve this goal. Given the
simplicity of those algorithms, one would expect there is a lot of room for
improvement. Yet, to date, no algorithm is known that uses $(2-\epsilon) \chi$
colors, in spite of efforts by numerous researchers over the years.
  In view of the remarkable resilience of this factor of 2 against every
algorithm hurled at it, we believe it is natural to inquire into its origin. We
do so by analyzing the evolution of the set of $k$-colorings of a random graph,
viewed as a subset of $\{1,...,k\}^{n}$, as edges are added. We prove that the
factor of 2 corresponds in a precise mathematical sense to a phase transition
in the geometry of this set. Roughly, the set of $k$-colorings looks like a
giant ball for $k \ge 2 \chi$, but like an error-correcting code for $k \le
(2-\epsilon) \chi$. We prove that a completely analogous phase transition also
occurs both in random $k$-SAT and in random hypergraph 2-coloring. And that for
each problem, its location corresponds precisely with the point were all known
polynomial-time algorithms fail. To prove our results we develop a general
technique that allows us to prove rigorously much of the celebrated 1-step
Replica-Symmetry-Breaking hypothesis of statistical physics for random CSPs.

allows solving the discrete logarithm problem efficiently if the group order is

avoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on
cyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be
adapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain
infrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result
by M\""uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from
hyperelliptic function fields.
  We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic
infrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from
certain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain
cyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the
Pohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a
computationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an
algorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain
requirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether
the Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number
fields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic
infrastructures.

alternating exchange bias stripes. The lateral structure is imprinted into a
continuous ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic exchange-bias bi-layer via laterally
selective exposure to He-ion irradiation in an applied field. This creates an
alternating frozen-in interfacial exchange bias field competing with the
external field in the course of the re-magnetization. It was found that in a
magnetic field applied at an angle with respect to the exchange bias axis
parallel to the stripes the re-magnetization process proceeds via a variety of
different stages. They include coherent rotation of magnetization towards the

of a stripe-like alternation of the magnetization, and development of a state
in which the magnetization forms large hyper-domains comprising a number of
stripes. Each of those magnetic states is quantitatively characterized via the

supernova (SN) 2006jc obtained with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
(UKIRT), the Gemini North Telescope, and the Spitzer Space Telescope between
days 86 and 493 post-explosion. We find that the IR behaviour of SN 2006jc can
be explained as a combination of IR echoes from two manifestations of
circumstellar material. The bulk of the near-IR emission arises from an IR echo
from newly-condensed dust in a cool dense shell (CDS) produced by the
interaction of the ejecta outward shock with a dense shell of circumstellar
material ejected by the progenitor in a luminous blue variable (LBV) like
outburst about two years prior to the SN explosion. The CDS dust mass reaches a
modest 3.0 x 10^(-4) M(solar) by day 230. While dust condensation within a CDS
formed behind the ejecta inward shock has been proposed before for one event
(SN 1998S), SN 2006jc is the first one showing evidence for dust condensation
in a CDS formed behind the ejecta outward shock in the circumstellar material.
At later epochs, a substantial and growing contribution to the IR fluxes arises
from an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the progenitor wind. The mass of the
pre-existing CSM dust is at least ~8 x 10^(-3) M(solar). This work therefore
adds to the evidence that mass-loss from the progenitors of core-collapse
supernovae could be a major source of dust in the universe. However, yet again,
we see no direct evidence that the explosion of a supernova produces anything
other than a very modest amount of dust.

Kilometre Array (SKA), will see the entire sky, hence the standard approach to

plane approximation that is valid only for small fields of view. We derive
interferometric formulations in real, spherical harmonic and wavelet space that
include contributions over the entire sky and do not rely on any tangent plane
approximations. A fast wavelet method is developed to simulate the visibilities
observed by an interferometer in the full-sky setting. Computing visibilities
using the fast wavelet method adapts to the sparse representation of the
primary beam and sky intensity in the wavelet basis. Consequently, the fast
wavelet method exhibits superior computational complexity to the real and
spherical harmonic space methods and may be performed at substantially lower
computational cost, while introducing only negligible error to simulated
visibilities. Low-resolution interferometric observations are simulated using
all of the methods to compare their performance, demonstrating that the fast
wavelet method is approximately three times faster that the other methods for
these low-resolution simulations. The computational burden of the real and
spherical harmonic space methods renders these techniques computationally
infeasible for higher resolution simulations. High-resolution interferometric
observations are simulated using the fast wavelet method only, demonstrating
and validating the application of this method to realistic simulations. The
fast wavelet method is estimated to provide a greater than ten-fold reduction

runs in polylogarithmic number of rounds in the size of the network and
constructs a linear size, lightweight, (1+\epsilon)-spanner for any given

unit ball graph (\alpha-UBG), which is a higher dimensional generalization of
the standard unit disk graph (UDG) model. The d-dimensional \alpha-UBG model
goes beyond the unrealistic ``flat world'' assumption of UDGs and also takes
into account transmission errors, fading signal strength, and physical
obstructions. The main result in the paper is this: for any fixed \epsilon > 0,
0 < \alpha \le 1, and d \ge 2, there is a distributed algorithm running in
O(\log n \log^* n) communication rounds on an n-node, d-dimensional \alpha-UBG
G that computes a (1+\epsilon)-spanner G' of G with maximum degree \Delta(G') =
O(1) and total weight w(G') = O(w(MST(G)). This result is motivated by the
topology control problem in wireless ad-hoc networks and improves on existing
topology control algorithms along several dimensions. The technical
contributions of the paper include a new, sequential, greedy algorithm with
relaxed edge ordering and lazy updating, and clustering techniques for
