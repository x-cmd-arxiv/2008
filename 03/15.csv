frequency components. When the wave amplitude exceeds the critical threshold,
an abrupt onset of Bloch-like oscillations causes negative differential
velocity. The acoustic wave also affects the collective behavior of the
electrons by causing the formation of localised electron accumulation and
depletion regions, which propagate through the superlattice, thereby producing
self-sustained current oscillations even for very small wave amplitudes. We
show that the underlying single-electron dynamics, in particular the transition
between the acoustic wave dragging and Bloch oscillation regimes, strongly
influence the spatial distribution of the electrons and the form of the current
oscillations. In particular, the amplitude of the current oscillations depends
non-monotonically on the strength of the acoustic wave, reflecting the

logarithmically with the size. Measurements in highly oriented pyrolytic

Furthermore, we present an experimental method that allows us to obtain the
carriers mean free path $l(T)$, the Fermi wavelength $\lambda(T)$ and the
mobility $\mu(T)$ directly from experiments without adjustable parameters.
Measuring the electrical resistance through microfabricated constrictions in
HOPG and observing the transition from ohmic to ballistic regime we obtain that
$0.2 \mu$m $\lesssim l \lesssim 10 \mu$m, $0.1 \mu$m $\lesssim \lambda \lesssim
2 \mu$m and a mobility $5 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/Vs $ \lesssim \mu \lesssim 4

queries on a static database. Application scenarios of probabilistic databases
however often involve the conditioning of a database using additional

transform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic
database which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further
refinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to
the problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.
  It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has
led researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence
computation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can
be solved using such techniques.
  In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems. We study
several problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most
successful search techniques from constraint satisfaction, such as the
Davis-Putnam algorithm. We complement this with a thorough experimental
evaluation of the algorithms proposed. Our experiments show that our exact
algorithms scale well to realistic database sizes and can in some scenarios
compete with the most efficient previous approximation algorithms.

find a sequence of correlations, starting with a positive correlation between
the radio and soft X-ray fluxes in the hard spectral state, changing to a
negative one at the transition to soft spectral states. The temporal evolution
can be in either direction on that sequence, unless the source goes into a very
weak radio state, from which it can return only following a major radio flare.
The flare decline is via relatively bright radio states, which results in a
hysteresis loop on the flux-flux diagram. We also study the hard X-ray light
curve, and find its overall anticorrelation with the soft X-rays. During major
radio flares, the radio flux responds exponentially to the level of a hard
X-ray high-energy tail. We also specify the detailed correspondence between the
radio states and the X-ray spectral states. We compare our results to those of
black-hole and neutron-star binaries. Except for the effect of strong
absorption and the energy of the high-energy break in the hard state, the X-ray
spectral states of Cyg X-3 closely correspond to the canonical X-ray states of
black-hole binaries. Also, the radio/X-ray correlation closely corresponds to
that found in black-hole binaries, but it significantly differs from that in
neutron-star binaries. Overall, our results strongly support the presence of a
black hole in Cyg X-3.

evidence for a change in the velocity dispersion with radius. We place strong
limits, few percent, on the existence of counter-rotating gas out to 1.5 R_25.
These results suggest that thin disks extend well beyond R_25; however, we also
find a few puzzling anomalies. In ESO 323-G033 we find two emission regions
that have velocities close to the systemic velocity rather than the expected
rotation velocity. These low relative velocities are unlikely to be simply due
to projection effects and so suggest that these regions are not on disk-plane,
circular orbits. In MCG-01-31-002 we find emission from gas with a large
velocity dispersion that is co-rotating with the inner disk.

the metallicity of the LIRG sample is nearly constant, we can rule out this

attributed to two effects: age and PAH features. The L_8micron/L_Pa-alpha
ratio, which varies by a factor of ten for the LIRG HII regions, is reproduced
by a model with instantaneous star formation and ages ranging from ~ 4 to 7.5

probably due to differential contributions of the PAH features (the 8.6 micron,

where $a$ is the scale factor, $D$ is the growth rate of structure,
$\Omega_m(a)$ is the matter density parameter, and $\gamma$ is a simple
function of redshift.
  We show that it can be expressed entirely in terms of the bias factor,
$b(a)$, (measured from cross-correlations with CMB lensing) and the amplitude
of redshift space distortions, $\beta(k,a)$. Measurements of the CMB power
spectrum determine $\Omega_{m 0} H_0^2$. If dark energy within GR is the
solution to the cosmic acceleration problem, then the logarithmic growth rate
of structure $d \ln D / d \ln a = \Omega_m^\gamma$. Thus, $\epsilon(k,a) =0$ on
linear scales to better than 1%. We show that in the class of Modified Gravity
models known as $f(R)$, the growth rate has a different dependence on scale and
redshift.
  By combining measurements of the amplitude of $\beta$ and of the bias, $b$,
redshift surveys will be able to determine the logarithmic growth rate as a
function of scale and redshift. We estimate the predicted sensitivity of the
proposed SDSS III (BOSS) survey and the proposed ADEPT mission and find that
they will test structure growth in General Relativity to the percent level.

galaxy is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling, once the
virial temperature exceeds 10^4 K, and its ability to retain photoheated gas.
We follow the complex accretion and star formation history of a 5*10^7 M_sun
system by means of a detailed merger tree and derive an upper limit on the
number of Population III (Pop III) stars formed prior to its assembly. We
investigate the thermal and chemical evolution of infalling gas and find that
partial ionization at temperatures > 10^4 K catalyses the formation of H2 and
hydrogen deuteride, allowing the gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic
microwave background. Depending on the strength of radiative and chemical
feedback, primordial star formation might be dominated by intermediate-mass Pop
III stars formed during the assembly of the first galaxies. Accretion on to the
nascent galaxy begins with hot accretion, where gas is accreted directly from
the intergalactic medium and shock-heated to the virial temperature, but is
quickly accompanied by a phase of cold accretion, where the gas cools in
filaments before flowing into the parent halo with high velocities. The latter
drives supersonic turbulence at the centre of the galaxy and could lead to very
efficient chemical mixing. The onset of turbulence in the first galaxies thus
likely marks the transition to Pop II star formation.

evolution, and in addition, the Poisson equation, which relates the density
perturbations to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, is changed, due
to the violation of the scaling rho ~ a^{-3} of the matter density rho with

matter decays into dark energy, investigate the influence of the dark matter

assembly history of dark matter halos and the age dependence of halo

characterize the different aspects of the assembly history of a dark matter
halo. We find that these formation times have different dependence on halo
mass. While some formation times characterize well the hierarchical nature of
halo formation, in the sense that more massive halos have later formation, the
trend is reversed for other definitions of the formation time. In particular,
the formation times that are likely to be related to the formation of galaxies
in dark halos show strong trends of ``down-sizing'', in that lower-mass halos
form later. We also investigate how the correlation amplitude of dark matter
halos depends on the different formation times. We find that this dependence is
quite strong for some definitions of formation time but weak or absent for
other definitions. In particular, the correlation amplitude of halos of a given
mass is almost independent of their last major merger time. For the definitions
that are expected to be more related to the formation of galaxies in dark
halos, a significant assembly bias is found only for halos less massive than
M_*. We discuss our results in connection to the hierarchical assembly of dark

We use the calculus of variations to determine the minimal additive forcing
function that induces a desired terminal response, such as an energy in the
case of a physical system. We include the additional constraint that only
select degrees of freedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of
problems in which not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system
are accessible to forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a
fundamental physical role as the effective forcing experienced by the degrees
of freedom which are not forced directly. Furthermore, we find that the product
of the displacement of nearby trajectories and the effective total forcing
function is a conserved quantity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
methodology with several examples.

a study of some striking statistical properties of cyber-risks that quantify
the distribution and time evolution of information risks on the Internet, to
understand their mechanisms, and create opportunities to mitigate, control,
predict and insure them at a global scale. First, we report an exceptionnaly
stable power-law tail distribution of personal identity losses per event, ${\rm
Pr}({\rm ID loss} \geq V) \sim 1/V^b$, with $b =0.7 \pm 0.1$. This result is
robust against a surprising strong non-stationary growth of ID losses
culminating in July 2006 followed by a more stationary phase. Moreover, this
distribution is identical for different types and sizes of targeted
organizations. Since $b<1$, the cumulative number of all losses over all events
up to time $t$ increases faster-than-linear with time according to
$\mathbf{\simeq t^{1/b}}$, suggesting that privacy, characterized by personal
identities, is necessarily becoming more and more insecure. We also show the
existence of a size effect, such that the largest possible ID losses per event
grow faster-than-linearly as $\sim S^{1.3}$ with the organization size $S$. The
small value $b \simeq 0.7$ of the power law distribution of ID losses is
explained by the interplay between Zipf's law and the size effect. We also
infer that compromised entities exhibit basically the same probability to incur
a small or large loss.

the frequencies, amplitudes, and lifetimes of the global modes of stellar

depends on the total length (T), quality, and completeness of the observations.
Except in a few simple cases, the effect of gaps in the data on measurement
precision is poorly understood, in particular in Fourier space where the
convolution of the observable with the observation window introduces
correlations between different frequencies. Here we describe and implement a
rather general method to retrieve maximum likelihood estimates of the
oscillation parameters, taking into account the proper statistics of the
observations. Our fitting method applies in complex Fourier space and exploits
the phase information. We consider both solar-like stochastic oscillations and
long-lived harmonic oscillations, plus random noise. Using numerical
simulations, we demonstrate the existence of cases for which our improved
fitting method is less biased and has a greater precision than when the
frequency correlations are ignored. This is especially true of low
signal-to-noise solar-like oscillations. For example, we discuss a case where
the precision on the mode frequency estimate is increased by a factor of five,
for a duty cycle of 15%. In the case of long-lived sinusoidal oscillations, a
proper treatment of the frequency correlations does not provide any significant
improvement; nevertheless we confirm that the mode frequency can be measured
from gapped data at a much better precision than the 1/T Rayleigh resolution.

accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce
significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and

thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of
an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk,
and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion
that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although

circumnuclear disk (CND), taking into account the mass-supply from a host
galaxy and the physical states of CND. In the model, two distinct accretion
modes depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a key role on
accreting gas to a SMBH. (i) If the CMD is gravitationally unstable, energy
feedback from supernovae (SNe) supports a geometrically thick, turbulent gas
disk. The accretion in this mode is dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is
significantly larger than that in the mode (ii), i.e., the CMD is supported by
gas pressure. Once the gas supply from the host is stopped, the high accretion
phase ($\sim 0.01- 0.1 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$) changes to the low one (mode
(ii), $\sim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$), but there is a delay with $\sim
10^{8}$ yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND turns into the gas poor
stellar disk. We found that not all the gas supplied from the host galaxy
accrete onto the SMBH even in the high accretion phase (mode (i)), because the
part of gas is used to form stars. As a result, the final SMBH mass ($M_{\rm
BH,final}$) is not proportional to the total gas mass supplied from the host
galaxy ($M_{\rm sup}$); $M_{\rm BH,final}/M_{\rm sup}$ decreases with $M_{\rm
sup}$.This would indicate that it is difficult to form a SMBH with $\sim 10^{9}
M_{\odot}$ observed at high-$z$ QSOs. The evolution of the SMBH and CND would
be related to the evolutionary tracks of different type of AGNs.

experiments including the WMAP 3-year results, large scale structure with
2dFGRS data sets, we constrain the hypothesis of massive neutrinos in the
mass-varying neutrino scenario. Assuming the flatness of the universe, the
constraint we can derive from the current observation is $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.45$
eV at 1$\sigma$ (0.87 eV at 2$\sigma$) confidence level for the sum over three
species of neutrinos. The dynamics of scalar field and the impact of scalar
field perturbations on cosmic microwave background anisotropies are discussed.
We also discuss on the instability issue of the our model and confirm that
neutrinos are stable against the density fluctuation.

their effect on the two perturbative fields $f_1$ and $\frac{d f_0}{d\theta}$.
A simple generic model of elliptical lens with a substructure situated near the
critical radius is investigated in details. Analytical expressions are derived
for each perturbative field, and basic properties are analyzed. The power
spectrum of the fields is well approximated by a power-law, resulting in
significant tails at high frequencies. Another feature of the perturbation by a
substructure is that the ratio of the power spectrum at order $n$ of the 2
fields $R_n$ is nearly 1. The ratio $R_n \simeq 1$ is specific to
substructures, for instance an higher order distortion ($n>2$) but with
auto-similar isophotes will result in $R_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}$. Finally, the
problem of reconstructing the perturbative field is investigated. Local field
model are implemented and fitted to maximize image similarity in the source
plane. The non-linear optimization is greatly facilitated, since in the
perturbative approach the circular source solution is always known. Examples of
images distortions in the subcritical regime due to substructures are
presented, and analyzed for different source shapes. Provided enough images and
signal is available, the substructure field can be identified confidently.
These results suggests that the perturbative method is an efficient tool to
estimate the contribution of substructures to the mass distribution of lenses.

mutual U(1) x U(1) Chern-Simons theory. However, we find that the different Z_2
topological orders are reflected in different projective realizations of
lattice symmetry in the same effective mutual Chern-Simons theory. This result
is obtained by comparing the ground-state degeneracy, the ground-state quantum
numbers, the gapless edge state, and the projective symmetry group of
quasi-particles calculated from the slave-particle theory and from the
effective mutual Chern-Simons theories. Our study reveals intricate relations
between topological order and symmetry.

option in an exponential regime-switching L\'{e}vy model. For the case of the
(dense) class of phase-type jumps and finitely many regimes we derive an
explicit expression for the value function. The solution of the corresponding
first passage problem under a state-dependent level rests on a path
transformation and a new matrix Wiener-Hopf factorization result for this class
of processes.
