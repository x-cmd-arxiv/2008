kinematic regimes with a heavier, but nearly degenerate, charged state
\chi^{+-}. For small splittings of O(10) MeV, the scattering of WIMPs off
nuclei may be dominated by inelastic recombination processes mediated by the
formation of (\chi^- N) bound states, leading to a distinct signature for
direct detection. These cross-sections are bound primarily by limits on the
abundance of heavy isotopes, and may be considerably larger than the elastic
scattering cross section in more conventional models. If the mass splitting is
too large for recombination to occur, there may still be a significant resonant
enhancement of loop-induced electromagnetic form-factors of the WIMP, which can
enhance the elastic scattering cross-section. We also discuss how this regime
affects the annihilation cross-section and indirect detection signatures, and
note the possibility of a significant mono-energetic \gamma-signal, mediated by
resonant processes near the (\chi^+\chi^-) bound state threshold.

vacuum states is possible by using quantum measurement information for the
vacuum state of quantum fields. In the protocol, Alice, who stays at a spatial
point, excites the ground state of the fields by a local measurement.
Consequently, wavepackects generated by A' measurement propagate the vacuum to
spatial infinity. Let us assume that Bob stays away from Alice and fails to
catch the excitation energy when the wavepackets pass in front of him. Next
Alice announces her local measurement result to Bob by classical communication.
Bob performs a local unitary operation depending on the measurement result. In
this process, positive energy is released from the fields to Bob's apparatus of
the unitary operation. In the field systems, wavepackets are generated with
negative energy around Bob's location. Soon afterwards, the negative -energy
wavepackets begin to chase after the positive-energy wavepackets generated by
Alice and form loosely bound states.

the specification logic and allows the development of proofs of properties
about specifications. An important characteristic of both logics is that they
exploit the lambda tree syntax approach to treating binding in object

establish the detailed characteristics of the thick disks obtained in this way,
as well as their dependence on the initial orbital and internal properties of
the accreted objects. We find that mergers with 10-20% mass of the mass of the
host lead to the formation of thick disks whose characteristics are similar,
both in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. Despite the relatively
large mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infalling
satellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing
~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and
thicker disk. This may for example, explain the existence of a very old thin
disk stars in the Milky Way. The final scale-heights of the disks depend both
on the initial inclination and properties of the merger, but the fraction of
satellite stellar particles at ~4 scale-heights directly measures the mass
ratio between the satellite and host galaxy. Our thick disks typically show
boxy isophotes at very low surface brightness levels (>6 magnitudes below their
peak value). Kinematically, the velocity ellipsoids of the simulated thick
disks are similar to that of the Galactic thick disk at the solar radius. The
trend of sigma_Z/sigma_R with radius is found to be a very good discriminant of
the initial inclination of the accreted satellite. In the Milky Way, the
possible existence of a vertical gradient in the rotational velocity of the
thick disk as well as the observed value of sigma_Z/sigma_R at the solar
vicinity appear to favour the formation of the thick disk by a merger with
either low or intermediate orbital inclination.

  Conservative Ones",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper we proposed a proposition: for any nonconservative classical
mechanical system and any initial condition, there exists a conservative one;
the two systems share one and only one common phase curve; the Hamiltonian of
the conservative system is the sum of the total energy of the nonconservative
system on the aforementioned phase curve and a constant depending on the
initial condition. Hence, this approach entails substituting an infinite number
of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system corresponding to
varied initial conditions. One key way we use to demonstrate these viewpoints
is that by the Newton-Laplace principle the nonconservative force can be
reasonably assumed to be equal to a function of a component of generalized
coordinates $q_i$ along a phase curve, such that a nonconservative mechanical
system can be reformulated as countless conservative systems. Utilizing the
proposition, one can apply the method of Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian
mechanics to dissipative mechanical system. The advantage of this approach is
that there is no need to change the definition of canonical momentum and the
motion is identical to that of the original system.

physics-based modeling. Computing these differential quantities consistently on
surface meshes is important and challenging, and some existing methods often
produce inconsistent results and require ad hoc fixes. In this paper, we show
that the computation of the gradient and Hessian of a height function provides
the foundation for consistently computing the differential quantities. We
derive simple, explicit formulas for the transformations between the first- and
second-order differential quantities (i.e., normal vector and principal
curvature tensor) of a smooth surface and the first- and second-order
derivatives (i.e., gradient and Hessian) of its corresponding height function.
We then investigate a general, flexible numerical framework to estimate the
derivatives of the height function based on local polynomial fittings
formulated as weighted least squares approximations. We also propose an
iterative fitting scheme to improve accuracy. This framework generalizes
polynomial fitting and addresses some of its accuracy and stability issues, as
demonstrated by our theoretical analysis as well as experimental results.

quasar lifetimes, Eddington ratios, and radiative efficiencies of supermassive
black holes. We derive such constraints using a statistically complete sample
of quasars with black hole mass estimates from broad Mg II, made both with and
without the radiation pressure correction of Marconi et al. (2008). We conclude
that for quasars with L/LEdd > 0.02, lifetimes can range from 140 to 750 Myr
for Schwarzschild black holes. Coupled with observed black hole masses, quasar
lifetimes of < 140 Myr would imply that radiatively inefficient accretion or BH
mergers must be important in the accretion history of quasars. Given reasonable
assumptions about the quasar population, if the average quasar lifetime is < 1
Gyr, and if radiatively inefficient accretion is unimportant, then not many BHs
with Eddington ratio < 0.2 can be rapidly spinning.

  The first class discussed, the class of Steiner polynomial, consists of
polynomials, each associated with a compact convex set V in R^n. A polynomial
of this class describes the volume of the set V+tB^n as a function of t, where
t is a positive number and B^n denotes the unit ball in R. The second class,
the class of Weyl polynomials, consists of polynomials, each associated with a
Riemannian manifold M, where M} is isometrically embedded with positive
codimension in R^n. A Weyl polynomial describes the volume of a tubular
neighborhood of its associated M as a function of the tube's radius. These
polynomials are calculated explicitly in a number of natural examples such as
balls, cubes, squeezed cylinders. Furthermore, we examine how the above
mentioned polynomials are related to one another and how they depend on the
standard embedding of R^n into R^m for m>n. We find that in some cases the real
part of any Steiner polynomial root will be negative. In certain other cases, a
Steiner polynomial will have only real negative roots. In all of this cases, it
can be shown that all of a Weyl polynomial's roots are simple and, furthermore,
that they lie on the imaginary axis. At the same time, in certain cases the

to study disordered systems, may provide a field theoretic description for the
loop-erased random walk (LERW), allowing to compute its fractal dimension in a
systematic expansion in epsilon=4-d. Up to two loop, the FRG agrees with
rigorous bounds, correctly reproduces the leading logarithmic corrections at
the upper critical dimension d=4, and compares well with numerical studies. We
obtain the universal subleading logarithmic correction in d=4, which can be
used as a further test of the conjecture.

metal nanoparticles with a weak probe in a strong pump field are investigated
theoretically. Excitons in such a hybrid molecule demonstrate novel optical
properties due to the coupling between exciton and plasmon. It is shown that a
non-absorption hole induced by coherent population oscillation appears at the
absorption spectrum of the probe field and there exists slow light effect
resulting in the great change of the refractive index. The numerical results
indicate that with the different center-to-center distance between the two
nanopaticles the slow light effects are greatly modified in terms of
exciton-plasmon couplings.

decompose quantum correlations into more elementary non-local correlations. We
show that the correlations of all pure entangled states of two qubits can be
simulated without communication, hence using only non-signaling resources. Our
simulation model works in two steps. First, we decompose the quantum
correlations into a local and a non-local part. Second, we present a model for
simulating the nonlocal part using only non-signaling resources. In our model
partially entangled states require more nonlocal resources than maximally
entangled states, but the less the state is entangled, the less frequently must
the nonlocal resources be used.
