masers towards 22 GHz water maser using the 100 m Efflesberg telescope. A total
of 89 sources were observed and 10 new methanol masers were detected. The new
detections are relatively faint with peak flux densities between 0.5 and 4.0
Jy. A nil detection rate from low-mass star forming regions enhances the
conclusion that the masers are only associated with massive star formation.
Even the faintest methanol maser in our survey, with a luminosity of 1.1
$10^{-9} L_\odot$ is associated with massive stars as inferred from its
infrared luminosity.

multiferroic behavior. Namely, if the substance has mixed-valence ions, which
can supply free carriers and have electric dipole and spin moments, all three
types of long-range order (ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric
(ME)) can occur at low temperature. The physical origin of the effect is that
charge carriers can mediate the multiferroic behavior via spin - spin (RKKY),
dipole-dipole and dipole - spin interactions. Our estimate of the interaction
magnitude shows that there exist an optimal carrier concentration, at which the
strength of ME interaction is maximal and comparable to that of spin-spin RKKY
interaction. This permits to conclude that in substances, where RKKY
interaction between local spins is not small, a substantial value of free
carriers mediated ME interaction can occur. Our analysis shows that disorder in
the above substances does not suppress multiferroic effects.

The range spanned by M* is 10^7 Msun < M* < 10^11 Msun, while the range spanned
by the dust-uncorrected UV SFR is 10^-2 Msun yr^-1 < SFR < 10 Msun yr^-1. There
is no evidence for intrinsic evolution in the distribution of M* with redshift.
We show that extinction by dust must be present in at least 25% of the GRB
hosts in our sample and suggest that this is a way to reconcile our finding of
a relatively lower UV-based, specific SFR (PHI = SFR/M*) with previous claims
that GRBs have some of the highest PHI values. We also examine the effect that
the inability to resolve the star-forming regions in the hosts has on PHI.

possible the construction of a general scheme for quantum physics, which 'looks

representing a formal language of a physical system, into an appropriate topos,
is analyzed here.

simplifying the basic ideas and do this work accessible to 'less experts' of
the field. A minor, but not less important, part of this paper is devoted to
resuming, in a concise way the background knowledge of logic, quantum logic and
category theory, that is necessary for anyone who wishes to follow the whole

Under conditions of migraine and stroke a breakdown of transmembrane chemical
gradients can spread through cortical tissue. A concomitant component of this
emergent spatio-temporal pattern is a depolarization of cells detected as slow
voltage variations. The velocity of ~3 mm/min indicates a contribution of
diffusion. We propose a mechanism for spreading depolarizations (SD) that rests
upon a nonlocal or non-instantaneous feedback in a reaction-diffusion system.
Depending upon the characteristic space and time scales of the feedback, the
propagation of cortical SD can be suppressed by shifting the bifurcation line,
which separates the parameter regime of pulse propagation from the regime where
a local disturbance dies out. The optimisation of this feedback is elaborated
for different control schemes and ranges of control parameters.

least two broad band filters. We aim at evaluate robustly the evolution of
rotating spirals since z~0.6, as well as to test the different schemes for
classifying galaxies morphologically. We used all the information provided by
multi-band images, color maps and 2 dimensional light fitting to assign to each
object a morphological class. We divided our sample between spiral disks,
peculiar objects, compact objects and mergers. Using our morphological
classification scheme, 4/5 of identified spirals are rotating disks and more
than 4/5 of identified peculiar galaxies show complex kinematics, while
automatic classification methods such as Concentration-Asymmetry and GINI-M20
severely overestimate the fraction of relaxed disk galaxies. Using this
methodology, we find that the fraction of rotating spirals has increased by a
factor ~ 2 during the last 6 Gyrs, a much higher fraction that found previously
based on morphologies alone. These rotating spiral disks are forming stars very
rapidly, doubling their stellar masses over the last 6 Gyrs, while most of
their stars have been formed few Gyrs earlier, which reveals the presence of a
large gas supply. Because they are likely the progenitors of local spirals, we
can conjecture how their properties are evolving. Their disks show some
evidence for an inside-out growth and the gas supply/accretion is not made
randomly as the disk need to be stable in order to match the local disk
properties.

turbulent state, the so-called topological instability of the
pressure-gradient-driven turbulence is observed. In this intermediate state, a
narrow spectral band of modes dominates the dynamics, giving rise to the
formation of iso-surfaces of electric potential with a complicated topology.
Since E x B advection of tracer particles takes place along these iso-surfaces,
their topological complexity affects the characteristic features of radial and
poloidal transport dramatically. In particular, they both become strongly
non-diffusive and non-Gaussian. Since radial transport determines the system
confinement properties and poloidal transport controls the equilibration
dynamics (on any magnetic surface), the development of non-diffusive models in
both directions is thus of physical interest. In previous work, a fractional
model to describe radial transport was constructed by the authors. In this
contribution, recent results on periodic fractional models are exploited for
the construction of an effective model of poloidal transport. Numerical
computations using a three-dimensional reduced magnetohydrodynamic set of
equations are compared with analytical solutions of the fractional periodic
model. It is shown that the aforementioned analytical solutions accurately
describe poloidal transport, which turns out to be superdiffusive with index
$\alpha=1$.

temperature dropped with time as T_e(t) ~ t^{-\alpha} with \alpha = 1.2 +/- 0.1

cooling of electrons in the cloud expanding linearly in time. The above-cited

effects from 3-body recombination' (i.e. the inelastic processes), but they did
not provide sufficient quantitative estimates supporting such a conclusion. The
aim of the present comment is to mention that the experimentally revealed

primarily a manifestation of ""virialization"" of the electron velocities in the
regime of strong electron-ion correlations, while the heat release by inelastic
processes should be of secondary importance (it might be responsible,
particularly, for changing the exponent from -1 to -1.2). This is confirmed
also by our ab initio molecular-dynamic simulations taking into account the

of an intuitive appeal, but VT estimation is biased and does not satisfy the
following fixed point property. Hypothetically, given an infinitely large
sample and initialized to the true parameters, VT will generally move away from
the initial values. We propose adjusted Viterbi training (VA), a new method to

baseline VT algorithm. Simulations elsewhere have shown that VA appreciably
improves the precision of estimation in both the special case of mixture models
and more general HMMs. However, being entirely analytic, the VA correction
relies on infinite Viterbi alignments and associated limiting probability
distributions. While explicit in the mixture case, the existence of these
limiting measures is not obvious for more general HMMs. This paper proves that
under certain mild conditions, the required limiting distributions for general

by Milgram, from a theoretical point of view. Simply if one has $k$ friends,
the number $N$ of indirect friends goes up to $\sim k^d$ in $d$ degrees of
separation. So it would easily come up to population of whole world. That,
however, is unacceptable. Mainly because of nonzero clustering coefficient $C$,
$N$ does not become $\sim k^d$. In this article, we first discuss relations
between six degrees of separation and the clustering coefficient in the small
world network proposed by Watt and Strogatz\cite{Watt1},\cite{Watt2}.
Especially, conditions that $(N)>$ (population of U.S.A or of the whole world)
arises in the WS model is explored by theoretical and numerical points of view.
Secondly we introduce an index that represents velocity of propagation to the
number of friends and obtain an analytical formula for it as a function of $C$,
$K$, which is an average degree over all nodes, and some parameter $P$
concerned with network topology. Finally the index is calculated numerically to
study the relation between $C$, $K$ and $P$ and $N$.

The rotation numbers are determined from the definition and connected with
symbolic sequences encoding the periodic orbits in a reduced Poincar\'e
section. Only symbolic codes with inverse ordering in the forward mapping can
contribute to the rotation of invariant manifolds around the periodic orbits.
By using symbolic ordering, the reduced Poincar\'e section is constricted along

established. The rotation numbers computed from the topological template are
the same as those computed from their original definition.

quite different distribution in space and velocity. The age of the stellar

following visual demonstrations. Haptic guidance by a force feedback device is
a recent and original technology which provides additional proprioceptive cues

guidances-control in position (HGP) or in force (HGF)-on visuo-manual tracking
(""following"") of trajectories are still under debate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS
FINDINGS: Three training techniques of haptic guidance (HGP, HGF or control
condition, NHG, without haptic guidance) were evaluated in two experiments.
Movements produced by adults were assessed in terms of shapes (dynamic time
warping) and kinematics criteria (number of velocity peaks and mean velocity)
before and after the training sessions. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These results
show that the addition of haptic information, probably encoded in force
coordinates, play a crucial role on the visuo-manual tracking of new
trajectories.

Inclusion of $t'$ without disorder leads to a metallic phase at half filling

correlation favours antiferromagnetic phase. Since disorder leads to double
occupancy over the lower energy site, the competition between Hubbard $U$ and
disorder leads to the emergence of a metallic phase, which can be quantified by
the calculation of Kubo conductivity, gap at half-filling, density of states,
spin order parameter, Inverse participation ratio (IPR) and bandwidth. We have
studied the effect of disorder on the system in a very novel way through a

duality with interference subtraction from Vishwanath et al., the proposed
duality is filter-based instead of covariance-based and exploits the arising
unitary degree of freedom to decorrelate every point-to-point link. Therefore,
it allows for noncooperative stream-wise decoding which reduces complexity and
latency. Moreover, the conversion from one domain to the other does not exhibit
any dependencies during its computation making it accessible to a parallel
implementation instead of a serial one. We additionally derive a rate duality
for systems with multi-antenna terminals when linear filtering without
interference (pre-)subtraction is applied and the different streams of a single
user are not treated as self-interference. Both dualities are based on a
framework already applied to a mean-square-error duality between the MAC and
the BC. Thanks to this novel rate duality, any rate-based optimization with
linear filtering in the BC can now be handled in the dual MAC where the arising
expressions lead to more efficient algorithmic solutions than in the BC due to
the alignment of the channel and precoder indices.

  collaborations welcomed",,,,"cs.DM cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article we investigate the topological changes undergone by
trajectory networks as a consequence of progressive geographical infiltration.
Trajectory networks, a type of knitted network, are obtained by establishing
paths between geographically distributed nodes while following an associated
vector field. For instance, the nodes could correspond to neurons along the
cortical surface and the vector field could correspond to the gradient of
neurotrophic factors, or the nodes could represent towns while the vector
fields would be given by economical and/or geographical gradients. Therefore
trajectory networks are natural models of a large number of geographical
structures. The geographical infiltrations correspond to the addition of new
local connections between nearby existing nodes. As such, these infiltrations
could be related to several real-world processes such as contaminations,
diseases, attacks, parasites, etc. The way in which progressive geographical
infiltrations affect trajectory networks is investigated in terms of the
degree, clustering coefficient, size of the largest component and the lengths
of the existing chains measured along the infiltrations. It is shown that the
maximum infiltration distance plays a critical role in the intensity of the
induced topological changes. For large enough values of this parameter, the
chains intrinsic to the trajectory networks undergo a collapse which is shown
not to be related to the percolation of the network also implied by the
infiltrations.

the tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies on an eccentric orbit in the Milky Way
(MW) potential. The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness
stellar disk embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10
Gyr of dynamical evolution and after 5 pericentre passages the dwarfs suffer
substantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major
morphological transformation from a disk to a bar and finally to a spheroid.
The bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is
transferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via
gradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive
quantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation
mechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We
compare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disk and find
that the evolution is fastest when the disk is coplanar with the orbit. Despite
the strong tidal perturbations and mass loss the dwarfs remain dark matter
dominated. For most of the time the 1D stellar velocity dispersion, \sigma,
follows the maximum circular velocity, V_{\rm max}, and they are both good
tracers of the bound mass. Specifically, we find that M_{\rm bound} \propto
V_{\rm max}^{3.5} and V_{\rm max} \sim \sqrt{3} \sigma in agreement with
earlier studies based on pure dark matter simulations. The latter relation is
based on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf and
may thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions of
dSphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellites
problem.

selected objects may be YSOs of classes I and II. In the color-magnitude
diagram K_s vs. H-K_s the suspected YSOs occupy an area right of the main
sequence what can be interpreted as being caused by the effects of luminosity,
interstellar and circumstellar reddening and infrared thermal emission in
circumstellar envelopes and disks.

solution to the black hole information paradox is commonly believed
phenomenologically unacceptable: since we have to expect a black hole remnant
for every possible initial state, the number of remnants should be infinite.
This would lead to remnant pair production in any physical process with a total
available energy roughly exceeding the Planck mass, against trivial evidences.
In this note I point out that the number of remnants in our Universe could be
finite, at least if the value of the cosmological constant is positive, as
present observational data could indicate. Nevertheless, it is not clear if a
huge but finite number of states is phenomenologically allowed.

  scheme for the drift-flux model",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present in this paper a pressure correction scheme for the drift-flux
model combining finite element and finite volume discretizations, which is
shown to enjoy essential stability features of the continuous problem: the
scheme is conservative, the unknowns are kept within their physical bounds and,
in the homogeneous case (i.e. when the drift velocity vanishes), the discrete
entropy of the system decreases; in addition, when using for the drift velocity
a closure law which takes the form of a Darcy-like relation, the drift term
becomes dissipative. Finally, the present algorithm preserves a constant
pressure and a constant velocity through moving interfaces between phases. To
ensure the stability as well as to obtain this latter property, a key
ingredient is to couple the mass balance and the transport equation for the
dispersed phase in an original pressure correction step. The existence of a
solution to each step of the algorithm is proven; in particular, the existence
of a solution to the pressure correction step is derived as a consequence of a
more general existence result for discrete problems associated to the
drift-flux model. Numerical tests show a near-first-order convergence rate for
the scheme, both in time and space, and confirm its stability.

the space of tuples of commuting trace-class self-adjoint operators, which
behaves like the usual trace map on the space of trace-class linear operators.
It turns out that such maps are related with continuous group homomorphisms
from the Milnor's $K$-group of the real numbers into the additive group of real
numbers. Using this connection, it is shown that any such trace map must be
trivial.

October 2006. We analysed the EPIC data of the detected point sources to derive
their spectral and temporal characteristics. We detected X-ray pulsations with
a period of 25.550(2) s from the second-brightest source in the field, which we
designate XMMU J004814.1-731003. The X-ray spectrum is well modelled by a
highly absorbed (NH = 5x10^22) powerlaw with photon index 1.33+/-0.27. The
precise X-ray position allows us to identify a Be star as the optical
counterpart. XMMU J004814.1-731003 is located within the error circle of the
transient ASCA source AX J0048.2-7309, but its position is inconsistent with
that of the proposed optical counterpart of AX J0048.2-7309 (the emission line
star [MA93] 215). It remains unclear if XMMU J004814.1-731003 is associated
with AX J0048.2-7309. XMMU J004814.1-731003 might be identical to an RXTE
pulsar that was discovered with a period of 25.5 s, but which is listed as 51 s
pulsar in the recent literature.
