method of identifying strong lens systems in large data sets. We study the
probabilities associated with these lens searches, namely the probability of
identifying a candidate with rogue [OII] emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum,
and the probability that the candidate will show features of strong lensing in
follow-up photometric observations. We include selection effects unique to
spectroscopic data, and apply them to the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey (Bolton
et al. 2006). The most significant selection effect is the finite size of the
spectroscopic fiber which selects against large separation lenses and results
in a non-monotonic dependence of the rogue line probability on velocity
dispersion. For example, with the 3 arcsec diameter SDSS fiber and 2 arcsec
FWHM seeing, we find that the probability that a given LRG has a rogue [OII]
line in its spectrum decreases with velocity dispersion from 150 km/s to 300
km/s and then increases up to 400 km/s for a given source size. The total
probability for observing a rogue line in a single survey spectrum is
~0.9-3.0%, and the total lensing rate is ~0.5-1.3%. The range is due to
uncertainties in the physical size of [OII] emission regions, and in the
evolution of the [OII] luminosity function. Our estimates are a factor of ~5
higher than the results of the SLACS survey, a discrepancy which we attribute
to the SLACS requirement that multiple rogue lines be observed simultaneously.

the transfer of property or responsibility from public sector to private
sector, is one of the global phenomenon that increases use of markets to
allocate resources. One important motivation for privatization is to help
develop factor and product markets, as well as security markets. Progress in
privatization is correlated with improvements in perceived political and
investment risk. Many emerging countries have gradually reduced their political
risks during the course of sustained privatization. In fact, most risk
resolution seems to take place as privatization proceeds to its later stage.
Alternative benefits of privatization are improved risk sharing and increased
liquidity and activity of the market. One of the main methods to develop
privatization is entering a new stock to the markets for arising competition.
However, attention to the capability of the markets to accept a new stock is
substantial. Without considering the above statement, it is possible to reduce
the market's efficiency. In other words, introduction of a new stock to the
market usually decreases the stage of development and activity and increases
the risk. Based on complexity theory, we quantify how the following factors:
stage of development, activity, risk and investment horizons play roles in the
privatization.

evolution of an energetic R-current propagating through a finite temperature,
strongly coupled, N=4 SYM plasma and propose a physical picture for our
results. In this picture, the current splits into a pair of massless partons,
which then evolve via successive branchings, in such a way that energy is
quasi-democratically divided among the products of a branching. We point out a
duality between the transverse size of the partonic system produced through
branching and the radial distance traveled by the dual Maxwell wave in the AdS
geometry. For a time-like current, the branching occurs already in the vacuum,
where it gives rise to a system of low-momentum partons isotropically
distributed in the transverse plane. But at finite temperature, the branching
mechanism is modified by the medium, in that the rate for parton splitting is
enhanced by the transfer of transverse momentum from the partons to the plasma.
This mechanism, which controls the parton energy loss, is sensitive to the
energy density in the plasma, but not to the details of the thermal state. We
compute the lifetime of the current for various kinematical regimes and provide
physical interpretations for other, related, quantities, so like the meson
screening length, the drag force, or the trailing string, that were previously
computed via AdS/CFT techniques.

star-forming E and S0 galaxies. These galaxies make up about 3% of the total
early-type sample and less than 1% of all Main galaxies with m(r)<16. We also
identified a sample of ~400 K+A galaxies from DR4 with m(r)<16; more than half
of these are E and S0 galaxies. We find that star-forming early-type galaxies
and K+A galaxies have similar mass distributions; they are on average less
massive than typical early-type galaxies but more massive than the average
star-forming galaxy. Both of these types of galaxies are found in higher
fractions among all galaxies in lower density environments. The fractions of
star-forming E and S0 galaxies and E and S0 K+A galaxies depend on environment
in nearly the same way. Model spectra fit to the stellar continua of the
star-forming E and S0 galaxies showed that their properties are consistent with
star formation episodes of <1 Gyr in duration. The modelling results imply that
on average, the star formation episodes will increase the stellar masses by

constrain the nature of Willman 1, we present a comprehensive analysis of the
brightest stars in a 0.6 square degree field centered on the overdensity.
High-resolution HET spectra of two previously identified Willman 1 RGB stars
show that one is a metal-rich foreground dwarf while the other is a metal-poor
giant. The one RGB star that we confirm as a member of Willman 1 has a low
metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.2) and a surprisingly low alpha-element abundance
([alpha/Fe]=-0.11). Washington+DDO51 photometry indicates that 2-5 of the seven
brightest Willman 1 stars identified in previous studies are actually dwarf
stars, including some of the more metal-rich stars that have been used to argue
both for an abundance spread and a more metal-rich stellar population than
galaxies of similar luminosity. The remaining stars are too blue or too faint
for photometric classification. The Washington+DDO51 photometry identifies
three potential RGB stars in the field but HET spectra show that they are
background halo stars. Time series photometry identifies one apparent variable
star in the field, but it is unlikely to be associated with Willman 1. Our
wide-field survey indicates that over 0.6 square degrees, Willman 1 does not
have a single RR Lyrae star, a single BHB star or a single RGB star beyond its
tidal radius. While our results confirm that Willman 1 is most likely a
low-luminosity metal-poor dSph galaxy, the possibility remains that it is a

advantage of computerized symbolic algebra over hand calculation is lost
through the fact that the symmetry is immediately ``thrown out'' by the

all cyclic p-roots of index 3 is treated with the symmetry preserved through
the calculations. Once we had found the relevant formulas, using MAPLE and
MATHEMATICA, the calculations could even be made by hand. On the other hand,
with respect to a straightforward attack with Groebner basis, it is not even
clear how this could be organized for a general p.
  In other terminologies, our results involve listings of all bi-unimodular

equivalently all circulant complex Hadamard matrices related to G_0.
  The corresponding problem for bi-unimodular sequences of index 2 was solved
by the first named author in 1989 and shortly after solved independently by de

their entire lengths, contradicting expectations based on model coronal
magnetic field strengths decreasing with height. Meanwhile Paul Bellan has
produced a theoretical model in which an initially empty, twisted force-free
loop, on being filled with plasma via upflow at each foot point, in the absence
of significant gravitational effects, forms a narrow, filamentary loop of
constant cross-section. In this paper, we focus on equilibrium states that
include stratification by uniform gravity while retaining the effects of
magnetic field twist. Comparing these with related force-free equilibria, it is
found that injection of low-$\beta $ plasma under coronal conditions is not
likely to change the shape of a loop significantly. These linear equilibria
apply to the interiors and boundaries of loops only, with external influences
modeled by boundary total pressures. The effects of total pressure balance with
surroundings and of gravitational stratification are to inhibit the pinching of
a loop to a constant cross-section. Only if the plasma $\beta$ were high enough
for the plasma to reconfigure the external field and the hydrostatic scale
height much greater than the loop size could the final state have nearly
constant cross section. We do not expect this to occur in the corona.

scaling. Such a scaling is also predicted by theoretical models and numerical
simulations of turbulence in a magnetized medium. For non-thermal line widths
narrower than \sim 0.7 km s^{-1}, this scaling breaks down, and we find that
the likely reason is ambiguities arising from Gaussian decomposition of
intrinsically narrow, blended lines. We use the above estimate of the
non-thermal contribution to the line width to determine corrected HI kinetic
temperature. The new limits that we obtain imply that a significantly smaller

compare the resulting evolutionary population synthesis model to the GALEX
far-near ultraviolet colors (FUV-NUV) of Virgo cluster early-type galaxies that

dividing luminosity of dwarf and giant galaxies, and becomes increasingly blue
for both brighter and fainter luminosities. This behavior can be easily
explained by the binary model with a continuous sequence of longer duration and
later truncation of star formation at lower galaxy masses. Thus, in contrast to
previous conclusions, the GALEX data do not require a dichotomy between the
stellar population properties of dwarfs and giants. Their apparently opposite
behavior in FUV-NUV occurs naturally when the formation of hot subdwarfs

uses the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the UT1 of the Very Large Telescope

quasars and several PSF stars. The spectra of the latter are used to remove the
point-like quasar from the data, and to unveil the faint underlying Lyman
alpha, envelopes associated with the quasars with unprecedented depth. We
clearly detect an envelope around two of the three quasars. These envelopes
measure respectively 10"" and 13"" in extent (i.e. 67 kpc and 87 kpc). This is 5
to 10 times larger than predicted by the models of Haiman & Rees (2001) and up
to 100 times fainter. Our observations better agree with models involing a
clumpy envelope as in Alam & Miralda-Escude (2002) or Chelouche et al. (2008).
We find that the brighter quasars also have the brighter envelopes but that the
extend of the envelopes does not depend on the quasar luminosity. Although our
results are based on only two objects with a detected Lyman alpha, envelope,
the quality of the spatial deblending of the spectra lends considerable hope to
estimate the luminosity function and surface brightness profiles of high
redshift Lyman alpha, envelopes down to F= 2-3 10^{-21} erg/s/cm^2/A. We find
that the best strategy to carry out such a project is to obtain both

corresponds to a baryon density of (3.4\pm1.3)x10^-5 (l/15Mpc)^-1/2 cm^-3,
where l is the length of the filament along the line of sight. This density
corresponds to a baryon over-density of approximately 150. The properties of
the gas in the filament are consistent with the results of simulations for the

energies, by assuming that the heliosheath proton distribution can be
approximated by a kappa-distribution. The choice of the kappa parameter derives
from observational data of the solar wind (SW). This has direct applications to
the upcoming IBEX mission. We will look at all-sky ENA maps within the IBEX
energy range (10 eV to 6 keV), as well as ENA energy spectra in several
directions. We find that the use of kappa, as opposed to a Maxwellian, gives
rise to greatly increased ENA fluxes above 1 keV, while medium energy fluxes
are somewhat reduced. We show how IBEX data can be used to estimate the
spectral slope in the heliosheath, and that the use of kappa reduces the
differences between ENA maps at different energies. We also investigate the
effect introducing a kappa-distribution has on the global interaction between
the SW and the local interstellar medium (LISM), and find that there is
generally an increase in energy transport from the heliosphere into the LISM,
due to the modified profile of ENA's energies. This results in a termination
shock that moves out by 4 AU, a heliopause that moves in by 9 AU and a bow
shock 25 AU farther out, in the nose direction.

with the infinite decoy protocol and also compare the cases using threshold

that with the AYKI protocol, one can achieve a key generation rate that is
close to the theoretical limit of infinite decoy protocol. Furthermore, our
simulation result shows that a photon-number resolving detector appears to be
not very useful for improving QKD performance in this case. Although our
analysis is focused on the QKD with PDC sources, we emphasize that it can also

renormalization"" scheme using the low-energy interaction and the general
principle of the scattering theory. We develop a method to distinguish
dynamically generated resonances from genuine quark states
[Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) poles] using the natural renormalization scheme
and phenomenological fitting. Analyzing physical meson-baryon scatterings, we
find that the Lambda(1405) resonance is largely dominated by the meson-baryon
molecule component. In contrast, the N(1535) resonance requires a sizable CDD
pole contribution, while the effect of the meson-baryon dynamics is also
important.

  welcomed!",,"10.1086/588187",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the relationship between the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$
and the Eddington ratio ($\xi=L_{X}(0.5-25 \rm keV)/L_{Edd}$) in six X-ray
binaries (XRBs) with well constrained black hole masses and distances. We find
that different XRBs follow different anti-correlations between $\Gamma$ and
$\xi$ when $\xi$ is less than a critical value, while $\Gamma$ and $\xi$
generally follow the same positive correlation when $\xi$ is larger than the
critical value. The anti-correlation and the positive correlation may suggest
that they are in different accretion modes (e.g., radiatively inefficient
accretion flow (RIAF) and standard disk). We fit both correlations with the
linear least-square method for individual sources, from which the crosspoint of
two fitted lines is obtained. Although the anti-correlation varies from source
to source, the crosspoints of all sources roughly converge to the same point
with small scatter($\log \xi=-2.1\pm0.2, \Gamma=1.5\pm 0.1$), which may
correspond to the transition point between RIAF and standard accretion disk.
Motivated by the observational evidence for the similarity of the X-ray
spectral evolution of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) to that of XRBs, we
then constrain the black hole masses for seven ULXs assuming that their X-ray
spectral evolution is similar to that of XRBs. We find that the BH masses of
these seven luminous ULXs are around $10^{4}\msun$, which are typical
intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our results are generally consistent with the BH
masses constrained from the timing properties (e.g., break frequency) or the
model fitting with a multi-color disk.

asymmetric rigid rotor, by projecting onto the state space of rigid body
rotations, the standard Ray Hamiltonian $H(1,\kappa,-1)$ (with asymmetry
parameter $1 \ge \kappa \ge -1$), becomes a quadratic polynomial in the
generators of the associated dynamical $su(1,1)$ algebra. We point out that
$H(1,\kappa,-1)$ is in fact quadratic in the Gaudin operators arising from the
quasiclassical limit of an associated $su_q(1,1)$ Yang-Baxter algebra. The

significant retention of acquired or horizontally (e.g. socially) transmitted

what evolves through culture is the mind; ideas and artifacts are merely

or by the increase in (information theory) entropy. None of the typical pure
mixing or separation processes are driving by free energy minimization and the
free energy (or total amount of chemical potential) has no change during the
processes of ideal mixture formation or ideal mixture separation. The
thermodynamic entropy change for the formation of ideal mixtures of gases,
liquids or solids is always zero.

field source density, and 15 times higher than the local group. Our X-ray
selected sources have luminosity values between 10E(39.6)<Lx<10E(41.4) ergs/s,
in which X-ray emission from LMXBs, hot halos and starburst galaxies becomes
noticeable. The significance of the source density excess vanishes gradually
for sources with Lx > 10E(40.5) ergs/s, at which point the source density
becomes comparable to that of the blank-field level. Considering this confined
low luminosity range and the X-ray to optical luminosity ratios (L_X/L_B), the
observed overdensity is ascribed to AGN fueling by its infall into cluster

Whereas, the quenching of AGN activity by the deep cluster potential explains
why the excess of the source density vanishes for the brighter sources.

arcsec. Our new images reveal complex, well resolved filamentary substructure
in the radio jets and tails. We also use these images to explore the spectral
structure of 3C 31 on large and small scales. We infer the apparent magnetic
field structure by correcting for Faraday rotation. Some of the intensity
substructure in the jets is clearly related to structure in their apparent
magnetic field: there are arcs of emission where the degree of linear
polarization increases, with the apparent magnetic field parallel to the ridges
of the arcs. The spectral indices are significantly steeper (0.62) within 7
arcsec of the nucleus than between 7 and 50 arcsec (0.52 - 0.57). The spectra
of the jet edges are also slightly flatter than the average for their
surroundings. At larger distances, the jets are clearly delimited from
surrounding larger-scale emission both by their flatter radio spectra and by
sharp brightness gradients. The spectral index of 0.62 in the first 7 arcsec of
3C 31's jets is very close to that found in other FR I galaxies where their
jets first brighten in the radio and where X-ray synchrotron emission is most
prominent. Farther from the nucleus, where the spectra flatten, X-ray emission
is fainter relative to the radio. The brightest X-ray emission from FR I jets
is therefore not associated with the flattest radio spectra, but with a
particle-acceleration process whose characteristic energy index is 2.24. The
spectral flattening with distance from the nucleus occurs where our
relativistic jet models require deceleration, and the flatter-spectra at the
jet edges may be associated with transverse velocity shear. (Slightly abridged)

observers have also reported the presence of material flows in such prominence
fine-structures. Here we investigate the time damping of non-leaky oscillations
supported by a homogeneous cylindrical prominence thread embedded in an
unbounded corona and with a steady mass flow. Thermal conduction and radiative
losses are taken into account as damping mechanisms, and the effect of these
non-ideal effects and the steady flow on the attenuation of oscillations is
assessed. We solve the general dispersion relation for linear, non-adiabatic
magnetoacoustic and thermal waves supported by the model, and find that slow
and thermal modes are efficiently attenuated by non-adiabatic mechanisms. On
the contrary, fast kink modes are much less affected and their damping times
are much larger than those observed. The presence of flow has no effect on the
damping of slow and thermal waves, whereas fast kink waves are more (less)
attenuated when they propagate parallel (anti-parallel) to the flow direction.
Although the presence of steady mass flows improves the efficiency of
non-adiabatic mechanisms on the attenuation of transverse, kink oscillations
for parallel propagation to the flow, its effect is still not enough to obtain
damping times compatible with observations.

have competing states (of crystalline order or not) which are locally close in
energy to the ground state (which is typically unique). Upon cooling, such
systems exhibit patches (or clusters) of these competing states which become
locally stable in the sense of having a relatively high local shear modulus. It
is in between these clusters where ageing, relaxation and plasticity under
strain can take place. We demonstrate explicitly that relaxation events that
lead to ageing occur where the local shear modulus is low (even negative), and
result in an increase in the size of local patches of relative order. We
examine the ageing events closely from two points of view. On the one hand we
show that they are very localized in real space, taking place outside the
patches of relative order, and from the other point of view we show that they
represent transitions from one local minimum in the potential surface to
another. This picture offers a direct relation between structure and dynamics,
ascribing the slowing down in glass forming systems to the reduction in
relative volume of the amorphous material which is liquid-like. While we agree
with the well known Adam-Gibbs proposition that the slowing down is due to an
entropic squeeze (a dramatic decrease in the number of available
configurations), we do not agree with the Adam-Gibbs (or the Volger-Fulcher)
formulae that predict an infinite relaxation time at a finite temperature.
Rather, we propose that generically there should be no singular crisis at any
finite temperature: the relaxation time and the associated correlation length
(average cluster size) increase at most super-exponentially when the
temperature is lowered.

several striking trends. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which reach ~3
magnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categories
based on their morphologies. `Stream-like' fields, so named for their
similarity to the CMD of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a red
clump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontal
branch. On the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps with
significant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and show
evidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 Gyr ago). We compare the
spatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recent
simulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellent
agreement. These fields, found across the face of M31, attest to the high
degree of pollution caused by this event. Disk-like material resides in the
extended disk structure of M31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); the
uniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of young
populations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistent
with a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating and
disruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giant
stream progenitor. Our comparative analysis sheds new light on the likely
composition of two of the ultra-deep pointings formerly presented as pure outer
disk and pure halo in the literature.

(MOND) and Newtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM). We extend our previous
simulations that involved pure stellar discs without gas, to deal with the
effects of gas dissipation and star formation. We also vary the interpolating
function between the MOND and Newtonian regime. Bar formation is compared in
both dynamics, from initial conditions identical in visible component. One
first result is that the MOND galaxy evolution is not affected by the choice of
the mu-function, it develops bars with the same frequency and strength. The
choice of the mu-function significantly changes the equivalent DM models, in
changing the dark matter to visible mass ratio and, therefore, changing the
stability. The introduction of gas shortens the timescale for bar formation in
the DM model, but is not significantly shortened in the MOND model. As a
consequence, with gas, the MOND and DM bar frequency histograms are now more
similar than without gas. The thickening of the plane occurs through vertical
resonance with the bar and peanut formation, and even more quickly with gas.
Since the mass gets more concentrated with gas, the radius of the peanut is
smaller, and the appearance of the pseudo-bulge is more boxy. The bar strength
difference is moderated by saturation, and feedback effects, like the bar
weakening or destruction by gas inflow due to gravity torques. Averaged over a
series of models representing the Hubble sequence, the MOND models have still
more bars, and stronger bars, than the equivalent DM models, better fitting the
observations. Gas inflows driven by bars produce accumulations at Lindblad
resonances, and MOND models can reproduce observed morphologies quite well, as
was found before in the Newtonian dynamics.

hadrons that we observe in the real world, there are many theories about how
many of them are needed and what quantum numbers they carry. Another important
question is what keeps them inside the hadron, which is known to have
space-time extension. Since they are relativistic objects, how would the hadron
appear to observers in different Lorentz frames? The hadron moving with speed
close to that of light appears as a collection of Feynman's partons. In other
words, the same object looks differently to observers in two different frames,
as Einstein's energy-momentum relation takes different forms for those
observers. In order to explain this, it is necessary to construct a quantum
bound-state picture valid in all Lorentz frames. It is noted that Paul A. M.
Dirac studied this problem of constructing relativistic quantum mechanics
beginning in 1927. It is noted further that he published major papers in this
field in 1945, 1949, 1953, and in 1963. By combining these works by Dirac, it
is possible to construct a Lorentz-covariant theory which can explain hadronic
phenomena in the static and high-speed limits, as well as in between. It is
shown also that this Lorentz-covariant bound-state picture can explain what we
observe in high-energy laboratories, including the parton distribution function

signal) contribution is calculated for generic WIMPs annihilating in the
galactic halo: we explicitly consider and quantify the various sources of
uncertainty in the theoretical evaluations. Propagation uncertainties, as is
the case of antiprotons, are sizeable. Nevertheless, antideuterons offer an
exciting target for indirect dark matter detection for low and intermediate
mass WIMP dark matter. We then show the reaching capabilities of the future
experiments for neutralino dark matter in a variety of supersymmetric models.

Doolittle (KD) concluded that the ""simplicity and graphic nature of

structures"". In practice, however, attempts to develop hydrophobicity scales
(for example, compatible with classical force fields (CFF) in calculating the
energetics of protein folding) have encountered many difficulties. Here we
suggest an entirely different approach, based on the idea that proteins are
self-organized networks, subject to finite-scale criticality (like some network
glasses). We test this proposal against two small proteins that are delicately
balanced between alpha and alpha/beta structures, with different functions
encoded with only 12% of their amino acids. This example explains why protein
structure prediction is so challenging, and it provides a severe test for the
accuracy and content of hydrophobicity scales. The new method confirms KD's
evaluation, and at the same time suggests that protein structure, dynamics and
function can be best discussed without using CFF.

function is more than invariant, it is trans-representational. It must occur

and Kraus. This collapse is widely believed to result in paradoxical causal
loops that cannot be removed by special relativistic or standard quantum
mechanical considerations alone. However, the paradox is resolved when we apply
the qRule foundation theory that is developed in the other paper. The causal
and temporal orders of state reduction are then found to be in agreement with
one another, and the resulting boundaries in Minkowski space are shown to have
a novel architecture that limits the range of a Hellwig-Kraus reduction in
space and time. Although these boundaries have been worked out using the
qRules, they should be the same for any foundation theory that treats the
collapse of a wave in an invariant way, and requires that a collapse destroys
the possibility of any further influence on itself, as do the qRules.

$Q(X)$ to obtain results for the cohomology of the symmetric group on $d$
letters, $\Sigma_d$, with `twisted' coefficients in various choices of Young
modules and to show that these computations reduce to certain natural questions
in representation theory. The authors extend classical methods for analyzing
the homology of certain spaces $Q(X)$ with mod-$p$ coefficients to describe the
homology $\HH_{\bullet}(\Sigma_d, V^{\otimes d})$ as a module for the general
linear group $GL(V)$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic
$p$. As a direct application, these results provide a method of reducing the
computation of $\text{Ext}^{\bullet}_{\Sigma_{d}}(Y^{\lambda},Y^{\mu})$ (where
$Y^{\lambda}$, $Y^{\mu}$ are Young modules) to a representation theoretic
problem involving the determination of tensor products and decomposition
numbers. In particular, in characteristic two, for many $d$, a complete
determination of $\Hs Y^\lambda)$ can be found. This is the first nontrivial
class of symmetric group modules where a complete description of the cohomology
in all degrees can be given. For arbitrary $d$ the authors determine
$\HH^i(\Sigma_d,Y^\lambda)$ for $i=0,1,2$. An interesting phenomenon is
uncovered--namely a stability result reminiscent of generic cohomology for
algebraic groups. For each $i$ the cohomology $\HH^i(\Sigma_{p^ad},
Y^{p^a\lambda})$ stabilizes as $a$ increases. The methods in this paper are
also powerful enough to determine, for any $p$ and $\lambda$, precisely when
$\HH^{\bullet}(\sd,Y^\lambda)=0$. Such modules with vanishing cohomology are of
great interest in representation theory because their support varieties

regions/molecular cloud complexes. Results: Ten molecular outflows were
identified out of the fifteen HII region/molecular cloud complexes. The higher
outflow detection rate (67%) suggested that such outflows are as common in high

consistent with the results of other authors. The observations also showed that
the outflow might occur in the HII region. The integrated CO line intensity

phase diagram of the coloring problem (with real Q and Q_s) is inferred, in the
limits of two-dimensional or quasi one-dimensional infinite graphs. We find in
particular that the special role played by Beraha numbers Q=4 cos^2(pi/n) for
the usual chromatic polynomial does not extend to the case Q different from
Q_s. The agreement with (scarce) existing numerical results is perfect; further
numerical checks are presented here.

microwave domain, where molecules are excited on a rotational transition and
energy is dissipated via strong interactions with a lossy stripline cavity, as
recently proposed by A. Andre et al., Nature Physics 2, 636 (2006). We identify
the dominant cooling and heating mechanisms in this setup and study cooling
rates and final temperatures in various parameter regimes. In particular we
analyze the effects of a finite environment temperature on the cooling
efficiency, and find minimal temperature and optimized cooling rate in the
strong drive regime. Further we discuss the trade-off between efficiency of
cavity cooling and robustness with respect to ubiquitous imperfections in a
realistic experimental setup, such as anharmonicity of the trapping potential.
