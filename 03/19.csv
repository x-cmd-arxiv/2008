their contributions to the space-time superpotential can be determined by a

by an A-infinity structure. We summarize the stringy instanton contribution to
the space-time superpotential in a simple formula.

lines with a two-component profile composed of a narrow contribution from cold
upstream hydrogen atoms, and a broad contribution from hydrogen atoms that have
undergone charge transfer reactions with hot protons. Observations of emission
lines from edge-wise shocks in SNRs can constrain the gas velocity and
collisionless electron heating at the shock front. Downstream hydrogen atoms
engage in charge transfer, excitation and ionization reactions, defining an
interaction region called the shock transition zone. The properties of hot
hydrogen atoms produced by charge transfers (called broad neutrals) are
critical for accurately calculating the structure and radiation from the shock
transition zone. This paper is the third in a series describing the kinetic,
fluid and emission properties of Balmer-dominated shocks, and is the first to
properly treat the effect of broad neutral kinetics on shock transition zone
structure. We use our models to extract shock parameters from observations of
Balmer-dominated SNRs. We find that inferred shock velocities and electron
temperatures are lower than those of previous calculations by <10% for v_s<1500
km/s, and by 10-30% for v_s>1500 km/s. This effect is primarily due to the fact
that excitation by proton collisions and charge transfer to excited levels
favor the high speed part of the neutral hydrogen velocity distribution. Our
results have a strong dependence on the ratio of electron to proton
temperatures, \beta=T_e/T_p, which allows us to construct a relation \beta(v_s)
between the temperature ratio and shock velocity. We compare our calculations
to previous results by Ghavamian et al. (2007).

case of perfect fluids at local thermodynamic equilibrium and evidence is found
that the bound is satisfied if and only if a certain local thermodynamic
property holds, emerging when the attempt is made to apply the bound to thin
layers of matter. This property consists in the existence of an ultimate lower
limit l* to the thickness of the slices for which a statistical-mechanical
description is viable, depending l* on the thermodynamical variables which
define the state of the system locally. This limiting scale, found to be in
general much larger than the Planck scale (so that no Planck scale physics must
be necessarily invoked to justify it), appears not related to gravity and this
suggests that the generalized entropy bound is likely to be rooted on
conventional flat-spacetime statistical mechanics, with the maximum admitted
entropy being however actually determined also by gravity.
  Some examples of ideal fluids are considered in order to identify the
mechanisms which can set a lower limit to the statistical-mechanical

The photon gas, in particular, appears to seemingly saturate this limiting
scale and the consequence is drawn that for systems consisting of a single
slice of a photon gas with thickness l*, the generalized Bousso bound is
saturated. It is argued that this seems to open the way to a peculiar
understanding of black hole entropy: if an entropy can meaningfully (i.e. with
a second law) be assigned to a black hole, the value A/4 for it (where A is the
area of the black hole) is required simply by (conventional) statistical
mechanics coupled to general relativity.

The corresponding charge moves in a force field and under an action of a random

model, an inner state of the charge is defined by a complex vector. The vector
rotates with a great constant angular velocity with respect to the proper time
of the charge. A state of the diffusion process is a (complex-valued) wave
function on the phase space. As in quantum mechanics, we assume that, for the
wave functions, the superposition principle holds. The diffusion process
averages out vectors of inner states from different points of the phase space.
A differential equation for this diffusion process is founded and examined. We
demonstrate that the motion (described by this process) decomposes into a fast
motion and a slow motion. The fast motion reduces an arbitrary wave function to
a function from a subspace whose elements are parameterized by complex-valued
functions of coordinates. The slow motion occurs in this subspace and it is
described by the Schr\''odinger equation. The parameters of the suggested model
are estimated. The duration of the fast motion is of order $10^{-11}$ s.

spreading into ligand-free regions without introducing any new, unknown kinetic

reaction mechanism, which consists of activation via dimerization and
deactivation via a Michaelis-Menten reaction. It possesses slow propagating
front solutions and faster initial transients. We analyze relevant experiments
and find that they are in quantitative accordance with the fast initial modes
of spreading, but not with the slow propagating front. We point out that
lateral spreading of activity is linked to pathological levels of persistent

""red wing"" of emission in its X-ray spectrum at energies 2 < E < 6.4 keV,
commonly interpreted as being caused by relativistically-blurred reflection
close to the event horizon of the black hole. We aim to test an alternative
model in which absorption creates the observed spectral shape, explains the
puzzling lack of variability of the red wing and reduces the high reflection
albedo, substantially greater than unity, that is otherwise inferred at
energies E > 20 keV. We compiled all the available long-exposure, high-quality
data for MCG-6-30-15: 522 ks of Chandra HETGS, 282 ks of XMM-Newton pn/RGS and
253 ks of Suzaku XIS/PIN data. This is the first analysis of this full dataset.
We investigated the spectral variability on timescales >20 ks using principal
components analysis and fitted spectral models to ""flux state"" and mean spectra
over the energy range 0.5-45 keV (depending on detector). The absorber model
was based on the zones previously identified in the high-resolution grating
data. Joint fits were carried out to any data that were simultaneous. Multiple
absorbing zones covering a wide range of ionisation are required by the grating
data, including a highly ionised outflowing zone. A variable partial-covering
zone plus absorbed low-ionisation reflection, distant from the source, provides
a complete description of the variable X-ray spectrum. A single model fits all
the data. We conclude that these zones are responsible for the red wing, its
apparent lack of variability, the absorption structure around the Fe K-alpha
line, the soft-band ""excess"" and the high flux seen in the hard X-ray band. A
relativistically-blurred Fe line is not required in this model. We suggest the
partial covering zone is a clumpy wind from the accretion disk.

religion, ethnic and cultural composition. The links between individuals - e.g.
by friendship, marriage or collaboration - are not evenly distributed, but
rather tend to be concentrated within the same group. This phenomenon, called
`imbreeding homophily', has been related to either (social) preference for
links with own-type individuals (`choice-based' homophily) or to the prevalence
of individuals of her same type in the choice set of an individual
(`opportunity-based' homophily). Choices determine the network of relations we
observe whereas opportunities pertain to the composition of the (unobservable)
social network individuals are embedded in and out of which their network of
relations is drawn. In this view, we propose a method that, in the presence of
multiple data, allows one to distinguish between opportunity and choice based
homophily. The main intuition is that, with unbiased opportunities, the effect
of choice-based homophily gets weaker and weaker as the size of the minority
shrinks, because individuals of the minority rarely meet and have the chance to
establish links together. The occurrence of homophily in the limit of very
small minorities is therefore an indicator of opportunity bias. We test this
idea across the dimensions of race and education on data on US marriages, and
across race on friendships in US schools.

at sufficiently great distance $\ell$ are receding faster than the speed of

because ``space itself is receding'' faster than $c$ at great distance, and it
is velocity relative to local space that is limited by $c$, not the velocity of
distant objects relative to nearby ones; (3) we can see galaxies receding
faster than the speed of light; and (4) the cosmological redshift is not a

early universe, the QCD transition occurs during which the quarks are combined
into the massive hadrons. This process reduces the effective relativistic
degree of freedom, and causes a change in the expansion behavior of the
universe. Similarly, the $e^+e^-$ annihilation occurred around $T\sim 0.5$ Mev
has the same kind of effect. Besides, the dark energy also drives the present
stage accelerating expansion. We study these combined effects on the relic
gravitational waves (RGWs). In our treatment, the QCD transition and the
$e^+e^-$ annihilation, each is respectively represented by a short period of
expansion inserted into the radiation era. Incorporating these effects, the
equation of RGWs is analytically solved for a spatially flat universe, evolving
from the inflation up to the current acceleration, and the spectrum of RGWs is
obtained, covering the whole range of frequency $>10^{-19}$ Hz. It is found
that the QCD transition causes a reduction of the amplitude of RGWs by $\sim
20%$ in the range $>10^{-9} $ Hz, and the $e^+e^-$ annihilation causes a
reduction $\sim 10%$ in the range $>10^{-12} $ Hz. In the presence of the dark
energy, the combination of the QCD transition and the $e^+e^-$ annihilation,
causes a larger reduction of the amplitude by $\sim 30% $ for the range

accreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc
qualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood,
but is less massive by a factor ~2-10. The dark matter disc contributes 0.25-1
times the halo density at the solar position. Although not likely to be
dynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the
direct detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the
Earth. Higher inclination encounters (>20 degrees) are twice as likely as low
inclination ones. These lead to structures that closely resemble the recently
discovered inner/outer stellar halos. They also do more damage to the Milky Way
stellar disc creating a more pronounced flare, and warp; both long-lived and
consistent with current observations. The most massive mergers (vmax>80km/s)
heat the thin disc enough to produce a thick disc. These heated thin disc stars

from its ability to perturb the existing motor distribution and to surf at the
resulting shock waves separating regions of different motor densities within
the transient regime. In this case, the observed bidirectionality of cargo
movement is naturally associated with reversals of shocks directions.
Comparison of the quantitative results predicted by this model with available
data for cargo velocity allows us to suggest that geometrical characteristics
of the transported particle shall determine the extension and intensity of the
perturbation it produces and thus, its dynamics. Possible implications of these
ideas to virus movement at the cell body are discussed in connection with their
distinguished morphological characteristics. Key words: collective effects of

emission from an irradiated accretion disk is sampled with a 2D Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code. We find that the distribution of DCO+ differs markedly
from that of HCO+. The D/H ratios inferred change by at least one order of
magnitude (0.01 to 0.1) for radii <30 AU to >70 AU and there is a rapid falloff
of the abundance of DCO+ at radii larger than 90 AU. Using a simple analytical
chemical model, we constrain the degree of ionization, x(e-)=n(e-)/n(H2), to be
~10^-7 in the disk layer(s) where these molecules are present. Provided the
distribution of DCN follows that of HCN, the ratio of DCN to HCN is determined

routing is the particular case $\ell=k=1$. In the $r$-central routing problem,

routing and the general $(\ell,k)$-routing problems on plane grids, that is
square grids, triangular grids and hexagonal grids. We use the

about packet routing, with special emphasis on $(\ell,k)$-routing on plane

  1. Tight permutation routing algorithms on full-duplex hexagonal grids, and
half duplex triangular and hexagonal grids.

lower bounds on the running time of any algorithm using shortest path routing.

independently at each node. Finally, we also formulate the $(\ell,k)$-routing

model than other dynamics DE models; the introduction of the matter-DE
interaction will make the YMC model deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM model, and
will give an equation of state (EOF) crossing -1. Moreover, it is also found
that, to fit the latest SNIa data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM model is slightly
better than the 3-loop YMC model; but in fitting of the combination of SNIa,
CMB and LSS data, the 3-loop YMC model performs better than the $\Lambda$CDM

one-dimensional electron system with an impurity. The system's inhomogeneity is
characterized by different values of Fermi wave vectors $k_F=k_{L/R}$ on
left/right side of the scatterer, leading to a Landauer dipole formation. We
demonstrate, that while in the noninteracting system the Friedel oscillations
possess only one periodicity related to the local $k_F$, say $k_L$ on the left

additional peak in the spectrum of density oscillations at the counterpart
$k_R$. Being only present in correlated systems, the position and shape of this
spectral feature, which in coordinate space is observable as a beating pattern
in the Friedel oscillations, reveals many important details about the nature of
interactions. Thus it has a potential to become an investigation tool in

larger than the effective damping of the second mechanical mode, the state

between the charged grains and the neutral fluid lead to narrower shock waves
and lower fractions of Si being released into the gas phase. More realistic
assumptions concerning the initial fractional abundance of O2 lead to SiO
formation being delayed, so that it occurs in the cool, dense postshock flow.
Good agreement is obtained with recent observations of SiO line intensities in
the L1157 and L1448 molecular outflows. The inferred temperature, opacity, and

requires a universal set of quantum logic gates for the implementation of
arbitrary quantum operations. As in classical models of computation, quantum
error correction techniques enable rectification of small imperfections in gate
operations, thus allowing for perfect computation in the presence of noise. For
fault-tolerant computation, it is commonly believed that error thresholds
ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-2 will be required depending on the noise model
and the computational overhead for realizing the quantum gates. Up to now, all
experimental implementations have fallen short of these requirements. Here, we
report on a Molmer-Sorensen type gate operation entangling ions with a fidelity
of 99.3(1)% which together with single-qubit operations forms a universal set
of quantum gates. The gate operation is performed on a pair of qubits encoded
in two trapped calcium ions using a single amplitude-modulated laser beam
interacting with both ions at the same time. A robust gate operation, mapping
separable states onto maximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically
switching the laser-ion coupling on and off. We analyse the performance of a
single gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations. The gate mechanism
holds great promise not only for two-qubit but also for multi-qubit operations.

fluctuations could be used to measure the scale of baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAOs) during the reionisation era. The resulting measurements are
potentially as precise as those offered by the next generation of galaxy
redshift surveys at lower redshift. However unlike galaxy redshift surveys,
which in the linear regime are subject to a scale independent galaxy bias, the
growth of ionised regions during reionisation is thought to introduce a
strongly scale dependent relationship between the 21cm and mass power spectra.
We use a semi-numerical model for reionisation to assess the impact of ionised
regions on the precision and accuracy with which the BAO scale could be
measured using redshifted 21cm observations. For a model in which reionisation
is completed at z~6, we find that the constraints on the BAO scale are not
systematically biased at z > 6.5. In this scenario, and assuming the
sensitivity attainable with a low-frequency array comprising 10 times the
collecting area of the Murchison Widefield Array, the BAO scale could be
measured to within 1.5 per cent in the range 6.5 < z < 7.5.

  Aware Link Weights Optimization","12 pages, Short version to be published in ACM SIGMETRICS 2008,
  International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems,
  June 2-6, 2008, Annapolis, Maryland, USA",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A well-known approach to intradomain traffic engineering consists in finding
the set of link weights that minimizes a network-wide objective function for a
given intradomain traffic matrix. This approach is inadequate because it
ignores a potential impact on interdomain routing. Indeed, the resulting set of
link weights may trigger BGP to change the BGP next hop for some destination
prefixes, to enforce hot-potato routing policies. In turn, this results in
changes in the intradomain traffic matrix that have not been anticipated by the
link weights optimizer, possibly leading to degraded network performance.
  We propose a BGP-aware link weights optimization method that takes these
effects into account, and even turns them into an advantage. This method uses
the interdomain traffic matrix and other available BGP data, to extend the
intradomain topology with external virtual nodes and links, on which all the
well-tuned heuristics of a classical link weights optimizer can be applied. A
key innovative asset of our method is its ability to also optimize the traffic
on the interdomain peering links. We show, using an operational network as a
case study, that our approach does so efficiently at almost no extra
computational cost.

to test for a presence of a third body. The O-C diagrams of these binaries were
analyzed with the least-squares method by using all available times of minima.
Also fourteen new minima, obtained from our observations, were included in the
present research. The light-time effect was adopted as a main factor for the
detailed description of the long-term period changes. Third bodies were found
with orbital periods from 46 up to 84 years, and eccentricities from 0.0 to
0.78 for the selected binaries. The mass functions and the minimal masses of
such bodies were also calculated.

immersed in a continuum solvent. As prototypical systems, we consider colloidal
dispersions of spherical particles and solutions of uncharged polymers. After a
brief explanation of the concept of hydrodynamic interactions, we give a
general overview over the various simulation methods that have been developed
to cope with the resulting computational problems. We then focus on the
approach we have developed, which couples a system of particles to a lattice
Boltzmann model representing the solvent degrees of freedom. The standard D3Q19
lattice Boltzmann model is derived and explained in depth, followed by a
detailed discussion of complementary methods for the coupling of solvent and
solute. Colloidal dispersions are best described in terms of extended particles
with appropriate boundary conditions at the surfaces, while particles with
internal degrees of freedom are easier to simulate as an arrangement of mass
points with frictional coupling to the solvent. In both cases, particular care
has been taken to simulate thermal fluctuations in a consistent way. The
usefulness of this methodology is illustrated by studies from our own research,
where the dynamics of colloidal and polymeric systems has been investigated in
both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.
