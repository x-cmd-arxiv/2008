  Networks","submitted to IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a two-hop wireless network where a transmitter communicates with
a receiver via $M$ relays with an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Recent
works have shown that sophisticated linear processing such as beamforming and
distributed space-time coding (DSTC) at relays enables to improve the AF
performance. However, the relative utility of these strategies depend on the
available channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), which in turn
depends on system parameters such as the speed of the underlying fading channel
and that of training and feedback procedures. Moreover, it is of practical
interest to have a single transmit scheme that handles different CSIT
scenarios. This motivates us to consider a unified approach based on DSTC that
potentially provides diversity gain with statistical CSIT and exploits some
additional side information if available. Under individual power constraints at
the relays, we optimize the amplifier power allocation such that pairwise error
probability conditioned on the available CSIT is minimized. Under perfect CSIT
we propose an on-off gradient algorithm that efficiently finds a set of relays
to switch on. Under partial and statistical CSIT, we propose a simple
waterfilling algorithm that yields a non-trivial solution between maximum power
allocation and a generalized STC that equalizes the averaged amplified noise
for all relays. Moreover, we derive closed-form solutions for M=2 and in
certain asymptotic regimes that enable an easy interpretation of the proposed
algorithms. It is found that an appropriate amplifier power allocation is
mandatory for DSTC to offer sufficient diversity and power gain in a general
network topology.

  International Symposium, San Diego : \'Etats-Unis d'Am\'erique (2006)",,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major issues with multiparticle reactors is to handle their
multiscale aspect. For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model
(describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain
model (simulating the behavior of a single grain or a particle). An interesting
approach proposed by H.Y. Sohn (1978) is to use the law of additive reaction
times in order to calculate, approximately but analytically, the reaction rate
of a particle in the reactor model. Its great advantage, compared to a
numerical grain model, is to drastically reduce the computation time,
particularly in the case of complex reactor models. This is the approach we
retained for modeling the moving bed furnace, a counter-current gas-solid
reactor used in the nuclear fuel-making route for producing uranium
tetrafluoride from uranium trioxide. The numerical model we developed is
2-dimensional, steady-state and based on the finite volume method. It describes
solid and gas flow, convective, conductive and radiative heat transfers, and
six chemical reactions involved in the process. The law of additive reaction
times is used to calculate analytically the rate of the three principal
gas-solid reactions at every discrete point in the reactor. We have
demonstrated the validity of this approach by comparing its results with those
calculated from a numerical grain model. Also detailed in the paper are the
main results of the moving bed furnace model itself and the possibilities of
optimizing the process revealed by the calculations.

describe the situation when the completely confined chain is released and
gradually leaves the tube. MC simulations were performed for a self-avoiding
lattice model with a biased chain growth algorithm, the pruned-enriched
Rosenbluth method. The nanotube is a long channel opened at one end and its
diameter $D$ is much smaller than the size of the polymer coil in solution. We
analyze the following characteristics as functions of the chain end position
$x$ inside the tube: the free energy of confinement, the average end-to-end
distance, the average number of imprisoned monomers, and the average stretching
of the confined part of the chain for various values of $D$ and for the number
of monomers in the chain, $N$. We show that when the chain end is dragged by a
certain critical distance $x^*$ into the tube, the polymer undergoes a
first-order phase transition whereby the remaining free tail is abruptly sucked
into the tube. This is accompanied by jumps in the average size, the number of
imprisoned segments, and in the average stretching parameter. The critical
distance scales as $x^*\sim ND^{1-1/\nu}$. The transition takes place when
approximately 3/4 of the chain units are dragged into the tube. The theory
presented is based on constructing the Landau free energy as a function of an
order parameter that provides a complete description of equilibrium and
metastable states. We argue that if the trapped chain is released with all
monomers allowed to fluctuate, the reverse process in which the chain leaves
the confinement occurs smoothly without any jumps. Finally, we apply the theory
to estimate the lifetime of confined DNA in metastable states in nanotubes.

the partonic/hadronic quark Molecular Dynamics (qMD) model, we investigate
numerous QGP signals constructed from the correlations and fluctuations of
conserved charges, namely charged particle ratio fluctuations, charge transfer
fluctuations as well as various ratios of susceptibilities. We argue that more
generally, the covariances and the variances of the conserved charges divided
by the number of charged particles are a measure of the quark number
susceptibilities and are thus sensitive to the phase of the system.
Computations carried within samples of central qMD events from low AGS energies
on ($E_{lab}=2$ AGeV) up to the highest RHIC energies available
($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV) show that the final state calculations are always
compatible with the hadronic result. From analyses performed as a function of
time with our sample of events at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, we find the
recombination-like hadronization process the qMD system undergoes to be
responsible for the vanishing of the early stage QGP correlations and
fluctuations. These results might explain the compatibility of the measurements
on charged particle ratio fluctuations with the hadronic expectations and leave

ring. In all, a few thousand dust impacts were counted with the instrument

sets of dust impacts were transmitted to Earth. Detected particle sizes range
from about 0.2 to 5 micron, extending the known size distribution by an order
of magnitude towards smaller particles than previously derived from optical
imaging (Showalter et al. 2008). The grain size distribution increases towards
smaller particles and shows an excess of these tiny motes in the Amalthea
gossamer ring compared to the Thebe ring. The size distribution for the
Amalthea ring derived from our in-situ measurements for the small grains agrees
very well with the one obtained from images for large grains. Our analysis
shows that particles contributing most to the optical cross-section are about 5
micron in radius, in agreement with imaging results. The measurements indicate
a large drop in particle flux immediately interior to Thebe's orbit and some

Haldane Insulator (HI) in analogy with the gapped phase of spin-1 chains, is
characterized by a non local order parameter, which can only be written as an
infinite string in terms of the bosonic densities. We show that the string
order can nevertheless be probed with physical fields that couple locally, via
the effect those fields have on the quantum phase transitions separating the
exotic phase from the conventional Mott and density wave phases. Using a field
theoretical analysis we show that a perturbation which breaks lattice inversion
symmetry gaps the critical point separating the Mott and Haldane phases and
eliminates the sharp distinction between them. This is remarkable given that
neither of these phases involves broken inversion symmetry. We also investigate
the evolution of the phase diagram with the tunable coupling between parallel
chains in an optical lattice setup. We find that inter-chain tunneling destroys
the direct phase transition between the Mott and Haldane insulators by
establishing an intermediate superfluid phase. On the other hand coupling the
chains only by weak repulsive interactions does not modify the structure of the
phase diagram. The theoretical predictions are confirmed with numerical
calculations using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG).

the life cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which belongs to a
large family of enveloped RNA viruses, retroviruses. Unlike regular enveloped
viruses, retrovirus budding happens {\em concurrently} with the self-assembly
of retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell
membrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free
energy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag
attraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag
attraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage
of budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\alpha$, increases
with time as $\alpha \propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is
weak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these
partially spherical capsids is given by
$\alpha_0\simeq(\tau^2/\kappa\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where
$\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the
membrane, and $\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the
strength of Gag-Gag attraction. Numerically, we find $\alpha_0<0.3\pi$ without
any approximations. Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and
assembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the
other hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it
is relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and
partial budding. Our model agrees reasonably well with experiments observing
partial budding of retroviruses including HIV.

measure of Granger causality between time series, based on kernel methods. The
generalization of kernel Granger causality to the multivariate case, here
presented, shares the following features with the bivariate measures: (i) the
nonlinearity of the regression model can be controlled by choosing the kernel
function and (ii) the problem of false-causalities, arising as the complexity
of the model increases, is addressed by a selection strategy of the
eigenvectors of a reduced Gram matrix whose range represents the additional
features due to the second time series. Moreover, there is no {\it a priori}
assumption that the network must be a directed acyclic graph. We apply the
proposed approach to a network of chaotic maps and to a simulated genetic
regulatory network: it is shown that the underlying topology of the network can
be reconstructed from time series of node's dynamics, provided that a
sufficient number of samples is available. Considering a linear dynamical
network, built by preferential attachment scheme, we show that for limited data
use of bivariate Granger causality is a better choice w.r.t methods using $L1$
minimization. Finally we consider real expression data from HeLa cells, 94
genes and 48 time points. The analysis of static correlations between genes
reveals two modules corresponding to well known transcription factors; Granger
analysis puts in evidence nineteen causal relationships, all involving genes
related to tumor development.

consider different values of the Ar, Kr, Xe, CH4, C2H6 and N2 abundances in the
gas phase that may be representative of Titan's early atmosphere. We discuss
the effect of the various parameters that are chosen to represent the
interactions between the guest species and the ice cage in our calculations. We
also discuss the results of varying the size of the clathrate cages. We show
that the trapping efficiency of clathrates is high enough to significantly
decrease the atmospheric concentrations of Xe and, to a lesser extent, of Kr,
irrespective of the initial gas phase composition, provided that these
clathrates are abundant enough on the surface of Titan. In contrast, we find
that Ar is poorly trapped in clathrates and, as a consequence, that the
atmospheric abundance of argon should remain almost constant. We conclude that
the mechanism of trapping noble gases via clathration can explain the
deficiency in primordial Xe and Kr observed in Titan's atmosphere by Huygens,
but that this mechanism is not sufficient to explain the deficiency in Ar.

periodicity as well as a dramatic variability over a time scale of few years.
Such a temporal behavior, coupled to the young age and to the lack of an
obvious optical counterpart, makes 1E 1613 a unique source among all compact
objects associated to SNRs. It could either be the first low-mass X-ray binary
system discovered inside a SNR, or a peculiar isolated magnetar with an
extremely slow spin period. Analysis of archival IR observations, performed in
2001 with the VLT/ISAAC instrument, and in 2002 with the NICMOS camera onboard
HST unveils a very crowded field. A few sources are positionally consistent
with the refined X-ray error region that we derived from the analysis of 13
Chandra observations. To shed light on the nature of 1E 1613, we have performed
deep IR observations of the field with the NACO instrument at the ESO/VLT,
searching for variability. We find no compelling reasons to associate any of
the candidates to 1E 1613. On one side, within the frame of the binary system
model for the X-ray source, it is very unlikely that one of the candidates be a
low-mass companion star to 1E 1613. On the other side, if the X-ray source is
an isolated magnetar surrounded by a fallback disc, we cannot exclude that the
IR counterpart be hidden among the candidates. If none of the potential
counterparts is linked to the X-ray source, 1E 1613 would remain undetected in
the IR down to Ks>22.1. Such an upper limit is consistent only with an
extremely low-mass star (an M6-M8 dwarf) at the position of 1E 1613, and makes
rather problematic the interpretation of 1E 1613 as an accreting binary system.

on nuclear activity. For this reason we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey
of a large homogeneous sample of galaxy pairs (UZC-BGP) and we present the
results of the nuclear spectral classification of 48 pairs (more than half of
the whole sample). The fraction of emission line galaxies is extremely large,
especially among spirals (84 % and 95 %, for early and late spirals
respectively). SB is the most frequent type of nuclear activity encountered (30
% of galaxies) while AGNs are only 19%. The fractions raise to 45 % and 22 %
when considering only spirals. Late spirals are characterized by both an
unusual increase (35 %) of AGN activity and high luminosity (44 % have M_B
<-20.0 + 5log h). LLAGNs are only 8% of the total number of galaxies, but this
activity could be present in another 10 % of the galaxies (LLAGN candidates).
Absorption line galaxies reside mostly (61 %) in S0 galaxies and display the
lowest B luminosity in the sample, only 18 % of them have M_B < -20 + 5 log h,
but together with LLAGNs they are the most massive galaxies in the sample.
Intense-SB nuclei are found in galaxy pairs with galaxy-galaxy projected
separations up to 160 h^{-1} kpc suggesting that in bright isolated galaxy
pairs interaction may be at work and effective up to that distance. AGNs are
characterized by an advanced morphology while SB phenomenon occurs with the
same frequency in early and late spirals. LLAGNs and LLAGN candidates do not
always show similar properties, a finding which might confirm the heterogeneous
nature of this class of objects. Half LLAGNs are hosted in galaxies showing
visible signs of interaction with fainter companions, suggesting that minor
interactions might be a driving mechanism for a relevant fraction of LLAGNs.

M_d=10^10 M_\sun, using cylindrically symmetric gas dynamical simulations run
with ZEUS-3D. The shocked swept-up shells quickly cool and fragment by
Rayleigh-Taylor instability as they accelerate out of the dense, stratified

fragmentation. We identify cooled shells and shell fragments as Na I absorbing
gas and study its kinematics. We find that simulations with a numerical
resolution of \le 0.2 pc produce multiple Rayleigh-Taylor fragmented shells in
a given line of sight. We suggest that the observed wide Na I absorption lines,
<v> = 320 \pm 120 km s^-1 are produced by these multiple fragmented shells

Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In this model the messenger
sector contains one pair of $3+\bar 3$ and one pair of $2+\bar 2$ messengers.
These two messenger pairs couple to different gauge singlets in the hidden
sector in which supersymmetry (SUSY) is broken. Such a gauge-mediation
structure can naturally arise in many backgrounds. Because of the two effective
SUSY breaking scales $\frac{< F_i>}{< M_i>}$ in the messenger sector, the
renormalization group evolutions of the soft SUSY breaking parameters can be
properly modified, leading to a negative enough singlet soft mass square
$m_N^2(\Lambda_{EW})$ and hence reasonable $\mu/B_\mu$ values. In most of the
perturbative (up to the GUT scale) parameter region, as a result, the
electroweak scale is stabilized and phenomenologically interesting mass spectra
of particles and superparticles are obtained. In addition, this model favors
large values of $\tan\beta$: $5 \sim 50$ and a heavy scalar spectrum. With the
relatively large $\tan\beta$, the light $U(1)_R$ pseudoscalar (mainly appearing
in the low-scale gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models) becomes extremely
singlet-like, and is no longer a problem in this model. These features apply to
all cases of low-, intermediate- and high-scale gauge-mediated SUSY breaking.

Often, there is no obvious
external cause, such as an interaction with a nearby galaxy, for such features.
Alternatively, the lopsidedness may have an internal cause, such as a dynamical
instability. In order to explore this idea, we have developed a computer code
that searches for self-consistent perturbations in razor-thin disc galaxies and
performed a thorough mode-analysis of a suite of dynamical models for disc
galaxies embedded in an inert dark-matter halo with varying amounts of rotation
and radial anisotropy. Models with two equal-mass counter-rotating discs and
fully rotating models both show growing lopsided modes. For the
counter-rotating models, this is the well-known counter-rotating instability,
becoming weaker as the net rotation increases. The m=1 mode of the maximally
rotating models, on the other hand, becomes stronger with increasing net
rotation. This rotating m=1 mode is reminiscent of the eccentricity instability
in near-Keplerian discs. To unravel the physical origin of these two different
m=1 instabilities, we studied the individual stellar orbits in the perturbed
potential and found that the presence of the perturbation gives rise to a very
rich orbital behaviour. In the linear regime, both instabilities are supported
by aligned loop orbits. In the non-linear regime, other orbit families exist
that can help support the modes. In terms of density waves, the
counter-rotating m=1 mode is due to a purely growing Jeans-type instability.
The rotating m=1 mode, on the other hand, grows as a result of the swing
amplifier working inside the resonance cavity that extends from the disc center
out to the radius where non-rotating waves are stabilized by the model's
outwardly rising Q-profile.

common proper motion, we deduce physical parameters of the objects by
spectroscopy, like temperature and mass. We find Cha Halpha 2 to be a very
close binary of ~0.16 arcsec separation, having a flux ratio of ~0.91, thus
having almost equal brightness and indistinguishable spectral types within the

proper motion pair, and that neither component is a non-moving background
object. We even find evidence for orbital motion. A combined spectrum of both
stars spanning optical and near-infrared parts of the spectral energy
distribution yields a temperature of 3000+/-100 K, corresponding to a spectral
type of M6+/-1 and a surface gravity of log g= 4.0 +0.75-0.5, both from a

random turbulent state evolves towards an intermittent state where forward
cascade of vorticity coexists with an inverse cascade of electric potential

coherent vortex solutions in the form of a dipolar-like configuration. The

W-annihilation. At the short-distance level, its branching ratio is very small,
of order $10^{-6}$, owing to chiral suppression. It receives long-distance
contributions through final-state scattering of the leading tree and
color-suppressed amplitudes. Assuming that the long-distance enhancement of

fluids properties dramatically. In this paper, we develop a dynamic effective
medium theory (EMT) for a system containing rotating particles of finite volume
fraction. This is a generalization of established EMT to account for the
interactions between many rotating particles. While the theory is valid for
three dimensions, the results in a special two dimensional configuration show
that the system exhibits an off-diagonal polarization response, in addition to
a diagonal polarization response, which resembles the classic Hall effect. The
diagonal response monotonically decreases with an increasing rotational speed,
whereas the off-diagonal response exhibits a maximum at a reduced rotational
angular velocity $\omega_0$ comparing to the case of isolated rotating
particles. This implies a way of measurement on the interacting relaxation
time. The dependencies of the diagonal and off-diagonal responses on various

rejection can be tolerated, procedures controlling error rates measuring at
least $k$ false rejections, instead of at least one, for some fixed $k\ge 1$
can potentially increase the ability of a procedure to detect false null
hypotheses. The $k$-FWER, a generalized version of the usual familywise error
rate (FWER), is such an error rate that has recently been introduced in the
literature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. A further
generalization of a result on the $k$-FWER is provided in this article. In
addition, an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the
$k$-FDR, is introduced in the same spirit as the $k$-FWER by generalizing the
usual false discovery rate (FDR). A $k$-FWER procedure is constructed given any
set of increasing constants by utilizing the $k$th order joint null
distributions of the $p$-values without assuming any specific form of
dependence among all the $p$-values. Procedures controlling the $k$-FDR are
also developed by using the $k$th order joint null distributions of the
$p$-values, first assuming that the sets of null and nonnull $p$-values are
mutually independent or they are jointly positively dependent in the sense of
being multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP$_2$) and then discarding
that assumption about the overall dependence among the $p$-values.

an indirect coding based on permutations of the nurses, and a heuristic decoder
that builds schedules from these permutations. Computational experiments based
on 52 weeks of live data are used to evaluate three different decoders with
varying levels of intelligence, and four well-known crossover operators.
Results are further enhanced by introducing a hybrid crossover operator and by
making use of simple bounds to reduce the size of the solution space. The
results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to find high quality
solutions and is both faster and more flexible than a recently published Tabu

choosing a suitable scheduling rule from a set for the assignment of each
nurse. Unlike previous work that used Genetic Algorithms (ga) to implement
implicit learning, the learning in the proposed algorithm is explicit, i.e. we
identify and mix building blocks directly. The eda is applied to implement such
explicit learning by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of
solutions. The conditional probability of each variable in the network is
computed according to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each
new instance for each variable is generated by using the corresponding
conditional probabilities, until all variables have been generated, i.e. in our
case, a new rule string has been obtained. Another set of rule strings will be
generated in this way, some of which will replace previous strings based on
fitness selection. If stopping conditions are not met, the conditional
probabilities for all nodes in the Bayesian network are updated again using the
current set of promising rule strings. Computational results from 52 real data
instances demonstrate the success of this approach. It is also suggested that
the learning mechanism in the proposed approach might be suitable for other
scheduling problems.

when differentiating among structures and pathologies in MRI images. A novel,
robust, fast and very simple method is presented for both estimating and
displaying the average time constant for the T2 decay of each pixel from a
multiecho MRI sequence. The average time constant is calculated from the
average of the values measured from the T2 decay over many echoes. For a
monoexponential decay, the normalized decay average varies monotonically with
the time constant. Therefore, it is simple to map any normalized decay average
to an average time constant. This method takes advantage of the robustness of
the normalized decay average to both artifacts and multiexponential decays.
Color intensity projections (CIPs) were used to display 32 echoes acquired at a
10ms spacing as a single color image. The brightness of each pixel in each
color image was determined by the intensity of the corresponding pixel in the
earliest image and the hue was determined by the normalized decay average.
Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of using CIPs to display the results of
a multiecho sequence for a healthy subject and a multiple sclerosis patient.

universal adaptive estimator which (i) matches performance of an oracle that
knows both an underlying model and an estimated conditional density; (ii) is
sharp minimax over a vast class of anisotropic conditional densities; (iii) is
at least rate minimax when the response is independent of the predictor and
thus a bivariate conditional density becomes a univariate density; (iv) is
adaptive to an underlying design (fixed or random) of predictors.

However, no rigorous approach has been developed to address two fundamental

We will show that the metric tensor of the perturbation manifold provides
important information about selecting an appropriate perturbation of a model.

objective functions at any point. Examples including linear regression models

  The different possibilities how MgS may be formed in the chemical environment

and by a detailed analysis of the growth kinetics of grains in stellar winds.
The optical properties of core-mantle grains with a MgS mantle are calculated
to demonstrate that such grains reproduce the structure of the observed 30

would imply that a brightening of 0.66+/-0.14 mag occurs between z~0.6 and z=0.
Any disagreement with the results of Flores et al. (2006) are attributed to
both an improvement of the local TFR and the more detailed accurate measurement
of the rotation velocities in the distant sample. Most of the uncertainty can
be explained by the relatively coarse spatial-resolution of the kinematical
data. Because most rotating disks at z~0.6 are unlikely to experience further
merging events, one may assume that their rotational velocity does not evolve
dramatically. If true, our result implies that rotating disks observed at z~0.6
are rapidly transforming their gas into stars, to be able to double their
stellar masses and be observed on the TFR at z=0. The rotating disks observed
are indeed emission-line galaxies that are either starbursts or LIRGs, which
implies that they are forming stars at a high rate. Thus, a significant
fraction of the rotating disks are forming the bulk of their stars within 6 to
8 Gyr, in good agreement with former studies of the evolution of the M-Z
relation.

astrometric corrected Chandra position of the ULX. Different scenarios have
been invoked as to explain the possible nature of CXOU J153434.9+151149. Based
on the observed X-ray morphology of the ULX, we determine that the inclination
angle to the elongated emission will be ~53 deg. Beaming with this geometry
from a stellar-mass black hole system will be inadequate to explain the
observed X-ray luminosity of this ULX. Finally, we suggest that mild-beaming
from a binary black hole with mass more than 50 solar masses, associated with a
young star cluster, is the most favorable scenario that describes the
multiwavelength properties of this ULX. Future observations are highly
essential to determine the nature of this rare object.

compared to normal stars. This so-called veiling is normally identified with an
excess continuous emission formed in shock-heated gas at the stellar surface
below the accretion streams. We have selected four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S
CrA NW and S CrA SE) with unusually strong veiling to make a detailed
investigation of veiling versus stellar brightness and emission line strengths
for comparisons to standard accretion models. We have monitored the stars
photometrically and spectroscopically at several epochs. In standard accretion
models a variable accretion rate will lead to a variable excess emission.
Consequently, the stellar brightness should vary accordingly. We find that the
veiling of absorption lines in these stars is strongly variable and usually so
large that it would require the release of several stellar luminosities of
potential energy. At states of very large line dilution, the correspondingly
large veiling factors derived correlate only weakly with brightness. Moreover,
the emission line strengths violate the expected trend of veiling versus line
strength. The veiling can change dramatically in one night, and is not
correlated with the phase of the rotation periods found for two stars. We show
that in at least three of the stars, when the veiling becomes high, the
photospheric lines become filled-in by line emission, which produces large
veiling factors unrelated to changes in any continuous emission from shocked
regions. We also consider to what extent extinction by dust and electron
scattering in the accretion stream may affect veiling measures in CTTS. We
conclude that the degree of veiling cannot be used as a measure of accretion
rates in CTTS with rich emission line spectra.

deconvolution methods are used to estimate the distribution of the covariates
under the null hypothesis, and a ``wild'' or moment-matching bootstrap argument
is employed to estimate the distribution of the experimental errors (distinct
from the distribution of the errors in covariates). Most of our attention is
directed at the case where the distribution of the errors in covariates is
known, although we also discuss methods for estimation and testing when the

distribution of experimental error, and, in particular, we depart substantially

increasing disorder strength the values of the longest delay times increase,
thereby, in turn, reducing the excitation gap.
