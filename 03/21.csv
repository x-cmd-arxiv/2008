tribimaximal lepton mixing, the observed quark mixing matrix, and the quark and
lepton masses, from discrete non-Abelian flavor symmetries. The SU(5) GUTs are
formulated on two five-dimensional throats in the flat limit and the neutrino
masses become small due to the type-I seesaw mechanism. The discrete
non-Abelian flavor symmetries are given by semi-direct products of cyclic
groups that are broken at the infrared branes at the tip of the throats. As a
result, we obtain SU(5) GUTs that provide a combined description of non-Abelian
flavor symmetries and quark-lepton complementarity.

some important observational facts explained by means of massive stars in
galaxies of different morphological type: the Milky Way, ellipticals and dwarf
spheroidals. I will describe first the time-delay model and its interpretation
in terms of abundance ratios in galaxies, then I will discuss the importance of
mass loss in massive stars to reproduce the data in the Galactic bulge and
disk. I will discuss also how massive stars can be important producers of
primary nitrogen if rotation in stellar models is taken into account.
Concerning elliptical galaxies, I will show that to reproduce the observed
[Mg/Fe] versus Mass relation in these galaxies it is necessary to assume a more
important role of massive stars in more massive galaxies and that this can be
achieved by means of downsizing in star formation. I will discuss how massive
stars are responsible in triggering galactic winds both in ellipticals and
dwarf spheroidals. These latter systems show a low overabundance of
alpha-elements relative to Fe with respect to Galactic stars of the same
[Fe/H]: this is interpreted as due to a slow star formation coupled with very
efficient galactic winds. Finally, I will show a comparison between the

Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and we follow the orbit of the clouds either
ballistically or by means of a hybrid model considering viscous interaction
between the clouds and the extra-planar gas.Given the self-similarity of the

differs from the throwing coordinate ~ 1 kpc at most. The range of heights and

shown to be gauge invariant. The method is then extended to the full

proven to be a genuine variational tool in any gauge. The role of ghosts is
discussed and the unitarity gauge is shown to be the only choice which allows
calculability without insertion of further approximations. The GEP for the
standard model is derived and its predictions are compared to the known
phenomenology, thus showing that the GEP provides an alternative
non-perturbative description of the known experimental data. By a consistent

the stellar excess has a cold kinematical signature as inferred from proper
motions, and was initially associated with debris from the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy (Sgr) -- namely the southern trailing tail. We have obtained radial
velocities using the Hydra multiobject spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5 m
telescope. Results for 183 proper-motion selected stars indicate that the
dominant population in this stellar excess is not debris from Sgr, but rather a
population that kinematically belongs to the ring-like stream that is now known
as the Monoceros stream. The orbit determined for this population agrees very
well with the predictions for the Monoceros stream from Penarrubia et al.
(2005). The radial-velocity dispersion of this population is between 20 and 30
km/s, lower than that of the Galactic field. Also, the shape of the
radial-velocity distribution shows a sharp cut-off on one side, which is more
in line with model predictions of the disruption of a satellite rather than
with the distribution of the Galactic field. Despite the fact that we now
believe most of the stars in the stellar excess to be part of Monoceros, about
ten stars in this stellar excess have highly negative radial velocities, which
is a clear indication of their membership to the Sgr trailing tidal tail.

lesser extent for sources in the Magellanic Clouds, compared to the Milky Way
-- while the narrow 13.7 micron C$_2$H$_2$ Q branch only shows the effect of
dust dilution at low mass-loss rates. A strong metallicity dependence is not
observed for the Q branch. Independent of metallicity, we also provide an
explanation for the observed shifts in the central wavelength of the SiC
emission feature, as we show that these are largely caused by molecular band
absorption on either side of the dust emission feature, dominating over shifts
in the central wavelength caused by self-absorption. We have devised a method
to study the dust condensation history in carbon-rich AGB stars in different
metallicity environments, by measuring the strength of the 11.3 \um SiC and 30

gauge theories, employing the AdS/CFT correspondence. Building on earlier work
by Mikhailov, we study the dispersion relation and energy loss of an
accelerating finite-mass quark in N=4 super-Yang-Mills, both in vacuum and in
the presence of a thermal plasma. In the former case, we notice that the
application of an external force modifies the dispersion relation. In the
latter case, we find in particular that when a static heavy quark is
accelerated by an external force, its rate of energy loss is initially
insensitive to the plasma, and there is a delay before this rate approaches the
value derived previously from the analysis of stationary or late-time
configurations.
  Following up on work by Herzog et al., we also consider the evolution of a
quark and antiquark as they separate from one another after formation, learning
how the AdS/CFT setup distinguishes between the singlet and adjoint
configurations, and locating the transition to the stage where the deceleration
of each particle is properly accounted for by a constant friction coefficient.
Additionally, we examine the way in which the energy of a quark-antiquark pair
moving jointly through the plasma scales with the quark mass. We find that the
velocity-dependence of the screening length is drastically modified in the
ultra-relativistic region, and is comparable with that of the transition
distance mentioned above.

Embedded Spitzer sources are identified for all but two of the 26 molecular

However, we find no correlation between alpha and flow length or opening angle,
and the outflows appear randomly orientated in each region. The more massive

crystals which is a concomitant with photoinduced nucleation. Since the
nucleation process in coherent regime is driven by the nonadiabatic transition
in each molecule followed by the propagation of phonons, it is necessary to
take into account the quantum nature of both electrons and phonons in order to
pursue the dynamics of the system. Therefore, we employ a model of localized
electrons coupled with a quantized phonon mode and solved the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation numerically. We found that there is a minimal size of
clusters of excited molecules which triggers the photoinduced nucleation
process, i.e., nucleation does not take place unless sufficient photoexcitation
energy is concentrated within a narrow area of the system. We show that this
result means that the spatial distribution of photoexcited molecules plays an
important role in the nonlinearity of the dynamics and also of the optical
properties observed in experiments. We calculated the conversion ratio, the
nucleation rate, and correlation functions to reveal the dynamical properties
of the pattern formation process, and the initial dynamics of the photoinduced
structural change is discussed from the viewpoint of pattern formation.

the optimum DMT. However, for the case of multiple access single relay setup,

simulations using a set of classical observables. It is quantified as the local
derivative of the logarithm of the dispersion of a given observable (within a
set of different simulations differing weakly through their initial
realization), with respect to the cosmic growth factor. In an Eulerian
framework, it is shown here that chaos appears at small scales, where dynamic
is non-linear, while it vanishes at larger scales, allowing the computation of
a critical transition scale corresponding to ~ 3.5 Mpc/h. This picture is
confirmed by Lagrangian measurements which show that the distribution of
substructures within clusters is partially sensitive to initial conditions,
with a critical mass upper bound scaling roughly like the perturbation's
amplitude to the power 0.15. The corresponding characteristic mass, $M_{\rm
crit}=2 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, is roughly of the order of the critical mass of non
linearities at z=1 and accounts for the decoupling induced by the dark energy
triggered acceleration. The sensitivity to detailed initial conditions spills
to some of the overall physical properties of the host halo (spin and velocity
dispersion tensor orientation) while other ""global"" properties are quite robust
and show no chaos (mass, spin parameter, connexity and center of mass
position). This apparent discrepancy may reflect the fact that quantities which
are integrals over particles rapidly average out details of difference in
orbits, while the other observables are more sensitive to the detailed
environment of forming halos and reflect the non-linear scale coupling
characterizing the environments of halos.

an asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole geometry. The method we follow uses
the WKB analytic expansion and point-splitting regularization, similarly to
previous calculations in the asymptotically flat case. Following standard
procedures, we write the Green function, regularize the initial divergent
expression by point-splitting, renormalize it by subtracting geometrical
counter-terms, and take the coincidence limit in the end. After explicitly
demonstrating the cancellation of the divergences and the regularity of the
Green function, we express the result as a sum of two parts. One is calculated
analytically and the result expressed in terms of some generalized
zeta-functions, which appear in the computation of functional determinants of
Laplacians on Riemann spheres. We also describe some systematic methods to
evaluate these functions numerically. Interestingly, the WKB approximation
naturally organizes $<\phi^2>$ as a series in such zeta-functions. We
demonstrate this explicitly up to next-to-leading order in the WKB expansion.
The other term represents the `remainder' of the WKB approximation and depends
on the difference between an exact (numerical) expression and its WKB
counterpart. This has to be dealt with by means of numerical approximation. The
general results are specialized to the case of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter
black hole geometries. The method is efficient enough to solve the
semi-classical Einstein's equations taking into account the back-reaction from
quantum fields on asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes.

(bosonization) analysis. The system displays a delocalized (superfluid) phase
at small values of the intensity of the secondary lattice V2 and a localized
(Bose glass-like) phase at larger intensity V2. We analyze the localization
transition as a function of the height V2 beyond the known limits of free and
hard-core bosons. We find that weak repulsive interactions unfavor the
localized phase i. e. they increase the critical value of V2 at which
localization occurs. In the case of integer filling of the primary lattice, the
phase diagram at fixed density displays, in addition to a transition from a
superfluid to a Bose glass phase, a transition to a Mott-insulating state for
not too large V2 and large repulsion. We also analyze the emergence of a
Bose-glass phase by looking at the evolution of the Mott-insulator lobes when
increasing V2. The Mott lobes shrink and disappear above a critical value of
V2. Finally, we characterize the superfluid phase by the momentum distribution,
and show that it displays a power-law decay at small momenta typical of
Luttinger liquids, with an exponent depending on the combined effect of the
interactions and of the secondary lattice. In addition, we observe two side
peaks which are due to the diffraction of the Bose gas by the second lattice.
This latter feature could be observed in current experiments as characteristics
of pseudo-random Bose systems.

number of questions about this fundamental standard, including such issues as
its composition, and in turn its mass and age. We report here a reanalysis of
Vega's composition. A full spectral synthesis based on the Roche model derived
earlier from NPOI interferometry is used. We find the line shapes in Vega's
spectrum to be more complex than just flat-bottomed, which have been previously
reported; profiles range from slightly self-reversed to simple ``V'' shapes. A
high SNR spectrum, obtained by stacking spectra from the ELODIE archive, shows
excellent agreement with the calculations, provided we add about 10 km/s of
macroturbulence to the predicted spectra. From the abundance analysis, we find
that Vega shows the peculiar abundance pattern of a \W Bootis star as
previously suggested. We investigate the effects of rotation on the deduced
abundances and show that the dominant ionization states are only slightly
affected compared to analyses using non-rotating models. We argue that the
rapid rotation requires the star be fully mixed. The composition leads to
masses and particularly ages that are quite different compared to what are
usually assumed.

large values simultaneously. We consider in detail the case when both $LH_u$
and $H_uH_d$ flat directions are operative with a non-renormalizable
superpotential. In case Hubble induced A-terms are present for these two flat
directions, their initial values are determined completely by the potential and
there are no ambiguities how they are mixed. Moreover, CP is violated even when
the Hubble parameter is large due to the Hubble induced A-term and cross
coupling in F-term, so that the lepton asymmetry is generated just after the
end of inflation. As a result, compared with the case of single flat direction,
the resultant lepton-to-entropy ratio is enhanced by a factor of
$H_{osc}/m_{3/2}$, where $H_{osc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the onset of
oscillation and $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass. However, when Hubble induced
A-terms do not exist, there remains indefiniteness of initial phases and CP is
violated spontaneously by the phase difference between initial phase and
potential minima of the hidden-sector induced A-terms. Therefore, CP-violation
is not effective until the onset of the oscillation of scalar fields around the
origin and there is suppression factor from thermal effect as is the case of
single flat direction. In this case, the amplitude of baryon isocurvature
perturbation imposes constraints on the model parameters.

depend on an additional variable, u, which encodes the dimensional shift.
Second, convert the u-dependent coefficients of (4-2epsilon)-dimensional master

polynomial dependence on u. Here, we give a proof of this property in the case

Each member appears as an inflexible, or as a non-contrarian or contrarian
floater. An inflexible sticks to its opinion, whereas a floater may change into
a floater of the alternative opinion. The occurrence of this change is governed
by the local majority rule: members meet in groups of a fixed size, and a
floater then changes its opinion provided it is a minority in the group.
Subsequently, a non-contrarian floater keeps the opinion as adopted under the
local majority rule, whereas a contrarian floater adopts the alternative
opinion. Whereas the effects of on the one hand inflexibles and on the other
hand non-contrarians and contrarians have previously been studied seperately,
the current approach allows us to gain insight in the effect of their combined
presence in a community. Given fixed proportions of inflexibles $(\alpha_{A},
\alpha_{B})$ for the two opinions, and fixed fractions of contrarians
$(\gamma_{A}, \gamma_{B})$ among the $A$ and $B$ floaters, we derive the update
equation $p_{t+1}$ for the overall support for opinion $A$ at time $t+1$, given
$p_{t}$. The update equation is derived respectively for local group sizes 1, 2
and 3. The associated dynamics generated by repeated local updates is then
determined to identify its asymptotic steady configuration. The full opinion
flow diagram is thus obtained, showing conditions in terms of the parameters
for each opinion to eventually win the competing dynamics. Various dynamical
scenarios are thus exhibited, and it is derived that relatively small densities
of inflexibles allow for more variation in the qualitative outcome of the
dynamics than higher densities of inflexibles.

correlation functions and is linked to individual excitations resulting in
configuration transitions, which are very sensitive to the local symmetries.
This is followed by two other transitions, corresponding to orthoradial and
radial diffusion, for which both individual and collective excitations play a
significant role. Finally, we show that, contrary to large systems, the focus

driven 3D active region responds to the driver with the formation of Thin

coronal mass ejections. It has been documented that active regions form self
similar structures with area Probability Distribution Functions (PDF's)

energy release on the other hand follows a specific energy distribution law
$f(E_T)\sim E_T^{-a}$, where $a \sim 1.6-1.8$ and $E_T$ is the total energy
released. A possible explanation for the statistical properties of the

$S_{11}(1650)$, $D_{13}(1520)$, and $D_{13}(1700)$ resonances, in addition to
the mesonic current. Consideration of other well-established resonances in the

$F_{15}(1680)$, does not further improve the results qualitatively. For the

heterogeneous data integration, across sequence, expression and interactome
level attributes. Using the example of the \textit{Gata2} gene and its recently
discovered urogenital enhancers \cite{Khandekar2004} as a case study, we
examine the predictive value of various high throughput functional genomic
assays in characterizing these enhancers and their regulatory role. Observing
results from the application of modern statistical learning methodologies for
each of these data modalities, we propose a set of attributes that are most
discriminatory in the localization and behavior of these enhancers.

  distance measurements","5 pages, 4 figures, accepted as Research Note in A&A, final version

appear to be the densest galaxy structures in the Universe. Redshift
information is insufficient to determine whether a CG is roughly as dense in 3D
as it appears in projection, or whether it is caused by a chance alignment (CA)
along the line of sight within a larger galaxy system. Recent precise distance
measurements help probe the nature of the nearest CG, situated in the Virgo
cluster, whose dominant member is M60. The isolated status of the CG is
reassessed with recent photometry and a statistical analysis is performed on
the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances measured by Mei et al. in
Virgo, for 4 of the 5 CG members. The neighboring galaxy NGC 4606 appears (with
80-90% confidence) to be too faint to affect the isolated status of the CG.
Taken at face value, the SBF distances suggest that M59 and NGC 4660 lie
roughly 2 Mpc to the foreground of M60, NGC 4638, and the bulk of the Virgo
cluster. The statistical analysis confirms that the CG is, indeed, the result
of a CA of its galaxies, with NGC 4638 lying at least 800 kpc further away
(with 99% confidence) than either M59 or NGC 4660. The first two galaxy
distances are consistent with M59 and NGC 4660 constituting a tight pair. The
dominant galaxy, M60, is at least 440 kpc more distant (95% confidence) than
the M59+NGC 4660 pair, and over 1 Mpc (99% confidence) more distant if one uses
the broken linear calibration of the SBF distances. This work constitutes the
first direct analysis of the nature of a compact group of galaxies. CAs of
galaxies represent a realistic alternative to truly dense groups to explain the
nature of CGs. With current SBF distance accuracies, one could determine the
nature of HCG 68 in the same way.

cm-1 on a self-doped LaxMnO3-d (x~~0.8) film. From these measurements we
determined the conductivity, the effective number of free carriers, and the
specific phonon modes as a function of frequency. While the metal-insulator
transition temperature (TMI) and the magnetic ordering temperature (TC)
approximately coincide, the free carrier density onset occurs at a
significantly lower temperature (~~45 K below). This suggests that local
distortions exist below TMI and TC which trap the eg conduction electrons.
These regions with local distortions constitute an insulating phase which
persists for temperatures significantly below TMI and TC. The initial large
drop in resistivity is due to the enhanced magnetic ordering while further
drops correspond to reductions in the insulating phase which increase the
number of free carriers.

has been reported to deviate from its theoretical value in solar and stellar
X-ray spectra. This is attributed to opacity in the 15.01 A line, leading to a
reduction in its intensity, and was interpreted in terms of a geometry in which
the emitters and absorbers are spatially distinct. Aims. We study the I(15.01
A)/I(16.78 A) intensity ratio for the active cool dwarf EV Lac, in both flare
and quiescent spectra. Methods. The observations were obtained with the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer on the XMM-Newton satellite. The emission
measure distribution versus temperature reconstruction technique is used for
our analysis. Results. We find that the 15.01 A line exhibits a significant
enhancement in intensity over the optically thin value. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that such an enhancement has been detected on such a sound
statistical basis. We interpret this enhancement in terms of a geometry in
which the emitters and absorbers are not spatially distinct, and where the
geometry is such that resonant pumping of the upper level has a greater effect
on the observed line intensity than resonant absorption in the line-of-sight.

gauge twist and spatial symmetries of the many body system. It imposes a non
trivial gap closing condition under the gauge twist in both finite- and
infinite-size systems. It also implies a necessary condition for the gapped and
unique ground state. As for the simplest case, it predicts an inevitable gap
closing in the Heisenberg chain of half integer spins. Its relation to the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is discussed based on the symmetries of the twisted
Hamiltonian. The discussion is also extended to the (approximately) degenerated
multiplet and fermion cases. It restricts the number of the states in the low
energy cluster of the spectrum by the filling of the fermions. Constraints by
the reflection symmetry are also discussed.

the form of the energy of unstable states: This energy should be much smaller
