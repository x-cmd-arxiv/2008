communication cost of simulating a bipartite unitary gate, and to determine

surprising properties: 1) simulating it with the assistance of unlimited EPR
pairs requires far more communication than with a better choice of entangled

create entanglement. This suggests that 1) unlimited EPR pairs are not the most
general model of entanglement assistance for two-party communication tasks, and
2) the entangling and communicating abilities of a unitary interaction can vary
nearly independently. The technical contribution behind these results is a

gravitation, an attempt beyond the standard theories, including general
relativity of Einstein. A particular emphasis will be placed on the issue of an
accelerating universe, a rather recent development since nearly 10 years ago,
suggesting a strong motivation toward attempts beyond the conventional concepts
of the traditional cosmology. We face today's version of the cosmological
constant problem. A candidate of the new ingredient appears to be provided by a
scalar field, sometimes under the names like quintessence or dark-energy. In
this article, we discuss the subject from a point of view of a more theoretical
approach based on the scalar-tensor theory of gravitation. By exploiting the
concepts of conformal transformations and conformal frames unique to this type
of approach, we show that a successful understanding of the observed
cosmological acceleration entails an unexpected outcome of breakdown of WEP,
which may show up as a distinct behavior between hydrogen and antihydrogen in
the gravitational influence, from a further wider perspective including a
vector field as well. We intended to introduce most of the new concepts as
plainly and briefly as possible, according to the nature of the talk. On the

variations. Cosmological star formation appears to have both a higher M_c and a
slightly shallower slope at intermediate to high stellar mass. The center of
the Milky Way may have a shallow slope too. Field regions have slightly steeper
slopes than clusters, but this could be the result of enhanced drift of low
mass stars out of clusters and associations. Dwarf galaxies also have steeper
slopes. Results from the observation of pre-stellar clumps are reviewed too.
Pre-stellar clumps appear to have about the same mass function as stars and are

the IMF is generally determined by gas-phase processes. Brown dwarf formation
also shares many characteristics of star formation, suggesting that they form

are largest at times of order of the inverse of the Debye cutoff frequency,
$\omega_D$, and we find that within that time scale they are often spatially
very long ranged. We discuss the behavior of the characteristic penetration
lengths that describe these triplet correlations. We also find that the
ferromagnets can locally magnetize the superconductor near the interface, and
that the local magnetization then undergoes strongly damped oscillations. The
local density of states exhibits a variety of energy signatures, which we

is employed by some discount air carriers. The model is based on the principles
of statistical mechanics where each seat in the aircraft has an associated
energy which reflects the preferences of the population of air travelers. As
each passenger enters the airplane they select their seats using Boltzmann
statistics, proceed to that location, load their luggage, sit down, and the
partition function seen by remaining passengers is modified to reflect this
fact. I discuss the various model parameters and make qualitative comparisons
of this passenger boarding model with models which involve assigned seats. This
model can also be used to predict the probability that certain seats will be
occupied at different times during the boarding process. These results may be
of value to industry professionals as a useful description of this boarding
method. However, it also has significant value as a pedagogical tool since it
is a relatively unusual application of undergraduate level physics and it
describes a situation with which many students and faculty may be familiar.

quark pulled through the plasma.) We use a toy model in which nonconformality
is introduced via a one-parameter deformation of the AdS black hole dual to the

that seen in lattice calculations of QCD at temperatures a few times that of
the crossover to quark-gluon plasma, we find that the jet quenching parameter

affected by at most 20%, but the drag and diffusion coefficients for a slowly

properties of the medium at infrared energy scales proportional to T, namely
the scales where the quark-gluon plasma of QCD can be strongly coupled. The

Cosmic Microwave Background photons by hot (> 10^6 K) cluster gas (the SZ
effect) over thousands of square degrees. A large observational follow-up
effort to obtain redshifts for these SZ-detected clusters is under way. Given
the large area covered by these surveys, most of the redshifts will be obtained
via the photometric redshift (photo-z) technique. Here we demonstrate, in an
application using ~3000 SDSS stripe 82 galaxies with r<20, how the addition of
GALEX photometry (FUV, NUV) greatly improves the photometric redshifts of
galaxies obtained with optical griz or ugriz photometry. In the case where
large spectroscopic training sets are available, empirical neural-network-based
techniques (e.g., ANNz) can yield a photo-z scatter of $\sigma_z = 0.018
(1+z)$. If large spectroscopic training sets are not available, the addition of
GALEX data makes possible the use simple maximum likelihood techniques, without
resorting to Bayesian priors, and obtains $\sigma_z=0.04(1+z)$, accuracy that
approaches the accuracy obtained using spectroscopic training of neural
networks on ugriz observations. This improvement is especially notable for blue
galaxies. To achieve these results, we have developed a new set of high
resolution spectral templates based on physical information about the star
formation history of galaxies. We envision these templates to be useful for the
next generation of photo-z applications. We make our spectral templates and new
photo-z catalogs available to the community at

Unmatter with such equations of state would have a significant impact on the
expansion history of the universe. Using type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements and the shift parameter of the cosmic

the $\Lambda$UDM model, in which unmatter is the sole dark matter, we find that
$d_U > 60$ at 95% C.L. For comparison, in most unparticle physics models it is
assumed $d_U<2$. For the $\Lambda$CUDM model, in which unmatter co-exists with

databases. For this method, support, the co-occurrence frequency of the items
which form an association, is used as the primary indicator of the
associations's significance. A single user-specified support threshold is used
to decided if associations should be further investigated. Support has some
known problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces
misleading associations.
  In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an
alternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint
utilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a
simple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction
data's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified
precision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency
thresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the
notion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all
NB-frequent itemsets in a database. In experiments with publicly available
transaction databases we show that the new constraint provides improvements
over a single minimum support threshold and that the precision threshold is
more robust and easier to set and interpret by the user.

preparation time of the physical system represented by the state. This special
time is investigated in the context of scattering theory, where, in standard
quantum mechanics, the physical meaning of a preparation time has remained
obscure. In an experiment, the preparation time corresponds to an ensemble of
times of scattering marking the times in the laboratory when one scattering
projectile interacts with one target quantum.

of mean motion resonances between the planets. This theory relies on the
averaging of a perturbation to the two-body problem over the mean longitudes.
We expand the perturbing Hamiltonian in Taylor series with respect to the
ratios of semi-major axes which are considered as small parameters, without
direct restrictions on the eccentricities. Next, we average out the resulting
series term by term. This is possible thanks to a particular but in fact quite
elementary choice of the integration variables. It makes it possible to avoid
Fourier expansions of the perturbing Hamiltonian. We derive high order
expansions of the averaged secular Hamiltonian (here, up to the order of 24)
with respect to the semi-major axes ratio. The resulting secular theory is a
generalization of the octupole theory. The analytical results are compared with
the results of numerical (i.e., practically exact) averaging. We estimate the
convergence radius of the derived expansions, and we propose a further
improvement of the algorithm. As a particular application of the method, we
consider the secular dynamics of three-planet coplanar system. We focus on
stationary solutions in the HD 37124 planetary system.

of a quantum system is proposed. The set comprises the spectrum-generating
algebra of the Hamiltonian. The idea is to consider a certain open-system
evolution, which can be interpreted as a process of weak measurement of the
distinguished observables performed on the evolving system of interest. Given
that the observables are ""classical"" and the Hamiltonian is moderately
nonlinear, the open system dynamics displays a large time-scales separation
between the dephasing of the observables and the decoherence of the evolving
state in the basis of the generalized coherent states (GCS), associated with
the spectrum-generating algebra. The time scale separation allows the unitary
dynamics of the observables to be efficiently simulated by the open-system
dynamics on the intermediate time-scale.The simulation employs unraveling of
the corresponding master equations into pure state evolutions, governed by the
stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger equantion (sNLSE). It is proved that GCS are
globally stable solutions of the sNLSE, if the Hamilonian is linear in the
algebra elements.

microwave billiards, one with mushroom-like shape and the other from the
familiy of the Limacon billiards, is presented. These billiards have mixed
regular-chaotic dynamics but different structures in their classical phase
spaces. The spectrum of each billiard is represented as a time series where the
level order plays the role of time. Two most important findings follow from the
time-series analysis. First, the spectra can be characterized by two distinct
relaxation lengths. This is a prerequisite for the validity of the
superstatistical approach which is based on the folding of two distribution
functions. Second, the shape of the resulting probability density function of
the so-called superstatistical parameter is reasonably approximated by an
inverse chi-square distribution. This distribution is used to compute
nearest-neighbor spacing distributions and compare them with those of the
resonance frequencies of billiards with mixed dynamics within the framework of
superstatistics. The obtained spacing distribution is found to present a good
description of the experimental ones and is of the same or even better quality
as a number of other spacing distributions, including the one from Berry and
Robnik. However, in contrast to other approaches towards a theoretical
description of spectral properties of systems with mixed dynamics,
superstatistics also provides a description of properties of the
eigenfunctions. Indeed, the inverse chi-square parameter distribution is found
suitable for the analysis of experimental resonance strengths in the Limacon
billiards within the framework of superstatistics.

finite range, can be efficiently enumerated by sorting the values of $f$ and
$g$ in ascending order and searching for collisions. This article considers
functions that are bimonotone in the sense that $f(a,b) \le f(a',b')$ whenever
$a \le a'$ and $b \le b'$. A two-variable polynomial with non-negative
coefficients is a typical example. The problem is to efficiently enumerate all
pairs $(a,b)$ such that the values $f(a,b)$ appear in increasing order. We
present an algorithm that is memory-efficient and highly parallelizable. In
order to enumerate the first $n$ values of $f$, the algorithm only builds up a
priority queue of length at most $\sqrt{2n}+1$. In terms of bit-complexity this
ensures that the algorithm takes time $O(n \log^2 n)$ and requires memory
$O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$, which considerably improves on the memory bound $\Theta(n
\log n)$ provided by a naive approach, and extends the semimonotone enumeration
algorithm previously considered by R.L. Ekl and D.J. Bernstein.
