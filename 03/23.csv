of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars is usually interpreted as an indicator of
grain growth. We show in this paper that a similar behaviour of the feature
shape occurs when the porosity of composite grains varies. The fluffy
aggregates, having inclusions of different sizes, were modeled by multi-layered
spheres consisting of amorphous carbon, amorphous silicate and vacuum. It is
also found that the inclusion of crystalline silicates in composite porous
particles can lead to a shift of the known resonances and production of new

  A reference frame in event space is a smooth field of orthonormal bases.
Every reference frame is equipped by anholonomic coordinates. Using anholonomic
coordinates allows to find out relative speed of two observers and appropriate
Lorentz transformation. Synchronization of a reference frame is an anholonomic
time coordinate. Simple calculations show how synchronization influences time
measurement in the vicinity of the Earth. Measurement of Doppler shift from the
star orbiting the black hole helps to determine mass of the black hole.
  We call a manifold with torsion and nonmetricity the metric\hyph affine
manifold. The nonmetricity leads to a difference between the auto parallel line
and the extreme line, and to a change in the expression of the Frenet transport
and moving basis. The torsion leads to a change in the Killing equation. We
also need to add a similar equation for the connection.
  The analysis of the Frenet transport leads to the concept of the Cartan
transport and an introduction of the connection compatible with the metric
tensor. The dynamics of a particle follows to the Cartan transport. We need
additional physical constraints to make a nonmetricity observable. Learning how
torsion influences on tidal force reveals similarity between tidal equation for
geodesic and the Killing equation of second type.

in the zeroth order of e/Q, while its time-average is valid in the first order.
So the formula cannot be used for analysis in higher orders of e/Q. This
necessitates corrections in the theory of tidal despinning and libration
damping.
  We prove that when the inclination is low and phase lags are linear in
frequency, the Kaula series is equivalent to a corrected version of the
MacDonald method. The correction to MacDonald's approach would be to set the
phase lag of the integral bulge proportional to the instantaneous frequency.
The equivalence of descriptions gets violated by a nonlinear
frequency-dependence of the lag.
  We explain that both the MacDonald- and Darwin-torque-based derivations of
the popular formula for the tidal despinning rate are limited to low
inclinations and to the phase lags being linear in frequency. The
Darwin-torque-based derivation, though, is general enough to accommodate both a
finite inclination and the actual rheology.
  Although rheologies with Q scaling as the frequency to a positive power make
the torque diverge at a zero frequency, this reveals not the impossible nature
of the rheology, but a flaw in mathematics, i.e., a common misassumption that
damping merely provides lags to the terms of the Fourier series for the tidal
potential. A hydrodynamical treatment (Darwin 1879) had demonstrated that the
magnitudes of the terms, too, get changed. Reinstating of this detail tames the
infinities and rehabilitates the ""impossible"" scaling law (which happens to be
the actual law the terrestrial planets obey at low frequencies).

quantum field theories with instantons in a novel way by using the ""infinite
radius limit"" (rather than the limit of free field theory) as the starting
point. The theory dramatically simplifies in this limit, because the
correlation functions of all, not only topological (or BPS), observables may be
computed explicitly in terms of integrals over finite-dimensional moduli spaces
of instanton configurations. In Part I (arXiv:hep-th/0610149) we discussed in
detail the one-dimensional (that is, quantum mechanical) models of this type.
Here we analyze the supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models and
four-dimensional Yang--Mills theory, using the one-dimensional models as a
prototype. We go beyond the topological (or BPS) sectors of these models and
consider them as full-fledged quantum field theories. We study in detail the
space of states and find that the Hamiltonian is not diagonalizable, but has
Jordan blocks. This leads to the appearance of logarithms in the correlation
functions. We find that our theories are in fact logarithmic conformal field
theories (theories of this type are of interest in condensed matter physics).
We define jet-evaluation observables and consider in detail their correlation
functions. They are given by integrals over the moduli spaces of holomorphic
maps, which generalize the Gromov--Witten invariants. These integrals generally

Minor corrections and changed title",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Suppose that a real valued process X is given as a solution to a stochastic
differential equation. Then, for any twice continuously differentiable function
f, the backward Kolmogorov equation gives a condition for f(t,X) to be a local
martingale.
  We generalize the backward equation in two main ways. First, it is extended
to non-differentiable functions. Second, the process X is not required to
satisfy an SDE. Instead, it is only required to be a quasimartingale satisfying
an integrability condition, and the martingale condition for f(t,X) is then
expressed in terms of the marginal distributions, drift measure and jumps of X.
The proof involves the stochastic calculus of Dirichlet processes and a
time-reversal argument.
  These results are then applied to show that a continuous and strong Markov
martingale is uniquely determined by its marginal distributions.

definition of the Ponzano-Regge model in this paper is determined by its
reformulation in terms of group variables. The regularisation is defined and a
proof is given that the partition function is well-defined only when a certain
cohomological criterion is satisfied. In that case, the partition function may
be expressed in terms of a topological invariant, the Reidemeister torsion.
This proves the independence of our definition on the triangulation of the
3-manifold and on those arbitrary choices made in the regularisation. A further
corollary is that when the observable is a knot, the partition function (when
it exists) can be written in terms of the Alexander polynomial of the knot.
Various examples of observables in the three-sphere are computed explicitly.
Alternative regularisations of the Ponzano-Regge model by the simple cutoff

$T_c = \mu (8/\pi e^{\gamma -2} + o(1)) e^{\pi/(2\sqrt \mu a)}$ in the low
density limit $\mu\to 0$. The formula holds for a suitable class of interaction
potentials with negative scattering length $a$ in the absence of bound states.

LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$, we have constructed a minimal model, where inclusion of

is applied to the model to investigate the origin of superconductivity. We
conclude that the multiple spin fluctuation modes arising from the nesting
across the disconnected Fermi surfaces realize an extended s-wave pairing,
while d-wave pairing can also be another candidate.

Besides its two well-known forms, four more forms of de Sitter space-time are
also established with ten independent Killing vector fields for which four
different time evolution regimes can explicitly be specified by the symmetry
requirement. A family of space-times in which metric characterizing functions
are of the general form and admitting six or seven independent Killing vector
fields is presented.

A key feature is the inclusion of the I=S=0 two-pion intermediate state
('sigma(600)') as a significant component of the inter-nucleon potential
energy. In this approach, deuteron binding is seen to be predominantly a
consequence of sigma(600) and omega(783) exchange, with a secondary tole played
by rho(770). We explore sensitivity of two-nucleon binding to changes in the
potential and thereby obtain an anthropic constraint -- that the deuteron
unbinds for a modest decrease (about 6%) in the attractive sigma(600)
potential.

with common covariance and having $m$ and $n$ degrees of freedom, respectively.
The distribution of the largest eigenvalue of $(A+B)^{-1}B$ has numerous
applications in multivariate statistics, but is difficult to calculate exactly.
Suppose that $m$ and $n$ grow in proportion to $p$. We show that after
centering and scaling, the distribution is approximated to second-order,
$O(p^{-2/3})$, by the Tracy--Widom law. The results are obtained for both
complex and then real-valued data by using methods of random matrix theory to
study the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobi unitary and orthogonal ensembles.
Asymptotic approximations of Jacobi polynomials near the largest zero play a
central role.
