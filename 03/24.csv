in a pair of charge qubits based on the single Cooper-pair box. We measure
even- and odd-state dwell time distributions as a function of temperature, and
interpret these results using a kinetic theory. While the even-state lifetime
is exponentially distributed, the odd-state distribution is more heavily
weighted to short times, implying that odd-to-even tunnel events are not
described by a homogenous Poisson process. The mean odd-state dwell time
increases sharply at low temperature, which is consistent with quasiparticles
tunneling out of the island before reaching thermal equilibrium.

fluid, where the highly viscous normal component is practically always in a

momentum or spin. These characteristics do not change when the particles
interact with other particles or fields as long as they preserve their
entities. Quantum theory does not explain this quantization. It is introduced
into the theory a priori. An interacting particle is an open system and thus
does not obey conservation laws. However, an open system may create dynamically
stable states with unchanged dynamical variables via self-organization. In
self-organized systems stability is achieved through the interplay of
nonlinearity and dissipation. Can self-organization be responsible for particle
formation? In this paper we develop and analyze a particle model based on
qualitative dynamics and the Feigenbaum universality. This model demonstrates
that elementary particles can be described as self-organized dynamical systems
belonging to a wide class of systems characterized by a hierarchy of
period-doubling bifurcations. This semi-qualitative heuristic model gives
possible explanations for charge and action quantization, and the origination
and interrelation between the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, as well
as SU(2) symmetry. It also provides a basis for particle taxonomy endorsed by
the Standard Model. The key result is the discovery that the Planck constant is
intimately related to elementary charge.

existence of minimizers for inequalities and of critical points of functionals

Banach space, generalizing the Hilbert space case elaborated in \cite{ccbook}.
The key object is a dislocation space - a triple $(X,F,D)$, where $F$ is a
convex functional that defines a norm on Banach space $X$, and $D$ is a group
of isometries on $X$. Bounded sequences in dislocation spaces admit a
decomposition into an asymptotic sum ""profiles"" $w^{(n)}\in X$ dislocated by
actions of $D$, that is, a sum of the form $\sum_ng^{(n)}_kw^{(n)}$,
$g^{(n)}_k\in D$, while the remainder term converges weakly under actions of
any sequence $g_k\in D$ ({\em $D$-weak convergence}). This decomposition allows
to extend the weak convergence argument from variational problems with
compactness to problems where $X$ is {\em cocompactly} (relatively to the group
$D$) imbedded into a Banach space $Y$, that is, when every sequence $D$-weakly
convergent in $X$ is convergent in the norm of $Y$. We prove a general
statement on existence of minimizers in cocompact imbeddings that applies, in
particular to Sobolev imbeddings which lack compactness (unbounded domain,
critical exponent) including the subelliptic Sobolev spaces and spaces over

studied by means of a nonlinear classical model consisting of several
noninteracting nucleons (particles) moving in a potential well with an
oscillating nuclear surface (wall). The motion of the nuclear surface is
described by means of a collective variable which appears explicitly in the
Hamiltonian as an additional degree of freedom. The total energy of the system
is therefore conserved. Although the particles do not directly interact with
each other, their motions are indirectly coupled by means of their interaction
with the moving nuclear surface. We consider as free parameters in this model
the degree of collectivity and the fraction of nucleons that participate to the
decay of the collective excitation. Specifically, we have calculated the decay
width of the ISGMR in the spherical nuclei $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, $^{144}\rm{Sm}$,
$^{116}\rm{Sn}$ and $^{90}\rm{Zr}$. Despite its simplicity and its purely
classical nature, the model reproduces the trend of the experimental data which
show that with increasing mass number the decay width decreases. Moreover the
experimental results (with the exception of $^{90}\rm{Zr}$) can be well fitted
using appropriate values for the free parameters mentioned above. It is also
found that these values allow for a good description of the experimentally
measured $^{112}\rm{Sn}$ and $^{124}\rm{Sn}$ decay widths. In addition, we give
a prediction for the decay width of the exotic isotope $^{132}Sn$ for which
there is experimental interest. The agreement of our results with the
corresponding experimental data for medium-heavy nuclei is dictated by the
underlying classical mechanics i.e. the behaviour of the maximum Lyapunov
exponent as a function of the system size.

terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and size of
measurement errors and stellar jitter. We show that all planets with orbital
periods <2000 days, velocity amplitudes >20 m/s, and eccentricities <0.6 have

orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the
velocity amplitude of a companion, typically 10 m/s, and use the non-detections
to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods.
We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of planet mass and
orbital period, and extrapolate to long period orbits and low planet masses. A
power law fit for planet masses >0.3 Jupiter masses and periods <2000 days
gives a mass-period distribution dN=C M^\alpha P^\beta dlnM dlnP with
\alpha=-0.31 \pm 0.2, \beta=0.26\pm 0.1, and the normalization constant C such
that 10.5% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10
Jupiter masses and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution
shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of 5 for orbital periods
beyond 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17-20% of stars having gas giant planets

YSO in a low-density distributed population. The ratio of clustered to total

G192.54-0.15, located inside HII region S254 has a VLSR of 17 km/s with respect

one of the most distant giant molecular clouds known in the extreme outer
Galaxy (EOG). At the probable Galactic radius of ~20 kpc, Cloud 2 has a quite
different environment from that in the solar neighborhood, including lower
metallicity, much lower gas density, and small or no perturbation from spiral
arms. With new wide-field near-infrared (NIR) imaging that covers the entire
Cloud 2, we discovered two young embedded star clusters located in the two
dense cores of the cloud. Using our NIR and 12CO data as well as HI, radio
continuum, and IRAS data in the archives, we discuss the detailed star
formation processes in this unique environment. We show clear evidences of a
sequential star formation triggered by the nearby huge supernova remnant, GSH
138-01-94. The two embedded clusters show a distinct morphology difference: the
one in the northern molecular cloud core is a loose association with
isolated-mode star formation, while the other in the southern molecular cloud
core is a dense cluster with cluster-mode star formation. We propose that high
compression by the combination of the SNR shell and an adjacent shell caused
the dense cluster formation in the southern core. Along with the low
metallicity range of the EOG, we suggest that EOG could be an excellent
laboratory for the study of star formation processes, such as those triggered
by supernovae, that occured during an early epoch of the Galaxy's formation. In
particular, the study of the EOG may shed light on the origin and role of the
thick disk, whose metallicity range matches with that of the EOG well.

it will be demonstrated how the minimization of a suitable quantity derived

strategy applies also to Siegert states where traditional energy extremization
principle ceases to work. Additionally, the utility of the force concept in
semiclassical mechanics will be investigated.

crystallization, which creates an experimentally inaccessible temperature
regime - a 'no man's land'. We address this and circumvent the crystallization
problem by systematically studying the supercooled dynamics of hydrogen bonded
oligomeric liquids (glycols), where water corresponds to the chain-ends alone.
This novel approach permits a 'dilution of water' by altering the hydrogen bond
concentration via variations in chain length. We observe a dynamic crossover in
the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time for all glycols,
consistent with the common behavior of most supercooled liquids. We find that
the crossover becomes more pronounced for increasing hydrogen bond
concentrations, which leads to the prediction of a marked dynamic transition
for water within 'no man's land' at T~220 K. Interestingly, the predicted
transition thus takes place at a temperature where a so called 'strong-fragile'
transition has previously been suggested. Our results, however, imply that the
dynamic transition of supercooled water is analogous to that commonly observed
in supercooled liquids. Moreover, we find support also for the existence of a
secondary relaxation of water with behavior analogous to that of the secondary
relaxation observed for the glycols.

dynamic (induced by temperature) disorder on the magnetic state and electronic
transport in a metallic system with itinerant metamagnetic instability. Spatial
fluctuations of the local magnetic susceptibility in the alloys lead to a
development of a partially ordered magnetic ground state of the itinerant 3d
electron system. This results in a strong increase of the residual resistivity
and a suppression of the temperature-dependent resistivity. Thermopower
exhibits a complex temperature variation in both the magnetically ordered and

the electronic density of states features in vicinity of Fermi energy and to
the interplay of magnetic and impurity scattering. Our results indicate that
the magnetic enhancement of the Co 3d-band in RCo$_{\rm 2}$--based alloys upon
a substitution of Co by non-magnetic elements is mainly related to a
progressive localization of the Co -- 3d electrons caused by disorder. We show
that the magnitude of the resistivity jump at the Curie temperature for

non-monotonic function of the Curie temperature due to a saturation of the

there are only 7 possible minimal holomorphic immersions of the MIM2 on the

algebra which imply the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP). Possibly the most
important open case is whether a codimension 3 SI-sequence forces the WLP for
level algebras. In other words, does every codimension 3 Gorenstein algebra
have the WLP? We give some new partial answers to this old question: we prove
an affirmative answer when the initial degree is 2, or when the Hilbert
function is relatively small. Then we give a complete answer to the question of
what is the largest socle degree forcing the WLP.

between $d$-dimensional permutations and guillotine partitions of a
$2^{d-1}$-dimensional box is constructed. We also study enumerating problems
related to guillotine partitions under certain restrictions revealing
connections to other combinatorial structures. This allows us to obtain results
on avoided patterns in permutations.

has interesting consequences for collisionless magnetic reconnection because
the Hall term, which plays a crucial role in supporting fast reconnection in
electron-proton plasmas, vanishes. We perform kinetic simulations of pair
reconnection in systems of various sizes, show that it remains fast, and
identify the reason why this occurs. For sufficiently large systems a
Weibel-like temperature anisotropy instability develops in the outflow from the
X-point that causes the current layer to broaden and form a Petschek-like open
outflow. We discuss the parameter regimes in which pair reconnection should be
fast and the implications for astrophysical pair plasmas.

high-resolution electron beam lithography of a 5 nm thick (Ga,Mn)As epilayer.
The unusual behaviour exhibited by these devices is discussed in the context of
existing theories for enhanced AMR ferromagnetic semiconductor nanoscale
devices, particularly with regard to the dependence on the magnetotransport of
the bulk material. We conclude that our results are most consistent with the
Coulomb blockade AMR mechanism.

  Schuttler (Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin 2008)",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of replica symmetry breaking found in the solution of the
mean-field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model has been applied to a
variety of problems in science ranging from biological to computational and
even financial analysis. Thus it is of paramount importance to understand which
predictions of the mean-field solution apply to non-mean-field systems, such as
realistic short-range spin-glass models. The one-dimensional spin glass with
random power-law interactions promises to be an ideal test-bed to answer this
question: Not only can large system sizes-which are usually a shortcoming in
simulations of high-dimensional short-range system-be studied, by tuning the
power-law exponent of the interactions the universality class of the model can
be continuously tuned from the mean-field to the short-range universality
class. We present details of the model, as well as recent applications to some
questions of the physics of spin glasses. First, we study the existence of a
spin-glass state in an external field. In addition, we discuss the existence of
ultrametricity in short-range spin glasses. Finally, because the range of
interactions can be changed, the model is a formidable test-bed for
optimization algorithms.
