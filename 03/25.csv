the naked eye, GRB 080319B at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisite
follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. We present our
detailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over
5000 images starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own
analysis of the Swift data. The event is extreme not only in observed
properties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded at
optical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly high
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. At early times, the
afterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,
but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. The overall spectral
energy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infrared
wavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction in
the host frame. The afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting
at about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red at
late times. In our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidence
for an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. Finally, we examine the
detectability of such events with current and future facilities and find that
such an event could be detected in gamma-rays by BAT out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),
while the nominal EXIST sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. At K band,
this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~
17.

considerable degradations of the PSF. These problems are caused by a drifting
of the satellite attitude due to thermal distortion of the side panel 7, where
the attitude control system is mounted. We found that the position error
averaged over a pointing observation can be largely reduced by using the
relation between the deviation of the source position in the DETX direction and
the ecliptic latitude of the pointing target. We parameterized the wobbling of
the source position synchronized with the satellite orbital period with
temperatures of onboard radiators and elapsed time since the night-day
transition of the spacecraft. We developed software, aeattcor, to correct the
image drift using these parameters, and applied it to 27 point-source images.

differences between polaron formation in dimension one and three, and at small
and large phonon frequency. Varying the anisotropy we demonstrate how a polaron
evolves from a one-dimensional to a three-dimensional quasiparticle. We thereby
resolve the issue of polaron stability in quasi-one-dimensional substances and
clarify to what extent such polarons can be described as one-dimensional
objects. We finally show that even the local Holstein interaction leads to an
enhancement of anisotropy in charge carrier motion.

lead to economic growth (damped, perhaps, by corruption and inconsistencies)?
  Why some restrictions imposed on markets are dangerous? Politicians (and

the easier it is to govern. The reality seems to be more subtle. Some
restrictions are necessary for the markets to function. However, restrictions
on salary, for example, seem to always result in unemployment, as a simple

and none of the extrema is devoid of danger.
  Why should crooked dealings be prevented?

social issue and is subject to an extensive debate in the State of Indiana and
nationwide. With around 800-900 fatalities and thousands of injuries annually
in Indiana, traffic accidents place an incredible social and economic burden on
the state. Still, speed limits posted on highways and other roads are routinely
exceeded as individual drivers try to balance safety and mobility (speed). This
research explores the relationship between speed limits and roadway safety.
Namely, the research focuses on the influence of the posted speed limit on the
causation and severity of accidents. Data on individual accidents from the
Indiana Electronic Vehicle Crash Record System is used in the research, and
appropriate statistical models are estimated for causation and severity of
different types of accidents on all road classes. The results of the modeling
show that speed limits do not have a statistically significant adverse effect
on unsafe-speed-related causation of accidents on all roads, but generally
increase the severity of accidents on the majority of roads other than highways
(the accident severity on highways is unaffected by speed limits). Our findings
can perhaps save both lives and travel time by helping the Indiana Department
of Transportation determine optimal speed limit policies in the state.

further supports the view that the characteristic form of the unconditioned

model the results with minimal conditioning, but in those cases the
distributions are sufficiently narrow that details of their shape aren't

that our atmosphere has an adiabatic temperature distribution, is confirmed for
the lower layers, but the reason why it should be so is understood only
qualitatively. 2. Arguments in which a concept of energy plays a role, in the
context of hydro-thermodynamical systems and gravitation, are often flawed, and
some familiar results concerning the stability of model stellar structures,
first advanced at the end of the 19th century and repeated in the most modern
textbooks, are less than completely convincing. 3. The standard treatment of
relativistic thermodynamics does not allow for a systematic treatment of
mixtures, such as the mixture of a perfect gas with radiation. 4. The concept
of mass in applications of general relativity to stellar structure is
unsatisfactory. It is proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an
action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation of
these matters.
  We formulate thermodynamics of ideal gases in terms of an action principle
and study the interaction between an ideal gas and the photon gas, or heat. The
action principle provides a hamiltonian functional, not available in
traditional approaches where familiar expressions for the energy have no
operative meaning. The usual polytropic atmosphere in an external gravitational
field is examined, in order to determine to what extent it is shaped by
radiation.

statistics of the peaks of Gaussian random fluctuations, and we show that the
extent of assembly bias found in N-body simulations of rare halos is in
excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction. At low masses, we argue
that assembly bias largely arises from a sub-population of low mass halos whose
mass accretion has ceased. Due to their arrested development, these halos
naturally become unbiased, in contrast to their anti-biased peers. We show that

enormous ionized bubbles around luminous quasars (with radii reaching ~40
comoving Mpc), which may survive as ""fossil'' ionized regions long after their
source shuts off. Here we study how the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium
(IGM) evolves inside such fossils. The average recombination rate declines
rapidly with time, and the brief quasar episode significantly increases the
mean free path inside the fossil bubbles. As a result, even a weak ionizing
background generated by galaxies inside the fossil can maintain it in a
relatively highly and uniformly ionized state. For example, galaxies that would
ionize 20-30% of hydrogen in a random patch of the IGM can maintain 80-90%
ionization inside the fossil, for a duration much longer than the average
recombination time in the IGM. Quasar fossils at z<10 thus retain their
identity for nearly a Hubble time, and will appear ""gray,'' distinct from both
the average IGM (which has a ""swiss-cheese"" ionization topology and a lower
mean ionized fraction), and from fully-ionized bubbles around active quasars.
More distant fossils, at z>10 have a weaker galaxy-generated ionizing
background and a higher gas density, so they can attain a swiss-cheese topology
similar to the rest of the IGM, but with a smaller contrast between the ionized
bubbles and the partially neutral regions separating them. Analogous
HeIII-fossils should exist around the epoch of HeII/HeIII reionization at z~3,
although rapid recombinations inside the HeIII-fossils will be more common. Our
model of inhomogeneous recombination also applies to ""double reionization''
models and shows that a non-monotonic reionization history is even more
unlikely than previously thought.

the intrinsic millimeter-wavelength flux of the AzTEC galaxy by a factor of

the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and correcting for the magnification, the
rest-frame FIR luminosity of MMJ065837-5557.0 is $\le 10^{12} \rm L_{\odot}$,

driven by a Poisson stimulus with rate h, the interplay between creation and
annihilation of excitable waves leads to an average activity F. It has recently
been suggested that in the low-stimulus regime (h ~ 0) the response function
F(h) of hypercubic deterministic systems behaves as a power law, F ~ h^m.
Moreover the response exponent m has been predicted to depend only on the
dimensionality d of the lattice, m = 1/(1+d) [T. Ohta and T. Yoshimura, Physica
D 205, 189 (2005)]. In order to test this prediction, we study the response
function of excitable lattices modeled by either coupled Morris-Lecar equations
or Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We show that the prediction is
verified in our model systems for d = 1, 2, and 3, provided that a minimum set
of conditions is satisfied. Under these conditions, the dynamic range - which
measures the range of stimulus intensities that can be coded by the network
activity - increases with the dimensionality d of the network. The power law
scenario breaks down, however, if the system can exhibit self-sustained
activity (spiral waves). In this case, we recover a scenario that is common to
probabilistic excitable media: as a function of the conductance coupling G
among the excitable elements, the dynamic range is maximized precisely at the
critical value G_c above which self-sustained activity becomes stable. We
discuss the implications of these results in the context of neural coding.

the most prominent of which is the ""giant southern stream"". Our previous
analysis indicates that this stream, as well as several other observed
features, are products of the tidal disruption of a single satellite galaxy
with stellar mass ~10^9 solar masses less than 1 Gyr ago. Here we show that the
specific observed morphology of the stream and halo debris favors a cold,
rotating, disk-like progenitor over a dynamically hot, non-rotating one. These
observed characteristics include the asymmetric distribution of stars along the
stream cross-section and its metal-rich core/metal-poor sheath structure. We
find that a disk-like progenitor can also give rise to arc-like features on the
minor axis at certain orbital phases that resemble the recently discovered
minor-axis ""streams"", even reproducing the lower observed metallicity of these
streams. Though interpreted by the discoverers as new, independent tidal
streams, our analysis suggests that these minor-axis streams may alternatively
arise from the progenitor of the giant southern stream. Overall, our study
points the way to a more complete reconstruction of the stream progenitor and
its merger with M31, based on the emerging picture that most of the major
inhomogeneities observed in the M31 halo share a common origin with the giant
stream.

conversion of our measurements into the Lick/IDS system was carried out
following the general prescription of Worthey and Ottaviani 1997. Comparisons
of our measurements with those of other authors show, in general, good
agreement. We also examine the dependence between these indices (e.g., Hbeta,
Mg_2, Fe5270 and NaD) and the central velocity dispersion (sigma), and we find
that they are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.
Benefiting from the relatively large size of the sample, we are able to
investigate the dependence of these relations on morphology and environment,
here represented by the local galaxy density. We find that for metallic lines
these relations show no significant dependence on environment or morphology,
except in the case of NaD, which shows distinct behavior for E and S0. On the
other hand, the Hbeta-logsigma shows a significant difference as a function of
the local density of galaxies, which we interpret as being caused by the
truncation of star formation in high density environments. Comparing our
results with those obtained by other authors we find a few discrepancies,
adding to the ongoing debate about the nature of these relations. Finally, we
report that the scatter of the Mg indices versus sigma relations correlate with
Hbeta, suggesting that age may contribute to the scatter. Furthermore, this
scatter shows no significant dependence on morphology or environment. Our
results are consistent with the current downsizing model, where low mass
galaxies have an extended star formation history (abridged).

both are located in low metallicity galaxies. We analyze the current state of
the systems and demonstrate that both systems will very quickly ($\lesssim 0.3$
Myr) form close BH-BH binaries with the short coalescence time ($\sim 3$ Gyr)
and large chirp mass ($\sim 15 \msun$). The formation of BH-BH system seems
unavoidable, as {\em (i)} WR companions are well within their Roche lobes and
they do not expand so no Roche lobe overflow is expected, {\em (ii)} even
intense WR wind mass loss does not remove sufficient mass to prohibit the
formation of the second BH, {\em (ii)} even if BH receives the large natal
kick, the systems are very closely bound and are almost impossible to disrupt.

the current gravitational wave instruments LIGO/VIRGO (initial stage) can
detect such massive BH-BH mergers out to $\sim 200$ Mpc, the empirically

not sensitive to massive inspirals or there is some fundamental
misunderstanding of stellar evolution physics leading directly to the formation

are rare objects, and none have been found so far around early-type M dwarfs
M0V-M5V). With GJ 1046 (M2.5V), a strong candidate for such a system with a
separation of 0.42 AU is presented.
  Aims. We aim at constraining the mass of the companion in order to decide
whether it is a brown dwarf or a low-mass star.
  Methods. We employed precision RV measurements to determine the orbital
parameters and the minimum companion mass. We then derived an upper limit to
the companion mass from the lack of disturbances of the RV measurements by a
secondary spectrum. An even tighter upper limit is subsequently established by
combining the RV-derived orbital parameters with the recent new version of the
Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data.
  Results. For the mass of the companion, we derive m>26.9 MJup from the RV
data. Based on the RV data alone, the probability that the companion exceeds
the stellar mass threshold is just 6.2%. The absence of effects from the
secondary spectrum lets us constrain the companion mass to m <229 MJup. The
combination of RV and Hipparcos data yields a 3sigma upper mass limit to the
companion mass of 112 MJup with a formal optimum value at m=47.2 MJup. From the
combination of RV and astrometric data, the chance probability that the
companion is a star is 2.9%.
  Conclusions. We have found a low-mass, close companion to an early-type M
dwarf. While the most likely interpretation of this object is that it is a
brown dwarf, a low-mass stellar companion is not fully excluded.

helioseismology led to a huge step forward in our knowledge about the internal

influence on the electron spin dynamics, via the hyperfine interaction. Quantum
dots, with their comparatively limited number of nuclei, present
electron-nuclear behavior that is unique to low-dimensional systems. We show
that the conventional Hanle effect used to measure electron spin relaxation
times, for example, cannot be used in these systems when the spin lifetimes are
long. An individual nucleus in the QD is subject to milli-Tesla effective
fields, arising from the interaction with its nearest-neighbors and with the
electronic Knight field. The alignment of each nucleus is influenced by
application of external fields of the same magnitude. A polarized nuclear
system, which may have an effective field strength of several Tesla, may easily
be influenced by these milli-Tesla fields. This in turn has a dramatic effect
on the electron spin dynamics, and we use this technique to gain a measure of
both the dipole-dipole field and the maximum Knight field in our system, thus
allowing us to estimate the maximum Overhauser field that may be generated at
zero external magnetic field. We also show that one may fine-tune the angle

Its expectation value is dominated by a semi-classical string worldsheet, as
for Wilson loops. We also discuss the deformation of the model by this

can be thought of as a generalization of a quark mass term to strong coupling.
It leads to the first top-down holographic model of QCD with a non-Abelian

variable SDSS 1507+52. The star shows very deep eclipses on the 67 minute
orbital period, and those eclipses are easily separable into white-dwarf and
hot-spot components. This leads to tight constraints on binary parameters, with
M_1=0.83(8) solar masses, M_2=0.057(8) solar masses, R_1=0.0097(9) solar radii,
R_2=0.097(4) solar radii, q=0.069(2), and i=83.18(13) degrees. Such numbers
suggest possible membership among the WZ Sge stars, a common type of dwarf
nova. The spectroscopic behavior (strong and broad H emission, double-peaked
and showing a classic rotational disturbance during eclipse) is also typical.
But the star's orbital period is shockingly below the ""period minimum"" of
approximately 77 min which is characteristic of hydrogen-rich CVs; producing
such a strange binary will require some tinkering with the theory of
cataclysmic-variable evolution. The proper motion is also remarkably high for a
star of its distance, which we estimate from photometry and trigonometric
parallax as 230 +- 40 pc. This suggests a transverse velocity of 164 +- 30 km/s
- uncomfortably high if the star belongs to a Galactic-disk population. These
difficulties with understanding its evolution and space velocity can be solved
if the star belongs to a Galactic-halo population.

product of functions separable in the potential and the radial coordinate,
where the functions of the radial coordinate are powers of a sum of a square of
the radial coordinate and its unit scale. The even part of the two-integral DF
corresponding to this type of density is in turn a sum or an infinite series of

be also obtained under the assumption of the rotation laws. It can be further
shown that these expressions are in fact equivalent to those obtained by using

generally computationally preferable to the contour integral method. Two

the change of Ce valence character. Spin polarized calculations point to a
finite magnetic moment carried by the Ce $ 4f $ states; its magnitude increases
with $ x_H $ in the range $ 1 \leq x_H \leq 1.33 $.

the direction of the HH 240/241 outflow and associated with IRAS 05173-0555,

kinematics of the gas suggest that the origin of the cross-like morphology
could be the interaction between the outflow and the envelope. A more compact

the outflow, has been detected towards the center of the cross-like envelope.
The northern stream, which has properties and velocity different from those of
the cross-like envelope, is likely part of the original cloud envelope, and
could be either a quiescent core that would never form stars, or be in a
prestellar phase.

spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation field,
which can be characterized as y-type distortion when the injection process
started at redshifts z<~ 5x10^4. Here we demonstrate that if energy was
released before the beginning of cosmological hydrogen recombination (z~1400),
closed loops of bound-bound and free-bound transitions in HI and HeII lead to
the appearance of (i) characteristic multiple narrow spectral features at dm
and cm wavelengths, and (ii) a prominent sub-millimeter feature consisting of
absorption and emission parts in the far Wien tail of CMB spectrum. The
additional spectral features are generated in the pre-recombinational epoch of
HI (z>~1800) and HeII (z>~7000), and therefore differ from those arising due to
normal cosmological recombination in the undisturbed CMB blackbody radiation
field. We present the results of numerical computations including 25 atomic
shells for both HI and HeII, and discuss the contributions of several
individual transitions in detail. As examples, we consider the case of
instantaneous energy release (e.g. due to phase transitions) and exponential
energy release because of long-lived decaying particles. Our computations show
that due to possible pre-recombinational atomic transitions the variability of
the CMB spectral distortion increases when comparing with the distortions
arising in the normal recombination epoch. The existence of these narrow
spectral features would open an unique way to separate y-distortions due to
pre-recombinational ($1400<~ z <~5x10^4) energy release from those arising in
the post-recombinational era at redshifts z<~800. (abridged)

stellar spectroscopy. Aims: We aim at a spectroscopic determination of the
abundance of Hf and Th in the solar photosphere based on a \cobold 3D
hydrodynamical model atmosphere. We put this into a wider context by
investigating 3D abundance corrections for a set of G- and F-type dwarfs.
Method: High-resolution, high signal-to-noise solar spectra were compared to
line synthesis calculations performed on a solar CO5BOLD model. For the other
atmospheres, we compared synthetic spectra of CO5BOLD 3D and associated 1D
models. Results: For Hf we find a photospheric abundance A(Hf)=0.87+-0.04, in
good agreement with a previous analysis, based on 1D model atmospheres. The
weak Th ii 401.9 nm line constitutes the only Th abundance indicator available
in the solar spectrum. It lies in the red wing of an Ni-Fe blend exhibiting a
non-negligible convective asymmetry. Accounting for the asymmetry-related
additional absorption, we obtain A(Th)=0.09+-0.03, consistent with the
meteoritic abundance, and about 0.1 dex lower than obtained in previous
photospheric abundance determinations. Conclusions: Only for the second time,
to our knowledge, has am non-negligible effect of convective line asymmetries
on an abundance derivation been highlighted. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations should be employed to measure Th abundances in dwarfs if similar
blending is present, as in the solar case. In contrast, 3D effects on Hf
abundances are small in G- to mid F-type dwarfs and sub-giants, and 1D model
atmospheres can be conveniently used.

study predicts an intertube vdW bonding with a strength that is consistent with
recent observations for the interlayer binding in graphitics. It also produce a
nanotube wall-to-wall separation which is in very good agreement with
