wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for achieving effective transmission and hence
better power conservation. Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are
either hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes
considering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data
aggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data
aggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data
aggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data
aggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.
  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs
deployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our
proposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop
protocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our
protocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity
along with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation
process which is $O(\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for
further verification of aggregated results.

deploy security features and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of
economic reasons arising from the presence of network externalities. Our goal
in this paper is to carefully model and quantify the impact of such
externalities on the investment in, and deployment of, security features and
protocols in a network.
  Specifically, we study a network of interconnected agents, which are subject
to epidemic risks such as those caused by propagating viruses and worms, and
which can decide whether or not to invest some amount to self-protect and
deploy security solutions. We make three contributions in the paper. First, we
introduce a general model which combines an epidemic propagation model with an
economic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities.
Second, borrowing ideas and techniques used in statistical physics, we
introduce a Local Mean Field (LMF) model, which extends the standard mean-field
approximation to take into account the correlation structure on local
neighborhoods. Third, we solve the LMF model in a network with externalities,
and we derive analytic solutions for sparse random graphs, for which we obtain
asymptotic results. We explicitly identify the impact of network externalities
on the decision to invest in and deploy security features. In other words, we
identify both the economic and network properties that determine the adoption
of security technologies.

the baryon density (5.9 < eta_10 < 6.4 at 95% confidence), independent of N_nu,

the best fit values and the allowed ranges of the CMB/LSS-derived parameters to

absence of a signal. Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random
walk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range
of the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single,
isolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the
absence of external cues. We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and
Polysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10
sec intervals for ~10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity,
turning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results
to the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. We find
that amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion:
Amoebae show a long persistence time (~10 min) beyond which they start to lose
their direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns
every 1-2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn
and turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and
turns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be
exponentially distributed. We show that this behavior greatly improves their
chances of finding a target relative to performing a random walk. We believe
that other eukaryotic cells may employ a strategy similar to Dictyostelium when
seeking conditions or signal sources not yet within range of their detection
system.

discontinuity, respectively. The elemental abundance is poorly constrained by
the spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,
there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. This
would imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or Mach
1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external
(internal) to the discontinuity. Alternatively, pressure balance could be
maintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in the
elemental abundance. We suggest that the observed discontinuity is the result
of non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recent
merger. In this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients are
important in the visibility of the discontinuity. Cen A is in the late stages
of merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in density
and abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the two
galaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after the
merger. The pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on the
temporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. The jet could have decollimated
crossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

gating the interaction using the field gradient of a driving pulse with a

carrier-wave self-steepened (CSS) pulses. This goes beyond existing treatments,
which only consider third-order nonlinearity, and has the advantage of
describing pulses whose wave forms have a range of symmetry properties.
Although a fertile field for theoretical work, CSS pulses are difficult to
realize experimentally because of the deleterious effect of dispersion. We
therefore consider synthesizing CSS-like profiles using a suitably phased
sub-set of the harmonics present in a true CSS wave form. Using standard
theoretical models of HHG, we show that the presence of gradient-maximized
regions on the wave forms can raise the spectral cut-off and so yield shorter
attosecond pulses. We study how the quality of the attosecond bursts created by
spectral filtering depends on the number of harmonics included in the driving
pulse.

$\gtrsim 25 M_\sun$; for the other 3, these data are consistent with a wide

planets and atmosphereless bodies. Results. Calculations show that polarization
phase curves for spherical grains exhibit a sharp transition over a narrow
range of size parameter between two distinct regimes, one typical of Rayleigh
scattering and another dominated by a large NPB. The linear polarimetric
signature observed for aggregates is a composite of a) the polarization induced
by individual grains composing the aggregate and b) the polarization due to the
aggregate as a whole dust grain. The weight of each component varies depending
on the porosity of the aggregate. An NPB similar to the one observed for
atmosphereless astronomical bodies is present for different ranges of the size
parameter depending on the value of the porosity. It appears as a remnant of

X-ray--to--optical mean luminosity ratio (L_X/L_B) and the
X-ray--to--stellar-mass mean ratio (L_X/M*) for galaxy populations selected by
L_B and M*, respectively. When analyzing galaxy samples selected via SFR, we
find that the mean X-ray--to--SFR ratio (L_X/SFR) is consistent with being
constant over the entire redshift range for galaxies with SFR = 1--100 Msol

activity (as traced by X-ray luminosity) per unit stellar mass in a given
redshift bin increases with decreasing stellar mass over the redshift range z =
0.2--1, which is consistent with previous studies of how star-formation
activity depends on stellar mass. Finally, we extend our X-ray analyses to

We develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phase

the transformation from map to light curve. We discuss numerical approaches to
extracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining how

provides a better fit to the planet's underlying brightness map, although the

information over a wide range of mass scales, from individual galaxies to
galaxy clusters. N-body simulations have established that the
friends-of-friends (FOF) mass function has a universal form to a surprising
level of accuracy (< 10%). The high-mass tail of the mass function is
exponentially sensitive to the amplitude of the initial density perturbations,
the mean matter density parameter, Omega_m, and to the dark energy controlled
late-time evolution of the density field. Observed group and cluster masses,
however, are usually stated in terms of a spherical overdensity (SO) mass which
does not map simply to the FOF mass. Additionally, the widely used halo models
of structure formation -- and halo occupancy distribution descriptions of
galaxies within halos -- are often constructed exploiting the universal form of
the FOF mass function. This again raises the question of whether FOF halos can
be simply related to the notion of a spherical overdensity mass. By employing
results from Monte Carlo realizations of ideal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos
and N-body simulations, we study the relationship between the two definitions
of halo mass. We find that the vast majority of halos (80-85%) in the
mass-range 10^{12.5}-10^{15.5} M_sun/h indeed allow for an accurate mapping
between the two definitions (~ 5%), but only if the halo concentrations are
known. Nonisolated halos fall into two broad classes: those with complex
substructure that are poor fits to NFW profiles and those ``bridged'' by the
(isodensity-based)FOF algorithm. A closer investigation of the bridged halos
reveals that the fraction of these halos and their satellite mass distribution

with a range of dark halo density profiles, including two-dimensional
kinematics at smaller radii from SAURON data. Within our assumptions, the
best-fitted model gives a total enclosed mass of 2.0x10^11 M_sun within 100

little to no dark matter halo in this galaxy from planetary nebula

best-fitted model; both the no dark halo and NFW models are worse fits at a
greater than 99% confidence level. NGC 821 does not appear to have the expected
dark halo density profile. The internal moments of the stellar velocity
distribution show that the model with no dark halo is radially anisotropic at
small radii and tangentially isotropic at large radii, while the best-fitted
halo models are slightly radially anisotropic at all radii. We test the

with a clearing at closer radii inside this annulus, suggests the formation of
at least one small body at an orbital distance of about 100 AU. This structure
seems consistent with crude models of mean motion resonances, or accumulation
of material at two of the Lagrange points relative to the putative object and
the star. We also report a low significance detection of a point source in this

kpc. Stellar circular velocities were obtained using two-integral dynamical
models. Distances were obtained by comparing, at each radius, the stellar
circular velocities with synthetic H_alpha rotation curves derived from NIR
Tully-Fisher relations.The results show that most of our galaxies are located
within 4 Mpc of the core of the cluster. Three of these galaxies, previously
classified as ""low rotator galaxies"" or with ""Truncated/Compact"" H_alpha radial
distributions, have stellar kinematics-based distances that are discrepant with
HI-based distances by at least 60%, and are likely to be located within the
virial radius of the cluster. These discrepancies appear due to very truncated
gas distributions plus non-circular gas motions or gas motions not in the plane

first order form, has shown that as well as secondary first class constraints,
tertiary first class constraints also arise, with an unusual nonlocal Poisson
bracket (PB) algebra among first class constraints [8 ]. This approach is
different from that of ADM in that of the equations of motion which are
independent of the time derivative of fields only those which correspond to
second class constraints (in the sense of the Dirac constraint formalism) are
used to eliminate fields from the action. In this paper, we consider coupling
of a cosmological term, massive scalar fields, Maxwell gauge fields and
Yang-Mills fields to the first order EH action in this formalism, and show that
in spite of the apparent differences with the ADM results in the Hamiltonian
formulation of the first order EH action and its constraint structure, the
generic properties of the ADM Hamiltonian formulation of the first order EH
action in the presence of Bosonic matter are derivable from this novel
Hamiltonian formulation. Addition of a massive scalar field to the EH action
leaves the PB algebra of constraints unaltered, and when the Yang-Mills fields
or Maxwell gauge fields are coupled to the EH action, the PB algebra of the
constraints pertaining to the EH action receives linear contributions from the
generator of the gauge transformations of the action for matter fields, and
those generators form a closed algebra amongst themselves. Moreover, it is
found that for closed spaces, the Hamiltonian of the EH action coupled to
Bosonic matter is weakly zero on the constraint surface defined by the first
class constraints, including the constraints arising from the matter fields.

introduced to analyze low resolution (~5 AE) spectra, which yields
metallicities accurate to 0.2 dex including the uncertainties arising from the
errors in Teff (5%) and log g (0.2 dex). For the first time the stellar
metallicity gradient based on elements such as titanium and iron in a galaxy
beyond the Local Group is investigated. Solar metallicity is measured in the
center and 0.3 solar in the outskirts and a logarithmic gradient of -0.08
dex/kpc. An average reddening of E(B-V)~0.12 mag is obtained, however with a
large variation from 0.07 to 0.24 mag. We also determine stellar radii,
luminosities and masses and discuss the evolutionary status. Finally, the
observed relationship between absolute bolometric magnitudes M_{bol} and flux
weighted gravities g_{F} = g/Teff^4 is investigated. At high temperatures the
strengths of the Balmer lines depends solely on the flux-weighted gravity,
which allows a precise direct determination of log g_{F} with an accuracy of
0.05 to 0.1 dex. We find a tight relationship between M_{bol} and log g_{F} in
agreement with stellar evolution theory. Combining these new results with
previous work on Local Group galaxies we obtain a new flux weighted gravity
luminosity relationship (FGLR), which is very well defined and appears to be an
excellent alternative tool to determine distances to galaxies.

consider the symmetric weight given as $w_{ij}=(k_i k_j)^\alpha$. In CA model,
the mass $m_i$ on the randomly chosen node $i$ diffuses to a linked neighbor of

critical $\alpha_c$ exists below which CA model undergoes the same type of the

$\alpha \geq \alpha_c$, the condensation always occurs for any density $\rho$

walkers simultaneously at the same node with degree $k$. We find $P^{\infty}_k
\sim k^{\alpha+1-\gamma}$ and $D(k) \sim k^{2(\alpha+1)-\gamma}$ respectively.
With $P^{\infty}_k$, we also show analytically and numerically that the average
mass $m(k)$ on a node with degree $k$ scales as $k^{\alpha+1}$ without any
jumps at the maximal degree of the network for any $\rho$ as in the SFNs with

machine learning and has achieved great success in real applications. However,
the standard SVM can not select variables automatically and therefore its
solution typically utilizes all the input variables without discrimination.
This makes it difficult to identify important predictor variables, which is
often one of the primary goals in data analysis. In this paper, we propose two
novel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM)
for simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally
requires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax
rule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize
its importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with
different functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to
a penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we
propose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on
different variables according to their relative importance. Both types of
regularization automate variable selection in the process of building
classifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced
interpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low
sample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy
implementation via standard linear programming. Several simulated examples and
one real gene data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the
adaptive supnorm penalty in various data settings.

stumbled upon a crypt. Archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority

system manifests a quantum decoherence which is more and more significant in
time. We also calculate the decoherence time and show that it has the same
scale as the time after which thermal fluctuations become comparable with
quantum fluctuations. Then we solve the master equation for two independent
harmonic oscillators interacting with an environment in the asymptotic
long-time regime. We give a description of the continuous-variable asymptotic
entanglement in terms of the covariance matrix of the quantum states of the
considered system for an arbitrary Gaussian input state. Using the Peres-Simon
necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two-mode Gaussian
states, we show that the two non-interacting systems immersed in a common
environment become asymptotically entangled for certain environments, so that
in the long-time regime they manifest non-local quantum correlations.

kinematics of simulated spiral galaxies. Additional emphasis is put on the
question of how the resulting distortions of the gaseous disc are visible in
the rotation curve and/or the full 2D velocity field of galaxies at different
redshifts. A Milky-Way type disc galaxy is modelled in combined
N-body/hydrodynamic simulations with prescriptions for cooling, star formation,
stellar feedback, and galactic winds. This model galaxy moves through a
constant density and temperature gas, which has parameters similar to the
intra-cluster medium (ICM). Rotation curves (RCs) and 2D velocity fields of the
gas are extracted from these simulations in a way that follows the procedure
applied to observations of distant, small, and faint galaxies as closely as
possible. We find that the appearance of distortions of the gaseous disc due to
ram-pressure stripping depends on the direction of the acting ram pressure. In
the case of face-on ram pressure, the distortions mainly appear in the outer
parts of the galaxy in a very symmetric way. In contrast, in the case of
edge-on ram pressure we find stronger distortions. The 2D velocity field also
shows signatures of the interaction in the inner part of the disc. At angles
smaller than 45 degrees between the ICM wind direction and the disc, the
velocity field asymmetry increases significantly compared to larger angles.
Compared to distortions caused by tidal interactions, the effects of
ram-pressure stripping on the velocity field are relatively low in all cases
and difficult to observe at intermediate redshift in seeing-limited
observations. (abridged)

Formally, the data structure must store a function f: U ->{0,1}^r that has
specified values on the elements of a given set S, a subset of U, |S|=n, but
may have any value on elements outside S. Minimal perfect hashing makes it
possible to avoid storing the set S, but this induces a space overhead of
Theta(n) bits in addition to the nr bits needed for function values. In this
paper we show how to eliminate this overhead. Moreover, we show that for any k
query time O(k) can be achieved using space that is within a factor 1+e^{-k} of
optimal, asymptotically for large n. If we allow logarithmic evaluation time,
the additive overhead can be reduced to O(log log n) bits whp. The time to
construct the data structure is O(n), expected. A main technical ingredient is
to utilize existing tight bounds on the probability of almost square random
matrices with rows of low weight to have full row rank. In addition to direct
constructions, we point out a close connection between retrieval structures and
hash tables where keys are stored in an array and some kind of probing scheme
is used. Further, we propose a general reduction that transfers the results on
retrieval into analogous results on approximate membership, a problem
traditionally addressed using Bloom filters. Again, we show how to eliminate
the space overhead present in previously known methods, and get arbitrarily
close to the lower bound. The evaluation procedures of our data structures are
extremely simple (similar to a Bloom filter). For the results stated above we
assume free access to fully random hash functions. However, we show how to
justify this assumption using extra space o(n) to simulate full randomness on a

binomial-variable proportion, with a given (observed) number of qualifying
attempts (called ``at-bats''), an observed number of successes (``hits'')
distributed according to the binomial distribution, and with a true (but
unknown) value of $p_i$ that represents the player's latent ability. This is a
common data structure in many statistical applications; and so the
methodological study here has implications for such a range of applications. We
look at batting records for each Major League player over the course of a
single season (2005). The primary focus is on using only the batting records
from an earlier part of the season (e.g., the first 3 months) in order to
estimate the batter's latent ability, $p_i$, and consequently, also to predict
their batting-average performance for the remainder of the season. Since we are
using a season that has already concluded, we can then validate our estimation
performance by comparing the estimated values to the actual values for the
remainder of the season. The prediction methods to be investigated are
motivated from empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes interpretations. A newly
proposed nonparametric empirical Bayes procedure performs particularly well in
the basic analysis of the full data set, though less well with analyses
involving more homogeneous subsets of the data. In those more homogeneous
situations better performance is obtained from appropriate versions of more
familiar methods. In all situations the poorest performing choice is the

fluctuations as prominent examples. While first measurements of quantum charge
transport date back to the 1980s, spin phenomena in mesoscopic transport have
moved only recently into the focus of attention, as one branch of the field of
spintronics. The interplay between quantum coherence with confinement-,
disorder- or interaction-effects gives rise to a variety of unexpected spin
phenomena in mesoscopic conductors and allows moreover to control and engineer
the spin of the charge carriers: spin interference is often the basis for
spin-valves, -filters, -switches or -pumps. Their underlying mechanisms may

mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, it suffers from two crucial problems. One
is the \mu-/B \mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former
stems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the
gravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft
masses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose
branching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a
model of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In
this axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale
is dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry
breaking effects, and the \mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in
our model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the
superpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of
modulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the
mirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The
next-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the
axino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today. It
is shown that the axino with the mass of O(100) MeV is naturally realized,
which can constitute the dark matter of the Universe, with the free-streaming
length of the order of 0.1 Mpc. The saxion, the real scalar component of the
axion supermultiplet, can also be cosmologically harmless due to the dilution
of the modulus decay. The lifetime of NLSP is relatively long, but much shorter
than 1 sec., when the big-bang nucleosynthesis commences. The decay of NLSP
would provide intriguing collider signatures.

level (3 sigma) of linear polarisation in four sources. The polarisation is
found to be intrinsic (at the > 3 sigma level) in two sources; GRO J1655-40 (~
4-7% in H and Ks-bands during an outburst) and Sco X-1 (~ 0.1-0.9% in H and K),
which is stronger at lower frequencies. This is likely to be the signature of
optically thin synchrotron emission from the collimated jets in these systems,
whose presence indicates a partially-ordered magnetic field is present at the
inner regions of the jets. In Sco X-1 the intrinsic polarisation is variable
(and sometimes absent) in the H and K-bands. In the J-band (i.e. at higher
frequencies) the polarisation is not significantly variable and is consistent
with an interstellar origin. The optical light from GX 339-4 is also polarised,
but at a level and position angle consistent with scattering by interstellar
dust. The other polarised source is SS 433, which has a low level (0.5-0.8%) of
J-band polarisation, likely due to local scattering. The NIR counterparts of
GRO J0422+32, XTE J1118+480, 4U 0614+09 and Aql X-1 (which were all in or near

diffusion directions, which are proxies for neural fiber directions. We
consider a study in which diffusion direction maps were acquired for two groups
of subjects. The objective of the analysis is to find regions of the brain in
which the corresponding diffusion directions differ between the groups. This is
attained by first computing a test statistic for the difference in direction at
every brain location using a Watson model for directional data. Interesting
locations are subsequently selected with control of the false discovery rate.
More accurate modeling of the null distribution is obtained using an empirical
null density based on the empirical distribution of the test statistics across
the brain. Further, substantial improvements in power are achieved by local
spatial averaging of the test statistic map. Although the focus is on one
particular study and imaging technology, the proposed inference methods can be
applied to other large scale simultaneous hypothesis testing problems with a
continuous underlying spatial structure.

asymptotics for the density of $Z_U^{(p)}$ near 0. Similar limit theorems are
given for the orthogonal and symplectic groups, relying on results of Killip
and Nenciu.

transform of a product of two Slater-type orbitals located on different atomic
centers is derived. The result is valid for arbitrary quantum numbers and was
found to be numerically stable for a wide range of geometrical parameters and
momenta. Details of the implementation are presented together with benchmark
data for representative integrals. We also discuss the assets and drawbacks of
alternative algorithms available and analyze the numerical efficiency of the
new scheme.

free networks by analyzing the properties of the corresponding gradient
networks (Z. Toroczkai, K. E. Bassler, Nature {\bf 428}, 716 (2004)). Using the
Family model (F. Family, J. Phys. A, {\bf 19}, L441 (1986)) from surface-growth
physics as single-step load-balancing dynamics, we show that the congestion
pressure considerably drops on scale-free networks when compared with the same
dynamics on random graphs. This is due to a structural transition of the
corresponding gradient network clusters, which self-organize such as to reduce
the congestion pressure. This reduction is enhanced when lowering the value of
the connectivity exponent $\lambda$ towards 2.

randomization does not justify the models, bias is likely; nor are the usual
variance calculations to be trusted. Here, we evaluate regression adjustments
using Neyman's nonparametric model. Previous results are generalized, and more
intuitive proofs are given. A bias term is isolated, and conditions are given
for unbiased estimation in finite samples.
