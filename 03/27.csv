evolution of neutrino flavor in core collapse supernovae. Solution of this
problem requires a numerical approach which can simulate accurately the quantum
mechanical coupling of intersecting neutrino trajectories and the associated
nonlinearity which characterizes neutrino flavor conversion. We describe here
the two codes developed to attack this problem. We also describe the surprising
phenomena revealed by these numerical calculations. Chief among these is that
the nonlinearities in the problem can engineer neutrino flavor transformation
which is dramatically different than in standard Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
treatments. This happens even though the neutrino mass-squared differences are
measured to be small, and even when neutrino self-coupling is sub-dominant. Our
numerical work has revealed potential signatures which, if detected in the
neutrino burst from a Galactic core collapse event, could reveal heretofore
unmeasurable properties of the neutrinos, such as the mass hierarchy and vacuum
mixing angle theta_13.

cosmological constant dominated one ($\Lambda$CDM); the XCDM parameterization
of dark energy; and a slowly-rolling scalar field model with inverse-power-law
potential energy density. (Instead of using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain
method, when integrating over nuisance parameters we use an alternative method
of introducing an auxiliary random variable.) The resulting constraints are
consistent with, and typically more constraining than, those derived from other
cosmological data. A time-independent cosmological constant is a good fit to
the galaxy cluster data, but slowly evolving dark energy cannot yet be ruled
out.

feature of this new reactor is a three net AB reflector, which confines the
high temperature plasma. The plasma loses part of its energy when it contacts
with the net but this loss can be compensated by an additional permanent plasma
heating. When the plasma is rarefied (has a small density), the heat flow to
the AB reflector is not large and the temperature in the triple reflector net
is lower than 2000 - 3000 K. This offered AB-reactor has significantly less
power then the currently contemplated power reactors with magnetic or inertial
confinement (hundreds-thousands of kW, not millions of kW). But it is enough
for many vehicles and ships and particularly valuable for tunnelers, subs and
space apparatus, where air to burn chemical fuel is at a premium or simply not
available.
  The author has made a number of innovations in this reactor, researched its
theory, developed methods of computation, made a sample computation of typical
project. The main point of preference for the offered reactor is its likely
cheapness as a power source.

limits for the collection of all percolation interfaces in the plane: (1) a
trivial one, consisting of no curves at all, (2) a critical one, in which all
points of the plane are surrounded by arbitrarily large loops and every
deterministic point is almost surely surrounded by a countably infinite family
of nested loops with radii going to zero, and (3) an intermediate one, in which
every deterministic point of the plane is almost surely surrounded by a largest
loop and by a countably infinite family of nested loops with radii going to
zero. We show how one can prove this using elementary arguments, with the help
of known scaling relations for percolation.
  The trivial limit corresponds to subcritical and supercritical percolation,
as well as to the case when the density p approaches the critical probability,
p_c, sufficiently slowly as the lattice spacing is sent to zero. The second
type corresponds to critical percolation and to a faster approach of p to p_c.
The third, or near-critical, type of limit corresponds to an intermediate speed
of approach of p to p_c. The fact that in the near-critical case a
deterministic point is a.s. surrounded by a largest loop demonstrates the
persistence of a macroscopic correlation length in the scaling limit and the
absence of scale invariance.

Distance zero captures probabilistic bisimilarity. Each pseudometric has a

beamed by a Lorentz factor Gamma, the bursts or flares have to last at least
~0.1 Gamma^{-4} A^{-4} yr. A considerable fraction of the flare luminosity
could go into highest energy cosmic rays, in which case the rate of flares per

traditional semiconductors. Single-stranded DNA has been employed to make these
desirable properties accessible for large scale fabrication of devices. Because
single-stranded DNA can helically wrap a SWNT, forming a stable hybrid
structure, DNA/polymer wrapping has been used to disperse bundles of
intrinsically hydrophobic SWNTs into individual tubes in aqueous solution. The
ability to isolate individual tubes, make them soluble, and separate them
according to symmetry would enable fabrication of SWNT optoelectronic devices
that benefit from the unique electronic properties of specific nanotube
structures. Envisioning optoelectronic applications of nanotubes, we
investigate whether the optical properties of DNA-wrapped SWNT materials are
different than those of pristine SWNTs. Our previous work found that
bandstructures of DNA-SWNTs were indeed affected by the charged wrap. That is,
the direct optical bandgap, $E_{11}$, decreases, but changes are fairly small.
This is consistent with the available experimental data in standard
experimental geometry in which incident light is polarized along the SWNT axis.
Here we consider optical absorption of light with perpendicular (or circular)
polarization with respect to the tube axis, which has been measured
experimentally for SWNTs dispersed using a surfactant. In this geometry we find
qualitative changes in the absorption spectra of SWNTs upon hybridization with

ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm
can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global
solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical
numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond
six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the
collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron
star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope. We find that the
size of the presupernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure
inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the
jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated
fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 400$ and a half-opening
angle $\theta_j\sim 2^\circ$, consistent with observations of many
long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give
$\gamma$ in the range 100 to 5000 and $\theta_j$ from $0.1^\circ$ to
$10^\circ$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A
potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum
Poynting flux in the jet is found at $\theta \sim \theta_j$ with the jet power
concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs
at an angle $\theta$ substantially smaller than $\theta_j$ also in a hollow
cone. [abridged]

processes where the Wtb interaction involves off-shell top and/or bottom

the conventional MOSFET limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature leading to
smaller off-currents and standby power dissipation. Phonon assisted tunneling,
however, limits the off-state performance benefits that could have been
achieved otherwise. Under on-state conditions the drive current and the
intrinsic device delay of the TFET are mainly governed by the tunneling barrier
properties. On the other hand, the switching energy for the TFET is observed to
be fundamentally smaller than that for the MOSFET, reducing the dynamic power
dissipation. Aforementioned reasons make the p-i-n geometry well suited for low

plays a crucial role in driving evaporating flows and supplying baryonic
matters into the magnetosphere. The loaded baryonic matter, that is called

a quasi-force-free equilibrium of the magnetosphere. Finally the prominence is
erupted by the magnetic pressure force due to the loss of equilibrium triggered
by the explosive magnetic reconnection. The giant flare should be induced as a
final outcome of the prominence eruption accompanied by large-scale field
reconfigurations. An essential difference between solar and magnetar flares is
the control process of their evolutionary dynamics. The flaring activity on
magnetars is mainly controlled by the radiative process unlike the solar flare
governed by the electron conduction. It is highly suggestive that our model is

based on the previously estimated luminosities is in serious disagreement with
the current stellar evolution theory. The dust envelope around WOH G64 has been
spatially resolved with a baseline of ~60 m--the first MIDI observations to
resolve an individual stellar source in an extragalactic system. The observed
N-band visibilities show a slight decrease from 8 to 10 micron and a gradual
increase longward of 10 micron, reflecting the 10 micron silicate feature in
self-absorption. The visibilities measured at four position angles differing by
~60 degrees but at approximately the same baseline length (~60 m) do not show a
noticeable difference, suggesting that the object appears nearly
centrosymmetric. The observed N-band visibilities and spectral energy
distribution can be reproduced by an optically and geometrically thick silicate
torus model viewed close to pole-on. The luminosity of the central star is
derived to be 2.8 x 10^5 Lsun, which is by a factor of 2 lower than the
previous estimates based on spherical models. The lower luminosity newly
derived from our MIDI observations and two-dimensional modeling brings the
location of WOH G64 on the H-R diagram in much better agreement with
theoretical evolutionary tracks for a 25 Msun star. We also identify the H2O
absorption features at 2.7 and 6 micron in the spectra obtained with the
Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 2.7 micron
feature originates in the photosphere and/or the extended molecular layers,

morphology of this galaxy is dominated by eight star-forming clumps in optical

that this system is a group merger of several initially separate
proto-galaxies. We performed H_alpha integral field spectroscopy of this system
using SINFONI on VLT UT4. These observations reveal a large-scale velocity
gradient throughout the system, but with large local kinematic disturbances.
Using a numerical model of gas-rich disk fragmentation, we find that clump
interactions and migration can account for the observed disturbed rotation. On
the other hand, the global rotation would not be expected for a multiply
merging system. We further find that this system follows the stellar mass vs.
metallicity, star formation rate and size relations expected for a disk at this
redshift, and exhibits a disk-like radial metallicity gradient, so that the
scenario of internal disk fragmentation is the most likely one. A red and
metallic central concentration appears to be a bulge in this proto-spiral
clumpy galaxy. A chain galaxy at redshift 2.07 in the same field also shows
disk-like rotation. Such systems are likely progenitors of the present-day
bright spiral galaxies, forming their exponential disks through clump migration
and disruption and fueling their bulges. Our present results show that
disturbed morphologies and kinematics are not necessarily signs of galaxy
mergers and interactions, and can instead result from the internal evolution of
primordial disks.

clustered SNe explosions cause the formation of hot superbubbles that drive
either fountains or galactic winds above the galactic disk, depending on the
amount and concentration of energy that is injected by the SNe. In a galactic
fountain, the ejected gas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and
falls back onto the disk. From 3D nonequilibrium radiative cooling
hydrodynamical simulations of these fountains, we find that they may reach
altitudes up to about 5 kpc in the halo and thus allow for the formation of the
so called intermediate-velocity-clouds (IVCs) which are often observed in the
halos of disk galaxies. The high-velocity-clouds that are also observed but at
higher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their
production. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas
from the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are
carried to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum
losses to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls back to smaller
radii and is not largely spread over the galactic disk. Instead, the SNe ejecta
fall nearby the region where the fountain was produced, a result which is
consistent with recent chemical models of the galaxy. The fall back material
leads to the formation of new generations of molecular clouds and to supersonic
turbulence feedback in the disk.

  ""Congruence topologies on the mapping class group""",,,,"math.AG math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let ${\cal M}_{g,n}$ and ${\cal H}_{g,n}$, for $2g-2+n>0$, be, respectively,
the moduli stack of $n$-pointed, genus $g$ smooth curves and its closed
substack consisting of hyperelliptic curves. Their topological fundamental
groups can be identified, respectively, with $\Gamma_{g,n}$ and $H_{g,n}$, the
so called Teichm{\""u}ller modular group and hyperelliptic modular group. A
choice of base point on ${\cal H}_{g,n}$ defines a monomorphism
$H_{g,n}\hookrightarrow\Gamma_{g,n}$.
  Let $S_{g,n}$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$ with $n$ points
removed. The Teichm\""uller group $\Gamma_{g,n}$ is the group of isotopy classes
of diffeomorphisms of the surface $S_{g,n}$ which preserve the orientation and
a given order of the punctures. As a subgroup of $\Gamma_{g,n}$, the
hyperelliptic modular group then admits a natural faithful representation
$H_{g,n}\hookrightarrow\operatorname{Out}(\pi_1(S_{g,n}))$.
  The congruence subgroup problem for $H_{g,n}$ asks whether, for any given
finite index subgroup $H^\lambda$ of $H_{g,n}$, there exists a finite index
characteristic subgroup $K$ of $\pi_1(S_{g,n})$ such that the kernel of the
induced representation $H_{g,n}\to\operatorname{Out}(\pi_1(S_{g,n})/K)$ is
contained in $H^\lambda$. The main result of the paper is an affirmative answer
to this question for $n\geq 1$.

subpulse modulation at an observing wavelength of (when achievable) both 21 and
92 cm using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. For 57 pulsars drifting
subpulses are discovered for the first time and are confirmed for many others.
This leads to the conclusion that it could well be that the drifting subpulse
mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although
for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. It appears that the
youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become
more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. Drifting
subpulses are in general found at both frequencies and the measured values of
P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, showing the broadband nature
of this phenomenon. Also the modulation indices measured at the two frequencies
are clearly correlated, although at 92 cm they are on average possibly higher.
The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with
the picture in which the radio emission is composed out of a drifting subpulse
signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high
observing frequencies. There is no obvious correlation found between P3 and the
pulsar age (or any other pulsar parameter) contrary to reports in the past.

intracluster medium (ICM) for 192 well-observed galaxy clusters selected from
the Chandra Data Archive. If the hot ICM is nearly isothermal in the projected
region of interest, the X-ray temperature inferred from a broad-band (0.7-7.0
keV) spectrum should be identical to the X-ray temperature inferred from a
hard-band (2.0-7.0 keV) spectrum. However, if unresolved cool lumps of gas are
contributing soft X-ray emission, the temperature of a best-fit
single-component thermal model will be cooler for the broad-band spectrum than
for the hard-band spectrum. Using this difference as a diagnostic, the ratio of
best-fitting hard-band and broad-band temperatures may indicate the presence of
cooler gas even when the X-ray spectrum itself may not have sufficient
signal-to-noise to resolve multiple temperature components. To test this
possible diagnostic, we extract X-ray spectra from core-excised annular regions
for each cluster in our archival sample. We compare the X-ray temperatures
inferred from single-temperature fits when the energy range of the fit is
0.7-7.0 keV (broad) and when the energy range is 2.0/(1+z)-7.0 keV (hard). We
find that the hard-band temperature is significantly higher, on average, than
the broad-band temperature. Upon further exploration, we find this temperature
ratio is enhanced preferentially for clusters which are known merging systems.
In addition, cool-core clusters tend to have best-fit hard-band temperatures
that are in closer agreement with their best-fit broad-band temperatures. We
show, using simulated spectra, that this diagnostic is sensitive to secondary
cool components (TX = 0.5-3.0 keV) with emission measures >10-30% of the
primary hot component.

Y1-xCaxVO3 (0<x<0.1) is investigated by measurements of the optical
conductivity and Raman scattering spectra in comparison with the
larger-bandwidth system La1-xSrxVO3. We also take into consideration the
magnitude of the GdFeO3-type orthorhombic lattice distortion, which is large
and small in Y1-xCaxVO3 and La1-xSrxVO3, respectively, and discuss its effect
on the evolution of charge dynamics. The optical conductivity spectra show that
the doped hole is well localized and forms the small polaron like state. The
hole dynamics in Y1-xCaxVO3 is nearly isotropic up to the doping level of the
orbital order-disorder transition, while that in La1-xSrxVO3 is anisotropic in
the lightly doped region due to the one-dimensional orbital exchange
interaction. The possible origin of the difference in the hole dynamics is
discussed in terms of the local lattice distortion, which is induced by the
formation of the small polaron like state and becomes more significant for the
reduced one-electron bandwidth. In addition, the optical Mott-gap excitation in
the nominally C-type spin and $G$-type orbital ordered phase is distinct from
that for La1-xSrxVO3 in its intensity and spectral shape. This suggests that
the orthorhombic lattice distortion enhances the modification of the spin and
orbital ordering from the pure C-type and G-type, respectively. The systematic
study of Raman scattering spectra has shown that the dynamic G-type spin and
C-type orbital correlation subsists at low temperatures in the doping induced
phase of the nominally C-type SO and G-type OO.

when the variables have a natural ordering. Using the Cholesky decomposition of
the inverse, we impose a banded structure on the Cholesky factor, and select
the bandwidth adaptively for each row of the Cholesky factor, using a novel
penalty we call nested Lasso. This structure has more flexibility than regular
banding, but, unlike regular Lasso applied to the entries of the Cholesky
factor, results in a sparse estimator for the inverse of the covariance matrix.
An iterative algorithm for solving the optimization problem is developed. The
estimator is compared to a number of other covariance estimators and is shown
to do best, both in simulations and on a real data example. Simulations show
that the margin by which the estimator outperforms its competitors tends to
increase with dimension.

item only of respondents who give a certain answer to an opening question, or
do not ask the item at all. The first option is most informative but also most
costly. The use of skip sequencing reduces respondent burden and the cost of
interviewing, but may spread data quality problems across survey items, thereby
reducing informativeness. The last option has no cost but is completely
uninformative about the item of interest. We show how the planner may choose

performs continuous model selection. Lasso penalized regression is capable of
handling linear regression problems where the number of predictors far exceeds
the number of cases. This paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for
estimating regression coefficients with a lasso penalty. The previously known
$\ell_2$ algorithm is based on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new $\ell_1$
algorithm is based on greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's algorithm for
ordinary $\ell_1$ regression. Each algorithm relies on a tuning constant that
can be chosen by cross-validation. In some regression problems it is natural to
group parameters and penalize parameters group by group rather than separately.
If the group penalty is proportional to the Euclidean norm of the parameters of
the group, then it is possible to majorize the norm and reduce parameter
estimation to $\ell_2$ regression with a lasso penalty. Thus, the existing
algorithm can be extended to novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed
is tested via either simulated or real data or both. The Appendix proves that a
greedy form of the $\ell_2$ algorithm converges to the minimum value of the
objective function.

individuals; most of these models study opinion propagation as the interaction
between nodes/agents in a social network. Opinion formation is a complex
process and a realistic model should also take into account the important
feedbacks that the opinions of the agents have on the structure of the social
networks and on the characteristics of the opinion dynamics. In this paper we
will show that associating to different agents different kinds of
interconnections and different interacting behaviours can lead to interesting
scenarios, like the coexistence of several opinion clusters, namely pluralism.
In our model agents have opinions uniformly and continuously distributed
between two extremes. The social network is formed through a social aggregation
mechanism including the segregation process of the extremists that results in
many real communities. We show how this process affects the opinion dynamics in
the whole society. In the opinion evolution we consider the different
predisposition of single individuals to interact and to exchange opinion with
each other; we associate to each individual a different tolerance threshold,
depending on its own opinion: extremists are less willing to interact with
individuals with strongly different opinions and to change significantly their
ideas. A general result is obtained: when there is no interaction restriction,
the opinion always converges to uniformity, but the same is happening whenever
a strong segregation process of the extremists occurs. Only when extremists are
forming clusters but these clusters keep interacting with the rest of the
society, the survival of a wide opinion range is guaranteed.

maximum false-negative error exponent subject to a guaranteed false-positive

asymptotically optimum embedding and detection rules under the assumption that
the detector relies solely on second order joint empirical statistics of the
received signal and the watermark. In the case of a Gaussian host signal and a
Gaussian attack, however, closed-form expressions for the optimum embedding
strategy and the false-negative error exponent were not obtained in that work.
In this paper, we derive such expressions, again, under the universality
assumption that neither the host variance nor the attack power are known to
either the embedder or the detector. The optimum embedding rule turns out to be
very simple and with an intuitively-appealing geometrical interpretation. The
improvement with respect to existing sub-optimum schemes is demonstrated by
displaying the optimum false-negative error exponent as a function of the

has shifted assessments of differential expression in DNA microarray studies
from single genes to groups of genes with shared biological function. This
paper takes a critical look at existing methods for assessing the differential
expression of a group of genes (functional category), and provides some
suggestions for improved performance. We begin by presenting a general
framework, in which the set of genes in a functional category is compared to
the complementary set of genes on the array. The framework includes tests for
overrepresentation of a category within a list of significant genes, and
methods that consider continuous measures of differential expression. Existing
tests are divided into two classes. Class 1 tests assume gene-specific measures
of differential expression are independent, despite overwhelming evidence of
positive correlation. Analytic and simulated results are presented that
demonstrate Class 1 tests are strongly anti-conservative in practice. Class 2
tests account for gene correlation, typically through array permutation that by
construction has proper Type I error control for the induced null. However,
both Class 1 and Class 2 tests use a null hypothesis that all genes have the
same degree of differential expression. We introduce a more sensible and
general (Class 3) null under which the profile of differential expression is
the same within the category and complement. Under this broader null, Class 2
tests are shown to be conservative. We propose standard bootstrap methods for
testing against the Class 3 null and demonstrate they provide valid Type I
error control and more power than array permutation in simulated datasets and
real microarray experiments.

render it self-consistent and rationally understandable, we find that the best
approach is to adopt E. Cartan's way for discovering spinors; that is to start
from 3-dimensional null vectors and then show how they may be represented by
two dimensional spinors. We have now only to go along this path, however in the
opposite direction; with these spinors (which are pure) construct bilinearly
null vectors: and we find that they naturally generate null vectors of
Minkowski momentum space, where Cartan equations defining pure spinors are
identical to all equations of motion for massless systems: both the quantum
(Weyl's) and the classical ones (Maxwell's), are determined by them. We have
then the possibility of a new, purely mathematical, determination of h: the
Planck's constant, and thus the possible mathematical starting point for the
representation of quantum mechanics.

the extent of noncompliance with social security regulations. The survey was

series of sensitive questions about regulatory noncompliance. Due to the
sensitive nature of the questions the randomized response design was used.
Although randomized response protects the privacy of the respondent, it is
unlikely that all respondents followed the design. In this paper we introduce a
model that allows for respondents displaying self-protective response behavior
by consistently giving the nonincriminating response, irrespective of the
outcome of the randomizing device. The dependent variable denoting the total
number of incriminating responses is assumed to be generated by the application
of randomized response to a latent Poisson variable denoting the true number of
rule violations. Since self-protective responses result in an excess of
observed zeros in relation to the Poisson randomized response distribution,
these are modeled as observed zero-inflation. The model includes predictors of
the Poisson parameters, as well as predictors of the probability of
self-protective response behavior.

to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e. the allocated shift pattern
of each nurse), and then mimic a natural evolutionary process on these
components to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all
components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for
them to remain there. This demonstration employs a dynamic evaluation function
which evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final
objective. Two perturbation steps are then applied: the first perturbation
eliminates a number of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the
current schedule; the second perturbation may also throw out, with a low level
of probability, some worthy components. The eliminated components are
replenished with new ones using a set of constructive heuristics using local
optimality criteria. Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.

single-crystal growth, where the dominant growth direction is aligned

controlled teleportation of an arbitrary N-particle quantum state using N-1
identical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and one (M+2)-particle
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state together as quantum channel. Based on which a
2-party controlled teleportation of an arbitrary 3-particle state is tested

method for studying biological systems. A frequent goal in such studies is to
unravel the regulatory relationships between genes. During the last few years,
regression models have been proposed for the de novo discovery of cis-acting
regulatory sequences using gene expression data. However, when applied to
multi-sample experiments, existing regression based methods model each
individual sample separately. To better capture the dynamic relationships in
multi-sample microarray experiments, we propose a flexible method for the joint
modeling of promoter sequence and multivariate expression data. In higher order
eukaryotic genomes expression regulation usually involves combinatorial
interaction between several transcription factors. Experiments have shown that
spacing between transcription factor binding sites can significantly affect
their strength in activating gene expression. We propose an adaptive model
building procedure to capture such spacing dependent cis-acting regulatory
modules. We apply our methods to the analysis of microarray time-course
experiments in yeast and in Arabidopsis. These experiments exhibit very
different dynamic temporal relationships. For both data sets, we have found all
of the well-known cis-acting regulatory elements in the related context, as
well as being able to predict novel elements.

simulation is generally recognised as one of the best design support

process. A simulation model consists of a set of rules that define how a system
changes over time, given its current state. Unlike analytical models, a
simulation model is not solved but is run and the changes of system states can
be observed at any point in time. This provides an insight into system dynamics
rather than just predicting the output of a system based on specific inputs.
Simulation is not a decision making tool but a decision support tool, allowing
better informed decisions to be made. Due to the complexity of the real world,
a simulation model can only be an approximation of the target system. The
essence of the art of simulation modelling is abstraction and simplification.
Only those characteristics that are important for the study and analysis of the

time-dependent and turbulent. This paper presents the minimal MHD spherical
accretion model that separately deals with turbulence. Treatment of turbulence
is based on simulations of several regimes of collisional MHD. The effects of
freezing-in amplification, dissipation, dynamo action, isotropization, and
constant magnetic helicity are self-consistently included. The assumptions of
equipartition and magnetic field isotropy are released. Correct dynamics of
magnetized flow is calculated. Diffusion, convection, and radiation are not
accounted for. Two different types of Radiatively Inefficient accretion flows
are found: a transonic non-rotating flow (I), a flow with effective transport
of angular momentum outward (II). Non-rotating flow has an accretion rate
several times smaller than Bondi rate, because turbulence inhibits accretion.
Flow with angular momentum transport has accretion rate about 10-100 times
smaller than Bondi rate. The effects of highly helical turbulence, states of
outer magnetization, and different equations of state are discussed. The flows
were found to be convectively stable on average, despite gas entropy increases
inward. The proposed model has a small number of free parameters and the
following attractive property. Inner density in the non-rotating magnetized
flow was found to be several times lower than density in a non-magnetized
accretion. Still several times lower density is required to explain the
observed low IR luminosity and low Faraday rotation measure of accretion onto

molecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with
the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action
from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical
messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune
system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and
destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds
to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can
remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information
processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in
recent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by
immunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts
from the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world
science and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the
immune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems
methods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for
Artificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one

energy distribution (SED) of 5 galaxies at 0.6<z<0.9 and 1 galaxy at z=1.7.
These 6 galaxies, located in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey field
(GOODS-N), are star forming since they present strong 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 um
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) lines in their Spitzer IRS mid-infrared
spectra. We use a library of templates computed with PEGASE.2 to fit their
multiwavelength photometry and derive their stellar continuum. Subtraction of
the stellar continuum enables us to detect in 5 galaxies a significant excess
in the IRAC band pass where the 3.3 um PAH is expected. We then assess if the
physical origin of the IRAC excess is due to an obscured active galactic
nucleus (AGN) or warm dust emission. For one galaxy evidence of an obscured AGN
is found, while the remaining four do not exhibit any significant AGN activity.
Possible contamination by warm dust continuum of unknown origin as found in the
Galactic diffuse emission is discussed. The properties of such a continuum
would have to be different from the local Universe to explain the measured IRAC
excess, but we cannot definitively rule out this possibility until its origin
is understood. Assuming that the IRAC excess is dominated by the 3.3 um PAH
feature, we find good agreement with the observed 11.3 um PAH line flux arising
from the same C-H bending and stretching modes, consistent with model
expectations. Finally, the IRAC excess appears to be correlated with the
star-formation rate in the galaxies. Hence it could provide a powerful
diagnostic for measuring dusty star formation in z>3 galaxies once the
mid-infrared spectroscopic capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope
become available.

surrogate definition under the principal stratification framework proposed by
Frangakis and Rubin [Biometrics 58 (2002) 21--29] and adapted by Gilbert and
Hudgens (2006), we introduce estimands that measure the value of an immune

vaccine is not measured in placebo recipients. We formulate the problem as a
Cox model with missing covariates, and employ novel trial designs for

The first design utilizes information from baseline predictors of the immune
response, and bridges their relationship in the vaccine recipients to the
placebo recipients. The second design provides a validation set for the
unmeasured immune responses of uninfected placebo recipients by immunizing them
with the study vaccine after trial closeout. A maximum estimated likelihood

investigated both analytically and numerically for both zero and nonzero baryon

a class of actions with nonzero chemical potential. All such actions are shown
to violate chiral invariance. While the parameter M can be shown to be
irrelevant in the continuum limit, as expected, it is shown numerically that
the continuum limit can be reached with relatively coarser lattices for certain
ranges of M. Numerical limitations of the existing method of introduction of
chemical potential are demonstrated. Finally we also show that the energy

Aviram and Ratner in 1974 was the starting point of the now vibrant field of

of molecular junctions has been reported at the experimental level. In this
contribution, we present a theoretical comparison of three different types of
unimolecular rectifiers: i) systems where the donor- and acceptor-part of the
molecules are taken from charge-transfer salt components; ii) zwitterionic
systems; and iii) Tour wires with nitro substituents. We conduct an analysis of
the rectification mechanism in these three different types of asymmetric
molecules on the basis of parameterized quantum-chemical models as well as with
a full non-equilibrium Greens function / density functional theory (NEGF-DFT)
treatment of the current/voltage characteristics of the respective
metal/molecule/metal junctions. We put a particular emphasis on the prediction
of rectification ratios (RR), which are crucial for the assessment of the
technological usefulness of single molecule junctions as diodes. We also
compare our results with values reported in the literature for other types of
molecular rectification, where the essential asymmetry is not induced by the
structure of the molecule alone but either by a difference in the electronic
coupling of the molecule to the two electrodes or by attaching alkyl chains of
different lengths to the central molecular moiety.

available to identify the genes with differential expression levels over time,
there is a lack of methods that can incorporate the pathway information in
identifying the pathways being modified/activated during a biological process.
In this paper we develop a hidden spatial-temporal Markov random field
(hstMRF)-based method for identifying genes and subnetworks that are related to
biological processes, where the dependency of the differential expression
patterns of genes on the networks are modeled over time and over the network of
pathways. Simulation studies indicated that the method is quite effective in
identifying genes and modified subnetworks and has higher sensitivity than the
commonly used procedures that do not use the pathway structure or time
dependency information, with similar false discovery rates. Application to a
microarray gene expression study of systemic inflammation in humans identified
a core set of genes on the KEGG pathways that show clear differential
expression patterns over time. In addition, the method confirmed that the

the typical table and prove that for such margins the algorithm has
quasi-polynomial N^{O(ln N)} complexity, where N=r_1+...+r_m=c_1+...+c_n.
Various classes of margins are smooth, e.g., when m=O(n), n=O(m) and the ratios
between the largest and the smallest row sums as well as between the largest
and the smallest column sums are strictly smaller than the golden ratio
(1+sqrt{5})/2 = 1.618. The algorithm builds on Monte Carlo integration and
sampling algorithms for log-concave densities, the matrix scaling algorithm,
the permanent approximation algorithm, and an integral representation for the

interesting new physics model which does not suffer strong constraints from
electroweak precision data. One of the important features of the LHT model is
the existence of new source of FC interactions between the SM fermions and the
mirror fermions. These FC interactions can make significant loop-level
contributions to the couplings $tcV$, and furthermore enhance the cross
sections of the FC single-top quark production processes. In this paper, we
study some FC single-top quark production processes, $pp\to t\bar{c}$ and
$pp\to tV$, at the LHC in the LHT model. We find that the cross sections of
these processes are strongly depended on the mirror quark masses. The processes
$pp\to t\bar{c}$ and $pp\to tg$ have large cross sections with heavy mirror
quarks. The observation of these FC processes at the LHC is certainly the clue
of new physics, and further precise measurements of the cross scetions can
provide useful information about the free parameters in the LHT model,
specially about the mirror quark masses.

Landau-Levich-Derjaguin (LLD) film is observed, whose thickness scales like
$U^{2/3}$. The thick film is distinguished from the LLD film by a dip in its

for the existence of stationary film solutions as well as the film profiles,
and find excellent agreement with experiment.

integration I(d). A class of regression models where cointegration works was
identified by Granger and yields the ergodic behavior required for equilibrium
expectations in standard economics. Detrended finance market returns are
martingales, and martingales do not satisfy regression equations. We extend the
standard discussion to discover the class of detrended processes beyond
standard regression models that satisfy integration I(d). In the language of
econometrics, the models of interest are unit root models, meaning martingales.
Typical martingales do not have stationary increments, and those that do
generally do not admit ergodicity. Our analysis leads us to comment on the lack
of equilibrium observed earlier between FX rates and relative price levels.

analysis of acoustic oscillation modes. Gravity modes are necessary to
understand the structure and dynamics of the deepest layers of the Sun. Through
recent progresses on the observation of these modes -- both individually and
collectively -- new information could be available to contribute to inferring
the rotation profile down inside the nuclear burning core. To see the
sensitivity of gravity modes to the rotation of the solar core. We analyze the
influence of adding the splitting of one and several g modes to the data sets
used in helioseismic numerical inversions. We look for constraints on the
uncertainties required in the observations in order to improve the derived core
rotation profile. We compute forward problems obtaining three artificial sets
of splittings derived for three rotation profiles: a rigid profile taken as a
reference, a step-like and a smoother profiles with higher rates in the core.
We compute inversions based on Regularized Least-Squares methodology (RLS) for
both artificial data with real error bars and real data. Several sets of data
are used: first we invert only p modes, then we add one and several g modes to
which different values of observational uncertainties (75 and 7.5 nHz) are
attributed. For the real data, we include g-mode candidate, l=2, n=-3 with
several splittings and associated uncertainties. We show that the introduction
of one g mode in artificial data improves the rate in the solar core and give
an idea on the tendency of the rotation profile. The addition of more g modes
gives more accuracy to the inversions and stabilize them. The inversion of real
data with the g-mode candidate gives a rotation profile that remains unchanged
down to 0.2 R, whatever value of splitting we attribute to the g mode.
