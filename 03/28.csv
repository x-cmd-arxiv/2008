scale Planck mass is completely determined by the breaking of the scaling
symmetry in the field theory sector. The Higgs-like field which breaks the
symmetry with a GUT-scale vacuum expectation value has non-minimal couplings to
the curvature, induced by the gravitational couplings of the other light fields
in the theory, so that its expectation value controls the gravitational
strength. This field can drive inflation, and give a low energy universe in
very good agreement with the cosmological observations. The low energy dynamics
of the Standard Model cannot be unitarized by the Higgsflaton, which decouples
from the low energy theory, both because it picks up a large mass and because
its direct couplings to the low energy modes are weakened. Instead, the short
distance behavior of the Standard Model may be regulated by the dynamics of
other light degrees of freedom, such as in Higgsless models.

examples of such new physics: pair production of a fermionic top partner (a
$T'$ in Little Higgs models for example) and of a scalar top partner (a
$\tilde{t}$ in SUSY). With a commonly-adopted discrete symmetry under which non
Standard Model particles are odd, the top partner is assumed to decay
predominantly to a top quark plus a massive neutral stable particle $A^0$. We
focus on the case in which one of the top quarks decays leptonically and the
other decays hadronically, $pp \to {\tt} A^0A^0 X \to bj_1j_2 \bar b\ell^-
\bar\nu A^0A^0 X + c.c.$, where the $A^0$s escape detection. We identify a key
parameter for the signal observation: the mass splitting between the top
partner and the missing particle. We reconstruct a transverse mass for the
lepton-missing transverse energy system to separate the real $W$ background
from the signal and propose a definition for the reconstructed top quark mass
that allows it to take unphysical values as an indication of new physics. We
perform a scan over the two masses to map out the discovery reach at the LHC in

the disks around hot stars. Observational evidence supports the idea that these
disks are Keplerian (rotationally supported) gaseous disks. A popular scenario
in the literature, which naturally leads to the formation of Keplerian disks,
is the viscous decretion model. According to this scenario, the disks are
hydrostatically supported in the vertical direction, while the radial structure
is governed by the viscous transport. This suggests that the temperature is one
primary factor that governs the disk density structure. In a previous study we
demonstrated, using 3-D NLTE Monte Carlo simulations, that viscous keplerian
disks can be highly non-isothermal. In this paper we build upon our previous
work and solve the full problem of the steady-state non-isothermal viscous
diffusion and vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the
self-consistent solution departs significantly from the analytic isothermal
density, with potentially large effects on the emergent spectrum. This implies
that non-isothermal disk models must be used for a detailed modeling of Be star
disks.

metallicity properties. In particular, we show that the metallicity of
absorbers is a bivariate function of the HI column density (NHI) and the MgII
equivalent width (Wr(2796)). Thus, a selection upon Wr(2796) is not equivalent
to a HI selection for intervening absorbers. A direct consequence for damped
absorbers with NHI>20.3 from the bivariate metallicity distribution is that any
correlation between the metallicity [X/H] and velocity width (or Wr(2796))
arises from the HI cut and therefore can not be interpreted as a signature of
the mass-metallicity relation akin to normal field galaxies. Thus DLA samples
are intrinsically heterogeneous. On the other hand, a sample of MgII-selected
absorbers, which are statistically dominated by lowest NHI systems (sub-DLAs),
are found to have a more uniform metallicity distribution. We postulate that
the bivariate metallicity distribution can be explained by two different
physical origins of absorbers, namely sight-lines through the ISM of small
galaxies and sight-lines through out-flowing material.
  Several published results follow from this bivariate [X/H] distribution such
as (a) the two classes of DLAs, reported by Wolfe et al., and (b) the constant
dust-to-gas ratio for MgII-absorbers.

Euclidean dimensions. The goals of this paper are to characterize the behavior
of the pair correlation function (pcf) in various density regimes and to
understand the phase properties of the Gaussian core model (GCM) as
parametrized by dimension d. To this end, we explore the fluid and crystalline
solid phases. For the dilute regime of the fluid phase, a cluster expansion of
the pcf in reciprocal temperature is presented, the coefficients of which may
be evaluated analytically due to the nature of the Gaussian potential. We
present preliminary results concerning the convergence properties of this
expansion. The analytical cluster expansion is related to numerical
approximations for the pcf in the dense fluid regime by utilizing hypernetted
chain, Percus-Yevick, and mean-field closures to the Ornstein-Zernike equation.
Based on the results of these comparisons, we provide evidence in support of a
decorrelation principle for the GCM in high Euclidean dimensions. In the solid
phase, we consider the behavior of the freezing temperature in the limit of
zero density and show that it approaches zero itself in this limit for any d
via a collective coordinate argument. Duality relations with respect to the
energies of a lattice and its dual are then discussed, and these relations aid
in the Maxwell double-tangent construction of phase coexistence regions between
dual lattices based on lattice summation energies. The results from this
analysis are used to draw conclusions about the ground-state structures of the
GCM for a given dimension.

differential equations that generalizes the KdV hierarchy. A linear combination
of Schur functions is a solution to the KP hierarchy if and only if its
coefficients satisfy the Plucker relations from geometry. We give a solution to
the Plucker relations involving products of variables marking contents for a
partition, and thus give a new proof of a content product solution to the KP
hierarchy, previously given by Orlov and Shcherbin. In our main result, we
specialize this content product solution to prove that the generating series
for a general class of transitive ordered factorizations in the symmetric group
satisfies the KP hierarchy. These factorizations appear in geometry as
encodings of branched covers, and thus by specializing our transitive
factorization result, we are able to prove that the generating series for two
classes of branched covers satisfies the KP hierarchy. For the first of these,
the double Hurwitz series, this result has been previously given by Okounkov.
The second of these, that we call the m-hypermap series, contains the double
Hurwitz series polynomially, as the leading coefficient in m. The m-hypermap
series also specializes further, first to the series for hypermaps and then to
the series for maps, both in an orientable surface. For the latter series, we
apply one of the KP equations to obtain a new and remarkably simple recurrence
for triangulations in a surface of given genus, with a given number of faces.
This recurrence leads to explicit asymptotics for the number of triangulations
with given genus and number of faces, in recent work by Bender, Gao and
Richmond.

temperature of up to $2\times10^{-11}$, and leads to a frequency-dependent
change in the power spectrum of the order $10^{-7}$ at 30 GHz. With a change of
the order $10^{-10}$ in the power spectrum, our result for the bound-free
process of \HM is significantly below a previous suggestion. \HeHII efficiently
scatters CMB photons and smears out primordial fluctuations, leading to a
change in the power spectrum of the order $10^{-8}$. Improvements in the
accuracy of future CMB experiments may thus help to constrain and finally
detect these interesting signals from the dark ages of the universe.

the matrix of dynamics as well as in the control, output and input-output

complex space. The various properties which are investigated are
controllability, observability, output controllability and existence of minimal
state-space realizations together with the associate existence or not of
associate decoupling, transmission and invariant zeros. All the matrices of
parameters including the nominal and the disturbed ones which parameterize the
dynamic system may be real or complex. The radii of the multi- parametrical

applied to systems subject to a finite number of point internal delays and
parametrical multi perturbations by comparing the state- space descriptions of
such systems with the general descriptions previously investigated. In

assimilated to the contributions of a set of varying parameters in a domain for

Bogoliubov-type excitations in the pseudogap phase in the anti-nodal region,
where a robust pseudogap remains well above Tc. This important experimental
result has been theoretically predicted by us almost 6 years ago on a basis of
the phenomenological boson fermion model. An earlier theoretical prediction on
the basis of this model was that of a pseudogap in the electron DOS, setting in
at some temperature T* and evolving into the superconducting gap upon
approaching Tc. A natural logical pursuit of this early work was to show that,
in order to have a superconducting state evolved out of a pseudogap state, the
diamagnetic bosonic pair fluctuations (characterizing the pseudogap phase) have
to be propagating modes, which are phase correlated over finite distances above
Tc. If so, then the pseudogap feature has to be reflected in characteristic
features of the single particle excitations, showing remnants of the Bogoliubov
modes inherent in the superconducting phase. Such Bogoliubov modes result from
dynamical feedback effects between single electron excitations and dynamical
local pairing fluctuations. We briefly recollect here our theoretical results
and confront them with the recent experimental findings.

spectrum of AdS/CFT has been deepened by integrability-based approaches. We
begin with a comprehensive review of the integrability of the gauge theory
spin-chain and that of the string sigma model. In the light of the AdS/CFT
duality, they should be just two ways of describing the same underlying
integrability, and it is believed that the unified integrability can be
characterised by a set of Bethe ansatz equations which is valid for all values
of the 't Hooft coupling. By studying the asymptotic spectrum of the AdS/CFT in
the infinite spin/R-charge limit, we first identify the corresponding solitonic
counterparts in the context of the AdS/CFT, which are the so-called dyonic
giant magnons and the SYM magnon boundstates. Then we show that the S-matrix
computed directly from the string solitons scattering precisely reproduces the
prediction from the conjecture. We further perform an analyticity test by
studying the singularities of the conjectured magnon boundstate S-matrix and
checking the physicality conditions. These tests give strong positive supports
for the integrability of large-N AdS/CFT as well as the specific form of the
conjectured Bethe ansatz equations. Concerning the string theory integrability,
we also provide a detailed study of certain classical string solutions on AdS_5
x S^5. These are constructed in such a way they correspond to generic soliton
solutions of (Complex) sine/sinh-Gordon equations via the so-called Pohlmeyer
reduction procedure. Furthermore, we describe them in terms of
algebro-geometric data as finite-gap solutions, giving a complete map of the
elliptic string solutions.

potentially provide us with a dynamical explanation of the cosmological
constant problem. In this paper, however, we show by means of a semiclassical
analysis that the trace anomaly does not affect the cosmological constant. We
construct the effective action of the conformal anomaly for flat FLRW
spacetimes consisting of local quadratic geometric curvature invariants.
Counterterms are thus expected to influence the numerical value of the
coefficients in the trace anomaly and we must therefore allow these parameters
to vary. We calculate the evolution of the Hubble parameter in quasi de Sitter
spacetime, where we restrict our Hubble parameter to vary slowly in time, and
in FLRW spacetimes. We show dynamically that a Universe consisting of matter
with a constant equation of state, a cosmological constant and the quantum
trace anomaly evolves either to the classical de Sitter attractor or to a
quantum trace anomaly driven one. When considering the trace anomaly truncated
to quasi de Sitter spacetime, we find a region in parameter space where the
quantum attractor destabilises. When considering the exact expression of the
trace anomaly, a stability analysis shows that whenever the trace anomaly
driven attractor is stable, the classical de Sitter attractor is unstable, and
vice versa. Semiclassically, the trace anomaly does not affect the classical
late time de Sitter attractor and hence it does not solve the cosmological
constant problem.

three hadron species are emitted from a common boosted source with boost
$\Delta y_{t0} \sim 0.6$. The quadrupole spectra have a L\'evy form similar to
the soft component of the single-particle spectrum, but with significantly
reduced ($\sim 0.7\times$) slope parameters $T$. Comparison of quadrupole
spectra with single-particle spectra suggests that the quadrupole component
comprises a small fraction ($< 5$%) of the total hadron yield, contradicting
the hydrodynamic picture of a thermalized, flowing bulk medium. The form of
$v_2(p_t)$ is, within a constant factor, the product of $p'_t$ ($p_t$ in the

approximately between galaxy properties, for example, galaxies lie between two
broad extremes of type, where ``late'' types tend to be smaller in size, have
lower circular velocities, younger stars, higher star formation rates, larger
disk to bulge ratios and lower Sersic indices than ``early types''. As in
previous studies the stellar component of disk galaxies is not as rotationally
supported as in observations. Bulges contain too much of the stellar mass,
although disks do have scale lengths compatible with observations. The addition
of black hole physics to the simulations does not appear to have an impact on
the angular momentum results, nor do we find that it is affected in an
identical simulation with significantly lower mass resolution. Despite this, we
can profitably use the rank order of either disk to total ratio, Sersic index,

density-morphology relation and morphology dependence of clustering. We find
that while at redshift z=0, the well known preponderance of early types in

the remnant as a whole, and for six individual sectors. The average expansion
parameter indicates that the remnant expands as $r \propto t^{0.5}$, but there
are significant differences in different parts of the remnant: the bright
northwestern part expands as $r \propto t^{0.35}$, whereas the rest of the
remnant's expansion shows an expansion $r \propto t^{0.6}$. The latter is
consistent with an explosion in which the outer part of the ejecta has a
negative power law slope for density ($\rho \propto v^{-n}$) of $n=7$, or with
an exponential density profile($\rho \propto \exp(-v/v_e)$). The expansion
parameter in the southern region, in conjunction with the shock radius,
indicate a rather low value (<5E50 erg) for the explosion energy of SN1604 for
a distance of 4 kpc. An higher explosion energy is consistent with the results,
if the distance is larger.
  The filament in the eastern part of the remnant, which is dominated by X-ray
synchrotron radiation seems to mark a region with a fast shock speed $r \propto
t^{0.7}$, corresponding to a shock velocity of v= 4200 km/s, for a distance to
SN1604 of 4 kpc. This is consistent with the idea that X-ray synchrotron
emission requires shock velocities in excess of ~2000 km/s.

based on optical and radio measurements, but disagree with previous X-ray
measurements based on ROSAT and Einstein observations.

following decades. Since then, the increasing ubiquity of Internet access and
the frequency with which people interact with it raise the possibility of using
the Web to better observe, understand, and monitor several aspects of human
social behavior. Web sites with large numbers of frequently returning users are
ideal for this task. If these sites belong to companies or universities, their
usage patterns can furnish information about the working habits of entire
populations. In this work, we analyze the properly anonymized logs detailing
the access history to Emory University's Web site. Emory is a medium size
university located in Atlanta, Georgia. We find interesting structure in the
activity patterns of the domain and study in a systematic way the main forces
behind the dynamics of the traffic. In particular, we show that both linear
preferential linking and priority based queuing are essential ingredients to
understand the way users navigate the Web.

convergence. The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is
that the majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going
on with other elements. At the same time, it is known that sequences that come
from real life sources, such as measurement and computation, do not allow, in a
general case, to test whether they converge or statistically converge in the
strict mathematical sense. To overcome these limitations, fuzzy convergence was
introduced earlier in the context of neoclassical analysis and fuzzy
statistical convergence is introduced and studied in this paper. We find
relations between fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and fuzzy
statistical convergence of its subsequences (Theorem 2.1), as well as between
fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and conventional convergence of its
subsequences (Theorem 2.2). It is demonstrated what operations with fuzzy
statistical limits are induced by operations on sequences (Theorem 2.3) and how
fuzzy statistical limits of different sequences influence one another (Theorem
2.4). In Section 3, relations between fuzzy statistical convergence and fuzzy
convergence of statistical characteristics, such as the mean (average) and
standard deviation, are studied (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2).

spiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a
$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable
methods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:
(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to
failure as a function of the rescaled sample size
$\theta_{\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled
sample size $\theta_{\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a
critical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best
method which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the

delivered to a soft x-ray beam with a photon energy of 1.5 keV using a

a thin sample, appropriate for the soft x-rays used, and continuously refreshes
the crystals so that radiation damage is not possible. The small size of the
crystals requires the use of lower energy photons for increased scattering
strength and increased spacing between powder rings. The powder patterns
obtained in this way, from abundant nano-crystals, could be used to provide low

galaxies from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). We derive ages and metallicities
using stellar population models. We also derive dynamical masses and dynamical
mass-to-light ratios by combining central velocity dispersions with global
photometry in B, R and K bands. Together, these data allow to reduce the
degeneracies between age, metallicity and star formation burst-strength that
have limited previous studies. We find old galaxies exhibit a mass-metallicity
relation with slope d[Fe/H]/dlogM = 0.25, while young galaxies show slopes
consistent with zero. When we account for the effects of the mass-metallicity
relation, we obtain a single, consistent relation between mass-to-light ratio
and mass for old galaxies in all passbands. As we have accounted for stellar
population effects, this relation must have a dynamical origin. However, we
demonstrate that any simple trend between mass-to-light-ratio and mass or
luminosity is inconsistent with the observations, and that a more complex
relationship must exist. We find the central regions of galaxies often exhibit
young stellar populations. However it is only in the lowest-mass galaxies
(~10^{10} M$_{\odot}$) that these populations are evident in the global
photometry. In higher-mass galaxies, young central populations have decreasing
influence on the global photometry, with there being no discernible impact in
galaxies more massive than ~2x10^{11} M$_{\odot}$. We conclude that the young
stellar populations detected in spectroscopic studies are generally centrally
concentrated, and that there is an upper limit on the mass of star-forming
events in massive galaxies. These results have ramifications for mass-to-light
ratios estimated from photometric observations.

the concept of minimal (critical) chain length lcr needed to trigger charge
transfer from chains to planes. The model proposed assumes that only a certain

equal to 4 (four oxygen atoms in a chain), or very close to it (3, or 5).
Calculated x dependences of doping, p(x), at constant (room) temperature and
for three different substitution levels b=0, 0.1, and 0.2, are found to be in
excellent agreement with available experimental data. These p(x) dependences
are combined with universal (parabolic) phase relation Tc(p) to obtain three
Tc(x) dependences that also remarkably correlate with those reported in
experiments. The results obtained indicate that in long chains (x=1) the
probability for a chain-hole to capture an electron (expressing hole ability to
become transferred) decreases with the concentration of 3d Cu electrons in CuO2

overhead, which is typically much lower than conventional routing protocols
such as AODV. However, the performance of geographic routing is impacted by
physical voids, and localization errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate
systems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to
localization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids. However,
VCS also faces virtual anomalies, causing their performance to trail geographic
routing. In existing VCS routing protocols, there is a lack of an effective
stateless and delivery guaranteed complementary routing algorithm that can be
used to traverse voids. Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or
blind searching when a void is encountered. In this paper, we propose a
spanning-path virtual coordinate system which can be used as a complete routing
algorithm or as the complementary algorithm to greedy forwarding that is
invoked when voids are encountered. With this approach, and for the first time,
we demonstrate a stateless and delivery guaranteed geometric routing algorithm
on VCS. When used in conjunction with our previously proposed aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS), it out-performs not only all geometric routing
protocols on VCS, but also geographic routing with accurate location

our discussion on the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the initial mass
function (IMF). A variety of initial energy states are examined in this paper,
ranging from clouds with PE = 0.1 KE to clouds with PE = 10 KE, and for both
isothermal and piece-wise polytropic equations of state (similar to that
suggested by Larson). It is found that arbitrary star formation efficiencies
are possible, with strongly unbound clouds yielding very low star formation
efficiencies. We suggest that the low star formation efficiency in the
Maddelena cloud may be a consequence of the relatively unbound state of its
internal structure. It is also found that competitive accretion results in the
observed IMF when the clouds have initial energy states of PE >= KE. We show
that under such conditions the shape of the IMF is independent of time in the
calculations. This demonstrates that the global accretion process can be
terminated at any stage in the cluster's evolution, while still yielding a
distribution of stellar masses that is consistent with the observed IMF. As the
clouds become progressively more unbound, competitive accretion is less
important and the protostellar mass function flattens. These results predict
that molecular clouds should be permeated with a distributed population of
stars that follow a flatter than Salpeter IMF.

the Yang-Baxter equation. Recently, Gateva-Ivanova and Van den Bergh and
Etingof, Schedler and Soloviev have shown a group theoretical interpretation of
involutive non-degenerate solutions. Namely, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between involutive non-degenerate solutions on finite sets and
groups of $I$-type. A group $\mathcal{G}$ of $I$-type is a group isomorphic to
a subgroup of the natural semidirect product of $Fa_n$, the free abelian group
of rank $n$, by $Sym_n$, the symmetric group on $n$ letters, so that the
projection onto $Fa_n$ is a bijective map. The projection of $\mathcal{G}$ onto
$Sym_n$ we call an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB group). This suggests the
following strategy to attack Drinfeld's problem for involutive non-degenerate
set theoretic solutions. First classify the IYB groups and second, for a given
IYB group $G$, classify the groups of $I$-type with $G$ as associated IYB
group. It is known that every IYB group is solvable. In this paper some results
supporting the converse of this property are obtained. More precisely, we show
that some classes of groups are IYB groups. We also give a non-obvious method
to construct infinitely many groups of $I$-type (and hence infinitely many
involutive non-degenerate set theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation)

which is specious. The authors opine; ``If the assassination fragments are
derived from three or more separate bullets, then a second assassin is likely,
as the additional bullet would not be attributable to the main suspect, Mr.
Oswald.'' This statement relating to the likelihood of a second assassin based
on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably false. The
available evidence indicates that Oswald fired three shots, one of which is
believed to have missed. However, on the off chance that all three shots hit
(even though there is absolutely no other supporting forensic evidence for such
a notion) those three shots alone in no way would indicate then that ``a second
assassin is likely.'' The authors' erroneous conclusion was achieved because
they have either been misled (which I personally believe is the case) or they
simply aren't familiar with the evidence.

the opportunity to respond to the letter to the editor from Mr. Fiorentino. Mr.
Fiorentino claims that our ``statement relating to the likelihood of a second
assassin based on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably
false.'' In response we would like to simply quote from page 327 of Gerald
Posner's book Case Closed, one of the most well known works supporting the
single assassin theory: ``If Connally was hit by another bullet, it had to be
fired from a second shooter, since the Warren Commission's own reconstructions
showed that Oswald could not have operated the bolt and refired in 1.4
seconds.'' Mr. Fiorentino also claims that the ``second fatal flaw is the use
of a rather uncomplicated formula based on Bayes Theorem.'' Let $E$ denote the
evidence and $T$ denote the theory that there were just two bullets (and hence
a single shooter). We used Bayes Theorem to hypothetically calculate $P(T|E)$
from $P(E|T)$ and the prior probability $P(T)$. In order to make $P(T|E)$ ten
times more likely than $P(\bar{T}|E)$, the ratio of the prior probabilities
[i.e., $P(T) / P(\bar{T})$] would have to be greater than 15. Thus, we again
conclude that this casts serious doubt on Dr. Guinn's conclusion that the
evidence supported just two bullets. Sadly, this is far from the first time
that probability has been misunderstood and/or misapplied in a case of public
interest. A notable British example is the Clark case. See Nobles and Schiff
(2005) for details. Finally, we welcome and, in fact, encourage members of the
scientific community to provide alternative analyses of the data.

studied on the basis of (publicly available) trajectory datasets recorded by a
vehicle equipped with an radar sensor. By means of a nonlinear optimization
procedure based on a genetic algorithm, we calibrate the Intelligent Driver
Model and the Velocity Difference Model by minimizing the deviations between
the observed driving dynamics and the simulated trajectory when following the
same leading vehicle. The reliability and robustness of the nonlinear fits are
assessed by applying different optimization criteria, i.e., different measures
for the deviations between two trajectories. The obtained errors are in the
range between~11% and~29% which is consistent with typical error ranges
obtained in previous studies. In addition, we found that the calibrated
parameter values of the Velocity Difference Model strongly depend on the
optimization criterion, while the Intelligent Driver Model is more robust in
this respect. By applying an explicit delay to the model input, we investigated
the influence of a reaction time. Remarkably, we found a negligible influence
of the reaction time indicating that drivers compensate for their reaction time
by anticipation. Furthermore, the parameter sets calibrated to a certain
trajectory are applied to the other trajectories allowing for model validation.
The results indicate that ``intra-driver variability'' rather than
``inter-driver variability'' accounts for a large part of the calibration
errors. The results are used to suggest some criteria towards a benchmarking of
car-following models.

16 eBCS and 7 REFLEX clusters, thus completing the radio information for the
whole sample. The typical sensitivity in our images is in the range 1$\sigma
\sim 35-100 \mu$Jy b$^{-1}$. We found a radio halo in A697, a diffuse
peripheral source of unclear nature in A781, a core--halo source in Z7160, a
candidate radio halo in A1682 and ``suspect'' central emission in Z2661.
Including the literature information, a total of 10 clusters in the sample host
a radio halo. A very important result of our work is that 25 out of the 34
clusters observed with the GMRT do not host extended central emission at the
sensitivity level of our observations, and for 20 of them firm upper limits to
the radio power of a giant radio halo were derived. The GMRT Radio Halo Survey
shows that radio halos are not common, and our findings on the fraction of
giant radio halos in massive clusters are consistent with the statistical
expectations based on the re--acceleration model. Our results favour primary to
secondary electron models.

embody best Mach's principle: in these gauges local inertial frames can be
determined instantaneously via the perturbed Einstein field equations from the
distributions of energy and momentum in the universe. The inertial frames are
identified by their `accelerations and rotations' with respect to the
cosmological frames associated with the `Machian gauges'. In closed spherical
universes, integral gauge conditions are imposed to eliminate motions generated
by the conformal Killing vectors. The meaning of Traschen's integral constraint
vectors is thus elucidated. For all three types of FRW universes the Machian

either case, it follows from work of the second author that there are only
finitely many configuration types of points, where our notion of configuration
type is a generalization of the notion of a representable combinatorial
geometry, also known as a representable simple matroid. (We say $p_1,...,p_r$

allows a typical form of Yukawa couplings, and the realistic neutrino masses

neutrinos transform non-trivially under the generalized Friedberg-Lee symmetry,
we can have the testable TeV scale see-saw mechanism. Second, we present two
models with the $SO(3)\times U(1)$ global flavour symmetry in the lepton
sector. After the flavour symmetry breaking, we can obtain the charged lepton
masses, and explain the neutrino masses and mixings via see-saw mechanism.
Interestingly, the complete neutrino mass matrices are similar to those of the
above models with generalized Friedberg-Lee symmetry. So the Friedberg-Lee
symmetry is the residual symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix after the

small external force $F$ is usually described by a linear displacement $h_G(t)
\sim V(F,T) t$ at large times, where the velocity vanishes according to the
creep formula as $V(F,T) \sim e^{-K(T)/F^{\mu}}$ for $F \to 0$. In this paper,
we question this picture on the specific example of the directed polymer in a
two dimensional random medium. We have recently shown (C. Monthus and T. Garel,
arxiv:0802.2502) that its dynamics for F=0 can be analyzed in terms of a strong
disorder renormalization procedure, where the distribution of renormalized
barriers flows towards some ""infinite disorder fixed point"". In the present
paper, we obtain that for small $F$, this ""infinite disorder fixed point""
becomes a ""strong disorder fixed point"" with an exponential distribution of
renormalized barriers. The corresponding distribution of trapping times then
only decays as a power-law $P(\tau) \sim 1/\tau^{1+\alpha}$, where the exponent
$\alpha(F,T)$ vanishes as $\alpha(F,T) \propto F^{\mu}$ as $F \to 0$. Our
conclusion is that in the small force region $\alpha(F,T)<1$, the divergence of
the averaged trapping time $\bar{\tau}=+\infty$ induces strong
non-self-averaging effects that invalidate the usual creep formula obtained by
replacing all trapping times by the typical value. We find instead that the
motion is only sub-linearly in time $h_G(t) \sim t^{\alpha(F,T)}$, i.e. the
asymptotic velocity vanishes V=0. This analysis is confirmed by numerical
simulations of a directed polymer with a metric constraint driven in a traps
landscape. We moreover obtain that the roughness exponent, which is governed by
the equilibrium value $\zeta_{eq}=2/3$ up to some large scale, becomes equal to
$\zeta=1$ at the largest scales.

carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 327 MHz and with the
Very Large Array at 4.9 and 8.5 GHz. We imaged the relic at these frequencies
and carried out a detailed spectral analysis, based on the integrated radio
spectrum between 235 MHz and 4.9 GHz, and on the spectral index image in the
frequency range 327-610 MHz. To this aim we used the new GMRT observations and
other proprietary as well as archival data. We also searched for a possible
shock front co-located with the relic on a short archival Chandra X-ray
observation of the cluster. The integrated spectrum of the relic is consistent
with a single power law; the spectral index image shows a clear trend of
steepening going from the outer portion of the relic toward the cluster centre.
We discuss the origin of the source in the light of the theoretical models for
the formation of cluster radio relics. Our results on the spectral properties
of the relic are consistent with acceleration of relativistic electrons by a
shock in the intracluster medium. This scenario is further supported by our
finding of an X-ray surface brightness edge coincident with the outer border of
the radio relic. This edge is likely a shock front.

stellar content of the region, and radio observations obtained at the VLA to
look for the presence of an ultra-compact (UC) HII region and for maser
emission.
  Results: In the optical, Sh2-212 is spherically symmetric around its central
exciting cluster. This HII region is located along a molecular filament. A
thin, well-defined half ring of molecular material surrounds the brightest part
of the HII region at the rear and is fragmented. The most massive fragment
(~200 solar masses) contains a massive young stellar object displaying a
near-IR excess; its spectral energy distribution indicates a high-mass
(~14solar masses), high-temperature (~30000K), and high-luminosity (~17000
solar luminosities) source. This object ionizes a UC HII region.
  Conclusions: Sh2-212 is a good example of massive-star formation triggered
via the collect and collapse process. The massive YSO observed at its periphery
is a good candidate for a massive star formed in isolation.

  perturbed by a delta-kicked rotor",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.79.051402",,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We demonstrate perfect coherence preservation in an atom interferometer
perturbed by kicks from off-resonant standing wave pulses. Under most
conditions, the decoherence induced by the pulses reduces the signal; however,
the coherence is perfectly preserved when the kicking period is equal to the
rational fraction of the inverse atomic recoil frequency, independent of the
number or the randomness of the strength of the applied kicks. The width
narrowing of coherence revival as a function of increasing kick number and
strength provides a new accurate measurement of the recoil frequency.

dot coupled directly to external leads, is considered theoretically. The model
includes Coulomb correlations in the central dot, while such correlations in
the two side-coupled dots are omitted. The infinite-U mean-field slave-boson
approach is used to obtain basic transport characteristics in the Kondo regime.
When tuning position of the side-coupled dots' levels, transition from
subradiant to superradiant like mode (and vice versa) has been found in the
spectral function, in analogy to the Dicke effect in atomic physics. Bias
dependence of the differential conductance and zero frequency shot noise is
also analysed.
