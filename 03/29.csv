respect to those of canonical models. This is, R-symmetry can be broken when
generic R-charge assignments to the fields are made, while it remains unbroken

new runaway directions can be induced. Due to the runaway directions, the

possible to obtain a quantitative estimate of $|J_{\perp}/J|$. In the light of
these results, it is suggested that in magnets of the form
[Cu(HF$_2$)(pyz)$_2$]X, where X is an anion, the sizes of $J$ and $J_{\perp}$
are controlled by the tilting of the pyrazine (pyz) molecule with respect to

neutron facility under construction at the Indiana University Cyclotron
Facility (IUCF). The idea behind LENS is to produce pulsed cold neutron beams
starting with ~MeV neutrons from (p,n) reactions in Be which are moderated to
meV energies and extracted from a small solid angle for use in neutron
instruments which can operate efficiently with relatively broad (~1 msec)
neutron pulse widths. Although the combination of the features and operating
parameters of this source is unique at present, the neutronic design possesses
several features similar to those envisioned for future neutron facilities such
as long-pulsed spallation sources (LPSS) and very cold neutron (VCN) sources.
We describe the underlying ideas and design details of the
target/moderator/reflector system (TMR) and compare measurements of its
brightness, energy spectrum, and emission time distribution under different
moderator configurations with MCNP simulations. Brightness measurements using
an ambient temperature water moderator agree with MCNP simulations within the
20% accuracy of the measurement. The measured neutron emission time
distribution from a solid methane moderator is in agreement with simulation and
the cold neutron flux is sufficient for neutron scattering studies of
materials. We describe some possible modifications to the existing design which
would increase the cold neutron brightness with negligible effect on the
emission time distribution.

This is mainly due to an ambiguity concerning the meaning of the so-called

different conceptions, referred to as potential-functional based fixed-point

We argue that the DKSP scheme, apparently adopted by MBL, is not a

legitimately predicated on the Runge-Gross mapping theorem, is invalid because
the convergence of the fixed-point iteration is not assured.

Applying a recent theorem [Van Zon and Cohen, J. Stat. Phys. 123, 1-37 (2006)]
shows that for sufficiently small times the terms in this series become
successively smaller, so that truncating the series near or at the Gaussian
level might provide a good approximation. In the present paper, we derive a
theoretical estimate for the time scale at which truncating the series at or
near the Gaussian level could be supposed to be accurate for equilibrium
nanoscale systems. In order to numerically estimate this time scale, the
coefficients for the first few terms in the series are determined in computer
simulations for a Lennard-Jones fluid, an isotopic Lennard-Jones mixture and a
suspension of a Lennard-Jones-based model of nanoparticles in a Lennard-Jones
fluid. The results suggest that for Lennard-Jones fluids an expansion around a

in suspension (a nanofluid), the characteristic time scale up to which the
Gaussian is accurate becomes of the order of five to ten picoseconds.

weak lensing increases the minimum detectable value for the non-Gaussianity

correlation distance increases monotonically with luminosity from ~0.5-1h^-1

distance has a complicated dependence on absorber strength, with a
luminosity-dependent peak. (4) Only 15% of O VI absorbers lie near >=Lz*
galaxies. The remaining 85%, then, must arise ``near'' lower-luminosity
galaxies, though, the positions of those galaxies is not well-correlated with
the absorbers. This may point to pollution of intergalactic gas predominantly
by smaller galaxies. (5) There is a subtle trend that for >~0.5Lz* galaxies,
there is a positive correlation between absorber strength and galaxy luminosity
in the sense that stronger absorbers have a slightly higher probability of
finding such a large galaxy at a given projection distance. For less luminous
galaxies, there seems to be a negative correlation between luminosity and

liquid, we find that the cyclotron mass is enhanced by a factor <1/Z_q>, while
the effective Hall mass is proportional to <Z_q> / <Z_q^2>, where <...> implies
an averaging over the Fermi surface. We conclude that if the Z-factor becomes
small in some part of the Fermi surface (e.g., in the case of a Fermi arc), the

small. Possible future experiments are discussed.

This correlation has been revealed from cosmological N-body simulations and is
in conflict with the Extended Press-Schechter model of halo clustering. Using
similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an
early formation epoch with a reduced mass growth rate at late times. We then
find that a primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is
tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range
from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the
large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes
that pass through the massive halo. Using the restricted three-body problem, we
show that haloes are prone to tidal mass loss within 1.5 virial radii of a
larger halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of formation epoch on
environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of
haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong. Our
measures of assembly rate are particularly correlated with the tidal field at
high redshifts z~1.

role in shaping the halo gas of galaxies with substantial bulge components by
conducting 1-D hydrodynamical simulations. The feedback model we consider
consists of two distinct phases: 1) an early starburst during the bulge
formation and 2) a subsequent long-lasting mass and energy injection from
stellar winds of low-mass stars and Type Ia SNe. An energetic outward blastwave
is initiated by the starburst and is maintained and enhanced by the
long-lasting stellar feedback. For a MW-like galactic bulge, this blastwave
sweeps up the halo gas in the proto-galaxy and heats up the surrounding medium
to a scale much beyond the virial radius of the halo, thus the accretion of the
halo hot gas can be completely stopped. In addition, the long-lasting feedback
in the later phase powers a galactic bulge wind that is reverse-shocked at a
large radius in the presence of surrounding intergalactic medium and hence
maintains a hot gaseous halo. As the mass and energy injection decreases with
time, the feedback evolves to a subsonic and quasi-stable outflow, which is
enough to prevent halo gas from cooling. The two phases of the feedback thus
re-enforce each-other's impact on the gas dynamics. The simulation results
demonstrate that the stellar bulge feedback may provide a plausible solution to
the long-standing problems in understanding the MW type galaxies, such as the
""missing stellar feedback"" problem and the ""over-cooling"" problem. The
simulations also show that the properties of the hot gas in the subsonic
outflow state depend sensitively on the environment and the formation history
of the bulge. This dependence and variance may explain the large dispersion in
the X-ray to B-band luminosity ratio of the low $L_X/L_B$ Es.

it are developed to study superconductivity in the vicinity of the Mott
metal-insulator transition. Since the quenching of magnetic moments by
single-site quantum spin fluctuations or the Kondo effect is reduced by the
opening of a superconducting gap, spin density wave (SDW) can appear in a
superconducting state and the Knight shift can deviate from the Yosida function
to be small. The electron-phonon interaction, which arises from the modulation
of the superexchange interaction by phonons, is crucial in the coexistence of
superconductivity and SDW. It is proposed that the coexistence of
superconductivity, a double-Q SDW, a double-Q lattice distortion, and a
double-Q charge density wave induced by the SDW rather than the lattice
distortion, is responsible for the checkerboard structure and the
zero-temperature pseudo-gap observed in under-doped cuprate superconductors.

formation in these galaxies using population synthesis models, carefully
considering the uncertainties on these ages. This system contains a striking
example of `beads on a string': a series of star formation complexes ~1 kpc
apart. These `beads' are found in a tail-like feature that is perpendicular to
the disk of NGC 2856, which implies that it was formed from material accreted
from the companion NGC 2854. The extreme blueness of the optical/UV colors and
redness of the mid-infrared colors implies very young stellar ages (~4 - 20
Myrs) for these star forming regions. Spectral decomposition of these `beads'
shows excess emission above the modeled stellar continuum in the 3.6 micron and
4.5 micron bands, indicating either contributions from interstellar matter to
these fluxes or a second older stellar population. These clumps have -12.0 <
M(B) < -10.6, thus they are less luminous than most dwarf galaxies. Our model
suggests that bridge material falling into the potential of the companion
overshoots the companion. The gas then piles up at apo-galacticon before
falling back onto the companion, and star formation occurs in the pile-up. A
luminous (M(B) ~ -13.6) extended (FWHM ~ 1.3 kpc) `bright spot' is visible at
the northwestern edge of the NGC 2856 disk, with an intermediate stellar
population (400 - 1500 Myrs). Our model suggests that this feature is part of a
expanding ripple-like `arc' created by an off-center ring-galaxy-like collision

subdivide our sample into 426 higher confidence candidates and 75 lower

to the SDSS. A preliminary analysis of the sample generally supports the
standard beaming paradigm. While we recover sizable numbers of low-energy and
intermediate-energy cutoff BL Lacs (LBLs and IBLs, respectively), there are
indications of a potential bias toward recovering high-energy cutoff BL Lacs
(HBLs) from SDSS spectroscopy. Such a large sample may eventually provide new
constraints on BL Lac unification models and their potentially peculiar cosmic
evolution; in particular, our sample contains a significant number of higher

in data volumes and distributed processing in particle physics. Data volumes of
hundreds of Terabytes will be shipped to Tier-2 centres for analysis by the LHC
experiments using the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).
  In many countries Tier-2 centres are distributed between a number of
institutes, e.g., the geographically spread Tier-2s of GridPP in the UK. This
presents a number of challenges for experiments to utilise these centres
efficaciously, as CPU and storage resources may be sub-divided and exposed in
smaller units than the experiment would ideally want to work with. In addition,
unhelpful mismatches between storage and CPU at the individual centres may be
seen, which make efficient exploitation of a Tier-2's resources difficult.
  One method of addressing this is to unify the storage across a distributed
Tier-2, presenting the centres' aggregated storage as a single system. This
greatly simplifies data management for the VO, which then can access a greater
amount of data across the Tier-2. However, such an approach will lead to
scenarios where analysis jobs on one site's batch system must access data
hosted on another site.
  We investigate this situation using the Glasgow and Edinburgh clusters, which
are part of the ScotGrid distributed Tier-2. In particular we look at how to
mitigate the problems associated with ``distant'' data access and discuss the
security implications of having LAN access protocols traverse the WAN between
centres.

projected rotational velocity is very much lower than the critical limit,
contrary to what is expected for a typical Be star. The emission has been
attributed to the secondary component of the $\beta$ Cep spectroscopic binary
system.
  In this paper, using both ours and archived spectra, we attempted to recover
the H$\alpha$ profile of the secondary component and to analyze its behavior
with time for a long period. To accomplish this task, we first derived the
atmospheric parameters of the primary: T$_{\rm eff}$ = 24000 $\pm$ 250 K and
$\log g$ = 3.91 $\pm$ 0.10, then we used these values to compute its synthetic
H$\alpha$ profile and finally we reconstructed the secondary's profile
disentangling the observed one.
  The secondary's H$\alpha$ profile shows the typical two peaks emission of a
Be star with a strong variability. We analyzed also the behavior versus time of
some line width parameters: equivalent width, V/R, FWHM, peaks separation and
radial velocity of the central depression.
  Projected rotational velocity ($v \sin i$) of the secondary and the dimension
of the equatorial surrounding disk have been estimated, too.

longitudinal spin accumulation inside the ferromagnet. A tunnel barrier then
acts as a nonintrusive probe that converts the spin accumulation into a
measurable voltage. Neither of the proposed mechanisms suffers from spin
relaxation, which is typically fast on the scale of the exponentially slow
tunneling rates. The longitudinal spin-accumulation buildup, however, is very
sensitive to the phenomenological ingredients of the spin-relaxation picture.

wave function are carefully analyzed for giving a well understanding of the
hard contributions at the energy region where pQCD is applicable. The right
power behavior of the hard contribution from the higher helicity components and
from the higher twist structures can be obtained by keeping the $k_T$

power-suppressed terms (twist-3 and higher helicity components) make an
important contribution below $Q^2\sim several GeV^2$ although they drop fast as

fixed by the first two moments of its distribution amplitude and other

temperature are measured near the sidewall of a rectangular cell. It is found
that, although they are advected by the same turbulent flow, the two scalars
distribute differently. This difference is twofold, i.e. both the quantities
themselves and their small-scale increments have different distributions. Our
results show that there is a certain buoyant scale based on time domain, i.e.
the Bolgiano time scale $t_B$, above which buoyancy effects are significant.
Above $t_B$, temperature is active and is found to be more intermittent than
concentration, which is passive. This suggests that the active scalar possesses
a higher level of intermittency in turbulent thermal convection. It is further
found that the mixing of both scalar fields are isotropic for scales larger
than $t_B$ even though buoyancy acts on the fluid in the vertical direction.
Below $t_B$, temperature is passive and is found to be more anisotropic than
concentration. But this higher degree of anisotropy is attributed to the higher
diffusivity of temperature over that of concentration. From the simultaneous
measurements of temperature and concentration, it is shown that two scalars
have similar autocorrelation functions and there is a strong and positive
correlation between them.

  Singapour (2007)",,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to many optimization problems in
organizations often results in good performance and high quality solutions. For
successful and efficient use of GAs, it is not enough to simply apply simple
GAs (SGAs). In addition, it is necessary to find a proper representation for
the problem and to develop appropriate search operators that fit well to the
properties of the genotype encoding. The representation must at least be able
to encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic
operators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this
paper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the
framework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function
optimization. Likewise, a new variant of GAs for difficult optimization
problems denoted {\it Split-and-Merge} GA (SM-GA) is developed using a parallel
implementation of an SGA and evolving a dynamic exchange of individual
representation in the context of Dual Coding concept. Numerical experiments
show that the evolved SM-GA significantly outperforms an SGA with static single
coding.

spectroscopy of the circumstellar nebula around Sher 25, and of the background
nebula of the host cluster NGC 3603. We perform a detailed nebular abundance
analysis to measure the gas-phase abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neon
and argon. The oxygen abundance in the circumstellar nebula (12 + log[O/H] =
8.61 +/- 0.13 dex) is similar to that in the background nebula (8.56 +/- 0.07),
suggesting the composition of the host cluster is around solar. However, we
confirm that the circumstellar nebula is very rich in nitrogen, with an
abundance of 8.91 +/- 0.15, compared to the background value of 7.47 +/- 0.18.
A new analysis of the stellar spectrum with the FASTWIND model atmosphere code
suggests that the photospheric nitrogen and oxygen abundances in Sher 25 are
consistent with the nebular results. While the nitrogen abundances are high,
when compared to stellar evolutionary models they do not unambiguously confirm
that the star has undergone convective dredge-up during a previous red
supergiant phase. We suggest that the more likely scenario is that the nebula
was ejected from the star while it was in the blue supergiant phase. The star's
initial mass was around 50 M_sun, which is rather too high for it to have had a
convective envelope stage as a red supergiant. Rotating stellar models that
lead to mixing of core-processed material to the stellar surface during core
H-burning can quantitatively match the stellar results with the nebula
abundances.

dissipative term of hydrodynamical equations leads asymptotically to truncated
inviscid \textit{conservative} dynamics with a finite range of spatial Fourier
modes. Those at large wavenumbers thermalize, whereas modes at small
wavenumbers obey ordinary viscous dynamics [C. Cichowlas et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 95, 264502 (2005)]. The energy bottleneck observed for finite $\alpha$
may be interpreted as incomplete thermalization. Artifacts arising from models
with $\alpha > 1$ are discussed.

terms of the spatial spin distribution and dynamics. It emerged that an
additional spin wave mode was stimulated by the direct-current (DC) current and
that this spin wave was detectable via rectification of the RF current. A
phenomenological model to describe the time-dependent anisotropic
magnetoresistance or time-dependent planer Hall effect is proposed and found to
correlate well to the experimental results. The nonlinear spin dynamics
accompanying additional spin waves are studied as functions of the RF and DC
currents, the external magnetic field, and the applied field direction.

mechanics in the 't Hooft limit. Maldacena duality conjectures that in this
limit the theory is dual to IIA string theory, and in particular that the
behavior of the thermal theory at low temperature is equivalent to that of
certain black holes in IIA supergravity. Our simulations probe the low
temperature regime for N <= 5 and the intermediate and high temperature regimes
for N <= 12. We observe 't Hooft scaling and at low temperatures our results
are consistent with the dual black hole prediction. The intermediate
temperature range is dual to the Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence region, and
our results are consistent with smooth behavior there. We include the Pfaffian
phase arising from the fermions in our calculations where appropriate.
