supersymmetry breaking, where they elegantly solve the dark matter problem. The
framework accommodates single or multiple component dark matter, dark matter
masses from 10 MeV to 10 TeV, and interaction strengths from gravitational to
strong. These candidates enhance many direct and indirect signals relative to
WIMPs and have qualitatively new implications for dark matter searches and
cosmological implications for colliders.

B_t(psi) on states on the algebra of non-commutative polynomials, or
equivalently on joint distributions of d-tuples of non-commuting operators.
These transformations are related to free probability: Phi intertwines the
action of B_t and the free convolution with the semigroup {rho_t}. The maps
{B_t} were introduced by Belinschi and Nica as a semigroup of transformations
such that B_1 is the bijection between infinitely divisible distributions in
the Boolean and free probability theories. They proved the intertwining
property above for a single-variable version of the map Phi and the particular
case of the free heat semigroup. The more general two-variable map Phi comes,
not from free probability, but from the theory of two-state algebras, also
called the conditionally free probability theory, introduced by Bozejko,
Leinert, and Speicher. Orthogonality of the c-free versions of the Appell
polynomials, investigated in arXiv:0803.4279, is closely related to the
single-variable map Phi. On the other hand, more general free Meixner families
behave well under all the transformations above, and provide clues to their
general behavior. Besides the evolution equation, other results include the
positivity of the map Phi and descriptions of its fixed points and range.

quantum lattice Hamiltonian models with non-abelian discrete gauge symmetry.
The topological order present in the models can be partially destroyed by
introducing a gauge symmetry reduction mechanism. When symmetry is reduced in
several islands only, this imposes boundary conditions to the rest of the
system giving rise to topological ground state degeneracy. This degeneracy is
related to the existence of topological fluxes in between islands or,
alternatively, hidden charges at islands. Additionally, island deformations
give rise to an extension of topological quantum computation beyond
quasiparticles.

distinguishing different cosmological models. With a model independent
approach, we constrain the possible evolution of the dark energy EOS. Gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) of redshifts up to $z>6$ are used, in addition to type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). We separate the redshifts into 4 bins and assume a
constant EOS parameter for dark energy in each bin. The EOS parameters are
decorrelated by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. And the evolution of dark
energy is estimated out of the uncorrelated EOS parameters. By including GRB
luminosity data, we significantly reduce the confidence interval of the
uncorrelated EOS parameter whose contribution mostly comes from the redshift
bin of $0.5<z<1.8$. At high redshift where we only have GRBs, the constraints
on the dark energy EOS are still very weak. However, we can see an obvious cut
at about zero in the probability plot of the EOS parameter, from which we can
infer that the ratio of dark energy to matter most probably continues to
decrease beyond redshift 1.8. We carried out analyses with and without
including the latest BAO measurements, which themselves favor a dark energy EOS
of $w<-1$. If they are included, the results show some evidence of an evolving
dark energy EOS. If not included, however, the results are consistent with the
cosmological constant within $1 \sigma$ for redshift $0<z \lesssim 0.5$ and $2

It is extended to treat gravitational settling and is applied to the
static-stationary case of substellar model atmospheres. From the solution for
the dust moments, we determine the grain size distribution function which,
together with the calculated material volume fractions, provides the basis to
calculate the opacities of the composite dust grains. The cloud particles in
brown dwarfs and hot giant-gas planets are found to be small in the high
atmospheric layers (0.01mum), and composed of a rich mixture of all considered
condensates, in particular the abundant MgSiO3[s], Mg2SiO4[s] and SiO2[s]. As
the particles settle downward, they increase in size and reach several 100mum
in the deepest layers. The more volatile parts of the grains evaporate and the
particles stepwise purify to form composite particles of high-temperature
condensates in the deeper layers, mainly Fe[s] and Al2O3[s]. The gas phase
abundances of the elements involved in the dust formation process vary by
orders of magnitudes throughout the atmosphere. The grain size distribution is
found to be relatively broad in the upper atmospheric layers but often strongly
peaked in the deeper layers. The spectral appearance of the cloud layers in the
mid IR (7-20mum) is close to a grey body with only weak broad features on a few
percent level, mainly caused by MgSiO3[s], and Mg2SiO4[s]. Our models predict
that the gas phase depletion is much weaker as compared to phase-equilibrium
calculations in the high atmospheric layers. [abridged]
