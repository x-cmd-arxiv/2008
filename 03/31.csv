renormalization scale mu controlling the absorption of ultraviolet fluctuations
into the mass, and a scale R controlling the absorption of infrared
fluctuations. 1/R can be thought of as the radius for perturbative corrections
that build up the mass beyond its point-like definition in the pole scheme.
Treating R as a variable gives a renormalization group equation. We argue that
the sign of this anomalous dimension is universal: increasing R to add IR modes
decreases m(R). The flow improves the stability of conversions between mass
schemes, allowing us to avoid large logs and the renormalon. The flow in R can
be used to study IR renormalons without using bubble chains, and we use it to
determine the coefficient of the LambdaQCD renormalon ambiguity of the pole
mass with a convergent sum-rule.

initial data identified as representing the exterior spacetime of uniform and
non-uniform spheroids of matter. By imposing that the radiation field is a
decreasing function of the retarded time, the Schwarzschild solution is the
asymptotic configuration after an intermediate Vaidya phase. The main
consequence of the joint emission of gravitational waves and the null radiation

arise when performing local measurements on separate quantum systems. In a
previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 010401 (2007)], we introduced an infinite
hierarchy of conditions necessarily satisfied by any set of quantum
correlations. Each of these conditions could be tested using semidefinite
programming. We present here new results concerning this hierarchy. We prove in
particular that it is complete, in the sense that any set of correlations
satisfying every condition in the hierarchy has a quantum representation in
terms of commuting measurements. Although our tests are conceived to rule out
non-quantum correlations, and can in principle certify that a set of
correlations is quantum only in the asymptotic limit where all tests are
satisfied, we show that in some cases it is possible to conclude that a given
set of correlations is quantum after performing only a finite number of tests.
We provide a criterion to detect when such a situation arises, and we explain
how to reconstruct the quantum states and measurement operators reproducing the
given correlations. Finally, we present several applications of our approach.
We use it in particular to bound the quantum violation of various Bell
inequalities.

time spent by each MPI task on previous time-step is used to adjust boundaries
for the next time-step. For a typical decomposition of 5^3 domains, the number
of possible changes in boundaries is 3^{84}. We describe two algorithms of
finding minimum of CPU time for configurations with a large number of domains.
Each MPI task in our code solves the N-body problem where the large-scale
distribution of matter outside of the boundaries of a domain is represented by
relatively few temporary large particles created by other domains. At the
beginning of a zero-level time-step, domains create and exchange large
particles. Then each domain advances all its particles for many small
time-steps. At the end of the large step, the domains decide where to place new
boundaries and re-distribute particles. The scheme requires little
communications between processors and is very efficient for large cosmological
simulations.

very small doping, while the superconducting ordering emerges at small finite
doping, whose pairing symmetry is qualitatively analyzed to be of nodal d-wave.

Determining which vertices are most ""central"" in a semantic network is
difficult because one relationship type may be deemed subjectively more
important than another. For this reason, research into semantic network metrics
has focused primarily on context-based rankings (i.e. user prescribed
contexts). Moreover, many of the current semantic network metrics rank semantic
associations (i.e. directed paths between two vertices) and not the vertices
themselves. This article presents a framework for calculating semantically
meaningful primary eigenvector-based metrics such as eigenvector centrality and
PageRank in semantic networks using a modified version of the random walker

be well described by a set of stochastic differential equations. Inspired by an
insight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda
genetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification
of generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of
stochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the
potential function $\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix
$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is
then precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or
not it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear. A rather complete
analysis has been carried out (Kwon, Ao, Thouless, cond-mat/0506280; PNAS, {\bf
102} (2005) 13029), referred to as SDS I. One important and persistent question
is the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with
multiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state
properties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into
stochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global
optimization potential function. First, we provide the construction. One of
most important ingredient is the generalized Einstein relation. We then present
an approximation scheme: The gradient expansion which turns every order into
linear matrix equations. The consistent of such methodology with other known
stochastic treatments will be discussed in next paper, SDS III; and the
explicitly connection to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics will be
discussed in a forthcoming paper, SDS IV.

gracefully approach seemingly routine pop-ups. This paper describes a set of
towering pop-ups with trajectories that exhibit cusps and loops near the apex.
For a normal fly ball, the horizontal velocity is continuously decreasing due
to drag caused by air resistance. But for pop-ups, the Magnus force (the force
due to the ball spinning in a moving airflow) is larger than the drag force. In
these cases the horizontal velocity decreases in the beginning, like a normal
fly ball, but after the apex, the Magnus force accelerates the horizontal
motion. We refer to this class of pop-ups as paradoxical because they appear to
misinform the typically robust optical control strategies used by fielders and
lead to systematic vacillation in running paths, especially when a trajectory
terminates near the fielder. In short, some of the dancing around when
infielders pursue pop-ups can be well explained as a combination of bizarre
trajectories and misguidance by the normally reliable optical control strategy,
rather than apparent fielder error. Former major league infielders confirm that
our model agrees with their experiences.

structure, then each conformation would_functionally_ code only one bit, making
it difficult to explain large memories. Nor is there a simple way to relate
memory to protein dynamics on current molecular dynamics (MD), which is
memoryless. Here we point out that MD may be modified to involve memory ab
initio without any new hypothesis: simply replace the electrostatic (Coulomb)
force by the electrodynamic force--which is more accurate. We now need to solve
functional differential equations (FDEs), instead of the ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) currently solved in MD. Unlike ODEs, retarded FDEs are
history-dependent: so memory is already present even at the level of
interacting sites within molecules. The resulting increase in computational
complexity is within the reach of current computers. While Amdahl's law does
pose a challenge to parallelised time-stepping with this model, the
compute-intensive part--the force calculation--may still be carried out in
parallel. Thus, reformulating MD to use FDEs is feasible, and this could help
to understand the possible dynamical basis of memory.

properties quite distinct as compared to the standard black hole solutions of
general relativity. We close the structure equations by assuming a simple
linear equation of state for the dark pressure. In this case the vacuum is
Jacobi stable only for a small range of values of the proportionality constant
relating the dark pressure and the dark radiation. The unstable trajectories on
the brane behave chaotically, in the sense that after a finite radial distance
it would be impossible to distinguish the trajectories that were very near each
other at an initial point. Hence the Jacobi stability analysis offers a
powerful method for constraining the physical properties of the vacuum on the

therefore the photons produced at one radius can travel for a long distance
without being absorbed. These photons thus can heat or cool electrons at other
radii via Compton scattering. This effect has been ignored in most previous
works on hot accretion flows and is the focus of this paper. If the mass
accretion rate is described by $\dot{M}=\dot{M}_0(r/r_{\rm out})^{0.3}$ and
$r_{\rm out}=10^4r_{\rm s}$, we find that the Compton scattering will play a
cooling and heating role at $r\la 5\times 10^3 r_{\rm s}$ and $r\ga 5\times
10^3 r_{\rm s}$, respectively. Specifically, when $\dot{M}_0>0.1L_{\rm
Edd}/c^2$, the Compton cooling rate is larger than the local viscous heating
rate at certain radius; therefore the cooling effect is important. When
$\dot{M}_0>2L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, the heating effect at $r_{\rm out}$ is important.
We can obtain the self-consistent steady solution with the global Compton
effect included only if $\dot{M}_0\la L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ for $r_{\rm
out}=50r_{\rm s}$, which corresponds to $L\la 0.02L_{\rm Edd}$. Above this rate
the Compton cooling is so strong at the inner region that hot solutions can not
exist. On the other hand, for $r_{\rm out}= 10^5r_{\rm s}$, we can only get the
self-consistent solution when $\dot{M}_0\la L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ and $L<0.01L_{\rm
Edd}$. Above this accretion rate the equilibrium temperature of electrons at
$r_{\rm out}$ is higher than the virial temperature as a result of strong
Compton heating, so the accretion is suppressed. In this case the activity of
the black hole will likely ""oscillate"" between an active and an inactive
phases, with the oscillation timescale being the radiative timescale of the gas
at $r_{\rm out}$.

observe thatlocal heating and inelastic current have significant
isotope-substitution effects. Due to the contact characters, the energies of
excited molecular vibrationsare inverse proportional to the square root of the
mass. The heavier the molecule, the smaller the onset bias. In the $H_{2}$ and
$D_{2}$ junctions, the heavier molecule has a smaller magnitude of
electron-vibration interaction. Consequently, there is a crossing in the local
temperature around $80 K$. In the HD junction, the electron-vibration
interaction is enhanced by asymmetric distribution in mass. It leads to the
largest discontinuity in the differential conductance and the most prominent
heating in the HD junction. We predict that the junction instability is
relevant to isotope substitution. The HD junction has the smallest breakdown
voltage compared with the $H_{2}$ and $D_{2}$ junction.

account the magnifications afforded by our clusters (1-4 magnitudes), we probe
the presence of z>7 sources to unlensed limits of J_{110}~=30 AB, fainter than
those charted in the Hubble Ultradeep Field. To verify the fidelity of our
candidates we conduct a number of tests for instrumental effects which would
lead to spurious detections, and carefully evaluate the likelihood of
foreground contamination by considering photometric uncertainties in the
drop-out signature, the upper limits from stacked IRAC data and the statistics
of multiply-imaged sources. Overall, we conclude that we can expect about half
of our sample of z-band drop-outs are likely to be at high redshift. An
ambitious infrared spectroscopic campaign undertaken with the NIRSPEC
spectrograph at the WM Keck Observatory for seven of the most promising
candidates failed to detect any Lyman-alpha emission highlighting the challenge
of making further progress in this field. While the volume density of high
redshift sources will likely remain uncertain until more powerful facilities
are available, our data provides the first potentially interesting constraints
on the UV luminosity function at z~=7.5 at intrinsically faint limits. We
discuss the implications of our results in the context of the hypothesis that
the bulk of the reionizing photons in the era 7<z<12 arise in low luminosity

classes of random polynomials which recently attracted a vivid interest in the
context of probability theory and quantum chaos. We first focus on gap
probabilities on the real axis, i.e. the probability that these polynomials
have no real root in a given interval. For generalized Kac polynomials, indexed
by an integer d, of large degree n, one finds that the probability of no real
root in the interval [0,1] decays as a power law n^{-\theta(d)} where \theta(d)
> 0 is the persistence exponent of the diffusion equation with random initial
conditions in spatial dimension d. For n \gg 1 even, the probability that they
have no real root on the full real axis decays like
n^{-2(\theta(2)+\theta(d))}. For Weyl polynomials and Binomial polynomials,
this probability decays respectively like \exp{(-2\theta_{\infty}} \sqrt{n})
and \exp{(-\pi \theta_{\infty} \sqrt{n})} where \theta_{\infty} is such that
\theta(d) = 2^{-3/2} \theta_{\infty} \sqrt{d} in large dimension d. We also
show that the probability that such polynomials have exactly k roots on a given
interval [a,b] has a scaling form given by \exp{(-N_{ab} \tilde
\phi(k/N_{ab}))} where N_{ab} is the mean number of real roots in [a,b] and
\tilde \phi(x) a universal scaling function. We develop a simple Mean Field
(MF) theory reproducing qualitatively these scaling behaviors, and improve
systematically this MF approach using the method of persistence with partial
survival, which in some cases yields exact results. Finally, we show that the
probability density function of the largest absolute value of the real roots
has a universal algebraic tail with exponent {-2}. These analytical results are
confirmed by detailed numerical computations.

least the last 30 years from an extraordinary stable electricity grid. This
stability was achieved by the european grid system and a large flexible and
reliable spare power plant capacity. This system allowed a continuous demand
growth during the past 10-20 years of up to a few % per year. However,
partially due to this overcapacity, no new large power plants have been
completed during the past 10-15 years. The obvious consequence is that the
reliable spare capacity has been reduced and that a further yearly demand
growth of 1-2% for electric energy can only be achieved if new power plants
will be constructed soon. Data from various European countries, provided by the
UCTE, indicate that the system stress during peak load times and especially
during particular cold winter days is much larger than generally assumed. In
fact, the latest UCTE data on reliable power capacity indicate that already
during the Winter 2007/8 only a few very cold winter days in Western Europe
could have resulted in very unpleasant supply problems during the early evening
peak load times in France and the neighboring countries.
  An analysis of the potential to build and operate new power plants
demonstrates that no short term solution, which allows a further continuous
1-2% consumption growth seems to exist. Thus, without any action from the
various governments in Europe to reduce the electricity demand in a serious
way, the risk of blackouts will increase dramatically in the near future.
Instead of simply waiting for the blackout disaster to happen, a few simple
short term political actions are suggested.

regions where the thermal to magnetic pressure ratio is small. Because of the
low-ionisation fraction in molecular clouds, neutral and charged particles are
weakly coupled. Ambipolar diffusion then plays an important role in the
formation process. A quiescent, uniform plasma is perturbed by a fast-mode
wave. Using 2D numerical simulations, we follow the evolution of the fast-mode
wave. The simulations are done with a multifluid, adaptive mesh refinement MHD
code. Initial perturbations with wavelengths that are 2 orders of magnitude
larger than the dissipation length are strongly affected by the ion-neutral
drift. Only in situations where there are large variations in the magnetic
field corresponding to a highly turbulent gas can fast-mode waves generate
dense cores. This means that, in most cores, no substructure can be produced.
However, Core D of TMC-1 is an exception to this case. Due to its atypically
high ionisation fraction, waves with wavelengths up to 3 orders of magnitude
greater than the dissipation length can be present. Such waves are only weakly
affected by ambipolar diffusion and can produce dense substructure without
large wave-amplitudes. Our results also explain the observed transition from
Alfvenic turbulent motion at large scales to subsonic motions at the level of
dense cores.

($I_{e}$), and velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{0}$) - form a tight planar
correlation known as the fundamental plane (FP), which has provided great
insights into the galaxy formation and the evolution processes. However, the FP
has been found to be tilted against the simple virial expectation, prompting
debates on its origin. In order to investigate the contribution of systematic
stellar population variation to the FP tilt, we study here the FP relations of
early-type galaxies in mid-infrared (MIR) which may represent the stellar mass
well. We examined the wavelength dependence of the FP coefficients, $a$ and $b$
in $\log r_{e}= a\log\sigma_{0} + b\log< I >_{e} + c$, using a sample of 56
early-type galaxies for which visible (V-band), near-infrared (K-band), and MIR
(Spitzer IRAC, 3.6--8.0$\mu$m) data are available. We find that the coefficient
$a$ increases as a function of wavelength as $da/d\lambda=0.11\pm0.04\mu
m^{-1}$, while the coefficient $b$ reaches the closest to -1 at 3.6--5.8$\mu$m.
When applied to the visible FP coefficients derived from a larger sample of
nearby early-type galaxies, we get the FP relation with $(a,b) \simeq
$(1.6--1.8,-0.9) at 3.6$\mu$m. Our result suggests that the stellar population
effect can explain more than half of the FP tilt, closing the gap between the
virial expectation and the optical FP. The reduction in the FP tilt is
reflected in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio, $M_{dyn}/L$, dependence on $L$
which decreases toward 3.6--5.8$\mu$m, suggesting that the MIR light better
represents mass than the shorter wavelengths.

parts of the complex nonlinearity of abrupt glacial climate changes (the
so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events) to a few simple principles, namely (i) a
threshold process, (ii) an overshooting in the stability of the system and
(iii) a millennial-scale relaxation. By comparison with a so-called Earth
system model of intermediate complexity (CLIMBER-2), in which the events
represent oscillations between two climate states corresponding to two
fundamentally different modes of deep-water formation in the North Atlantic, we
demonstrate that the conceptual model captures fundamental aspects of the
nonlinearity of the events in that model. We use the conceptual model in order
to reproduce and reanalyse nonlinear resonance mechanisms that were already
suggested in order to explain the characteristic time scale of
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. In doing so we identify a new form of stochastic
resonance (i.e. an overshooting stochastic resonance) and provide the first
explicitly reported manifestation of ghost resonance in a geosystem, i.e. of a
mechanism which could be relevant for other systems with thresholds and with
multiple states of operation. Our work enables us to explicitly simulate
realistic probability measures of Dansgaard-Oeschger events (e.g. waiting time
distributions, which are a prerequisite for statistical analyses on the
regularity of the events by means of Monte-Carlo simulations). We thus think
that our study is an important advance in order to develop more adequate
methods to test the statistical significance and the origin of the proposed
glacial 1470-year climate cycle.

propose maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of those MNLMEMs with two
levels of random effects, using an extension of the SAEM-MCMC algorithm. The
extended SAEM algorithm is split into an explicit direct EM algorithm and a
stochastic EM part. Compared to the original algorithm, additional sufficient
statistics have to be approximated by relying on the conditional distribution
of the second level of random effects. This estimation method is evaluated on
pharmacokinetic cross-over simulated trials, mimicking theophyllin
concentration data. Results obtained on those datasets with either the SAEM
algorithm or the FOCE algorithm (implemented in the nlme function of R

analyze the pharmacokinetic interaction of tenofovir on atazanavir, a novel

Results. Using only this method, we repeatedly stabilised the dark fringe for

in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. Nonzero shear viscosity reduces the
colling rate of the system and hinders the acceleration of the longitudinal
flow. As a consequence, the initial energy density needed to reproduce the
experimental data at RHIC energies is significantly reduced. At LHC energies,
we expect that shear viscosity helps to conserve a Bjorken plateau in the
rapidity distributions during the expansion.

find solutions as also dispersion relations in different regimes of the

for a free photon in expanding background we get maximum redshift in 4D

Further wave propagation in magnetised plasma is possible for a restricted
frequency range only, depending on the number of dimensions. Relevant to point
out that unlike the special relativistic result this allowed range evolves with
time. Interestingly the dielectric constant of the plasma media remains
constant, not sharing the expansion of the background, which generalises a
similar 4D result of Holcomb-Tajima in radiation background to the case of
higher dimensions with cosmic matter obeying an equation of state . Further,
analogous to the flat space static case we observe the phenomenon of Faraday

inclined plane are investigated experimentally for different materials and for
a variety of grain shapes ranging from spherical beads to highly anisotropic
particles with dendritic shape. We measure the front velocity, area and the
height of many avalanches and correlate the motion with the area and height. We
also measure the avalanche profiles for several example cases. As the shape
irregularity of the grains is increased, there is a dramatic qualitative change
in avalanche properties. For rough non-spherical grains, avalanches are faster,
bigger and overturning in the sense that individual particles have down-slope
speeds $u_p$ that exceed the front speed $u_f$ as compared with avalanches of
spherical glass beads that are quantitatively slower, smaller and where
particles always travel slower than the front speed. There is a linear increase
of three quantities i) dimensionless avalanche height ii) ratio of particle to
front speed and iii) the growth rate of avalanche speed with increasing
avalanche size with increasing $\tan\theta_r$ where $\theta_r$ is the bulk
angle of repose, or with increasing $\beta_P$, the slope of the depth averaged
flow rule, where both $\theta_r$ and $\beta_P$ reflect the grain shape
irregularity. These relations provide a tool for predicting important dynamical
properties of avalanches as a function of grain shape irregularity. A
relatively simple depth-averaged theoretical description captures some
important elements of the avalanche motion, notably the existence of two
regimes of this motion.

walk on a line, in the sense that it leaves the position probability
distribution invariant. However, this symmetry breaks down in the case of a
quantum walk on an n-cycle, and hence can be regarded as a probe of the walk
topology. Noise, modelled here as phase flip and generalized amplitude damping

not entirely classical, because noise also has the effect of desensitizing the

of electron-electron collision as an efficient control factor for ultrafast

nonequilibrium drives a complex absorption pattern with consequences on the
transient optical properties. Consequently, high electronic temperatures
determine largely the collision frequency and establish a transition between
absorptive regimes in solid and plasma phases. In particular, taking into
account umklapp electron-electron collisions, we performed hydrodynamic
simulations of the laser-matter interaction to calculate laser energy
deposition during the electron-ion nonequilibrium stage and subsequent matter
transformation phases. We observe strong correlations between optical and
thermodynamic properties according to the experimental situations. A suitable
connection between solid and plasma regimes is chosen in accordance with models
that describe the behavior in extreme, asymptotic regimes. The proposed
approach describes as well situations encountered in pump-probe types of
experiments, where the state of matter is probed after initial excitation.
Comparison with experimental measurements shows simulation results which are
sufficiently accurate to interpret the observed material behavior. A numerical
probe is proposed to analyze the transient optical properties of matter exposed
to ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation at moderate and high intensities.
Various thermodynamic states are assigned to the observed optical variation.

from source to source, even after correcting for additional extinction in the

template for extragalactic young massive star clusters, because it is currently
the only nearby young cluster which reaches a mass of around 10^5 Msun. The
proximity makes spatially resolved studies of its stellar population feasible,
and additionally permits direct comparison of its properties with measurements
of velocity dispersion and dynamical mass for spatially unresolved
extragalactic clusters.
  Recently, we published the dynamical mass estimate based on spectra of four
red supergiants. We have now identified six additional stars which allow a
determination of radial velocity from the wavelength covered in our VLT/ISAAC
near-infrared spectra (CO bandhead region near 2.29micron), improving
statistics significantly. Using a combination of stepping and scanning the slit
across the cluster centre, we covered an area which included the following
suitable spectral types: four red supergiants, five yellow hypergiants, and one
B-type emission line star.
  Our measured velocity dispersion is 9.2 km/s. Together with the cluster size
of 0.86 pc, derived from archival near-infrared SOFI-NTT images, this yields a
dynamical mass of 1.5x10^5 Msun. Comparing this to the mass derived via
photometry, there is no indication that the cluster is currently undergoing
dissolution.

nonperturbative in the string tension and so would not appear in the spacetime
effective action, producing a unique signature of string theory and the details
of compactification. By performing a Bogomol'nyi transformation it is shown
that there are no instanton solutions in the simplest model proposed by Harvey

solutions. If such instantons do exist, their effect might be measured by
upcoming experiments.

energies) of direct detection experiments. Our method is independent of the as
yet unknown WIMP density near the Earth, of the form of the WIMP velocity
distribution, as well as of the WIMP-nucleus cross section. However, it
requires positive signals from at least two detectors with different target
nuclei. In a background-free environment, $m_\chi \sim 50$ GeV could in
principle be determined with an error of $\sim 35%$ with only $2 \times 50$
events; in practice upper and lower limits on the recoil energy of signal
events, imposed to reduce backgrounds, can increase the error. The method also
loses precision if $m_\chi$ significantly exceeds the mass of the heaviest
target nucleus used.

which contains the polynomial one as its graded Euler characteristic. This
field has been initiated by Khovanov categorification of the Jones polynomial.
Later, P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo gave a categorification of Alexander polynomial.
Besides their increased abilities for distinguishing knots, this new invariants
seem to carry many geometrical informations. On the other hand, Vassiliev works
gives another way to study link invariant, by generalizing them to singular
links i.e. links with a finite number of rigid transverse double points. The
first part of this thesis deals with a possible relation between these two
approaches in the case of the Alexander polynomial. To this purpose, we extend
grid presentation for links to singular links. Then we use it to generalize
Ozsvath and Szabo invariant to singular links. Besides the consistency of its
definition, we prove that this invariant is acyclic under some conditions which
naturally make its Euler characteristic vanish. This work can be considered as
a first step toward a categorification of Vassiliev theory. In a second part,
we give a refinement of Khovanov homology to restricted links. Restricted links
are link diagrams up to a restricted set of Reidemeister moves. In particular,
closed braids can be seen as a subset of them. Such a refinement give then a
new tool for studying knots and their deformations.

be stored in flash memories within the communicating chip units at hidden

disassembled, and the eavesdropper can have direct access to the communication
lines between the units, or even if she is trying to use a man-in-the-middle

learn the chip structure, to understand the machine code program and to read

even that can be prohibited by a password lockout. The unconditional security
of commercial algorithms against piracy can be provided in a similar way.
