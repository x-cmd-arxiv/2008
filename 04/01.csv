supersymmetric model with four chiral generations. The additional chiral
fermions (and scalar partners) lower the critical temperature and thus
strengthen the first-order phase transition. The scalar partners stabilize the
potential, leading to an effective theory that is bounded from below. We
identify the ensemble of parameters where phi_c/T_c \gsim 1 simultaneous with
obtaining a large enough Higgs mass. Our calculations focus on a subset of the
full four generational supersymmetric parameter space: We take the pseudoscalar
heavy, tan(beta)=1, and neglect all subleading contributions to the effective
potential. We find that the region of parameter space with a strong first-order
phase transition requires m_tilde{q}'/m_q' \lsim 1.1 while the constraint on
the lightest Higgs mass requires m_tilde{q}'/m_q' /gsim 1 with m_q' \gsim 300

1/\sqrt{Cov(f1,f2,f3,...)}, where Cov(f1,f2,f3,...) is the covariance matrix of
{f_i}. The {f_i} should be minimally correlated. We demonstrate two useful

l_a(z_*), \Omega_b h^2] from the five year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) observations, and SDSS measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale, assuming the HST prior of H_0=72+/-8 km/s Mpc^{-1} and without
assuming spatial flatness. We find that the correlation of (w_0,w_{0.5})

significantly smaller than that of (w_0,w_a) [w_X(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a]. In order to
obtain model-independent constraints on DE, we parametrize the DE density

X_{1.5} [values of X(z) at z=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5] as free parameters estimated
from data. If one assumes a linear DE equation of state, current data are
consistent with a cosmological constant at 68% C.L. If one assumes X(z) to be a
free function parametrized by (X_{0.5}, X_{1.0}, X_{1.5}), current data deviate
from a cosmological constant at z=1 at 68% C.L., but are consistent with a
cosmological constant at 95% C.L.. Future DE experiments will allow us to
dramatically increase the FoM of constraints on (w_0,w_{0.5}) and of (X_{0.5},
X_{1.0}, X_{1.5}). This will significantly shrink the DE parameter space to
enable the discovery of DE evolution, or the conclusive evidence for a

consistently show a proportionality between M_c and the thermal Jeans mass M_J
at the time of cloud fragmentation, but no models have explained how it can be
the same in diverse conditions. Here we show that M_J depends weakly on
density, temperature, metallicity, and radiation field in three environments:
the dense cores where stars form, larger star-forming regions ranging from GMCs
to galactic disks, and the interiors of HII regions and super star clusters. In
dense cores, the quantity T^{3/2}n^{-1/2} that appears in M_J scales with core
density as n^{0.25} or with radiation density as U^{0.1} at the density where
dust and gas come into thermal equilibrium. On larger scales, this quantity
varies with ambient density as n^{-0.05} and ambient radiation field as
U^{-0.033} when the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star formation determines U(n). In
super star clusters with ionization and compression of pre-stellar globules,
M_J varies as the 0.13 power of the cluster column density. These weak
dependencies on n, U, and column density imply that most environmental
variations affect the thermal Jeans mass by at most a factor of ~2.
Cosmological increases in M_J, which have been suggested by observations, may
be explained if the star formation efficiency is systematically higher at high
redshift for a given density and pressure, if dust grains are smaller at lower
metallicity, and so hotter for a given radiation field, or if small pre-stellar
cores are more severely ionized in extreme starburst conditions.

importance in relation to a long standing intensive debate concerning the
(a)symmetry between the expanding and contracting phases in a recollapsing
universe. Furthermore, together with recent analogous results concerning a
bounce one can extend this monotonicity throughout an entire cycle. This
provides a strong motivation for employing the degree of squeezing as an
alternative measure of (quantum) entropy. It may also serve as a new concept of
emergent time described by a variable without classical analog. The evolution
of the squeezing in emergent oscillating scenarios can in principle provide
constraints on the viability of such models.

a characteristic Q(z) that in general varies with the redshift z but in those
models plays the role of a (constant) distinct parameter. Then, by
reconstructing dQ(z)/dz from observational data and comparing it with zero we
can assess the consistency between data and the models under consideration. For
a category of models that passes the test, we can further constrain the
distinct parameter of those models by reconstructing Q(z) from data. For
demonstration, in this paper we concentrate on quintessence. In particular we
examine the exponential potential and the power-law potential via a widely used
parametrization of the dark energy equation of state, w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z),
for data analysis. This method of the consistency test is particularly
efficient because for all models we invoke the constraint of only a single
parameter space that by choice can be easily accessed. The general principle of
our approach is not limited to dark energy. It may also be applied to the
testing of various cosmological models and even the models in other fields

using accretion--weighted histograms on a spherical surface of radius 0.2 Rvir
centred on the densest gas structure near the halo centre of mass, is a good
indicator of the presence of an accretion shock in the vicinity of the galactic

second measurement is performed by radially averaging histograms between 0.2

filaments: this is a good proxy for detecting cold streams feeding the central
galaxy. We define Mstream as the transition mass separating cold dominated from
hot dominated accretion in the outer halo, marking the disappearance of these
cold streams. We find a hot shock transition mass of Mshock=10^{11.6} Msun

that Mstream increases sharply with z. Our measurements are in agreement with

free-free opacity and recombination emission line spectra. In the case of a
spherically symmetric outflow that is isothermal and expanding at constant
radial speed, the radiative transfer for the continuum emission from a dense
wind is analytic. Even the emission profile shape for a recombination line can
be derived. Key to these derivations is that the opacity scales with only the
square of the density. These results are well-known. Here an extension of the
derivation is developed that also allows for line blends and the inclusion of
an additional power-law dependence beyond just the density dependence. The
additional power-law is promoted as a representation of a radius dependent
clumping factor. It is shown that differences in the line widths and equivalent
widths of the emission lines depend on the steepness of the clumping power-law.
Assuming relative level populations in LTE in the upper levels of He {\sc ii},
an illustrative application of the model to {\em Spitzer}/IRS spectral data of
the carbon-rich star WR 90 is given.

bandwidth, high spectral resolution, precise frequency calibration, and
ultrahigh detection sensitivity, all in one experimental platform based on an
optical frequency comb interacting with a high-finesse optical cavity. Precise
control of the optical frequency comb allows highly efficient, coherent
coupling of individual comb components with corresponding resonant modes of the
high-finesse cavity. The long cavity lifetime dramatically enhances the
effective interaction between the light field and intracavity matter,
increasing the sensitivity for measurement of optical losses by a factor that
is on the order of the cavity finesse. The use of low-dispersion mirrors
permits almost the entire spectral bandwidth of the frequency comb to be
employed for detection, covering a range of ~10% of the actual optical
frequency. The light transmitted from the cavity is spectrally resolved to
provide a multitude of detection channels with spectral resolutions ranging
from a several gigahertz to hundreds of kilohertz. In this review we will
discuss the principle of cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy and
the various implementations of such systems. In particular, we discuss several
types of UV, optical, and IR frequency comb sources and optical cavity designs
that can be used for specific spectroscopic applications. We present several
cavity-comb coupling methods to take advantage of the broad spectral bandwidth

a maximum as a function of energy of incident electron. We found analytically
the shape of the maximum for an exactly solvable model of circular-barrier
potential. Within a rescaling factor, this shape is universal for strong
potentials. If the repulsive potential has an attractive core, the discrete
levels of the core become quasilocal due to degeneracy with continuum. For
energy of incident electron close to the quasilocal state with zero angular
momentum, the enhancement of the net cross section is accompanied by resonant
enhancement of the skew scattering. By contrast, near the resonance with
quasilocal states having momenta $\pm 1$, the skew scattering cross section is
an odd function of energy deviation from the resonance, and passes through
zero, i.e., it exhibits a sign reversal. In the latter case, in the presence of

3sigma halos of cluster mass at z=0 have the same large-scale bias with respect

that within Gutzwiller mean-field theory spatially resolved calculations suffer
particularly from finite system sizes in the disordered case, while arithmetic
averaging of the order parameter cannot describe the Bose glass phase for
finite hopping $J>0$. Here we present and apply a new \emph{stochastic}
mean-field theory which captures localization due to disorder, includes
non-trivial dimensional effects beyond the mean-field scaling level and is
applicable in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to fermionic systems, we
find the existence of a critical hopping strength, above which the system
remains superfluid for arbitrarily strong disorder.

angular momentum due to their intense stellar winds. We investigate whether the
tidal interaction of a Wolf-Rayet star with a compact object in a binary system
can spin up the Wolf-Rayet star enough to produce a collapsar. We compute the
evolution of close Wolf-Rayet binaries, including tidal angular momentum
exchange, differential rotation of the Wolf-Rayet star, internal magnetic
fields, stellar wind mass loss, and mass transfer. The Wolf-Rayet companion is
approximated as a point mass. We then employ a population synthesis code to
infer the occurrence rates of the various relevant binary evolution channels.
We find that the simple scenario -- i.e., the Wolf-Rayet star being tidally
spun up and producing a collapsar -- does not occur at solar metallicity and
may only occur with low probability at low metallicity. It is limited by the
widening of the binary orbit induced by the strong Wolf-Rayet wind or by the
radius evolution of the Wolf-Rayet star that most often leads to a binary
merger. The tidal effects enhance the merger rate of Wolf-Rayet stars with
black holes such that it becomes comparable to the occurrence rate of long

have experienced a change in paradigm thanks to the discovery of large amounts

unlikely to be exactly equal they can still exhibit a high degree of

consistently negative. In such cases much of the similarity across covariance
matrices can be described by similarities in their principal axes, the axes
defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrices. Estimating the degree
of across-population eigenvector heterogeneity can be helpful for a variety of
estimation tasks. Eigenvector matrices can be pooled to form a central set of
principal axes, and to the extent that the axes are similar, covariance
estimates for populations having small sample sizes can be stabilized by
shrinking their principal axes towards the across-population center. To this
end, this article develops a hierarchical model and estimation procedure for
pooling principal axes across several populations. The model for the
across-group heterogeneity is based on a matrix-valued antipodally symmetric
Bingham distribution that can flexibly describe notions of ``center'' and
``spread'' for a population of orthonormal matrices.

alpha approx 1.2. We obtain the following results: a) We test the hypothesis
that the collapsing centers originate from locally Jeans-unstable
(""super-Jeans""), subsonic fragments; we find no such structures. b) We find
that the fraction of small-scale super-Jeans structures is larger in the
presence of self-gravity. c) The velocity divergence of subregions of the
simulations exhibits a negative correlation with their mean density. d) The
density probability density function (PDF) deviates from a lognormal in the
presence of self-gravity. e) Turbulence alone in the large-scale simulation
does not produce regions with the same size and mean density as those of the
small-scale simulation. Items (b)-(e) suggest that self-gravity is not only
involved in causing the collapse of Jeans-unstable density fluctuations
produced by the turbulence, but also in their {it formation}. We also measure
the star formation rate per free-fall time, as a function of Ms for the three
runs, and compare with the predictions of recent semi-analytical models. We
find marginal agreement to within the uncertainties of the measurements.
However, the hypotheses of those models neglect the net negative divergence of
dense regions we find in our simulations. We conclude that a) part of the
observed velocity dispersion in clumps must arise from clump-scale inwards
motions, and b) analytical models of clump and star formation need to take into
account this dynamical connection with the external flow and the fact that, in
the presence of self-gravity, the density PDF may deviate from a lognormal.

Gaussian ensemble. In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the
sparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general,
whenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with
overwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be
found by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for
any y. The recent work of Cand\'es, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of
the L_1 norm of x subject to A x = y results in the sparsest solution provided
the sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given
number of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the
dimension of x, the sparsity of x should be K < 0.239 N. Here, we consider the
case where x is d-block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N / d blocks where each
block is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector. Instead of L_1-norm
relaxation, we consider the following relaxation min x \| X_1 \|_2 + \| X_2
\|_2 + ... + \| X_n \|_2, subject to A x = y where X_i = (x_{(i-1)d+1},
x_{(i-1)d+2}, ..., x_{i d}) for i = 1,2, ..., N. Our main result is that as n

overwhelming probability in A, for any x whose block sparsity is k/n < 1/2 -
O(\epsilon), provided M/N > 1 - 1/d, and d = \Omega(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon).

SN2006gy. SN2006tf is valuable because it provides a link between two regimes:
(1) luminous type IIn supernovae powered by emission directly from interaction
with circumstellar material (CSM), and (2) the most extremely luminous SNe
where the CSM interaction is so optically thick that energy must diffuse out
from an opaque shocked shell. As SN2006tf evolves, it slowly transitions from
the second to the first regime as the clumpy shell becomes more porous. This
link suggests that the range in properties of the most luminous SNe is largely
determined by the density and speed of H-rich material ejected shortly before
they explode. The total energy radiated by SN2006tf was at least 7e50 ergs. If
the bulk of this luminosity came from the thermalization of shock kinetic
energy, then the star needs to have ejected ~18 Msun in the 4-8 yr before core
collapse, and another 2-6 Msun in the decades before that. A Type Ia explosion
is therefore excluded. From the H-alpha emission-line profile, we derive a
blast-wave speed of 2,000 km/s that does not decelerate, and from the narrow P
Cygni absorption from pre-shock gas we deduce that the progenitor's wind speed
was ~190 km/s. This is reminiscent of the wind speeds of LBVs, but not of RSGs
or WR stars. We propose that like SN2006gy, SN2006tf marked the death of a very
massive star that retained its H envelope until the end of its life, and
suffered extreme LBV-like mass loss in the decades before it exploded.

indefinite causal structure. Indefinite causal structure poses particular
problems for theory formulation since many of the core ideas used in the usual
approaches to theory construction depend on having definite causal structure.
For example, the notion of a state across space evolving in time requires that
we have some definite causal structure so we can define a state on a space-like
hypersurface. We will see that many of these problems are mitigated if we are
able to formulate the theory in a ""formalism local"" (or F-local) fashion. A
formulation of a physical theory is said to be F-local if, in making
predictions for any given arbitrary space-time region, we need only refer to
mathematical objects pertaining to that region. This is a desirable property
both on the grounds of efficiency and since, if we have indefinite causal
structure, it is not clear how to select some other space-time region on which
our calculations may depend. The usual ways of formulating physical theories
(the time evolving state picture, the histories approach, and the local
equations approach) are not F-local.
  We set up a framework for probabilistic theories with indefinite causal
structure. This, the causaloid framework, is F-local. We describe how Quantum
Theory can be formulated in the causaloid framework (in an F-local fashion).
This provides yet another formulation of Quantum Theory. This formulation,
however, may be particularly relevant to the problem of finding a theory of

in terms of approximately thermal states in the boundary CFT. The reflecting

completely. On the other hand, the formulation of the information paradox
becomes more stringent when a black hole is allowed to evaporate. In order to
address the information loss problem from the AdS/CFT perspective we then need
the boundary to become partially absorptive. We present a simple model that
produces the necessary changes on the boundary by coupling a bulk scalar field
to the evaporon, an external field propagating in one extra spatial dimension.
The interaction is localized at the boundary of AdS and leads to partial
transmission into the additional space. The transmission coefficient is
computed in the planar limit and perturbatively in the coupling constant.
Evaporation of the large black hole corresponds to cooling down the CFT by
transferring energy to an external sector.

have been made for the compressible plane Couette flow with three-dimensional
disturbances. The maximum amplification of perturbation energy over time,
$G_{\max}$, is found to increase with increasing Reynolds number ${\it Re}$,
but decreases with increasing Mach number $M$. More specifically, the optimal
energy amplification $G_{\rm opt}$ (the supremum of $G_{\max}$ over both the
streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers) is maximum in the incompressible limit and
decreases monotonically as $M$ increases. The corresponding optimal streamwise
wavenumber, $\alpha_{\rm opt}$, is non-zero at M=0, increases with increasing
$M$, reaching a maximum for some value of $M$ and then decreases, eventually
becoming zero at high Mach numbers. While the pure streamwise vortices are the
optimal patterns at high Mach numbers, the modulated streamwise vortices are
the optimal patterns for low-to-moderate values of the Mach number. Unlike in
incompressible shear flows, the streamwise-independent modes in the present
flow do not follow the scaling law $G(t/{\it Re}) \sim {\it Re}^2$, the reasons
for which are shown to be tied to the dominance of some terms in the linear
stability operator. Based on a detailed nonmodal energy analysis, we show that
the transient energy growth occurs due to the transfer of energy from the mean
flow to perturbations via an inviscid {\it algebraic} instability. The decrease
of transient growth with increasing Mach number is also shown to be tied to the
decrease in the energy transferred from the mean flow ($\dot{\mathcal E}_1$) in
the same limit.

approximation (strengthening and/or weakening) of a propositional
knowledge-base can be used to speed up query processing, at the expense of
completeness. In this classical approach, querying uses Horn over- and
under-approximations of a given knowledge-base, which is represented as a
propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Along with the class of
Horn functions, one could imagine other Boolean function classes that might
serve the same purpose, owing to attractive deduction-computational properties
similar to those of the Horn functions. Indeed, Zanuttini has suggested that
the class of affine Boolean functions could be useful in knowledge compilation
and has presented an affine approximation algorithm. Since CNF is awkward for
presenting affine functions, Zanuttini considers both a sets-of-models
representation and the use of modulo 2 congruence equations. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm based on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams
(ROBDDs). This leads to a representation which is more compact than the sets of
models and, once we have established some useful properties of affine Boolean
functions, a more efficient algorithm.

plane Couette flow are investigated for two prototype mean flows: (a) the {\it
uniform shear} flow with constant viscosity, and (b) the {\it non-uniform
shear} flow with {\it stratified} viscosity. Both mean flows are linearly
unstable for a range of supersonic Mach numbers ($M$). For a given $M$, the
critical Reynolds number ($Re$) is significantly smaller for the uniform shear
flow than its non-uniform shear counterpart. An analysis of perturbation energy
reveals that the instability is primarily caused by an excess transfer of
energy from mean-flow to perturbations. It is shown that the energy-transfer
from mean-flow occurs close to the moving top-wall for ``mode I'' instability,
whereas it occurs in the bulk of the flow domain for ``mode II''. For the
non-modal analysis, it is shown that the maximum amplification of perturbation
energy, $G_{\max}$, is significantly larger for the uniform shear case compared
to its non-uniform counterpart. For $\alpha=0$, the linear stability operator
can be partitioned into ${\cal L}\sim \bar{\cal L} + Re^2{\cal L}_p$, and the
$Re$-dependent operator ${\cal L}_p$ is shown to have a negligibly small
contribution to perturbation energy which is responsible for the validity of
the well-known quadratic-scaling law in uniform shear flow: $G(t/{\it Re}) \sim
{\it Re}^2$. A reduced inviscid model has been shown to capture all salient
features of transient energy growth of full viscous problem. For both modal and

matter particles in simulations, or galaxies in observations, one has to use
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for calculational efficiency. However, because of
the required mass assignment onto grid points in this method, the measured
power spectrum $\la |\delta^f(k)|^2\ra$ obtained with an FFT is not the true
power spectrum $P(k)$ but instead one that is convolved with a window function
$|W(\vec k)|^2$ in Fourier space. In a recent paper, Jing (2005) proposed an
elegant algorithm to deconvolve the sampling effects of the window function and
to extract the true power spectrum, and tests using N-body simulations show
that this algorithm works very well for the three most commonly used mass
assignment functions, i.e., the Nearest Grid Point (NGP), the Cloud In Cell
(CIC) and the Triangular Shaped Cloud (TSC) methods. In this paper, rather than
trying to deconvolve the sampling effects of the window function, we propose to
select a particular function in performing the mass assignment that can
minimize these effects. An ideal window function should fulfill the following
criteria: (i) compact top-hat like support in Fourier space to minimize the
sampling effects; (ii) compact support in real space to allow a fast and
computationally feasible mass assignment onto grids. We find that the scale
functions of Daubechies wavelet transformations are good candidates for such a
purpose. Our tests using data from the Millennium Simulation show that the true
power spectrum of dark matter can be accurately measured at a level better than
2% up to $k=0.7k_N$, without applying any deconvolution processes. The new
scheme is especially valuable for measurements of higher order statistics, e.g.

galaxies, we find that the two show nearly equal filamentarity. Separately
analyzing the galaxies with high star formation rates (SFR) and low SFR, we
find that the latter has a more filamentary distribution. We interpret this in

properties like luminosity with the high SFR galaxies being more luminous (2.)
A relation between the SFR and environmental effects like the density with the

cluster center . The temperature drops radially to 0.5-0.6 of the peak value at
a radius of \sim 15'. The gas-mass-weighted metal abundance averaged over the

CDFS (HST/ACS GOODS survey) and ground based near-IR $K_s$ images to derive the
evolution of the galaxy major merger rate in the redshift range $0.2 \leq z
\leq 1.2$. We select galaxies on the sole basis of their J-band rest-frame,
absolute magnitude, which is a good tracer of the stellar mass. We find steep
evolution with redshift, with the merger rate $\propto (1+z)^{3.43\pm0.49}$ for
optically selected pairs, and $\propto (1+z)^{2.18\pm0.18}$ for pairs selected
in the near-IR. Our result is unlikely to be affected by luminosity evolution
which is relatively modest when using rest-frame J band selection. The
apparently more rapid evolution that we find in the visible is likely caused by
biases relating to incompleteness and spatial resolution affecting the ground
based near IR photometry, underestimating pair counts at higher redshifts in
the near-IR. The major merger rate was $\sim$5.6 times higher at $z\sim1.2$
than at the current epoch. Overall 41%$\times$($0.5\gyr$/$\tau$) of all
galaxies with $M_J\leq-19.5$ have undergone a major merger in the last $\sim8
\gyr$, where $\tau$ is the merger timescale. Interestingly, we find no effect
on the derived major merger rate due to the presence of the large scale
structure at $z=0.735$ in the CDFS.

sequences of quantum gate operations, most often realized with single- and two-
qubit gates[1]. While such operations constitute a universal set for quantum
computation, gates acting on more than two qubits can simplify the
implementation of complex quantum algorithms[2]. Thus, a single three-qubit
operation can replace a complex sequence of two-qubit gates, which in turn
promises faster execution with potentially higher Fidelity. One important
three-qubit operation is the quantum Toffoli gate which performs a NOT
operation on a target qubit depending on the state of two control qubits. Here
we present the first experimental realization of the quantum Toffoli gate in an
ion trap quantum computer. Our implementation is particular effcient as we
directly encode the relevant logic information in the motion of the ion string.

  For QCD, we propose new sets of expansion parameters ${\bf w}_k(\as)$ that
reflect singularity at $\as=0 $ and should be used instead of powers $\as^k.$
Their explicit form is motivated by the so called Analytic Perturbation Theory.
These parameters reveal saturation in a strong coupling case at the level
$\as^{eff}(\as\gg1)={\bf w}_1(\as\gg 1) \sim 0.5 .$ They can be used for
quanitative analysis of divers low-energy amplitudes.
  We argue that this new picture with non-power sets of perturbation expansion

than could ever be achieved classically. Here we present a theory of the phase
sensitivity for the general case where the detection probability is given by an
$N$ photon interference fringe. We find that the phase sensitivity has a
complex dependence on both the intrinsic efficiency of detection $\eta$ and the
interference fringe visibility $V$. Most importantly, the phase that gives
maximum phase sensitivity is in general not the same as the phase at which the
slope of the interference fringe is a maximum, as has previously been assumed.
We determine the parameter range where quantum enhanced sensitivity can be
achieved. In order to illustrate these theoretical results, we perform a four
photon experiment with $\eta=3/4$ and $V=82\pm6$% (an extension of our previous
work [Science \textbf{316}, 726 (2007)]) and find a phase sensitivity 1.3 times
greater than the standard quantum limit at a phase different to that which
gives maximum slope of the interference fringe.

theoretically. Stars with multiple Blazhko periods or in which the Blazhko
effect itself varies are particularly challenging. This study investigates the
Blazhko effect in the RRc star LS Her. Detailed VRI CCD photometry has been
performed on 63 nights during six months. LS Her is confirmed to have a Blazhko
period of 12.75+/-0.02 days. However, where normally the side frequencies of
the Blazhko triplet are expected, an equidistant group of three frequencies is
found on both sides of the main pulsation frequency. As a consequence the
period and amplitude of the Blazhko effect itself vary in a cycle of 109+/-4
days. LS Her is a unique object turning out to be very important in the
verification of the theories for the Blazhko effect.

relation between the frequency spectra of the symmetric correlation and
response functions. When the system is not in the thermodinamic limit, this
result can be viewed as an extension of the fluctuation-dissipation relations
to a situation where dynamical fluctuations determine the response. Therefore,
the relation presented here between equilibrium fluctuations and response can
have a very different physical nature from the usual one in the canonical
ensemble. These considerations imply that the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
is not restricted to the context of thermal equilibrium, where it is usually
derived. Dispersion relations and sum rules are also obtained and discussed in
the present case. Although analogous to the Kramers-Kronig relations, they are
not related to the frequency spectrum but to the energy dependence of the

information for all vehicles in certain spatiotemporal regions. Velocity and
acceleration information cannot be extracted directly since the noise in the
NGSIM positional information is greatly increased by the necessary numerical
differentiations. We propose a smoothing algorithm for positions, velocities
and accelerations that can also be applied near the boundaries. The smoothing
time interval is estimated based on velocity time series and the variance of
the processed acceleration time series. The velocity information obtained in
this way is then applied to calculate the density function of the
two-dimensional distribution of velocity and inverse distance, and the density
of the distribution corresponding to the ``microscopic'' fundamental diagram.
Furthermore, it is used to calculate the distributions of time gaps and
times-to-collision, conditioned to several ranges of velocities and velocity
differences. By simulating virtual stationary detectors we show that the
probability for critical values of the times-to-collision is greatly
underestimated when estimated from single-vehicle data of stationary detectors.
Finally, we investigate the lane-changing process and formulate a quantitative
criterion for the duration of lane changes that is based on the trajectory
density in normalized coordinates. Remarkably, there is a very noisy but
significant velocity advantage in favor of the targeted lane that decreases
immediately before the change due to anticipatory accelerations.

is consistent with what is measured along translucent sightlines in the Galaxy.
The CO rotational excitation temperatures are higher than those measured in our

structure absorption lines, we show that this is a consequence of the
excitation being dominated by radiative pumping by the cosmic microwave

T_CMBR = 9.15 \pm 0.72 K, while 9.315 \pm 0.007 K is expected from the hot

electro-weak symmetry breaking inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Conformal symmetry is broken in the low-energy region near the IR brane by a
power-law departure from the pure AdS background. Such a modification--while
not spoiling the identification of the IR brane with the scale of confinement--
has a dramatic effect on both the coupling of the first composite states to the
standard model currents and their self-couplings. Chiral symmetry breaking can
take place at a scale larger than the IR cut-off. This study shows that
observables, such as the precision parameter $\hat{S}$, which depend on the
couplings of the lightest composite states to the currents are very sensitive
to the details of the dynamics in the low energy region where conformal
symmetry is lost and electro-weak symmetry is broken just above the scale of
confinement. Therefore results of calculations of these observables in AdS/CFT
inspired scenarios should be interpreted conservatively. The most important
phenomenological consequence for physics at the LHC is that the bound on the
mass scale of the heavy excitations (technirho mesons) in a realistic model is
in general lower than in the pure AdS background with a simple hard-wall cut
off in the IR.

characterize the radio continuum emission for a sample least affected by local

interacting samples can be compared. Radio continuum data at 325, 1420 and 4850
MHz were extracted from the WENSS, NVSS/FIRST and GB6 surveys, respectively. We
focus on the complete AMIGA subsample composed of 719 galaxies. Comparison
between the NVSS and FIRST detections indicates that the radio continuum is
coming from disk-dominated emission in spiral galaxies, in contrast to the
results found in high-density environments where nuclear activity is more
frequent. The comparison of the radio continuum power with a comparable sample,
which is however not selected with respect to its environment, the Condon et
al. UGC-SF sample of star-forming field galaxies, shows a lower mean value for
the AMIGA sample. We have obtained radio-to-optical flux ratios (R) using the
NVSS radio continuum flux. The distribution of R for the AMIGA galaxies is
consistent with a sample dominated by radio emission from star formation (SF)
and a small number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with less than 3% of the
sample with R > 100. We derived the radio luminosity function (RLF) and total
power density of the radio continuum emission for the AMIGA sample at 1.4 GHz,
and compared them with results from other low redshift studies. The Schechter
fit of the RLF indicates a major weight of the low-luminosity galaxies. The
results indicate the very low level of radio continuum emission in our sample
of isolated galaxies, which is dominated by mild disk SF. It confirms hence the
AMIGA sample as a suitable template to effectively quantify the role of
interactions in samples extracted from denser environments.

ordered phases, the static structure factors obtained by large-$N$ theory and
MC simulations for each lattice show quantitative agreement in the cooperative

assurance of security and Quality of Service (QoS), however, these features are
usually optional and supported by limited number of implementations. As a
result, the lack of mandatory and widely applicable QoS and security guaranties
makes the contemporary VoIP systems vulnerable to attacks and network

improves quality parameters of the call. SecMon is intended specially for VoIP
service over P2P networks and its main advantage is that it provides
authentication, data integrity services, adaptive QoS and (D)DoS attack

solution that is transparent to the users and possesses a self-organizing
capability. The above-mentioned features are accomplished mainly by utilizing
two information hiding techniques: digital audio watermarking and network
steganography. These techniques are used to create covert channels that serve
as transport channels for lightweight QoS measurement's results. Furthermore,
these metrics are aggregated in a reputation system that enables best route
path selection in the P2P network. The reputation system helps also to mitigate

stellar spiral potential in a local frame comoving with the stellar pattern.
Initially uniform gas rapidly separates into warm and cold phases as a result
of thermal instability (TI), and also forms a quasi-steady shock that prompts
phase transitions. After saturation, the flow follows a recurring cycle: warm
and cold phases in the interarm region are shocked and immediately cool to
become a denser cold medium in the arm; post-shock expansion reduces the mean
density to the unstable regime in the transition zone and TI subsequently
mediates evolution back into warm and cold interarm phases. For our standard
model with n_0 = 2 cm^-3, the gas resides in the dense arm, thermally-unstable
transition zone, and interarm region for 14%, 22%, 64% of the arm-to-arm
crossing time. These regions occupy 1%, 16%, and 83% of the arm-to-arm
distance, respectively. Gas at intermediate temperatures represents ~25-30% of
the total mass, similar to the fractions estimated from HI observations.
Despite transient features and multiphase structure, the time-averaged shock
profiles can be matched to that of a diffusive isothermal medium with
temperature 1,000 K and ""particle"" mean free path of l_0 = 100 pc. Finally, we
quantify numerical conductivity associated with translational motion of
phase-separated gas on the grid, and show that convergence of numerical results

physical conductivity. (Abridged)

factor is derived to transform the peak timeline signal to the interpolated 90

source flux detection limit at S/N $>5$ for a single detector row is
$1.1\pm0.1$ Jy which corresponds to a point source detection limit of the
survey of $\sim$0.4 Jy.
  Wavelet transform offers a multiscale representation of the Time Series Data
(TSD). We calculate the continuous wavelet transform of the TSD and then search
for significant wavelet coefficients considered as potential source detections.
To discriminate real sources from spurious or moving objects, only sources with
confirmation are selected. In our multiscale analysis, IRAS sources selected
above $4\sigma$ can be identified as the only real sources at the Point Source
Scales. We also investigate the correlation between the non-IRAS sources
detected in Timeline Analysis and cirrus emission using wavelet transform and
contour plots of wavelet power spectrum. It is shown that the non-IRAS sources
are most likely to be caused by excessive noise over a large range of spatial
scales rather than real extended structures such as cirrus clouds.

grouping of low density, warm, partially ionized clouds within about 15 pc of

most lines of sight and may be the cloud that immediately surrounds our Solar
System, the properties of which set the outer boundary conditions of the
heliosphere. Using absorption line data toward nearby stars, in situ
observations of inflowing interstellar gas from spacecraft in the Solar System,
and theoretical modeling of the interstellar radiation field and radiative
transfer, we can deduce many characteristics of the LIC. We find that the LIC
is partially ionized with modest electron density, n(e) ~ 0.07 cm^-3. The
combination of its temperature and ionization favor photoionization/thermal
equilibrium over a non-equilibrium cooling cloud picture. The abundances in the
LIC suggest moderate dust destruction for silicate dust but complete
destruction of carbonaceous grains. An origin for the LIC as a density
enhancement in the ambient medium that has been overrun by a shock seems
likely, while its velocity away from the Sco-Cen association points to a
possible connection to that region and the Loop I bubble.

that has already been successfully used in various fields. Several statistical
issues related to this model are studied. We first make a quick but extensive
review of their main properties and show that most of these properties can be
analytically studied. We then develop an approximation theory of these
processes in the limit of small intermittency $\lambda^2\ll 1$, i.e., when the
degree of multifractality is small. This allows us to prove that the
probability distributions associated with these processes possess some very
simple aggregation properties accross time scales. Such a control of the
process properties at different time scales, allows us to address the problem
of parameter estimation. We show that one has to distinguish two different
asymptotic regimes: the first one, referred to as the ''low frequency regime'',
corresponds to taking a sample whose overall size increases whereas the second
one, referred to as the ''high frequency regime'', corresponds to sampling the
process at an increasing sampling rate. We show that, the first regime leads to
convergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the situation is
much more intricate : only the intermittency coefficient $\lambda^2$ can be
estimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical
situations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency
versus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the estimations of the
other parameters are reliable or not. We finally illustrate how both our
results on parameter estimation and on aggregation properties, allow one to
successfully use these models for modelization and prediction of financial time
series.

crystalline phase. For this purpose we introduce a Gaussian parameterization of
the density profile and use it to minimize numerically the functional. We also
determine, from the analytic expression for the structure factor of the uniform
fluid, the bifurcation points from the nematic to the smectic and columnar
phases. The equation of state, as obtained from functional minimization, is
compared to the available Monte Carlo simulation. The agreement is is very
good, nearly perfect in the description of the inhomogeneous phases. The
columnar phase is found to be metastable with respect to the smectic or crystal
phases, its free energy though being very close to that of the stable phases.
This result justifies the observation of a window of stability of the columnar
phase in some simulations, which disappears as the size of the system
increases. The only important deviation between theory and simulations shows up
in the location of the nematic-smectic transition. This is the common drawback
of any fundamental measure functional of describing the uniform phase just with
the accuracy of scaled particle theory.

The interaction between electromagnetic radiation and these photoreceptors
(causing transitions between cis- and trans- states of rhodopsin molecules in
the latter) offers a prime example of physical processes at the nano-bio
interface. After a brief review of the basic facts about vision, we propose a
quantum mechanical model (paralleling the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) of
interaction of light with matter) of early vision describing the interaction of
light with the two states of rhodopsin mentioned above. Here we model the early
essential steps in vision incorporating, separately, the two well-known
features of retinal transduction (converting light to neural signals): small
numbers of cones respond to bright light (large number of photons) and large
numbers of rods respond to faint light (small number of photons) with an
amplification scheme. An outline of the method of solution of these respective
models based on quantum density matrix is also indicated. This includes a brief
overview of the theory, based on JCM, of signal amplification required for the
perception of faint light. We envision this methodology, which brings a novel
quantum approach to modeling neural activity, to be a useful paradigm in
developing a better understanding of key visual processes than is possible with
currently available models that completely ignore quantum effects at the
relevant neural level.

treating quantum lattice problems can likewise be reformulated in terms of MPS.
Thus, the latter constitute a common algebraic structure for both approaches.
We exploit this fact to compare the NRG approach for the single-impurity
Anderson model to a variational matrix product state approach (VMPS),
equivalent to single-site DMRG. For the latter, we use an ``unfolded'' Wilson
chain, which brings about a significant reduction in numerical costs compared
to those of NRG. We show that all NRG eigenstates (kept and discarded) can be
reproduced using VMPS, and compare the difference in truncation criteria, sharp
vs. smooth in energy space, of the two approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that
NRG results can be improved upon systematically by performing a variational
optimization in the space of variational matrix product states, using the
states produced by NRG as input.

models in which mass, a conserved quantity, is transferred stochastically
between sites. Condensation in such models is exhibited when above a critical
mass density the marginal distribution for the mass at a single site develops a
bump, $p_{\rm cond}(m)$, at large mass $m$. This bump corresponds to a
condensate site carrying a finite fraction of the mass in the system. Here, we
study the condensation transition from a different aspect, that of extreme
value statistics. We consider the cumulative distribution of the largest mass
in the system and compute its asymptotic behaviour. We show 3 distinct
behaviours: at subcritical densities the distribution is Gumbel; at the
critical density the distribution is Fr\'echet, and above the critical density
a different distribution emerges. We relate $p_{\rm cond}(m)$ to the
probability density of the largest mass in the system.

we construct the covariant version of these currents and verify that up to

we show that actually, for the fourth order current, no trace anomalies can

configuration of the Very Small Array (VSA), of a very deep decrement in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature. This decrement is located in the
direction of the Corona Borealis supercluster, at a position with no known
galaxy clusters, and was discovered by a previous VSA survey (Genova-Santos et
al.). A total area of 3 sq.deg. has now been imaged, with an angular resolution
of 7 arcmin and a flux sensitivity of 5 mJy/beam.
  These observations confirm the presence of this strong and resolved negative
spot at -41+/-5 mJy/beam (-258+/-29 muK), with a signal to noise level of 8.
This structure is also present in the WMAP 5-year data. The temperature of the
W-band (94 GHz) data at the position of the decrement agrees within 1.2-sigma
with that observed by the VSA at 33 GHz, and within 0.2-sigma with the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) spectrum.
  Our analyses show that it is a non-Gaussian feature in the CMB at a level of
4.8-sigma. The probability of finding such a deviation or larger in CMB
Gaussian simulations is only 0.19 per cent. Therefore, an explanation other
than primordial CMB is required. We have considered the possibility of an SZ
effect generated in a diffuse, extended warm/hot gas distribution. This
hypothesis is especially relevant, as the presence of such structures, if
confirmed, could provide the location for a significant fraction of the missing
baryons in the Local Universe.

different types collide, which has recently become important since string
theory can yield cosmic strings of distinct types. Using a model containing two
types of local U(1) string and stable composites, we simulate the collision of
two straight strings and investigate whether the dynamics matches that
previously obtained using the Nambu-Goto action, which is not strictly valid
close to the junction. We find that the Nambu-Goto action performs only
moderately well at predicting when the collision results in the formation of a
pair of Y-junctions (with a composite string connecting them). However, we find
that when they do form, the late time dynamics matches those of the Nambu-Goto
approximation very closely. We also see little radiative emission from the
Y-junction system, which suggests that radiative decay due to bridge formation
does not appear to be a means via which a cosmological network of such string
would rapidly lose energy.
