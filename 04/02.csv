begin with the classical case, and show that a classical two-copy expander can
be used to produce a quantum expander. We then discuss the quantum case and
give applications to the Solovay-Kitaev problem. We give probabilistic
constructions in both classical and quantum cases, giving tight bounds on the
expectation value of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue in the quantum case.

equations. They are compared to each other with respect to the locations of key
heliospheric boundary locations and with respect to the neutral hydrogen
content throughout the heliosphere. In many respects, the models' predictions
are similar. In particular, the locations of the termination shock agree to
within 7% in the nose direction and to within 14% in the downwind direction.
The nose locations of the heliopause agree to within 5%. The filtration of
neutral hydrogen from the interstellar medium into the inner heliosphere,
however, is model dependent, as are other neutral results including the
hydrogen wall. These differences are closely linked to the strength of the

powerlaw and a disc + powerlaw - were fitted to investigate the evolution of
the disc, along with a fixed gaussian component at 6.4 keV to investigate any
iron line in the spectrum. We show that the relative variation in flux and
X-ray colour between the two best sampled outbursts are very similar. The decay
of the disc temperature during the outburst is clearly seen in the soft state.
The expected decay is S_Disc \propto T^4; we measure T^4.75\pm0.23. This
implies that the inner disc radius is approximately constant in the soft state.
We also show a significant anti-correlation between the iron line significant
width and the X-ray flux in the soft state while in the hard state the EW is
independent of the flux. This results in hysteresis in the relation between
X-ray flux and both line flux and EW. To compare the X-ray binary outburst to
the behaviour seen in AGN, we construct a Disc Fraction Luminosity Diagram for

extension of the binary model that can treat the consequences of agreement

the continuum extension as an opportunity to develop rules for persistence of
opinion (memory). Rules governing the propagation of centrist views are also
examined. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out. We find that both memory
effects and the type of centrist significantly modify the variance of average
opinions in the large timescale limits of the models. Finally, we describe the
limit of applicability for Sznajd-Weron's model of binary opinions as the
continuum limit is approached. By comparing Monte Carlo results and long
time-step limits, we find that the opinion dynamics of binary models are
significantly different to those where agents are permitted more than 3

fitting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the velocity dispersion and
kurtosis profiles measured from the data. We demonstrate that when the sample
is cleaned of interlopers the data are consistent with the assumption that mass
follows light and isotropic stellar orbits with no need for an extended dark
matter halo. Our interloper removal scheme does not clean the data of
contamination completely, as demonstrated by the rotation curve of Leo I. When
moving away from the centre of the dwarf, the rotation appears to be reversed.
We interpret this behaviour using the results of an N-body simulation of a
dwarf galaxy possessing some intrinsic rotation, orbiting in the Milky Way
potential and show that it can be reproduced if the galaxy is viewed almost
along the tidal tails so that the leading (background) tail contaminates the
western part of Leo I while the trailing (foreground) tail the eastern one. We
show that this configuration leads to a symmetric and Gaussian distribution of
line-of-sight velocities. The simulation is also applied to test our modelling
method on mock data sets. We demonstrate that when the data are cleaned of
interlopers and the fourth velocity moment is used the true parameters of the
dwarf are typically within 1 \sigma errors of the best-fitting parameters.

tunneling particle spends purely imaginary time on a barrier region. The {\it
imaginary} time is associated with the stochastic acausal behaviour of a state,
while the {\it real} time is associated with the deterministic causal evolution
of a state. For the tunneling case the nonzero imaginary time is associated
with the transmission rate of the tunneling process, which is related to the
thickness of the barrier. The physical meaning of the zero real time is that
the particle instantly jumps from one side of the barrier to the other
regardless of the thickness. This leads to the illusion that tunneling
particles could actually travel faster than light. The results of recent
experiments in quantum optics concerning tunneling time can be thought of as
the first experimental confirmation of the existence of imaginary time.

theory of gravity. Space-time is generalized to space-time-momentum-energy and
both the principles of general covariance and equivalence are extended. The
theory is endowed with a Hermitian metric on a complex manifold. The Hermitian
metric contains, apart from the symmetric metric, an anti-symmetric part, which
describes dynamical torsion. The causality structure is changed in a way such
that there is a minimal time for events to be in causal contact and a maximal
radius for a non-local instantaneous causally related volume. The speed of
light can exceed the conventional speed of light in non-inertial frames and
accelerations are bounded. We have indications that the theory of Hermitian
gravity yields general relativity at large scales and a theory equivalent to
general relativity at very small scales, where the momenta and energies are
very large. As an example, we study cosmology in Hermitian gravity, where
matter is described by two scalar fields. While at late times Hermitian gravity
reproduces the standard cosmological FLRW models, at early times it differs
significantly: quite generically the Universe of Hermitian cosmology exhibits a
bounce where a maximal expansion rate (Ricci curvature) is attained. Moreover,
we prove that no cosmological constant is permitted at the classical level

particle is presumably in some kind of contact with the droplet surface)
compared to the immersion mode (particle immersed in the droplet). Many
heterogeneous centers have different nucleation thresholds when they act in
contact or immersion modes, indicating that the mechanisms may be actually
different for the different modes. Underlying physical reasons for this
enhancement have remained largely unclear. In this paper we present a model for
the thermodynamic enhancement of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in the
contact mode compared to the immersion one. To determine if and how the surface
of a liquid droplet can thermodynamically stimulate its heterogeneous
crystallization, we examine crystal nucleation in the immersion and contact
modes by deriving and comparing with each other the reversible works of
formation of crystal nuclei in these cases. As a numerical illustration, the
proposed model is applied to the heterogeneous nucleation of Ih crystals on
generic macroscopic foreign particles in water droplets at T=253 K. Our results
show that the droplet surface does thermodynamically favor the contact mode
over the immersion one. Surprisingly, our numerical evaluations suggest that
the line tension contribution to this enhancement from the contact of three
water phases (vapor-liquid-crystal) may be of the same order of magnitude as or
even larger than the surface tension contribution.

We assume that repair of post-replication mismatched base-pairs occurs with
probability $ \lambda $, and that the SOS response is triggered when the total

analytically solvable in the limit of infinite sequence length. The results,
which are confirmed by stochastic simulations, indicate that the SOS response
does indeed confer a fitness advantage to a population, provided that it is

galactic center and achieve a constant velocity from the core to the periphery.
This dynamic behavior is described by models balancing Newtonian gravitational
and centrifugal forces in rotating thin axisymmetric disks. Freeman's disk
assumes a mass density decreasing exponentially with radius which correctly
produces rotational velocities which increase from the galactic center to a
maximum near the outer core, but then decreases out to the periphery contrary
to measurements. Mestel's disk assumes a mass distribution decreasing more
slowly (inversely with radius) that yields a constant rotational velocity
across the entire disk, but has an unrealistic central mass singularity and
does not describe the core rotation properly. Thus combine the Freeman and
Mestel disks to utilize their strengths and eliminate their deficiencies.
Utilize the Freeman formula for the central core, and the Mestel formula beyond
the core to the galactic rim. This combined model produces rotation curves
comparable to the measurements of mature spiral galaxies. For a more general
thin-disk model, we develop an alternative computational method to solve for
the mass density distributions for various measured rotation curves We compute
radial mass densities that balance the Newtonian gravitational and centrifugal
forces at every point. The computational solutions show mass densities which
decrease approximately exponentially in the central core (similar to Freeman),
and transition to a slower inverse radial decrease (similar to Mestel) to the
periphery. Thus these diverse approaches yield similar results and are mutaully
self-consistent with Newtonian gravity/dynamics.

and N V appear in the high-state spectra (July 2004) at v_shift=-250 km/s
(system A_h) and at v_shift=-840 km/s (system B). The absence of absorption
from the low metastable levels of Si II implies a density <~10^3 cm^(-3) for
system A_l, indicating a location outside the narrow line region (NLR). System
A_h is peculiar as only N V absorption is clearly detected. A high N V/C IV
absorption ratio is expected for a high metallicity absorber, but this is
excluded here as the metallicity of the host galaxy and of the nuclear gas is
significantly subsolar. A simple acceptable model for systems A_h and B is an
absorber located between the broad line region (BLR) and the NLR, which absorbs
only the continuum and the BLR. At the low-state the strong narrow emission
lines of C IV and N V dominate the spectrum, making the absorption invisible.
At the high-state the absorbed continuum and BLR emission dominate the
spectrum. Thus, the change in the observed absorption does not reflect a change
in the absorber, but rather a change in the continuum and BLR emission from
behind the absorber, relative to the emission from the NLR in front of the
absorber. Studies of the absorption line variability in highly variable objects
can thus break the degeneracy in the absorber distance determination inherent
to single epoch studies.

small $\delta t$, however, the resulting $\delta\omega$ shift lies beneath the
Heisenberg frequency uncertainty. And since there {\it is} a way of telling
whether such short term shifts really exist, if the answer is affirmative we
will have a means of monitoring radiation to an accuracy level that surpasses
fundamental limitations. More elaborately, had $\omega$ been `frozen' for a
minimum threshold interval before any redshift could take place, i.e. the light
propagated as a smooth but {\it periodic} sequence of wave packets or pulses,
and $\omega$ decreased only from one pulse to the next, one would then be
denied the above forbiddingly precise information about frequency behavior. Yet
because this threshold period is {\it observable}, being $\Delta t \approx
1/\sqrt{\omega_0 H_0} \sim$ 5 -- 15 minute for the cosmic microwave background

extensions of positive definite linear operators, but also as natural
extensions of gradients of convex potentials. These vector fields are not
always derived from potentials in the classical sense, and as such they are not
always amenable to the standard methods of the calculus of variations. We
describe here how the selfdual variational calculus developed recently by the
author, provides a variational approach to PDEs and evolution equations driven
by maximal monotone operators. To any such a vector field T on a reflexive
Banach space X, one can associate a convex selfdual Lagrangian L_T on phase
space X x X* that can be seen as a ""potential"" for T, in the sense that the
problem of inverting T reduces to minimizing the convex energy L_T. This
variational approach to maximal monotone operators allows their theory to be
analyzed with the full range of methods --computational or not-- that are
available for variational settings. Standard convex analysis (on phase space)
can then be used to establish many old and new results concerned with the
identification, superposition, and resolution of such vector fields.

different signatures on the power spectrum and correlation function of matter

proposed as means to determine the equation of state of the dark energy. The
accuracy required to achieve competitive constraints demands an extremely good
understanding of systematic effects which change the baryonic acoustic
oscillation (BAO) imprint. We use 50 very large volume N-body simulations to
investigate the BAO signature in the two-point correlation function. The
location of the BAO bump does not correspond to the sound horizon scale at the
level of accuracy required by future measurements, even before any dynamical or
statistical effects are considered. Careful modelling of the correlation
function is therefore required to extract the cosmological information encoded
on large scales. We find that the correlation function is less affected by
scale dependent effects than the power spectrum. We show that a model for the
correlation function proposed by Crocce & Scoccimarro (2008), based on
renormalised perturbation theory, gives an essentially unbiased measurement of
the dark energy equation of state. This means that information from the large
scale shape of the correlation function, in addition to the form of the BAO
peak, can be used to provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters. The
correlation function therefore provides a better constraint on the distance
scale (~50% smaller errors with no systematic bias) than the more conservative
approach required when using the power spectrum (i.e. which requires amplitude

bosons, when the bosons occupy significantly only few modes. The approach is
based on an analogy with the dynamics of a single particle of either positive
or negative mass in a quantum potential, where the inverse number of bosons
plays the role of Planck constant. As application of the method we consider the
Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well trap. The ground state of positive
mass particle corresponds to the mean-field fixed point of lower energy, while
that of negative mass to the excited fixed point. In the case of attractive BEC
above the threshold for symmetry breaking, the ground state is a cat state and
we relate this fact to the double-well shape of the quantum potential for the
positive mass quantum particle. The tunneling energy splitting between the
local Fock states of the cat state is shown to be extremely small for the
nonlinearity parameter just above the critical value and exponentially
decreasing with the number of atoms. In the repulsive case, the phase locked
($\pi$-phase) macroscopic quantum self-trapping of BEC is related to the
double-well structure of the potential for the negative mass quantum particle.
We also analyze the running phase macroscopic quantum self-trapping state and
show that it is subject to quantum collapses and revivals. Moreover, the
quantum dynamics just before the first collapse of the running phase shows
exponential growth of dispersion of the quantum phase distribution which may
explain the growth of the phase fluctuations seen in the experiment on the
macroscopic quantum self-trapping.

chosen which together represent relatively young as well as older populations
of stars: 9 open cluster white dwarfs, 22 high mass field white dwarfs, and 17
metal-rich field white dwarfs. In particular, these targets include: 7 Hyads

at 34 of the sample white dwarfs, 20 of which have limits below 10 $M_{\rm J}$

rotation-induced and SASI-induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations. In
the rotating model, multi-angle transport predicts much larger asymptotic
neutrino flux asymmetries with pole to equator ratios of up to ~2.5, while
MGFLD tends to sphericize the radiation fields already in the optically
semi-transparent postshock regions. Along the poles, the multi-angle
calculation predicts a dramatic enhancement of the neutrino heating by up to a
factor of 3, which alters the postbounce evolution and results in greater polar
shock radii and an earlier onset of the initially rotationally weakened SASI.
In the nonrotating model, differences between multi-angle and MGFLD
calculations remain small at early times when the postshock region does not
depart significantly from spherical symmetry. At later times, however, the
growing SASI leads to large-scale asymmetries and the multi-angle calculation
predicts up to 30% higher average integral neutrino energy deposition rates

investigate optical forbidden lines along the LkHa 233 jet to determine
physical parameters of this jet (electron density n_e, hydrogen ionisation
fraction x_e, electron temperature T_e, and mass density n_H). The knowledge of
these parameters allows us a direct comparison of a jet from a Herbig star with
those from T Tauri stars. The WFPC2 images in broad-band filters clearly show a
dark lane caused either by a circumstellar disk or a dust torus. In the
blueshifted lobe, n_e is close to or above the critical density for [SII] lines
(2.5x10^4 cm^-3) in the first arcsecond and decreases with distance from the
source. The ionisation x_e~0.2-0.6 gently rises for the first 500 AU of the
flow and shows two re-ionisation events further away from the origin. The T_e
varies along the flow between 10^4 K and 3x10^4 K. The (radial) outflow
velocities are ~ 80-160 km s^(-1), and they appear to increase with distance
from the source. In the redshifted lobe, T_e, n_e, x_e, and n_H are all lower
than in the blueshifted lobe, but have the same order of magnitude. All these
derived parameters are just beyond or at the upper limits of those observed for

us to reformulate any linear equation, as well as certain nonlinear ones (e.g.
Hartree and cubic non-linear Schr\""odinger), as coarse-scale phase-space
equations (e.g. smoothed Vlasov), with spatial and spectral resolutions

J=3-2, and (13)CO J=2-1 line observations in a 4'x4' field around the ring
nebula G79.29+0.46, which is illuminated by a strong candidate to LBV star. The
whole field shows extended predominant emission in both CO and (13)CO J=2-1
lines, which probably comes from the large cloud which contains the star
forming region DR15. When this large-scale emission is removed, minor scales
features become evident, particularly in the CO J=3-2 line, strikingly
coincident with the ring nebula. The high critical density of CO J=3-2 (some
10^4 cm^(-3)) gives additional support for the association with the massive
star, since high density molecular gas has more chances to survive in such a
harsh environment. This structure may have been produced by the cumulative
effect of a strong steady wind in the LBV stage or earlier, which has
compressed the surviving parent molecular cloud. In addition, immersed within
this CO feature, we have also discovered a higher density clump (at least
several 10^5 cm^(-3)), unresolved by the telescope and probably having a higher
kinetic temperature. Towards the clump, the presence of a jump of 14-16 km/s in
the gas velocity may indicate the existence of a shockfront. This clump may
have been created by at least one mass eruption, 10^3 - 10^4 yr ago. Thus, this
work shows that not all the molecular gas is destroyed during massive star
evolution, and consequently we are dealing with a new laboratory where one can
learn about the mass-loss phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.

usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability

sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof
theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show
that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the
elementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in
the underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result
extends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the
decidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the
decidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory. Although
various researchers have reported similar results for individual cases, our

the ionization level of the IGM during reionization. In order to avoid biasing
parameter estimates, an accurate and model independent approach to reionization
is needed when analyzing high precision data, like those expected from the
Planck experiment. In this paper we consider two recently proposed methods of
fitting for reionization and we discuss their respective advantages. We test
both methods by performing a MonteCarlo Markov Chain analysis of simulated
Planck data, assuming different fiducial reionization histories. We take into
account both temperature and polarization data up to high multipoles, and we
fit for both reionization and non reionization parameters. We find that while a
wrong assumption on reionization may bias \tau_e, A_s and r by 1-3 standard
deviations, other parameters, in particular n_s, are not significantly biased.
The additional reionization parameters introduced by considering the model
independent methods do not affect the accuracy of the estimates of the main
cosmological parameters, the biggest degradation being of order ~ 15% for
\tau_e. Finally, we show that neglecting Helium contribution in the analysis
increases the bias on \tau_e, r and A_s even when a general fitting approach to
reionization is assumed.

of a magnetic field and coupled to a heat bath through different coupling
schemes is obtained analytically. It is shown that finite dissipation
substitutes the zero-coupling result of exponential decay of entropy by a power
law behaviour at low temperature. For the coordinate-coordinates coupling
scheme the low temperature explicit results for the case of Ohmic,
exponentially correlated and more generalized heat bath models are derived. In
all the above mentioned cases free energy and entropy vanish linearly with
temperature ($T$) as $T\to 0$ in conformity with Nernst's theorem. It is seen
that coordinate (velocity)-velocities (coordinates) coupling is much more
beneficial than the coordinate-coordinates coupling to ensure third law of
thermodynamics. The case of radiation heat bath shows $T^3$ decay behaviour for
entropy as $T\to 0$. It is observed that at low temperature free energy and
entropy decay faster for the velocity-velocities scheme than any other coupling
schemes. This implies velocity-velocities coupling scheme is the most
advantageous coupling scheme in restoring the third law of thermodynamics. It
is shown that the low temperature thermodynamic functions are independent of
magnetic field for all the above mentioned cases except the without dissipation
case.

the orbital frequency, leading to an estimate of the binary inclination angle

to indirectly derive a mass ratio of q= 0.6 and a radial velocity
semi-amplitude of the white dwarf of K_1 = 101+/-3 km/s. We present an
atmospheric temperature indicator, based on the absorption line ratio of Fe I
and Cr I lines, whose variation indicates that the secondary star varies from
K0 to K4 as a function of orbital phase. The ephemeris of the system has been
revised, using more than one thousand radial velocity measurements, published
over nearly five decades. From the derived radial velocity semi-amplitudes and
the estimated inclination angle, we calculate that the masses of the stars are
M_1 = 0.63+/-0.05M_sun; M_2 = 0.37+/-0.04 M_sun, and their separation is a =
2.33+/-0.02R_sun. Our analysis indicates the presence of a late-type star whose
radius is larger, by a factor of nearly two, than the radius of a normal main
sequence star of its mass. Finally we discuss the possibility that the measured

shells in such a background are also analyzed. First a derivation of the
equation of motion of such a shell in a $d$-dimensional spacetime is given.
Then a proof of the cosmic censorship conjecture in a charged collapsing
framework is presented, and a useful constraint which leads to an upper bound
for the rest mass of a charged shell with an empty interior is derived. It is
also proved that a shell with total mass equal to charge, i.e., an extremal
shell, in an empty interior, can only stay in neutral equilibrium outside its
gravitational radius. This implies that it is not possible to generate a
regular extremal black hole by placing an extremal dust thin shell within its
own gravitational radius. Moreover, it is shown, for an empty interior, that
the rest mass of the shell is limited from above. Then several types of
behavior of oscillatory charged shells are studied. In the presence of a
horizon, it is shown that an oscillatory shell always enters the horizon and
reemerges in a new asymptotically flat region of the extended
Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime. On the other hand, for an overcharged interior,
i.e., a shell with no horizons, an example showing that the shell can achieve a
stable equilibrium position is presented. The results presented have
applications in brane scenarios with extra large dimensions, where the creation
of tiny higher dimensional charged black holes in current particle accelerators

the most X-ray luminous clusters found at z~0.3 in the REFLEX cluster survey
and observed with XMM-Newton. These systems (RXCJ0014.3-3022, RXCJ0232.2-4420,
and RXCJ2308.3-0211) are in different dynamical states, as witnessed by their
X-ray morphology and optical appearence (e.g. multiplicity of BCGs). [Abridged]
Diffuse stellar emission is robustly detected down to a surface brightness of
26 R-mag/arcsec^2 (observed frame) around a total of seven BCGs, extending up
to galactocentric distances of ~100 kpc. In particular, it surrounds a pair of
BCGs in RXCJ0232.2-4420, while it bridges two BCGs associated with the minor
subcomponent of the merging cluster RXCJ0014.3-3022. The diffuse light detected
at the greatest distances from the BCGs of the rather regular clusters
RXCJ0232.2-4420 and RXCJ2308.3-0211 follows the ICM distribution. Its B-R
colour is consistent with the colours measured within the BCG effective radii.
The diffuse light around the two pairs of BCGs in RXCJ0014.3-3022 exhibits
bluer colours than the BCG central regions by up to 0.5 mag. If the
contribution of the intracluster light (ICL) to the detected diffuse light
around BCGs is not negligible, ICL and BCGs have similar stellar populations in
relatively relaxed clusters. Merging on a cluster scale eventually adds
gravitational stresses to BCGs and other galaxies in subcluster cores. This
event may affect the properties of the diffuse stellar emission around BCGs.
Shredding of star-forming, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies is favoured as the
cause of the bluer B-R colours of the diffuse stellar component around the two
pairs of BCGs in the merging cluster RXCJ0014.3-3022.

underlying method uses the Boltzmann transport equation that describes neutral
transport, and is coupled to plasma protons predominantly through charge
exchange processes. The gyrotropic distribution function of the neutrals is
first expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials followed by associated Laguerre
harmonics. The resulting set of equations can be cast into a square matrix
whose eigenvalues depend upon sources and the plasma distribution. The
interstellar protons, in a high $\beta$ limit, are described by a hydrodynamic
fluid with source terms that couple neutrals and plasma and further modify both
distributions in a self-consistent manner.

based on a gateable single dot photodiode structure that can be switched

we propose to employ a spin-conditional absorption of a circularly polarized
light pulse tuned to the single negatively charged exciton transition to
convert the spin information of the resident electron to charge occupancy.
Switching the device to the charge readout mode then allows us to probe the
charge state of the quantum dot (1e, 2e) using non-resonant luminescence. The
spin orientation of the resident electron is then reflected by the
photoluminescence yield of doubly and singly charged transitions in the quantum
dot. To verify the feasibility of this spin readout concept, we have applied
time gated photoluminescence to confirm that selective optical charging and
efficient non perturbative measurement of the charge state can be performed on
the same dot. The results show that, by switching the electric field in the
vicinity of the quantum dot, the charging rate can be switched between a regime
of efficient electron generation and a readout regime, where the charge
occupancy and, therefore, the spin state of the dot can be tested via PL over
millisecond timescales, without altering it.

processes is likely to adversely affect the outcome of the entire process. Most
biomedical entity relationship extraction tools have used biomedical-specific
parts-of-speech (POS) tagger as errors in POS tagging and are likely to affect
subsequent semantic analysis of the text, such as shallow parsing. This study
aims to evaluate the parts-of-speech (POS) tagging accuracy and attempts to
explore whether a comparable performance is obtained when a generic POS tagger,
MontyTagger, was used in place of MedPost, a tagger trained in biomedical text.
Our results demonstrated that MontyTagger, Muscorian's POS tagger, has a POS
tagging accuracy of 83.1% when tested on biomedical text. Replacing MontyTagger
with MedPost did not result in a significant improvement in entity relationship
extraction from text; precision of 55.6% from MontyTagger versus 56.8% from
MedPost on directional relationships and 86.1% from MontyTagger compared to
81.8% from MedPost on nondirectional relationships. This is unexpected as the
potential for poor POS tagging by MontyTagger is likely to affect the outcome
of the information extraction. An analysis of POS tagging errors demonstrated
that 78.5% of tagging errors are being compensated by shallow parsing. Thus,
despite 83.1% tagging accuracy, MontyTagger has a functional tagging accuracy
of 94.6%.

remaining unresolved X-ray emission is characterized by an emissivity per unit
stellar mass L_x/M_stars ~8.2x10^{27} erg/s/M_sun in the 0.5-2 keV energy band.
This value is in good agreement with those previousely determined for the dwarf
elliptical galaxy M32, the bulge of the spiral galaxy M31 and the Milky Way, as
well as with the integrated X-ray emissivity of cataclysmic variables and
coronally active binaries in the Solar neighborhood. This strongly suggests
that i) the bulk of the unresolved X-ray emission in NGC 3379 is produced by

probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are
important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and
engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large
fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory.
In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large
deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine
and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and
other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in
an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is
the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents
the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical
applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The
second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics,
and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large
deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of
physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed
dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems,
and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of
statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles
characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the
Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of
nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.

great deal of interest, namely the investigation on the irreducible nonlocal
properties of Nature implied by quantum entanglement and the physical
realization of the 'Schroedinger Cat'. In the present work a macro - state
consisting of about 3.5 x 10^4 photons in a quantum superposition and entangled
with a far apart single - photon state is generated. Then, the non-separability
of the overall micro-macro system is demonstrated and the corresponding Bell's
inequalities are found to be violated. Precisely, an entangled photon pair is
created by a nonlinear optical process, then one photon of the pair is injected
into an optical parametric amplifier operating for any input polarization
state, i.e. into a phase-covariant cloning machine. Such transformation
establishes a connection between the single photon and the multi particle
fields. We then demonstrate the non-separability of the bipartite system by
adopting a local filtering technique within a positive operator valued
measurement.

regular and adjoint eigenvectors that are solutions to the linear-oscillations

  Results: We determine the time evolution of both the amplitude and kinetic

Because the eigenperiods ratio is close to 1/2, we discover that the nonlinear

galaxy interactions and their effects on the evolution of galaxies. In
particular, dynamically young systems, with a large fraction of interacting,
late type galaxies, have so far escaped proper studies in the X-ray band and
their hot intergalactic medium properties are virtually unknown. Motivated by
this lack of knowledge, we present a detailed investigation here of the X-ray
properties of such a dynamically young system. METHODS: We obtained XMM-Newton
observations of one spiral-only system in the new southern compact group
catalogue: SCG0018-4854. We present here the results of the data analysis and
discuss them in comparison with the few other similar systems also studied in
the X-ray band. RESULTS: The 4 members of SCG0018-4854 emit at a level
comparable to what is expected based on their optical properties. We detect the
low level diffuse emission between galaxies, which is most likely due to the
presence of the intergalactic medium. Compared to other spiral--only groups,
this could be the coolest system detected so far, although the measurements
have large uncertainties. These results indicate that high quality deep X-ray
observations are needed to allow a proper study of the properties of the
potential well of dynamically young systems, before more general conclusions
can be drawn on their average characteristics.

system with the electromagnetic field in its vacuum state and, solving the
dynamical problem, we have analyzed the amount of entanglement induced in the
bipartite system (atom + cavity mode) by the common electromagnetic reservoir.
This has allowed us to quantitatively characterize the regime under which
field-induced cooperative effects are not vanished by dissipation. Once the
Decoherence Free Regime is reached, transient entanglement tends to become
stationary and, therefore, usable for quantum gate implementation.

following a start-up of flow in a semi-dilute wormlike micellar system

the building of the banding structure, we observed the stages of formation,
migration of the interface between bands and finally the destabilization of
this interface along the vorticity axis. The mechanical signature of these
processes has been indentified in the time series of the shear stress. The
interface instability occurs all along the stress plateau, the asymptotic
wavelength of the patterns increasing with the control parameter typically from
a fraction of the gap width to about four times the gap width. Three main
regimes of dynamics are highlighted : a spatially stable oscillating mode
approximately at the middle of the coexistence region flanked by two ranges
where the dynamics appears more exotic with propagative and chaotic events
respectively at low and high shear rates. The distribution of small particles
seeded in the solution strongly suggests that the flow is three-dimensional.
Finally, we demonstrate that the shear-banding scenario described in this paper
is not specific to our system.

graphene nanoribbons with a magnetic barrier on top is presented. The magnetic
barrier modifies the energy spectrum of the nanoribbons locally, which results
in an energy shift of the conductance steps towards higher energies. The
magnetic barrier also induces Fabry-Perot type oscillations, provided the edges
of the barrier are sufficiently sharp. The lowest propagating state present in
zigzag and metallic armchair nanoribbons prevent confinement of the charge
carriers by the magnetic barrier. Disordered edges in nanoribbons tend to
localize the lowest propagating state, which get delocalized in the magnetic
barrier region. Thus, in sharp contrast to the case of two-dimensional
graphene, the charge carriers in graphene nanoribbons cannot be confined by
magnetic barriers. We also present a novel method based on the Green's function
technique for the calculation of the magnetosubband structure, Bloch states and
magnetoconductance of the graphene nanoribbons in a perpendicular magnetic
field. Utilization of this method greatly facilitates the conductance
calculations, because, in contrast to excising methods, the present method does
not require self-consistent calculations for the surface Green's function.

structural models turn out metallic, hence the dielectric functions contain
interband and intraband free electron contributions. The former are calculated

The existence of a dynamical potential with both local and global meanings in
general nonequilibrium processes has been controversial. Following an earlier
explicit construction by one of us (Ao, J. Phys. {\bf A37}, L25 '04,
arXiv:0803.4356, referred to as SDS II), in the present paper we show
rigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and
biological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is
demonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global
steady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of Fokker-Planck equation,
the zero mass limit. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic
differential equation for any given Fokker-Planck equation. No detailed balance
condition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a
formula to describe the noise induced shift in drift force comparing to the
steady state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical
studies. The comparison to two well known stochastic integration methods, Ito
and Stratonovich, are made ready. Such comparison was made elsewhere (Ao, Phys.
