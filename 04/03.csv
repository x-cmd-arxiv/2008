coincidence problem. But interacting dark energy models can suffer from
pathologies. We consider the case where the dark energy is modelled as a fluid
with constant equation of state parameter w. Non-interacting constant-w models
are well behaved in the background and in the perturbed universe. But the
combination of constant w and a simple interaction with dark matter leads to an
instability in the dark sector perturbations at early times: the curvature
perturbation blows up on super-Hubble scales. Our results underline how
important it is to carefully analyze the relativistic perturbations when
considering models of coupled dark energy. The instability that we find has
been missed in some previous work where the perturbations were not consistently
treated. The unstable mode dominates even if adiabatic initial conditions are
used. The instability also arises regardless of how weak the coupling is. This
non-adiabatic instability is different from previously discovered adiabatic
instabilities on small scales in the strong-coupling regime.

nebula around Eta Carinae in the near-infrared spectral region (J band). We
confirmed the presence of a hole on the polar region of each lobe, as indicated
by previous near-IR long-slit spectra and mid-IR images. The holes can be
described as a cylinder of height (i.e. the thickness of the lobe) and diameter
of 6.5 and 6.0x10^{16} cm, respectively. We also mapped the blue-shifted
component of He I 10830 seen towards the NW lobe. Contrary to previous works,
we suggested that this blue-shifted component is not related to the Paddle but
it is indeed in the equatorial disc.
  We confirmed the claim of Smith (2005) and showed that the spatial extent of
the Little Homunculus matches remarkably well the radio continuum emission at 3
cm, indicating that the Little Homunculus can be regarded as a small HII
region. Therefore, we used the optically-thin 1.3 mm radio flux to derive a
lower limit for the number of Lyman-continuum photons of the central source in
Eta Car. In the context of a binary system, and assuming that the ionising flux
comes entirely from the hot companion star, the lower limit for its spectral
type and luminosity class ranges from O5.5 III to O7 I. Moreover, we showed
that the radio peak at 1.7 arcsec NW from the central star is in the same
line-of-sight of the `Sr-filament' but they are obviously spatially separated,
while the blue-shifted component of He I 10830 may be related to the radio peak
and can be explained by the ultraviolet radiation from the companion star.

study of such transient dynamics. In particular, we focus on the analysis of
whether one component of a solution to a system of differential equations can
overtake the corresponding component of a reference solution, given that both
solutions approach the same stable node. We call this phenomenon tolerance,
which derives from a certain biological effect. Here, we establish certain
general conditions, based on the initial conditions associated with the two
solutions and the properties of the vector field, that guarantee that tolerance
does or does not occur in two-dimensional systems. We illustrate these
conditions in particular examples, and we derive and demonstrate additional
techniques that can be used on a case by case basis to check for tolerance.
Finally, we give a full rigorous analysis of tolerance in two-dimensional
linear systems.

Einstein's geometric theory of gravity. This Regge Calculus (RC) is strikingly
different from the more usual finite difference and finite element
discretizations of gravity. In RC the fundamental principles of General
Relativity are applied directly to a tessellated spacetime geometry. In this
manuscript, and in the spirit of this conference, we reexamine the foundations
of RC and emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay lattices
play in this discrete theory. In particular we describe, for the first time, a
geometric construction of the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This
derivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements
inherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric
dual (Voronoi) lattice. The orthogonality properties between these two lattices
yield an expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is strikingly
similar to the corresponding and more familiar hinge-based expression in RC
(deficit angle per unit Voronoi dual area). In particular, we show that the
scalar curvature is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per
weighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us is how naturally
spacetime is represented by Voronoi and Delaunay structures and that the laws
of gravity appear to be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less
complexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is recovered by convergence
in mean. Perhaps these prominent features may enable us to transcend the
details of any particular discrete model gravitation and yield clues to help us
discover how we may begin to quantize this fundamental interaction.

on the capacity region is developed using cutset bounds. An achievable rate
region is obtained for the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. It is shown that
for every choice of input distribution, the rate regions for the inner (DF) and
outer bounds are given by the intersection of two K-dimensional polymatroids,
one resulting from the multiaccess link at the relay and the other from that at
the destination. Although the inner and outer bound rate regions are not
identical in general, for both cases, a classical result on the intersection of
two polymatroids is used to show that the intersection belongs to either the
set of active cases or inactive cases, where the two bounds on the K-user
sum-rate are active or inactive, respectively. It is shown that DF achieves the
capacity region for a class of degraded Gaussian MARCs in which the relay has a
high SNR link to the destination relative to the multiaccess link from the
sources to the relay. Otherwise, DF is shown to achieve the sum-capacity for an
active class of degraded Gaussian MARCs for which the DF sum-rate is maximized
by a polymatroid intersection belonging to the set of active cases. This class
is shown to include the class of symmetric Gaussian MARCs where all users

to the formation of `bijels': bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels.

that bijels can also be formed in volumetrically asymmetric quenches. Here we
present new simulation results for such quenches, compare these to the
symmetric case, and find a crossover to an arrested droplet phase at strong
asymmetry. We then make extensive new analyses of the post-arrest dynamics in
our simulated bijel and droplet structures, on time scales comparable to the
Brownian time for colloid motion. Our results suggest that, on these

when the model reduces to weakly coupled chains, the two show dramatically
different behavior. In the spin-one model, the stiffness along the chains goes
to zero, implying the onset of Haldane-gap phase, whereas for spin-half the
stiffness along the chains increases monotonically from a value of $0.18 J_x$

magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume-averages for
mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area-averages for the magnetic

computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the
magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the
extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a
dimensionally-split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different
dimensionally-unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in
both C and Fortran95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization

Dyn. 5 (2011), no. 3, 567-602",,,"math.MG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is connected with the problem of describing path metric spaces
that are homeomorphic to manifolds and biLipschitz homogeneous, i.e., whose
biLipschitz homeomorphism group acts transitively.
  Our main result is the following. Let $X = G/H$ be a homogeneous manifold of
a Lie group $G$ and let $d$ be a geodesic distance on $X$ inducing the same
topology. Suppose there exists a subgroup $G_S$ of $G$ that acts transitively
on $X$, such that each element $g \in G_S$ induces a locally biLipschitz
homeomorphism of the metric space $(X,d)$. Then the metric is locally
biLipschitz equivalent to a sub-Riemannian metric. Any such metric is defined
by a bracket generating $G_S$-invariant sub-bundle of the tangent bundle.
  The result is a consequence of a more general fact that requires a transitive
family of uniformly biLipschitz diffeomorphisms with a control on their
differentials. It will be relevant that the group acting transitively on the
space is a Lie group and so it is locally compact, since, in general, the whole
group of biLipschitz maps, unlikely the isometry group, is not locally compact.
  Our method also gives an elementary proof of the following fact. Given a
Lipschitz sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of a Finsler manifold, then both the
class of piecewise differentiable curves tangent to the sub-bundle and the
class of Lipschitz curves almost everywhere tangent to the sub-bundle give rise
to the same Finsler-Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric, under the condition that the
topologies induced by these distances coincide with the manifold topology.

considers subcodes of a primitive BCH code. We prove that this variant is not
secure by finding and solving a linear system satisfied by the entries of the
secret permutation matrix.
  The other variant uses quasi-cyclic low density parity-check codes. This
scheme was devised to be immune against general attacks working for McEliece

McEliece scheme more general one-to-one mappings than permutation matrices. We
suggest here a structural attack exploiting the quasi-cyclic structure of the
code and a certain weakness in the choice of the linear transformations that
hide the generator matrix of the code. Our analysis shows that with high
probability a parity-check matrix of a punctured version of the secret code can
be recovered in cubic time complexity in its length. The complete
reconstruction of the secret parity-check matrix of the quasi-cyclic low

what energy do they carry away from the shock budget? The acceleration process

Force (DETF) models of future data sets, and compare the discriminative power
of experiments designated by the DETF as Stages 2, 3, and 4. Our work reveals a
minimal increase in discriminating power when comparing Stage 3 to Stage 2, but
a very striking increase in discriminating power when going to Stage 4. We also
see evidence that even modest improvements over DETF Stage 4 could result in
even more dramatic discriminating power among quintessence dark energy models.
We develop and demonstrate the technique of using the independently measured
modes of the equation of state as a common parameter space in which to compare
the different quintessence models, and we argue that this technique is a
powerful one. We use the PNGB, Exponential, Albrecht-Skordis, and Inverse
Tracker (or Inverse Power Law) quintessence models for this work. One of our
main results is that the goal of discriminating among these models sets a
concrete measure on the capabilities of future dark energy experiments.

curvature perturbation spectrum are used to derive a set of reconstruction
equations whose solution set can specify up to three of the undetermined

various types of actions assuming power law type scalar and tensor spectra. In
actions that contain only two unknown functions, the third reconstruction
equation implies a consistency relation between the non-gaussianty, sound speed

generalized DBI action with an unknown potential and warp factor. We find that
for realistic scalar and tensor spectra, the reconstructed warp factor and

physical consistency of the reconstructed warp factor and potential imposes
strict constraints on the scalar and tensor spectral indices.

suggest that the source of optical radiation is not unique, perhaps associated
with an inner optically-thick Cold Dense Shell (CDS) and outer optically-thin
shocked material. During the fading phase, our models support a single source
of radiation, an hydrogen-rich optically-thick layer with a near-constant
temperature of ~7000K that recedes from a radius of 4.3x10^15 at peak to
2.3x10^15cm 40 days later. We reproduce the hybrid narrow-core broad-wing line
profile shapes of SN 1994W at all times, invoking an optically-thick
photosphere exclusively (i.e., without any external optically-thick shell). In
SN 1994W, slow expansion makes scattering with thermal electrons a key escape
mechanism for photons trapped in optically-thick line cores, and allows the
resulting broad incoherent electron-scattering wings to be seen around narrow
line cores. In SNe with larger expansion velocities, the thermal broadening due
to incoherent scattering is masked by the broad profile and the dominant
frequency redshift occasioned by bulk motions. Given the absence of broad lines
at all times and the very low 56Ni yields, we speculate whether SN 1994W could
have resulted from an interaction between two ejected shells without core
collapse. The high conversion efficiency of kinetic to thermal energy may not
require a SN-like energy budget for SN1994W.

These non-thermal spectral components differ dramatically from the steeper
quasi-power-law tails seen in the classic X-ray band in these sources, and can
naturally be attributed to activity in the magnetosphere. Resonant, magnetic
Compton upscattering is a candidate mechanism for generating this new
component, since it is very efficient in the strong fields present near AXP

upscattering of surface thermal X-rays in AXPs are presented, using a kinetic
equation formalism and employing a QED magnetic scattering cross section.
Characteristically flat and strongly-polarized emission spectra are produced by
non-thermal electrons injected in the emission region. Spectral results depend
strongly on the observer's orientation and the magnetospheric locale of the
scattering, which couple directly to the angular distributions of photons

clusters pass through the cluster's dense molecular gas and can experience
Bondi-Hoyle accretion from reservoirs outside their individual protostellar
cloud cores. Accretion can occur for several million years after the stars
form, but before the cluster disperses. This accretion is predominantly onto
the disk and not the star. N-body simulations of stars orbiting in three young
model clusters containing 30, 300, and 3000 stars are presented. The
simulations include the gravitational potential of the molecular gas which
smoothly disperses over time. The clusters have a star formation efficiency of
33% and a radius of 0.22 pc. We find that the disks surrounding solar-mass
stars in the N=30 cluster accretes ~0.01 M_sol (~1 minimum-mass solar nebula,
MMSN) per Myr. The accretion rate scales as M^2.1 for stars of mass M. The
accretion rate is ~5 times lower for N=3000 cluster, due to its higher stellar
velocities and higher temperature. The Bondi-Hoyle accretion rates onto the
disks are several times lower than accretion rates observed directly onto young
stars (e.g., Muzerolle et al 2005): these two accretion rates follow the same
M^2 behavior and may be related. The accreted disk mass is large enough that it
may have a substantial and unappreciated effect on disk structure and the
formation of planetary systems. We discuss a variety of implications of this
process, including its effect on metallicity differences between cluster stars,
compositional differences between a star and its disk, the formation of
terrestrial and gas-giant planets, and isotopic anomalies observed in our Solar

filled expanding spheres, expanding shells, filled blister flows, or cometary H

systems with finite rate feedback. The goal is to understand how to efficiently
employ the given finite feedback resource to maximize the sum rate by
characterizing the performance analytically. Towards this, we propose a joint
quantization and feedback strategy: the base station selects the strongest
users, jointly quantizes their strongest eigen-channel vectors and broadcasts a
common feedback to all the users. This joint strategy is different from an
individual strategy, in which quantization and feedback are performed across
users independently, and it improves upon the individual strategy in the same
way that vector quantization improves upon scalar quantization. In our proposed
strategy, the effect of user selection is analyzed by extreme order statistics,
while the effect of joint quantization is quantified by what we term ``the
composite Grassmann manifold''. The achievable sum rate is then estimated by
random matrix theory. Due to its simple implementation and solid performance
analysis, the proposed scheme provides a benchmark for multiaccess MIMO systems
with finite rate feedback.

in regions where the supernova remnant Sgr A East is interacting with the
interstellar medium. The majority of the newly found 1720 MHz OH masers are
located to the northeast, independently indicating and confirming an area of
shock interaction with the +50 km/s molecular cloud (M-0.02-0.07) on the far
side of Sgr A East. The previously known bright masers in the southeast are
suggested to be the result of the interaction between two supernova remnants,
instead of between Sgr A East and the surrounding molecular clouds as generally
found elsewhere in the Galaxy. Together with masers north of the circumnuclear
disk (CND) they outline an interaction on the near side of Sgr A East. In
contrast to the interaction between the +50 km/s cloud and Sgr A East, OH
absorption data do not support a direct interaction between the CND material
and Sgr A East. We also present three new high-negative velocity masers,
supporting a previous single detection. The location and velocities of the
high-negative and high-positive velocity masers are consistent with being near
the tangent points of, and physically located in the CND. We argue that the
high velocity masers in the CND are pumped by dissipation between density
clumps in the CND instead of a shock generated by the supernova remnant. That
is, the CND masers are not coupled to the supernova remnant and are sustained
independently.

become highly inefficient for stiff reaction systems, those in which different
reaction channels operate on widely varying time scales. In this paper, we
develop two methods for accelerating sampling in SSA models: an exact method

Both methods depend on analysis of the eigenvalues of continuous time Markov
model graphs that define the behavior of the SSA. We demonstrate these methods
for the specific application of sampling breakage times for multiply-connected
bond networks, a class of stiff system important to models of self-assembly
processes. We show theoretically and empirically that our eigenvalue methods
provide substantially reduced sampling times for a wide range of network
breakage models. These techniques are also likely to have broad use in
accelerating SSA models so as to apply them to systems and parameter ranges

random spanning trees, and eigenvalues of random matrices, determinantal point
processes (sometimes also called fermionic point processes) are relatively easy
to simulate and provide a quite broad class of models that exhibit repulsion
between points. The fundamental ingredient used to construct a determinantal
point process is a kernel giving the pairwise interactions between points: the
joint distribution of any number of points then has a simple expression in
terms of determinants of certain matrices defined from this kernel. In this
paper we initiate the study of an analogous class of point processes that are
defined in terms of a kernel giving the interaction between $2M$ points for
some integer $M$. The role of matrices is now played by $2M$-dimensional
""hypercubic"" arrays, and the determinant is replaced by a suitable
generalization of it to such arrays -- Cayley's first hyperdeterminant. We show
that some of the desirable features of determinantal point processes continue

which induces spin precession of conduction electron and acts as an effective
magnetic field. Its effect on domain wall motion depends on the wall
configuration. We found that the effect is significant for Bloch wall with the
hard axis along the current, since the effective field works as $\beta$ or
field-like term and removes the threshold current if in extrinsic pinning is
absent. For N\'eel wall and Bloch wall with easy axis perpendicular to Rashba
plane, the effective field induces a step motion of wall corresponding to a
rotation of wall plane by the angle of approximately $\pi$ at current lower
than intrinsic threshold. Rashba interaction would therefore be useful to
assist efficient motion of domain walls at low current.

contrast to the RPA, we report a long-wavelength acoustic phase velocity that
is wholly maintained by particle correlations and varies linearly with the
dipole moment p. The oscillation frequency, calculated both in an extended QLC
approximation and in the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjolander approximation, is invariant
in form over the entire classical to quantum domains all the way down to zero
temperature. Based on our classical MD-generated pair distribution function
data and on ground-state energy data generated by recent quantum Monte Carlo
simulations on a bosonic dipole system [Astrakharchik et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.

speeds and the standard thermodynamic sound speeds in both the classical and
quantum domains.

with two components: a high-temperature (1.5 keV) region with a low ionization
time scale and enhanced abundances, plus a cooler (0.36 keV) component in
ionization equilibrium and with solar abundances. The X-ray spectrum and the
presence of non-thermal, polarized, radio emission together demonstrate that
G350.1-0.3 is a young, luminous supernova remnant (SNR), for which archival HI
and 12-CO data indicate a distance of 4.5 kpc. The diameter of the source then
implies an age of only ~900 years. The SNR's distorted appearance, small size
and the presence of 12-CO emission along the SNR's eastern edge all indicate
that the source is interacting with a complicated distribution of dense ambient
material. An unresolved X-ray source, XMMU J172054.5-372652, is detected a few
arcminutes west of the brightest SNR emission. The thermal X-ray spectrum and
lack of any multi-wavelength counterpart suggest that this source is a neutron

seen coincident with other young SNRs such as Cassiopeia A.

the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of the contrast in redshifted
21cm emission between a large HII region and the surrounding neutral
inter-galactic medium (IGM) will be the simplest and most easily interpreted
signature. However the highest redshift quasars known are thought to reside in
an ionized IGM. Using a semi-analytic model we describe the redshifted 21cm
signal from the IGM surrounding quasars discovered using the i-drop out
technique (i.e. quasars at z~6). We argue that while quasars at z<6.5 seem to
reside in the post overlap IGM, they will still provide valuable probes of the
late stages of the overlap era because the light-travel time across a quasar
proximity zone should be comparable to the duration of overlap. For redshifted
21cm observations within a 32MHz bandpass, we find that the subtraction of a
spectrally smooth foreground will not remove spectral features due to the
proximity zone. These features could be used to measure the neutral hydrogen
content of the IGM during the late stages of reionization. The density of
quasars at z~6 is now well constrained. We use the measured quasar luminosity
function to estimate the prospects for discovery of high redshift quasars in
fields that will be observed by the Murchison Widefield Array.

pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants, the kaon bag parameter $B_K$ and
vector meson couplings. We have used SU(2) chiral perturbation theory, which
assumes only the up and down quark masses are small, and SU(3) chiral
perturbation theory to extrapolate to the physical values for the light quark
masses. While next-to-leading order formulae from both approaches fit our data
for light quarks, we find the higher order corrections for SU(3) very large,
making such fits unreliable. We also find that SU(3) does not fit our data when
the quark masses are near the physical strange quark mass. Thus, we rely on
SU(2) chiral perturbation theory for accurate results. We use the masses of the
$\Omega$ baryon, and the $\pi$ and $K$ mesons to set the lattice scale and
determine the quark masses. We then find $f_\pi = 124.1(3.6)_{\rm

intuitive way, accessible to non-specialists in the field. In the first part,
we focus on the theory of L\'{e}vy processes. We analyze a `toy' example of a
L\'{e}vy process, viz. a L\'{e}vy jump-diffusion, which yet offers significant
insight into the distributional and path structure of a L\'{e}vy process. Then,
we present several important results about L\'{e}vy processes, such as infinite
divisibility and the L\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula, the L\'{e}vy-It\^{o}
decomposition, the It\^{o} formula for L\'{e}vy processes and Girsanov's
transformation. Some (sketches of) proofs are presented, still the majority of
proofs is omitted and the reader is referred to textbooks instead. In the
second part, we turn our attention to the applications of L\'{e}vy processes in
financial modeling and option pricing. We discuss how the price process of an
asset can be modeled using L\'{e}vy processes and give a brief account of
market incompleteness. Popular models in the literature are presented and
revisited from the point of view of L\'{e}vy processes, and we also discuss
three methods for pricing financial derivatives. Finally, some indicative
evidence from applications to market data is presented.

analysis shows that in the Y-terminal system with a two level ideal splitter,
charge fluctuations at a level with a lowest outgoing tunneling rate are
responsible for a super-Poissonian shot noise and positive cross-correlations.
Interestingly, for larger source-drain voltages, electrons are transferred as
independent particles, when three levels participate in transport, and double
occupancy is allowed. We can explain compensation of the current correlations
as the interplay between different bunching and antibunching processes by
performing a spectral decomposition of the correlation functions for partial

leads to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and an enhancement of shot noise.

lens, forming a large arc around itself. The aim of this paper is to study the

environments of other BL Lac objects have been before.We measured the redshifts
of galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra. The
velocity dispersion was then obtained from the redshifts. The gravitational
lensing was used for measuring the mass at the center of the cluster. The mass
of the whole cluster could then be estimated using the softened isothermal
sphere mass distribution. Finally, the richness of the cluster was determined
by counting the number of galaxies near the BL Lac object and obtaining the
galaxy-BL Lac spatial covariance function, $B_{gb}$. The redshifts of nine
galaxies in the field were measured to be near the redshift of the BL Lac
object, confirming the presence of a cluster. The average redshift of the
cluster is 0.268, and the velocity dispersion $(470^{+190}_{-110})$ km
s$^{-1}$. The mass of the cluster is $M_{500}=(4^{+3}_{-2})\times10^{14}

suggests that this is a rich cluster: the result for covariance function is
$B_{gb}=(600\pm200)$ Mpc$^{1.77}$, which corresponds to Abell richness class 1

algorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the
graph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is
undirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has
been extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this
work, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal
decision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly
simple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective,

sufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the
channel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the
consensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay

subluminous stars which are generally believed to be extreme Horizontal Branch
stars or closely related objects. Amongst the field stars a large fraction of
sdBs are found to reside in close binaries. The companions are predominantly
white dwarfs, or low mass main sequence stars. Systems with sufficiently
massive WD companions may qualify as SN Ia progenitors. Recently evidence has
been found that the masses of some unseen companions might exceed the
Chandrasekhar mass, hence they must be neutron stars or black holes. Even a
planet has recently been detected orbiting the pulsating sdB star V391 Peg.
Quite to the opposite, in globular clusters, only very few sdB binaries are
found indicating that the dominant sdB formation processes is different in a
dense environment. Binary population synthesis models identify three formation
channels, (i) stable Roche lobe overflow, (ii) one or two common envelope
ejection phases and (iii) the merger of two helium white dwarfs. The latter
channel may explain the properties of the He-enriched sdO stars because their
binary fraction is lower than that of the sdBs by a factor of ten or more.
Pulsating subluminous B (sdB) stars play an important role for asteroseismology
as this technique has already led to mass determinations for a handful of
stars. A unique hyper-velocity sdO star moving so fast that it is unbound to
the Galaxy has probably been ejected by the super-massive black hole in the
Galactic centre. (abridged)

us to simplify the weak-degradability classification. Moreover, we investigate
the structure of some singular multi-mode channels, like the additive classical
noise channel that can be used to decompose a noisy channel in terms of a less
noisy one in order to find new sets of maps with zero quantum capacity.
Finally, the two-mode case is analyzed in detail. By exploiting the composition

association by applying an age-independent method of counting the PMS stars
within evolutionary tracks, while for the bright MS stars we transform their

briefly some of the main results with the main focus on air showers. Radio
emission of ultra-high energy cosmic particles offers a number of interesting
advantages. Since radio waves suffer no attenuation, radio measurements allow
the detection of very distant or highly inclined showers, can be used day and
night, and provide a bolometric measure of the leptonic shower component. The
LOPES experiment has detected the radio emission from cosmic rays, confirmed
the geosynchrotron effect for extensive air showers, and provided a good
calibration fomula to convert the radio signal into primary particle energy.
Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that also the shower maximum and the
particle composition can be measured. Future steps will be the installation of
radio antennas at the Auger experiment to measure the composition of ultra-high
energy cosmic rays and the usage of the LOFAR radio telescope (and later the
SKA) as a cosmic ray detector. Here an intriguing additional application is the
search for low-frequency radio emission from neutrinos and cosmic rays
interacting with the lunar regolith. This promises the best detection limits

group and the density matrix renormalization group, namely, matrix product
states, to implement an efficient numerical treatment of a two-lead,
multi-level Anderson impurity model. By adopting a star-like geometry, where
each species (spin and lead) of conduction electrons is described by its own
Wilson chain, instead of using a single Wilson chain for all species together,
we achieve a very significant reduction in the numerical resources required to
obtain reliable results. We illustrate the power of this approach by
calculating ground state properties of a four-level quantum dot coupled to two
leads. The success of this proof-of-principle calculation suggests that the
star geometry constitutes a promising strategy for future calculations the
ground state properties of multi-band, multi-level quantum impurity models.
Moreover, we show that it is possible to find an ""optimal"" chain basis,
obtained via a unitary transformation (acting only on the index distinguishing
different Wilson chains), in which degrees of freedom on different Wilson
chains become effectively decoupled from each other further out on the Wilson
chains. This basis turns out to also diagonalize the model's chain-to-chain
scattering matrix. We demonstrate this for a spinless two-lead model,
presenting DMRG-results for the mutual information between two sites located
far apart on different Wilson chains, and NRG results with respect to the

learning community for its very good practical results. The goal of the present
paper is to study this algorithm from a statistical perspective, using tools of
concentration theory and empirical processes. Our main result builds on the
observation made by other authors that the SVM can be viewed as a statistical
regularization procedure. From this point of view, it can also be interpreted
as a model selection principle using a penalized criterion. It is then possible
to adapt general methods related to model selection in this framework to study
two important points: (1) what is the minimum penalty and how does it compare
to the penalty actually used in the SVM algorithm; (2) is it possible to obtain
``oracle inequalities'' in that setting, for the specific loss function used in
the SVM algorithm? We show that the answer to the latter question is positive
and provides relevant insight to the former. Our result shows that it is
possible to obtain fast rates of convergence for SVMs.

relic abundance of dark matter (DM) produced in the early universe. So far
WIMPs have eluded direct detection through interactions with baryonic matter.
Neutrino emission from accumulated WIMP annihilations in the solar core has
been proposed as a signature of DM, but has not yet been detected. These null
results may be due to small scale DM density fluctuations in the halo with the
density of our local region being lower than the average (around 0.3 GeV/cm^3
). However, the accumulated neutrino signal from WIMP annihilations in the
Galactic stellar disk would be insensitive to local density variations. Inside
the disk, dark matter can be captured by stars causing an enhanced annihilation
rate and therefore a potentially higher neutrino flux than what would be
observed from elsewhere in the halo. We estimate a neutrino flux from the WIMP
annihilations in the stellar disk to be enhanced by more than an order of
magnitude compared to the neutrino fluxes from the halo. We offer a
conservative estimate for this enhanced flux, based on the WIMP-nucleon
cross-sections obtained from direct-detection experiments by assuming a density
of around 0.3 GeV/cm^3 for the local DM. We also compare the detectability of
these fluxes with a signal of diffuse high energy neutrinos produced in the
Milky Way by the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium
(ISM). These comparative signals should be observable by large neutrino
detectors.

linearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called
Delassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm.
Dynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus
operator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the

feedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested.
Stable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task

that uses only limited, local, information about the realization of the graph.
In some random graph models it is possible to define such algorithms which
produce short paths when routing from any vertex to any other, while for others
it is not.
  We consider random graphs with random costs assigned to the edges. In this
situation, we use the methods of stochastic dynamic programming to create a
decentralized search method which attempts to minimize the total cost, rather
than the number of steps, of each path. We show that it succeeds in doing so
among all decentralized search algorithms which monotonically approach the
destination. Our algorithm depends on knowing the expected cost of routing from
every vertex to any other, but we show that this may be calculated iteratively,
and in practice can be easily estimated from the cost of previous routes and
compressed into a small routing table. The methods applied here can also be
applied directly in other situations, such as efficient searching in graphs
with varying vertex degrees.

of research has been done to solve these problems heuristically. However, most
of the previous approaches are problem-specific and research into the
development of a general scheduling algorithm is still in its infancy.
  Mimicking the natural evolutionary process of the survival of the fittest,
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have attracted much attention in solving difficult
scheduling problems in recent years. Some obstacles exist when using GAs: there
is no canonical mechanism to deal with constraints, which are commonly met in
most real-world scheduling problems, and small changes to a solution are
difficult. To overcome both difficulties, indirect approaches have been
presented (in [1] and [2]) for nurse scheduling and driver scheduling, where
GAs are used by mapping the solution space, and separate decoding routines then
build solutions to the original problem.

$\epsilon$-efficient solutions (denote by $E_\epsilon$) of a multi-objective
optimization problem with stochastic search algorithms has been proposed. It
was proven that such an algorithm produces -- under mild assumptions on the
process to generate new candidate solutions --a sequence of archives which
converges to $E_{\epsilon}$ in the limit and in the probabilistic sense. The
result, though satisfactory for most discrete MOPs, is at least from the
practical viewpoint not sufficient for continuous models: in this case, the set
of approximate solutions typically forms an $n$-dimensional object, where $n$
denotes the dimension of the parameter space, and thus, it may come to
perfomance problems since in practise one has to cope with a finite archive.
Here we focus on obtaining finite and tight approximations of $E_\epsilon$, the
latter measured by the Hausdorff distance. We propose and investigate a novel
archiving strategy theoretically and empirically. For this, we analyze the
convergence behavior of the algorithm, yielding bounds on the obtained
approximation quality as well as on the cardinality of the resulting
approximation, and present some numerical results.

in the quantum regime by the Euclidean path integral method in semiclassical
approximation. The imaginary time formalism allows one to monitor the system as
a function of temperature. The family of classical paths, saddle points for the
action, is derived in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions whose periodicity
sets the energy-temperature correspondence. The period of the classical
oscillations varies monotonically with the energy up to the sphaleron, pointing
to a smooth crossover from the quantum to the activated regime. The softening
of the quantum fluctuation spectrum is evaluated analytically by the theory of
the functional determinants and computed at low $T$ up to the crossover. In
particular, the negative eigenvalue, causing an imaginary contribution to the
partition function, is studied in detail by solving the Lam\`{e} equation which
governs the fluctuation spectrum. For a heavvy particle mass, the decay rate
shows a remarkable temperature dependence mainly ascribable to a low lying soft
mode and, approaching the crossover, it increases by a factor five over the
predictions of the zero temperature theory. Just beyond the peak value, the
classical Arrhenius behavior takes over. A similar trend is found studying the
quartic metastable potential but the lifetime of the latter is longer by a
factor ten than in a cubic potential with same parameters. Some formal
analogies with noise-induced transitions in classically activated metastable
systems are discussed.
