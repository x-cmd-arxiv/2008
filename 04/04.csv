formed within a pair of cosmological LCDM N-body simulations, and track the
accretion histories of cluster subhalos with masses large enough to host 0.1L*
galaxies. By associating subhalos with cluster galaxies, we find the majority
of galaxies in clusters experience no pre-processing in the group environment
prior to their accretion into the cluster. On average, ~70% of cluster galaxies
fall into the cluster potential directly from the field, with no luminous
companions in their host halos at the time of accretion; and less than ~12% are
accreted as members of groups with five or more galaxies. Moreover, we find
that cluster galaxies are significantly less likely to have experienced a
merger in the recent past (~6 Gyr) than a field halo of the same mass. These
results suggest that local, cluster processes like ram-pressure stripping,
galaxy harassment, or strangulation play the dominant role in explaining the
difference between cluster and field populations at a fixed stellar mass; and
that pre-evolution or past merging in the group environment is of secondary
importance for setting cluster galaxy properties for most clusters. The
accretion times for z = 0 cluster members are quite extended, with ~20%
incorporated into the cluster halo more than 7 Gyr ago and ~20% within the last
2 Gyr. By comparing the observed morphological fractions in cluster and field
populations, we estimate an approximate timescale for late-type to early-type
transformation within the cluster environment to be ~6 Gyr.

that conserve spin is of the order of $v_F^4$ for density fluctuations and
$v_F^2$ for spin fluctuations, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity of neutrons.
The larger suppression of density fluctuations arises because the dipole moment
of the density distribution of a single component system does not vary in time.
For this reason, we find that the axial current response (spin fluctuations)
dominates. In more realistic models of neutron matter which include tensor
interactions where the neutron spin is not conserved, neutrino radiation from
bremsstrahlung reactions occurs at order $v_F^0$. Consequently, even with the
suppression factors due to superfluidity, this rate dominates near $T_C$.
Present calculations of the pair-breaking emissivity are incomplete because
they neglect the tensor component of the nucleon-nucleon interaction.

producing a black hole (BH) surrounded by a torus. Our results represent the
state of the art from several points of view: (i) We use HRSC methods for the
hydrodynamics equations and high-order finite-differencing techniques for the
Einstein equations; (ii) We employ AMR techniques with ""moving boxes""; (iii) We
use as initial data BNSs in irrotational quasi-circular orbits; (iv) We exploit
the isolated-horizon formalism to measure the properties of the BHs produced in
the merger; (v) Finally, we use two approaches, based either on gauge-invariant
perturbations or on Weyl scalars, to calculate the GWs. These techniques allow
us to perform accurate evolutions on timescales never reported before (ie ~30
ms) and to provide the first complete description of the inspiral and merger of
a BNS leading to the prompt or delayed formation of a BH and to its ringdown.
We consider either a polytropic or an ideal fluid EOS and show that already
with this idealized EOSs a very interesting phenomenology emerges. In
particular, we show that while high-mass binaries lead to the prompt formation
of a rapidly rotating BH surrounded by a dense torus, lower-mass binaries give
rise to a differentially rotating NS, which undergoes large oscillations and
emits large amounts of GWs. Eventually, also the NS collapses to a rotating BH
surrounded by a torus. Finally, we also show that the use of a non-isentropic
EOS leads to significantly different evolutions, giving rise to a delayed
collapse also with high-mass binaries, as well as to a more intense emission of
GWs and to a geometrically thicker torus.

not only imply that multiple bipolar ejections have occurred in this nebula,

ejection: a bipolar stellar wind most likely produced the H2 lobes, while
highly collimated outflows are carving out the ionized lobes into the thick
circumstellar envelope. The asymmetry between the southeast and northwest H2

channel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain
quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation
structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler

long-lived and the expected decay mechanism to underlying spin excitations is

that part of the wave-function remains in a bound state. Our study also

was shown that the effective cosmological constant on each of the two orbifold
branes can be easily lowered to its current observational value, by using the
large extra dimensions in the framework of both M-Theory and string theory on
$S^{1}/Z_{2}$. In this paper, we study the current acceleration of the
universe, using the formulas developed in \cite{WS07}. We first construct
explicitly time-dependent solution to the 10-dimensional bulk of the
Neveu-Schwarz/Neveu-Schwarz sector, compactified on a 5-dimensional torus.
Then, we write down the generalized Friedmann equations on each of the two
dynamical branes, and fit the models to the 182 gold supernova Ia data and the
BAO parameter from SDSS, using both of our MINUIT and Monte-Carlo Markov Chain
(MCMC) codes. With the best fitting values of the parameters involved as
initial conditions, we integrate the generalized Friedmann equations
numerically and find the future evolution of the universe. We find that it
depends on the choice of the radion potentials $V_{4}^{(I)} (I = 1, 2)$ of the
branes. In particular, when choosing them to be the Goldberger-Wise potentials,
$V_{4}^{(I)} = \lambda_{4}^{(I)} (\psi^{2} - {v_{I}}^{2})^{2}$, we find that
the current acceleration of the universe driven by the effective cosmological
constant is only temporary. Due to the effects of the potentials, the universe
will be finally in its decelerating expansion phase again. We also study the
proper distance between the two branes, and find that it remains almost
constant during the whole future evolution of the universe in all the models
considered.

\emph{Algebraic Eraser} scheme for key agreement over an insecure channel,

introduced the \emph{Colored Burau Key Agreement Protocol (CBKAP)}, a concrete

  We present general, efficient heuristic algorithms, which extract the shared
key out of the public information provided by CBKAP. These algorithms are,
according to heuristic reasoning and according to massive experiments,
successful for all sizes of the security parameters, assuming that the keys are
chosen with standard distributions.
  Our methods come from probabilistic group theory (permutation group actions
and expander graphs). In particular, we provide a simple algorithm for finding
short expressions of permutations in $S_n$, as products of given random
permutations. Heuristically, our algorithm gives expressions of length
$O(n^2\log n)$, in time and space $O(n^3)$. Moreover, this is provable from
\emph{the Minimal Cycle Conjecture}, a simply stated hypothesis concerning the
uniform distribution on $S_n$. Experiments show that the constants in these
estimations are small. This is the first practical algorithm for this problem
for $n\ge 256$.

CBKAP actually implemented by SecureRF uses proprietary distributions, and thus

to a subset of lambda-terms of System F. WALT is poly-time sound: if a
lambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in
the dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. The evaluation proceeds
under any strategy of a rewriting relation which is a mix of both call-by-name
and call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT weakens, namely generalizes, the notion
of ""stratification of deductions"", common to some Light Systems -- those
logical systems, derived from Linear logic, to characterize the set of
Polynomial functions -- . A weaker stratification allows to define a
compositional embedding of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. It turns
out that the expressivity of WALT is strictly stronger than the one of the
known Light Systems. The embedding passes through the representation of a
subsystem of SRN. It is obtained by restricting the composition scheme of SRN
to one that can only use its safe variables linearly. On one side, this
suggests that SRN, in fact, can be redefined in terms of more primitive
constructs. On the other, the embedding of SRN into WALT enjoys the two
following remarkable aspects. Every datatype, required by the embedding, is
represented from scratch, showing the strong structural proof-theoretical roots
of WALT. Moreover, the embedding highlights a stratification structure of the
normal and safe arguments, normally hidden inside the world of SRN-normal/safe
variables: the less an argument is ""polyomially impredicative"", the deeper, in
a formal, proof-theoretical sense, it is represented inside WALT. Finally,
since WALT is SRN-complete it is also polynomial-time complete since SRN is.

phase, the MIT bag model of the deconfined 3-flavor strange quark matter is
used. As a result, our equation of state is thermodynamically stable and
exhibits qualitatively the desired properties of hadron-quark mixed matter,
such as the temperature dependence of the transition density. The pions raise
the transition density because they make the equation of state softer. Using
the equation of state constructed here, we study its astrophysical
implications. The maximum mass of compact stars is investigated, and our
equation of state is consistent with recent observations. We also compute the
collapse of a massive star with 100 solar masses using our equation of state

becomes shorter for the model with pions and quarks. The pions and quarks
affect the total energy of the emitted neutrinos because the duration time of
the neutrino emission becomes shorter. The neutrino luminosity rises under the
effect of pions since the density of the proto-neutron star becomes high.

models, symmetry-dependent stress tensor defines force, and continuous group
parameters of the local Landau potential are linked with the laws of
conservation and equations of continuity. Equations of continuity for momentum
in the present model are in agreement with the second Newton's law and result
from the equations of state, by analogy with equations of continuity for
current, obtained from Maxwell equations in electrodynamics. It is shown that
the principle of local homogeneity corresponds to the model of continuum with
fibering of space into locally homogeneous subspaces in each of its points,
resulting in the gauge model with minimal interaction in the Landau theory.
Phenomenological charge responsible for minimal interaction of an order
parameter (OP) and its compensating field linearly enters the expression for
momentum, that being in agreement with the principle of equivalence of masses.
Local Landau theory is consistent with ideas of quantum mechanics, because
condensate, in a small volume, has wave properties and describes the wave

layers were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The depth profile of density in
the sample has been obtained from specular neutron reflectivity data. AFM image
of the air-film interface shows that the surface is covered by globular islands
of different sizes. The AFM height distribution of the surface clearly shows
two peaks [Fig. 3] and the relief structure (islands) on the surface in the
film can be treated as a quasi-two-level random rough surface structure. We
have demonstrated that the detailed morphology of air-film interfaces, the
quasi-two level surface structure as well as morphology of the buried
interfaces can be obtained from off-specular neutron reflectivity data. We have
shown from AFM and off-specular neutron reflectivity data that the morphologies
of electro-deposited surface is distinctly different from that of
sputter-deposited interface in this sample. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first attempt to microscopically quantify the differences in
morphologies of metallic interfaces deposited by two different techniques viz.
electro-deposition and sputtering.

images of gravitationally lensed sources. In some notable cases, typical
lensing analyses assuming isothermal galaxy density profiles produce low values
for the Hubble constant, inconsistent with the result of the HST Key Project
(72 +- 8 km/s/Mpc). Possible systematics in the values of the Hubble constant
derived from galaxy lensing systems can result from a number of factors, e.g.
neglect of environmental effects, assumption of isothermality, or contamination
by line-of-sight structures. One additional potentially important factor is the
triaxial structure of the lensing galaxy halo; most lens models account for
halo shape simply by perturbing the projected spherical lensing potential, an
approximation that is often necessary but that is inadequate at the levels of
triaxiality predicted in the CDM paradigm. To quantify the potential error
introduced by this assumption in estimates of the Hubble parameter, we strongly
lens a distant galaxy through a sample of triaxial softened isothermal halos
and use an MCMC method to constrain the lensing halo profile and the Hubble
parameter from the resulting multiple image systems. We explore the major
degeneracies between the Hubble parameter and several parameters of the lensing

high-dimensional, linear regression models when the number of covariates may
increase to infinity with the sample size. We are particularly interested in
the use of bridge estimators to distinguish between covariates whose
coefficients are zero and covariates whose coefficients are nonzero. We show
that under appropriate conditions, bridge estimators correctly select
covariates with nonzero coefficients with probability converging to one and
that the estimators of nonzero coefficients have the same asymptotic
distribution that they would have if the zero coefficients were known in
advance. Thus, bridge estimators have an oracle property in the sense of Fan
and Li [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 96 (2001) 1348--1360] and Fan and Peng [Ann.
Statist. 32 (2004) 928--961]. In general, the oracle property holds only if the
number of covariates is smaller than the sample size. However, under a partial
orthogonality condition in which the covariates of the zero coefficients are
uncorrelated or weakly correlated with the covariates of nonzero coefficients,
we show that marginal bridge estimators can correctly distinguish between

one even when the number of covariates is greater than the sample size.

most varied and powerful sources known in the universe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
are natural candidates. Here, we argue that cosmic rays can be accelerated by
large amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMWs) when the MHD approximation of
the field in the wind generated by the GRB's magnetized central engine breaks
down. The central engine considered here is a strange star born with
differential rotation from the accretion induced conversion of a neutron star
into a strange star in a low-mass X-ray binary system. The LAEMWs generated
this way accelerate light ions to the highest energies $E =
q\eta\Delta\Phi_{max}$ with an efficiency $\eta \sim 10^{-1}$ that accounts for
all plausible energy losses. Alternatively, we also consider the possibility
that, once formed, the LAEMWs are unstable to creation of a relativistically
strong electromagnetic turbulence due to an overturn instability. Under this
assumption, a lower limit to the efficiency of acceleration is estimated to be
about $\eta \sim 10^{-2.5}$. Due to their age, low mass X-ray binary systems
can be located in regions of low interstellar medium density as, e.g., globular
clusters or even intergalactic medium in case of high proper motion systems,
and cosmic ray energy losses due to proton collisions with photons at the
decelerating region are avoided, thus opening the possibility for particles to
exploit the full voltage available, well beyond that currently observed.

the first time the numerical estimates of the elastic parameters for
polycrystalline LaOFeAs ceramics are performed. Our analysis shows that LaOFeAs
belong to the anisotropic mechanically stable systems; a parameter limiting the
mechanical stability of this material is the shear modulus. In addition,
LaOFeAs is a soft material (B -98 GPa) with high compressibility (betta -
0.0102 1/GPa); lays at the border of a brittle behavior and adopts a high ionic
contribution in intra-atomic bonding.

that the transformation that is inverted is known. Although, in many
applications, it is unrealistic to make this assumption, the problem is often
insoluble without it. However, if additional data are available, then it is
possible to estimate consistently the unknown error density. Data are seldom
available directly on the transformation, but repeated, or replicated,
measurements increasingly are becoming available. Such data consist of
``intrinsic'' values that are measured several times, with errors that are
generally independent. Working in this setting we treat the nonparametric
deconvolution problems of density estimation with observation errors, and
regression with errors in variables. We show that, even if the number of
repeated measurements is quite small, it is possible for modified kernel
estimators to achieve the same level of performance they would if the error
distribution were known. Indeed, density and regression estimators can be
constructed from replicated data so that they have the same first-order
properties as conventional estimators in the known-error case, without any
replication, but with sample size equal to the sum of the numbers of
replicates. Practical methods for constructing estimators with these properties
are suggested, involving empirical rules for smoothing-parameter choice.

can be used to describe the slow decay of the sample autocorrelations of the
squared returns often observed in financial time series, which warrants the
further study of parameter estimation methods for the model. Since the
parameters are changing over time, a successful estimator needs to perform well
for small samples. We propose a kernel normalized-least-squares (kernel-NLS)
estimator which has a closed form, and thus outperforms the previously proposed
kernel quasi-maximum likelihood (kernel-QML) estimator for small samples. The
kernel-NLS estimator is simple, works under mild moment assumptions and avoids
some of the parameter space restrictions imposed by the kernel-QML estimator.
Theoretical evidence shows that the kernel-NLS estimator has the same rate of
convergence as the kernel-QML estimator. Due to the kernel-NLS estimator's ease
of computation, computationally intensive procedures can be used. A
prediction-based cross-validation method is proposed for selecting the
bandwidth of the kernel-NLS estimator. Also, we use a residual-based bootstrap
scheme to bootstrap the tvARCH process. The bootstrap sample is used to obtain
pointwise confidence intervals for the kernel-NLS estimator. It is shown that
distributions of the estimator using the bootstrap and the ``true'' tvARCH
estimator asymptotically coincide. We illustrate our estimation method on a
variety of currency exchange and stock index data for which we obtain both good
fits to the data and accurate forecasts.

that in a system of hydrodynamically interacting particles, the pressure
dipoles contribute to the macroscopic suspension flow in a similar way as the

appear compared to the bosonic case. The propagator contains both \gamma and
non-\gamma terms, and there is a relative phase of \pi/2 between the two in the
time-like regime for arbitrary scaling dimension. This should result in
additional interference effects on top of the one known in the bosonic case.

suppressed by a light fermion mass but are enhanced by a large bosonic mass in

steeper with spatial frequency compared to ordinary natural images. When
external face features (like hair) are suppressed, then whitening of the
corresponding mean amplitude spectra revealed higher response amplitudes at
those spatial frequencies which are deemed important for processing face
identity. The results presented here therefore provide support for that face

faint slope of the XLF flattens at high z, but we do find significant (factor
~3.6) negative evolution of the space density of low luminosity AGN. Combining
with bright end data from very wide surveys we also see marginal evidence for
continued positive evolution of the characteristic break luminosity L*. Our
data therefore support models of luminosity-dependent density evolution between
z=1 and z=3. A sharp upturn in the the XLF is seen at the very lowest
luminosities (Lx < 10^42.5 erg s^-1), most likely due to the contribution of
pure X-ray starburst galaxies at very faint fluxes.

the vesicles has been recorded thanks to digital holographic microscopy, during
parabolic flights and under normal gravity conditions. The collected data
demonstrates that vesicles are pushed away from the walls with a lift velocity
proportional to $\dot{\gamma} R^3/z^2$ where $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shear rate,
$R$ the vesicle radius and $z$ its distance from the wall. This scaling as well
as the dependence of the lift velocity upon vesicle aspect ratio are consistent

(h-BN) following nanosecond laser irradiation of the surface under vacuum and
in different environments of nitrogen gas and ambient air. The observed
fluorescence bands are tentatively ascribed to impurity and mono (VN), or
multiple (m-VN with m = 2 or 3) nitrogen vacancies. A structured fluorescence
band between 300 nm and 350 nm is assigned to impurity-band transition and its
complex lineshape is attributed to phonon replicas. An additional band at 340
nm, assigned to VN vacancies on surface, is observed under vacuum and quenched
by adsorbed molecular oxygen. UV-irradiation of h-BN under vacuum results in a
broad asymmetric fluorescence at ~400 nm assigned to m-VN vacancies; further
irradiation breaks more B-N bonds enriching the surface with elemental boron.
However, no boron deposit appears under irradiation of samples in ambient
atmosphere. This effect is explained by oxygen healing of radiation-induced
surface defects. Formation of the oxide layer prevents B-N dissociation and
preserves the bulk sample stoichiometry.

tightness of spiral structure) and the mass of supermassive black holes (BHs)

through a combination of other relationships, whose existence has already been
demonstrated. The recent discovery of AGN in bulgeless disk galaxies suggests
that halo concentration or virial mass may be one of the determining factors in
BH mass. Taken together with the result that mass concentration seems to
determine spiral arm pitch angle, one would expect a relation to exist between
spiral arm pitch angle and supermassive BH mass in disk galaxies, and we find
that this is indeed the case. We conclude that this relationship may be
important for estimating evolution in BH masses in disk galaxies out to
intermediate redshifts, since regular spiral arm structure can be seen in
galaxies out to z~1.
