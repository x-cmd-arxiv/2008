some intriguing biotechnological implications. The attractive interaction
contribution between two oppositely particles arises from the correlated

aggregation kinetics of polyion-induced colloidal complexes through Monte Carlo
simulation, in which the effect of charge anisotropy is taken into account by a
DLVO-like intra-particle potential, as recentely proposed by Velegol and Thwar
[D. Velegol and P.K. Thwar, Langmuir, 17, 2001]. The results reveal that in the

the progressive increase of the potential barrier height upon clustering.
Within this framework, the experimentally observed cluster phases in
polyelectrolyte-liposomes solutions should be considered as a kinetic arrested
state.

of fermions interacting via a short-range s-wave attraction, featuring unequal
chemical potentials for the two fermionic species (asymmetric systems). As a
consequence of the attractive interaction, fermions form a condensate that
spontaneously breaks the U(1) symmetry associated with total number
conservation. Therefore at sufficiently small temperatures and asymmetries, the
system is a superfluid. We reproduce previous results for the stability
conditions of the system as a function of the four-fermion coupling and
asymmetry. We obtain these results analyzing the coefficients of the low energy
effective Lagrangian of the modes describing fluctuations in the magnitude
(Higgs mode) and in the phase (Goldstone mode) of the difermion condensate. We
find that for certain values of parameters, the mass of the Higgs mode
decreases with increasing mismatch between the chemical potentials of the two
populations, if we keep the scattering length and the gap parameter constant.
Furthermore, we find that the energy cost for creating a position dependent
fluctuation of the condensate is constant in the gapped region and increases in
the gapless region. These two features may lead to experimentally detectable
effects. As an example, we argue that if the superfluid is put in rotation, the
square of the radius of the outer core of a vortex should sharply increase on
increasing the asymmetry, when we pass through the relevant region in the
gapless superfluid phase. Finally, by gauging the global U(1) symmetry, we
relate the coefficients of the effective Lagrangian of the Goldstone mode with
the screening masses of the gauge field.

arguments supported by simple numerics, we argue that proximate phases encoded

previously explored in the monopole-free sector of the theory. Surprisingly, we

The RL quasars occupy a much more restricted domain in this optical plane
compared to the RQ sources, which a 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov test finds to be
highly significant. This tells us that the range of BLR kinematics and
structure for RL sources is more restricted than for the RQ QSOs, which
supports the notion of dichotomy. FRII and CD RL sources also show significant
4DE1 domain differences that likely reflect differences in line of sight
orientation (inclined vs. face-on respectively) for these two classes. The
possibility of a distinct Radio Intermediate (RI) population between RQ and RL
source is disfavored because a 4DE1 diagnostic space comparison shows no
difference between RI and RQ sources. We show that searches for dichotomy in
radio vs. bolometric luminosity diagrams will yield ambiguous results mainly
because in a reasonably complete sample the radio brightest RQ sources will be
numerous enough to blur the gap between RQ and RL sources. Within resolution
constraints of NVSS and FIRST we find no FRI sources among the broad line

error-free feedback, the outage-optimal quantizer for power control has a
circular structure. Moreover, the diversity gain of the system increases
polynomially with the cardinality of the power control codebook. Here, a
similar system is studied, but when the feedback link is error-prone. We prove
that in the high-SNR regime, the optimal quantizer structure with noisy
feedback is still circular and the optimal Voronoi regions are contiguous
non-zero probability intervals. Furthermore, the optimal power control codebook
resembles a channel optimized scalar quantizer (COSQ), i.e., the Voronoi
regions merge with erroneous feedback information. Using a COSQ, the outage
performance of the system is superior to that of a no-feedback scheme. However,
asymptotic analysis shows that the diversity gain of the system is the same as
a no-CSIT scheme if there is a non-zero and non-vanishing feedback error
probability.

believed that antiferromagnetism plays a fundamental role in the
superconducting mechanism because superconductivity occurs when mobile
electrons or holes are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. The
recent discovery of superconductivity in the rare-earth (R) iron-based oxide
systems [RO1-xFxFeAs] has generated enormous interest because these materials
are the first noncopper oxide superconductors with Tc exceeding 50 K. The
parent (nonsuperconducting) LaOFeAs material is metallic but shows anomalies
near 150 K in both resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility. While optical
conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a
spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed with doping electrons to
form superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of the SDW order.
Here we use neutron scattering to demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt
structural distortion below ~150 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal
(space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures,
and then followed with the development of long range SDW-type antiferromagnetic
order at ~134 K with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the
system with flourine suppresses both the magnetic order and structural
distortion in favor of superconductivity. Therefore, much like high-Tc copper
oxides, the superconducting regime in these Fe-based materials occurs in close
proximity to a long-range ordered antiferromagnetic ground state. Since the

earlier attempts, the orbit and progenitor properties of NGC 205 are not well
known. We perform an optimized search for these unknowns by combining a genetic
algorithm with restricted N-body simulations of the interaction. This approach,
coupled with photometric and kinematic observations as constraints, allows for
an effective exploration of the parameter space. We represent NGC 205 as a
static Hernquist potential with embedded massless test particles that serve as
tracers of surface brightness. We explore 3 distinct, initially stable
configurations of test particles: cold rotating disk, warm rotating disk, and
hot, pressure-supported spheroid. Each model reproduces some, but not all, of
the observed features of NGC 205, leading us to speculate that a rotating
progenitor with substantial pressure support could match all of the
observables. Furthermore, plausible combinations of mass and scale length for
the pressure-supported spheroid progenitor model reproduce the observed
velocity dispersion profile. For all 3 models, orbits that best match the
observables place the satellite 11+/-9 kpc behind M31 moving at very large
velocities: 300-500 km/s on primarily radial orbits. Given that the observed
radial component is only 54 km/s, this implies a large tangential motion for
NGC 205, moving from the NW to the SE. These results suggest NGC 205 is not
associated with the stellar arc observed to the NE of NGC 205. Furthermore, NGC
205's velocity appears to be near or greater than its escape velocity,
signifying that the satellite is likely on its first M31 passage.

prove to be a useful way to probe BH growth in distant Compton-thin type 2

primarily on optical-UV luminosity rather than on L/L_Edd in a sample of RQ
AGNs spanning five orders of magnitude in luminosity and over two orders of

array or larger depending on the pass loss exponent. As shown by simulations,
spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order of
magnitude or more even if only one extra antenna is added to each node.

wide range of galactocentric radii (R_G). The observations were made with the
Infrared Spectrograph with the short wavelength, high resolution module. The
above set of five lines is observed cospatially, thus permitting a reliable
comparison of the fluxes. From the measured fluxes, we determine the ionic
abundance ratios including Ne++/Ne+, S3+/S++, and S++/Ne+ and find that there
is a correlation of increasingly higher ionization with larger R_G. By sampling
the dominant ionization states of Ne (Ne+, Ne++) and S (S++, S3+) for H II
regions, we can estimate the Ne/H, S/H, and Ne/S ratios. We find from linear
least-squares fits that there is a decrease in metallicity with increasing R_G:
d log (Ne/H)/dR_G = -0.058+-0.014 and d log (S/H)/dR_G = -0.052+-0.021 dex
kpc-1. There is no apparent variation in the Ne/S ratio with R_G. Unlike our
previous similar study of M83, where we conjectured that this ratio was an
upper limit, for M33 the derived ratios are likely a robust indication of Ne/S.
This occurs because the H II regions have lower metallicity and higher
ionization than those in M83. Both Ne and S are primary elements produced in
alpha-chain reactions, following C and O burning in stars, making their yields
depend very little on the stellar metallicity. Thus, it is expected that Ne/S
remains relatively constant throughout a galaxy. The median (average) Ne/S
ratio derived for H II regions in M33 is 16.3 (16.9), just slightly higher than

the six dimensional model has been reduced to a three dimensional model for the

simplified model system with three timescales that retains many properties of
the original equations, and we employ this system to elucidate the underlying
structure and explain a novel mechanism for the generation of mixed-mode
oscillations based on the canard phenomenon. In particular, we prove the
existence of a special solution, a singular primary canard, that serves as a
transition between mixed-mode oscillations and spiking in the singular limit by
employing appropriate rescalings, center manifold reductions, and energy
arguments. Additionally, we conjecture that the singular canard solution is the

as-yet unverified theoretical predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in
strong electromagnetic fields. Exhibiting magnetic field strengths well in
excess of a TeraGauss, such compact astrophysical environments permit the
action of exotic mechanisms that are forbidden by symmetries in field-free
regions. Foremost among these processes are single-photon pair creation, where
a photon converts to an electron-positron pair, and magnetic photon splitting,
where a single photon divides into two of lesser energy via the coupling to the
external field. The pair conversion process is exponentially small in weak
fields, and provides the leading order contribution to vacuum polarization. In
contrast, photon splitting possesses no energy threshold and can operate in
kinematic regimes where the lower order pair conversion is energetically
forbidden. This paper outlines some of the key physical aspects of these
processes, and highlights their manifestation in neutron star magnetospheres.
Anticipated observational signatures include profound absorption turnovers in
pulsar spectra at gamma-ray wavelengths. The shapes of these turnovers provide
diagnostics on the possible action of pair creation and the geometrical locale
of the photon emission region. There is real potential for the first
confirmation of strong field QED with the new GLAST mission, to be launched by
NASA in 2008. Suppression of pair creation by photon splitting and its
implications for pulsars is also discussed.

other with high precision. Recent advances in imaging have allowed for the
monitoring of axonal, dendritic, and synapse dynamics in vivo. It is observed
that the majority of axonal and dendritic branches are formed 'in error', only
to be retracted later. The functional significance of the overproduction of
branches is not clear. In this study, we use a computational model to
investigate the speed and efficiency of different branching strategies. We show
that branching itself allows for substantial acceleration in the identification
of appropriate targets through the use of a parallel search. We also show that
the formation of new branches in the vicinity of existing synapses leads to the
formation of target connectivity with a decreased number of erroneous branches.
This finding allows us to explain the high correlation between the branch
points and synapses observed in the Xenopus laevis retinotectal system. We also
suggest that the most efficient branching rule is different for axons and
dendrites. The optimal axonal strategy is to form new branches in the vicinity
of existing synapses, whereas the optimal rule for dendrites is to form new
branches preferentially in the vicinity of synapses with correlated pre- and
postsynaptic electric activity. Thus, our studies suggest that the developing

members of the enigmatic group of Double Periodic Variables (DPVs) recently
found in the Magellanic Clouds. The modeling of archival orbital light curves
(LCs), along with the analysis of the radial velocities suggest that this
object is a semi--detached binary with the less massive star transferring
matter to the more massive and less evolved star, in an Algol--like
configuration. We find evidence for additional orbital variability and
H$\alpha$ emission, likely caused by an accretion disc around the primary star.
As in the case of $\beta Lyr$ the circumprimary disc seems to be more luminous
than the primary, but we do not detect orbital period changes. We find that the
LC follows a loop in the color--magnitude diagram during the long cycle; the
system is redder when brighter and the rising phase is bluer than during
decline. Infrared excess is also present. The source of the long--term
periodicity is not eclipsed, indicating its circumbinary origin. Strong
asymmetries, discrete absorption components (DACs) and a $\gamma$ shift are new
and essential observational properties in the infrared H I lines. The DACs
strength and RV follow a saw--teeth pattern during the orbital cycle. We
suggest that the system experiences supercycles of mass outflow feeding a
circumbinary disc. Mass exchange and mass loss could produce comparable but
opposite effects in the orbital period on a long time scale, resulting in a
quasi--constancy of this parameter.

not employ an explicit form of the pairing interaction. This allows to obtain a
simple analytic expression for the vertex function only in terms of the order
parameter and other macroscopic parameters of the system. We use this effective
vertex to analyze the linear response function of the superfluid medium at
finite temperatures. At the time-like momentum transfer, the imaginary part of
the response function is found to be proportional to the fourth power of small
Fermi velocity, i.e. the energy losses through vector currents are strongly
suppressed. As an application, we calculate the neutrino energy losses through
neutral weak currents caused by the pair recombination in the superfluid
neutron matter at temperatures lower than the critical one for S-wave pairing.
This approach confirms a strong suppression of the neutrino energy losses as
predicted in Ref.[4].
