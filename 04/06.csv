could be creatable, i. e., could have vanishing energy, linear momentum and
angular momentum, as it could be expectable if the Universe arose as a quantum
fluctuation. On account of previous results, the background is assumed to be
either closed (with very small curvature) or flat. In the first case, fully
arbitrary linear perturbations are considered; whereas in the flat case, it is
assumed the existence of: (i) inflationary scalar perturbations, that is to
say, Gaussian adiabatic scalar perturbations having an spectrum close to the
Harrison-Zel'dovich one, and (ii) arbitrary tensor perturbations. We conclude
that, any closed perturbed universe is creatable, and also that, irrespective
of the spectrum and properties of the inflationary gravitational waves,
perturbed flat FRW universes with standard inflation are not creatable. Some
considerations on pre-inflationary scalar perturbations are also presented. The
creatable character of perturbed FRW universes is studied, for the first time,
in this paper.

5 T, applied along the nanotube axis, brightened the dark state, leading to the
emergence of a new emission peak. The peak rapidly grew in intensity with
increasing field at the expense of the originally-dominant bright exciton peak
and finally became dominant at fields $>$3 T. This behavior, universally
observed for more than 50 nanotubes of different chiralities, can be
quantitatively explained through a model incorporating the Aharonov-Bohm effect
and intervalley Coulomb mixing, unambiguously proving the existence of dark
excitons. The directly measured dark-bright splitting values were 1-4 meV for
tube diameters 1.0-1.3 nm. Scatter in the splitting value emphasizes the role

optimally-doped Bi2212 along the nodal direction has been studied via
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Fine structure is observed in the
real part of the self-energy (Re$\Sigma$), including a subkink and maximum,
suggesting that electrons couple to a spectrum of bosonic modes, instead of
just one mode. Upon cooling through the superconducting phase transition, the
fine structures of the extracted Re$\Sigma$ exhibit a two-processes evolution
demonstrating an interplay between kink renormalization and superconductivity.
We show that this two-process evolution can be qualitatively explained by a
simple Holstein model in which a spectrum of bosonic modes is considered.

natural generalization of the white Wishart ensemble. Mathematically, it can be
defined on three kinds of variables: the real, the complex and the quaternion.
For practical application, we are interested in the limiting distribution of
the largest sample eigenvalue.
  We first give a new proof of the result of Baik, Ben Arous and P\'{e}ch\'{e}
for the complex spiked model, based on the method of multiple orthogonal
polynomials by Bleher and Kuijlaars. Then in the same spirit we present a new
result of the rank 1 quaternionic spiked model, proven by combinatorial
identities involving quaternionic Zonal polynomials (\alpha = 1/2 Jack
polynomials) and skew orthogonal polynomials.
  We find a phase transition phenomenon for the limiting distribution in the
rank 1 quaternionic spiked model as the spiked population eigenvalue increases,
and recognize the seemingly new limiting distribution on the critical point as
the limiting distribution of the largest sample eigenvalue in the real white
Wishart ensemble.
  Finally we give conjectures for higher rank quaternionic spiked model and the
real spiked model.

substantially improve the performance of dynamical decoupling methods [L. F.

focusing on the suppression of internal unwanted interactions in closed quantum
systems, we review and further elaborate on the advantages of randomization at
long evolution times. By way of illustration, special emphasis is devoted to
isolated Heisenberg-coupled chains of spin-1/2 particles. In particular, for
nearest-neighbor interactions, two types of decoupling cycles are contrasted:
inefficient averaging, whereby the number of control actions increases
exponentially with the system size, and efficient averaging associated to a
fixed-size control group. The latter allows for analytical and numerical
studies of efficient decoupling schemes created by exploiting and merging
together randomization and deterministic strategies, such as symmetrization,
concatenation, and cyclic permutations. Notably, sequences capable to remove
interactions up to third order are explicitly constructed. The consequences of
faulty controls are also analyzed.

observed high concentrations of several clusters are quite unlikely in the
standard Lambda CDM cosmological model, but that due to various inherent
uncertainties, the statistical range of the predicted distribution may be
significantly wider than commonly acknowledged. In addition, the probability
distribution function of the Einstein radius of A1689 is evaluated, confirming
that the observed value of ~45"" +/- 5"" is very improbable in the currently
favoured cosmological model. If, however, a variance of ~20% in the
theoretically predicted value of the virial radius is assumed, than the
discrepancy is much weaker. The measurement of similarly large Einstein radii
in several other clusters would pose a difficulty to the standard model. If so,
earlier formation of the large scale structure would be required, in accord
with predictions of some quintessence models. We have indeed verified that in a
viable early dark energy model large Einstein radii are predicted in as many as
a few tens of high-mass clusters.

performed using standard IRAF tools. The indirect imaging technique of Doppler
tomography was applied, in order to map the accretion disc and distinguish
between the different emission sources.
  The spectra are characterised by strong Balmer emission, together with lines
of HeI and the iron triplet FeII 42. All lines are double-peaked, but the
blue-to-red peak strength and central absorption depth vary. The primary's
velocity was found to be 84.9 km/sec. The spectrograms of the emission lines
reveal the prograde rotation of a disc-like emitting region and, for the Balmer
and HeI lines, an enhancement of the red-wing during eclipse indicates a bright
spot origin. The modulation of the double-peak separation shows a highly
asymmetric disc with non-uniform emissivity. This is confirmed by the Doppler
maps, which apart from the disc and bright spot emission also indicate an
additional region of enhanced emission in the 4th quadrant (+Vx, -Vy), which we
associate with the superhump light source. Given the behaviour of the iron
triplet and its distinct differences from the rest of the lines, we attribute
its existence to an extended gas region above the disc. Its origin can be

(S/N>50 in the continuum near Halpha and Hbeta) were obtained in the spectral
range ~4000 to 7500 \AA, with a resolution between 5 and 15 A, using the 6-m
and the 1-m SAO's telescopes (Russia), the GHAO's 2.1-m telescope (Cananea,
Mexico), and the OAN-SPM's 2.1-m telescope (San-Pedro, Mexico). The observed
fluxes of the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma and HeII emission lines and of the
continuum at the observed wavelength 5117 A, were corrected for the position
angle, the seeing and the aperture effects.
  We found that the continuum and line fluxes varied strongly (up to a factor
6) during the monitoring period. The emission was maximum in 1996-1998, and
there were two minima, in 2001 and in 2005. The Halpha, Hgamma and He II fluxes
were well correlated with the Hbeta flux. We considered three characteristic
periods during which the Hbeta and Halpha profiles were similar: 1996-1999,
2000-2001 and 2002-2006. The line to continuum flux ratios were different; in
particular during the first period, the lines were not correlated with the
continuum and saturated at high fluxes. In the second and third period, where
the continuum flux was small, the Halpha and Hbeta fluxes were well correlated
to the continuum flux, meaning that the ionizing continuum was a good
extrapolation of the optical continuum. The CCFs are often asymmetrical and the
time lags between the lines and the continuum are badly defined indicating the
presence of a complex BLR, with dimensions from 1 to 50 light-days.

quark, heavy enough not to be produced at the LHC, namely, the contribution of
the new quark to the branching ratios of the K to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}, B to \pi
\nu \bar{\nu} and B to K \nu \bar{\nu} decays. We show that the deviation from
the Standard Model can be up to 10% in the case of a 5 TeV quark. Precise
measurements of these branching ratios at the future experiments will allow to
observe the contributions of the new quark or to impose stronger constraints on
its mass.

consist of a basis of a free Lie algebra is a direct construction: to start
with a linear space spanned by Hall words, to define the Lie product of Hall
words, and then to check that the product yields the Lie identities (Marshall
Hall, 1950). Here we suggest another way using the Composition-Diamond lemma
for free anti-commutative (non-associative) algebras (A.I. Shirshov, 1962).

result that any Akivis algebra is linear and D. Segal's result that the set of
all good words in $X^{**}$ forms a linear basis of the free Pre-Lie algebra
$PLie(X)$ generated by the set $X$. For completeness, we give the details of
the proof of Shirshov's Composition-Diamond lemma for non-associative algebras.

$\dot{x}=Ax$, $x(0)=x_0\in D(A)$ for linear operators $A$ defined on a locally
convex space $X$. This approach was firstly introduced in the paper
  ""Chernoff and Trotter type product formulas"" to study the problem for Banach
spaces.
  In this paper we not only generalize the results of the previous paper to
more general topological spaces but also get new results for Banach spaces. In
particular, we prove the ""local"" extension of Chernoff-Trotter-Kato type
theorems. Applying this result, we prove Chernoff, Lie-Trotter and Trotter-Kato
theorems for locally convex spaces. Also we find necessary and sufficient
conditions for the validity of the Chernoff and Trotter product formulas.
