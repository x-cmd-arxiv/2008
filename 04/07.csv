validity of their spreadsheets. They are beginning to understand the
spreadsheet error literature, including what it tells them about the need for
comprehensive spreadsheet testing. However, controlling for fraud will require
a completely new set of capabilities, and a great deal of new research will be
needed to develop fraud control capabilities. This paper discusses the
riskiness of spreadsheets, which can now be quantified to a considerable
degree. It then discusses how to use control frameworks to reduce the dangers
created by spreadsheets. It focuses especially on testing, which appears to be
the most crucial element in spreadsheet controls.

Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) down to i' ~ 25.5. We select 65 SN
candidates showing significant spatial offset from nuclei of the host galaxies
having old stellar population at z ~ 0.4-1.2, out of more than 1,000 SXDS
variable objects. Although spectroscopic type classification is not available
for these, we quantitatively demonstrate that more than ~80% of these should be
SNe Ia. The DTD is derived using the stellar age estimates of the old galaxies
based on 9 band photometries from optical to mid-infrared wavelength. Combined
with the observed SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies at the local universe, the
DTD in t_Ia ~ 0.1-10 Gyr is well described by a featureless power-law as
f_D(t_Ia) \propto t_Ia^{-1}. The derived DTD is in excellent agreement with the
generic prediction of the double-degenerate scenario, giving a strong support
to this scenario. In the single-degenerate (SD) scenario, although predictions
by simple analytic formulations have broad DTD shapes that are similar to the
observation, DTD shapes calculated by more detailed binary population synthesis
tend to have strong peaks at characteristic time scales, which do not fit the
observation. This result thus indicates either that the SD channel is not the
major contributor to SNe Ia in old stellar population, or that improvement of
binary population synthesis theory is required. Various sources of systematic
uncertainties are examined and tested, but our main conclusions are not
affected significantly.

of no needing so heavy particles and having a $Z_2$ parity symmetry

be the Zee model. Recently a new type model along this line of thought was

maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos is realized, it can also be shown that
only an inverted mass spectrum, the value of $|V_{MNS_{13}}|$ is 0.0034 and so
on. For the fermionic CDM candidates, we find that the mass of the CDM and the

domain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x
[0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per
element. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The
boundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch
can be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially
ordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they
share implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded.
The main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress
in time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch
with causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the
wavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local
gradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most constrains
progress at each step. Previous algorithms have been restricted at each step by
the maximum wavespeed throughout the entire spacetime domain.

Sun-like star. To find a 1-Earth-mass planet in an Earthlike orbit, a precision
of 5 cm/s is necessary. The combination of a laser frequency comb with a
Fabry-Perot filtering cavity has been suggested as a promising approach to
achieve such Doppler shift resolution via improved spectrograph wavelength
calibration, with recent encouraging results. Here we report the fabrication of
such a filtered laser comb with up to 40- GHz (1-A) line spacing, generated
from a 1- GHz repetition-rate source, without compromising long-term stability,
reproducibility or spectral resolution. This wide-line-spacing comb, or
`astro-comb', is well matched to the resolving power of high-resolution
astrophysical spectrographs. The astro-comb should allow a precision as high as
1 cm/s in astronomical radial velocity measurements.

the design of randomized algorithms and has played an important role in several
nontrivial complexity upper bounds. On the other hand, polynomial identity
testing is a well-studied algorithmic problem with efficient randomized
algorithms and the problem of obtaining efficient \emph{deterministic} identity
tests has received a lot of attention recently. The goal of this note is to
compare the isolation lemma with polynomial identity testing: 1. We show that
derandomizing reasonably restricted versions of the isolation lemma implies
circuit size lower bounds. We derive the circuit lower bounds by examining the
connection between the isolation lemma and polynomial identity testing. We give
a randomized polynomial-time identity test for noncommutative circuits of
polynomial degree based on the isolation lemma. Using this result, we show that
derandomizing the isolation lemma implies noncommutative circuit size lower
bounds. The restricted versions of the isolation lemma we consider are natural
and would suffice for the standard applications of the isolation lemma. 2. From
the result of Klivans-Spielman \cite{KS01} we observe that there is a
randomized polynomial-time identity test for commutative circuits of polynomial
degree, also based on a more general isolation lemma for linear forms.
Consequently, derandomization of (a suitable version of) this isolation lemma
also implies circuit size lower bounds in the commutative setting.

rekindled the notion that shortly after their formation outside the snow line,
some planets may have migrated to the proximity of their host stars because of
their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. If these planets indeed
migrated to their present-day location, their survival would require a halting
mechanism in the proximity of their host stars. Most T Tauri stars have strong
magnetic fields which can clear out a cavity in the innermost regions of their
circumstellar disks and impose magnetic induction on the nearby young planets.
Here we consider the possibility that a magnetic coupling between young stars
and planets could quench the planet's orbital evolution. After a brief
discussion of the complexity of the full problem, we focus our discussion on
evaluating the permeation and ohmic dissipation of the time dependent component
of the stellar magnetic field in the planet's interior. Adopting a model first
introduced by C. G. Campbell for interacting binary stars, we determine the
modulation of the planetary response to the tilted magnetic field of a
non-synchronously spinning star. We first compute the conductivity in the young
planets, which indicates that the stellar field can penetrate well into the
planet's envelope in a synodic period. For various orbital configurations, we
show that the energy dissipation rate inside the planet is sufficient to induce
short-period planets to inflate. This process results in mass loss via Roche
lobe overflow and in the halting of the planet's orbital migration.

occurring across a wide range of length scales in the biological world has
spurred physicists in trying to understand such features using techniques from
statistical physics and non-linear dynamics. In this paper, we look at a few
examples of biological networks to see how similar questions can come up in
very different contexts. We review some of our recent work that looks at how
network structure (e.g., its connection topology) can dictate the nature of its
dynamics, and conversely, how dynamical considerations constrain the network
structure. We also see how networks occurring in nature can evolve to modular
configurations as a result of simultaneously trying to satisfy multiple
structural and dynamical constraints. The resulting optimal networks possess
hubs and have heterogeneous degree distribution similar to those seen in
biological systems.

environment) with an average per-bit complexity of just $O(N_tN_r)$, where
$N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the number of transmit and receive antennas,

receive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps/Hz
(using BPSK and rate-1/3 turbo code), our simulation results show that the
proposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 dB from theoretical
capacity. We also adopt the proposed detector for the low-complexity decoding
of high-rate non-orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) from division
algebras (DA). For example, we have decoded the $16\times 16$ full-rate
non-orthogonal STBC from DA using the proposed detector and show that it
performs close to within about 5.5 dB of the capacity using 4-QAM and rate-3/4
turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 24 bps/Hz. The practical feasibility of
the proposed high-performance low-complexity detector could potentially trigger
wide interest in the implementation of large MIMO systems. In large MC-CDMA
systems with hundreds of users, the proposed detector is shown to achieve near
single-user performance at an average per-bit complexity linear in number of
users, which is quite appealing for its use in practical CDMA systems.

framework in which theoretical quark star models could be tested by
observations. The key difference between polytropic quark stars and the
polytropic model studied previously for normal (i.e., non-quarkian) stars is
related to two issues: (i) a constant term representing the contribution of
vacuum energy may be added in the energy density and the pressure for a quark
star, but not for a normal star; (ii) the quark star models with non-vanishing
density at the stellar surface are not avoidable due to the strong interaction
between quarks. The first one implies that the vacuum inside a quark star is
different from that outside, while the second one is relevant to the effect of
color confinement. The polytropic equations of state are stiffer than that
derived in conventional realistic models (e.g., the bag model) for quark
matter, and pulsar-like stars calculated with a polytropic equation of state
could then have high maximum masses (> 2 M_sun). Quark stars can also be very
low massive, and be still gravitationally stable even if the polytropic index,
n, is greater than 3. All these would result in different mass-radius
relations, which could be tested by observations. In addition, substantial
strain energy would develop in a solid quark star during its accretion/spindown
phase, and could be high enough to take a star-quake. The energy released
during star-quakes could be as high as ~ 10^{47} ergs if the tangential
pressure is ~ 10^{-6} higher than the radial one.

broaden the commensurability resonances and displace them anisotropically.
These phenomena are unexpectedly weak but differ characteristically from
isotropic, Gaussian disorder in the antidot positions. The observations are
interpreted in terms of semiclassical trajectories which tend to localize along
the grain boundaries within certain magnetic field intervals. Furthermore, our
results indicate how the transport through superlattices generated by
self-organizing templates may get influenced by grain boundaries.

correlation that is more intuitive and flexible in cases where the tail
behavior of data is important. It measures nonlinear dependence where the
regular correlation coefficient is generally not applicable. One of its most
useful features is a test statistic that has high power when testing nonlinear
dependence in cases where the Fisher's $Z$-transformation test may fail to
reach a right conclusion. Unlike most asymptotic test statistics, which are
either normal or $\chi^2$, this test statistic has a limiting gamma
distribution (henceforth, the gamma test statistic). More than the common
usages of correlation, the quotient correlation can easily and intuitively be
adjusted to values at tails. This adjustment generates two new concepts--the
tail quotient correlation and the tail independence test statistics, which are
also gamma statistics. Due to the fact that there is no analogue of the
correlation coefficient in extreme value theory, and there does not exist an
efficient tail independence test statistic, these two new concepts may open up
a new field of study. In addition, an alternative to Spearman's rank
correlation, a rank based quotient correlation, is also defined. The advantages
of using these new concepts are illustrated with simulated data and a real data
analysis of internet traffic.

waves initiated by supernova explosions. The theory of diffusive shock

questions remain partly unanswered: what is the acceleration efficiency, i.e.
the fraction of the total supernova energy converted to cosmic-ray energy, and
what is the maximum kinetic energy achieved by particles accelerated in
supernova explosions? Recent observations of supernova remnants, in X-rays with
the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites and in very-high-energy gamma rays with
several ground-based atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes, have provided new pieces
of information concerning these two questions. After a review of these
observations and their current interpretations, I show that complementary
information on the diffusive shock acceleration process can be obtained by
studying the radio emission from extragalactic supernovae. As an illustration,
a nonlinear model of diffusive shock acceleration is applied to the radio light
curves of the supernova SN 1993J, which exploded in the nearby galaxy M81. The
results of the model suggest that most of the Galactic cosmic rays may be
accelerated during the early phase of interaction between the supernova ejecta
and the wind lost from the progenitor star.

\nu_L -> \nu_R -> \nu_L transition of supernova neutrinos may occur. The first
stage of such transition is due to the neutrino spin flip inside the hot dense
supernova core, while the second one - due to the neutrino spin precession in
the galactic magnetic field on the way from the supernova to terrestrial
detectors. This can result in the detection of 60-200 MeV neutrinos
simultaneously with the ""normal"" supernova neutrino signal, which would be a
smoking gun for the Dirac neutrino magnetic moment, \mu. We argue that in case
of a nearby supernova explosion (~10 kpc away from the Earth) one may observe
such high-energy events in Super-Kamiokande if \mu \gtrsim 10^{-13} \mu_B, and
in a Mt-scale detector if \mu \gtrsim 0.5*10^{-13} \mu_B. Such an observation
by itself, however, may be not sufficient to determine the value of the
magnetic moment, because of the ignorance of the interstellar magnetic field.
We point out that if in addition a deficit of the neutronization burst
neutrinos is established, it would be possible to extract the value of the
magnetic moment from observations. We also briefly discuss a possible Majorana
magnetic moment signature due to \nu_e -> \bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau} flip inside the

METHODS:We develop a restoration algorithm based on a method presented by
Walton & Preminger (1999). We apply this algorithm to data for both present-day
and archive CaII K full-disk observations, which were acquired using the PSPT
mounted at the Rome Observatory, or obtained by digitization of Mt Wilson
photographic-archive spectroheliograms. RESULTS:We show that the restoring
algorithm improves both spatial resolution and photometric contrast of the
analyzed solar observations. We find that the improvement in spatial resolution
is similar for analyzed recent and archive data. On the other hand, the
improvement of photometric contrast is quite poor for the archive data, with
respect to the one obtained for the present-day images. We show that the
quality of restored archive data depends on the photographic calibration
applied to the original observations. In particular, photometry can be
recovered with a restoring algorithm if the photographic-calibration preserves
the intensity information stored in the original data, principally outside the
solar-disk observations.

Different thresholding procedures are introduced for the estimation of the

function is only non-negligible in a limited region of the ambiguity plane. The
thresholds of the procedures are formally derived for each point in the plane,
and methods for the estimation of nuisance parameters that the thresholds

usually imposed on a continuous time multivariate square root process to ensure
that the roots have nonnegative arguments. For a discrete time approximate
model, the Feller conditions do not give this guarantee. Moreover, in a
macro-finance context the restrictions imposed might be economically
unappealing. At the same time, it has also been observed that even without the
Feller conditions imposed, for a practically relevant term structure model,
negative arguments rarely occur. Using models estimated on German data, we
compare the yields implied by (approximate) analytic exponentially affine
expressions to those obtained through Monte Carlo simulations of very high
numbers of sample paths. It turns out that the differences are rarely
statistically significant, whether the Feller conditions are imposed or not.

with linear filters for the estimation of the underlying trend of a time
series. The interest lies in the fact that the eigenvectors can be interpreted
as the latent components of any time series that the filter smooths through the
corresponding eigenvalues. A difficulty arises because matrices associated with
trend filters are finite approximations of Toeplitz operators and therefore
very little is known about their eigenstructure, which also depends on the
boundary conditions or, equivalently, on the filters for trend estimation at
the end of the sample. Assuming reflecting boundary conditions, we derive a
time series decomposition in terms of periodic latent components and
corresponding smoothing eigenvalues. This decomposition depends on the local
polynomial regression estimator chosen for the interior. Otherwise, the
eigenvalue distribution is derived with an approximation measured by the size
of the perturbation that different boundary conditions apport to the
eigenvalues of matrices belonging to algebras with known spectral properties,
such as the Circulant or the Cosine. The analytical form of the eigenvectors is
then derived with an approximation that involves the extremes only. A further
topic investigated in the paper concerns a strategy for a filter design in the
time domain. Based on cut-off eigenvalues, new estimators are derived, that are
less variable and almost equally biased as the original estimator, based on all
the eigenvalues. Empirical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

(kT>1 keV) X-ray emitting plasma. A ring-shaped structure, characterized by
high values of equivalent widths and median photon energy, encloses the PWN.
Its hard X-ray emission is spectrally characterized by a collisional ionization
equilibrium model, and strong emission lines of Mg, Si, and S, requiring
oversolar metal abundances. Dynamically, the location of the ejecta ring
suggests an SNR age of ~4,000 yr.
  The presence of overionized plasma in the inner regions of IC 443, addressed
in previous works, is much less evident in our observations.

the mass of the fermion is small. We also consider the phase structure for the

thermodynamically stable gapless modes for both fermions and anti fermions are
seen for strong coupling in the BEC regime. We further investigate the effect
of fluctuations of the condensate field by treating it as a dynamical field and
generalize the BCS ansatz to include quanta of the condensate field also in a
boson fermion model with quartic self interaction of the condensate field. It
is seen that the critical temperature decreases with inclusion of fluctuations.

In order to ensure identifiability of the model, we restrict our attention to
polynomially smooth, Sobolev-type densities $f$, with smoothness parameter
$\beta$. In this context, we first provide a consistent estimation procedure
for $s$. This estimator is then plugged-into three different procedures:
estimation of the unknown density $f$, of the functional $\int f^2$ and
goodness-of-fit test of the hypothesis $H_0:f=f_0$, where the alternative $H_1$
is expressed with respect to $\mathbb {L}_2$-norm (i.e. has the form
$\psi_n^{-2}\|f-f_0\|_2^2\ge \mathcal{C}$). These procedures are adaptive with
respect to both $s$ and $\beta$ and attain the rates which are known optimal
for known values of $s$ and $\beta$. As a by-product, when the noise density is
known and exponentially smooth our testing procedure is optimal adaptive for
testing Sobolev-type densities. The estimating procedure of $s$ is illustrated
on synthetic data.

equivalent to Hartree-Fock density matrix functional theory [M. Levy in {\it

D. Reidel, (1987)]. The implementation of the method consists of solving
Hartree-Fock equations and using the resulting orbitals to calculate two-body
corrections to account for correlation. The correction terms are constructed so
that the energy of the system in the absence of external potentials can be made
to correspond to approximate expressions for the energy of the homogeneous
electron gas. In this work the approximate expressions we use are based on the
high-density limit of the homogeneous electron gas. Self-interaction is
excluded from the two-body functional itself. It is shown that our pair density
