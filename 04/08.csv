10 representations and type II realization of the seesaw mechanism, the light
neutrino masses and the CP asymmetry needed for leptogenesis are controlled by
one and the same set of couplings. The generated baryon asymmetry then directly
depends on the low-energy neutrino parameters, with no unknown seesaw-scale
flavour parameters involved; in particular, the necessary CP violation is
provided by the CP-violating phases of the lepton mixing matrix. We compute the
CP asymmetry in triplet decays for this scenario and show that it can lead to
successful leptogenesis.

throughout the history of the universe. Thus, the string sourced anisotropy of
the cosmic microwave background is not affected by Silk damping as much as the
anisotropy seeded by inflation. The spectrum of perturbations generated by
strings does not match the observed CMB spectrum on large angular scales
(l<1000) and is bounded to contribute no more than 10% of the total power on
those scales. However, when this bound is marginally saturated, the anisotropy
created by cosmic strings on small angular scales l>2000 will dominate over
that created by the primary inflationary perturbations. This range of angular
scales in the CMB is presently being measured by a number of experiments; their
results will test this prediction of cosmic string networks soon.

still uncertain, but it should be associated either with the region of the

Pierre Auger Observatory was optimized for the highest energies. The surface
array is fully efficient above $3 \times 10^{18}$ eV and, even if the hybrid
mode can extend this range below $10^{18}$ eV, the second knee and a
considerable portion of the wide ankle structure are left outside its operating
range. Therefore, in order to encompass these spectral features and gain
further insight into the cosmic ray composition variation along the transition
region, enhancements to the surface and fluorescence components of the baseline
design are being implemented that will lower the full efficiency regime of the
Observatory down to $\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The surface enhancements consist of a
graded infilled area of standard Auger water Cherenkov detectors deployed in
two triangular grids of 433 m and 750 m of spacing. Each surface station inside
this area will have an associated muon counter detector. The fluorescence
enhancement, on the other hand, consists of three additional fluorescence
telescopes with higher elevation angle ($30^\circ-58^\circ$) than the ones in
operation at present. The aim of this paper is threefold. We study the effect
of the segmentation of the muon counters and find an analytical expression to
correct for the under counting due to muon pile-up. We also present a detailed
method to reconstruct the muon lateral distribution function for the 750 m

the P complexity class could be equivalent to the NP complexity class. Proof is
provided by demonstrating that as the number of clauses in a NP-complete
problem approaches infinity, the number of input sets processed per computation
performed also approaches infinity when solved by a polynomial time solution.
It is then possible to determine that the only deterministic optimization of a
NP-complete problem that could prove P = NP would be one that examines no more
than a polynomial number of input sets for a given problem.
  It is then shown that subdividing the set of all possible input sets into a

anisotropies in the CMB do not rule out the possibility that there is a large

the re-analysis of the curvaton scenario, paying special attention to the
compatibility of large non-gaussianity of the local type with the current
detection limits on the isocurvature amplitude in the CMB. We find that if the
curvaton mechanism generates a primordial power spectrum with an important
non-gaussian component, any residual isocurvature imprint originated by the
curvaton, would have an amplitude too big to be compatible with the current
bounds. This implies that the isocurvature mode should be equal to zero in this
scenario and we explore the consequences of this inference. In order to prevent
the generation of a such a signal, the CDM must be created at a late stage,
after the curvaton decays completely. This requirement is used to constrain the
nature of the CDM in this scenario, arriving at a general relation between the
temperature of the universe at CDM creation and the scale of inflation.

to analyze both baryonic components, combining X-ray and optical data of a
sample of five galaxy clusters (Abell 496, 1689, 2050, 2631 and 2667), within
the redshift range 0.03 < z < 0.3. We determined the contribution of stars in
galaxies and the intra-cluster medium to the total baryon budget. We used
public XMM-Newton data to determine the gas mass and to obtain the X-ray
substructures. Using the optical counterparts from SDSS or CFHT we determined
the stellar contribution. We examine the relative contribution of galaxies,
intra-cluster light and intra-cluster medium to baryon budget in clusters
through the stellar-to-gas mass ratio, estimated with use of recent data. We
find that the stellar-to-gas mass ratio within r_500 (the radius which the mean
cluster density exceeds the critical density by a factor of 500), is
anti-correlated with the ICM temperature, ranging from 24% to 6% whereas the
temperature ranges from 4.0 to 8.3 keV. This indicates that less massive cold
clusters are more prolific star forming environments than massive hot clusters.

A working manuscript",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex networks obtained from the real-world networks are often
characterized by incompleteness and noise, consequences of limited sampling as
well as artifacts in the acquisition process. Because the characterization,
analysis and modeling of complex systems underlain by complex networks are
critically affected by the quality of the respective initial structures, it
becomes imperative to devise methodologies for identifying and quantifying the
effect of such sampling problems on the characterization of complex networks.
Given that several measurements need to be applied in order to achieve a
comprehensive characterization of complex networks, it is important to
investigate the effect of incompleteness and noise on such quantifications. In
this article we report such a study, involving 8 different measurements applied
on 6 different complex networks models. We evaluate the sensitiveness of the
measurements to perturbations in the topology of the network considering the
relative entropy. Three particularly important types of progressive
perturbations to the network are considered: edge suppression, addition and
rewiring. The conclusions have important practical consequences including the
fact that scale-free structures are more robust to perturbations. The
measurements allowing the best balance of stability (smaller sensitivity to
perturbations) and discriminability (separation between different network
topologies) were also identified.

their practical use. When applied to the calculation of the day-night asymmetry

an accuracy better than 1% for the first order approximation. When the

further improved by almost one order of magnitude, and it is still better than
5% even for neutrino energies as large as 100 MeV. In the GeV regime

complemented by a good reproduction of the position of the maxima in the flavor

accumulate beneficial mutations, and hence to adapt. First, clonal interference
causes some beneficial mutations to be outcompeted by more-fit mutations which
occur in the same genetic background. Second, multiple mutations occur in some
individuals, so even mutations of large effect can be outcompeted unless they
occur in a good genetic background which contains other beneficial mutations.
In this paper, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to study how these two factors
influence the adaptation of asexual populations. We find that the results
depend qualitatively on the shape of the distribution of the effects of
possible beneficial mutations. When this distribution falls off slower than
exponentially, clonal interference alone reasonably describes which mutations
dominate the adaptation, although it gives a misleading picture of the
evolutionary dynamics. When the distribution falls off faster than
exponentially, an analysis based on multiple mutations is more appropriate.
Using our simulations, we are able to explore the limits of validity of both of
these approaches, and we explore the complex dynamics in the regimes where
neither are fully applicable.

information at relays, the receiver, and the transmitter if there is a direct
link between the transmitter and receiver. It is assumed that every node in the
network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol
is used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form
a beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers
according to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of
relays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically.
The complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays.
Our results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and
the optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any
value between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on
the quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels.
Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with
the aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own
channel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated
performance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and
outperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct
link are considered. We show that when the direct link exists during the first
step only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no
direct link. For networks with a direct link during the second step, recursive
numerical algorithms are proposed to solve the power control problem.
Simulation shows that by adjusting the transmitter and relays' powers
adaptively, network performance is significantly improved.

mag) UV emission from two Type II plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe) at z=0.185
and 0.324 discovered by the Supernova Legacy Survey. Optical photometry and VLT
spectroscopy 2 weeks after the GALEX detections link the onset of UV emission
to the time of shock breakout. Using radiation hydrodynamics and non-LTE
radiative transfer simulations, and starting from a standard red supergiant
(RSG; Type II-P SN progenitor) star evolved self-consistently from the main
sequence to iron core collapse, we model the shock breakout phase and the 55 hr
that follow. The small scale height of our RSG atmosphere model suggests that
the breakout signature is a thermal soft X-ray burst (lambda_peak ~ 90\AA) with
a duration of <~ 2000 s. Longer durations are possible but require either an
extended and tenuous non-standard envelope, or an unusually dense RSG wind with
\dot{M} ~ 10^(-3) Msun yr^(-1). The GALEX observations miss the peak of the
luminous (M_FUV ~ -20) UV burst but unambiguously capture the rise of the
emission and a subsequent 2 day long plateau. The postbreakout, UV-bright
plateau is a prediction of our model in which the shift of the peak of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) from ~100 to ~1000\AA and the ejecta
expansion both counteract the decrease in bolometric luminosity from ~10^11 to
~10^9 L_sun over that period. Based on the observed detection efficiency of our
study we make predictions for the breakout detection rate of the GALEX Time
Domain Survey.

changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by
phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and

fitting will work for maps with realistic yet idealised instrument response,
i.e., a response that includes only a uniform uv coverage as a function of
frequency and ignores many other uncertainties. Polarized galactic synchrotron
maps that include internal polarization and a number of Faraday screens along

a system of periodically kicked coupled-tops, where chaos and entanglement
arise from the same physical mechanism. The long-time averaged entanglement as
a function of the position of an initially localized wave packet very closely
correlates with the classical phase space surface of section -- it is nearly
uniform in the chaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the
regular islands. The uniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the
random state conjecture. As classically chaotic dynamics take localized
distributions in phase space to random distributions, quantized versions take
localized coherent states to pseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random
states are highly entangled, with an average value near that of the maximally
entangled state. For a map with global chaos, we derive that value based on new
analytic results for the typical entanglement in a subspace defined by the
symmetries of the system.
  For a mixed phase space, we use the Percival conjecture to identify a
""chaotic subspace"" of the Hilbert space. The typical entanglement, averaged
over the unitarily invariant Haar measure in this subspace, agrees with the
long-time averaged entanglement for initial states in the chaotic sea. In all
cases the dynamically generated entanglement is predicted by a unitary ensemble
of random states, even though the system is time-reversal invariant, and the
Floquet operator is a member of the circular orthogonal ensemble.

matter of fierce debate, yet only a few direct probes of magnetic field
strengths are available.
  Aims: The magnetic field is detected in a number of massive star-forming
regions through polarization observations of 6.7 GHz methanol masers. Although
these masers are the most abundant of the maser species occurring during
high-mass star formation, most magnetic field measurements in the high-density
gas currently come from OH and H2 O maser observations.
  Methods: The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to measure the Zeeman
splitting of 6.7 GHz methanol masers for the first time. The observations were
performed on a sample of 24 bright northern maser sources.
  Results: Significant Zeeman splitting is detected in 17 of the sources with
an average magnitude of 0.56 m/s . Using the current best estimate of the 6.7
GHz methanol maser Zeeman splitting coefficient and a geometrical correction,
this corresponds to an absolute magnetic field strength of 23 mG in the
methanol maser region.
  Conclusions: The magnetic field is dynamically important in the dense maser
regions. No clear relation is found with the available OH maser magnetic field
measurements. The general sense of direction of the magnetic field is
consistent with other Galactic magnetic field measurements, although a few of
the masers display a change of direction between different maser features. Due
to the abundance of methanol masers, measuring their Zeeman splitting provides
the opportunity to construct a comprehensive sample of magnetic fields in
high-mass star-forming regions.

an increase of the hadro-production cross section in low-energy e^+e^-
collisions could bridge the muon g-2 discrepancy, leading however to a decrease
on the electroweak upper bound on M_H, the SM Higgs boson mass. That bound is
currently M_H < ~ 150GeV (95%CL) based on the preliminary top quark mass M_t =

with the SWIFT/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), for a sample of nearby (z < 0.08)
Seyfert galaxies. For comparison, we have examined the relationship between the
[O III] 5007, the 2-10 keV and the 14-195 keV luminosities for the same set of

well-correlated with the BAT luminosities. On the other hand, the [O III]
luminosities are better-correlated with 2-10 keV luminosities than are those of
[O IV]. When comparing [O IV] and [O III] luminosities for the different types
of galaxies, we find that the Seyfert 2's have significantly lower [O III] to
[O IV] ratios than the Seyfert 1's. We suggest that this is due to more
reddening of the narrow line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2's. Assuming Galactic
dust to gas ratios, the average amount of extra reddening corresponds to a
hydrogen column density of ~ few times 10^21 cm^-2, which is a small fraction
of the X-ray absorbing columns in the Seyfert 2's. The combined effects of
reddening and the X-ray absorption are the probable reason why the [O III]
versus 2-10 keV correlation is better than the [O IV] versus 2-10 keV, since
the [O IV] emission line is much less affected by extinction. Overall, we find
the [O IV] to be an accurate and truly isotropic indicator of the power of the
AGN. This suggests that it can be useful in deconvolving the contribution of
the AGN and starburst to the spectrum of Compton-thick and/or X-ray weak

photometric survey given the parameters of the survey (nights observed,
bandpass, exposure time, telescope aperture, locations of the target fields,
observational conditions, and detector characteristics), as well as the
underlying planet properties (frequency, period and radius distributions).
Using our updated understanding of transit surveys provided by the experiences
of the survey teams, we account for those factors that have proven to have the
greatest effect on the survey yields. Specifically, we include the effects of
the surveys' window functions, adopt revised estimates of the giant planet
frequency, account for the number and distribution of main-sequence stars in
the survey fields, and include the effects of Galactic structure and
interstellar extinction. We approximate the detectability of a planetary
transit using a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) formulation. We argue that our
choice of detection criterion is the most uncertain input to our predictions,
and has the largest effect on the resulting planet yield. Thus drawing robust
inferences about the frequency of planets from transit surveys will require
that the survey teams impose and report objective, systematic, and quantifiable
detection criteria. Nevertheless, with reasonable choices for the minimum S/N,
we calculate yields that are generally lower, more accurate, and more realistic
than previous predictions. As examples, we apply our method to the
Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, the XO survey, and the {\it Kepler} mission.
We discuss red noise and its possible effects on planetary detections. We
conclude with estimates of the expected detection rates for future wide-angle

stars, i.e. modes for which the Coriolis force is dominant. This is done using
the assumption of a fixed spacetime (Cowling approximation). We present
frequencies and eigenfunctions for a sequence of stars with a polytropic
equation of state, covering a broad range of rotation rates. The modes were
obtained with a nonlinear general relativistic hydrodynamic evolution code. We
further show that the eigenequations for the oscillation modes can be written
in a particularly simple form for the case of arbitrary fast, but rigid
rotation. Using these equations, we investigate some general characteristics of
inertial modes, which are then compared to the numerically obtained
eigenfunctions. In particular, we derive a rough analytical estimate for the
frequency as a function of the number of nodes of the eigenfunction, and find
that a similar empirical relation matches the numerical results with unexpected
accuracy. We investigate the slow rotation limit of the eigenequations,
obtaining two different sets of equations describing pressure and inertial
modes. For the numerical computations we only considered axisymmetric modes,
while the analytic part also covers nonaxisymmetric modes. The eigenfunctions
suggest that the classification of inertial modes by the quantum numbers of the
leading term of a spherical harmonic decomposition is artificial in the sense
that the largest term is not strongly dominant, even in the slow rotation
limit. The reason for the different structure of pressure and inertial modes is
that the Coriolis force remains important in the slow rotation limit only for
inertial modes. Accordingly, the scalar eigenequation we obtain in that limit
is spherically symmetric for pressure modes, but not for inertial modes.

moving magnetic feature is newly formed near the penumbral boundary of

umbra that lack accompanying penumbral structures. These may be triggered by
the interaction of magnetic fields sweeped by convection with well-concentrated
magnetic flux. Another class of high speed downflows are observed in quiet sun
and sunspot moat regions. These are closely related to the formation of small

through a slab of left-handed media (LHM). This instability, which is inherent
only for LHM, originates from the backward Cherenkov radiation and results in a
self-modulation of the beams and radiation of electromagnetic waves. These
waves leave the sample via the rear surface of the slab (the beam injection
plane) and form two shifted bright circles centered at the beams. A simulated
spectrum of radiation has well-separated lines on top of a broad continuous
spectrum, which indicates dynamical chaos in the system. The radiation
intensity and its spectrum can be controlled either by the beams' current or by
the distance between the two beams.

processing (DSP), with the bulk of the receiver processing being performed on
digital signals obtained after analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). In this
paper, we explore Shannon-theoretic performance limits when ADC precision is
drastically reduced, from typical values of 8-12 bits used in current
communication transceivers, to 1-3 bits. The goal is to obtain insight on
whether DSP-centric transceiver architectures are feasible as communication
bandwidths scale up, recognizing that high-precision ADC at high sampling rates
is either unavailable, or too costly or power-hungry. Specifically, we evaluate
the communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC for the ideal real
discrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, under an average
power constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a
precision of log2 K bits), we show that the Shannon capacity is achievable by a
discrete input distribution with at most K + 1 mass points. For 2-bin (1-bit)
symmetric ADC, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling
is optimum for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit ADC, the capacity
is computed numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the
following encouraging observations regarding system design with low-precision
ADC : (a) even at moderately high SNR of up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization
results in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency, which is acceptable
for large communication bandwidths, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude
modulation with ADC thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard
decisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to
moderate SNRs as well.

Myr indicate that they were formed at the tip in advance of the formation of

damping, both of which are controlled by convection. Comparing observations
with theory should therefore improve our understanding of the underlying
physics. However, theoretical models invariably compute oscillation amplitudes
relative to the Sun, and it is therefore vital to have a good calibration of
the solar amplitude using stellar techniques. We have used daytime spectra of
the Sun, obtained with HARPS and UCLES, to measure the solar oscillations and
made a detailed comparison with observations using the BiSON helioseismology
instrument. We find that the mean solar amplitude measured using stellar
techniques, averaged over one full solar cycle, is 18.7 +/- 0.7 cm/s for the
strongest radial modes (l=0) and 25.2 +/- 0.9 cm/s for l=1. In addition, we use
simulations to establish an equation that estimates the uncertainty of
amplitude measurements that are made of other stars, given that the mode
lifetime is known. Finally, we also give amplitudes of solar-like oscillations
for three stars that we measured from a series of short observations with HARPS
(gamma Ser, beta Aql and alpha For), together with revised amplitudes for five
other stars for which we have previously published results (alpha Cen A, alpha

violated on real data, or may be at least relaxed. Under independence, we
propose an estimator $\hat{\pi}_0$ based on density estimation using both
histograms and cross-validation. Due to the strong connection between the false
discovery rate (FDR) and $\pi_0$, many multiple testing procedures (MTP)
designed to control the FDR may be improved by introducing an estimator of
$\pi_0$. We provide an example of such an improvement (plug-in MTP) based on
the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg. Asymptotic optimality results may be
derived for both $\hat{\pi}_0$ and the resulting plug-in procedure. The latter
ensures the desired asymptotic control of the FDR, while it is more powerful
than the BH-procedure. Finally, we compare our estimator of $\pi_0$ with other
widespread estimators in a wide range of simulations. We obtain better results
than other tested methods in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the proposed
estimator. Finally, both asymptotic optimality results and the interest in
tightly estimating $\pi_0$ are confirmed (empirically) by results obtained with
the plug-in MTP.

due to fluorescence by PAH molecules, in the spectra of Herbig Ae/Be stars and
link observed variations to spatial aspects of the mid-IR emission. We analysed
two PAH dominated spectra from a sample of 15 Herbig Ae/Be stars observed with
Spitzer and derive profiles of the major PAH bands. The shape and the measured
band characteristics show pronounced variations between the two Spitzer
spectra. Those variations parallel those found between three ISO spectra of
other, well-studied, Herbig Ae/Be stars. The derived profiles are compared to
those from a broad sample of sources. The Spitzer and ISO spectra exhibit
characteristics commonly interpreted respectively as interstellar matter-like
(ISM), non-ISM-like, or a combination of the two. We argue that the PAH
emission detected from the sources exhibiting a combination of ISM-like and
non-ISM-like characteristics indicates the presence of two dissimilar,
spatially separated, PAH families. As the shape of the individual PAH band
profiles reflects the composition of the PAH molecules involved, this
demonstrates that PAHs in subsequent, evolutionary linked stages of star
formation are different from those in the general ISM, implying active
chemistry. None of the detected PAH emission can be associated with the
(unresolved) disk and is thus associated with the circumstellar cloud. This
implies that chemical changes may already occur in the natal cloud and not
necessarily in the disk.

(semi-)hard trigger in heavy ion collisions has revealed a splitting of the
away side correlation structure in a low to intermediate transverse momentum
(P_T) regime. This is consistent with the assumption that energy deposited by
the away side parton into the bulk medium produced in the collision excites a
sonic shockwave (a Mach cone) which leads to away side correlation strength at
large angles. A prediction following from assuming such a hydrodynamical origin
of the correlation structure is that there is a sizeable elongation of the
shockwave in rapidity due to the longitudinal expansion of the bulk medium.
Using a single hadron trigger, this cannot be observed due to the unconstrained
rapidity of the away side parton. Using a dihadron trigger, the rapidity of the
away side parton can be substantially constrained and the longitudinal
structure of the away side correlation becomes accessible. However, in such
events several effects occur which change the correlation structure
substantially: There is not only a sizeable contribution due to the
fragmentation of the emerging away side parton, but also a systematic bias
towards small energy deposition into the medium and hence a weak shockwave. In
this paper, both effects are addressed.

chiral unitary approach. The leading order meson-baryon interaction, used as
the kernel of the unitarization procedure, manifests a nontrivial $N_c$
dependence of the flavor SU(3) representation for baryons. As a consequence,
the SU(3) singlet (or $\bar{K}N$) component of the $\Lambda(1405)$ states
remains bound in the large $N_c$ limit, while the other components dissolve
into the continuum. Introducing explicit SU(3) breaking, we obtain the $N_c$

width is found to be different from the general counting rule for a $qqq$

projected rotational velocity of 350 km/s. Despite the wealth of published
observations, the nature of this object and its dust-rich surroundings is not
well understood. With the present paper, we shed light on the geometrical
structure of the circumstellar matter which produces the near- to mid-infrared
flux excess, and construct an overall image of the source's appearance and
evolutionary status. The H-, K- and N-band brightness distribution of MWC 297
is probed with the ESO interferometric spectrographs AMBER and MIDI. We have
obtained visibility measurements on 3 AMBER and 12 MIDI baselines, covering a
wide range of spatial frequencies. We have reconstructed the brightness
distribution in H, K and N with a geometric model consisting of three Gaussian
disks with different extent and brightness temperature. This model can account
for the entire near- to mid-IR emission of MWC 297. The near- and mid-IR
emission, including the silicate emission at 10 micron, emanates from a very
compact region (FWHM < 1.5 AU) around the central star. We argue that the
circumstellar matter in the MWC 297 system is organized in a disk, seen under
moderate (i < 40 deg) inclination. The disk displays no inner emission-free gap
at the resolution of our interferometric data. The low inclination of the disk
implies that the actual rotational velocity of the star exceeds its critical
velocity. We discuss the impact of this result in terms of the formation of
high-mass stars, and the main-sequence evolution of classical Be stars.

primary at birth was updated. Conservative evolution fails to produce the large
fraction with a high mass ratio: i.e. q in [0.4-0.6]. Interacting binaries thus
have to lose mass before or during Algolism. During RLOF mass is transferred
continuously from donor to gainer. The gainer spins up; sometimes up to
critical velocity. Equatorial material on the gainer is therefore less bound to
the system. The material coming from the donor through the first Langrangian
point impinges violently on the surface of the gainer or the edge of the
accretion disc, creating a hot spot in the area of impact. The sum of
rotational energy (fast rotation) and radiative energy (hot spot) depends on
the mass-loss rate. The sum of both energies on a test mass located in the
impact area equals exactly its binding energy at some critical value. As long
as the mass transfer rate is smaller than this value the gainer accepts all the
mass coming from the donor: RLOF happens conservatively. But as soon as the
critical rate is exceeded the gainer will acquire no more than the critical
value and RLOF runs into its liberal era. Low mass binaries never achieve
mass-loss rates larger than the critical value. Intermediate mass binaries
evolve mainly conservatively but mass will be blown away from the system during
the short era of rapid mass transfer soon after RLOF-ignition. Binaries with
9+5.4 solar masses (P in [2-4] d) evolve almost always conservatively. Only
during some 20,000 years the gainer is not capable of grasping all the material
that comes from the donor. During this short lapse of time a significant
fraction of the mass of the system is blown into interstellar space. The mass
ratio bin [0.4-0.6] is now much better represented.

causes a significant drop in the elastic and viscous moduli due to structural
rearrangements that ease flow. For the same reason the critical (peak of G'')
and crossover (overlap of G' and G'') strain are smaller in the crystal
compared to the glass at the same volume fraction. When, however the distance
from the maximum packing in each state is taken into account the elastic
modulus of the crystal is found to be larger than the glass at the same free

shear induced crystals counter-intuitively exhibit similar rheological ageing
to the glass (with a logarithmic increase of G'), indicating that the shear

are thought to contain white dwarfs which have a magnetic field strength in the
range ~0.1-10MG. A significant fraction of the X-ray sources detected in recent
deep surveys has been postulated to consist of IPs. Until now two of the
defining characteristics of IPs have been the presence of high (and complex)
absorption in their X-ray spectra and the presence of a stable modulation in
the X-ray light curve which is a signature of the spin period, or the beat
period, of the accreting white dwarf. Three CVs, V426 Oph, EI UMa and LS Peg,
have characteristics which are similar to IPs. However, there has been only
tentative evidence for a coherent period in their X-ray light curve. We present
the results of a search for coherent periods in XMM-Newton data of these
sources using an auto-regressive analysis which models the effects of
red-noise. We confirm the detection of a ~760 sec period in the soft X-ray
light curve of EI UMa reported by Reimer et al and agree that this represents
the spin period. We also find evidence for peaks in the power spectrum of each
source in the range 100-200 sec which are just above the 3sigma confidence
level. We do not believe that they represent genuine coherent modulations.
However, their X-ray spectra are very similar to those of known IPs. We believe
that all three CVs are bona fide IPs. We speculate that V426 Oph and LS Peg do
not show evidence for a spin period since they have closely aligned magnetic
and spin axes. We discuss the implications that this has for the defining
characteristics of IPs.

distinguishing among galaxies belonging to different substructures and deriving

in the cluster region, of which 134 belonging to the cluster; ii) derive the
cluster NIR luminosity function; iii) study the Kormendy relation and the
photometric plane of cluster early-type galaxies (ETGs). Finally we provide an
extensive photometric (optical and NIR) and spectroscopic dataset for such a
complex system to be used in further analyses investigating the nature,
formation and evolution of rich clusters of galaxies. The observational
scenario confirms that ABCG 209 is presently undergoing strong dynamical
evolution with the merging of two or more subclumps. This interpretation is
also supported by the detection of a radio halo (Giovannini et al. 2006)
suggesting that there is a recent or ongoing merging. Cluster ETGs follow a
Kormendy relation whose slope is consistent with previous studies both at
optical and NIR wavelengths. We investigate the origin of the intrinsic scatter
of the photometric plane due to trends of stellar populations, using line
indices as indicators of age, metallicity and alpha/Fe enhancement. We find
that the chemical evolution of galaxies could be responsible for the intrinsic
dispersion of the Photometric Plane.

fb^-1 for the two cases M_H+- < m_t and M_H+- > m_t. The results are
interpreted as 5 sigma discovery contours in M_H+- - tan_beta planes of the
MSSM for various benchmark scenarios. We study the dependence of the 5 sigma
contours on the variation of the relevant SUSY parameters. Particular emphasis
is put on analyzing the variation of the discovery contours with the Higgs
mixing parameter mu. The variation of mu can shift the prospective discovery
reach in tan_beta by up to Delta tan_beta = 40.

against re-orientation of their magnetization, the so-called magnetic
anisotropy energy, MAE. The height of this barrier is important for
technological applications, as it determines, e.g., the stability of

relativistic density functional calculations. Our approach is based on a
full-potential local-orbital method (FPLO) in a four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham

orbital dependent density functionals. Ground state properties (spin

equipartition field $B_e$, corresponding to a magnetic energy density that
matches the kinetic energy density of photospheric convection, and comparable
with the field $B_p$ that exerts a magnetic pressure equal to the ambient gas
pressure. We present an idealised numerical model of three-dimensional
compressible magnetoconvection at the photosphere, for a range of values of the
magnetic Reynolds number. In the absence of a magnetic field, the convection is
highly supercritical and is characterised by a pattern of vigorous,
time-dependent, ``granular'' motions. When a weak magnetic field is imposed
upon the convection, magnetic flux is swept into the convective downflows where
it forms localised concentrations. Unless this process is significantly
inhibited by magnetic diffusion, the resulting fields are often much greater
than $B_e$, and the high magnetic pressure in these flux elements leads to
their being partially evacuated. Some of these flux elements contain
ultra-intense magnetic fields that are significantly greater than $B_p$. Such
fields are contained by a combination of the thermal pressure of the gas and
the dynamic pressure of the convective motion, and they are constantly
evolving. These ultra-intense fields develop owing to nonlinear interactions
between magnetic fields and convection; they cannot be explained in terms of
``convective collapse'' within a thin flux tube that remains in overall
pressure equilibrium with its surroundings.

neighborhood. Young, stellar samples, selected according to their activity, can
be used to determine the stellar birthrate in the last billion years. The ROSAT
North Ecliptic Pole survey (NEP), with its moderately deep sensitivity (fluxes
~10^(-14) erg cm^(-2) sec^(-1)), is the best survey, to date, able to sample
the intermediate-age (10^8 - 10^9 years) nearby population. The identification
process of NEP X-ray sources resulted in 144 X-ray sources having a normal
stellar counterpart, with an excess of yellow stars with respect to model
predictions. We want to determine if these X-ray active stars are young or
intermediate-age stars, or active binaries. We acquired high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra, to determine the age and physical
properties of the NEP X-ray-detected stellar sources. We measure the (i)
lithium abundance using the Li I 6707.8 angstrom line, which is an excellent,
youth indicator for our age range of interest; (ii) rotational and radial
velocities (through cross-correlation methods); and (iii) chromospheric
emission. The radial velocities distribution is consistent with that of a young
field star population of age 4x10^9 yrs, or younger. Rotational velocity
measurements imply that our sample is dominated by relatively young or
intermediate-age stars, as confirmed by our lithium measurements. Most of the
detected stars probably belong to a young or intermediate-age population. Our
measurements suggest that a burst in the stellar birthrate of a factor of four
occurred in the last 10^8 years. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility
that a small fraction of sources, amongst the fastest of the K-rotators, are
old binary systems with tidally-locked rotation.

The temperature dependence of the NMR shift $K(T)$ is well described by the
$S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain (HAF) model with nearest neighbor
exchange $J_{1}$ $\simeq $ $(141\pm 5)$ K. The corresponding mapping of an
LDA-derived tight-binding model leads to $J_{1}^{LDA}$ $\simeq$ 196 K. The spin
lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ decreases with temperature below 300 K but
becomes nearly temperature independent between 30 K and 2 K as theoretically
expected for an $S = {1/2}$ HAF chain. None of the investigated properties give
any evidence for long range magnetic order above 2K, in agreement with the
results of the band structure calculation, which yield extremely weak exchange
to the next nearest neighbor (NNN) and a very small and frustrated inter-chain
exchange. Thus, K$_{2}$CuP$_{2}$O$_{7}$ seems to be a better realization of a
nearest neighbor $S = {1/2}$ HAF chain than the compounds reported so far.

G(N,p) graphs becomes infeasible, and cheaper random-looking distributions

the membrane folding transition. While at times, larger than the characteristic
membrane relaxation time $\tau_R$, the mean-square displacement of the center
of mass of the sheet, $<R_c^2>$, as well as that of its central node,
$<R_n^2>$, show the normal Rouse diffusive behavior with a diffusion
coefficient $D_N$ scaling as $D_N \propto N^{-1}$ with respect to the number of
segments $N$ in the membrane, for short times $t\le \tau_R$ we observe a {\em
multiscale dynamics} of the central node, $<R_n^2> \propto t^\alpha$, where the
anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ changes from $\alpha \approx 0.86$ to
$\alpha \approx 0.27$, and then to $\alpha \approx 0.5$, before diffusion turns
eventually to normal. By means of simple scaling arguments we show that our
main result, $\alpha \approx 0.27$, can be related to particular mechanisms of
membrane dynamics which involve different groups of segments in the membrane
sheet. A comparative study involving also linear polymers demonstrates that the
diffusion coefficient of self-avoiding tethered membranes, containing $N$
segments, is three times smaller than that of linear polymer chains with the

the first order formalism (FOF) are physically acceptable: they may describe
topology changes (Horowitz) and reduction of ""metrical dimension"" (Tseytlin) of
space-time. The latter implies disappearance of the volume element
$\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ of 4-D space-time. We pay attention that besides $\sqrt{-g}$,
the 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a ""manifold volume
measure"" (MVM)described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically
independent of the metric. The FOF proceeds with originally independent
connection and metric structures of the space-time manifold. We bring up the
question whether the FOF should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of MVM.
Adding such manifold degrees of freedom to the action principle in the FOF we
realize very interesting dynamics. Such Two Measures Theory enables radically
new approaches to resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We show that
fine tuning free solutions describing a transition to $\Lambda =0$ state
involve oscillations of $g_{\mu\nu}$ and MVM around zero. The latter can be
treated as a dynamics involving changes of orientation of the space-time
manifold. As we have shown earlier, in realistic scale invariant models (SIM),
solutions formulated in the Einstein frame satisfy all existing tests of
General Relativity (GR). Here we reveal surprisingly that in SIM, all ground
state solutions with $\Lambda\neq 0$ appear to be degenerate either in $g_{00}$
or in MVM. Sign indefiniteness of MVM in a natural way yields a dynamical
realization of a phantom cosmology ($w<-1$). For all solutions, the metric
tensor rewritten in the Einstein frame has regularity properties exactly as in
GR. A possibility of a strong gravity effect in LHC experiments is discussed.

The atmospheric parameters were determined in a quantitative spectral analysis.
Based on high resolution spectra we were able to measure the projected

projected rotational velocities signs of tidal locking with the companions are
visible. By detecting ellipsoidal variations in the lightcurve of an sdB binary
we were able to show that subdwarf binaries with orbital periods up to 0.6 d
are most likely synchronized. In this case, the inclination angles and
companion masses of the binaries can be tightly constrained. Five invisible
companions have masses that are compatible with that of normal white dwarfs or
late type main sequence stars. However, four sdBs have compact companions
massive enough to be heavy white dwarfs (>1 Msun), neutron stars or even black
holes. Such a high fraction of massive compact companions is not expected from

Baade's Window. These giants span a factor of 10 in metallicity and this is the
first study to define the behavior of 19F with metallicity in the bulge. The
bulge results show an increase in F/O with increasing oxygen. This trend
overlaps what is found in the disk at comparable metallicities, with the most
oxygen-rich bulge target extending the disk trend. The increase in F/O in the
disk arises from 19F synthesis in both asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
metal-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars through stellar winds. The lack of an
s-process enhancement in the most fluorine-rich bulge giant in this study,
suggests that WR stars represented a larger contribution than AGB stars to 19F
production in the bulge when compared to the disk. If this result for fluorine
is combined with the previously published overall decline in the O/Mg abundance
ratios in metal-rich bulge stars, it suggests that WR winds played a role in
shaping chemical evolution in the bulge. One star in this study exhibits a very
low value of F/O while having a large O-abundance; this chemical mixture can be
understood if this star formed from gas that was enriched by metal-poor
core-collapse supernovae and may indicate that chemical evolution in the bulge
was inhomogeneous.

hot, radiative atmosphere of these stars are the most likely explanation.
Although several attempts were made, it was not yet possible to model all the
observed features of sdB atmospheres. A setback of most prior studies was the
small sample size. We present a detailed abundance analysis of 68 sdBs. From
high resolution spectra obtained with the VLT/UVES instrument in the course of
the ESO Supernova Progenitor Survey (SPY) we measured elemental abundances of
up to 24 different ions per star. A general trend of enrichment was found with
increasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. The lighter elements
like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted irrespective of the temperature.
Although there is considerable scatter from one star to another, the general
abundance patterns in most sdBs are similar. An interplay between gravitational
settling, radiative levitation and weak winds is most likely responsible. About
6 % of the analysed stars show an enrichment in carbon and helium which cannot
be explained in the framework of diffusion alone. Nuclear processed material
must have been transported to the surface. The late hot-flasher scenario may

observed variability of polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation,
we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with values ranging from 8.8
d (for HD 190771) to 22.7 d (for HD 146233). Apart from rotation, fundamental
parameters of the selected objects are very close to the Sun's, making this
sample a practical basis to investigate the specific impact of rotation on
magnetic properties of Sun-like stars.
  We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the targets as a
low-order (l<10) spherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field.
  From the set of magnetic maps, we draw two main conclusions. (a) The magnetic
energy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate. The increase of
chromospheric emission with the mean magnetic field is flatter than observed in
the Sun. Since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elements
smaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observation
suggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored in
large scales as rotation increases. (b) Whereas the magnetic field is mostly
poloidal for low rotation rates, more rapid rotators host a large-scale
toroidal component in their surface field. From our observations, we infer that
a rotation period lower than ~12 days is necessary for the toroidal magnetic
energy to dominate over the poloidal component.

this data a star product on $(M,\P)$ given by a series of bidifferential
operators whose corresponding tensors are given by universal polynomial
expressions in the Poisson tensor $\P$, the curvature tensor $R$ and their

the l1-norm, a problem usually referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we
present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso. For
various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic
equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i.e., variable
selection). For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the
variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one
exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive
probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for
several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the
supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection.
This novel variable selection algorithm, referred to as the Bolasso, is
compared favorably to other linear regression methods on synthetic data and
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

brain are dominated by autonomous dynamical processes, that is by a
self-sustained activity which would be present even in the absence of external
sensory stimuli.
  During normal operation the continuous influx of external stimuli could
therefore be completely unrelated to the patterns generated internally by the
autonomous dynamical process. Learning of spurious correlations between
external stimuli and autonomously generated internal activity states needs
therefore to be avoided.
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
internal activity, that is for an autonomous activity characterized by a
infinite time-series of transiently stable attractor states. We propose that
external stimuli will be relevant during the sensitive periods, the transition
period between one transient state and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A
diffusive learning signal is generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus
influences the internal dynamics qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to
the bar-stripes problem and found it capable to perform the required
independent-component analysis on its own, all the time being continuously and
autonomously active.

side lengths. We consider plane integral point sets $\mathcal{P}$, which are
sets of $n$ points in the plane with pairwise integral distances where not all
the points are collinear.
  The largest occurring distance is called its diameter. Naturally the question
about the minimum possible diameter $d(2,n)$ of a plane integral point set
consisting of $n$ points arises. We give some new exact values and describe
state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain them. It turns out that plane integral
point sets with minimum diameter consist very likely of subsets with many
collinear points. For this special kind of point sets we prove a lower bound
for $d(2,n)$ achieving the known upper bound $n^{c_2\log\log n}$ up to a
constant in the exponent.
  A famous question of Erd\H{o}s asks for plane integral point sets with no 3
points on a line and no 4 points on a circle. Here, we talk of point sets in
general position and denote the corresponding minimum diameter by
$\dot{d}(2,n)$. Recently $\dot{d}(2,7)=22 270$ could be determined via an
exhaustive search.

Gravity (QEG) on an infinite dimensional theory space. We consider ""conformally
reduced"" gravity where only fluctuations of the conformal factor are quantized
and employ the Local Potential Approximation for its effective average action.
The requirement of ""background independence"" in quantum gravity entails a
partial differential equation governing the scale dependence of the potential
for the conformal factor which differs significantly from that of a scalar
matter field. In the infinite dimensional space of potential functions we find
a Gaussian as well as a non-Gaussian fixed point which provides further
evidence for the viability of the asymptotic safety scenario. The analog of the
invariant cubic in the curvature which spoils perturbative renormalizability is
seen to be unproblematic for the asymptotic safety of the conformally reduced
theory. The scaling fields and dimensions of both fixed points are obtained
explicitly and possible implications for the predictivity of the theory are
discussed. Spacetime manifolds with $R^d$ as well as $S^d$ topology are
considered. Solving the flow equation for the potential numerically we obtain
examples of renormalization group trajectories inside the ultraviolet critical
surface of the non-Gaussian fixed point. The quantum theories based upon some
of them show a phase transition from the familiar (low energy) phase of gravity
with spontaneously broken diffeomorphism invariance to a new phase of unbroken
diffeomorphism invariance; the latter phase is characterized by a vanishing
expectation value of the metric.
