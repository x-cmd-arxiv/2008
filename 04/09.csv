that is stable under multiplication by scalars of absolute value 1. A {\em
maximal vector} (for $V$) is a unit vector $\xi\in H$ whose distance to $V$ is
maximum $d(\xi,V)=\sup_{\|\eta\|=1}d(\eta,V)$, $d(\xi,V)$ denoting the distance
from $\xi$ to the set $V$. Maximal vectors generalize the {\em maximally
entangled} unit vectors of quantum theory.
  In general, under a mild regularity hypothesis on $V$, there is a {\em norm}
on $H$ whose restriction to the unit sphere achieves its minimum precisely on
$V$ and its maximum precisely on the set of maximal vectors. This
""entanglement-measuring norm"" is unique. There is a corresponding
""entanglement-measuring norm"" on the predual of $\mathcal B(H)$ that faithfully
detects entanglement of normal states.
  We apply these abstract results to the analysis of entanglement in
multipartite tensor products $H=H_1\otimes ...\otimes H_N$, and we calculate
both entanglement-measuring norms. In cases for which $\dim H_N$ is relatively
large with respect to the others, we describe the set of maximal vectors in
explicit terms and show that it does not depend on the number of factors of the
Hilbert space $H_1\otimes...\otimes H_{N-1}$.

the scaling of mean exit time. Previous work has defined the voter model in
terms of an initially chosen node and a randomly chosen neighbor, which makes
it difficult to disentangle the effects of the stochastic process itself

that selects a pair of interacting nodes and one that determines the direction
of interaction as a function of the degrees of the two nodes and a parameter
$\alpha$ which sets the likelihood of the higher degree node giving its state.
Traditional voter model behavior can be recovered within the model. We find
that on a complete bipartite network, the traditional voter model is the
fastest process. On a random network with power law degree distribution, we
observe two regimes. For modest values of $\alpha$, exit time is dominated by
diffusive drift of the system state, but as the high nodes become more
influential, the exit time becomes becomes dominated by frustration effects.
For certain selection processes, a short intermediate regime occurs where exit
occurs after exponential mixing.

rotation velocity (Vrot sin i) and the period of the star: Vrot sin i = (11.5

in observational asymmetry curves (noted gamma_O), related to the period of the

The particle energy distribution function is split in two components: the radio
one connected to a relic population born at the outburst of the supernova and
the other associated to the wind population continuously accelerated at the
termination shock and emitting up to the gamma-ray band. We consider the
general Klein-Nishina cross section and three different photon targets: the
nebular synchrotron photons, far-infrared thermal ones and the cosmic microwave
background. The overall synchrotron spectrum is fitted assuming an excess of
injected particles and a steeper power law with respect to previous models. The
TeV emission has the correct shape but is in excess of the data. This is due to
the nebular magnetic field structure as obtained by the simulations. The

have been used to validate a spectroscopic method of determining the projection
factor. This method, based on the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, is
applied to eight stars observed with the HARPS spectrometer. The projection
factor is divided into three sub-concepts : (1) a geometrical effect, (2) the
velocity gradient within the atmosphere, and (3) the relative motion of the

line: p = [0.064 +- 0.020] log P + [1.376 +- 0.023]. This procedure is then
extended to derive dynamic projection factors for any spectral line of any

calibration of the period-luminosity relation of Cepheids. Moreover, it reveals
a new physical quantity fo-g to investigate in the near future.

velocity, or gamma-velocity, which shows a systematic blueshift of about 2 km/s
compared to an axisymmetric rotation model of the Milky Way. This term is
either related to the space motion of the star and, consequently, to the
kinematic structure of our Galaxy, or it is the result of the dynamical
structure of the Cepheids' atmosphere. We aim to show that these residual
gamma-velocities are an intrinsic property of Cepheids. We observed nine
galactic Cepheids with the HARPS spectroscope, focusing specifically on 17
spectral lines. For each spectral line of each star, we computed the
gamma-velocity (resp. gamma-asymmetry) as an average value of the interpolated
radial velocity (resp. line asymmetry) curve. For each Cepheid in our sample, a
linear relation is found between the gamma-velocities of the various spectral
lines and their corresponding gamma-asymmetries, showing that residual
gamma-velocities stem from the intrinsic properties of Cepheids. We also
provide a physical reference to the stellar gamma-velocity: it should be zero
when the gamma-asymmetry is zero. Following this definition, we provide very
precise and physically calibrated estimates of the gamma-velocities for all
stars of our sample. To understand this very subtle gamma-asymmetry effect,
further numerical studies are needed. Cepheids' atmosphere are strongly
affected by pulsational dynamics, convective flows, nonlinear physics, and
complex radiative transport. Hence, all of these effects have to be
incorporated simultaneously and consistently into the numerical models to
reproduce the observed line profiles in detail.

Ginzburg-Landau theory describes superconductivity by defining a complex order
parameter and applying Landau's theory for phase transitions. However, there is
no local, gauge invariant order parameter for a superconductor and classical
order is no appropriate description. Topological order has proven to be a
powerful tool for describing the Quantum Hall effect and it gives also an
appropriate description of s-wave superconductors. For d-wave superconductors
there are gapless excitations at four points on the Fermi surface. The
topological theory for superconductors exhibits a similar structure for the
ground state as found in the s-wave case. However, the gapless excitations
destroy the topological degeneracy of the ground state and introduce an
additional degeneracy in one of the flux sectors. In search for regularities
which reflect the topological order, I include a magnetic point impurity and

uniaxial magnetic anisotropy contribution can be inverted from the [110] to the

magnetoelastic term is a minor contribution to the magnetic anisotropy.
Nevertheless, we show that the switching fields of rho(H) loops are shifted as
a function of V_p at this temperature. At 50K - where the magnetoelastic term
dominates the magnetic anisotropy - we are able to tune the magnetization
orientation by about 70 degree solely by means of the electrical voltage V_p
applied. Furthermore, we derive the magnetostrictive constant lambda_111 as a
function of temperature and find values consistent with earlier results. We
argue that the piezo-voltage control of magnetization orientation is directly
transferable to other ferromagnetic/piezoelectric hybrid structures, paving the
way to innovative multifunctional device concepts. As an example, we
demonstrate piezo-voltage induced irreversible magnetization switching at

of two tricritical points along the same critical frontier. To our knowledge,
it is the first time that such a behavior is verified for a spin-glass model in
the presence of a continuous-distribution random field, which represents a
typical situation of a real system. The stability of the replica-symmetric
solution is analyzed, and the usual Almeida-Thouless instability is verified
for low temperatures. It is verified that, the higher-temperature tricritical
point always appears in the region of stability of the replica-symmetric
solution; a condition involving the parameters $H_{0}$ and $\sigma$, for the
occurrence of this tricritical point only, is obtained analytically. Some of
our results are discussed in view of experimental measurements available in the
literature.

The latter is readily checkable numerically, and analytically verifiable in
certain favorable cases; in particular, it has been shown by Costanzino,
Humpherys, Nguyen, and Zumbrun to hold for sufficiently large-amplitude layers
for isentropic ideal gas dynamics, with general adiabiatic index $\gamma \ge

stability of large-amplitude isentropic boundary layers, the first such result
for compressive (``shock-type'') layers in other than the nearly-constant case.
The analysis, as in the strictly parabolic case, proceeds by derivation of
detailed pointwise Green function bounds, with substantial new technical
difficulties associated with the more singular, hyperbolic behavior in the

spherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric MHD simulations. In low
collisionality plasmas, the Bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable to
the magnetothermal instability (MTI). The MTI grows rapidly at large radii
where the inflow is subsonic. For a weak initial field, the MTI saturates by
creating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e., by aligning the field lines
with the background temperature gradient. The saturation is quasilinear in the
sense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\sim 10-30$
independent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). In the saturated
state, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux,
and is comparable to the field-free (Spitzer) value (since the field lines are
largely radial). The MTI by itself does not appreciably change the accretion
rate $\dot M$ relative to the Bondi rate $\dot M_B$. However, the radial field
lines created by the MTI are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows in
to small radii. Oppositely directed field lines are brought together by the
converging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. When the magnetic
energy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, the
plasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highly
subsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large
radii by thermal conduction; and the accretion rate $\dot M \ll \dot M_B$. The
predominantly radial magnetic field created by the MTI at large radii in
spherical accretion flows may account for the stable Faraday rotation measure
towards Sgr A* in the Galactic Center.

of AGN host galaxies, we have simulated more than 50,000 ACS images of galaxies
with z < 1.25, using image and noise properties appropriate for the GOODS
survey. We test the effect of central point-source brightness on host galaxy
parameter recovery with a set of simulated AGN host galaxies made by adding
point sources to the centers of normal galaxies. We extend this analysis and
also quantify the recovery of intrinsic morphological parameters of AGN host
galaxies with a set of fully simulated inactive and AGN host galaxies.
  We can reliably separate good from poor fit results using a combination of
reasonable error cuts, in the regime where L_{host}:L_{PS} > 1:4. We give
quantitative estimates of parameter errors as a function of
host-to-point-source ratio. In general, we separate host and point-source
magnitudes reliably at all redshifts; point sources are well recovered more
than 90% of the time, although spurious detection of central point sources can
be as high as 25% for bulge-dominated sources. We find a general correlation
between Sersic index and intrinsic bulge-to-total ratio, such that a host
galaxy with Sersic n < 1.5 generally has at least 80% of its light from a disk
component. Likewise, ""bulge-dominated"" galaxies with n > 4 typically derive at
least 70% of their total host galaxy light from a bulge, but this number can be
as low as 55%. Single-component Sersic fits to an AGN host galaxy are
statistically very reliable to z < 1.25 (for ACS survey data like ours). In
contrast, two-component fits involving separate bulge and disk components tend
to over-estimate the bulge fraction by ~10%, with uncertainty of order 50%.

Cool Dwarf (UCD) primary with a spectral type between M8 and L0.5. This system
was discovered during the course of an ongoing survey to monitor L dwarfs for
radial velocity variations and is the first known small separation (a<1 AU)
spectroscopic binary among dwarfs at the M/L transition. Based on
radial-velocity measurements with a typical precision of 300 m/s we estimate
the orbital parameters of this system to be P=246.73+/-0.49 d, a1
sin(i)=0.159+/-0.003 AU, M2 sin(i)=0.2062 (M1+M2)^(2/3)+/-0.0034 M_{\sun}.
Assuming a primary mass of M1=0.08M_{\sun} (based on spectral type), we
estimate the secondary minimum mass to be M2 sin(i)=0.054 M_{\sun}. With future
photometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric observations it may be possible
to determine the dynamical masses of both components directly, making this
system one of the best characterized UCD binaries known.

Mon, which is located about 20 arcminutes northwest of the Cone Nebula near the
center of the open cluster NGC 2264. This object, according to its most recent
optical spectral type determination (B7), which we confirmed, is at least 3
magnitudes too faint in V for the cluster distance, but it shows the classical
signs of a young pre-main sequence object, such as highly variable Halpha
emission, Mg II emission, IR excess, UV continuum, and optical variability. We
analyzed a collection of archival and original data on Walker 90, covering 45
years including photometry, imaging, and spectroscopic data ranging from
ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. According to star formation
processes, it is expected that, as this object clears its primordial
surroundings, it should become optically brighter, show a weakening of its IR
excess and present decreasing line emissions. This behavior is supported by our
observations and analysis, but timescales are expected to be longer than the
one observed here. Based on photometric data secured in 2007, we find Walker 90
at its brightest recorded optical magnitude. We document an evolution in
spectral type over the past five decades (from A2/A3 to currently B7 and as
early as B4), along with a decrease in the near-infrared K fluxes. From
near-infrared images secured in 2004, Walker 90 appears as a point source
placing an upper limit of 0.1 arcsec for its diameter. We conclude that many
observational features are explained if W90 is a flared disk system, surrounded
by an inclined optically thick accretion disk.

growing network models that perfectly match the structure of some real
scale-free networks, such as the Internet. We obtain an analytic solution,
supported by extensive simulations, for the degree distribution in
superlinearly growing networks with arbitrary average degree, and confirm that
in the true thermodynamic limit these networks are indeed degenerate, i.e.,
almost all nodes have low degrees. We then show that superlinear growth has
vast preasymptotic regimes whose depths depend both on the average degree in
the network and on how superlinear the preference kernel is. We demonstrate
that a superlinearly growing network model can reproduce, in its preasymptotic
regime, the structure of a real network, if the model captures some
sufficiently strong structural constraints -- rich-club connectivity, for
example. These findings suggest that real scale-free networks of finite size
may exist in preasymptotic regimes of network evolution processes that lead to
degenerate network formations in the thermodynamic limit.

eccentricity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9, suggesting a different origin. Based on
AO size estimate, we show that (130) Elektra and (283) Emma, G-type and P-type
asteroids respectively, have a significant porosity (30-60% considering CI-CO
meteorites as analogs) and their satellite's eccentricities (e~0.1) are
possibly due to excitation by tidal effects. (379) Huenna and (3749) Balam, two
loosely bound binary systems, are most likely formed by mutual capture. (3749)
Balam's possible high bulk density is similar to (433) Eros, another S-type
asteroid, and should be poorly fractured as well. (379) Huenna seems to display
both characteristics: the moonlet orbits far away from the primary in term of
stability (20% x RHill), but the primary's porosity is significant (30-60%).

Companionship was established on the basis of the common proper motion inferred
from 1998 Two Micron All Sky Survey images and the 2004 IRAC images. In this
paper we present new near-infrared imaging data which confirms the common
proper motion of the system. We also present new 3 - 4 um spectroscopy of HN
Peg B, which provides tighter constraints on both the bolometric luminosity
determination and the comparison to synthetic spectra. New adaptive optics
imaging data are also presented, which shows the T dwarf to be unresolved,
providing limits on the multiplicity of the object. We use the age, distance
and luminosity of the solar-metallicity T dwarf to determine its effective
temperature and gravity, and compare synthetic spectra with these values, and a
range of grain properties and vertical mixing, to the observed 0.8 - 4.0 um
spectra and mid-infrared photometry. We find that models with temperature and
gravity appropriate for the older end of the age range of the system (0.5 Gyr)
can do a reasonable job of fitting the data, but only if the photospheric
condensate cloud deck is thin, and if there is significant vertical mixing in
the atmosphere. Dwarfs such as HN Peg B, with well-determined metallicity,
radius, gravity and temperature will allow development of dynamical atmosphere
models, leading to the solution of the puzzle of the L to T dwarf transition.

important roadblock to the continued down scaling of electronic circuits. There
is a lot of experimental effort at this time to implement switching circuits

switching energy which is dissipated in the switching process of single domain
Ferromagnets used as cascadable logic bits. We obtain generic results that can
be used for comparison with alternative technologies or guide the design of
magnet based switching circuits. Two central results are established. One is
that the switching energy drops significantly if the ramp time of an external
pulse exceeds a critical time. This drop occurs more rapidly than what is
normally expected of adiabatic switching for a capacitor. The other result is
that under the switching scheme that allows for logic operations, the switching
energy can be described by a single equation in both fast and slow limits.
Furthermore, these generic results are used to quantitatively examine the
possible operation frequencies and integration densities of these logic bits
which show that nanomagnets can have scaling laws similar to CMOS technology.

there are two distinct one-parameter families of asymptotic solutions,one is
asymptotic to the proper Friedmann universe, while the other is asymptotic to

compensated. In the asymptotically quasi-Friedmann solution, the density
perturbation falls off only in proportion to the inverse square of the areal

variability in luminosity; 11 (4) are transient candidates. The single
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 6946 and all but one of the eight ULXs
in NGC 4485/90 exhibit long-term flux variability. Two of the ULXs in NGC
4485/90 have not been identified before as ultraluminous sources. The
widespread variability in both systems is indicative of the populations being
dominated by X-ray binaries, and this is supported by the X-ray colors of the
sources. The distribution of colors among the sources indicates a large
fraction of high-mass X-ray binaries in both systems. The shapes of the X-ray
luminosity functions of the galaxies do not change significantly between
observations and can be described by power laws with cumulative slopes ~0.6-0.7

deviation of the supply data of apparel sizes from the sales data of a fashion
discounter. A common approach is to estimate demand for sizes directly from the
sales data. This approach may yield information for the demand for sizes if
aggregated over all branches and products. However, as we will show in a
real-world business case, this direct approach is in general not capable to
provide information about each branch's individual demand for sizes: the supply
per branch is so small that either the number of sales is statistically too
small for a good estimate (early measurement) or there will be too much
unsatisfied demand neglected in the sales data (late measurement). Moreover, in
our real-world data we could not verify any of the demand distribution
assumptions suggested in the literature. Our approach cannot estimate the
demand for sizes directly. It can, however, individually measure for each
branch the scarcest and the amplest sizes, aggregated over all products. This
measurement can iteratively be used to adapt the size distributions in the
pre-pack orders for the future. A real-world blind study shows the potential of
this distribution free heuristic optimization approach: The gross yield
measured in percent of gross value was almost one percentage point higher in
the test-group branches than in the control-group branches.

robust. Using the Top-Dog-Index, we propose a heuristics to improve the
branch-dependent proportion between supply and demand. Our approach cannot

the Malliavin derivative and V is a closed and densely defined operator from H
into another Hilbert space G. Given a bounded operator B on G, coercive on the
closure of the range of V, we consider the realisation of the operator D_V* B
D_V in L^p(E,mu) for 1<p<\infty. Our main result states that the following
assertions are equivalent:
  (1) dom((sqrt(D_V* B D_V)) = dom(D_V) and Meyer's inequalities hold for D_V*
B D_V;
  (2) D_V D_V* B admits a bounded H-infinity calculus on the closure of the
range of D_V;
  (3) dom(sqrt(V*BV)) = dom(V) and Meyer's inequalities hold for V*BV;
  (4) VV*B admits a bounded H-infinity calculus on the closure of the range of
V.
  Moreover, if these conditions are satisfied, then dom(L) = dom(D_V^2) \cap
dom(D_A). The equivalence of (1)-(4) is a non-symmetric generalisation of the
classical Meyer inequalities (which correspond to the case G=H, V=I, B=I). A
one-sided version of the main result, giving L^p-boundedness of the associated
Riesz transforms in terms of a square function estimate, is also obtained.
  As an application let -A generate an analytic C_0-contraction semigroup on a
Hilbert space H and let -L be the L^p-realisation of the generator of its
second quantisation. Our results imply that two-sided bounds for the Riesz
transform of L are equivalent with the Kato square root property for A.

classification performances. Secondly, an alternative kernelization framework
called ""KPCA trick"" is presented. Implementing a learner in the new framework
gains several advantages over the standard framework, e.g. no mathematical
formulas and no reprogramming are required for a kernel implementation, the
framework avoids troublesome problems such as singularity, etc. Thirdly, while
the truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers
related to ours, here, representer theorems are formally proven. The proofs
validate both the kernel trick and the KPCA trick in the context of Mahalanobis
distance learning. Fourthly, unlike previous works which always apply brute
force methods to select a kernel, we investigate two approaches which can be
efficiently adopted to construct an appropriate kernel for a given dataset.

suppressed if the local fluid temperature exceed a critical temperature. PHENIX
data on the centrality dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression in Au+Au collisions

$\chi_c$, $\psi\prime$ and $J/\psi$, in the expanding medium. The critical
temperatures $T_{J/\psi} \approx2.09T_c$ and $T_\chi=T_{\chi_c}=T_{\psi\prime}

Using the non-perturbative renormalization group, we calculate the line of
quantum-phase transitions in the sub-ohmic regime ($s<1$). These quantum-phase
transitions only occur for integer spin $J$. For half-integer $J$, the low
temperature fixed-point is identical to the fixed-point of the spin-boson model
without quantum-tunneling between the two levels. Short-time coherent
oscillations in the spin decay prevail even into the localized phase in the

good correlation of M_VIR propto L_CO^{1.1 +- 0.1} with a Spearman rank
correlation of 0.8 suggesting that the clouds are in nearly virial equilibrium.
Assuming the clouds are in virial equilibrium, we derived an X_CO-factor to be
~ 7 x 10^20 cm^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1. The mass spectrum of the clouds is fitted
well by a power law of N_cloud(>M_CO) proportional to M_CO^{-0.75 +- 0.06}

still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of
the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom
formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain
continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a
singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown
of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a
fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation
of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum
critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a
quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance)
superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally
observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion
Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink
[17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair
which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW)
isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper
pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active
vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the
doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the
experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair)
has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a
Feshbach resonance form of SC.

the functor $-\otimes_A B: \M_A\to \M_A$ is a monad (or triple).
  Similarly, an $A $-bimodule $\C$ is an $A$-coring provided the functor
$-\otimes_A\C:\M_A\to \M_A$ is a comonad (or cotriple). The related categories
of modules (or algebras) of $-\otimes_A B$ and comodules (or coalgebras) of
$-\otimes_A\C$ are well studied in the literature. On the other hand, the right
adjoint endofunctors $\Hom_A(B,-)$ and $\Hom_A(\C,-)$ are a comonad and a
monad, respectively, but the corresponding (co)module categories did not find
much attention so far. The category of $\Hom_A(B,-)$-comodules is isomorphic to
the category of $B$-modules, while the category of $\Hom_A(\C,-)$-modules
(called $\C$-contramodules by Eilenberg and Moore) need not be equivalent to
the category of $\C$-comodules.
  The purpose of this paper is to investigate these categories and their
relationships based on some observations of the categorical background. This
leads to a deeper understanding and characterisations of algebraic structures
such as corings, bialgebras and Hopf algebras. For example, it turns out that
the categories of $\C$-comodules and $\Hom_A(\C,-)$-modules are equivalent
provided $\C$ is a coseparable coring. Furthermore, a bialgebra
  $H$ over a commutative ring $R$ is a Hopf algebra if and only if $\Hom_R(H-)$
is a Hopf bimonad on $\M_R$ and in this case the categories of $H$-Hopf modules
and mixed $\Hom_R(H,-)$-bimodules are both equivalent to $\M_R$.

introduces energy barriers which freeze the system at zero temperature. At
finite temperature we can observe an apparent arrest of coarsening for low

introduced by memory are due to local effects, there exists a timescale on
which coarsening takes place as for the Ising model. Moreover the two point
correlation functions of the Ising model with and without memory are the same,
indicating that they belong to the same universality class.

spatially periodic potential and subjected to a periodically varying field is
explored. Such systems can exhibit a rich diversity of unusual transport
features. In particular, depending on the setting of the initial phase of the
drive, the possibility of a giant transient directed transport in a symmetric,
space-periodic potential when driven with an adiabatically varying field
arises. Here, we study the escape scenario and corresponding mean escape times
of particles from a trapping region with the subsequent generation of a
transient directed flow of an ensemble of particles. It is shown that for
adiabatically slow inclination modulations the unidirectional flow proceeds
over giant distances. The direction of escape and, hence, of the flow is
entirely governed whether the periodic force, modulating the inclination of the
potential, starts out initially positive or negative. In the phase space, this
transient directed flow is associated with a long-lasting motion taking place
within ballistic channels contained in the non-uniform chaotic layer. We
demonstrate that for adiabatic modulations all escaping particles move
ballistically into the same direction, leading to a giant directed current.

near-infrared imaging on several telescopes. We have so far analysed over 350
square degrees and found 770 brown dwarf candidates brighter than z'{AB}=22.5.
We currently have J-band photometry for 220 of these candidates, which confirms
37% as potential L or T dwarfs. Some are among the reddest and farthest brown
dwarfs currently known, including an independent identification of the recently
published ULAS J003402.77-005206.7 and the discovery of a second brown dwarf
later than T8, CFBDS J005910.83-011401.3. Infrared spectra of three T dwarf
candidates confirm their nature, and validate the selection process. The
completed survey will discover ~100 T dwarfs and ~500 L dwarfs or M dwarfs
later than M8, approximately doubling the number of currently known brown
dwarfs. The resulting sample will have a very well-defined selection function,
and will therefore produce a very clean luminosity function.

$q$--Gaussians by construction, and we numerically show that they do so with
asymptotic scale-invariance. Models (iii), like two other strictly
scale-invariant models recently discussed by Hilhorst and Schehr (2007),
approach instead limiting distributions which are {\it not} $q$--Gaussians. The

stars. Most of the emission stars in our survey belong to CBe class ($\sim$
92%) while a few are HBe stars ($\sim$ 6%) and HAe stars ($\sim$1%). The CBe
stars are located all along the MS in the optical CMDs of clusters of all ages,
which indicates that the Be phenomenon is unlikely due to core contraction near
the turn-off. Most of the clusters which contain emission stars are found in
Cygnus, Perseus & Monoceros region of the Galaxy, which are locations of active
star formation. The distribution of CBe stars as a function of spectral type
shows peaks at B1-B2 and B6-B7. Our results indicate there could be two
mechanisms responsible for the CBe phenomenon. Some are born CBe stars (fast
rotators), as indicated by their presence in clusters younger than 10 Myr. Some
stars evolve to CBe stars, as indicates by the enhancement in the fraction of
clusters with CBe stars in the 20-30 Myr age bin.

stochastic sources for the calculation of light quark physics on the lattice.
Meson 2-point correlators measured using sources stochastic in only spin and
those stochastic in both spin and colour indices are compared to point source
correlators on the unit gauge and on a 16^3 x 32 Domain Wall QCD ensemble. It
is found that the use of stochastic sources gives a considerable improvement in
statistics for the same computational cost. The neutral kaon mixing matrix
element B_K is also calculated on this ensemble with stochastic sources, but we
conclude that the stochastic method offers no significant advantage over the
traditional gauge-fixed wall source approach which already offers an exact
volume average. We also discuss the application to semileptonic form factors in
conjunction with partially twisted boundary conditions.

  overview of the relevant experiments)","Source file in latex: 30 pages, with 16 Figures",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This writing has been prepared on the occasion of the 75th birthday of
E.C.George Sudarshan, who (besides the originator of the V-A theory for
weak-forces, of quantum optics --the quantum representation of coherent
light--, of dynamical maps for open quantum systems, of the Zeno effect, etc.)
was a pioneer, already in the sisties, also of the theory of the so-called
""tachyons"".
  This paper wishes to be a homage to E.C.G.Sudarshan, in connection with the
last-mentioned pioneering work of his. After a brief theoretical introduction
(based on the standard postulates of Special Relativity, and therefore
extending it --or rather non-restricting it-- without any violations: for
example, without any violations of the so-called Einstein causality), the main
aim of this article is an updated presentation of the status-of-the-art of the
""superluminal"" experiments. In particular, we devote such a review to the
phenomena met in tunneling through quantum (and classical) barriers [e.g.,
referring to the Genelalized Hartman Effect]; and in connection with the
""Localized (nondiffracting) Solutions"" of the wave equantions [e.g., of Maxwell
equations]: especially of the ""X-shaped"" ones.
  The interested reader is provided with an extended Bibliography.

field equations with $D-2$ commuting Killing vectors in $D>4$ dimensions. The
construction uses Einstein-scalar field seed solutions in 4 dimensions and is
performed both for the case when all the Killing directions are spacelike, as
well as when one of the Killing vectors is timelike. The later case corresponds
to generalizations of stationary axially symmetric solutions to higher
dimensions. Some examples representing generalizations of known higher
dimensional stationary solutions are discussed in terms of their rod structure
and horizon locations and deformations.

introduced. The cumulative distribution of the size of the relaxations is
analytically computed and behaves as a power law with an exponent equal to -1.
This coincides with the phenomenological Gutenberg-Richter behavior observed in
Seismology for the cumulative statistics of earthquakes at the regional or
global scale. The key point of the model is the zero-load state of the system
after the occurrence of any relaxation, no matter what its size. This leads to
an equipartition of probability between all possible load configurations in the
system during the successive loading cycles. Each cycle ends with the
occurrence of the greatest -or characteristic- relaxation in the system. The
duration of the cycles in the model is statistically distributed with a
coefficient of variation ranging from 0.5 to 1. The predictability of the
characteristic relaxations is evaluated by means of error diagrams. This model
illustrates the value of taking into account the refractory periods to obtain a
considerable gain in the quality of the predictions.

four free parameters (determined by the spacelike data with $\chi^2/datum \sim
