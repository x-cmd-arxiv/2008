OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the first
in a high-magnification event. These include photometric and astrometric
measurements from Hubble Space Telescope, as well as constraints from higher
order effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlens
parallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. Our primary
analysis leads to the conclusion that the host of Jovian planet
OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is an M dwarf in the foreground disk with mass M= 0.46 +/-
0.04 Msun, distance D_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_LSR ~
103 km/s. From the best-fit model, the planet has mass M_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 M_Jup,
lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 AU from its host and so has
an equilibrium temperature of T ~ 55 K, i.e., similar to Neptune. A degenerate
model less favored by \Delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of the
impact parameter) gives similar planetary mass M_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 M_Jup with a
smaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 AU, and higher equilibrium
temperature T ~ 71 K. These results from the primary analysis suggest that
OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered that
is hosted by an M dwarf. However, the formation of such high-mass planetary
companions in the outer regions of M-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to be
unlikely within the core-accretion scenario. There are a number of caveats to
this primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) that
the unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, that
is, the planetary host. However, these caveats could mostly be resolved by a
single astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

groups and clusters in a LambdaCDM cosmology are used in order to follow the
building-up of the colour-magnitude relation in two clusters and in 12 groups.
We have found that galaxies, starting from the more massive, move to the Red
Sequence (RS) as they get aged over times and eventually set upon a ``dead
sequence'' (DS) once they have stopped their bulk star formation activity.
Fainter galaxies keep having significant star formation out to very recent
epochs and lie broader around the RS.
  Environment plays a role as galaxies in groups and cluster outskirts hold
star formation activity longer than the central cluster regions. However
galaxies experiencing infall from the outskirts to the central parts keep star
formation on until they settle on to the DS of the core galaxies. Merging
contributes to mass assembly until z~1, after which major events only involve
the brightest cluster galaxies.
  The emerging scenario is that the evolution of the colour-magnitude
properties of galaxies within the hierarchical framework is mainly driven by
star formation activity during dark matter halos assembly. Galaxies
progressively quenching their star formation settle to a very sharp ``red and
dead'' sequence, which turns out to be universal, its slope and scatter being
almost independent of the redshift (since at least z~1.5) and environment.
  Differently from the DS, the operatively defined RS evolves more evidently
with z, the epoch when it changes its slope being closely corresponding to that
at which the passive galaxies population takes over the star forming one: this
goes from z~1 in clusters down to 0.4 in normal groups.

forming stars continuously for the last 6 -- 7 Myr, Berkeley 86 and Biurakan 2
for 5 Myr and Berkeley 87 for the last 2 Myr. This indicates that the Cygnus

turn-off, in the core hydrogen burning phase. These stars are likely to be
Classical Be (CBe) stars. Thus CBe phenomenon can be found in very young MS
stars which are just a few (2 -- 7) Myrs old. This is an indication that CBe
phenomenon need not be an evolutionary effect.

incommensuracy with one of the substrates, pinning to the other sliding
substrate. A quantized sliding state of the same nature is demonstrated here
for a substantially less idealized 2-dimensional model, where atoms are allowed
to move perpendicularly to the sliding direction and interact via Lennard-Jones

stars in the Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey (HES). The selection is based
on the strength of the Ca II K line, B-V colors (both measured directly from
the digital HES spectra), as well as J-K colors from the 2 Micron All Sky
Survey. The KP index for Ca II K can be measured from the HES spectra with an
accuracy of 1.0 Angstrom, and a calibration of the HES B-V colors, using CCD
photometry, yields a 1-sigma uncertainty of 0.07 mag for stars in the color
range 0.3 < B-V < 1.4. These accuracies make it possible to reliably reject
stars with [Fe/H] > -2.0 without sacrificing completeness at the lowest
metallicities. A test of the selection using 1121 stars of the HK survey of
Beers, Preston, and Shectman present on HES plates suggests that the
completeness at [Fe/H] < -3.5 is close to 100% and that, at the same time, the
contamination of the candidate sample with false positives is low: 50% of all
stars with [Fe/H] > -2.5 and 97% of all stars with [Fe/H] > -2.0 are rejected.
The selection was applied to 379 HES fields, covering a nominal area of 8853
square degrees of the southern high Galactic latitude sky. The candidate sample
consists of 20,271 stars in the magnitude range 10 < B < 18. A comparison of
the magnitude distribution with that of the HK survey shows that the magnitude
limit of the HES sample is about 2 mag fainter. Taking the overlap of the sky
areas covered by both surveys into account, it follows that the survey volume
for metal-poor stars has been increased by the HES by about a factor of 10 with
respect to the HK survey. We have already identified several very rare objects
with the HES, including, e.g., the three most heavy-element deficient stars
currently known.

\cite{Vo_Uni} where complete results were obtained for $n =2,3$. The
supersingular locus is uniformized by a formal scheme $\Ncal$ which is a moduli
space of so-called unitary $p$-divisible groups. It depends on the choice of a

closures of the strata (and in particular the reduced irreducible components of
$\Ncal$) are identified with (generalized) Deligne-Lusztig varieties. We show
that the Bruhat-Tits stratification is a refinement of the Ekedahl-Oort
stratification and also relate the Ekedahl-Oort strata to Deligne-Lusztig
varieties. We deduce that the supersingular locus is locally a complete

give formulas for the number of irreducible components of every Ekedahl-Oort

revealed a complicated interplay of a variety of pair-breaking effects and
mechanisms that overcome these pair-breaking effects. In low fields, the linear
temperature dependences of the onset curves in the H-T phase diagrams are
governed by the orbital pair-breaking effect. The dips in the in-plane
field-angle phi dependence of Tc_onset, which were only observed in the
long-tau sample, provides definitive evidence that the field-induced
dimensional crossover enhances the superconductivity if the field direction is
more than about 19-degrees away from the a axis. In the high-field regime for
H//a, the upturn of the onset curve for the long-tau sample indicates a new
superconducting state that overcomes the Pauli pair-breaking effect but is
easily suppressed by impurity scatterings. The Pauli effect is also overcome
for H//b' by a realization of another state for which the maximum of
Tc_onset(phi) occurs in a direction different from the crystalline axes. The
effect on Tc_onset of tilting the applied field out of the conductive plane
suggests that the Pauli effect plays a significant role in determining
Tc_onset. The most plausible explanation of these results is that (TMTSF)2ClO4

Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA, and TPSS meta-GGA and its predecessor, the
nearly nonempirical Perdew-Kurth-Zupan-Blaha (PKZB) meta-GGA, using
self-consistent LSD orbitals and densities. The results show that: (i) For
normal bulk densities, the surface correlation energy is the same in TPSS as in
PBE, as it should be since TPSS strives to represent a self-correlation
correction to PBE; (ii) Normal surface density profiles can be scaled uniformly
to the low-density or strong-interaction limit, and TPSS provides an estimate
for that limit that is consistent with (but probably more accurate than) other
estimates; (iii) For both normal and low densities, TPSS provides the same
description of surface magnetism as PBE, suggesting that these approximations
may be generally equivalent for magnetism. The energies of jellium spheres with
up to 106 electrons are calculated using density functionals and compared to
those obtained with Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo data, including our estimate
for the fixed-node correction. Finally we calculate the linear response of bulk

dissolved in carbon dioxide is considered, using a coarse-grained bead-spring

interactions for the carbon dioxide molecules. In previous work, it has been
shown that this model reproduces the real phase diagram reasonable well, and
also the initial stages of spinodal decomposition in the bulk following a
sudden expansion of the system could be studied. Using the parallelized
simulation package ESPResSo on a multiprocessor supercomputer, phase separation
of thin fluid films confined between parallel walls that are repulsive for both
types of molecules are simulated in a rather large system (1356 x 1356 x 67.8
A^3, corresponding to about 3.2 million atoms). Following the sudden system
expansion, a complicated interplay between phase separation in the directions
perpendicular and parallel to the walls is found: in the early stages the
hexadecane molecules accumulate mostly in the center of the slit pore, but as
the coarsening of the structure in the parallel direction proceeds, the
inhomogeneity in the perpendicular direction gets much reduced. Studying then
the structure factors and correlation functions at fixed distances from the
wall, the densities are essentially not conserved at these distances, and hence
the behavior differs strongly from spinodal decomposition in the bulk. Some of
the characteristic lengths show a nonmonotonic variation with time, and simple
coarsening described by power-law growth is only observed if the domain sizes
are much larger than the film thickness.

to be small, which means that they can be expanded in. Since we are
particularly interested in the implications for CP violation, we fully take
into account complex phases. We demonstrate that one possibility leads to
intrinsically large theta_13 and strong deviations from maximal mixings. The
other possibility is generically close to tri-bimaximal mixing, and allows for
large CP violation. We demonstrate how the determination of the theta_23 octant
and the precision measurement of delta_CP could discriminate among different
qualitative sub-cases. In order to constrain the unphysical and observable
phases even further, we relate our configurations to complex mass matrix

powers of a single complex quantity eta=theta_C exp(i Phi), which can be
motivated by Froggatt-Nielsen-like models. For example, it turns out that in

Near-IR variability surveys of young stellar objects (YSOs) can probe stellar

the on going magnetic and accretion processes. Furthermore, variability can be
used as a tool to uncover new cluster members in star formation regions. We
hope to achieve the deepest near-IR variability study of YSOs targeting the Rho
Ophiuchi cluster. Fourteen epochs of observations were obtained with the Wide
Field Camera (WFCAM) at the UKIRT telescope scheduled in a manner that allowed
the study of variability on timescales of days, months, and years. Statistical
tools, such as the multi-band cross correlation index and the reduced
chi-square, were used to disentangle signals of variability from noise.
Variability characteristics are compared to existing models of YSOs in order to
relate them to physical processes, and then used to select new candidate
members of this star-forming region. Variability in the near-IR is found to be
present in 41% of the known population of Rho Ophiuchi recovered in our sample.
The behaviours shown are several and can be associated with the existence of
spots on the stellar surface, variations in circumstellar extinction, or
changes in the geometry of an accretion disc. Using variability, a new
population of objects has been uncovered that is believed to be part of the Rho
Ophiuchi cluster.

the effects of mergers on compact cool cores in X-ray clusters. We propose a
scheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surface
brightness and entropy profiles. Three dominant morphologies emerge: two
hosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool (CCC systems) or
warm (CWC systems) and one hosting extended cores which are warm (EWC systems).
We find that CCC states are disrupted only after direct collisions between
cluster cores in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage in
off-axis mergers. By the time they relax, our remnant cores have generally been
heated to warm core (CWC or EWC) states but subsequently recover CCC states.
The only case resulting in a long-lived EWC state is a slightly off-axis 3:1
merger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of a
low-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the secondary's core.
Compression prevents core temperatures from falling until after relaxation thus
explaining the observed population of relaxed CWC systems with no need to
invoke AGN feedback. The morphological segregation observed in the L_x-T_x and
beta-r_c scaling relations is reflected in our simulations as well. However,
none of the cases we have studied produce sufficiently high remnant central
entropies to account for the most under-luminous EWC systems observed. Lastly,
systems which initially host central metallicity gradients do not yield merger
remnants with flat metallicity profiles. Taken together, these results suggest
that once formed, compact core systems are remarkably stable against disruption
from mergers. It remains to be demonstrated exactly how the sizable observed
population of extended core systems was formed.

unbounded gradients are eliminated. The case of a linear initial velocity is
particular. We show that if the initial distribution of particles is uniform,
then the mean of the velocity for a given position coincides with the solution

variance of the stochastic perturbation. Further, for a one space space

also diverge. Right at the quantum critical point there is a sharply defined

an interesting {\em universal resistivity jump} in the residual resistivity at

crossovers out of the critical region are also studied. Remarkably the initial
crossover out of criticality on the metallic side is to a Marginal Fermi Liquid

The problem of the moving contact line is treated with the so-called
Generalized Navier Boundary Conditions. Owing to these boundary conditions, it
is possible to circumvent the incompatibility between the classical no-slip
boundary condition and the fact that the contact line of the interface on the
wall is actually moving. The energy stability analysis is based in particular
on an extension of the Geometry Conservation Law (GCL) concept to the case of
moving surfaces. This extension is useful to study the contribution of the
surface tension. The theoretical and computational results presented in this

La(O1-xFx)FeAs. By replacing La with tri-valence rare-earth elements RE of
smaller ionic radii, Tc has subsequently been raised to 41-52 K. Many
theoretical models have been proposed emphasizing the important magnetic origin
of superconductivity in this compound system and a possible further
Tc-enhancement in RE(O1-xFx)FeAs by compression. This later prediction appears
to be supported by the pressure-induced Tc-increase in La(O0.89F0.11)FeAs
observed. Here we show that, in contrast to previous expectations, pressure can
either suppress or enhance Tc, depending on the doping level, suggesting that a
Tc exceeding 50's K may be found only in the yet-to-be discovered compound
systems related to but different from R(O1-xFx)FeAs and that the Tc of
La(O1-xFx)FeAs and Sm(O1-xFx)FeAs may be further raised to 50's K.

is constructed in the formalism of 2T-physics. General Relativity in d
dimensions emerges as a shadow of this theory with one less time and one less
space dimensions. The gravitational constant turns out to be a shadow of a
dilaton field in d+2 dimensions that appears as a constant to observers stuck
in d dimensions. If elementary scalar fields play a role in the fundamental
theory (such as Higgs fields in the Standard Model coupled to gravity), then
their shadows in d dimensions must necessarily be conformal scalars. This has
the physical consequence that the gravitational constant changes at each phase
transition (inflation, grand unification, electro-weak, etc.), implying
interesting new scenarios in cosmological applications. The fundamental action
for pure gravity, which includes the spacetime metric, the dilaton and an
additional auxiliary scalar field all in d+2 dimensions with two times, has a
mix of gauge symmetries to produce appropriate constraints that remove all
ghosts or redundant degrees of freedom. The action produces on-shell classical
field equations of motion in d+2 dimensions, with enough constraints for the
theory to be in agreement with classical General Relativity in d dimensions.
Therefore this action describes the correct classical gravitational physics
directly in d+2 dimensions. Taken together with previous similar work on the
Standard Model of particles and forces, the present paper shows that 2T-physics
is a general consistent framework for a physical theory.

are simply functions of a vector field of variable norm, resembling the
4-vector electromagnetic potential description for the photon fluid, but is
dark (e.g., by very early decoupling from the baryon-radiation fluid). The Dark
Fluid framework naturally branches into a continuous spectrum of theories with
Dark Energy and Dark Matter effects, including the $f(R)$ gravity, TeVeS-like
theories, Einstein-Aether and $\nu\Lambda$ theories as limiting cases. When the
vector field degenerates into a pure Higgs-like scalar field, we obtain the
physics for inflaton and quintessence. In this broad setting we emphasize the
non-constant dynamical field behind the cosmological constant effect, and
highlight plausible corrections beyond the classical MOND predictions. Choices
of parameters can be made to pass BBN, PPN, and causality constraints. The Dark
Fluid is inspired to unify/simplify the astronomically successful ingredients

features in the spectra of all four pulsars can be interpreted only as emission
lines. Moreover, the observed harmonics are not equidistant, and display
certain other properties characteristic of emission by strongly anisotropic

arguments that the electrons giving rise to cyclotron features in the spectra

we proposed a new fundamental equation of nonequilibrium statistical physics in
place of the present Liouville equation. That is the stochastic velocity type's
Langevin equation in 6N dimensional phase space or its equivalent Liouville
diffusion equation. This equation is time-reversed asymmetrical. It shows that
the form of motion of particles in statistical thermodynamic systems has the
drift-diffusion duality, and the law of motion of statistical thermodynamics is
expressed by a superposition of both the law of dynamics and stochastic
velocity and possesses both determinism and probability. Hence it is different
with the law of motion of particles in dynamical systems. Starting from this
fundamental equation the BBGKY diffusion equation hierarchy, the Boltzmann
collision diffusion equation, the hydrodynamic equations such as the mass
drift-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation and the thermal
conductivity equation have been derived and presented here. What is more
important, we first constructed a nonlinear evolution equation of
nonequilibrium entropy density in 6N, 6 and 3 dimensional phase space,
predicted the existence of entropy diffusion. This evolution equation reveals
that the time rate of change of nonequilibrium entropy density originates
together from its drift, diffusion and production in space. Furthermore, we
presented a formula for entropy production rate (i.e. the law of entropy
increase), proved that internal attractive force in nonequilibrium system can
result in entropy decrease while internal repulsive force leads to another
entropy increase, obtained an unified theoretical expression for thermodynamic

minimizing a submodular function, share a rather deep connection via the
polymatroid that is characterized by a submodular set function on the one hand
and represents the performance polytope of the queueing system on the other
hand. We first develop what we call a {\it grouping} algorithm that solves the
queueing scheduling problem under side constraints, with a computational effort
of $O(n^3LP(n))$, $n$ being the number of job classes, and LP(n) being the
computational efforts of solving a linear program with no more than $n$
variables and $n$ constraints. The algorithm organizes the job classes into
groups, and identifies the optimal policy to be a priority rule across the
groups and a randomized rule within each group (to enforce the side
constraints). We then apply the grouping algorithm to the submodular function
minimization, mapping the latter to a queueing scheduling problem with side
constraints. %Each time the algorithm is applied, it identifies a subset; and
We show the minimizing subset can be identified by applying the grouping
algorithm $n$ times. Hence, this results in a algorithm that minimizes a
submodular function with an effort of $O(n^4LP(n))$.

all of the characteristic signatures of the strong p-d interaction of holes and

the peak substitutional Mn concentration meaning that the non-uniform Mn depth

quantitative agreement is found with films grown by low temperature molecular
beam epitaxy (LT-MBE) and having the similar substitutional Mn_Ga composition.
Additionally, we demonstrate that II-PLM Ga1-xMnxAs films are free from
interstitial Mn_I because of the high temperature processing. At high Mn
implantation doses the kinetics of solute redistribution during solidification
alone determine the maximum resulting Mn_Ga concentration. Uniaxial anisotropy
between in-plane [-110]and [110] directions is present in II-PLM Ga1-xMnxAs

due to the variation of the gravitational potential the dark matter halo also
undergoes a compactification. This is well-known as Adiabatic contraction (AC).
Complementary to the AC we investigate the resulting dynamical behaviour of the
whole system if the backreaction of the AC of DM onto the gas is taken into
account. In order to achieve sufficient high resolution also within the central
halo region, we use a crude fluid approximation for the DM obeying the
adiabatic contraction behaviour. Further, we restrict ourself to spherical
symmetry and vanishing angular momentum of the studied matter configurations.
The computations are done using a first-order Godunov type scheme. Our results
show that the dynamical interaction between gas and DM may lead to significant
shorter collapse times. If the gas cools the dynamical behaviour of the whole
system depends strongly on the shape of the initial density profile. Our
findings indicate that for a certain mass range of halo configurations the
dynamical interaction between gas and DM might be important for the halo

with the All Sky Monitor and the Proportional Counter Array on board the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. In the high state, the eclipse ingress and egress are
found to be sharp whereas in the intermediate state the transitions are more
gradual. In the low state, instead of eclipse ingress and egress, the
lightcurve shows a smooth flux variation with orbital phase. The orbital
modulation of the X-ray lightcurve in the low state shows that the X-ray
emission observed in this state is from an extended object. The flux dependent
orbital modulations indicate that the different flux states of Cen X-3 are
primarily due to varying degree of obscuration. Measurement of the pulsed
fraction in different flux states is consistent with the X-ray emission of Cen
X-3 having one highly varying component with a constant pulsed fraction and an
unpulsed component and in the low state, the unpulsed component becomes
dominant. The observed X-ray emission in the low state is likely to be due to
scattering of X-rays from the stellar wind of the companion star. Though we can
not ascertain the origin and nature of the obscuring material that causes the
aperiodic long term flux variation, we point out that a precessing accretion
disk driven by radiative forces is a distinct possibility.

AL: i) weak disorder such that localization results from many quantum

to the formation of a stationary exponentially localized wave function, a

localization length, and compare it to theoretical calculations. Moreover we
show that, in our one-dimensional speckle potentials whose noise spectrum has a
high spatial frequency cut-off, exponential localization occurs only when the

  Using Fluctuations in 21cm Emission","10 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13546.x",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations of damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLA) indicate that the fraction of
hydrogen in its neutral form (HI) is significant by mass at all redshifts. This
gas represents the reservoir of material that is available for star formation
at late times. As a result, observational identification of the systems in
which this neutral hydrogen resides is an important missing ingredient in
models of galaxy formation. Precise identification of DLA host mass via
traditional clustering studies is not practical owing to the small numbers of
known systems being spread across sparsely distributed sight lines. However
following the completion of reionization, 21cm surface brightness fluctuations
will be dominated by neutral hydrogen in DLAs. Observations of these
fluctuations will measure the combined clustering signal from all DLAs within a
large volume. We show that measurement of the spherically averaged
power-spectrum of 21cm intensity fluctuations due to DLAs could be used to
measure the galaxy bias for DLA host galaxies when combined with an independent
measurement of the cosmological HI mass density from quasar absorption studies.
Utilising this technique, the low frequency arrays now under construction could
measure the characteristic DLA host mass with a statistical precision as low as
0.3 dex at z~4. In addition, high signal-to-noise observations of the
peculiar-motion induced anisotropy of the power-spectrum would facilitate
measurement of both the DLA host mass and the cosmic HI density directly from
21cm fluctuations. By exploiting this anisotropy, a second generation of low
frequency arrays with an order of magnitude increase in collecting area could
measure the values of cosmic HI density and DLA host mass, with uncertainties
of a few percent and a few tens of percent respectively.

63um reported by previous observations in four regions, we derived the ionic
abundance Si+/N+ and Fe+/N+ in the ionized gas and Si+/O0 and Fe+/O0 in the
photodissociation gas. For all the targets, we derived the ionic abundance of
Si+/S2+ and Fe2+/S2+ for the ionized gas. Based on photodissociation and HII
region models the gas-phase Si and Fe abundance are suggested to be 3-100% and
<8% of the solar abundance, respectively, for the ionized gas and 16-100% and
2-22% of the solar abundance, respectively, for the photodissociation region

sensitivity of the IRS enables to derive the gas-phase Fe abundance widely in
star-forming regions. The derived gas-phase Si abundance is much larger than
that in cool interstellar clouds and that of Fe. The present study indicates
that 3-100% of Si atoms and <22% of Fe atoms are included in dust grains which
are destroyed easily in HII regions, probably by the UV radiation. We discuss
possible mechanisms to account for the observed trend; mantles which are
photodesorbed by UV photons, organometallic complexes, or small grains.

a selfish rather than utopian strategy is adopted in forming the self-organized

individual roads tend to have a much better correlation with traffic flow than
line-based metrics. These counter-intuitive surprising findings constitute
emergent properties of self-organized natural roads, which are intelligent
enough for predicting traffic flow, thus shedding substantial insights into the

populations satisfy a closed equation of motion that coincides with the
replicator dynamics well-known by its applications in evolutionary game theory.
The feedback generates a new gauge-invariant adiabatic phase, which is free of
the constraints on the Berry phase (e.g., the new phase is non-zero even for
real adiabatic eigenfunctions).

Electronically excited states, assigned to excitons at the Ne/Kr interface, 1i

spin-orbit split atomic Kr 3P1 and 1P1 states, initially appear and shift
towards lower energy when the krypton cluster size m increases. The
characteristic bulk 1t and 1't excitons appear in the spectra, when the cluster
radius exceeds some critical value, R_cl>Delta_1i . Kr clusters comprising up
to 70 atoms do not exhibit bulk absorption bands. We suggest that this is due
to the penetration of the interface excitons into the Kr_m cluster volume,
because of the negative electron affinity of surrounding Ne atoms. From the
energy shift of the interface absorption bands with cluster size an
unexpectedly large penetration depth of delta_1i =7.0+/-0.1 A is estimated,
which can be explained by the interplay between the electron affinities of the
guest and the host cluster.

detector. Using a generic feature of the underlying effective theory that the
unknown 4-dimensional gauge coupling is independent of the number of extra
large dimensions delta, we show that the expected number of events in the
detector is insensitive to the true scale of quantum gravity for delta=2. With

Hence, our bound from the presumed existence of new forces associated with
additional gauge bosons actually conforms with very stringent bounds set from
various astrophysical considerations. Baring any modifications of the infrared
part of the KK spectrum, this bound would therefore rule out the possibility of
observing any signal at the LHC for delta=2. Although a dependence on the

optimum over a family of convex functions. For instance, finding the projection
on the convex functions in $H^k(\Omega)$, and optimizing functionals arising
from some problems in economics.
  In the continuous setting and assuming smoothness, the convexity constraints
may be given locally by asking the Hessian matrix to be positive semidefinite,
but in making discrete approximations two difficulties arise: the continuous
solutions may be not smooth, and functions with positive semidefinite discrete
Hessian need not be convex in a discrete sense.
  Previous work has concentrated on non-local descriptions of convexity, making
the number of constraints to grow super-linearly with the number of nodes even
in dimension 2, and these descriptions are very difficult to extend to higher
dimensions.
  In this paper we propose a finite difference approximation using positive
semidefinite programs and discrete Hessians, and prove convergence under very
general conditions, even when the continuous solution is not smooth, working on
any dimension, and requiring a linear number of constraints in the number of
nodes.
  Using semidefinite programming codes, we show concrete examples of
approximations to problems in two and three dimensions.

space-time history of turbulence is accessible to users remotely through an
interface that is based on the Web-services model. Users may write and execute

The users are thus able to perform numerical experiments by accessing the 27
Terabytes of DNS data using regular platforms such as laptops. The architecture
of the database is explained, as are some of the locally defined functions,
such as differentiation and interpolation. Test calculations are performed to
illustrate the usage of the system and to verify the accuracy of the methods.
The database is then used to analyze a dynamical model for small-scale
intermittency in turbulence. Specifically, the dynamical effects of pressure

evaluated using conditional averages calculated from the DNS data in the

increments and intermittency.

quantified comparing the peak and total flux densities in the final mosaic and
in each of the individual pointings where the source was closest to the center
of the field. We find that the peak flux densities in the original VLA-COSMOS

depending on the distance from the mosaic center. The completeness of the radio
catalog has been tested using samples of simulated radio sources with different
angular size distributions. These simulated sources have been added to the
radio image and recovered using the same techniques used to produce the radio
catalog. The fraction of missed sources as a function of the total flux density
is a direct measure of the incompleteness. Finally, we derived the radio source
counts down to 60 microJy with unprecedented good statistics. Comparison to the
findings of other surveys shows good agreement in the flux density range 0.06-1

the allowed region under theoretical and experimental constraints. It is found
that the possible region for the electroweak vacuum to exist is quite limited,

violation is possible by complex soft SUSY breaking masses. Similar to the CPX

boson mass to become smaller than the $Z$ boson mass while the coupling with
the $Z$ boson is sufficiently suppressed to avoid the LEP experimental
constraints. However, unlike the CPX scenario, large $\mu$ and $A$ are not
required for the realization of large CP violation. The typical spectrum of the
SUSY particles is thus different. We also investigate the possible upper bound
of the lightest Higgs boson in the case of spontaneous CP violation. The
maximal value of it can reach above 100 GeV with maximal CP-violating phases.

motivates the study of the trade-off between the cost of information

  A simple model is presented for studying this information acquisition and

utility function which depends on both the cost and value of information.
Solution techniques are presented for computing near-optimal policies with

exploiting the structure of the optimal policy, and use of Lagrangean

overlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. The X-ray afterglow, observed
from 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay with
alpha_X=1.290 \pm 0.008. Optical observations presented here cover the time
range from 258 s (Faulkes Telescope North) to 15 days (Gemini North) after the
burst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallow
transition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately
13 min after the burst. We suggest the early, steep component is due to a
reverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,
expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times larger
than in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. The ejecta might be
endowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. The optical
light curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, while
there is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the X-ray light curve. We
model the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (the
steeper decay in X-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to X-ray)
are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. This
might imply that the X-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,
such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shock
emission. The possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would give
support to the additional emission scenario.

flow only through the ponderomotive forces. We find that the non-WKB effects
are significant, for the fast and slow solar wind solutions alike. Compared
with their non-WKB counterparts the WKB ones are more effective in accelerating
the solar wind inside the Alfv\'en point, producing significantly enhanced ion
fluxes and considerably reduced alpha abundance in the inner corona. Only when
$\omega \gtrsim 3.5\times 10^{-3}$ ($1.5\times 10^{-3}$) $\rm rad s^{-1}$ can
the fast (slow) wind models be adequately approximated by the WKB one.
Moreover, while the Alfv\'en waves tend to reduce the magnitude of the
proton-alpha speed difference $|U_{\alpha p}|$ in general, different mechanisms
operate in two different regimes separated by an $\omega_c\sim {several}\times
10^{-5}$ $\rm rad s^{-1}$. When $\omega > \omega_c$, the fluctuations are
wave-like and tend to accelerate both ion species, thereby losing most of their
energy by doing work on ion flows; whereas when $\omega < \omega_c$, a
quasi-static behavior results: the fluctuations may act to accelerate the
slower flowing ion species but decelerate the faster moving one in a large
portion of the computational domain, and only a minor fraction of the wave
energy flux injected at the base is lost. The consequences of $\omega_c$ on the
velocity fluctuation spectra of protons and alpha particles, which are likely
to be obtained by future missions like Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe, are

formulas of the antenna's radiation pattern are extracted. In chapter 3 a
computational study - simulation is carried out utilizing the computer program
RICHWIRE which is capable of dividing the antenna in many segments. The study's
results illustrate the variations of the most important antenna's
characteristic quantities as a function of the number of segments. Finally, a
study of the antenna's behavior as a function of the frequency follows at the
range from 900 to 1300 [MHz]. In chapter 4 the antenna's behavior as a function
of frequency is studied at a more extensive range, approximately from 200 to
2850 [MHz]. In chapter 5 an improvement of the antenna's characteristics is
attempted by modifying its geometrical shape utilizing three distinct
geometrical models. Then follow comparative results between the original and
the improved antenna's dispositions and eventually the final conclusions.

FeAs materials may be caused by the Coulomb interaction between d-electrons of
the iron atoms. We find that when the Hund's rule ferromagnetic interaction is
strong enough, the leading pairing instability is in spin-triplet p-wave
channel in the weak coupling limit. The resulting superconducting gap has nodal
lines on the 3D Fermi surfaces. The k dependent hybridization of several
orbitals around a Fermi pocket is the key for the appearance of the
spin-triplet p-wave pairing.

that the derived and residual designs with respect to at least one block are
quasi-symmetric. Quasi-symmetric designs can be used to construct optimal self
complementary codes. In this article we give a construction of an infinite
family of pseudo quasi-3 designs whose residual designs allow us to construct a
family of codes with a new parameter set that meet the Grey Rankin bound.
