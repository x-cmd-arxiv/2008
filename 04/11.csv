of bandwidth and allow to coarsely identify the capacity-optimal bandwidth as a
function of the peak power and the channel's scattering function. We also
obtain a closed-form expression for the first-order Taylor series expansion of
capacity in the limit of large bandwidth, and show that our bounds are tight in
the wideband regime. For input signals that are peak constrained in time only
(and, hence, allowed to be peaky in frequency), we provide upper and lower

lower bound is closely related to a result by Viterbi (1967).

They are expressed in terms of Fermi/Bose distributions and spectral functions,

imaginary parts of the self-energies of different particle species. Therefore
thermodynamically consistent approximate treatment of systems of particles with
finite mass-widths can be performed, provided spectral functions of particle
species are known. Approximation of the free resonance gas at low densities is
studied. Simple ansatz for the energy dependence of the spectral function is
suggested that allows to fulfill thermodynamical consistency conditions. On
examples it is shown that a simple description of dense systems of interacting
particle species can be constructed, provided some species can be treated in
the quasiparticle approximation and others as particles with widths. The
interaction affects quasiparticle contributions, whereas particles with widths
can be treated as free. Example is considered of a hot gas of heavy fermions
strongly interacting with light bosons, both species with zero chemical
potentials. The density of blurred fermions is dramatically increased for high
temperatures compared to the standard Boltzmann value. The system consists of
boson quasiparticles (with effective masses) interacting with fermion --
antifermion blurs. In thermodynamical values interaction terms partially
compensate each other. Thereby, in case of a very strong coupling between
species thermodynamical quantities of the system, like the energy, pressure and

There are well--defined relations between halo and black hole masses and
between the activities of galactic nuclei and halo masses at low redshifts. A
large fraction of black holes forms anti--hierarchically, with a higher ratio
of black hole to halo mass at high than at low redshifts. At $z=1$, we predict
group environments (regions of enhanced local density) to contain the highest
mass and most active (albeit with a large scatter) BHs while the rest of the BH
population to be spread over all densities from groups to filaments and voids.
Density dependencies are more pronounced at high rather than low redshift.
These results are consistent with the idea that gas rich mergers are likely the
main regulator of quasar activity. We find star formation to be a somewhat
stronger and tighter function of local density than BH activity, indicating
some difference in the triggering of the latter versus the former. There exists
a large number of low--mass black holes, growing slowly predominantly through
accretion, which extends all the way into the most underdense regions, i.e. in

orbital period of 1.596 day, and presents a rich emission-line spectrum in
addition to absorption lines from the companion star (B7 V). As the system
inclination is very small (i=0.77 +- 0.09 deg), HD 45166 is an ideal laboratory
for wind-structure studies. The goal of the present paper is to determine the
fundamental stellar and wind parameters of the qWR star. A radiative transfer
model for the wind and photosphere of the qWR star was calculated using the
non-LTE code CMFGEN. The wind asymmetry was also analyzed using a
recently-developed version of CMFGEN to compute the emerging spectrum in
two-dimensional geometry. The temporal-variance spectrum (TVS) was calculated
for studying the line-profile variations. Abundances, stellar and wind
parameters of the qWR star were obtained. The qWR star has an effective
temperature of Teff=50000 +- 2000 K, a luminosity of log(L/Lsun)=3.75 +- 0.08,
and a corresponding photospheric radius of Rphot=1.00 Rsun. The star is
helium-rich (N(H)/N(He) = 2.0), while the CNO abundances are anomalous when
compared either to solar values, to planetary nebulae, or to WR stars. The
mass-loss rate is Mdot = 2.2 . 10^{-7} Msun/yr, and the wind terminal velocity
is vinf=425 km/s. The comparison between the observed line profiles and models
computed under different latitude-dependent wind densities strongly suggests
the presence of an oblate wind density enhancement, with a density contrast of
at least 8:1 from equator to pole. If a high velocity polar wind is present
(~1200 km/s), the minimum density contrast is reduced to 4:1. The wind
parameters determined are unusual when compared to O-type stars or to typical
WR stars. (abridged)

many circumstances the energy-resolved scattering spectra exhibit two clearly
distinct features due to direct scattering and to trapping in the physisorption
well with subsequent desorption. James Clerk Maxwell is credited with being the
first to describe this situation by invoking the simple assumption that when an
impinging gas beam is scattered from a surface it can be divided into a part
that exchanges no energy and specularly reflects and another part that
equilibrates or accommodates completely and then desorbs with an equilibrium
distribution. In this paper a scattering theory is developed, using an
iterative algorithm and classical mechanics for the collision process, that
describes both direct scattering and trapping-desorption of the incident beam.
The initially trapped fraction of particles can be followed as they continue to
make further interactions with the surface until they are all eventually
promoted back into the positive energy continuum and leave the surface region.
Consequently, this theory allows a rigorous test of the Maxwell assumption and
determines the conditions under which it is valid. The theory also gives
quantitative explanations of recent experimental measurements which exhibit
both a direct scattering contribution and a trapping-desorption fraction in the
energy-resolved spectra.

encapsulated in a single non-Poisson shot noise term. We find that while both
models perform equally well in providing adequate correction for a range of
galaxy clustering data in standard LCDM cosmology and in extensions with
massive neutrinos, the Q model can give unphysical results in cosmologies
containing a subdominant free-streaming dark matter whose temperature depends
on the particle mass, e.g., relic thermal axions, unless a suitable prior is
imposed on the correction parameter. This last case also exposes the danger of
analytic marginalisation, a technique sometimes used in the marginalisation of
nuisance parameters. In contrast, the P model suffers no undesirable effects,

of a thermally-supported (Bonnor-Ebert) sphere embedded in a low-density,
high-temperature medium persist for many periods. The predicted column density
variations and molecular spectral line profiles are similar to those observed
in the Bok globule B68 suggesting that the motions in some starless cores may
be oscillating perturbations on a thermally supported equilibrium structure.
Such oscillations can produce molecular line maps which mimic rotation,
collapse or expansion, and thus could make determining the dynamical state from
such observations alone difficult.
  However, while B68 is embedded in a very hot, low-density medium, many
starless cores are not, having interior/exterior density contrasts closer to
unity. In this paper we investigate the oscillation damping rate as a function
of the exterior density. For concreteness we use the same interior model
employed in Broderick et al. (2007), with varying models for the exterior gas.
We also develop a simple analytical formalism, based upon the linear
perturbation analysis of the oscillations, which predicts the contribution to
the damping rates due to the excitation of sound waves in the external medium.
We find that the damping rate of oscillations on globules in dense molecular
environments is always many periods, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of
years, and persisting over the inferred lifetimes of the globules.

one of which is substellar, and 19 new members in Ori OB1b, out of which 7 are
at the substellar limit and 5 are substellar. We looked into the presence of
accretion signatures by measuring the strength of the Ha line in emission.
Accordingly, we classified the new members as having Classical T-Tauri star
(CTTS) or Weak Lined T Tauri star-like (WTTS) nature. We found that all the new
members confirmed in Ori OB1a are WTTSs, while 39 +25/-22 % of the new members

confirmed in OB1a show near-IR color excess while 38 +26/-21 % of OB1b members

low mass young stars in Orion OB1. The similarity in CTTS-like properties and
near-IR excess across the substellar boundary gives support to the idea of a
common formation mechanism for low mass stars and at least the most massive
brown dwarfs. Finally, we remark the discovery of two new members classified as
CTTSs, both exhibiting W(Ha) < -140 A, suggesting significant ongoing
accretion.

adds a Pontryagin term to the Einstein-Hilbert action with a

leads to a theory with torsion, where this tensor is given by an antisymmetric
product of the Riemann tensor and derivatives of the CS coupling. We then
calculate the torsion in the far field of a weakly gravitating source within
the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, and specialize the result to Earth.
We find that CS torsion vanishes only if the coupling vanishes, thus
generically leading to a modification of gyroscopic precession, irrespective of
the coupling choice. Perhaps most interestingly, we couple fermions to CS
modified gravity via the standard Dirac action and find that these further
correct the torsion tensor. Such a correction leads to two new results: (i) a
generic enhancement of CS modified gravity by the Dirac equation and axial
fermion currents; (ii) a new two-fermion interactions, mediated by an axial
current and the CS correction. We conclude with a discussion of the

predictions for $(dE_T/d\eta)/(0.5 N_{part})$ and $(dN_{ch}/d\eta)/(0.5
N_{part})$ for the LHC energy. Furthermore, we have studied the event-by event
fluctuations in $E_T$ and in the ratio of it's components using $\sigma/\mu$ as

of the line width from the optically thin CII* line, constraints from
independent temperature measurements of the LISM gas based on line widths of
other ions, and third, using measured SII column densities as a proxy for CII
column densities. The sample of electron densities appears consistent with a
log-normal distribution and an unweighted mean value of n_e(CII_SII) =
0.11^+0.10_-0.05 cm^-3. Seven individual sight lines probe the Local
Interstellar Cloud (LIC), and all present a similar value for the electron

Cloud, a decelerated cloud at the leading edge of the platoon of LISM clouds,
has a significantly higher electron density than the LIC. Observed toward
G191-B2B, the high electron density may be caused by the lack of shielding from
such a strong radiation source. Given some simple assumptions, the range of
observed electron densities translates into a range of thermal pressures, P/k =
3300^+5500_-1900 K cm^-3. This work greatly expands the number of electron

continuum and line observations show that the clump is isolated over a 4 pc
region and has a radius of ~ 0.5 pc. Our analysis shows that the clump has a
radial density profile propto r ^{-1.2} for r <~ 0.1 pc and has propto r^{-2.3}
for r >~ 0.1 pc which suggests the inner region is infalling, while the infall
wave has not yet reached the outer region. Assuming temperature gradient of
r^{-0.35}, the power law indices become propto r ^{-0.9} for r < ~0.1 pc and
propto r^{-2.0} for r >~ 0.1 pc. Based on a map of the flux ratio of
350micron/450micron, we identify three distinct regions: a bipolar feature that
coincides with the large scale CO bipolar outflow; a cocoon-like region that
encases the bipolar feature and has a warm surface; and a cold layer outside of
the cocoon region. The complex patterns of the flux ratio map indicates that
the clump is no longer uniform in terms of temperature as well as dust
properties. The CO emission near the systemic velocity traces the dense clump
and the outer layer of the clump shows narrow line widths (< ~3 km/s). The
clump has a velocity gradient of ~ 2 km/s pc^{-1}, which we interpret as due to
rotation of the clump, as the equilibrium mass (~ 200 Msun) is comparable to
the LTE mass obtained from the CO line. Over a scale of ~ 1 pc, the clump
rotates in the opposite sense with respect to the >~ 0.03 pc disk associated
with the (proto)star. This is one of four objects in high-mass and low-mass

modulated one when they have opposite sign. For the uniform case, we show that
above a very small Fermi liquid temperature scale (~1 mK), the critical
fluctuations associated with the vanishing hybridization have dynamical
exponent z=3, giving rise to a specific heat coefficient that diverges
logarithmically in temperature, as well as a conduction electron inverse
lifetime that has a T log T behavior. Because the f spinons do not carry
current, but act as an effective bath for the relaxation of the current carried
by the conduction electrons, the latter result also gives rise to a T log T

skin of enhanced [O III]/H-alpha ratio enveloping the inner shell and the
double-S feature, and a triple-shell structure. The spatio-kinematical study
also finds an equatorial component of the main nebula that is kinematically
independent from the bright inner S-shaped arc. We have investigated in detail
the bow shock-like features in IC 4634 and found that their morphological,
kinematical and emission properties are consistent with the interaction of a
collimated outflow with surrounding material. Indeed, the morphology and
kinematics of some of these features can be interpreted using a 3D numerical
simulation of a collimated outflow precessing at a moderate, time-dependent
velocity. Apparently, IC 4634 has experienced several episodes of
point-symmetric ejections oriented at different directions with the outer
S-shaped feature being related to an earlier point-symmetric ejection and the
outermost arc-like string of knots being the relic of an even much earlier
point-symmetric ejection. There is tantalizing evidence that the action of
these collimated outflows has also taken part in the shaping of the innermost

W-R galaxies and a reference sample of galaxies drawn from the DR4. We compare
the function to the results for control samples of non-W-R star-forming
galaxies that are matched closely in redshift, luminosity, concentration,
4000-\AA break strength and specific star formation rate (SSFR). On scales
larger than a few Mpc, W-R galaxies have almost the same clustering amplitude
as the control samples, indicating that W-R galaxies and non-W-R control
galaxies populate dark matter haloes of similar masses. On scales between
0.1--1$h^{-1}$ Mpc, W-R galaxies are less clustered than the control samples,
and the size of the difference depends on the SSFR. Based on both observational
and theoretical considerations, we speculate that this negative bias can be
interpreted by W-R galaxies residing preferentially at the centers of their
dark matter haloes. We examine the distribution of W-R galaxies more closely
using the SDSS galaxy group catalogue of Yang et al., and find that $\sim$82%
of our W-R galaxies are the central galaxies of groups, compared to $\sim$74%
for the corresponding control galaxies. We find that W-R galaxies are hosted,
on average, by dark matter haloes of masses of$10^{12.3}M_\odot$, compared to
$10^{12.1}M_\odot$ for centrally-located W-R galaxies and $10^{12.7}M_\odot$
for satellite ones. We would like to point out that this finding, which
provides a direct observational support to our conjecture, is really very crude
due to the small number of W-R galaxies and the incompleteness of the group
catalogue, and needs more work in future with larger samples.

from m random noisy measurements is of interest in many areas such as system
identification, denoising, pattern recognition, and compressed sensing. This
paper addresses the scaling of the number of measurements m, with signal
dimension n and sparsity-level nonzeros k, for asymptotically-reliable
detection. We show a necessary condition for perfect recovery at any given SNR
for all algorithms, regardless of complexity, is m = Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements. Conversely, it is shown that this scaling of Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements is sufficient for a remarkably simple ``maximum correlation''
estimator. Hence this scaling is optimal and does not require more
sophisticated techniques such as lasso or matching pursuit. The constants for
both the necessary and sufficient conditions are precisely defined in terms of
the minimum-to-average ratio of the nonzero components and the SNR. The
necessary condition improves upon previous results for maximum likelihood
estimation. For lasso, it also provides a necessary condition at any SNR and
for low SNR improves upon previous work. The sufficient condition provides the
first asymptotically-reliable detection guarantee at finite SNR.

the ratio between the cost of the worst possible \textit{Wardrop equilibrium}

significantly increase the price of anarchy. Towards establishing this result,
we first characterize the socially optimal flow and rate allocation in terms of
four intuitive conditions. Next, we show that the Wardrop equilibrium is a
socially optimal solution for a different set of (related) cost functions.

in low-mass galaxies at redshifts greater than 3 with mean formation redshifts
of z = 5.7 (12.7 Gyrs ago) and 4.3 (12.3 Gyrs ago) for metal-poor GCs (MPC) and
metal-rich GCs (MRCs), respectively. About 52 % of galaxies with GCs show clear
bimodality in their metallicity distribution functions, though less luminous
galaxies with M_B fainter than -17 are much less likely to show bimodality
owing to little or no MRCs. The number fraction of MRCs does not depend on
Hubble type but is generally smaller for less luminous galaxies. The specific
frequencies (S_ N) of GCSs are typically higher in ellipticals (S_ N ~ 4.0)
than in spirals (S_ N ~ 1.8), and higher again (S_N ~ 5.0) for galaxies located
at the centers of clusters of galaxies. The total number of GCs per unit halo
mass does not depend strongly on M_B or Hubble type of the host galaxy. The

to values, in the spirit of Bloom Filters. The space requirements of the
dictionary we suggest are much smaller than those of a hashtable. We allow
storing n keys, each mapped to value which is a string of k bits. Our suggested
method requires nk + o(n) bits space to store the dictionary, and O(n) time to
produce the data structure, and allows answering a membership query in O(1)
memory probes. The dictionary size does not depend on the size of the keys.
However, reducing the space requirements of the data structure comes at a
certain cost. Our dictionary has a small probability of a one sided error. When
attempting to obtain the value for a key that is stored in the dictionary we
always get the correct answer. However, when testing for membership of an
element that is not stored in the dictionary, we may get an incorrect answer,
and when requesting the value of such an element we may get a certain random
value. Our method is based on solving equations in GF(2^k) and using several
hash functions. Another significant advantage of our suggested method is that
we do not require using sophisticated hash functions. We only require pairwise
independent hash functions. We also suggest a data structure that requires only
nk bits space, has O(n2) preprocessing time, and has a O(log n) query time.
However, this data structures requires a uniform hash functions. In order
replace a Bloom Filter of n elements with an error proability of 2^{-k}, we
require nk + o(n) memory bits, O(1) query time, O(n) preprocessing time, and
only pairwise independent hash function. Even the most advanced previously
known Bloom Filter would require nk+O(n) space, and a uniform hash functions,
so our method is significantly less space consuming especially when k is small.

analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
The impact of inhomogeneous matter distribution on the CMB observations is in
most cases studied within the linear perturbations of the Friedmann model.
However, since the density contrast and the Weyl curvature within the cosmic
structures are large, this issue is worth studying using another approach. The
Szekeres model is an inhomogeneous, non-symmetrical and exact solution of the
Einstein equations. In this model, light propagation and matter evolution can
be exactly calculated, without such approximations as small amplitude of the
density contrast. This allows to examine in more realistic manner the
contribution of the light propagation effect to the measured CMB temperature
fluctuations.
  The results of such analysis show that small-scale, non-linear
inhomogeneities induce, via Rees-Sciama effect, temperature fluctuations of
amplitude $10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$ on angular scale $\theta< 0.24^{\circ}$ ($\ell >
750$). This is still much smaller than the measured temperature fluctuations on
this angular scale.However, local and uncompensated inhomogeneities can induce
temperature fluctuations of amplitude as large as $10^{-3}$, and thus can be
responsible the low multipoles anomalies observed in the angular CMB power

introduced (C. Monthus and T. Garel, arxiv:0802.2502) a 'strong disorder
renormalization' (RG) procedure in configuration space that can be defined for
any master equation. In the present paper, we analyze in details the properties
of the large time dynamics whenever the RG flow is towards some ""infinite
disorder"" fixed point, where the width of the renormalized barriers
distribution grows indefinitely upon iteration. In particular, we show how the
strong disorder RG rules can be then simplified while keeping their asymptotic
exactness, because the preferred exit channel out of a given renormalized
valley typically dominates asymptotically over the other exit channels. We
explain why the present approach is an explicit construction in favor of the
droplet scaling picture where the dynamics is governed by the logarithmic
growth of the coherence length $l(t) \sim (\ln t)^{1/\psi}$, and where the
statistics of barriers corresponds to a very strong hierarchy of valleys within
valleys. As an example of application, we have followed numerically the RG flow
for the case of a directed polymer in a two-dimensional random medium. The full
RG rules are used to check that the RG flow is towards some infinite disorder
fixed point, whereas the simplified RG rules allow to study bigger sizes and to
estimate the barrier exponent $\psi$ of the fixed point.

  terms of partition hook lengths","35 pages",,,,"math.CO math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discover an explicit expansion formula for the powers $s$ of the Euler
Product (or Dedekind $\eta$-function) in terms of hook lengths of partitions,
where the exponent $s$ is any complex number. Several classical formulas have
been derived for certain integers $s$ by Euler, Jacobi, Klein, Fricke, Atkin,
Winquist, Dyson and Macdonald. In particular, Macdonald obtained expansion
formulas for the integer exponents $s$ for which there exists a semi-simple Lie
algebra of dimension $s$. For the type $A_l^{(a)}$ he has expressed the
$(t^2-1)$-st power of the Euler Product as a sum of weighted integer vectors of
length $t$ for any integer $t$. Kostant has considered the general case for any
positive integer $s$ and obtained further properties.
  -----
  The present paper proposes a new approach. We convert the weighted vectors of
length $t$ used by Macdonald in his identity for type $A_l^{(a)}$ to weighted
partitions with free parameter $t$, so that a new identity on the latter
combinatorial structures can be derived without any restrictions on $t$. The
surprise is that the weighted partitions have a very simple form in terms of
hook lengths of partitions. As applications of our formula, we find some new
identities about hook lengths, including the ""marked hook formula"". We also
improve a result due to Kostant. The proof of the Main Theorem is based on
Macdonald's identity for $A_l^{(a)}$ and on the properties of a bijection
between $t$-cores and integer vectors constructed by Garvan, Kim and Stanton.

(SN) 2003dh, occurred inside a star-forming dwarf galaxy at redshift
$z=0.1685$. The low redshift, and a rich set of archival Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) images, makes this GRB well-suited for a detailed study of the stellar
population in the immediate vicinity of the explosion. Since the lifetime of a
star is directly tied to its mass, the age of the stellar population can be
used to put constraints on the GRB and SN progenitor mass. From the HST images
we extract the colours of the precise site from which the GRB originated, and
find that the colours are significantly different from those of the overall
host galaxy and the surrounding starburst environment. We have used spectral
evolutionary models, including nebular emission, to carefully constrain the age
of the stellar population, and hence the progenitor, at the very explosion
site. For instantaneous burst models we find that a population age of 5 Myr
best matches the data, suggesting a very massive (M > 50 M_sun) star as the
progenitor, with an upper limit of 8 Myr (M > 25 M_sun). For more extended star
formation scenarios, the inferred progenitor age is in most cases still very
young (age < 7 Myr, implying M > 25 M_sun), with an upper limit of 20 Myr (M >
12 M_sun). These age estimates are an order of magnitude lower than the ages
inferred from the overall host galaxy colours, indicating that progenitor mass
estimates based on data for spatially unresolved GRB host galaxies will in
general be of limited use. Our results are consistent with the collapsar
scenario.

resolution in interferometric measurements. In the present paper we analyze the
quantum states obtained by optical parametric amplification of polarization
NOON states. First we study, theoretically and experimentally, the
amplification of a 2-photon state by a collinear Quantum Injected Optical
Parametric Amplifier (QIOPA). We compared the stimulated emission regime with
the spontaneous one, studied by Sciarrino et al. (PRA 77, 012324), finding
comparable visibilities between the two cases but an enhancement of the signal
in the stimulated case. As a second step, we show that the collinear amplifier
cannot be successfully used for amplifying N-photon states with N>2 due to the
intrinsic \lambda/4 oscillation pattern of the crystal. To overcome this
limitation, we propose to adopt a scheme for the amplification of a generic
state based on a non-collinear QIOPA and we show that the state obtained by the
amplification process preserves \lambda/N feature and exhibits a high
resilience to losses. Furthermore, an asymptotic unity visibility can be
obtained when correlation functions with sufficiently high order M are
analyzed.

groups of remarkably aligned molecular clouds at |b|~1--5 degree in the two
regions. In SS433, we have detected 10 clouds in total, which are well aligned
nearly along the axis of the X-ray jet emanating from SS433. These clouds have
similar line-of-sight velocities of 42--56 km s^-1 and the total projected
length of the feature is ~300 pc, three times larger than that of the X-ray
jet, at a distance of 3 kpc. Towards l~348.5 degree, we have detected four
clouds named as MJG348.5 at line-of-sight velocities of -80 -- -95 km s^-1 in
V_LSR, which also show alignment nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane.
The total length of the feature is ~400 pc at a kinematic distance of 6 kpc. In
the both cases, the CO clouds are distributed at high galactic latitudes where
such clouds are very rare. In addition, their alignments and coincidence in
velocity should be even rarer, suggesting that they are physically associated.
We tested a few possibilities to explain these clouds, including protostellar
outflows, supershells, and interactions with energetic jets. Among them, a
favorable scenario is that the interaction between relativistic jet and the
interstellar medium induced the formation of molecular clouds over the last
~10^5-6 yrs. It is suggested that the timescale of the relativistic jet may be
considerably larger, in the order of 10^5-6 yrs, than previously thought in
SS433. The driving engine of the jet is obviously SS433 itself in SS433,

Equivalently, it can be formulated as the problem of finding an upper bound on
M for given radius and charge. This problem has resulted in a number of papers
in recent years but neither a transparent nor a general inequality similar to
the case without charge, i.e., M\leq 4R/9, has been found. In this paper we
derive the surprisingly transparent inequality
$$\sqrt{M}\leq\frac{\sqrt{R}}{3}+\sqrt{\frac{R}{9}+\frac{Q^2}{3R}}.$$ The
inequality is shown to hold for any solution which satisfies $p+2p_T\leq\rho,$

which quantum systems can be manipulated in a controlled and coherent way. One
of the most important goals now is to build quantum simulators, which would
open up the possibility of exciting experiments probing various theories in
regimes that are not achievable under normal lab circumstances. Here we present
a novel approach to gain detailed control on the quantum simulation of strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems by constructing the explicit quantum
circuits that diagonalize their dynamics. We show that the exact quantum
circuits underlying some of the most relevant many-body Hamiltonians only need
a finite amount of local gates. As a particularly simple instance, the full
dynamics of a one-dimensional Quantum Ising model in a transverse field with
four spins is shown to be reproduced using a quantum circuit of only six local
gates. This opens up the possibility of experimentally producing strongly
correlated states, their time evolution at zero time and even thermal
superpositions at zero temperature. Our method also allows to uncover the exact
circuits corresponding to models that exhibit topological order and to
stabilizer states.

  We show that the variances of the distributions of the FP coefficients
derived for the clusters in our sample are not consistent with the hypothesis
of universality of the FP relation. By investigating the origin of such
remarkable variances we find that, besides a couple of obvious factors, such as
the adopted fitting technique and the method used to measure the photometric
and kinematic variables, the coefficients of the FP are strongly influenced by
a number of things, mainly related to the distribution of photometric/kinematic
properties of galaxies in the particular sample under analysis. For instance,
the $a$ coefficient derived for the whole sample of ETGs, turns out to decrease
when faint galaxies are progressively removed from the sample, suggesting that
bright and faint ETGs have systematically different FPs, likely because of
different mechanisms of galaxy formation. In general, by comparing mock cluster
samples with the real one, we conclude that the observed variances of the FP
coefficients cannot be attributed just to statistical uncertainties. We
speculate that the FP is actually a bent surface, which is approximated by
different planes when different selection criteria, either chosen or induced by

than traditional one mainly for mobile ad hoc networks, where route failure
events are frequent. Most studies in the area of multi-path routing focus on
heuristic methods, and the performances of these strategies are commonly
evaluated by numerical simulations. The need of a theoretical analysis
motivates such a paper, which proposes to resort to the terminal-pair routing
reliability as performance metric. This metric allows one to assess the
performance gain due to the availability of route diversity. By resorting to
graph theory, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the tolerance of
multi-path route discovery processes against route failures for mobile ad hoc

improvements achieved by multi-path routing with respect to any traditional

conflict with the cartography of the solar system. In our model, the spaceship
does not suffer any extra acceleration but follows the trajectory predicted by
standard gravitational theory. The observed acceleration is not real but
apparent and has the same observational footprint as a deceleration of
astronomical time with respect to atomic time. The details can be summarized as
follows: i) as we argued in a recent paper, there is an unavoidable coupling
between the background gravitation that pervades the universe and the quantum
vacuum because of the long range and universality of gravity; ii) via the
fourth Heisenberg relation, we show that this coupling causes a progressive
desynchronization of the astronomical and atomic clock-times, in such a way
that the former decelerates adiabatically with respect to the latter; and iii)
since gravitational theory uses astronomical time and the observers use atomic
time (they are using devices based on quantum physics), this desynchronization
necessarily causes a discrepancy between theory and observation, so that the
observed velocity of the spaceship is smaller than the predicted one, in such a
way that the Pioneer seems to lag behind its expected position. The discoverers
of the anomaly suggested ""the possibility that the origin of the anomalous
signal is new physics"" although they added ""the most likely cause of the effect
is an unknown systematics,"" but also that ""In the unlikely event that there is

GMRT observations at 235 MHz, 327 MHz and 610 MHz, and on literature and
archival data at other frequencies. We find that the source major axis is
likely oriented at a small angle with respect to the plane of the sky. The
wide-angle-tail morphology can be reasonably explained by adopting a simple
hydrodynamical model in which both ram pressure (driven by the motion of the
host galaxy) and buoyancy forces contribute to bend the radio structure. The
spectral index progressively steepens along the source major axis from $\alpha
\sim$0.3 in the region close to the radio nucleus to beyond 1.5 in the lobes.
The results of the analysis of the spectral index image allow us to derive an
estimate of the radiative age of the source of $\sim$ 160 Myr. The cluster
X-ray emitting gas has a relaxed morphology and short cooling time, but its
temperature profile is isothermal out to at least 160 kpc from the centre.
Therefore we seek evidence of energy ejection from the central AGN to prevent
catastrophic cooling. We find that the energy injected by 4C +24.36 in the form
of synchrotron luminosity during its lifetime is far less than the energy
required to maintain the high gas temperature in the core. We also find that it
is not possible for the central source to eject the requisite energy in the
intracluster gas in terms of the enthalpy of buoyant bubbles of relativistic
fluid, without creating discernible large cavities in the existing X-ray

sample of ~50 hot, intermediate redshift galaxy clusters, selected from the
XMM-Newton archive, keeping systematic errors under control.
  Methods. Our work is characterized by two major improvements. Firstly, we use
the background modeling, rather than the background subtraction, and the Cash
statistic rather than the chi square; this method requires a careful
characterization of all background components. Secondly, we assess in details
systematic effects. We perform two groups of test: prior to the analysis, we
make use of extensive simulations to quantify the impact of different spectral
components on simulated spectra; after the analysis, we investigate how the
measured temperature profile changes, when choosing different key parameters.
  Results. The mean temperature profile declines beyond 0.2 R_{180}; for the
first time we provide an assessment of the source and the magnitude of
systematic uncertainties. When comparing our profile with that obtained from
hydrodynamic simulations, we find the slopes beyond ~0.2 R_{180} to be similar.
Our mean profile is similar but somewhat flatter with respect to that obtained
by previous observational works, possibly as a consequence of a different level
of characterization of systematic effects.
  Conclusions. This work allows us not only to constrain with confidence
cluster temperature profiles in outer regions, but also, from a more general
point of view, to explore the limits of the current X-ray experiments (in
particular XMM-Newton) with respect to the analysis of low surface brightness

derivative corrections by the method of trace anomaly. Firstly we derive
Hawking radiation for general spherical black holes. We introduce a modified
tortoise coordinate to it and find the analyticity of the coordinate. Secondly
we apply its method to a black hole with a higher derivative correction and
derive the Hawking radiation of it. We found that as an ordinary case the flux
depends only on the surface gravity.

Heritage mosaic made of this galaxy, in four filters (Johnson-Cousins
equivalent B, V, and I broad bands, and an Halpha narrow-band filter), as well
as subsequently acquired U-band images. We find a complex system of ~150 star
clusters in the inner few 100 pc of the galaxy. We do not find any conclusive
evidence of a cluster-formation epoch associated with the most recent starburst
event, believed to have occurred about 4-6 Myr ago. This apparent evidence of
decoupling between cluster and field-star formation is consistent with the view
that star cluster formation requires special conditions. However, we strongly
caution, and provide compelling evidence, that the `standard' simple stellar
population analysis method we have used significantly underestimates the true
uncertainties in the derived ages due to stochasticity in the stellar initial
mass function and the corresponding sampling effects.

stage is realized due to the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with
the plasma electrons and protons in the supernova core. The second stage is
caused by the neutrino resonant spin-flip in a magnetic field of the supernova
envelope. Given the neutrino magnetic moment within the interval $10^{-13}
\mu_{\rm B} < \mu_\nu < 10^{-12} \mu_{\rm B}$, and with the existence of the
magnetic field at the scale $\sim 10^{13}$ G between the neutrinosphere and the

order of $10^{51}$ erg can be injected into this region during the typical time
of the shock-wave stagnation. This energy could be sufficient for stumulation
of the damped shock wave.

correlated with the Catalogue of Principal Galaxies (PGC) to identify new
extragalactic counterparts. 550 reliable optical counterparts have been
detected. We took optical spectra of 176 X-ray candidates and companions at
ESO, Calar Alto observatory and McDonald observatory. We discuss the redshift-,
linewidth-, as well as optical and X-ray luminosity distribution of our ROSAT
selected sample. 139 galaxies of our 166 X-ray counterparts have been
identified as AGN with 93 being Seyfert 1 galaxies (61%). Eighteen of them
(20%) are Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. 34 X-ray candidates (21%) are LINERs
and only eight candidates (5%) are Seyfert 2. The ratio of the number of
Seyfert 1 galaxies to Seyfert 2 galaxies is about 11/1. Optical surveys result
in ratios of 1/1.4. The high fraction of detected Seyfert 1 galaxies is
explained by the sensitivity of the ROSAT to soft X-rays which are heavily
absorbed in type 2 AGN. Two X-ray candidates are HII-galaxies and 25 candidates
(15%) show no signs of spectral activity. The AGN in our RASS selected sample
exhibit slightly higher optical luminosities M_B = (-20.71 +- 1.75) mag and
similar X-ray luminosities (log(L_X [erg/s]) = 42.9 +- 1.7) compared to other
AGN surveys. The Halpha line width distribution (FWHM) of our newly identified
ROSAT AGN sample is similar to the line widths distribution based on SDSS AGN.
However, our newly identified RASS AGN have rather reddish colors explaining
why they have not been detected before in ultraviolet or blue excess surveys.

for star clusters, Ultra Compact dwarfs, galactic nuclei, and local dSph
galaxies, with Subaru contributing substantially to the photometric studies in
particular. These data show that there is a bimodal distribution in half-light
radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than 35pc, while stable
galaxies are always larger than 120pc. We extend the previously known
observational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental
pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored
mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100pc, and
always has a maximum central mass density with a narrow range. The dark matter
in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass
density within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of about
0.1$M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$. None of the dSphs displays kinematics which require
the presence of an inner cusp, while in two dSphs there is evidence that the
density profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions. The maximum central
dark matter density derived is model dependent, but is likely to have a mean
value (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of about 0.1$M_{\odot}$
pc$^{-3}$, which is 5GeV/c$^2$cm$^{-3}$). Galaxies are embedded in dark matter
halos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not
observed.

non-additive measures (or capacities) as the Choquet and the \Sipos{} integral,
and the multilinear model, all seen as extensions of pseudo-Boolean functions,
and used as a means to model interaction between criteria in a multicriteria
decision making problem. The emphasis is put on the use, besides classical
comparative information, of information about difference of attractiveness
between acts, and on the existence, for each point of view, of a ``neutral
level'', allowing to introduce the absolute notion of attractive or repulsive
act. It is shown that in this case, the Sipos integral is a suitable solution,
although not unique. Properties of the Sipos integral as a new way of
aggregating criteria are shown, with emphasis on the interaction among
criteria.
