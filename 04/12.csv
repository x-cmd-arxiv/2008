analytically tractable, use two general approaches. The first approach,
generally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of
disease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission.
The second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information
pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals while
disregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only
alternative that enables the integration of both aspects of disease propagation
simultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has been to abandon the
analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical
framework, which incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure
and the time progression of disease spread. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
this framework is equally effective on finite- and ""infinite""-size networks.
This formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on
networks in other areas of science and technology.

deviate from the relativistic one above a certain energy scale Lambda. We
determine the properties of the leading modifications with respect to the
standard spectra when Lambda is much greater than H, the Hubble scale during
inflation. To be generic, we parameterize the lowest order deviation from the
relativistic law by alpha, the power of P/Lambda where P is the proper
momentum. When working in the asymptotic vacuum, the leading modification
scales as (H/Lambda)^alpha for all alpha, except for a discrete set where the
power is higher. Moreover, this modification is robust against introducing
higher order terms in the dispersion relation. We then algebraically deduce the
modifications of scalar and tensor power spectra in slow roll inflation from
modifications calculated in de Sitter space. The modifications do not exhibit
oscillations unless the dispersion relation induces some non-adiabaticity near
a given scale. Finally, we explore the much less studied regime where H and
Lambda are comparable. Our results indicate that the project of reconstructing
the inflaton potential cannot be pursued without making some hypothesis about
the dispersion relation of the fluctuation modes.

invariance due to the affine parallel transport of local Hamiltonian of the

variability, which has attracted the attention of scientists for more than two
centuries. Until recently, even the existence of solar-climate variability has
been controversial - perhaps because the observations had largely involved
temporary correlations between climate and the sunspot cycle. Over the last few
years, however, diverse reconstructions of past climate change have revealed
clear associations with cosmic ray variations recorded in cosmogenic isotope
archives, providing persuasive evidence for solar or cosmic ray forcing of the
climate. However, despite the increasing evidence of its importance, solar
climate variability is likely to remain controversial until a physical
mechanism is established. Although this remains a mystery, observations suggest
that cloud cover may be influenced by cosmic rays, which are modulated by the
solar wind and, on longer time scales, by the geomagnetic field and by the
galactic environment of Earth. Two different classes of microphysical
mechanisms have been proposed to connect cosmic rays with clouds: firstly, an
influence of cosmic rays on the production of cloud condensation nuclei and,
secondly, an influence of cosmic rays on the global electrical circuit in the
atmosphere and, in turn, on ice nucleation and other cloud microphysical
processes. Considerable progress on understanding ion-aerosol-cloud processes
has been made in recent years, and the results are suggestive of a physically-
plausible link between cosmic rays, clouds and climate. However, a concerted
effort is now required to carry out definitive laboratory measurements of the
fundamental physical and chemical processes involved, and to evaluate their
climatic significance with dedicated field observations and modelling studies.

transformation of the phase of the many-body wave function allows one to
construct a probability generating functional, the Fourier transform of which
with respect to the ""gauge"" field returns the joint probability distribution to
detect any given number of particles at various locations. The method is
applied to the problem of interference of two independent clouds of
Bose-Einstein condensates, where the initially separated clouds with fixed
boson numbers expand and the density profile image of the overlapping clouds is
registered. In the limit of large particle numbers, the probability to observe
a particular image of the density profile is shown to be given by a sum of
partial probability distributions, each of which corresponds to a noisy image
of interference of two matter waves with definite phase difference. In
agreement with earlier theoretical arguments, interference fringes are,
therefore, expected in any single shot measurement, the fringe pattern randomly
varying from run to run. These results conform to the physical picture where
the Bose-Einstein clouds are in spontaneously symmetry broken states, the
hidden phases of which are revealed by the density profile measurement via the
position of the interference fringes.

arising over this time interval. Subsequently, utilizing a bifurcation method
described by Jacques Laskar, two numerical experiments were performed with the
goal of determining dynamically allowed evolutions for the Solar System in
which the planetary orbits become unstable. The experiments yielded one
evolution in which Mercury falls onto the Sun at ~1.261Gyr from now, and
another in which Mercury and Venus collide in ~862Myr. In the latter solution,
as a result of Mercury's unstable behavior, Mars was ejected from the Solar
System at ~822Myr. We have performed a number of numerical tests that confirm
these results, and indicate that they are not numerical artifacts. Using
synthetic secular perturbation theory, we find that Mercury is destabilized via
an entrance into a linear secular resonance with Jupiter in which their
corresponding eigenfrequencies experience extended periods of commensurability.
The effects of general relativity on the dynamical stability are discussed. An
application of the bifurcation method to the outer Solar System (Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) showed no sign of instability during the course of

brightening occurring during quiescence. The observations were obtained early
in 2007, when the object was at about V~17.1, 0.4 mag brighter than the
pre-outburst magnitude. The light curve shows a sinusoidal variability with an
amplitude of about 0.07 mag and a periodicity of 42.48 min, which is half of
the orbital period of the system. In addition, we have observed two
""mini-outbursts"" of the system up to 0.6 mag, with a duration of about 4 days
each. The ""mini-outburst"" had a symmetric profile and repeated in about 32
days. Subsequent monitoring of the system shows a cyclical behaviour of such

formation sites are distributed across its bar. Our aim is to study the
photometric properties of the bar and its HII regions, to elucidate the
conditions under which HII regions form and their spatial relation to the
principal dynamical features of the bar. Methods: We obtained BVRKs and Halpha
photometry of the HII regions of the bar in NGC 1530. Broad-band integrated
colours and Halpha equivalent widths were carefully measured and analysed as a
function of position with respect to the main dust-lanes of the bar. Results:
We measured differences in the Halpha equivalent widths of the HII regions that
are located in the trailing and leading sides of the bar dust-lane. The
possible factors that could produce this difference, such as [NII]
contamination, Lyman-continuum-photon dust-extinction, escape of ionizing
radiation, metallicity, IMF and age, were carefully analysed. Age differences
were confirmed to be the most plausible explanation. This implies that HII
regions that are located further away from the bar dust-lane in its leading
side, downstream from the main bar dust-lane, are older than the rest by
~1.5-2.5 Myr. In addition, a clear spatial correlation has been found between:
location of HII regions, dust spurs on the trailing side of the bar dust-lane,
and the loci of maximum velocity gradients parallel to the bar major axis
(possibly tracing gas flow towards the main bar dust-lane). These results
support the hypothesis that massive stars are forming on the trailing side of
the bar dust-lane, and age as they cross the bar, on a timescale that is
compatible with the bar dynamics timescale.

z~0.9. The system is the largest structure mapped at redshifts approaching
unity, containing at least eight spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters
and groups. Using two 50-ksec ACIS-I pointings we examine both the X-ray point
source population and the diffuse emission from individual clusters in the
system. We find a 2.5\sigma excess of point sources detected in the hard band
(2-10 keV) relative to the number of sources found in blank fields observed by
Chandra. No such excess is observed in the soft band (0.5-2 keV). The hard-band
source density is 1.47 times greater than that of a blank field, in agreement
with the previously reported correlation between overdensity amplitude and
cluster redshift. Using a maximum likelihood technique we have matched 112 of
the 161 detected X-ray point sources to optical counterparts and found 15
sources that are associated with the supercluster. All 15 sources have
rest-frame luminosities consistent with emission from active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We find that the supercluster AGN largely avoid the densest regions of
the system and are instead distributed on the outskirts of massive clusters or
within poorer clusters and groups. We have also detected diffuse emission from
two of the eight clusters and groups in the system, clusters Cl1604+4304 and
Cl1604+4314. The systems have bolometric luminosities of 1.43x10^44 and
8.20x10^43 h70^-2 erg s^-1 and gas temperatures of 3.50 (+1.82-1.08) and 1.64
(+0.65-0.45) keV, respectively. Using updated velocity dispersions, we compare
the properties of these systems to the cluster scaling relations followed by
other X-ray and optically selected galaxy clusters at high redshift.

assume that most of the observed systems will merge within a few hundred Myr

assumptions using virtual galaxy catalogues derived from the Millennium
Simulation, a very large N-body simulation of structure formation in the
concordance LCDM cosmology. These catalogues have been shown to be at least
roughly consistent with a wide range of properties of the observed galaxy
population at both low and high redshift. Here we show that they also predict
close pair abundances at low redshift which agree with those observed. They
thus embed a realistic and realistically evolving galaxy population within the
standard structure formation paradigm, and so are well-suited to calibrate the
relation between close galaxy pairs and mergers. We show that observational
methods, when applied to our mock galaxy surveys, do indeed identify pairs
which are physically close and due to merge. The sample-averaged merging time
depends only weakly on the stellar mass and redshift of the pair. At z<2 this
time-scale is T ~ T0 r25 M*^-0.3, where r25 is the maximum projected separation
of the pair sample in units of 25 kpc/h, M* is the typical stellar mass of the

selected to have line-of-sight velocity difference smaller than 300 km/s and
1.6 Gyr for samples where this velocity difference is effectively
unconstrained. These timescales increase slightly with redshift and are longer

centered at $\nu=0$, while the longitudinal conductance is nonzero in the same
region, reflecting a band of extended states between $\pm E_{c}$, whose
magnitude depends on the disorder strength. The critical exponent corresponding
to the localization length at the edges of this band is found to be $2.47\pm
0.04$. When both bond disorder and a finite mass term exist the localization
length exponent varies continuously between $\sim 1.0$ and $\sim 7/3$.

between some infinite products and integrals. He takes the logarithm of these
infinite products, and expands these using the Euler-Maclaurin summation

  Detecting Absolute Motion","4 figures, editorial adjustments made",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The famous twin paradox of the Special Theory of Relativity by Einstein
(1905) is revisited and revised. This paradox is not a paradox in the true
sense of a paradox but a reflection of a misunderstanding of the problem and
the Principle of Relativity. The currently accepted solution to this takes into
account the accelerations and deceleration of the traveling twin thus
introducing an asymmetry that solves the paradox. We argue here that, with the
acceleration and deceleration neglected, the problem is asymmetric hence
leading to the same conclusion that the traveling twin will age less than the
stay at home. We introduce a symmetric twin paradox whose solution can not be
found within the currently accepted provinces of the STR if one adopts the
currently accepted philosophy of the STR namely that it is impossible for an
inertial observer to determine their state of motion. To resolve this, we
present (in our modest view) a simple and convincing argument that leads us to
conclude that it must be possible for an inertial observer to determine their
own state of motion. With this, we are able to solve the symmetric twin
paradox. The fact that it is possible for an inertial observer to determine
their state of motion -- brings us back to the long rejected idea of an all
pervading and permeating medium -- the Aether, namely the Lorentz luminiferous
Aether. An experiment capable of validating or invalidating this claim is
suggested.

is presented in which the parallel electric field is treated as a large
amplitude, superluminal, electrostatic wave. An exact formalism for such wave
is derived in one-dimension and applied to both the low-density regime in which
the pair plasma density is much lower than the corotating charge density and
the high-density regime in which the pair plasma density is much higher than
the corotating charge density. In the low-density regime, which is relevant
during the phase leading to a pair cascade, a parallel electric field develops
resulting in rapid acceleration of particles. The rapid acceleration leads to
bursts of pair production and the system switches to the oscillatory phase,
corresponding to the high density regime, in which pairs oscillate with net
drift motion in the direction of wave propagation. Oscillating pairs lead to a
current that oscillates with large amplitude about the Goldreich-Julian
current. The drift motion can be highly relativistic if the phase speed of
large amplitude waves is moderately higher than the speed of light. Thus, the
model predicts a relativistic outflow of pairs, a feature that is required for
avoiding overheating of the pulsar polar cap and is also needed for the pulsar
wind.

hole pairs at gas rich galactic nuclei, the dynamical friction experienced by
an object is a combination of its own wake as well as the wakes of its
companions. Using a semi-analytic approach, we investigate the composite wake
due to, and the resulting drag forces on, double perturbers that are placed at
the opposite sides of the orbital center and move on a circular orbit in a
uniform gaseous medium. The circular orbit makes the wake of each perturber
asymmetric, creating an overdense tail at the trailing side. The tail not only
drags the perturber backward but it also exerts a positive torque on the
companion. For equal-mass perturbers, the positive torque created by the
companion wake is, on average, a fraction ~40-50% of the negative torque
created by its own wake, but this fraction may be even larger for perturbers
moving subsonically. This suggests that the orbital decay of a perturber in a
double system, especially in the subsonic regime, can take considerably longer
than in isolation. We provide the fitting formulae for the forces due to the
companion wake and discuss our results in light of recent numerical simulations
for mergers of binary black holes.

from the classical potential, we show that the energy spectra are real and
bounded from below which proves the stability of the spectra of all members in

have a corresponding superpartner class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We were
able to introduce supercharges which in conjunction with the corresponding
super Hamiltonians constitute a closed super algebra. Among the introduced
Hamiltonians, we show that non-$\mathcal{PT }$-symmetric Hamiltonians can be
transformed into their corresponding superpartner Hamiltonians via a specific
canonical transformation while the $\mathcal{PT }$-symmetric ones failed to be
mapped to their corresponding superpartner Hamiltonians via the same canonical
transformation. Since canonical transformations preserve the spectrum, we
conclude that non-$\mathcal{PT }$-symmetric Hamiltonians out of the introduced
class of Hamiltonians have the same spectrum as the corresponding superpartner
Hamiltonians and thus Susy is broken for such Hamiltonians. This kind of
intertwining of $\mathcal{PT }$-symmetry and Supersymmetry is new as all the so

problem. Typically a distribution of nanocrystal sizes and shapes emerges under
the uncontrolled aggregation of smaller clusters. The aim of this computational
study is to investigate the evolution of the nanocrystal electronic states and
their optical properties throughout their aggregation stages. To realistically
tackle such systems, an atomistic electronic structure tool is required that
can accommodate about tens of thousand nanocrystal and embedding lattice atoms
with very irregular shapes. For this purpose, a computationally-efficient
pseudopotential-based electronic structure tool is developed that can handle
realistic nanostructures based on the expansion of the wavefunction of the
aggregate in terms of bulk Bloch bands of the constituent semiconductors. With
this tool, the evolution of the electronic states as well as the
polarization-dependent absorption spectra correlated with the oscillator
strengths over their aggregation stages are traced. The low-lying aggregate
nanocrystal states develop binding and anti-binding counterparts of the
isolated states. Such information may become instrumental with the maturity of
the controlled aggregation of these nanocrystals.

conservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability, based on a
comparison of current primary energy generation methods, it is argued that
future energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy
sectors. A comparison of relative potentials, merits and risks associated with
fossil-fuel, renewable, and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of
technologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation, safe nuclear methods
to produce electricity, while clean-coal plants should be assigned to
transportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and
thorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner)
reactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic
issues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize
spallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or
molten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise
already lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any
successful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative
nuclear, coal, and renewable energy technologies should be pursued.
