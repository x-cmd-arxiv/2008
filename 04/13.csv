tensor gauge fields realize a connection. Our aim here is to introduce
interaction of these non-Abelian tensor gauge fields with fermions and bosons.
We have found that there exist two series of gauge invariant forms describing
this interaction. The linear sum of these forms comprises the general gauge
invariant Lagrangian. Studying the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations we
found that a particular linear combination of these forms exhibits enhanced
symmetry which guarantees the conservation of the corresponding high-rank
currents. A possible mechanism of symmetry breaking and mass generation of
tensor gauge bosons is suggested.

high-k_\perp photons as probes of new physics. We show that this channel is
uniquely suited to search for experimental evidence of TeV-scale open string
theory. At the parton level, we analyze single photon production in gluon
fusion, gg \to \gamma g, with open string states propagating in intermediate
channels. If the photon mixes with the gauge boson of the baryon number, which
is a common feature of D-brane quivers, the amplitude appears already at the
string disk level. It is completely determined by the mixing parameter (which
is actually determined in the minimal theory) -- and it is otherwise
model-(compactification-) independent. We discuss the string signal cross
sections as well as the QCD background. The present analysis takes into account
the recently obtained decay widths of first Regge recurrences, which are
necessary for more precise determination of these cross sections in the
resonant region. A vital part of the background discussion concerns the
minimization of misidentified \pi^0's emerging from high-p_\perp jets. We show
that even for relatively small mixing, 100 fb^-1 of LHC data could probe
deviations from standard model physics associated with TeV-scale strings at a
5\sigma significance, for M_{\rm string} as large as 2.3 TeV. It is also likely
that resonant bumps could be observed with approximately the same
signal-to-noise ratio.

at different accelerator facilities (LEP, B-factories, JLab, HERA, RHIC, and

in the vacuum including theoretical (global fits analyses and MLLA) and
experimental (data from e+e-, p-p, e-p collisions) aspects, (ii) strange and
heavy-quark fragmentation, (iii) parton fragmentation in cold QCD matter

C\in(0,\infty) above the upper-critical dimension 2(\alpha\wedge2). This
answers the open question remained in the previous paper [arXiv:math/0703455].
Moreover, we show that the constant C exhibits crossover at \alpha=2, which is
a result of interactions among occupied paths. The proof is based on a new
method of estimating fractional moments for the spatial variable of the

geometries. In particular, we design ``invasive'' probes crossing the whole
graphene sheet as well as ``external'' probes connected through graphene side
arms. The four-probe conductance measured between external probes varies
linearly with charge density and is symmetric between electron and hole types
of carriers. In contrast measurements with invasive probes give a strong
electron-hole asymmetry and a sub-linear conductance as a function of density.
By comparing various geometries and types of contact metal, we show that these
two observations are due to transport properties of the metal/graphene
interface. The asymmetry originates from the pinning of the charge density
below the metal, which thereby forms a p-n or p-p junction depending on the
polarity of the carriers in the bulk graphene sheet. Our results also explain
part of the sub-linearity observed in conductance as a function of density in a
large number of experiments on graphene, which has generally been attributed to
short-range scattering only.

dependence on field's modes and its role in submillimeter gravity experiments.
In this work we generalize a previous model example: the scalar field vacuum
force between two parallel plates lying in the brane of a Randall-Sundrum
scenario extended by $p$ compact dimensions (RSII-$p$). Upon use of Green's
function technique, for the massless scalar field, the 4D force is obtained
from a zero mode while corrections turn out attractive and depend on the
separation between plates as $l^{-(6+p)}$. For the massive scalar field a
quasilocalized mode yields the 4D force with attractive corrections behaving
like $l^{-(10+p)}$. Corrections are negligible w.r.t. 4D force for
$AdS_{(5+p)}$ radius less than $\sim 10^{-6}$m. Although the $p=0$ case is not
physically viable due to the different behavior in regard to localization for
the massless scalar and electromagnetic fields it yields an useful comparison
between the dimensional regularization and Green's function techniques as we
describe in the discussion.

as more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the

the production of more entropy. Such entropy production will make free energy

theory. It was very popular till one realized that it cannot account for the
masses of the neutrinos. The best cure to this problem is to add the 120 Higgs
representaion, the 'next to minimal' version. To reduce the number of free
parameters, it was suggested in recent papers to use only real parameters in
the superpotential and induce CP violation via complex VEVs. This is what one
usually calls 'spontaneous CP violation'. The number of free parameters turned
out, then, to be even smaller than in the original minimal model and good fits
to all known masses and mixings were obtained. Out of those papers only that of
Aulakh and Garg discusses how CP is spontaneously violated. Some heavy MSSM
singlet VEVs generate a phase at high scale and CP violationis carried down to
the CKM matrix by the mixing of the scalar MSSM doublets. They study the model
in great detail and give a large set of solutions. As a proof of principle, two
of the solutions are shown to induce realistic phenomenological fits. It is not
clear, however, how the right physical solution is obtained. I study the way
solutions for spontaneous CP violation affect the scalar potential. The one
that gives the lowest minimum of the potential, in terms of a given set of
parameters, is the right physical one. In the way of doing so, I will prove
that complex MSSM singlet VEVs lead actually to lower minima than the real (CP
conserving) ones. This proves that CP is spontaneously violated in this model.

requires the presence of an external source of disturbances that get amplified
by an essentially linear mechanism up to the point where breakdown to
turbulence occurs. Microscopic fluctuations are shown here to provide just the
right amount of initial disturbances to match the predictions of linear
stability theory.

Bose-Einstein condensate through a shallow optical lattice of finite width. We
are able to attribute this behavior to the development of a self-trapped state
by using accurate numerical methods and an analytical description in terms of
nonlinear Bloch waves. The dependence of the breakdown on the lattice depth and
the interaction strength is investigated. We show that it is possible to
prohibit the self-trapping by applying a constant offset potential to the
lattice region. Furthermore, we observe the disappearance of the self-trapped
state after a finite time as a result of the revived expansion of the
condensate through the lattice. This revived expansion is due to the finite
width of the lattice.

pulses is investigated. It is shown that when a single pulse propagates through
the scattering medium, the effective optical depth is determined by the
duration of the pulse but not by the scale of the medium. The induced
scattering could hinder propagation of the radio pulse only if close enough to
the source a dense enough plasma is presented. The induced scattering within
the relativistically moving source places lower limits on the Lorentz factor of
the source. The results are applied to the recently discovered short
extragalactic radio pulse.

generated through the leptogenesis route keeping the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry
intact. The $B-L$ global symmetry is then softly broken, providing the sub-eV
neutrino masses. The model then incorporates a MeV scale sterile neutrino like
dark matter.
