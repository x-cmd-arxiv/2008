that focus in one transverse direction and defocus in the other, alternating
between the two directions. Such a guide is suitable for transporting particles
that are attracted to strong electric fields, which cannot be guided using
static fields. Particles are only transmitted if their initial positions and
transverse speeds lie within the guide's phase space acceptance. Nonlinear
forces are always present in the guide and can severely reduce this acceptance.
We consider the effects of the two most important nonlinear forces, a term in
the force that is cubic in the off-axis displacement, and a nonlinear term
which couples together the two transverse motions. We use approximate
analytical techniques, along with numerical methods, to calculate the influence
of these nonlinear forces on the particle trajectories and on the phase space
acceptance. The cubic term alters the focussing and defocussing powers, leading
either to an increase or a decrease of the acceptance depending on its sign. We
find an approximate analytical result for the phase space acceptance including
this cubic term. Using a perturbation method we show how the coupling term
leads to slow changes in the amplitudes of the transverse oscillations. This
term reduces the acceptance when it reduces the focussing power, but has little
influence when it increases that power. It is not possible to eliminate both
nonlinear terms, but one can be made small at the expense of the other. We show
how to choose the guide parameters so that the acceptance is optimized.

including terms in the definition of the stress tensor charges that were
previously overlooked. We show that these terms either vanish identically (for
d > 4) or take a form that does not contribute to the conserved charges (for
d=4). This verifies the earlier claim that boundary stress tensor methods for
asymptotically flat spacetimes yield the same conserved charges as other
approaches. We also derive some additional connections between the boundary

two current loops in the solar chromosphere, by altering the neutral-hydrogen
to proton density ratio, ioniziation/recombination coefficients, collision
frequency and relative helicity of the loops. Methods: 2.5D numerical
simulations of the chromosphere were conducted using a newly developed
two-fluid (ion-neutral) numerical code. Developed from the Artificial Wind
scheme, the numerical code includes the effects of ion-neutral collisions,
ionization/recombination, thermal/resistive diffusivity and
collisional/resistive heating. Results: It was found that the rates of magnetic
reconnection strongly depend on the neutral-hydrogen to proton density ratio;
increasing the density ratio by a thousand-fold decreased the rate of magnetic
reconnection by twenty-fold. This result implies that magnetic reconnection
proceeds significantly faster in the upper chromosphere, where the density of
ions (protons) and neutral-hydrogen is comparable, than in the lower
chromosphere where the density of neutral-hydrogen is over a thousand times the
ion density. The inclusion of ionization/recombination, an important physics
effect in the chromosphere, increases the total reconnected magnetic flux, but
does not alter the rate of magnetic reconnection. Reductions in the ion-neutral
collision frequency, result in small increases to the rates of magnetic
reconnection. The relative helicity of the two current loops was not observed
to have any significant effect on the rates of magnetic reconnection.
Conclusions: The magnetic reconnection rates of coalescing current loops are
strongly affected by the inclusion of neutral-hydrogen particles.

and spectral types near O9.5V and B0.5III. A catalog is presented of 380
diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 A in the
stars' spectrum. The central wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent
widths of nearly all of the bands are tabulated, along with the minimum
uncertainties in the latter. The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines
from the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less severe blends with
DIBs, is made generally easy by the highly variable radial velocities of both
stars. The principal result of this investigation is that the great majority of
the bands in the catalog are very weak and relatively narrow. Typical
equivalent widths amount to a few mA, and the band widths (FWHM) are most often
near 0.55 A. Therefore, most of these DIBs can be detected only in spectra
obtained at a resolving power and a S/N ratio at least comparable to those used
here. In addition, the anomalous interstellar reddening and the very high value
of the ratio N(C2)/E(B-V) seen toward HD 204827 indicate that the physical
conditions in one or more of the several interstellar clouds seen in this

target HD 183143, for example. Probably primarily for these reasons, 113 of the

essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are
undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems.
Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without
transfers is severely limited.
  Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service
quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can
delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require
computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service
degradation is tantamount to requiring that users burn money}, and such
``payments'' can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost
of degrading the social surplus.

processes in idealized porous media related to geological flows, with
applications ranging from groundwater hydrology to enhanced oil recovery. Very
recently, pore network modelling has been applied to model the gas diffusion
layer (GDL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Discrete pore
network models have the potential to elucidate transport phenomena in the GDL
with high computational efficiency, in contrast to continuum or molecular
dynamics modelling that require extensive computational resources. However, the
challenge in studying the GDL with pore network modelling lies in defining the
network parameters that accurately describe the porous media as well as the
conditions of fluid invasion that represent realistic transport processes. In
this work, we discuss the first stage of developing and validating a
GDL-representative pore network model. We begin with a two-dimensional pore
network model with a single mobile phase invading a hydrophobic media, whereby
the slow capillary dominated flow process follows invasion percolation. Pore
network geometries are designed, and transparent hydrophobic microfluidic
networks are fabricated from silicon elastomer PDMS using a soft lithography
technique. These microfluidic networks are designed to have channel size
distributions and wettability properties of typical GDL materials. Comparisons
between the numerical and experimental flow patterns show reasonable agreement.
Furthermore, the fractal dimension and saturation are measured during invasion,
revealing different operating regimes that can be applied to GDL operation.
Future work for model development will also be discussed.

iron-based layered compound $LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ with $T_c$=26 K\cite{yoichi},
and it competes with spin-density-wave (SDW) order\cite{dong}. Neutron
diffraction shows a long-rang SDW-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order at $\sim
134$ K in LaOFeAs\cite{cruz,mcguire}. Therefore, a possible QCP and its role in
this system are of great interests. Here we report the detailed phase diagram
and anomalous transport properties of the new high-Tc superconductors
$SmO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ discovered by us\cite{chenxh}. It is found that
superconductivity emerges at $x\sim$0.07, and optimal doping takes place in the
$x\sim$0.20 sample with highest $T_c \sim $54 K. While $T_c$ increases
monotonically with doping, the SDW order is rapidly suppressed, suggesting a
QCP around $x \sim$0.14. As manifestations, a linear temperature dependence of
the resistivity shows up at high temperatures in the $x<0.14$ regime, but at
low temperatures just above $T_c$ in the $x>0.14$ regime; a drop in carrier
density evidenced by a pronounced rise in Hall coefficient are observed, which
mimic the high-$T_c$ cuprates. The simultaneous occurrence of order, carrier
density change and criticality makes a compelling case for a quantum critical
point in this system.

(LAr TPC) possibly located at shallow depth, coupled to the J-PARC neutrino
beam facility with a realistic 1.66 MW operation of the Main Ring. The new far
detector could be located in the region of Okinoshima islands (baseline $L\sim
658$ km). Our emphasis is based on the measurement of the $\theta_{13}$ and
$\delta_{CP}$ parameters, possibly following indications for a non-vanishing
$\theta_{13}$ in T2K, and relies on the opportunity offered by the LAr TPC to
reconstruct the incoming neutrino energy with high precision compared to other
large detector technologies. We mention other possible baselines like for
example J-PARC-Kamioka (baseline $L\sim 295$ km), or J-PARC-Eastern Korean
coast (baseline $L\sim 1025$ km). Such a detector would also further explore
the existence of proton decays.

flow problem in a game theoretic setting. In this setting, there are selfish
agents, which control some of the requests characteristics, and may be
dishonest about them. It is worth noting that in game theoretic settings many
standard techniques, such as randomized rounding, violate certain monotonicity
properties, which are imperative for truthfulness, and therefore cannot be
employed. In light of this state of affairs, we design a monotone deterministic
algorithm, which is based on a primal-dual machinery, which attains an
approximation ratio of $\frac{e}{e-1}$, up to a disparity of $\epsilon$ away.
This implies an improvement on the current best truthful mechanism, as well as
an improvement on the current best combinatorial algorithm for the problem
under consideration. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that any algorithm in the
family of reasonable iterative path minimizing algorithms, cannot yield a
better approximation ratio. Consequently, it follows that in order to achieve a
monotone PTAS, if exists, one would have to exert different techniques. We also
consider the large capacities \textit{single-minded multi-unit combinatorial
auction problem}. This problem is closely related to the unsplittable flow
problem since one can formulate it as a special case of the integer linear
program of the unsplittable flow problem. Accordingly, we obtain a comparable
performance guarantee by refining the algorithm suggested for the unsplittable
flow problem.

previous observations, with the HERA multi-beam array at the IRAM 30m telescope

molecular gas far away from the cluster centre. To confirm the presence of CO
emission lines in the outer filaments and to study the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line
ratio, we observed seven regions of interest again with the 30m telescope in
both CO(1-0) and CO(2-1). The regions we observed were: the eastern filament,
the horseshoe, the northern filament and a southern extension, all selected
from Halpha emission line mapping. Molecular gas is detected in all the
observed regions. This result confirms the large extent of the cold molecular
gas filaments. We discuss the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratios in the filaments. The
eastern filament has optically thick gas, whereas further away, the line ratio
increases close to values expected for a warmer optically thin medium. We also
show CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines in 9 regions closer to the centre. The
kinematics of the CO is studied here in more detail and confirms that it
follows the motions of the warm H_2 gas found in the near-infrared. Finally, we
searched for dense gas tracers around 3C84 and claim here the first detection
of HCN(3-2).

Wick-rotated black hole spacetimes of Lovelock theory. These are warped
solitonic spaces, where the horizons of the black hole geometries correspond to
the possible positions of codimension-2 branes. The horizon temperature is
related via conical singularities to the tension or vacuum energy of the
branes. We classify the braneworld solutions for certain combinations of bulk
parameters, according to their induced curvature, their vacuum energy and their
effective compactness in the extra dimensions. The bulk Lovelock theory gives
an induced gravity term on the brane, which, we argue, generates
four-dimensional gravity up to some distance scale.

Schwarzschild black hole in six dimensions, are shown to give rise to
self-accelerating braneworlds. We also find that several other solutions have

submersions other than covering maps between compact quotients of complex unit
balls, with a proof that works equally well in a more general equivariant
setting. For a non-equidimensional surjective holomorphic map between compact
ball quotients, our method applies to show that the set of critical values must
be nonempty and of codimension 1. In the equivariant setting the line of
arguments extend to holomorphic mappings of maximal rank into the complex
projective space or the complex Euclidean space, yielding in the latter case a
lower estimate on the dimension of the singular locus of certain holomorphic
maps defined by integrating holomorphic 1-forms. In another direction, we
extend the nonexistence statement on holomorphic submersions to the case of
ball quotients of finite volume, provided that the target complex unit ball is
of dimension m>=2, giving in particular a new proof that a local biholomorphism
between noncompact m-ball quotients of finite volume must be a covering map
whenever m>=2. Finally, combining our results with Hermitian metric rigidity,
we show that any holomorphic submersion from a bounded symmetric domain into a
complex unit ball equivariant with respect to a lattice must factor through a
canonical projection to yield an automorphism of the complex unit ball,
provided that either the lattice is cocompact or the ball is of dimension at
least 2.

controlled-phase gate on a pair of coupled spins which, in its simplest dynamic
form, renders the system subject to fast decoherence rates associated with
exciton creation during the gating operation. In contrast, we show that an
adiabatic approach employing off-resonant laser excitation allows us to
suppress all sources of decoherence simultaneously, significantly increasing
the fidelity of operations at only a relatively small gating time cost. We find
that controlled-phase gates accurate to one part in 10^2 can realistically be
achieved with the adiabatic approach, whereas the conventional dynamic approach
does not appear to support a fidelity suitable for scalable quantum
computation. Our predictions could be demonstrated experimentally in the near

8m:30s after the GRB onset when the magnitude was R ~ 12. This allowed us to
obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolution spectrum of a GRB afterglow
ever (S/N per resolution element ~ 50). The spectrum is rich of absorption
features belonging to the main system at z=0.937, divided in at least six
components spanning a total velocity range of 100 km/s. The VLT/UVES
observations caught the absorbing gas in a highly excited state, producing the
strongest Fe II fine structure lines ever observed in a GRB. A few hours later
the optical depth of these lines was reduced by a factor of 4-20, and the
optical/UV flux by a factor of ~ 60. This proves that the excitation of the
observed fine structure lines is due to ""pumping"" by the GRB UV photons. A
comparison of the observed ratio between the number of photons absorbed by the
excited state and those in the Fe II ground state suggests that the six
absorbers are ~ 2-6 kpc from the GRB site, with component I ~ 3 times closer to
the GRB site than components III to VI. Component I is characterized also by
the lack of Mg I absorption, unlike all other components. This may be due both
to a closer distance and a lower density, suggesting a structured ISM in this
galaxy complex.

about 10 Myr; (ii) a phase of slow dynamical evolution with strong evolutionary
fading of the clusters lasting up to about a Gyr; and (iii) a phase dominated

from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey. These data are combined with photometry
from Aragon-Salamanca et al. (1998) and a low-redshift comparison sample from
von der Linden et al. (2007). The K-band Hubble diagram for BCGs exhibits very
low scatter (~0.35mag) since z=1. The colour and $K$-band luminosity evolution
of the BCGs are in good agreement with passively-evolving stellar populations
formed at z>2. We do not detect any significant change in the stellar mass of
the BCG since z~1. These results do not seem to depend on the velocity
dispersion of the parent cluster. There is a correlation between the 1D
velocity dispersion of the clusters and the K-band luminosity of the BCGs
(after correcting for passive evolution). The clusters with large velocity
dispersions tend to have brighter BCGs, i.e., BCGs with larger stellar masses.
This dependency, although significant, is relatively weak: the stellar mass of
the BCGs changes only by ~70% over a two-order-of-magnitude range in cluster
mass. This dependency doesn't change significantly with redshift. The models of
De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) predict colours which are in reasonable agreement
with the observations because the growth in stellar mass is dominated by the
accretion of old stars. However, the stellar mass in the model BCGs grows by a
factor of 3-4 since z=1, a growth rate which seems to be ruled out by the
observations. The models predict a dependency between the BCG's stellar mass
and the velocity dispersion of the parent cluster in the same sense as the
data, but the dependency is significantly stronger than observed. However, one
major difficulty in this comparison is that we have measured fixed metric
aperture magnitudes while the models compute total luminosities.

showed that for $d \geq 4$, all connected members of ${\cal K}(d)$ are obtained
from stacked $d$-spheres by finitely many elementary handle additions.
According to a result of Walkup, the face vector of any triangulated 4-manifold
$X$ with Euler characteristic $\chi$ satisfies $f_1 \geq 5f_0 - {15/2} \chi$,
with equality only for $X \in {\cal K}(4)$. K\""{u}hnel observed that this
implies $f_0(f_0 - 11) \geq -15\chi$, with equality only for 2-neighborly
members of ${\cal K}(4)$. K\""{u}hnel also asked if there is a triangulated
4-manifold with $f_0 = 15$, $\chi = -4$ (attaining equality in his lower
bound). In this paper, guided by Kalai's theorem, we show that indeed there is
such a triangulation. It triangulates the connected sum of three copies of the
twisted sphere product $S^3 \times {-2.8mm}_{-} S^1$. Because of K\""{u}hnel's
inequality, the given triangulation of this manifold is a vertex-minimal
triangulation. By a recent result of Effenberger, the triangulation constructed
here is tight. Apart from the neighborly 2-manifolds and the infinite family of
$(2d+ 3)$-vertex sphere products $S^{d-1} \times S^1$ (twisted for $d$ odd),
only fourteen tight triangulated manifolds were known so far. The present
construction yields a new member of this sporadic family. We also present a
self-contained proof of Kalai's result.

  and comments are welcome",,,,"math.AG math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much of the homotopical and homological structure of the categories of chain
complexes and topological spaces can be deduced from the existence and
properties of the 'simple' functors Tot : {double chain complexes} -> {chain
complexes} and geometric realization : {sSets} -> {Top}, or similarly, Tot :
{simplicial chain complexes} -> {chain complexes} and | | : {sTop} -> {Top}.
The purpose of this thesis is to abstract this situation, and to this end we
introduce the notion of '(co)simplicial descent category'. It is inspired by
Guillen-Navarros's '(cubical) descent categories'. The key ingredients in a
(co)simplicial descent category D are a class E of morphisms in D, called
equivalences, and a 'simple' functor s : {(co)simplicial objects in D} -> D.
They must satisfy axioms like 'Eilenberg-Zilber', 'exactness' and 'acyclicity'.
This notion covers a wide class of examples, as chain complexes, sSets,
topological spaces, filtered cochain complexes (where E = filtered
quasi-isomorphisms or E = E_2-isomorphisms), commutative differential graded
algebras (with s = Navarro's Thom-Whitney simple), DG-modules over a
DG-category and mixed Hodge complexes, where s = Deligne's simple. From the
simplicial descent structure we obtain homotopical structure on D, as cone and
cylinder objects. We use them to i) explicitly describe the morphisms of
HoD=D[E^{-1}] similarly to the case of calculus of fractions; ii) endow HoD
with a non-additive pre-triangulated structure, that becomes triangulated in
the stable additive case. These results use the properties of a 'total
functor', which associates to any biaugmented bisimplicial object a simplicial
object. It is the simplicial analogue of the total chain complex of a double

We give two upper bounds for the number of $t \in k$ of height at most $B$ such

arithmetic geometry, and shows that there are only finitely many such $t$; but
one has very little control over how this finite number varies as $f$ changes.

decrease relative to the mean level. The Im and Sm galaxies have extensive gas

X-ray afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in cases when the spectrum of the
intrinsic emission is a power-law. We find that the well-known $t^{-(2+\beta)}$
curve is present only when the intrinsic emission is extremely short or the
emission arises from an exponential cooling. The time scale of this curve is
independent of the Lorentz factor. The resulting light curve would contain two
phases when the intrinsic emission has a power-law spectrum and a temporal
power-law profile with infinite duration. The first phase is a rapid decay one
where the light curve well follows the $t^{-(2+\beta)}$ curve. The second is a
shallow decay phase where the power-law index of the light curve is obviously
smaller than that in the first phase. The start of the shallow phase is
strictly constrained by the fireball radius, which in turn, can put a lower
limit to the latter. In the case when the temporal power-law emission lasts a
limited interval of time, there will be a third phase after the
$t^{-(2+\beta)}$ curve and the shallow decay phase, which is much steeper than
the shallow phase. As an example of application, we fit the XRT data of GRB
050219A with our model and show that the curvature effect alone can roughly
account for this burst. Although fitting parameters can not be uniquely
determined due to various choices of fitting, a lower limit of the fireball
radius of this burst can be estimated, which is $\sim 10^{14}cm$.

differences between them? Here we address a distinctly quantum mechanical
setting that displays such differences: disturbances of thermal equilibrium
between two-level systems (TLS) and a bath by frequent and brief quantum

doubly-clamped segment of the superconducting loop of a dc SQUID located
directly opposite the centre conductor of a coplanar waveguide (CPW). The
relative merits of two SQUID based qubit realizations are addressed, in

comparable qubit-mechanical resonator mode as well as qubit-microwave resonator

Two circular areas, 45 arcmin-radius each, centred on the young massive star

are very young (less than 10 Ma), have low extinction, and are neighbours to
sigma Orionis (~3 Ma), a young open cluster very rich in brown dwarfs and
planetary-mass objects. We have used Virtual Observatory tools, the
astro-photometric Tycho-2, DENIS and 2MASS catalogues, 10 control fields at
similar galactic latitudes, and X-ray, mid-infrared and spectroscopic data from
the literature. Results: We have compiled exhaustive lists of known young stars
and new candidate members in the Ori OB1b association, and of fore- and

like early spectral types, lithium in absorption, or mid-infrared flux excess.
Other two young brown dwarf and 289 star candidates have been identified from

movement decisions are made by each sensor on the basis of locally available

  We formally prove that, when a sufficient number of sensors are available,
our approach guarantees a complete and uniform coverage. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the algorithm execution always terminates preventing movement
oscillations.
  Numerous simulations show that our algorithm reaches a complete coverage
within reasonable time with moderate energy consumption, even when the target
area has irregular shapes. Performance comparisons between Push&Pull and one of
the most acknowledged algorithms show how the former one can efficiently reach
a more uniform and complete coverage under a wide range of working scenarios.

resonator coupled capacitively to a Cooper-pair box and assume that the
superconducting qubit is tuned to the degeneracy point so that its coherence
time is maximised and the electro-mechanical coupling can be approximated by a
dispersive Hamiltonian. When the qubit is prepared in a superposition of states
this drives the mechanical resonator progressively into a superposition which
in turn leads to apparent decoherence of the qubit. Applying a suitable control
pulse to the qubit allows its population to be inverted resulting in a reversal
of the resonator dynamics. However, the resonator's interactions with its
environment mean that the dynamics is not completely reversible. We show that
this irreversibility is largely due to the decoherence of the mechanical
resonator and can be inferred from appropriate measurements on the qubit alone.
Using estimates for the parameters involved based on a specific realization of
the system we show that it should be possible to carry out this scheme with
existing device technology.

towards the LMC still remains controversial. Low-mass substellar objects and
stars with masses larger than ~1 M_{sun} have been ruled out as major
components of a MACHO galactic halo, while stars of half solar masses are the
most probable candidates. In this paper we assess jointly the relative
contributions of both red dwarfs and white dwarfs to the mass budget of the
galactic halo. In doing so we use a Monte Carlo simulator which incorporates
up-to-date evolutionary sequences of both red dwarfs and white dwarfs as well
as detailed descriptions of our Galaxy and of the LMC. We explore the complete
mass range between 0.08 and 1 M_{sun} as possible microlensing candidates and
we compare the synthetic populations obtained with our simulator with the
results obtained by the MACHO and EROS experiments. Our results indicate that,
despite that the contribution of the red dwarf population increases by a factor
of 2 the value of the optical depth obtained when taking into account the white
dwarf population alone, it is still insufficient to explain the number of
events claimed by the MACHO team. Finally, we find that the contribution to the
halo dark matter of the whole population under study is smaller than 10% at the
95% conficence level.

We study the asymptotics of surface tension at low temperatures and relate the

that the inequality $\tau^a \leqslant \tau^q$ -- where $\tau^a$ is the surface

This concept is important not only for investigating the structural properties
of the algebras, but, on top of that, the fine gradings are often used as the
starting point for studying graded contractions or deformations of the
algebras. One basic question tackled in the work is the relation between the
terms 'grading' and 'group grading'. Although these terms have originally been
claimed to coincide for simple Lie algebras, it was revealed later that the
proof of this assertion was incorrect. Therefore, the crucial statements about
one-to-one correspondence between fine gradings and MAD-groups had to be
revised and re-formulated for fine group gradings instead. However, there is
still a hypothesis that the terms 'grading' and 'group grading' coincide for
simple complex Lie algebras. We use the MAD-groups as the main tool for finding
fine group gradings of the complex Lie algebras $A_3 \cong D_3$, $B_2 \cong
C_2$, and $D_2$. Besides, we develop also other methods for finding the fine
(group) gradings. They are useful especially for the real forms of the complex
algebras, on which they deliver richer results than the MAD-groups. Systematic
use is made of the faithful representations of the three Lie algebras by
$4\times 4$ matrices: $A_3 = sl(4,\mathbb C)$, $C_2 = sp(4,\mathbb C)$, $D_2 =
o(4,\mathbb C)$. The inclusions $sl(4,\mathbb C)\supset sp(4,\mathbb C)$ and
$sl(4,\mathbb C) \supset o(4,\mathbb C)$ are important in our presentation,
since they allow to employ one of the methods which considerably simplifies the
calculations when finding the fine group gradings of the subalgebras
$sp(4,\mathbb C)$ and $o(4,\mathbb C)$.

bound to the helium surface then dissolve into the continuum turning into
long-lived resonances. As a result microwave absorption lines acquire an
asymmetric Fano lineshape that is tunable by varying the microwave polarisation
or the in-plane magnetic field. Electrons trapped in a formerly bound state
will tunnel off the surface of helium; we show that under suitable
circumstances this ``radioactive decay'' can show damped oscillations rather
than a simple exponential decay. The mechanism for oscillatory exponential
decay is not specific to electrons on Helium and this effect may also be
relevant elsewhere in physics.

  electrolytes",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polymer electrolytes typically exhibit diminished ionic conductivity due to
the presence of correlation effects between the cations and anions.
Microscopically, transient ionic aggregates, e.g. {\it ion-pairs}, {\it
ion-triplets} or higher order ionic clusters, engender ionic correlations.
Employing {\it all-atom} simulation of a model polymer electrolyte comprising
of poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium iodide, the ionic correlations are explored
through construction of elementary functions between pairs of the ionic species
that qualitatively explains the spatio-temporal nature of these correlations.
Furthermore, commencing from the exact Einstein-like equation describing the
collective diffusivity of the ions in terms of the average diffusivity of the
ions (i.e. the self terms) and the correlations from distinct pairs of ions,
several phenomenological parameters are introduced to keep track of the
simplification procedure that finally boils down to the recently proposed
phenomenological model by Stolwijk-Obeidi (SO) [N. A. Stolwijk and S. Obeidi,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 125901, 2004]. The approximation parameters, which can be
retrieved from simulations, point to the necessity of additional information in
order to fully describe the correlation effects apart from merely the fraction
of ion-pairs which apparently accounts for the correlations originating from
only the nearest neighbor structural correlations. These parameters are close
to but not exactly unity as assumed in the SO model. Finally, as an application
of the extended SO model one is able to estimate the dynamics of the free and
non-free ions as well as their fractions from the knowledge of the single
particle diffusivities and the collective diffusivity of the ions.

governing the dielectric properties of relaxor ferroelectrics - a special class
of material that exhibits an enormous electromechanical response and is easily
polarized with an external field. Using neutron inelastic scattering methods,
we show that the PNR can also significantly affect the structural properties of
the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-4.5%PbTiO3 (PZN-4.5%PT). A strong
interaction is found between the PNR and the propagation of sound waves, i.e.
acoustic phonons, the visibility of which can be enhanced with an external
electric field. A comparison between acoustic phonons propagating along
different directions reveals a large asymmetry in the lattice dynamics that is
induced by the PNR. We suggest that a phase instability induced by this
PNR-phonon interaction may contribute to the ultrahigh piezoelectric response
of this and related relaxor ferroelectric materials. Our results also naturally
explain the emergence of the various observed monoclinic phases in these
systems.
