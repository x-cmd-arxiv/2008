description of a composite pseudo-Goldstone Higgs. We first carefully
re-examine the flavor constraints on the mass scale of new physics in the
standard Randall-Sundrum-type scenarios, and find that the KK gluon mass should
generically be heavier than about 21 TeV. We then compare the flavor structure
of the composite Higgs models to those in the RS model. We find new
contributions to flavor violation, which while still are suppressed by the
RS-GIM mechanism, will enhance the amplitudes of flavor violations. In
particular, there is a kinetic mixing term among the SM fields which (although
parametrically not enhanced) will make the flavor bounds even more stringent
than in RS. This together with the fact that in the pseudo-Goldstone scenario
Yukawa couplings are set by a gauge coupling implies the KK gluon mass to be at
least about 33 TeV. For both the RS and the composite Higgs models the flavor
bounds could be stronger or weaker depending on the assumption on the value of
the gluon boundary kinetic term. These strong bounds seem to imply that the
fully anarchic approach to flavor in warped extra dimensions is implausible,
and there have to be at least some partial flavor symmetries appearing that
eliminate part of the sources for flavor violation. We also present complete
expressions for the radiatively generated Higgs potential of various 5D
implementations of the composite Higgs model, and comment on the 1-5 percent
level tuning needed in the top sector to achieve a phenomenologically
acceptable vacuum state.

superconformal field theories corresponding to singular points in the moduli

studying the holomorphic dependence of the path integral measure on the moduli.
We calculate a and c for superconformal points in a variety of gauge theories,
including N=4 SU(N), N=2 pure SU(N) Yang-Mills, and USp(2N) with 1 massless
antisymmetric and 4 massive fundamental hypermultiplets. In the latter case, we
reproduce the conformal and flavor central charges previously calculated using
the gravity duals of these gauge theories. For any SCFT in the class under
consideration, we derive a previously conjectured expression for 2a-c in terms
of the sum of the dimensions of operators parameterizing the Coulomb branch.
Finally, we prove that the ratio a/c is bounded above by 5/4 and below by 1/2.

Contrary to previous reports, there is little evidence of a circumstellar

what is probably a relatively thin sheet of material some 26 pc in front of SN

more robust stability compared to the corresponding prograde MMRs.

Central to the theory and applications of HMM is the Viterbi algorithm to find
{\em a maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate $q_{1:n}=(q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ of
$Y_{1:n}$ given observed data $x_{1:n}$. Maximum {\em a posteriori} paths are

study the behavior of Viterbi alignments when $n\to \infty$. Thus, it has been
shown that in some special cases a well-defined limiting Viterbi alignment
exists. While innovative, these attempts have relied on rather strong
assumptions and involved proofs which are existential. This work proves the
existence of infinite Viterbi alignments in a more constructive manner and for

interacting via a Chern-Simons gauge field, and concentrate on the Hartree-type
contributions. The first-order Hartree approximation is only valid in the limit
of weak coupling \lambda to the gauge field, and results in an antilocalizing
conductivity correction, \sim \lambda^2 g \ln^2 T (g is the conductance). In
the case of strong coupling, an infinite summation of higher-order terms is
necessary, including both the virtual (renormalization) and real (dephasing)
processes. At intermediate temperatures 1/g^2\tau<<T<<1/g\tau (\tau is the
transport time), the T-dependence of the conductivity is determined by the
Hartree correction. At low temperatures T<<1/g^2\tau, the Hartree correction
assumes a logarithmic form with a coefficient of order unity. As a result, the
negative exchange contribution becomes dominant, yielding localization in the
limit of zero T. We further discuss dephasing at strong coupling and show that
the dephasing rates are of the order of T, owing to the interplay of inelastic
scattering and renormalization. On the other hand, the dephasing length is
anomalously short, L_\phi<<L_T. For the case of composite fermions with
long-range Coulomb interaction, the Hartree correction has the usual
T-dependence, and for realistic g is overcompensated by the negative exchange
contribution due to the gauge-boson and scalar parts of the interaction. In
this case, the dephasing length L_\phi is of the order of L_T for not too low T
and exceeds L_T for T<1/g\tau.

for the presence of fracture process zone which we quantify by averaging over
several disordered configurations of the model. The models allow to study the
development of the fracture process zone as the load is increased and to
express this in terms of crack resistance (R-curve).

quasi-static loops at the cores of Active Regions. In order to develop
diagnostics for determining the heating mechanism of these loops from
observations by coronal imaging instruments, I have developed analytical
solutions for the temperature structure and scaling laws of loop strands for a
wide range of heating functions, including footpoint heating, uniform heating,
and heating concentrated at the loop apex. Key results are that the temperature
profile depends only weakly on the heating distribution -- not sufficiently to
be of significant diagnostic value -- and that the scaling laws survive for
this wide range of heating distributions, but with the constant of
proportionality in the RTV scaling law ($P_{0}L \thicksim T_{max}^3$) depending
on the specific heating function. Furthermore, quasi-static analytical
solutions do not exist for an excessive concentration of heating near the loop
footpoints, a result in agreement with recent numerical simulations. It is
demonstrated that a generalization of the solutions to the case of a strand
with a variable diameter leads to only relatively small correction factors in
the scaling laws and temperature profiles for constant diameter loop strands. A
quintet of leading theoretical coronal heating mechanisms is shown to be
captured by the formalism of this paper, and the differences in thermal
structure between them may be verified through observations. Preliminary
results from full numerical simulations demonstrate that, despite the
simplifying assumptions, the analytical solutions from this paper are stable
and accurate.

self-acceleration: the Universe is attracted to the phase of accelerated
expansion at late times even in the absence of the cosmological constant. The
self-acceleration is inevitable in the sense that it cannot be neutralized by
any negative explicit cosmological constant. The model is formulated in the
framework of brane-world theories with a warped extra dimension. The key
ingredient of the model is the brane-bulk energy transfer which is carried by
bulk vector fields with a sigma-model-like boundary condition on the brane. We
explicitly find the 5-dimensional metric corresponding to the late-time de
Sitter expansion on the brane; this metric describes an AdS_5 black hole with
growing mass. The present value of the Hubble parameter implies the scale of
new physics of order 1 TeV, where the proposed model has to be replaced by
putative UV-completion. The mechanism leading to the self-acceleration has
AdS/CFT interpretation as occurring due to specific dynamics of conformal
matter interacting with external ""electric"" fields. The Universe expansion
history predicted by the model is distinguishable from the standard LambdaCDM
cosmology.

order-parameter field between distinct current carrying states. Owing to these
phase slips low-dimensional superconductors acquire electrical resistance. In
quasi-one-dimensional nanowires it is well known that at higher temperatures
phase slips occur via the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the
order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that
phase slips should proceed via quantum tunnelling events, which are known as
quantum phase slips (QPS). Here we report strong evidence for individual
quantum tunnelling events undergone by the superconducting order-parameter
field in homogeneous nanowires.We accomplish this via measurements of the
distribution of switching currents-the high-bias currents at which
superconductivity gives way to resistive behaviour-whose width exhibits a
rather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. We
outline a stochastic model of phase slip kinetics which relates the basic phase
slip rates to switching rates. Comparison with this model indicates that the
phase predominantly slips via thermal activation at high temperatures but at
sufficiently low temperatures switching is caused by individual topological
tunnelling events of the order-parameter field, i.e., QPS. Importantly,
measurements on several wires show that quantum fluctuations tend to dominate
over thermal fluctuations at larger temperatures in wires having larger
critical currents. This fact provides strong supports the view that the
anomalously high switching rates observed at low temperatures are indeed due to
QPS, and not consequences of extraneous noise or hidden inhomogeneity of the
wire.

on the potential of future ground-based gamma-ray experiments to observe the
highest energy emission ever recorded for GRBs, particularly for those that are
nearby and have high Lorentz factors in the GRB jet. It is clear that the
detection of VHE emission would have strong implications for GRB models, as
well as cosmic ray origin. In particular, the extended emission phase
(including both afterglow emission and possible flaring) of nearby long GRBs
could provide the best possibility for detection. The difficult-to-obtain
observations during the prompt phase of nearby long GRBs and short GRBs could
also provide particularly strong constraints on the opacity and bulk Lorentz
factors surrounding the acceleration site. The synergy with upcoming and

function of redshift and compute zero-lag cross-correlations to compare with
the quasar pair data. The simulations agree with the data with the same

times less than that of the initial prompt emission, but in some cases the
flare is as energetic as the prompt emission itself. The flares display fast
rises and decays, and they sometimes occur at very late times relative to the
prompt emission (sometimes as late as 10^5 s after T_0) with very high peak
fluxes relative to the underlying afterglow decay that has clearly begun prior
to some flares. The temporal and spectral properties of the flares are found to
favor models in which flares arise due to the same GRB internal engine
processes that spawned the prompt GRB emission. Therefore, both long and short
GRB internal engine models must be capable of producing high fluences in the

essential to eliminate systematic effects upon its signal, one of the most
significant ones being correlations between the gravitational shear and the
intrinsic ellipticity of source galaxies. Because of the crudeness of current
models of intrinsic alignment, we have developed a model-independent, purely
geometrical method to remove shear-ellipticity correlations. We eliminate the
contributions to a tomographic cosmic shear signal that may be subject to
contamination by shear-ellipticity correlations, making use of the
characteristic dependence of these correlations on redshift. By introducing an
appropriately chosen weight function to the lensing efficiency that nulls
signals stemming from certain distances, new second-order measures of cosmic
shear, free of intrinsic alignment, can be constructed. The loss of information
induced by this nulling technique and the subsequent degradation of constraints
on cosmological parameters is quantified in a likelihood analysis. Concerning
the construction of optimal weight functions, good agreement is achieved
between all approaches considered. For a survey divided into 20 redshift bins
we find that the area of credible regions increases by 20% up to about 50%
after the application of nulling, depending on the cosmological parameters
considered. We demonstrate that due to an optimization of the weight functions
nearly all information is contained in a small subset of the new second-order
measures. The use of a significantly smaller number of redshift bins than 20
for the nulling considerably degrades parameter constraints under conservative
assumptions, emphasizing the need for detailed redshift information.

increases with increasing halo mass. We do not observe any evolution of the
relationship between red galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass, although we
expect both galaxy stellar masses and halo masses to evolve over cosmic time.
We find that the stellar mass contained within the red population has doubled
since z=1, with the stellar mass within red satellite galaxies tripling over
this redshift range. In cluster mass halos most of the stellar mass resides
within satellite galaxies and the intra-cluster light, with a minority of the
stellar mass residing within central galaxies. The stellar masses of the most
luminous red central galaxies are proportional to halo mass to the power of a
third. We thus conclude that halo mergers do not always lead to rapid growth of
central galaxies. While very massive halos often double in mass over the past 7
Gyr, the stellar masses of their central galaxies typically grow by only 30%.

main-sequence (MS) companion may account for some observed long-orbital period
blue stragglers. However, little attention {\bf is paid to this blue straggler
formation scenario} as dynamical instability often happens when the mass donor
is a giant star. In this paper, we have studied the critical mass ratio,
$q_{\rm c}$, for dynamically stable mass transfer from a giant star to a MS
companion using detailed evolution calculations. The results show that a more
evolved star is generally less stable for Roche lobe overflow. Meanwhile,
$q_{\rm c}$ almost linearly increases with the amount of the mass and angular
momentum {\bf lost} during mass transfer, but has little dependance on stellar
wind. To conveniently use the result, we give a fit of $q_{\rm c}$ as a
function of the stellar radius at the onset of Roche lobe overflow and of the
mass transfer efficiency during the Roche lobe overflow.
  To examine the formation of blue stragglers from mass transfer between giants
and MS stars, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations with various $q_{\rm
c}$. {\bf The simulations show that some binaries with the mass donor on the
first giant branch may contribute to blue stragglers with $q_{\rm c}$ obtained
in this paper but will not from previous $q_{\rm c}$. Meanwhile, from our
$q_{\rm c}$, blue stragglers from the mass transfer between an AGB star and a
MS companion may be more numerous and have a wider range of orbital periods
than those from the other $q_{\rm c}$.

super-Earths: planet-planet scattering and migration. We model scenarios where
these planets originate near the snow line in ``cold finger'' circumstellar
disks. Low-mass planet-planet scattering excites planets to low periastron
orbits only for lower mass stars. With long circularisation times, these
planets reside on long-period eccentric orbits. Closer formation regions mean
planets that reach short-period orbits by migration are most common around
low-mass stars. Above ~1 Solar mass, planets massive enough to migrate to
close-in orbits before the gas disk dissipates are above the critical mass for
gas giant formation. Thus, there is an upper stellar mass limit for
short-period super-Earths that form by migration. If disk masses are
distributed as a power law, planet frequency increases with metallicity because
most disks have low masses. For disk masses distributed around a relatively
high mass, planet frequency decreases with increasing metallicity. As icy
planets migrate, they shepherd interior objects toward the star, which grow to
~1 Earth mass. In contrast to icy migrators, surviving shepherded planets are
rocky. Upon reaching short-period orbits, planets are subject to evaporation
processes. The closest planets may be reduced to rocky or icy cores. Low-mass
stars have lower EUV luminosities, so the level of evaporation decreases with
decreasing stellar mass.

merging of stars. The evolution of multi-mass, dense star clusters was followed
by means of direct N-body simulations of up to 131.072 stars. All clusters
started from King models with dimensionless central potentials of 3.0 <= W_0 <=
9.0. Initial mass segregation was realized by varying the minimum mass of a
certain fraction of stars whose either (1) distances were closest to the
cluster center or (2) total energies were lowest. The second case is more
favorable to promote the runaway merging of stars by creating a high-mass core
of massive, low-energy stars. Initial mass segregation could decrease the
central relaxation time and thus help the formation of a high-mass core.
However, we found that initial mass segregation does not help the runaway
stellar merger to happen if the overall mass density profile is kept constant.
This is due to the fact that the collision rate of stars is not increased due
to initial mass segregation. Our simulations show that initial mass segregation
is not sufficient to allow runaway merging of stars to occur in clusters with
central densities typical for star clusters in the Milky Way.

requiring that the quantum game attains a classical interpretation for

indeed escape from the classical outcome of the game, because of
non-factorizable joint probabilities that the EPR setting can provide. This

Bloch equation approach. The spin relaxation time first increases and then
decreases with electric field, especially when the temperature is relatively
low. We show that $L$ valleys play the role of a ``drain'' of the total spin
polarization due to the large spin-orbit coupling in $L$ valleys and the strong
$\Gamma$-$L$ inter-valley scattering, and thus can enhance spin relaxation of
the total system effectively when the in-plane electric field is high. Under
electric field, spin precession resulting from the electric-field-induced
magnetic field is observed. Meanwhile, due to the strong $\Gamma$-$L$
inter-valley scattering as well as the strong inhomogeneous broadening in $L$
valleys, electron spins in $L$ valleys possess almost the same damping rate and
precession frequency as those in $\Gamma$ valley. This feature still holds when
a finite static magnetic field is applied in Voigt configuration, despite that
the $g$-factor of $L$ valleys is much larger than that of $\Gamma$ valley.
Moreover, it is shown that the property of spin precession of the whole system
is dominated by electrons in $\Gamma$ valley. Temperature, magnetic field, and
impurity can affect spin relaxation in low electric field regime. However, they
are shown to have marginal influence in high electric field regime.

single giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) is described, which complements the
existing methods utilizing either a planar black lipid membrane or
sub-micrometre-sized liposomes. A single GUV is transferred using a
micropipette from a solution of a nonpermeable solute into an iso-osmolar
solution of a solute with a higher membrane permeability. Osmotical swelling of
the vesicle is monitored with a CCD camera mounted on a phase contrast
microscope, and a sequence of images is obtained. On each image, the points on
the vesicle contour are determined using Sobel filtering with adaptive
binarization threshold, and from these, the vesicle radius is calculated with a
great accuracy. From the time-dependence of the vesicle radius, the membrane
permeability is obtained. Using a test set of data, the method provided a
consistent estimate of the POPC membrane permeability for glycerol, P = 1.7 x
10^-8 m/s, with individual samples ranging from 1.61 x 10^-8 m/s to 1.98 x
10^-8 m/s. This value is ~40% lower than the one obtained on similar systems.

assumption that the alpha-effect is insignificant in the leading order (e.g.,
due to a symmetry of the system). The mean-field equations generalise the
standard equations of hydromagnetic convection: New terms emerge -- a
second-order linear operator representing the combined eddy diffusivity, and
quadratic terms associated with the eddy advection. If the perturbed CHM regime
is non-steady and insignificance of the alpha-effect in the system does not
rely on the presence of a spatial symmetry, the combined eddy diffusivity
operator also involves a non-local pseudodifferential operator. If the
perturbed CHM state is almost symmetric, alpha-effect terms appear in the
mean-field equations as well. Near a point of a symmetry-breaking bifurcation,
cubic nonlinearity emerges in the equations. All the new terms are in general
anisotropic. A method for evaluation of their coefficients is presented; it
requires solution of a significantly smaller number of auxiliary problems than

on the physical meaning of cosmological constant. It is primarily based on a
conceptual analogy with energy characteristics of the crystal lattice
structure, i.e. energy zones theory in solid state physics. Namely, according
to some theories (holographic principle, emergent gravity etc.) it is supposed
that empty space, i.e. quantum vacuum holds a structure like to crystal
lattice. It implies a possibility of the existence of totally occupied zones
consisting of many levels of the negative energies as well as at least one
negative energy forbidden zone, i.e. negative energy gap without any (occupied
or empty) level of the negative energy. We suppose that given negative energy
forbidden zone in the quantum vacuum represents effectively a positive energy
zone without quantum particles that corresponds to cosmological constant. Also
we suggest some other (less extravagant) model of the cosmological constant.
Here cosmological constant is usually considered as the effect of the quantum
vacuum fluctuations where problem of the cut-off can be solved quite simply

speed, $c_s$. We review the significance for constraining sound speed models of
dark energy using large neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys with the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA). Our analysis considers the effect on the sound speed measurement
that arises from the covariance of $c_s$ with the dark energy density,
$\Omega_\LLambda$, and a time-varying equation of state, $w(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a$.
We find that the approximate degeneracy between dark energy parameters that
arises in power spectrum observations is lifted through redshift tomography of
the HI-galaxy angular power spectrum, resulting in sound speed constraints that
are not severely degraded. The cross-correlation of the galaxy and the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect spectra contributes approximately 10
percent of the information that is needed to distinguish variations in the dark
energy parameters, and most of the discriminating signal comes from the galaxy
auto-correlation spectrum. We also find that the sound speed constraints are
weakly sensitive to the HI bias model. These constraints do not improve
substantially for a significantly deeper HI survey since most of the clustering
sensitivity to sound speed variations arises from $z \lsim 1.5$. A detection of
models with sound speeds close to zero, $c_s \lsim 0.01,$ is possible for dark
energy models with $w\gsim -0.9$.

the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.

gradient by performing a biased random walk composed of alternating runs and
tumbles. This paper presents calculations of the chemotactic drift velocity vd
(the mean velocity up the chemoattractant gradient) of an E. coli cell
performing chemotaxis in a uniform, steady shear flow, with a weak
chemoattractant gradient at right angles to the flow. Extending earlier models,
a combined analytic and numerical approach is used to assess the effect of
several complications, namely (i) a cell cannot detect a chemoattractant
gradient directly but rather makes temporal comparisons of chemoattractant
concentration, (ii) the tumbles exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that
the swimming directions before and after a tumble are correlated, (iii) the
cell suffers random re-orientations due to rotational Brownian motion, and (iv)
the non-spherical shape of the cell affects the way that it is rotated by the
shear flow. These complications influence the dependence of vd on the shear
rate gamma. When they are all included, it is found that (a) shear disrupts
chemotaxis and shear rates beyond gamma = 2/second cause the cell to swim down
the chemoattractant gradient rather than up it, (b) in terms of maximising
drift velocity, persistence of direction is advantageous in a quiescent fluid
but disadvantageous in a shear flow, and (c) a more elongated body shape is
advantageous in performing chemotaxis in a strong shear flow.

L$_1$ or L$_2$ create correlations among the apocentric positions of many
chaotic orbits, thus supporting a {\it spiral} structure beyond the bar. In the
present paper we present evidence that the unstable manifolds of {\it all} the

the same phenomenon. Our results refer to a N-Body simulation, a number of
drawbacks of which, as well as the reasons why these do not significantly
affect the main results, are discussed. We explain the dynamical importance of
the invariant manifolds as due to the fact that they produce a phenomenon of
`stickiness' slowing down the rate of chaotic escape in an otherwise
non-compact region of the phase space. We find a stickiness time of order 100
dynamical periods, which is sufficient to support a long-living spiral
structure. Manifolds of different families become important at different ranges
of values of the Jacobi constant. The projections of the manifolds of all the
different families in the configuration space produce a pattern due to the
`coalescence' of the invariant manifolds. This follows closely the maxima of
the observed $m=2$ component near and beyond corotation. Thus, the manifolds
support both the outer edge of the bar and the spiral arms.

data, whilst dominated by emission from old stellar populations, is corrected
for small-scale contamination by young stars and PAH emission. The I band data
are used to produce a mass surface density map by a B-V colour-correction,
following the method of Bell and de Jong. We fit a bulge and exponential disc
to each mass map, and subtract these components to reveal the non-axisymmetric
mass surface density. From the residual mass maps we are able to extract the
amplitude and phase of the density wave, using azimuthal profiles. The response
of the gas is observed via dust emission in the 8micron IRAC band, allowing a
comparison between the phase of the stellar density wave and gas shock. The
relationship between this angular offset and radius suggests that the spiral
structure is reasonably long lived and allows the position of corotation to be
determined.

stage that precedes the slow roll regime. The fast roll stage leads to a purely
attractive potential for the curvature and tensor perturbations (this potential
is purely repulsive in slowroll). This attractive potential depresses the CMB
quadrupole moment for the curvature and B-mode spectra. A single new
cosmological parameter emerges: the comoving wavenumber k_1 characteristic
scale of this attractive potential.k_1 happens to exit the horizon precisely at
the transition from fast to slowroll.The fastroll stage dynamically modifies
the initial power spectrum by a transfer function D(k). We compute D(k) by
solving the inflaton evolution equations. D(k) suppresses the primordial power
for k < k_1 and enjoys the scaling property D(k) = Psi(k/k_1) where Psi(x) is
an universal function. We perform a MCMC analysis of the WMAP/SDSS data
including the fast-roll stage and find k_1 = 0.266/Gpc. The quadrupole mode k_Q
= 0.242/Gpc exits the horizon 1/10 of an efold before k_1. We compare the
fastroll fit with a fit with a sharp lower cutoff on the primordial power.
Fastroll provides a slightly better fit than a sharp cutoff for the TT,TE and
EE modes.Moreover, our fits provide non-zero lower bounds for r, while for the
other cosmological parameters we essentially get those of the LCDM model. The
fact that k_Q exits the horizon before the slowroll stage implies an upper
bound in the total number of efolds N_{tot} during inflation.Combining this
with estimates during the radiation dominated era we obtain N_{tot} ~ 66, with
the bounds 62 < N_{tot} < 82.We repeated the analysis with the

condensed-matter quantum problems.Here we find evidence that for intermediate
$U/4t$ values and a hole-concentration range $x\in (x_c,x_*)$ the ground state
of the Hubbard model on the square lattice perturbed by weak three-dimensional
(3D) uniaxial anisotropy has long-range d-wave superconducting order. Here $t$
is the effective nearest-neighbor transfer integral and $U$ the effective
on-site repulsion. The lower critical concentration $x_c$ involves the Ginzburg
number Gi and is approximately given by $x_c\approx {\rm Gi}+x_0\approx 0.05$.
Here $x_0<{\rm Gi}$ is a small critical hole concentration that marks a sharp
quantum phase transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator with long-range
antiferromagnetic order for $x<x_0$ to an Anderson insulator with short-range
incommensurate spiral spin order for $x\in (x_0,x_c)$. The value of the

emerges below a critical temperature $T_c$ for a hole concentration range
centered at $x_{op}= (x_c+x_*)/2\approx 0.16$. It results from the effects of
the residual interactions of the charge $c$ and spin-neutral two-spinon $s1$

mechanism of high-T$_C$ superconductivity might be linked to spin fluctuations.
Band calculations for long ""1-dimensional"" unit cells of La$_2$CuO$_4$ show
that the coupling between antiferromagnetic spin waves and phonons is larger
for distortions of oxygens than for Cu or La. When this result is applied to a
2-dimensional, free-electron like band, it leads to a q-dependent spin
excitation spectrum in good agreement with recent experiments. It is argued
that important parameters for spin-phonon coupling, which comes out from the
comparison between experiment and theory, are relevant for the mechanism of
superconductivity, and are large enough to explain a high T$_C$.

independent, identically distributed (iid) Gaussian model in order to derive
estimates that dominate least-squares (LS). In recent years, the SURE criterion
has been employed in a variety of denoising problems for choosing
regularization parameters that minimize an estimate of the mean-squared error
(MSE). However, its use has been limited to the iid case which precludes many
important applications. In this paper we begin by deriving a SURE counterpart
for general, not necessarily iid distributions from the exponential family.
This enables extending the SURE design technique to a much broader class of
problems. Based on this generalization we suggest a new method for choosing
regularization parameters in penalized LS estimators. We then demonstrate its
superior performance over the conventional generalized cross validation
approach and the discrepancy method in the context of image deblurring and
deconvolution. The SURE technique can also be used to design estimates without
predefining their structure. However, allowing for too many free parameters
impairs the performance of the resulting estimates. To address this inherent
tradeoff we propose a regularized SURE objective. Based on this design
criterion, we derive a wavelet denoising strategy that is similar in sprit to
the standard soft-threshold approach but can lead to improved MSE performance.
