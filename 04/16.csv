at the level of a two-derivative effective action. We derive the unique
perturbative tachyon potential consistent with a full class of linearized
tachyonic deformations of supercritical string theory. The solutions of
interest deform a general linear dilaton background by the insertion of purely
exponential tachyon vertex operators. In spacetime, the evolution of the
tachyon drives an accelerated contraction of the universe and, absent
higher-order corrections, the theory collapses to a cosmological singularity in
finite time, at arbitrarily weak string coupling. When the tachyon exhibits a
null symmetry, the worldsheet dynamics are known to be exact and well-defined
at tree level. We prove that if the two-derivative effective action is free of
non-gravitational singularities, higher-order corrections always resolve the
spacetime curvature singularity of the null tachyon. The resulting theory
provides an explicit mechanism by which tachyon condensation can generate or
terminate the flow of cosmological time in string theory. Additional particular
solutions can resolve an initial singularity with a tachyonic phase at weak
coupling, or yield solitonic configurations that localize the universe along
spatial directions.

with a primary at the top of the asymptotic giant branch. To determine the
impact of binarity on planetary nebula formation and shaping, we need to
determine the central star of planetary nebula binary fraction and period
distribution. The short-period binary fraction has been known to be 10-15% from
a survey of ~100 central stars for photometric variability indicative of
irradiation effects, ellipsoidal variability or eclipses. This survey technique
is known to be biased against binaries with long periods and this fact is used
to explain why the periods of all the binaries discovered by this survey are
smaller than 3 days. In this paper we assess the status of knowledge of binary
central stars discovered because of irradiation effects. We determine that, for
average parameters, this technique should be biased against periods longer than
1-2 weeks, so it is surprising that no binaries were found with periods longer
than 3 days. Even more puzzling is the fact that 9 out of 12 of the irradiated
binaries, have periods smaller than one day, a fact that is starkly at odds
with post-common envelope predictions. We suggest that either all common
envelope models tend to overestimate post-common envelope periods or that this
binary survey might have suffered from additional, unquantified biases. If the
latter hypothesis is true, the currently-known short-period binary fraction is
put in serious doubt. We also introduce a new survey for binary-related
variability, which will enable us to better quantify biases and determine an
independent value for the short period binary fraction.

studied through observations of its soft X-ray emission. The measurements were
obtained by attributing all of the observed local soft X-rays to the bubble.
However, mounting evidence shows that the heliosphere also produces diffuse
X-rays. The source is solar wind ions that have received an electron from
another atom. The presence of this alternate explanation for locally produced
diffuse X-rays calls into question the existence and character of the Local
Bubble. This article addresses these questions. It reviews the literature on
solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) X-ray production, finding that SWCX accounts
for roughly half of the observed local 1/4 keV X-rays found at low latitudes.
This article also makes predictions for the heliospheric O VI column density
and intensity, finding them to be smaller than the observational error bars.
Evidence for the continued belief that the Local Bubble contains hot gas
includes the remaining local 1/4 keV intensity, the observed local O VI column
density, and the need to fill the local region with some sort of plasma. If the
true Local Bubble is half as bright as previously thought, then its electron
density and thermal pressure are 1/square-root(2) as great as previously
thought, and its energy requirements and emission measure are 1/2 as great as
previously thought. These adjustments can be accommodated easily, and, in fact,
bring the Local Bubble's pressure more in line with that of the adjacent
material. Suggestions for future work are made.

some preliminary analysis of building heights from the Emporis database which
suggests very strong scaling in world cities. The data base for Greater London
is then introduced from which we extract 3.6 million buildings whose scaling
properties we explore. We examine key allometric relationships between these
different properties illustrating how building shape changes according to size,
and we extend this analysis to the classification of buildings according to
land use types. We conclude with an analysis of two-point correlation functions

formed either from the gas that was accreted by the last major mergers
experienced by the Galaxy, or by dynamical friction of massive infalling
satellite(s) with the halo and possibly the stellar disk or thick disk. The
remainder of the stars in our sample exhibit a clumpy distribution in energy
and angular momentum, suggesting that the early, chaotic conditions under which
the inner halo formed were not violent enough to erase the record of their
origins. The clumpy structure suggests that a relatively small number of
progenitors were responsible for building up the inner halo, in line with
theoretical expectations. We find a difference in mean binding energy between
the RR Lyrae variables and the red giants in our sample, suggesting that more
of the RR Lyraes in the sample belong to the outer halo, and that the outer
halo may be somewhat younger, as first suggested by Searle and Zinn (1978). We
also find that the RR Lyrae mean rotation is more negative than the red giants,

switching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals

reaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the
proposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of
constant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is
robust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder
is quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be
observed at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological
functions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation
interconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction
rates in the network.

have to be discarded. Then, we introduce partial states (which are partial

sources which lacks a closed formula even for subclasses of sources which have
intuitive parameterizations. A good way to overcome this problem is to examine
its analytic properties relative to some reasonable topology. A canonical
choice of a topology is that of the norm of total variation as it immediately
arises with the idea of a discrete random source as a probability measure on
sequence space. It is shown that entropy rate is Lipschitzian relative to this
topology, which, by well known facts, is close to differentiability. An
application of this theorem leads to a simple and elementary proof of the
existence of entropy rate of random sources with finite evolution dimension.
This class of sources encompasses arbitrary hidden Markov sources and quantum
random walks.

  April 2008",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the design of multiple-input multiple-output communication
systems with a linear precoder at the transmitter, zero-forcing decision
feedback equalization (ZF-DFE) at the receiver, and a low-rate feedback channel
that enables communication from the receiver to the transmitter. The channel
state information (CSI) available at the receiver is assumed to be perfect, and
based on this information the receiver selects a suitable precoder from a
codebook and feeds back the index of this precoder to the transmitter. Our
approach to the design of the components of this limited feedback scheme is
based on the development, herein, of a unified framework for the joint design
of the precoder and the ZF-DFE under the assumption that perfect CSI is
available at both the transmitter and the receiver. The framework is general
and embraces a wide range of design criteria. This framework enables us to
characterize the statistical distribution of the optimal precoder in a standard
Rayleigh fading environment. Using this distribution, we show that codebooks
constructed from Grassmann packings minimize an upper bound on an average
distortion measure, and hence are natural candidates for the codebook in
limited feedback systems. We also show that for any given codebook the
performance of the proposed limited feedback schemes is an upper bound on the
corresponding schemes with linear zero-forcing receivers. Our simulation
studies show that the proposed limited feedback scheme can provide
significantly better performance at a lower feedback rate than existing schemes
in which the detection order is fed back to the transmitter.

of this manifold. A variational method enables us to determine numerically a
large number of unstable spatiotemporally periodic solutions. The attracting
set appears surprisingly thin - its backbone are several Smale horseshoe
repellers, well approximated by intrinsic local 1-dimensional return maps, each
with an approximate symbolic dynamics. The dynamics appears decomposable into
chaotic dynamics within such local repellers, interspersed by rapid jumps
between them.

model of galaxy bias, to investigate voids in the galaxy distribution. Our goal
is to address the 'void phenomenon' of Peebles (2001), which presents the
observed dearth of faint galaxies in voids as a challenge to the current
cosmology. In our model, galaxy luminosity is determined only as a function of
dark matter halo mass. With this simple assumption, we demonstrate that large,
empty voids of ~15 Mpc/h in diameter are expected even for galaxies seven
magnitudes fainter than L*. The predictions of our model are in excellent
agreement with several statistical measures; (i) the luminosity function of
galaxies in underdense regions, (ii) nearest neighbor statistics of dwarf
galaxies, (iii) the void probability function of faint galaxies. In the
transition between filaments and voids in the dark matter, the halo mass
function changes abruptly, causing the maximum galaxy luminosity to decrease by
~5 magnitudes over a range of ~1 Mpc/h. Thus the boundary between filaments and
voids in the galaxy distribution is nearly as sharp for dwarfs as for ~L*
objects. These results support a picture in which galaxy formation is driven
predominantly by the mass of the host dark matter halo, and is nearly
independent of the larger-scale halo environment. Further, they demonstrate
that LCDM, combined with a straightforward bias model, naturally explains the
existence of the void phenomenon.

correspondence with representations of a wheeled dg prop which, on the one
hand, is isomorphic to the cobar construction of the prop of unimodular Lie
1-bialgebras and, on the other hand, is quasi-isomorphic to the dg wheeled prop
of unimodular Poisson structures. These results allow us to apply properadic
methods for computing formulae for a homotopy transfer of a unimodular Lie
1-bialgebra structure on an arbitrary complex to the associated quantum master
function on its cohomology. It is proven that in the category of quantum BV

  It is shown that Losev-Mnev's BF theory for unimodular Lie algebras can be

to the case of unimodular Poisson structures). Using a finite-dimensional

proven that the Feynman integrals computing the effective action of this new BF

to the mass-loss rate of AGB stars than metallicity, and that the mass-loss
trend with metallicity is not as simple as sometimes assumed. Using our
detailed radiation hydrodynamical models that include dust formation, we
illustrate the effects of pulsation energy on wind properties. We find that the
mass-loss rate scales with the kinetic energy input by pulsations as long as a
dust-saturated wind does not occur, and all other stellar parameters are kept
constant. This includes the absolute abundance of condensible carbon (not bound
in CO), which is more relevant than keeping the C/O-ratio constant when
comparing stars of different metallicity. The pressure and temperature
gradients in the atmospheres of stars, become steeper and flatter,
respectively, when the metallicity is reduced, while the radius where the
atmosphere becomes opaque is typically associated with a higher gas pressure.
This effect can be compensated for by adjusting the velocity amplitude of the
variable inner boundary (piston), which is used to simulate the effects of
pulsation, to obtain models with comparable kinetic-energy input. Hence, it is
more relevant to compare models with similar energy-injections than of similar
velocity amplitude. Since there is no evidence for weaker pulsations in
low-metallicity AGB stars, we conclude that it is unlikely that low-metallicity
C-stars have a lower mass-loss rate, than their more metal-rich counterparts
with similar stellar parameters, as long as they have a comparable amount of
condensible carbon.

halo, the reason for the dependence of the model parameters on the Galactic
longitude arises from the well known asymmetric structure of this component.
However, the variation of the model parameters of the thin and thick discs with
Galactic longitude originates from the gravitational effect of the Galactic
long bar. Moreover, the excess of stars in quadrant I (quadrant III) over
quadrant IV (quadrant II) is in agreement with this scenario.

Their symbolic calculus is noncommutative, and involves analysis on the

significant differential rotation. The equator-pole laptimes as determined from

secondary. Similarly for the magnetic spectra we obtain equator-pole laptimes
of 44 and 71 days respectively, showing that the shearing timescale of magnetic
regions is approximately half that found for stellar spots. Both components are
therefore found to have rates of differential rotation similar to those of the
same spectral type main sequence single stars. The results for HD 155555 are
therefore in contrast to those found in other, more evolved, binary systems
where negligible or weak differential rotation has been discovered. We discuss
two possible explanations for this; firstly that at the age of HD 155555 binary
tidal forces have not yet had time to suppress differential rotation, secondly
that the weak differential rotation previously observed on evolved binaries is
a consequence of their large convection zone depths. We suggest that the latter
is the more likely solution and show that both temperature and convection zone
depth (from evolutionary models) are good predictors of differential rotation
strength. Finally, we also examine the possible consequences of the measured

one another with a period of 18.971 +/- 0.006 days and a semimajor axis of 1628
+/- 29 km, implying a system mass of (9.49 +/- 0.52) x 10^17 kg. The
eccentricity of the orbit is 0.526 +/- 0.015. Combined with a radiometric size
determined from Spitzer Space Telescope data and the assumption that Typhon and
Echidna both have the same albedo, we estimate that their radii are 76 +14/-16
and 42 +8/-9 km, respectively. These numbers give an average bulk density of
only 0.44 +0.44/-0.17 g cm^-3, consistent with very low bulk densities recently
reported for two other small transneptunian binaries.

mathematical fluid dynamics, since this problem not only arises in many
important physical situations but also is fundamental for the theory of
multidimensional conservation laws. However, most of the fundamental issues for
shock reflection have not been understood. Therefore, it is important to
establish the regularity of solutions to shock reflection in order to
understand fully the phenomena of shock reflection. On the other hand, for a
regular reflection configuration, the potential flow governs the exact behavior
of the solution in $C^{1,1}$ across the pseudo-sonic circle even starting from
the full Euler flow, that is, both of the nonlinear systems are actually the
same in an physically significant region near the pseudo-sonic circle; thus, it
becomes essential to understand the optimal regularity of solutions for the
potential flow across the pseudo-sonic circle and at the point where the
pseudo-sonic circle meets the reflected shock. In this paper, we study the
regularity of solutions to regular shock reflection for potential flow. In
particular, we prove that the $C^{1,1}$-regularity is optimal for the solution
across the pseudo-sonic circle and at the point where the pseudo-sonic circle
meets the reflected shock. We also obtain the $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity of the
solution up to the pseudo-sonic circle in the pseudo-subsonic region. The
problem involves two types of transonic flow: one is a continuous transition
through the pseudo-sonic circle from the pseudo-supersonic region to the
pseudo-subsonic region; the other a jump transition through the transonic shock
as a free boundary from another pseudo-supersonic region to the pseudo-subsonic
region.

universal value is found for the anisotropy ratio of the transition temperature
in a magnetic field, homogeneous magnetization, and induced staggered

PrRu$_4$P$_{12}$ near their phase transitions is explained within a single
framework. For the low-field phase of PrFe$_4$P$_{12}$, the scalar order with
the $\Gamma_{1g}$ symmetry can explain (i) the absence of field induced dipoles
perpendicular to the magnetic field, (ii) isotropic magnetic susceptibility in
the ordered phase, (iii) the field angle dependence of the transition

clearly lagged behind that observed in the soft X-rays, with the maximum lag of

depends on the strength of thermal forcing in the limit of very large thermal
forcing. Kraichnan predicted [Phys. Fluids {\bf 5}, 1374 (1962)] that the heat
transport measured by the Nusselt number (Nu) would depend on the strength of
thermal forcing measured by the Rayleigh number (Ra) as Nu $\sim$ Ra$^{1/2}$
with possible logarithmic corrections at very high Ra. This scaling behavior is
taken as a signature of the so-called ultimate state of turbulent convection.
The ultimate state was interpreted in the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory [J. Fluid
Mech. {\bf 407}, 27 (2000)] as a bulk-dominated state in which both the kinetic
and thermal dissipation are dominated by contributions from the bulk of the
flow with the boundary layers either broken down or playing no role in the heat
transport. In this paper, we study the dependence of Nu and the Reynolds number
(Re) measuring the root-mean-squared velocity fluctuations on Ra and the
Prandtl number (Pr) using a shell model for homogeneous turbulent convection
where buoyancy is acting directly on most of the scales. We find that Nu$\sim$
Ra$^{1/2}$Pr$^{1/2}$ and Re$\sim$ Ra$^{1/2}$Pr$^{-1/2}$, which resemble the
ultimate-state scaling behavior for fluids with moderate Pr, but the presence
of a drag acting on the large scales is crucial in giving rise to such scaling.
This suggests that if buoyancy acts on most of the scales in the bulk of
turbulent convection at very high Ra, then the ultimate state cannot be a
bulk-dominated state.

principles the origin of anomalous scaling of the velocity fluctuations in
high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. One important idea was proposed by
Kolmogorov [J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 13}, 82 (1962)], which attributes the anomaly
to the variations of the locally averaged energy dissipation rate. Kraichnan
later pointed out [J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 62}, 305 (1973)] that the locally
averaged energy dissipation rate is not an inertial-range quantity and a proper
inertial-range quantity would be the local energy transfer rate. As a result,
Kraichnan's idea attributes the anomaly to the variations of the local energy
transfer rate. These ideas, generally known as refined similarity hypotheses,
can also be extended to study the anomalous scaling of fluctuations of an
active scalar, like the temperature in turbulent convection. In this paper, we
examine the validity of these refined similarity hypotheses and their
extensions to an active scalar in shell models of turbulence. We find that

expressed as the Fredholm determinant of an integral operator, most notably
many of the distribution functions in random matrix theory. Though their
numerical values are of interest, there is no systematic numerical treatment of
Fredholm determinants to be found in the literature. Instead, the few numerical
evaluations that are available rely on eigenfunction expansions of the
operator, if expressible in terms of special functions, or on alternative,
numerically more straightforwardly accessible analytic expressions, e.g., in
terms of Painleve transcendents, that have masterfully been derived in some
cases. In this paper we close the gap in the literature by studying projection
methods and, above all, a simple, easily implementable, general method for the
numerical evaluation of Fredholm determinants that is derived from the
classical Nystrom method for the solution of Fredholm equations of the second
kind. Using Gauss-Legendre or Clenshaw-Curtis as the underlying quadrature
rule, we prove that the approximation error essentially behaves like the
quadrature error for the sections of the kernel. In particular, we get
exponential convergence for analytic kernels, which are typical in random
matrix theory. The application of the method to the distribution functions of
the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), in the bulk and the edge scaling limit, is
discussed in detail. After extending the method to systems of integral
operators, we evaluate the two-point correlation functions of the more recently
studied Airy and Airy1 processes for the first time.

different broadening parameters of Gaussian-shaped Landau levels cause width

One of the major difficulties is the presence of the two-pseudoscalar

In the simulations with unphysical approximations such scattering contributions
are even more disturbing since they are often large and sometimes negative.
Techniques which allow extraction of scalar meson masses in presence of

possibilities for very large and indeed negative Casimir forces if the
frequency-dependent dielectric response, $\epsilon(\omega)$, of the materials

of the effect of a perturbation of $\epsilon(\omega)$ involving a Wick rotation
to imaginary frequencies indicate only very modest effects. A recent experiment

detailed analysis of the injection mechanism into observable orbits by
comparing the complete model with separate models for tidal and stellar
perturbations alone. We find that a fundamental role for injecting comets from
the region outside the loss cone (perihelion distance q > 15 AU) into
observable orbits (q < 5 AU) is played by stellar perturbations. These act in
synergy with the tide such that the total injection rate is significantly
larger than the sum of the two separate rates. This synergy is as important
during comet showers as during quiescent periods and concerns comets with both
small and large semi-major axes. We propose different dynamical mechanisms to
explain the synergies in the inner and outer parts of the Oort Cloud. We find

We show there is a good agreement between the theoretical solution and Monte
Carlo simulation data, even under these extreme conditions. We also discuss an
extended theoretical solution that would work for large inelasticities in
ranges of shear rate $a$ not covered by our previous work (i.e., below the
threshold value $a_{th}$ for which uniform shear flow may be obtained) and
compare also with simulation data. Preliminary results in the simulations give
useful insight in order to obtain an exact and general solution of the
nonlinear Couette flow (both for $a\ge a_{th}$ and $a<a_{th}$).

jet flow is always supercritical independently of the dispersed liquid flow
rate: within these relatively broad regions, the jet does not undergo the usual
dripping-jetting transition, so that either the jet can be made arbitrarily
thin (yielding droplets of any imaginably small size), or the issued flow rate
can be made arbitrarily small. In this work, we provide illustrative analytical
studies of asymptotic cases for both negligible and dominant inertia forces. In
this latter case, requiring a non-zero jet surface velocity, axisymmetric
perturbation waves ``surf'' downstream for all given wave numbers while the

both theories permits to quantify precisely discreteness effects in the linear

because they represent different discretizations of the same continuous system.
In this paper we detail how to implement the PLT for perturbed cubic Bravais

application, we will study the discreteness effects -- in the linear regime --
of N-body simulations for which initial conditions have been set-up using these

of densely packed GaSb cones approximately 50nm high, on bulk GaSb. The
nanostructured surfaces are here shown to considerably modify the optical

spectroscopic (Mueller matrix) ellipsometric measurements. The off-specular
scattering and the depolarization is found to be low. The anisotropic response
is particularly emphasized by studying nano-structured GaSb cones approximately
45 degrees tilted with respect to the surface normal. In the latter case, one
observes upon rotating the sample around the surface normal, that the Mueller
matrix elements $m_{13}$ and $m_{14}$ oscillate as a function of the rotation

such a way that the coalescence times between consecutive individuals are
i.i.d. The ranked sequence of these branches is called a coalescent point
process. We have shown in a previous work that splitting trees are important
instances of such populations. Here, individuals are given DNA sequences, and
for a sample of $n$ DNA sequences belonging to distinct individuals, we
consider the number $S_n$ of polymorphic sites (sites at which at least two
sequences differ), and the number $A_n$ of distinct haplotypes (sequences
differing at one site at least). It is standard to assume that mutations arrive
at constant rate (on germ lines), and never hit the same site on the DNA
sequence. We study the mutation pattern associated to coalescent point
processes under this assumption. Here, $S_n$ and $A_n$ grow linearly as $n$
grows, with explicit rate. However, when the branch lengths have infinite
expectation, $S_n$ grows more rapidly, e.g. as $n \ln(n)$ for critical
birth--death processes. Then, we study the frequency spectrum of the sample,

in the sample. These numbers are shown to grow also linearly with sample size,

  (i) The nonzero component of the source four-velocity does not have to be u0.
This provides a connection from the above ansatz to the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)

two are tachyonic. The dynamic tachyonic case was anticipated in the
literature, but the static tachyonic case seems to be new. We derive

regimes. When $\delta <d$, the networks are not affected at all by the spatial
constraints. They are ``small-worlds'' $l\sim \log N$ with zero clustering at
the thermodynamic limit. In the intermediate regime $d<\delta<2d$, the networks
are affected by the space and the distance increases and becomes a power of
$\log N$, and have non-zero clustering. When $\delta>2d$ the networks are
``large'' worlds $l \sim N^{1/d}$ with high clustering. Our results indicate
that spatial constrains have a significant impact on the network properties, a
fact that should be taken into account when modeling complex networks.

show that this nonlinearity leads to an instability in the intracavity

moments of all orders. There are two families of orthogonal polynomials
associated with $X$. On one hand, the Kailath--Segall formula gives the
relationship between the iterated integrals and the variations of order $n$ of
$X$, and defines a family of polynomials $P_1(x_1), P_2(x_1,x_2),...$ that are
orthogonal with respect to the joint law of the variations of $X$. On the other
hand, we can construct a sequence of orthogonal polynomials $p^{\sigma}_n(x)$
with respect to the measure $\sigma^2\delta_0(dx)+x^2 \nu(dx)$, where
$\sigma^2$ is the variance of the Gaussian part of $X$ and $\nu$ its L\'{e}vy
measure. These polynomials are the building blocks of a kind of chaotic
representation of the square functionals of the L\'{e}vy process proved by
Nualart and Schoutens. The main objective of this work is to study the
probabilistic properties and the relationship of the two families of
polynomials. In particular, the L\'{e}vy processes such that the associated
polynomials $P_n(x_1,...,x_n)$ depend on a fixed number of variables are
characterized. Also, we give a sequence of L\'{e}vy processes that converge in
the Skorohod topology to $X$, such that all variations and iterated integrals
of the sequence converge to the variations and iterated integrals of $X$.

procedures are biased towards preferentially observing the more metal--poor and
luminous stars of $\omega$ Cen. Abundances were determined using equivalent
width measurements and spectrum synthesis analyses of moderate resolution
spectra (R$\approx$13,000) obtained with the Blanco 4m telescope and Hydra
multifiber spectrograph. Our results are in agreement with previous studies as
we find at least four different metallicity populations with [Fe/H]=--1.75,
--1.45, --1.05, and --0.75, with a full range of --2.20$\la$[Fe/H]$\la$--0.70.
[Al/Fe] ratios exhibit large star--to--star scatter for all populations, with
the more than 1.0 dex range of [Al/Fe] decreasing for stars more metal--rich
than [Fe/H]$\sim$--1.4. The minimum [Al/Fe] abundance observed for all
metallicity populations is [Al/Fe]$\sim$+0.15. The maximum abundance of log
$\epsilon$(Al) is reached for stars with [Fe/H]$\sim$--1.4 and does not
increase further with stellar metallicity. We interpret these results as
evidence for type II SNe providing the minimum [Al/Fe] ratio and a mass
spectrum of intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars causing the
majority of the [Al/Fe] scatter. These results seem to fit in the adopted
scheme that star formation occurred in $\omega$ Cen over $>$1 Gyr.

scenario for the study of disorder-induced localization, due to high degree of
control of most of the system parameters, including interaction. Here we employ
for the first time a noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate to study Anderson
localization. The experiment is performed with a onedimensional quasi-periodic
lattice, a system which features a crossover between extended and exponentially
localized states as in the case of purely random disorder in higher dimensions.
Localization is clearly demonstrated by investigating transport properties,
spatial and momentum distributions. We characterize the crossover, finding that
the critical disorder strength scales with the tunnelling energy of the atoms
in the lattice. Since the interaction in the condensate can be controlled at
will, this system might be employed to solve open questions on the interplay of
disorder and interaction and to explore exotic quantum phases.

  Our examples reproduce first of all many familiar logarithmic representations

conformal field theory of zero central charge. In this case one encounters

expectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs scalars. We run two-loop renormalization
group equations (RGEs), for all parameters involved, including phases, and we
properly treat the minimization conditions using the one-loop effective

of phases may induce sizable effects for the electric dipole moments (EDMs)

EDMs are induced by the Higgs VEVs misalignment angle which are sizable in the
large tanb region. Scanning the available parameter space we seek regions
compatible with accelerator and cosmological data with emphasis on rapid
neutralino annihilations through a Higgs resonance. It is shown that large

candidate to evolve into an SNIa. We present a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of
the quiescent accretion and the subsequent explosive phase. The computed
circumstellar mass distribution in the quiescent phase is highly structured
with a mass enhancement in the orbital plane of about a factor of 2 as compared
to the poleward directions. The simulated nova remnant evolves aspherically,
propagating faster toward the poles. The shock velocities derived from the
simulations are in agreement with those derived from observations. For v_RG =
20 km/s and for nearly isothermal flows, we derive a mass transfer rate to the
WD of 10% of the mass loss of the RG. For an RG mass loss of 10^{-7} solar
masses per year, we found the orbit of the system to decay by 3% per million
years. With the derived mass transfer rate, multi-cycle nova models provide a
qualitatively correct recurrence time, amplitude, and fastness of the nova. Our
simulations provide, along with the observations and nova models, the third
ingredient for a deeper understanding of the recurrent novae of the RS Oph
type. In combination with recent multi-cycle nova models, our results suggests
that the WD in RS Oph will increase in mass. Several speculative outcomes then
seem plausible. The WD may reach the Chandrasekhar limit and explode as an SN
Ia. Alternatively, the mass loss of the RG could result in a smaller Roche
volume, a common envelope phase, and a narrow WD+WD system. Angular momentum
loss due to graviational wave emission could trigger the merger of the two WDs
and - perhaps - an SN Ia via the double degenerate scenario.
