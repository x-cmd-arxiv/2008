Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, LEP event shape data is used to derive strong
model-independent bounds on new colored particles. In the effective field
theory computation, colored particles contribute in loops not only to the
running of alpha_s but also to the running of hard, jet and soft functions.
Moreover, the differential distribution in the effective theory explicitly
probes many energy scales, so event shapes have strong sensitivity to new
particle thresholds. Using thrust data from ALEPH and OPAL, colored adjoint
fermions (such as a gluino) below 51.0 GeV are ruled out to 95% confidence
level. This is nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous
model-independent bound of 6.3 GeV.

absence of FCNCs. In the case of massive neutrinos, the contributions to FCNCs
in the charged lepton sector are highly suppressed, due to the smallness of

one-loop charged current contributions to flavor changing processes by reducing
the size of the Yukawa couplings, which is not possible in the generic
anarchical case. We found that the first KK mass scale as low as ~ 3 TeV can be
allowed. In both cases, we present a set of numerical results that give rise to
realistic lepton masses and mixing angles. Mild hierarchy in the 5D Yukawa

solve the mean-field equation of state of the modified Popov theory, and
compare it with the usual Hartree-Fock theory. We show that even though the
former theory does not suffer from infrared divergences in both the normal and

discontinuity is resolved. The flow equations in two dimensions, in particular,
of the symmetry-broken phase, already contain some unique features pertinent to
the 2D XY model, even though vortices have not been included explicitly. We
also compute various many-body correlators, and show that correlation effects
beyond the Hartree-Fock theory are important already in the normal phase as
criticality is approached. We finally extend our results to the inhomogeneous
case of a trapped Bose gas using the local-density approximation and show that

3-year WMAP data, in agreement with simpler analyses that assume instantaneous
reionization. The mean value of the optical depth from principal components is
slightly larger than the instantaneous value; we find tau=0.097+/-0.017 using

that extracting most of the remaining information about the shape of the

al., (2006), where the foreground spectral parameters are estimated prior to
the actual separation of the components. In contrast with the previous
approaches, we accomplish the former task with help of an analytically-derived
likelihood function for the spectral parameters, which, we show, yields
estimates equal to the maximum likelihood values of the full multi-dimensional
data problem. We then use these estimates to perform the second step via the
standard, generalized-least-square-like procedure. We demonstrate that the
proposed approach is equivalent to a direct maximization of the full data
likelihood, which is recast in a computationally tractable form. We use the
corresponding curvature matrices to characterize statistical properties of the
recovered parameters. We incorporate in the formalism some of the essential
features of the CMB data sets, such as inhomogeneous pixel domain noise,
unknown map offsets as well as calibration errors and study their consequences
for the separation. We find that the calibration is likely to have a dominant
effect on the precision of the spectral parameter determination for a realistic
CMB experiment. We apply the algorithm to simulated data and discuss the
results. Our focus is on partial-sky, total-intensity and polarization, CMB
experiments such as planned balloon-borne and ground-based efforts, however,
the techniques presented here should be also applicable to the full-sky data as

sensory ability of migratory birds to navigate using earths magnetic field,
have been narrowed down to spin-dependent recombination of radical-ion pairs to
be found in avian species retinal proteins. The avian magnetic field detection
is governed by the interplay between magnetic interactions of the radicals
unpaired electrons and the radicals recombination dynamics. Critical to this
mechanism is the long lifetime of the radical-pair spin coherence, so that the
weak geomagnetic field will have a chance to signal its presence. It is here
shown that a fundamental quantum phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, is at the
basis of the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism. The quantum Zeno
effect naturally leads to long spin coherence lifetimes, without any
constraints on the systems physical parameters, ensuring the robustness of this
sensory mechanism. Basic experimental observations regarding avian magnetic
sensitivity are seamlessly derived. These include the magnetic sensitivity
functional window and the heading error of oriented bird ensembles, which so
far evaded theoretical justification. The findings presented here could be
highly relevant to similar mechanisms at work in photosynthetic reactions. They
also trigger fundamental questions about the evolutionary mechanisms that
enabled avian species to make optimal use of quantum measurement laws.

diffraction-pattern imaging; and broadband thin-lens imaging. It is shown that
the spatial resolution behavior in both cases is controlled by the nonzero

the same resolution can be achieved in these two configurations with

Using a phenomenological tight binding model we show that the Fermi surface of
the 111 surface states encloses an odd number of time reversal invariant
momenta (TRIM) in the surface Brillouin zone confirming that the alloy is a
strong topological insulator. We then develop general arguments which show that
spatial symmetries lead to additional topological structure, and further
constrain the surface band structure. Inversion symmetric crystals have 8 Z_2
""parity invariants"", which include the 4 Z_2 invariants due to time reversal.
The extra invariants determine the ""surface fermion parity"", which specifies
which surface TRIM are enclosed by an odd number of electron or hole pockets.
We provide a simple proof of this result, which provides a direct link between
the surface states and the bulk parity eigenvalues. We then make specific
predictions for the surface state structure for several faces of BiSb. We next
show that mirror invariant band structures are characterized by an integer
""mirror Chern number"", n_M. The sign of n_M in the topological insulator phase
of BiSb is related to a previously unexplored Z_2 parameter in the L point k.p
theory of pure Bi, which we refer to as the ""mirror chirality"", \eta. The value
of \eta predicted by the tight binding model for Bi disagrees with the value
predicted by a more fundamental pseudopotential calculation. This explains a
subtle disagreement between our tight binding surface state calculation and
previous first principles calculations on Bi. This suggests that the tight
binding parameters in the Liu Allen model of Bi need to be reconsidered.
Implications for existing and future ARPES experiments and spin polarized ARPES

SDSSJ0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a
broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before.
The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission
with a broad base, narrow core and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong HeII
emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have
faded away significantly in new spectra taken in December 2007. Comparison of
SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the
NUV, optical and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be
explained by a giant outburst in the EUV--X-ray band, detected even in the
optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, Helium and Balmer lines
represent the ``light echo'' of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear
material. The outburst may have been caused by the tidal disruption of a star
by a supermassive black hole. Spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS are well
suited to detect emission-line light echoes of such rare flare events.
Reverberation-mapping of these light echoes can then be used as a new and
efficient probe of the physical conditions in the circumnuclear material in
non-active or active galaxies.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies via three different fueling
mechanisms: major mergers, minor mergers, and disk instabilities. The SMBHs in
all three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (BHFP) and
correlation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, and
observed locally. Furthermore, provided that the total gas supply is
significantly larger than the mass of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not
influenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black hole
growth. This supports the assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a
critical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,
terminating the inflow and stalling further growth. At the same time, while
minor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the
$M_{BH}-\sigma$ and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk instabilities do
not, owing to structural differences between the host bulges. This finding is
supported by recent observations of SMBHs in pseudobulges and bulges in barred
systems, as compared to those hosted by classical bulges. Taken together, this
provides support for the BHFP and binding energy correlations as being more
""fundamental"" than other proposed correlations in that they reflect the
physical mechanism driving the co-evolution of SMBHs and spheroids.

investigated by the electrical resistivity and thermopower measurements up to
800-1000 K. Special attention was given to effects of extra holes or electrons,
introduced by light doping of Co sites by Mg2+ or Ti4+ ions. The experiments on
the La based compounds were complemented with magnetic measurements. The study
shows that both kinds of charge carriers induce magnetic states on surrounding
CoIII sites and form thus thermally stable polarons of large total spin. Their
itinerancy is characterized by low temperature resistivity, which is of
Arrhenius type r~exp(EA/kT) for the hole (CoIV) doped samples, while an unusual
dependence r~1/Tn (n=8-10) is observed for the electron (CoII) doped samples.
At higher temperatures, additional hole carriers are massively populated in the
CoIII background, leading to a resistivity drop. This transition become evident
at ~300 K and 450 K and culminates at TI-M=540 and 780 K for the La and Dy
based samples, respectively.
  The electronic behaviours of the cobaltites are explained considering two
excitation processes in parent compounds. The first one is related to a local
excitation from the diamagnetic LS CoIII to close-lying paramagnetic HS CoIII
state. Secondarily, a metallic phase of the IS CoIII character is formed
through a charge transfer mechanism between LS/HS pairs. The magnetic polarons
associated with doped carriers are interpreted as droplets of such IS phase.

difference being a deficit of disk--dominated (B/T < 0.2) galaxies in the group
samples. At fixed luminosity, z=0.4 groups have ~ 5.5 +/- 2 % fewer
disk--dominated galaxies than the field, while by z=0.1 this difference has
increased to ~ 19 +/- 6 %. Despite the morphological evolution we see no
evidence that the group environment is actively perturbing or otherwise
affecting the entire existing disk population. At both redshifts, the disks of
group galaxies have similar scaling relations and show similar median
asymmetries as the disks of field galaxies. We do find evidence that the
fraction of highly asymmetric, bulge--dominated galaxies is 6 +/- 3 % higher in
groups than in the field, suggesting there may be enhanced merging in group
environments. We replicate our group samples at z=0.4 and z=0 using the
semi-analytic galaxy catalogues of Bower et al (2006). This model accurately
reproduces the B/T distributions of the group and field at z=0.1. However, the

for the physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in suitably

inversion of Stokes profiles caused by the joint action of atomic level
polarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects in some spectral lines of
diagnostic interest, such as those of the He I 10830 A and D_3 multiplets. It
is based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which takes into
account all the relevant physical mechanisms and ingredients (optical pumping,
atomic level polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back and Hanle effects). The
influence of radiative transfer on the emergent spectral line radiation is
taken into account through a suitable slab model. The user can either calculate
the emergent intensity and polarization for any given magnetic field vector or
infer the dynamical and magnetic properties from the observed Stokes profiles
via an efficient inversion algorithm based on global optimization methods. The
reliability of the forward modeling and inversion code presented here is
demonstrated through several applications, which range from the inference of
the magnetic field vector in solar active regions to determining whether or not
it is canopy-like in quiet chromospheric regions. This user-friendly diagnostic

adapted. The Kac--Thompson solution [KT] of the spherical model, which holds
for spacially homogeneous interaction, is firstly extended to hierarchical
model whose interaction fails to be translation invariant. Then, the
convergence proof of O(N) Heisenberg to the spherical model by Kunz and Zumbach
[KZ] is extended to the long range hierarchical interaction. We also examine
whether these results can be carried over as the size of the hierarchical block
L goes to 1. These extensions are considered a preliminary study prior the
investigation of the model by renormalization group given in [MCG] where
central limit theorems for the spherical (N=\infty) model on the local
potential approximation (L\downarrow 1) are then established from an explicit
solution of the associate nonlinear first order partial differential equation.

how to interpret observations made in regions of strong magnetic field as
isolating the effects of the magnetic field from thermal or sound-speed

these effects is by using a 3D sunspot model, with a surrounding stratified,
quiet-Sun atmosphere to model the magneto-acoustic ray propagation, and analyze
the resulting ray travel-time perturbations that will directly account for the
magnetic field. These artificial travel-time perturbation profiles have
provided us with several related but distinct observations: i) that strong
surface magnetic fields have a dual effect on helioseismic rays -- increasing
their skip distance while at the same time speeding them up considerably
compared to their quiet-Sun counterparts, ii) there is a clear and significant
frequency dependence of both skip-distance and travel-time perturbations across
the simulated sunspot radius, iii) the negative sign and magnitude of these
perturbations appears to be directly related to the sunspot magnetic-field
strength and inclination, iv) by ``switching off'' the magnetic field inside
the sunspot, we are able to completely isolate the thermal component of the
travel-time perturbations observed, which is seen to be both opposite in sign
and much smaller in magnitude than those measured when the magnetic field is
present. These results tend to suggest that purely thermal perturbations are
unlikely to be the main effect seen in travel times through sunspots and that
strong, near-surface magnetic fields may be directly and significantly altering
the magnitude and lateral extent of sound-speed inversions of sunspots made by
time-distance helioseismology.

intra-layer transport is sensitive only to the momentum-averaged scattering
probability (the transport relaxation rate) the resistivity perpendicular to

of such a spurious solitary wave, which exhibits a very long life time, results
in a non-vanishing numerical error for arbitrary time in unbounded numerical
domain. Such a behavior is referred here to has a structural instability of the
scheme, since the space of solutions spanned by the numerical scheme
encompasses types of solutions (solitary waves in the present case) that are
not solution of the original continuous equations. This paper extends our

cuprate Nd(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4) (NCCO) is calculated within the pseudo gap

LDA/DFT (density functional theory within local density approximation) provides
model parameters (hopping integral values, local Coulomb interaction strength)
for the one-band Hubbard model, which is solved by DMFT (dynamical mean-field
theory). To take into account pseudogap fluctuations LDA+DMFT is supplied with
""external"" k-dependent self-energy Sigma_k, which describes interaction of
correlated conducting electrons with non-local Heisenberg-like
antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations responsible for pseudo gap formation.
Within this LDA+DMFT+Sigma_k approach we demonstrate the formation of
pronounced ""hot-spots"" on the Fermi surface (FS) map in NCCO, opposite to our
recent calculations for Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8-d) (Bi2212), which have produced
rather extended region of FS ""destruction"". There are several physical reasons
for this fact: (i) the ""hot-spots"" in NCCO are located closer to Brillouin zone
center; (ii) correlation length of AFM fluctuations \xi is larger for NCCO;
(iii) pseudogap potential \Delta is stronger, than in Bi2212. Comparison of our
theoretical data with recent bulk sensitive high-energy angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES) data for NCCO provides good semiquantitative agreement.
Based on that comparison alternative explanation of the van-Hove singularity at
-0.3 eV is proposed. Optical conductivity both for Bi2212 and NCCO is also

demonstrating satisfactory agreement.

motion) of the rigid plane (in which the dipole moment $\approx 3.6 D$ lies) of
a favourably located and oriented peptide group (or may be a few of them). Thus
the rocking of the plane leads to fluctuations of the electric field of the
dipole moment. These fluctuations can interact with the reaction coordinate
because the latter in its turn has transition dipole moment due to separation
of charges at movement of the reacting system along it. The rocking of the
plane of the peptide group is sensitive to the microviscosity of its
environment in protein interior and the latter is a function of the solvent
viscosity. Thus we obtain an additional factor of interrelationship for these
characteristics with the reaction rate constant. We argue that due to the
properties of the cranckshaft motion the frequency spectrum of the electric
field fluctuations has a sharp resonance peak at some frequency and the
corresponding Fourier mode can be approximated as oscillations. We employ a
known result from the theory of thermally activated escape with periodic
driving to obtain the reaction rate constant and argue that it yields reliable
description of the preexponent where the dependence on solvent viscosity
manifests itself. The suggested mechanism is shown to grasp the main feature of
this dependence known from the experiment and satisfactorily yields the upper
limit of the fractional index of a power in it.

$\Delta$-mediated single-pion production from nuclei. We assess the ambiguities
stemming from the $\Delta$ interactions. Variations in the cross sections of
over 10% are observed, depending on whether or not magnetic-dipole dominance is
assumed to extract the vector form factors. These uncertainties have a direct
impact on the accuracy with which the axial-vector form factors can be
extracted. Different predictions for $C_5^A(Q^2)$ induce up to 40-50% effects
on the $\Delta$-production cross sections. To describe the nucleus, we turn to
a relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (RPWIA) using realistic
bound-state wave functions derived in the Hartree approximation to the
$\sigma$-$\omega$ Walecka model. For neutrino energies larger than 1 GeV, we
show that a relativistic Fermi-gas model with appropriate binding-energy
correction produces comparable results as the RPWIA which naturally includes
Fermi motion, nuclear-binding effects and the Pauli exclusion principle.
Including $\Delta$ medium modifications yields a 20 to 25% reduction of the
RPWIA cross section. The model presented in this work can be naturally extended
to include the effect of final-state interactions in a relativistic and
quantum-mechanical way. Guided by recent neutrino-oscillation experiments, such
as MiniBooNE and K2K, and future efforts like MINER$\nu$A, we present $Q^2$,
$W$, and various semi-inclusive distributions, both for a free nucleon and

quantities) for 2-dimensional Hamiltonian systems are treated in a unified way.
This is achieved by utilizing the Jacobi metric geometrization of the dynamics.
Using Killing tensors we obtain an integrability condition for quadratic
invariants which involves an arbitrary analytic function $S(z)$. For invariants
at arbitrary energy the function $S(z)$ is a second degree polynomial with real
second derivative. The integrability condition then reduces to Darboux's
condition for quadratic invariants at arbitrary energy. The four types of

are shown to correspond to certain conformal transformations. We derive the
explicit relation between invariants in the physical and Jacobi time gauges. In
this way knowledge about the invariant in the physical time gauge enables one
to directly write down the components of the corresponding Killing tensor for
the Jacobi metric. We also discuss the possibility of searching for linear and
quadratic invariants at fixed energy and its connection to the problem of the
third integral in galactic dynamics. In our approach linear and quadratic
invariants at fixed energy can be found by solving a linear ordinary

addition to that given by accounting prices, has to be introduced in order to
derive a correct estimate of the genuine wealth of an economy. In a simple
model with multiplicative accumulation dynamics I show that: 1) the value
function is always a decreasing function of volatility 2) the accounting prices
are affected by volatility 3) the new term always gives a negative contribution
to wealth changes. I discuss results for models with constant elasticity
utility functions. When the elasticity of marginal utility is larger than one,
accounting prices increase with volatility whereas when it is less than one
accounting prices decrease with volatility. These conclusions are not altered

this Andreev-Klein process results in an enhancement of the subgap conductance
of a graphene FS junction by $h$ up to the point at which the conductance at
low voltages $eV\ll \Delta$ is greater than its value for the corresponding

different forms of the effective Hamiltonian. Such an ambiguity of the choice
of this expression from some class of functions is allowed in the framework of
loop quantisation. Our main goal is to show how such modifications can
influence the bouncing universe scenario in the loop quantum cosmology. In
effective models considered we classify all evolutional paths for all
admissible initial conditions. The dynamics is reduced to the form of a
dynamical system of the Newtonian type on a 2-dimensional phase plane. These
models are equivalent dynamically to the FRW models with the decaying effective
cosmological term parametrised by the canonical variable $p$ (or by the scale
factor $a$). We find that for the positive cosmological constant there is a
class of oscillating models without the initial and final singularities. The
new phenomenon is the appearance of curvature singularities for the finite
values of the scale factor, but we find that for the positive cosmological
constant these singularities can be avoided. For the positive cosmological
constant the evolution begins at the asymptotic state in the past represented
by the deSitter contracting (deS$_{-}$) spacetime or the static Einstein
universe H=0 or $H=-\infty$ state and reaches the deSitter expanding state

Simultaneous Effelsberg-Urumqi observations demonstrated that the Urumqi

spurious $\sim 24$ hours modulation, an effect which has been removed by means

check for the presence of systematic annual changes in the variability time
scales - a crucial test for verifying the consistency of source-extrinsic

revealed some hint for a slowing down of the characteristic time scales of
S5~0716+714, a result that, if confirmed, would be compatible with a

by means of the Ranz-Marshall equation in which there occurs a mass transfer
coefficient dependent on the plume properties. Our kinetic energy approach is
moreover generalized so as to take into account variable slip velocities.
  The theoretical model is compared with various experiments, and satisfactory
agreement is found. One central ingredient in the model is the turbulent
correlation parameter, called I, playing a role analogous to the conventional
entrainment coefficient \alpha in the more traditional plume theories. We use
experimental data to suggest a relationship between I, the initial gas flux at
the source, and the depth of the gas release. This relationship is used to make
predictions for five distinct case studies.
  Comparison with various experimental data shows that the kinetic energy
approach built upon use of the parameter I in practice has the order of
predictive power as the conventional entrainment-coefficient models. Moreover,
an advantage of the present model is that its predictions are very quickly
worked out numerically.
  Finally, we give a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic energy approach. It
turns out that the model is relatively stable with respect to most of the input
parameters. It is shown that the dissolution is of little influence on the
dynamics of the dispersed phase as long as the dissolution is moderate.

Raman spectroscopy and terahertz time domain spectroscopy are employed to probe
the excitations of the materials. The lattice excitations are found to be
analogous across the compounds over the whole temperature range investigated
(295-4 K). The resulting full phononic characterization of the R2Ti2O7
pyrochlore structure is then used to identify crystal field excitations
observed in the materials. Several crystal field excitations have been observed
in Tb2Ti2O7 in Raman spectroscopy for the first time, among which all of the
previously reported excitations. The presence of additional crystal field
excitations, however, suggests the presence of two inequivalent Tb3+ sites in
the low temperature structure. Furthermore, the crystal field level at
approximately 13 cm-1 is found to be both Raman and dipole active, indicating
broken inversion symmetry in the system and thus undermining its current
symmetry interpretation. In addition, evidence is found for a significant
crystal field-phonon coupling in Tb2Ti2O7. These findings call for a careful
reassessment of the low temperature structure of Tb2Ti2O7, which may serve to
improve its theoretical understanding.

a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and sinks. The mixing enhancement
defined this way is the ratio of the RMS fluctuations of the scalar mixed by
molecular diffusion alone to the (statistically steady-state) RMS fluctuations
of the scalar density in the presence of stirring. This measure of the
effectiveness of the stirring is naturally related to the enhancement factor of
the equivalent eddy diffusivity over molecular diffusion, and depends on the
Peclet number. It was recently noted that the maximum possible mixing
enhancement at a given Peclet number depends as well on the structure of the
sources and sinks. That is, the mixing efficiency, the effective diffusivity,
or the eddy diffusion of a flow generally depends on the sources and sinks of
whatever is being stirred. Here we present the results of particle-based
simulations quantitatively confirming the source-sink dependence of the mixing

distributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. We present a pixelated
approach to modeling simultaneously the lens potential and source intensity of
strong gravitational lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions.
For systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensed
images are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in the
reconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. We apply
this potential reconstruction technique to deep HST observations of B1608+656,
a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lens
galaxies. We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the system that takes
into account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, and
the interacting lens galaxies. Our approach allows us to compare various models
of the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function
(PSF), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lens
potential. Using optimal combinations of the PSF, dust, and lens galaxy light
models, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extended
source-intensity distribution of B1608+656. The resulting reconstruction can be
used as the basis of a measurement of the Hubble constant. We use our
reconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relative
distribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. We find that the
mass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0+/-0.2)h M_{\sun}
L_{B,\sun}^{-1} within the Einstein radius 3.9 h^{-1} kpc, in agreement with
what is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales. (Abridged)

theoretical approach encompassing the physics of neutron stars and heavy

close to the critical value near their surfaces. These configurations may
represent an initial condition for the process of gravitational collapse,

neutrino masses in a supersymmetric five-dimensional model compactified in the

while the gauge and Higgs sectors propagate in the bulk of the fifth dimension.
Supersymmetry is broken by Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions and electroweak
breaking proceeds through radiative corrections. Right-handed neutrinos
propagate in the bulk and have a general five-dimensional mass M, which
localizes the zero modes towards one of the boundaries, and arbitrary boundary
terms. We have found that for generic boundary terms left-handed neutrinos have
Majorana masses. However for specific boundary configurations left-handed
neutrinos are Dirac fermions as the theory possesses a conserved global U(1)
symmetry which prevents violation of lepton number. The size of neutrino masses
depends on the localization of the zero-modes of right-handed neutrinos and/or
the size of the five-dimensional neutrino Yukawa couplings. Left-handed
neutrinos in the sub-eV range require either MR~10 or Yukawa couplings
~10^{-3}R, which make the five-dimensional theory perturbative up to its
