radiation for ground-based detectors. However, the rates of these events are
highly uncertain, given that such systems are invisible. One formation scenario
involves mergers in field binaries, where our lack of complete understanding of
common envelopes and the distribution of supernova kicks has led to rate
estimates that range over a factor of several hundred. A different, and highly
promising, channel involves multiple encounters of binaries in globular
clusters or young star clusters. However, we currently lack solid evidence for
black holes in almost all such clusters, and their low escape speeds raise the
possibility that most are ejected because of supernova recoil. Here we propose
that a robust environment for mergers could be the nuclear star clusters found
in the centers of small galaxies. These clusters have millions of stars, black
hole relaxation times well under a Hubble time, and escape speeds that are
several times those of globulars, hence they retain most of their black holes.
We present simulations of the three-body dynamics of black holes in this
environment and estimate that, if most nuclear star clusters do not have
supermassive black holes that interfere with the mergers, at least several tens
of events per year will be detectable with Advanced LIGO.

full-sky cluster survey based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which
leads to the question of how such a survey would be affected by cosmological
models with a different history of structure formation than LCDM. One class of
these models are early dark energy (EDE) cosmologies, where the dark energy
contribution does not vanish at early times.
  Aims. Since structures grow slower in the presence of EDE, one expects an
increase in the number of galaxy clusters compared to LCDM at intermediate and
high redshifts, which could explain the reported excess of the angular CMB
power spectrum on cluster scales via an enhanced SZ contribution. We study the
impact of EDE on Planck's expected cluster sample.
  Methods. To obtain realistic simulations, we constructed full-sky SZ maps for
EDE and LCDM cosmologies, taking angular cluster correlation into account.
Using these maps, we simulated Planck observations with and without Galactic
foregrounds and fed the results into our filter pipeline based on the spherical
multi-frequency matched filters.
  Results. For the case of EDE cosmologies, we clearly find an increase in the
detected number of clusters compared to the fiducial LCDM case. This shows that
the spherical multi-frequency matched filter is sensitive enough to find
deviations from the LCDM sample, being caused by EDE. In addition we find an
interesting effect of EDE on the completeness of the cluster sample, such that
EDE helps to obtain cleaner samples.

formation, from the collapse of molecular cloud cores to the formation of

physical properties of magnetized plasmas of different degrees of ionization
for a wide range of densities and temperatures. We derive general equations
governing the magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of a three-fluid medium of
arbitrary ionization, also including the possibility of charged dust grains as
the main charge carriers. In a companion paper (Pinto & Galli 2007), we
complement this analysis computing accurate expressions of the collisional
coupling coefficients. Over spatial and temporal scales larger than the
so-called large-scale plasma limit and the collision-dominated plasma limit,
and for non-relativistic fluid speeds, we obtain an advection-diffusion for the
magnetic field. We derive the general expressions for the resistivities, the
diffusion time scales and the heating rates in a three-fluid medium and we use
them to estimate the evolution of the magnetic field in molecular clouds and
protostellar jets. Collisions between charged particles significantly increase
the value of the Ohmic resistivity during the process of cloud collapse,
affecting in particular the decoupling of matter and magnetic field and
enhancing the rate of energy dissipation. The Hall resistivity can take larger
values than previously found when the negative charge is mostly carried by dust
grains. In weakly-or mildy-ionized protostellar jets, ambipolar diffusion is
found to occur on a time scale comparable to the dynamical time scale, limiting
the validity of steady-state and nondissipative models to study the jet's
structure.

and small-amplitude photometric variations on both fast and slow time scales.
The central mystery of Nereid is now to explain the physical mechanism of these
unique brightness changes and why they change with time. To characterize
Nereid's variability, we have been using the SMARTS telescopes on Cerro Tololo
for synoptic monitoring from 1999 to 2006. We present a well-sampled
photometric time series of 493 magnitudes on 246 nights mostly in the V-band.
In combination with our earlier data (for 774 magnitudes over 362 nights), our
20-year data set is the most comprehensive for any small icy body in our Solar
System. Our yearly light curves show that Nereid displays various types of
behaviors: large amplitude brightenings and fadings (1987 to 1990);
moderate-amplitude variation about the average phase curve (1993-1997, 2003,
2005), moderate-amplitude variation and systematically brighter by roughly
one-quarter magnitude throughout the entire season (2004); and nearly constant
light curves superimposed on a surprisingly large-amplitude opposition surge
(1998, 1999, 2000, 2006). Other than in 2004, Nereid's variations were closely
centered around a constant phase curve that is well fit with a Hapke model for
the coherent backscattering opposition surge mechanism with angular scale of
0.7+-0.1 degrees. In our entire data set from 1987-2006, we find no significant
periodicity. We propose that the year-to-year changes in the variability of
Nereid are caused by forced precession (caused by tidal forces from Neptune) on
the spin axis of a nonspherical Nereid, such that cross-sectional areas and
average albedos change as viewed from Earth.

techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by
a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a

on the D3-branes; consequently the field theory must be considered in the
curved background of the 7-branes, and the supergravity background is the fully
backreacted solution accounting for both sets of branes. Although we can not
work in the probe-brane limit, we still find a consistent defect mode-operator
map. In our previous study of the field theory we found chiral D3-brane
zero-modes that localized to the intersection. Here we obtain a dual
supergravity description of the localized R-symmetry anomaly that these
zero-modes produce.

molecular ions, electrons, and charged dust grains, coupled to the local
Galactic magnetic field. Collisions between neutral particles (mostly atomic or
molecular hydrogen) and charged species, and between the charged species
themselves, affect the magnetohydrodynamical behaviour of the medium and the
dissipation of electric currents. The friction force due to elastic collisions
between particles of different species in the multi-component interstellar
plasma is a nonlinear function of the temperature of each species and the Mach
number of the relative drift velocity. The aim of this paper is to provide an
accurate and, as far as possible, complete set of momentum transfer rate
coefficients for magnetohydrodynamical studies of the interstellar medium.
Momentum transfer rates are derived from available experimental data and
theoretical calculations of cross sections within the classic approach
developed by Boltzmann and Langevin for a wide range of values of the
temperature and the drift velocity. Accurate numerical values for momentum
transfer rates are obtained and fitted to simple analytical formulae expressing
the dependence of the results on the gas temperature and the relative drift
velocity. The often used polarization approximation is in satisfactory
agreement with our results only for collisions between H2and molecular ions
(HCO+, H3+). For other kinds of collisions, the polarization approximation
fails by large factors, and must be replaced by more accurate expressions.

of presolar Ti oxide. O-isotopic compositions of the grains span previously
observed ranges and indicate an origin in red giant and asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars of low mass (<2.5 MSun) for most grains. Cool bottom processing in
the parent AGB stars is required to explain isotopic compositions of many
grains. Potassium-41 enrichments in hibonite grains are attributable to in situ
decay of now-extinct 41Ca. Inferred initial 41Ca/40Ca ratios are in good
agreement with model predictions for low-mass AGB star envelopes, provided that
ionization suppresses 41Ca decay. Stable Mg and Ca isotopic ratios of most of
the hibonite grains reflect primarily the initial compositions of the parent
stars and are generally consistent with expectations for Galactic chemical
evolution, but require some local interstellar chemical inhomogeneity. Very
high 17O/16O or 25Mg/24Mg ratios suggest an origin for some grains in binary
star systems where mass transfer from an evolved companion has altered the
parent star compositions. A supernova origin for the hitherto enigmatic
18O-rich Group 4 grains is strongly supported by multi-element isotopic data
for two grains. The Group 4 data are consistent with an origin in a single
supernova in which variable amounts of material from the deep 16O-rich interior
mixed with a unique end-member mixture of the outer layers. The Ti oxide grains
primarily formed in low-mass AGB stars. They are smaller and rarer than
presolar Al2O3, reflecting the lower abundance of Ti than Al in AGB envelopes.

not enjoy are the Weak and Strong Lefschetz Properties and the Maximal Rank
Property (respectively WLP, SLP, and MRP).
  In this paper we will assume that the base field $k$ has characteristic zero.
It is known that SLP implies MRP, which in turn implies WLP, but that both
implications are strict. However, it surprisingly turned out that the set of
Hilbert functions admitting any algebras with WLP coincides with the
corresponding set for SLP (and therefore with that for MRP). J. Migliore and
the first author, using Green's theorem and a result of Wiebe, characterized
the Hilbert functions forcing all algebras to enjoy WLP. The purpose of this
note is to prove the corresponding characterizations for both SLP and MRP.
Unsurprisingly (or surprisingly??), the two characterizations coincide, but
they define a class of Hilbert functions strictly smaller than that determined
for WLP.
  Our methods include the Herzog-Popescu theorem on quotients of $k$-algebras
modulo a general form, a result of Wiebe, and gins and stable ideals. At the
end, we will also discuss the importance of assuming that the characteristic be
zero, and we will exhibit a class of codimension 2 monomial complete
intersections for which SLP (but not MRP) fails in positive characteristic.

reduced with respect to the naive unmagnetized case. The effect appears as soon
as the pressure in the turbulent magnetic field becomes comparable with the

conclude that even in the cases in which turbulent heating may be of some
importance, the dynamical reaction of the field cannot be neglected, as instead

At masses below ~ 10^8.5 Msun, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because
of missing low surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar
mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of
available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this
principal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar
mass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a
faint-end slope, alpha_2 =~ -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the

second we consider co-evolution not only of the individual actions but also of
the memory size, depending on the individual's fitness; and third we assume
strong variability of the environment. We show that changes in the intensity of
the environmental fluctuations introduce a phase transition in the frequency of
cooperators and the diversity of the population. We also find out that extreme
variability of the environment induces changes in the critical exponents and
that this variability can promote more diversity in the population.

distinguishing between supersymmetric theories. In particular we consider 276
pairs of models that give rise to nearly identical patterns of observables at
hadron colliders. Despite inherent uncertainties in such things as the local
halo density model, or background rates from astrophysical sources, we find
observations associated with stable relic neutralinos can be a surprisingly
effective discriminant between candidate theories. We focus attention on
neutralino scattering experiments (direct detection of relic neutralinos) and
observations of gamma-rays from relic neutralino annihilation (indirect
detection experiments). With extremely conservative physics assumptions and
background estimates we find 101 of the 276 degenerate pairs can be
distinguished. Using slightly more optimistic assumptions about background
rates increases this number to 186 of the 276 pairs. In the direct detection
arena the ability to distinguish between models will be dependent on further
progress in addressing uncertainty in nuclear matrix elements. For observations
in the indirect detection arena we discuss the sensitivity of these results to
additional assumptions made about the cosmological density of neutralinos and
the galactic halo profile. We also comment on the complementarity of this study
to recent work investigating these same pairs at a 500 GeV linear collider.

approximation calculations provide a good description of the low-temperature
renormalisation of spin-waves. In contrast, lifetime broadening calculated
using the first Born approximation shows, at best, modest agreement around the
zone boundary at low temperatures. Classical dynamics simulations using an
appropriate quantum-classical correspondence were found to provide a good
description of the intermediate- and high-temperature regimes over all
wave-vector and energy scales, and the crossover from quantum to classical
dynamics observed around $\Theta_{CW}/S$, where the spin S=5/2. A
characterisation of the data over the whole wave-vector/energy/temperature

of Skyrme interactions and relativistic Lagrangians are adopted to study
pairing correlations across a wide range of effective mass. It is shown that
surface-type pairing interaction gives an almost constant pairing gap as a
function of the effective mass, while volume-type pairing interaction shows
rather strong dependence of the pairing gap upon the effective mass. The local
pair potentials of various effective interactions are also examined in relation
to the effective mass.

represented as instanton solitons with isospin and spin quantum numbers locked,
in a manner similar to the Skyrmion model. The soliton picture leads to a
natural effective field theory of arbitrary baryons interacting with mesons.
Couplings of baryons to axial mesons, including pions, are dominated in the
large $N_c$ limit by a direct coupling to the flavor field strength in five
dimensions. We delineate the relevant couplings and determine their strengths.
This work generalizes part of hep-th/0701276 and arXiv:0705.2632 [hep-th] to

interlopers, approximately half are close associations of 2, 3 or 4 galaxies
with one or more interlopers, and the remainder are not physically dense.
Genuine compact groups are preferentially brighter and more isolated than those
with interlopers; by increasing the required minimum surface brightness of a
group from the canonical value of 26mags/arcsec^2 to 22mags/arcsec^2, we can
increase the proportion of genuinely compact systems identified with no
interlopers from 29% to 75%. Of the genuine compact groups identified, more
than half consist of a single dark matter halo with all the member galaxies
deeply embedded within it. In some cases, there are other galaxies which share
the same halo (typically with mass ~ 10^13 h^{-1} M_\odot) but which are not
identified as being members of the compact group. This implies that compact
groups are associated with group environments, some or all members of which are
in the compact group. For those compact groups where all galaxies are in the
same halo, the three-dimensional velocity dispersion of the compact group
correlates broadly with the virial velocity of the dark matter halo. However,
the scale-size of the group - and hence the fraction of the halo mass which the
group samples - is completely uncorrelated with the properties of the dark
matter halo. This means that masses derived under the simple assumption of
virial equilibrium using the observed velocity dispersions and sizes of compact
groups give incorrect estimates of the true mass of the underlying dark matter.

that allows one to take into account that learning within a small model can be
much easier than within a large one. Requiring this ""strong margin adaptivity""
makes the model selection problem more challenging. We first prove, in a
general framework, that some penalization procedures (including local
Rademacher complexities) exhibit this adaptivity when the models are nested.
Contrary to previous results, this holds with penalties that only depend on the
data. Our second main result is that strong margin adaptivity is not always
possible when the models are not nested: for every model selection procedure
(even a randomized one), there is a problem for which it does not demonstrate
strong margin adaptivity.

out on small samples of textile composites, taking into account all individual
fibers of the fabric and interactions taking place between them. The most
delicate issue is related to the modelling of contact-friction interactions
between fibers,and the solution of the nonlinear problem that follows up by the
means of robust algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms, and the
increase of capacities of high performance computing, allow to simulate samples
made of several hundreds of interlocked fibers.

The constant amount of parity is bounded by the lowest-redundancy part of the

available redundancy of the encoded string, and can be on average much higher.
The proposed algorithm thus provides better error protection of encoded data.
  The performance of both algorithms was measured. The comparison showed a

evolution of the transmissions excellently, and the Lyman continuum
transmission also agrees with an observed estimation which is still quite rare
in the literature. The probability distribution of the Lyman $\alpha$ opacity
in our simulation is log-normal with a tail towards a large opacity. This tail
is produced by DLAs. The probability distribution of the Lyman continuum
opacity in our simulation also show a broad tail towards a large opacity. This
tail is produced by LLSs. Because of the rarity of LLSs, we have a chance to
have a clean line of sight in the Lyman continuum even for $z\sim4$ with a
probability of about 20%. Our simulation expects a good correlation between the
Lyman continuum opacity and the Lyman $\alpha$ opacity, which may be useful to
estimate the former from the latter for an individual line of sight.

properties that differ from the general field stars. Thirteen stars with
planets reported in this metallicity range belong to the thick disc, while only
one planet have been detected among stars of the thin disc. Although this
statistics is weak, it contradicts the known correlation between the presence
of planet and metallicity. We relate this finding to the specific property of
the thin disc in this metallicity range, where stars are shown to rotate around
the Galaxy faster than the Sun. Their orbital parameters are conveniently
explained if they are contaminants coming from the outer Galactic disc, as a
result of radial mixing. This must be considered together with the fact that
metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>+0.1 dex) found in the solar neighbourhood, which are
the hosts of most of the detected planets, are suspected of being wanderers
from the inner Galactic disc. It is then questionned why stars that originate
in the inner and outer thin disc show respectively the highest and lowest rate
of detected planets. It is suggested that the presence of giant planets might
be primarily a function of a parameter linked to galactocentric radius, but not
metallicity. Combined with the existing radial metallicity gradient, then
radial mixing explains the correlation at high metallicity observed locally,
but also the peculiarity found at low metallicity, which cannot be accounted
for by a simple correlation between metallicity and planet probability.

are two different ways to adjust a parameter estimate for covariates that may

relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those
relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the
probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a
weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types
of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if
either of the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we show
that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance
of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example
where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods
that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are
sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some estimated
propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple
inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however,
improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the
missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that

asymmetric cosmological models parametrized by the neutrino degeneracy
parameter and the variation of the relativistic degrees of freedom, due to
possible other physical processes occurred between BBN and structure formation
epochs. We find that WMAP5+All data provides strong bounds on helium mass
fraction and neutrino degeneracy parameter that rivals the similar bounds
obtained from the conservative analysis of the present data on helium
abundance. We also find a strong correlation between the matter energy density
and the redshift of matter-radiation equality, z_re, showing that we observe
non-zero equivalent number of relativistic neutrinos mainly via the change of
the of z_re, rather than via neutrino anisotropic stress claimed by the WMAP
team. We forecast that the CMB temperature and polarization measurements
observed with high angular resolutions and sensitivities by the future Planck
satellite will reduce the errors on these parameters down to values fully
consistent with the BBN bounds.

Monte Carlo and quantum Monte Carlo methods. We employ state-of-the-art
implementations using Metropolis, stochastic series expansion and parallel
tempering techniques to obtain the critical ordering temperatures and critical

where we study and contrast the finite-size scaling behavior of ordinary
periodic boundary conditions against annealed boundary conditions. It is shown
that periodic boundary conditions suffer from extreme finite-size effects which
might be caused by closed loop excitations on the torus. These excitations also
appear to have severe effects on the Binder parameter. On this footing we
report on a systematic Monte Carlo study of the quantum compass model. Our
numerical results are at odds with recent literature on the subject which we
trace back to neglecting the strong finite-size effects on periodic lattices.
The critical temperatures are obtained as $T_\mathrm{c}=0.1464(2)J$ and
$T_\mathrm{c}=0.055(1)J$ for the classical and quantum version, respectively,

the half-filled Hubbard model, and the calculations are carried out with the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) together with the numerical renormalization

susceptibility which increases with the field strength. Here, we analyze this
metamagnetic response based on Fermi liquid parameters, which can be calculated
within the DMFT-NRG procedure. The results indicate that the metamagnetic
response can be driven by field-induced effective mass enhancement. However,
also the contribution due to quasiparticle interactions can play a significant

27\arcmin located at the centre of the galaxy. Colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)
of the UMa I dSph shows a steep and narrow red giant branch (RGB), blue and red
horizontal branch (HB), and main sequence (MS) stars. A well-defined main
sequence turn-off (MSTO) is found to be located at V$_{0,MSTO}\sim$23.5 mag.
The distance modulus is derived as $(m-M)_0=19.93\pm0.1$ (corresponding to a
distance D$=96.8\pm4$ kpc) from the V-band magnitude of the horizontal branch
(V$_{0,HB}=20.45\pm0.02$). The mean metallicity of the RGB stars is estimated
by the V$-$I colour to [Fe/H]$\sim-2.0$. The turn-off age estimated by
overlaying the theoretical isochrones reveals that most of stars in the UMa I
dSph are formed at very early epoch ($\sim12$Gyrs ago). The isopleth map of
stellar number density of the UMa I dSph, based upon the resolved star counts
of MS, RGB, HB stars as well as blue stragglers (BS), shows that the morphology
of the UMa I dSph is quite irregular and distorted, suggesting that the galaxy
is in a process of disruption. The very old and metal-poor nature of the
stellar population implies that the star formation history of this newly
discoverd faint dSph may have been different from other well-known `classical'
dSphs, which show significant stellar population of intermediate age. The
stellar population of the UMa I dSph closely resembles that of Galactic old
metal-poor globular cluster, but its size is typical of Galactic dSphs
(r$_{e}$=188 [pc], r$_{1/2}$=300 [pc]), and the shape of its spatial density

similar momentum dependence in the transport decay rate $\Gamma$({\bf k}). In
addition, enhancement of the energy scale (up to the bare bandwidth) over which
spectroscopic information on the quasiparticle response can be obtained has led
to the discovery of new, unforeseen features that surprisingly, may have a

frequently brought into models devoted to coronal heating and fast solar-wind
acceleration. Signatures of ion-cyclotron resonance have already been observed
in situ in the solar wind (HELIOS spacecrafts) and, recently, in the upper
corona (UVCS/SOHO remote-sensing results). We propose a method to constrain
both the Alfven wave amplitude and the preferential heating induced by
ion-cyclotron resonance, above a partially developed polar coronal hole
observed with the SUMER/SOHO spectrometer. The instrumental stray light
contribution is first substracted from the spectra. By supposing that the
non-thermal velocity is related to the Alfven wave amplitude, it is constrained
through a density diagnostic and the gradient of the width of the Mg X 625 A
line. The temperatures of several coronal ions, as functions of the distance
above the limb, are then determined by substracting the non-thermal component
to the observed line widths. The effect of stray light explains the apparent
decrease with height in the width of several spectral lines, this decrease
usually starting about 0.1-0.2 Rs above the limb. This result rules out any
direct evidence of damping of the Alfven waves, often suggested by other
authors. We also find that the ions with the smallest charge-to-mass ratios are
the hottest ones at a fixed altitude and that they are subject to a stronger
heating, as compared to the others, between 57"" and 102"" above the limb. This
constitutes a serious clue to ion-cyclotron preferential heating.

binary erasure channel. Such result is achievable down to low error rates, even
for small and moderate block sizes, while keeping the decoding complexity low,
thanks to a class of decoding algorithms which exploits the sparseness of the
parity-check matrix to reduce the complexity of Gaussian elimination (GE). In
this paper the main concepts underlying ML decoding of LDPC codes are recalled.
A performance analysis among various LDPC code classes is then carried out,
including a comparison with fixed-rate Raptor codes. The results show that LDPC
and Raptor codes provide almost identical performance in terms of decoding
failure probability vs. overhead.

early hunters and gatherers may not have used the words ``method of maximum

it is hard to believe they would have been surprised if their method had been
described in those terms. It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would
rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre
likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple
idea'' is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli,
Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of
those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In
this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time
of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930
characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum
likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three
proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information
inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and
his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation
for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some
lessons drawn.

interpret crossing the horizon of black hole (the zero energy level) as a

play a similar role as the Dirac sea. We successfully recover the gravitational

flux rings are also susceptible to an instability induced by the hydrodynamic
drag force. We investigate the influence of the toroidal shape and equilibrium
condition on the thresholds of the friction-induced instability and on their
relevance for emerging magnetic flux in solar-like stars. Analytical
instability criteria are derived for axial symmetric perturbations and for flux
rings in the equatorial plane by analysing the sequence of principal minors of
the coefficient matrices of dispersion polynomials. The general case of
non-equatorial flux rings is investigated numerically by considering flux tubes
in the solar overshoot region. The friction-induced instability occurs when an
eigenmode reverses its direction of propagation due to advection, typically
from the retrograde to the prograde direction. Since the reversal requires a
certain relative velocity difference between plasma inside the flux tube and
the environment, the instability criterion depends on the location and field
strength of the flux ring. The friction-induced instability sets in at lower
field strengths than buoyancy- and tension-driven instabilities. Its threshold
is independent of the strength of friction, but the growth rates depend on the
strength of the frictional coupling between flux tube and environment. The
friction-induced instability lowers the critical magnetic field strength beyond
which flux tubes are subject to growing perturbations. Whereas buoyancy- and
tension-driven instabilities depend on the magnetic field strength alone, the
dependence of hydrodynamic drag on the tube diameter gives rise to an
additional dependence of growth times on the magnetic flux.

how versions of classical Paley-Wiener theorems can be derived from the real
ones via an approach which does not involve domain shifting and which may be
put to good use for other transforms of Fourier type as well. An explanation is
also given why the easily applied classical Paley-Wiener theorems are unlikely
to be able to yield information about the support of a function or distribution
which is more precise than giving its convex hull, whereas real Paley-Wiener
theorems can be used to reconstruct the support precisely, albeit at the cost
of combinatorial complexity. We indicate a possible application of real
Paley-Wiener theory to partial differential equations in this vein and
furthermore we give evidence that a number of real Paley-Wiener results can be
expected to have an interpretation as local spectral radius formulas. A
comprehensive overview of the literature on real Paley-Wiener theory is

exploit some features of the UPPAAL specification language to attenuate the

concrete model, is very close to the system implementation but runs up against
a severe explosion of states. The second model, called symbolic model, aims to
overcome the limitation of the concrete model by delaying the effective
selection and execution of editing operations until the construction of
symbolic execution traces of all sites is completed. Experimental results have
shown that the symbolic model allows a significant gain in both space and time.
Using the symbolic model, we have been able to show that if the number of sites
exceeds 2 then the convergence property is not satisfied for all OT algorithms
considered here. A counterexample is provided for every algorithm.

connection between classically ordered objects in the thermodynamic limit and
their individual quantum mechanical building blocks is one of the cornerstones
of modern condensed matter theory and has found applications in many different
areas of physics. The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking however, is
inherently an equilibrium theory, which does not address the dynamics of
quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we will use the example of a
particular antiferromagnetic model system to show that the presence of a
so-called thin spectrum of collective excitations with vanishing energy -one of
the well-known characteristic properties shared by all symmetry-breaking
objects- can allow these objects to also spontaneously break time-translation
symmetry in the thermodynamic limit. As a result, that limit is found to be
able, not only to reduce quantum mechanical equilibrium averages to their
classical counterparts, but also to turn individual-state quantum dynamics into
classical physics. In the process, we find that the dynamical description of
spontaneous symmetry breaking can also be used to shed some light on the
possible origins of Born's rule. We conclude by describing an experiment on a
condensate of exciton polaritons which could potentially be used to
experimentally test the proposed mechanism.

neutron star matter using the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The QMC model
describes a nuclear many-body system as nonoverlapping MIT bags in which quarks
interact through the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons in
the mean-field approximation. It is found that the presence of strong magnetic
fields alters the threshold density of antikaon condensation significantly. The
onset of $K^-$ condensation stronger depends on the magnetic field strength,
and it even shifts beyond the threshold of $\bar K^0$ condensation for
sufficiently strong magnetic fields. In the presence of strong magnetic fields,
the equation of state (EOS) becomes stiffer in comparison with the field-free
case. The softening of the EOS by antikaon condensation also depends on the
magnetic field strength, and it becomes less pronounced with increasing
magnetic field strength. The results of the QMC model are compared with those
obtained in a relativistic mean-field (RMF) model, and we find there are
quantitative differences between the results of the QMC and RMF models.

parameterized complexity perspective.Let $M=M(G)$ be the shortest path metric
of an edge weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices. We describe algorithms for
the problem of finding a low distortion non-contracting embedding of $M$ into
line and tree metrics.
  We give an $O(nd^4(2d+1)^{2d})$ time algorithm that for an unweighted graph
metric $M$ and integer $d$ either constructs an embedding of $M$ into the line
with distortion at most $d$, or concludes that no such embedding exists. We
find the result surprising, because the considered problem bears a strong
resemblance to the notoriously hard Bandwidth Minimization problem which does
not admit any FPT algorithm unless an unlikely collapse of parameterized
complexity classes occurs.
  We show that our algorithm can also be applied to construct small distortion
embeddings of weighted graph metrics. The running time of our algorithm is
$O(n(dW)^4(2d+1)^{2dW})$ where $W$ is the largest edge weight of the input
graph. We also show that deciding whether a weighted graph metric $M(G)$ with
maximum weight $W < |V(G)|$ can be embedded into the line with distortion at
most $d$ is NP-Complete for every fixed rational $d \geq 2$. This rules out any
possibility of an algorithm with running time $O((nW)^{h(d)})$ where $h$ is a
function of $d$ alone.
  We generalize the result on embedding into the line by proving that for any
tree $T$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, embedding of $M$ into a shortest path
metric of $T$ is FPT, parameterized by $(\Delta,d)$.

the mass of its progenitor in the main-sequence. Although this function is of
fundamental importance to several fields in modern astrophysics, it is not well
constrained either from the theoretical or the observational points of view. In
this work we revise the present semi-empirical initial-final mass relationship
by re-evaluating the available data. The distribution obtained from grouping
all our results presents a considerable dispersion, which is larger than the
uncertainties. We have carried out a weighted least-squares linear fit of these
data and a careful analysis to give some clues on the dependence of this
relationship on some parameters such as metallicity or rotation. The
semi-empirical initial-final mass relationship arising from our study covers
the range of initial masses from 1.0 to 6.5 M_sun, including in this way the
low-mass domain, poorly studied until recently. Finally, we have also performed
a test of the initial-final mass relationship by studying its effect on the
luminosity function and on the mass distribution of white dwarfs. This was done
by using different initial-final mass relationships from the literature,
including the expression derived in this work, and comparing the results
obtained with the observational data from the Palomar Green Survey and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the semi-empirical initial-final

is studied by analyzing its Dyson-Schwinger equation. Building on previously
obtained results for Green functions in the Yang-Mills sector we analytically
derive the existence of power-law infrared singularities for this vertex. We
establish that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking leads to the self-consistent
generation of components of the quark-gluon vertex forbidden when chiral
symmetry is forced to stay in the Wigner-Weyl mode. In the latter case the
running strong coupling assumes an infrared fixed point. If chiral symmetry is
broken, either dynamically or explicitely, the running coupling is infrared
divergent. Based on a truncation for the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger
equation which respects the analytically determined infrared behavior numerical
results for the coupled system of the quark propagator and vertex
Dyson-Schwinger equation are presented. The resulting quark mass function as
well as the vertex function show only a very weak dependence on the current
quark mass in the deep infrared. From this we infer by an analysis of the
quark-quark scattering kernel a linearly rising quark potential with an almost
mass independent string tension in the case of broken chiral symmetry.
Enforcing chiral symmetry does lead to a Coulomb type potential. Therefore we
conclude that chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are closely related.
Furthermore we discuss aspects of confinement as the absence of long-range
van-der-Waals forces and Casimir scaling. An examination of experimental data
for quarkonia provides further evidence for the viability of the presented
mechanism for quark confinement in the Landau gauge.

interest in third-order correlation statistics. Measures of third-order
clustering are sensitive to the structure of filaments and voids in the
universe and are useful for studying large-scale structure. Thus, statistics of
these third-order measures can be used to test and constrain parameters in
cosmological models. Third-order measures such as the three-point correlation
function are now commonly estimated for galaxy surveys. Studies of third-order
clustering of absorption systems will complement these analyses. We define a
statistic, which we denote K, that measures third-order clustering of a data
set of point observations and focus on estimating this statistic for an
absorber catalog. The statistic K can be considered a third-order version of
the second-order Ripley K-function and allows one to study the abundance of
various configurations of point triplets. In particular, configurations
consisting of point triplets that lie close to a straight line can be examined.
Studying third-order clustering of absorbers requires consideration of the
absorbers as a three-dimensional process, observed on QSO lines of sight that
extend radially in three-dimensional space from Earth. Since most of this
three-dimensional space is not probed by the lines of sight, edge corrections
become important. We use an analytical form of edge correction weights and
construct an estimator of the statistic K for use with an absorber catalog. We
show that with these weights, ratio-unbiased estimates of K can be obtained.
Results from a simulation study also verify unbiasedness and provide
information on the decrease of standard errors with increasing number of lines
of sight.

particles with a parabolic interaction potential. In our model the nucleons are
made up from these particles. We find the retarded dispersion force between
