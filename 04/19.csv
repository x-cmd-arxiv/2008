an aqueous ionic solution close to an interface with a model metallic electrode
are described. In the simulations the electrode behaves as an ideally
polarizable hydrophilic metal, supporting image charge interactions with
charged species, and it is maintained at a constant electrical potential with
respect to the solution so that the model is a textbook representation of an
electrochemical interface through which no current is passing. We show how
water is strongly attracted to and ordered at the electrode surface. This
ordering is different to the structure that might be imagined from continuum
models of electrode interfaces. Further, this ordering significantly affects
the probability of ions reaching the surface. We describe the concomitant
motion and configurations of the water and ions as functions of the electrode
potential, and we analyze the length scales over which ionic atmospheres
fluctuate. The statistics of these fluctuations depend upon surface structure
and ionic strength. The fluctuations are large, sufficiently so that the mean
ionic atmosphere is a poor descriptor of the aqueous environment near a metal
surface. The importance of this finding for a description of electrochemical
reactions is examined by calculating, directly from the simulation, Marcus free
energy profiles for transfer of charge between the electrode and a redox
species in the solution and comparing the results with the predictions of
continuum theories. Significant departures from the electrochemical textbook
descriptions of the phenomenon are found and their physical origins are
characterized from the atomistic perspective of the simulations.

For example,
the timelessness of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be seen as resulting from
using Jacobi's principle to define the dynamics of 3-geometries through
superspace. In addition, using Jacobi's principle for non-relativistic
particles is equivalent classically to Newton's theory but leads to a
time-independent Schrodinger equation upon Dirac quantization. In this paper,
we study the mechanism for the disappearance of time as a result of using
Jacobi's principle in these simple particle models. We find that the path
integral quantization very clearly elucidates the physical mechanism for the
timeless of the quantum theory as well as the emergence of duration at the
classical level. Physically, this is the result of a superposition of clocks
which occurs in the quantum theory due to a sum over all histories.
Mathematically, the timelessness is related to how the gauge fixing functions
impose the boundary conditions in the path integral.

ferromagnetic platelets of micron and sub-micron size and is characterised by
an in-plane curling magnetisation. At the centre, a magnetic singularity is
avoided by an out-of-plane magnetisation core. This core has a gyrotropic
excitation mode, which corresponds to a circular motion of the vortex around
its equilibrium position, where the rotation sense is determined by the
direction of the vortex core magnetisation, its polarisation. Unlike linear
fields or spin polarised currents, which excite both polarisation states, an
in-plane rotating field can selectively excite one of the polarisation states.
Here we report the observation of vortex dynamics in response to rotating
magnetic fields, imaged with time-resolved scanning X-ray microscopy. We
demonstrate that the rotating field only excites the gyrotropic mode if the
rotation sense of the field coincides with the vortex gyration sense and that
such a field can selectively reverse the vortex polarisation.

improved and extended this argument to set upper limits on the expected
amplitude from neutron stars that also emit electromagnetic radiation. We
restate these arguments in a more general framework, and simulate the evolution

simulations allow us to test the assumptions of Blandford's argument on a

frequency distribution) are in general not fulfilled. The effective scaling
dimension D of the spatial distribution of neutron stars is significantly
larger than two, and for frequencies detectable by terrestrial instruments the
frequency distribution is not in a steady state unless the ellipticity is
unrealistically large. Thus, in the cases of most interest, the maximum
expected gravitational-wave amplitude does have a strong dependence on the
deformation and rotation frequency of the population. The results strengthen
the previous upper limits on the expected gravitational-wave amplitude from
neutron stars by a factor of 6 for realistic values of ellipticity.

has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are
sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum
Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in
the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial
scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We
also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of
suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator
precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA.
Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit
for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence
on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect
of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum

for this reason the mass-metallicity relation evolves little with redshift.
However, for galaxies with present stellar masses < 10^{10} Msun, the evolution
is significant, with metallicity increasing by more than a decade from redshift
3 to the present. By being able to recover the metallicity history, we have
managed to identify the origin of a recent discrepancy between the metallicity
recovered from nebular lines and absorption lines. As expected, we show that
the young population dominates the former while the old population the latter.
We have investigated the dependence on the stellar models used and find that
older stellar population synthesis codes do not produce a clear result.

large variations in D/H along different lines of sight. Moreover, recent {\it

anticorrelated with several indicators of dust formation and survival,
suggesting that interstellar deuterium suffers significant depletion onto dust
grains. This in turn implies that the total deuterium abundance in the local
Galactic disk could be as high as $\sim 84 %$ of the primordial D abundance. It
was proposed that the infall/accretion of pristine gas is needed to explain
such a high deuterium abundance. However, we point out that the infall needed
to maintain a high present-day D/H is, within the preferred models, in tension
with observations that gas represents only some $\sim 20%$ of Galactic baryons,
with the balance in stars. We study this tension in the context of a wide class
of Galactic evolution models for baryonic processing through stars, which show
that deuterium destruction is strongly and cleanly correlated with the drop in
the gas fraction. We find that FUSE deuterium observations and Galactic gas
fraction estimates can be reconciled in some models; these demand a significant
infall rate of pristine material that almost completely balances the rate of
star formation. These successful models also require that the average fraction
of gas that is returned by dying stars is less than 40% of the initial stellar
mass. Cosmological implications of dust depletion of D in high-redshift systems

restriction to 2 dimensions (axisymmetry) in previous analytical and numerical

area is the nature and origin of the strong, preferably highly ordered magnetic
fields known to work best for jet production. The observational evidence for
such fields and their behavior in numerical simulations is discussed. I argue

instrumentation (SOHO, TRACE and Hinode) may consist of many sub-resolution
elements or strands. Thus, the overall plasma evolution we observe in these
features could be the cumulative result of numerous individual strands
undergoing sporadic heating. This paper presents a short (10^9 cm ~ 10 Mm)
``global loop'' as 125 individual strands where each strand is modelled
independently by a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation. The energy release
mechanism across the strands consists of localised, discrete heating events
(nano-flares). The strands are ``coupled'' together through the frequency
distribution of the total energy input to the loop which follows a power law
distribution with index alpha. The location and lifetime of each energy event
occurring is random. Although a typical strand can go through a series of
well-defined heating/cooling cycles, when the strands are combined, the overall
quasi-static emission measure weighted thermal profile for the global loop
reproduces a hot apex/cool base structure. Localised cool plasma blobs are seen
to travel along individual strands which could cause the loop to `disappear'
from coronal emission and appear in transition or chromospheric ones. As alpha
increases (from 0 to 2.29 to 3.29), more weight is given to the smallest
heating episodes. Consequently, the overall global loop apex temperature
increases while the variation of the temperature around that value decreases.
Any further increase in alpha saturates the loop apex temperature variations at
the current simulation resolution. The effect of increasing the number of
strands and the loop length as well as the implications of these results upon
possible future observing campaigns for TRACE and Hinode are discussed.

the tight correlation of the intensity distribution with the molecular gas
indicates a pionic-decay process involving relativistic protons. In this paper,
we explore the possible source(s) of energetic hadrons at the galactic centre,
and their propagation through a turbulent medium. We conclude that though
Sagittarius A* itself may be the source of cosmic rays producing the emission

rule out any static magnetic order above 1.6 K in these superconducting

temperature and field dependence of the superfluid density. Whereas the
temperature dependence is consistent with a weak coupling BCS s-wave or a dirty
d-wave gap function scenario, the field dependence strongly evidences
unconventional superconductivity. We obtain the in-plane penetration depth of
\lambda_{ab} (0) = 254(2)nm for LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs and \lambda_{ab} (0) =
364(8)nm for LaO_{0.925}F_{0.075}FeAs. Further evidence for unconventional
superconductivity is provided by the ratio of T_c versus the superfluid
density, which is close to the Uemura line of hole doped high-T_c cuprates.

influence, and impact factors are routinely used in making decisions ranging
from selecting journal subscriptions to allocating research funding to deciding
tenure cases. Yet journal impact factors have increased gradually over time,
and moreover impact factors vary widely across academic disciplines. Here we
quantify inflation over time and differences across fields in impact factor
scores and determine the sources of these differences. We find that the average
number of citations in reference lists has increased gradually, and this is the
predominant factor responsible for the inflation of impact factor scores over
time. Field-specific variation in the fraction of citations to literature
indexed by Thomson Scientific's Journal Citation Reports is the single greatest
contributor to differences among the impact factors of journals in different
fields. The growth rate of the scientific literature as a whole, and
cross-field differences in net size and growth rate of individual fields, have
had very little influence on impact factor inflation or on cross-field
differences in impact factor.

low-metallicity star of the old galactic disk. A 5-night asteroseismic
observation program has been conducted in August 2006 with Harps. Spectra were
reduced with the on-line data reduction software provided by the instrument. A
new statistical approach has been developed for extracting the significant
peaks in the Fourier domain. The oscillation spectrum shows a significant
excess power in the frequency range [1.5, 3.0 mHz]. It exhibits a large spacing
about 120.4 $\mu$Hz at 2.5 mHz. Variations of the large spacing with frequency
are clearly identified, which require an adapted asymptotic development. The
modes identification is based on the unambiguous signature of 15 modes with
$\ell = 0$ and 1. This observation shows the potential diagnostic of
asteroseismic constraints. Including them in the stellar modeling enhances
significantly the precision on the physical parameters of \cible, resulting in
a much more precise position in the HR diagram. The age of the star is now
determined in the range $7.25\pm0.07$ Gyr.

of noncommutative U(1) gauge theory for the three cases: a) space-time
noncommutativity, b) space-space noncommutativity and c) both a) and b). The
solutions tend to the Coulumb solution at spatial infinity and are valid for
intermediate values of the radial coordinate $r$. They yield a self-charge in a
sphere of radius $r$ centered about the origin which increases with decreasing
$r$ for case a), and decreases with decreasing $r$ for case b). For case a)
this may mean that the exact solution screens an infinite charge at the origin,
while for case b) it is plausible that the charge density is well behaved at
the origin, as happens in Born-Infeld electrodynamics. For both cases a) and b)
the self-energy in the intermediate region grows faster as $r$ tends to the
origin than that of the Coulumb solution. It then appears that the divergence
of the classical self-energy is more severe in the noncommutative theory than
it is in the corresponding commutative theory. We compute the lowest order
effects of these solutions on the hydrogen atom spectrum and use them to put
experimental bounds on the space-time and space-space noncommutative scales. We

spectrum of the Crab pulsar (Hankins T. H. & Eilek J. A., 2007, ApJ, 670, 693)
fit the oscillations of the square of a Bessel function whose argument exceeds
its order. This function has already been encountered in the analysis of the
emission from a polarization current with a superluminal distribution pattern:
a current whose distribution pattern rotates (with an angular frequency
$\omega$) and oscillates (with a frequency $\Omega>\omega$ differing from an
integral multiple of $\omega$) at the same time (Ardavan H., Ardavan A. &
Singleton J., 2003, J Opt Soc Am A, 20, 2137). Using the results of our earlier
analysis, we find that the dependence on frequency of the spacing and width of
the observed emission bands can be quantitatively accounted for by an
appropriate choice of the value of the single free parameter $\Omega/\omega$.
In addition, the value of this parameter, thus implied by Hankins & Eilek's
data, places the last peak in the amplitude of the oscillating Bessel function
in question at a frequency ($\sim\Omega^3/\omega^2$) that agrees with the
position of the observed ultraviolet peak in the spectrum of the Crab pulsar.
We also show how the suppression of the emission bands by the interference of
the contributions from differring polarizations can account for the differences
in the time and frequency signatures of the interpulse and the main pulse in
the Crab pulsar. Finally, we put the emission bands in the context of the
observed continuum spectrum of the Crab pulsar by fitting this broadband
spectrum (over 16 orders of magnitude of frequency) with that generated by an
electric current with a superluminally rotating distribution pattern.

takes a few days for full development of superhumps. The superhump period
variation diagram of FL TrA was similar to that observed in some WZ Sge stars

related to WZ Sge stars and SU UMa stars having short orbital periods. For CTCV
J0549-4921, the candidates of the mean superhump period are 0.083249(10) days

58 ones from ELODIE + 17 ones from CORALIE) for the star HD37124 is analysed.
Two families of dynamically stable high-eccentricity orbital solutions for the
planetary system are found. In the first one, the outer planets c and d are
trapped in the 2/1 mean-motion resonance. The second family of solutions
corresponds to the 5/2 mean-motion resonance between these planets. In both
families, the planets are locked in (or close to) an apsidal corotation
resonance. In the case of the 2/1 MMR, it is an asymmetric apsidal corotation
(with the difference between the longitudes of periastra $\Delta\omega\sim
60^\circ$), whereas in the case of the 5/2 MMR it is a symmetric antialigned
one ($\Delta\omega = 180^\circ$).
  It remains also possible that the two outer planets are not trapped in an
orbital resonance. Then their orbital eccentricities should be relatively small
(less than, say, 0.15) and the ratio of their orbital periods is unlikely to
exceed $2.3-2.5$.

sheath. Most applications deal with the jet breakup, leading to either of two
droplet generation regimes: jetting and dripping. The cone-jet flow pattern is
explored by direct axisymmetric VOF numerical simulation; its evolution is
studied as the liquid flow-rate is increased around the jetting-dripping
transition. As observed in other focused flows such as electrospraying cones
upon steady thread emission, the flow displays a strong recirculating pattern
within the conical meniscus; it is shown to play a role on the stability of the
system, being a precursor to the onset of dripping. Close to the minimum liquid
flow rate for steady jetting, the recirculation cell penetrates into the feed
tube. Both the jet diameter and the size of the cell are accurately estimated
by a simple theoretical model. In addition, the transition from jetting to
dripping is numerically analyzed in detail in some illustrative cases, and
compared, to good agreement, with a set of experiments.

white dwarf WD 1953-011. Circular polarization and intensity spectra of the
H$\alpha$ spectral line demonstrate the presence of two-component magnetic
field in the photosphere of this star. The geometry consists of a weak, large
scale component, and a strong, localized component. Analyzing the rotationally
modulated low-field component, we establish a rotation period $P_{rot} = 1.4480
\pm 0.0001$ days. Modeling the measured magnetic observables, we find that the
low-field component can be described by the superposition of a dipole and
quadrupole. According to the best-fit model, the inclination of the stellar
rotation axis with respect to the line of sight is $i \approx 20^\circ$, and
the angle between the rotation axis and the dipolar axis is $\beta \approx
10^\circ$. The dipole strength at the pole is about 180 kG, and the quadrupolar
strength is about 230 kG. These data suggest a fossil origin of the low-field
component. In contrast, the strong-field component exhibits a peculiar,
localized structure (``magnetic spot'') that confirms the conclusions of Maxted
and co-workers. The mean field modulus of the spot ($|B_{spot}| = 520 \pm 7$
kG) together with its variable longitudinal magnetic field having a maximum of
about +400 kG make it difficult to describe it naturally as a high-order
component of the star's global poloidal field. Instead, we suggest that the
observed strong-field region has a geometry similar to a magnetic flux tube.

temperatures Tvir > 10^4 K begins to cool and condense via atomic hydrogen.
Provided this gas is irradiated by a strong ultraviolet (UV) flux and remains
free of H2 and other molecules, it has been proposed that the halo with Tvir
~10^4 K may avoid fragmentation, and lead to the rapid formation of a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) as massive as M=10^5-10^6 Msun. This
``head--start'' would help explain the presence of SMBHs with inferred masses
of several x 10^9 Msun, powering the bright quasars discovered in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey at redshift z>~6. However, high-redshift DM halos with
Tvir~10^4K are likely already enriched with at least trace amounts of metals
and dust produced by prior star-formation in their progenitors. Here we study
the thermal and chemical evolution of low-metallicity gas exposed to extremely
strong UV radiation fields. Our results, obtained in one-zone models, suggest
that gas fragmentation is inevitable above a critical metallicity, whose value
is between Zcr~3x10^{-4} Zsun (in the absence of dust) and as low as Zcr~ 5 x
10^{-6} Zsun (with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of about 0.01 Z/Zsun). We propose
that when the metallicity exceeds these critical values, dense clusters of
low--mass stars may form at the halo nucleus. Relatively massive stars in such
a cluster can then rapidly coalesce into a single more massive object, which
may produce an intermediate-mass BH remnant with a mass up to M <~10^2-10^3
Msun.

theories fail disastrously when describing the dis-sociative symmetric radical
cations R2+. Considering this dissociation limit, previous work has shown that
Hartree-Fock (HF) theory favors the R+1--R0 charge distribution while DF
approximations favor the R+0.5 -- R+0.5. Yet, general quantum mechanical
principles indicate that both these (as well as all intermediate) average
charge distributions are asymptotically energy degenerate. Thus HF and ADF
theories mistakenly break the symmetry but in a contradicting way. In this
letter we show how to construct system-dependent long-range corrected (LC)
density functionals that can successfully treat this class of molecules,
avoiding the spurious symmetry breaking. Examples and comparisons to
experimental data is given for R=H, He and Ne and it is shown that the new LC
theory improves considerably the theoretical description of the R2+ bond
properties, the long range form of the asymptotic potential curve as well as
the atomic polarizability. The broader impact of this finding is discussed as
well and it is argued that the widespread semi-empirical approach which
advocates treating the LC parameter as a system-independent parameter is in
fact inappropriate under general circumstances.
