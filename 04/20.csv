identical fibers can be distributed either in a stable symmetric state at
strong coupling or in a stable asymmetric state if the coupling is small
enough. In the first case, if the initial state is not the equilibrium state,
the intensity may switch periodically from fiber to fiber, while in the second
case the a-symmetrical state remains forever, with most of its energy in either
fiber. The latter situation makes a state of propagation with two exactly
reciprocal realizations. In the quantum case, such a situation does not exist
as an eigenstate because of the quantum tunneling between the two fibers. Such
a tunneling is a purely quantum phenomenon which does not not exist in the
classical theory. We estimate the rate of tunneling by quantizing a simplified
dynamics derived from the original Lagrangian equations with test functions.
This tunneling could be within reach of the experiments, particularly if the
quantum coherence of the soliton can be maintained over a sufficient amount of
time.

spacetimes, a gravitational system whose classical solutions describe
homogeneous anisotropic cosmologies. We rigorously construct the operator that
represents the Hamiltonian constraint, showing that the states of zero volume
completely decouple from the rest of quantum states. This fact ensures that the
classical cosmological singularity is resolved in the quantum theory. In
addition, this allows us to adopt an equivalent quantum description in terms of
a well defined densitized Hamiltonian constraint. This latter constraint can be
regarded in a certain sense as a difference evolution equation in an internal
time provided by one of the triad components, which is polymerically quantized.
Generically, this evolution equation is a relation between the projection of
the quantum states in three different sections of constant internal time.
Nevertheless, around the initial singularity the equation involves only the two
closest sections with the same orientation of the triad. This has a double
effect: on the one hand, physical states are determined just by the data on one
section, on the other hand, the evolution defined in this way never crosses the
singularity, without the need of any special boundary condition. Finally, we
provide these physical states with a Hilbert structure, completing the
quantization.

ANOVA models with nested effects. I show that the best linear unbiased

effective sample size is introduced for parameters that are inconsistently

design is desirable; adding more sampling units may not help ancestral
reconstruction and only strong lineage effects may be detected with high power.

between lattice work on QCD with light dynamical quarks, effective field theory
and low energy precision experiments. Then I discuss how dispersion theory can
be used to analyze the low energy structure of the $\pi\pi$ scattering
amplitude in a model independent manner. This leads to an exact formula for the
mass and width of the lowest few resonances, in terms of observable quantities.
As an application, I consider the pole position of the $\sigma$, paying
particular to error propagation in the numerical analysis. The report is based
on work done in collaboration with Irinel Caprini and Gilberto Colangelo.

  Perturbative Confinement",,,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of a four dimensional generally covariant modified SU(N)
Yang-Mills action, which depends on the complex structure of spacetime and not
its metric, is studied. A general solution of the complex structure
integrability conditions is found in the context of the G{2,2) Grassmannian
manifold, which admits a global SL(4,C) symmetry group. A convenient definition
of the physical energy and momentum permits the study of the vacuum and soliton
sectors. The model has a set of conformally SU(2,2) invariant vacua and a set
of Poincare invariant vacua. An algebraic integrability condition of the
complex structure classifies the solitonic surfaces into three classes
(families). The first class (spacetimes with two principal null directions)
contains the Kerr-Newman complex structure, which has fermionic (electron-like)
properties. That is the correct fermionic gyromagnetic ratio (g=2) and it
satisfies the correct electron equations of motion. The conjugate complex
structure determines the antisoliton, which has the same mass and opposite
charge. The fermionic solitons are differentiated from the complex structure
bosonic modes by the periodicity condition on compactified spacetime. The
non-periodicity of the found solitonic complex structures is proved. The
modification of the Yang-Mills action has an essential consequence to the
classical potential. It generates a linear static potential instead of the
Coulomb-like (1/r) potential of the ordinary Yang-Mills action. This linear
potential implies that for every pure geometric soliton there are N solitonic
gauge field excitations, which are perturbatively confined. The present model
advocates a solitonic unification scheme without supersymmetry and/or
superstrings.

upper half plane which are bi-invariant under the action of a congruence
subgroup, have logarithmic singularity along the diagonal, but instead of the
usual equation $\Delta f=0$ we have equation $\Delta f = k(1-k) f$. Here $k$ is
a positive integer. Properties of these functions are related to the space of
modular forms of weight $2k$. In the case when there are no cusp forms of
weight $2k$ it was conjectured that the values of the Green function at points
of complex multiplication are algebraic multiples of logarithms of algebraic
numbers. We show that this conjecture can be proved in any particular case if
one constructs a family of elements of certain higher Chow groups on the power
of a family of elliptic curves. These families have to satisfy certain
properties. A different family of elements of Higher Chow groups is needed for
a different point of complex multiplication. We give an example of such
families, thereby proving the conjecture for the case when the group is
$PSL_2(\mathbf Z)$, $k=2$ and one of the arguments is $\sqrt{-1}$.

epidemic propagation, in the paper we present that disease spreading is
inhibited in fractal scale-free networks. We first propose a novel network
model and show that it simultaneously has the following rich topological
properties: scale-free degree distribution, tunable clustering coefficient,
""large-world"" behavior, and fractal scaling. Existing network models do not
display these characteristics. Then, we investigate the
susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model of the propagation of diseases in our
fractal scale-free networks by mapping it to bond percolation process. We find
an existence of nonzero tunable epidemic thresholds by making use of the
renormalization group technique, which implies that power-law degree
distribution does not suffice to characterize the epidemic dynamics on top of
scale-free networks. We argue that the epidemic dynamics are determined by the
topological properties, especially the fractality and its accompanying
""large-world"" behavior.

blocking of superparamagnetic particles through the T^(-3) dependence of the
third harmonic at higher temperatures. Below T_N a nondiverging peak appears,
which is strongly affected by the addition of 10% of Cu ions in the RuO2

accompanied by two characteristic temperatures in the third harmonic of the ac

potentials are found from the device structure and a few adjustable parameters.
Numerically stable calculation procedures for the interaction potential are
detailed and procedures for deriving parameter values from experimental

1960's (though its roots stretch far back into the 19th century) by S. Smale,
his students and collaborators, in the west, and D. Anosov, Ya. Sinai, V.
Arnold, in the former Soviet Union. It came to encompass a detailed description
of a large class of systems, often with very complex evolution. Moreover, it
provided a very precise characterization of structurally stable dynamics, which
was one of its original main goals. The early developments were motivated by
the problem of characterizing structural stability of dynamical systems, a
notion that had been introduced in the 1930's by A. Andronov and L. Pontryagin.
Inspired by the pioneering work of M. Peixoto on circle maps and surface flows,
Smale introduced a class of gradient-like systems, having a finite number of
periodic orbits, which should be structurally stable and, moreover, should
constitute the majority (an open and dense subset) of all dynamical systems.
Stability and openness were eventually established, in the thesis of J. Palis.
However, contemporary results of M. Levinson, based on previous work by M.
Cartwright and J. Littlewood, provided examples of open subsets of dynamical
systems all of which have an infinite number of periodic orbits.
