that the transmission density evolves rapidly into the density in the diffusive

Therefore, the transmission density distribution for a few $N_c$ channels comes
close to the known bimodal density distribution in the metallic limit. This is

plasma approximately distributed in a thin disk of circular shape, usually with
a central bulge. The rotation velocities quickly increase from the galactic
center and then achieve a constant velocity from the core to the periphery. The
basic dynamic behavior of a mature spiral galaxy, such as the Milky Way, is
well described by simple models balancing Newtonian gravitational forces
against the centrifugal forces associated with a rotating thin axisymmetric
disk. In this research, we investigate the effects of adding central bulges to
thin disk gravitational models. Even with the addition of substantial central
bulges, all the critical essential features of our thin disk gravitational
models are preserved. (1) Balancing Newtonian gravitational and centrifugal
forces at every point within the disk yields computed radial mass distributions
that describe the measured rotation velocity profiles of mature spiral galaxies
successfully. (2) There is no need for gravity deviations or ``massive
peripheral spherical halos of mysterious Dark Matter''. (3) The calculated
total galactic masses are in good agreement with star count data. (4) The
addition of central bulges increases the calculated total galactic masses,
possibly more consistent with the presence of galactic gases, dust, grains,
lumps, planets and plasma in addition to stars. (5) Compared with the light
distribution, our mass distributions within the disk are larger out toward the
galactic periphery which is cooler with lower opactiy/emissivity (and thus
darker). This is apparent from edge-on views of galaxies which display a dark
disk-line against a much brighter galactic halo.

based on the picture of effective sites, coupled in a self-consistent fashion,
have proven very useful. Particularly in the presence of strong local
correlations, a local approach to the problem, combining a powerful method for
the short ranged interactions with the lattice propagation part of the
dynamics, determines the quality of results to a large extent. For a
considerable time the non crossing approximation (NCA) in direct perturbation
theory, an approach originally developed by Keiter for the Anderson impurity
model, built a standard for the description of the local dynamics of
interacting electrons. In the last couple of years exact methods like the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) as pioneered by Wilson, have surpassed
this approximation as regarding the description of the low energy regime. We
present an improved approximation level of direct perturbation theory for
finite Coulomb repulsion U, the crossing approximation one (CA1) and discuss
its connections with other generalizations of NCA. CA1 incorporates all
processes up to fourth order in the hybridization strength V in a
self-consistent skeleton expansion, retaining the full energy dependence of the
vertex functions. We reconstruct the local approach to the lattice problem from
the point of view of cumulant perturbation theory in a very general way and
discuss the proper use of impurity solvers for this purpose. Their reliability
can be tested in applications to e.g. the Hubbard model and the
Anderson-lattice model. We point out shortcomings of existing impurity solvers

mechanics arising naturally from the fundamental principles of the Born
probability rule, superposition, and spacetime translation invariance. The
resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for a number of previous
parameterized approaches to relativistic quantum mechanics in the literature.
Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates, rather than
as an evolution parameter, such approaches have proved particularly useful in
the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. The present paper extends the
foundational spacetime path formalism to include massive, nonscalar particles
of any (integer or half-integer) spin. This is done by generalizing the
principle of translational invariance used in the scalar case to the principle
of full Poincare invariance, leading to a formulation for the nonscalar
propagator in terms of a path integral over the Poincare group. Once the
difficulty of the non-compactness of the component Lorentz group is dealt with,
the subsequent development is remarkably parallel to the scalar case. This
allows the formalism to retain a clear probabilistic interpretation throughout,
with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum mechanics closely related
to the well known generalized Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

practical difficulties. The strong interactions found their theoretical
foundation elsewhere, namely on QCD, the quantum gauge field theory of quarks
and gluons. Recently, the Gauge/Gravity correspondence allowed to initiate a
reformulation of the connection between strings and gauge field theories,
avoiding some of the initial drawbacks and opening the way to new insights on
the gauge theory at strong coupling and eventually QCD. Among others, the
recent applications of the Gauge/Gravity correspondence to the formation of the
QGP, the quark-gluon plasma, in heavy-ion reactions seem to provide a
physically interesting insight on phenomenological features of the reactions.

analyze the maximum achievable long-run average packet throughput, which we

WDM rings. We identify three segments that can experience the maximum
utilization, and thus, limit the multicast capacity. We characterize the
segment utilization probabilities through bounds and approximations, which we
verify through simulations. We discover that shortest-path routing can lead to
utilization probabilities above one half for moderate to large portions of
hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic, and consequently multicast
capacities of less than two simultaneous packet transmissions. We outline a
one-copy routing strategy that guarantees a multicast capacity of at least two
simultaneous packet transmissions for arbitrary hotspot source traffic.

photometrically using observations from all three instruments on the Spitzer
Space Telescope. The global SED of M101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonly
called PAH feature) emission. The spatially resolved spectral and photometric
measurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations with
significantly weaker emission at larger radii. We compare these variations with
changes in the ionization index (as measured by [NeIII]/[NeII] and [SIV/SIII],
which we probe over the ranges 0.03-20 and 0.044-15 respectively) and
metallicity (expressed as log(O/H)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8). Over
these ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from
7 HII regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionization
index than with metallicity. This implies that the weakening of the aromatic
emission in massive star forming regions is due primarily to processing of the
dust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form
(although formation could still be important on a secondary basis). The
behavior of the correlation between the aromatic feature equivalent widths and
ionization index can be described as a constant equivalent width until a
threshold in ionization index is reached ([NeIII]/[NeII] ~ 1), above which the
equivalent widths decrease with a power law dependence. This behavior for M101
HII regions is also seen for the sample of starburst galaxies presented in the
companion study of Engelbracht et al. (2008) which expands the range of
[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios to 0.03-25 and log(O/H)+12 values to 7.1-8.8. The form of
the correlation explains seemingly contradictory results present in the

2D images of 3D neurons (e.g. camera lucida images and other types of 2D
microscopy). Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to
characterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The
proposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following
even in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed
in order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as
well as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for
each subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of
branches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction
to proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to
yield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported
system was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results
from a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a
different class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a
total of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these
overlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images
with close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be
implemented in an efficient manner. The introduction of this approach should
pave the way for more systematic application of contour-based shape analysis
methods in neuronal morphology.

one of dark matter at the freeze-out era allows us to constraint the parameter
space in mSUGRA models. Moreover, joining these constraints with the ones
obtained from the usual abundance criteria and demanding both criteria to be
consistent with the 2$\sigma$ bounds for the abundance of dark matter:
$0.112\leq\Omega_{DM}h^2\leq0.122$, we are able to clearly discriminate
validity regions among the values of $\tan \beta$, one of the parameters of the
mSUGRA model. We found that for the explored regions of the parameter space,
small values of tan$\beta$ are not favored; only for tan$\beta\simeq50$ are
both criteria significantly consistent. In the region where both criteria are

The
deformation is analogous to the so-called $\b$-deformation of $D=3+1$, $\mN=4$
Super Yang-Mills theory, which preserves the conformal symmetry. It is shown
that the deformed matrix model can be considered as a matrix model of M-theory
on a certain curved background in eleven-dimensional supergravity, under a
scaling limit involving the deformation parameter and $N$ (the size of the
matrices). The background belongs to the so-called pp-wave type metric with a
non-constant four-form flux depending linearly on transverse coordinates. Some
stable solutions of the deformed model are studied, which correspond to
membranes with the torus topology. In particular, it is found that apparently
distinct configurations of membranes, having different winding numbers, are
indistinguishable in the matrix model. Simultaneous introduction of both
$\b$-deformation and mass-deformation is also considered, and, in particular, a
situation is found in which the stable membrane configuration interpolates
between a torus and a sphere, depending on the values of the deformation
parameters.

massive stars when the iron core of the star exceeds a mass limit. After
collapse of the core under gravity the shock wave alone does not succeed in
expelling the mass of the star and in this sense the role of neutrinos is the
most important mechanism to do so. During the emission of neutrinos flavor
conversion is possible, related the phenomenon of oscillations, which however
depends directly on the particular density profile of the medium. In this paper
we present results of numerical simulations of neutrino flavor conversion in
protoneutron stars and after collapse. The probabilities of survival for a
given flavor in a complete three-flavors framework is estimated through an
algorithm which conserves unitarity to a high degree of accuracy. The
sensitivity of the results to the different adopted models for the protoneutron
star structure is examined in detail demonstrating how the neutrino signal

evolves more rapidly than previously known spicules, with rapid apparent
motions of 50--150 km s${}^{-1}$, thickness of a few 100 km, and lifetimes of
order 10--60 seconds. These so-called type II spicules have been difficult to
study because of limited spatio-temporal and thermal resolution. Here we use
the IBIS instrument to search for the high velocities in the disk counterpart
of type II spicules. We have detected rapidly evolving events, with lifetimes
that are less than a minute and often equal to the cadence of the instrument
(19 secs). These events are characterized by a Doppler shift that only appears
in the blue wing of the Ca II IR line. Furthermore the spatial extent,
lifetime, and location near network, all suggest a link to type II spicules.
However, the magnitude of the measured Doppler velocity is significantly lower
than the apparent motions seen at the limb. We use Monte Carlo simulations to
show that this discrepancy can be explained by a forward model in which the
visibility on the disk of the high-velocity flows in these events is limited by
a combination of line-of-sight projection and reduced opacity in upward
propelled plasma, especially in reconnection driven jets that are powered by a
roughly constant energy supply.

  Multiple Antennas",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the fading MIMO-MAC with multiple receive
antennas at the base station (BS) and multiple transmit antennas at each mobile
terminal (MT). Two multiple-access techniques are considered for scheduling
transmissions from each MT to the BS at the same frequency, which are
space-division multiple-access (SDMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA).
For SDMA, all MTs transmit simultaneously to the BS and their individual
signals are resolved at the BS via multiple receive antennas while for TDMA,
each MT transmits independently to the BS during mutually orthogonal time
slots. It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) of the fading
channel from each MT to the BS is unknown at each MT transmitter, but is
perfectly known at the BS receiver. Thereby, the BS can acquire the long-term
channel-distribution information (CDI) for each MT. This paper extends the
well-known transmit-covariance feedback scheme for the point-to-point fading
MIMO channel to the fading MIMO-MAC, whereby the BS jointly optimizes the
transmit signal covariance matrices for all MTs based on their CDI, and then
sends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding MT via a
feedback channel. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the so-called
multiuser power region under the multiuser transmit-covariance feedback scheme
for both SDMA and TDMA. The power region is defined as the constitution of all
user transmit power-tuples that can achieve reliable transmissions for a given
set of user target rates. Simulation results show that SDMA can achieve
substantial power savings over TDMA for the fading MIMO-MAC. Moreover, this
paper demonstrates the usefulness of the multiuser power region for maintaining
proportionally-fair power consumption among the MTs.

wireless network with slow fading for support of data traffic having
heterogeneous transmission delay requirements. The multiple-input single-output
(MISO) fading broadcast channel (BC) is of interest where the base station (BS)
employs multiple transmit antennas to realize simultaneous downlink
transmission at the same frequency to multiple mobile users each having a
single receive antenna. An information-theoretic approach is taken for
characterizing capacity limits of the fading MISO-BC under various transmission
delay considerations. First, this paper studies transmit optimization at the BS
when some users have delay-tolerant ``packet'' data and the others have
delay-sensitive ``circuit'' data for transmission at the same time. Based on
the convex optimization framework, an online resource allocation algorithm is
derived that is amenable to efficient cross-layer implementation of both
physical (PHY) -layer multi-antenna transmission and media-access-control (MAC)
-layer multiuser rate scheduling. Secondly, this paper investigates the
fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff for transmission over the fading MISO-BC.
By comparing the network throughput under completely relaxed versus strictly
zero transmission delay constraint, this paper characterizes the limiting loss
in sum capacity due to the vanishing delay tolerance, termed the delay penalty,
under some prescribed user fairness for transmit rate allocation.

identification of phase synchronization in coupled nonidentical piece-wise
linear and in coupled Mackey-Glass time-delay systems with highly

non-synchronized behavior to phase and then to generalized synchronization as a
function of coupling strength. We have introduced a transformation to capture
the phase of the non-phase coherent attractors, which works equally well for
both the time-delay systems. The instantaneous phases of the above coupled
systems calculated from the transformed attractors satisfy both the phase and
mean frequency locking conditions. These transitions are also characterized in
terms of recurrence based indices, namely generalized autocorrelation function
$P(t)$, correlation of probability of recurrence (CPR), joint probability of
recurrence (JPR) and similarity of probability of recurrence (SPR). We have
quantified the different synchronization regimes in terms of these indices. The
existence of phase synchronization is also characterized by typical transitions

the Cr $2p$ XMCD spectra well correspond to the magnetization measured by a

although there are two or more kinds of Cr ions in the Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$Te

Neutral evolution of mutational robustness, 1999 PNAS], by concentrating the
population on regions of high neutrality. Introducing recombination we
demonstrate, through numerically calculating the stationary distribution of an
infinite population on ensembles of random neutral networks that mutational
robustness is significantly enhanced and further that the magnitude of this
enhancement is sensitive to details of the neutral network topology. Through
the simulation of finite populations of genotypes evolving on random neutral
networks and a scaled down microRNA neutral network, we show that even in
finite populations recombination will still act to focus the population on
regions of locally high neutrality.

band, of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer onboard Suzaku provide excellent
spectra of the Galactic center diffuse X-rays (GCDX). This paper reports on the
results of spatially resolved spectroscopy of GCDX. The most pronounced
features of GCDX are the K-shell transition lines from neutral (FeI) and
He-like (FeXXV) irons at energies of 6.4keV and 6.7keV, respectively. The
fluxes of these lines are non-uniformly and asymmetrically distributed with
respect to Sgr A*. The 6.4keV lines are particularly bright on the positive
side of the Galactic longitude (east-side) with clumpy structures. A bright
clump near the GC exhibits a time variability over a timescale of a few years.
Neither the 6.4keV nor 6.7keV line flux shows close proportionality to the
continuum flux (5--10keV band); the 6.4keV line shows excess on the high flux
side, and vice versa for the 6.7keV line. On the other hand, the sum of the
6.4keV plus 6.7keV line fluxes with a ratio of 1:2 shows good proportionality
to the continuum flux, and hence we phenomenologically decomposed the continuum
flux of the GCDX into the 6.4keV- and 6.7keV-associated continuums with a flux
ratio of 1:2. Based on these facts, we have tried to estimate the contribution
of diffuse and integrated flux of point sources to the GCDX.

The electric field orients the target in the space-fixed frame and thereby
effects a striking alteration of the dynamical observables: both the phase and
amplitude of the oscillations in the partial differential cross sections

low-viscosity ergodic state to a viscoelastic non-ergodic state over a wide
range of volume fractions and salt contents. We find that the evolution of
non-ergodicity parameter (Debye-Waller factor) splits into two branches for all
the samples, which correspond to two distinct dynamically arrested states. At
moderately high salt concentrations, on the other hand, a third and new
nonergodic state appears that are different from the above two nonergodic
states. Measurement of the conductivity of Laponite solutions in pure water
shows that the contribution of counterions in the ionic strength is
considerable and their role should be taken into account in interpretations of
aging dynamics and the phase diagram. Based on these data and available data in
the literature, we propose a new (non-equilibrium) phase diagram for Laponite
suspensions.

function is the same as the component of the solar background noise that has an
identical surface spherical harmonic projection (over the corresponding range
of temporal frequency). An important consequence of this surmise is that the
excitation of overtones of a given angular degree and azimuthal order will be
correlated in time. In this note, we introduce the basic principles and a
mathematical description of correlated mode excitation. We use simple,
illustrative examples, involving two modes. Our treatment suggests that in the
real observations, any signatures of the correlation would not appear as a
correlation of the output amplitudes of overtones, but rather as subtle
modifications to the power spectral density at frequencies between the central
frequencies of the overtones. These modifications give a contribution to the
observed peak asymmetries.

magnetism, involving a sizable orbital moment via spin orbit coupling, and a
colossal magnetic anisotropy. We present here a fully-relativistic (spin-orbit
coupling included) pseudo-potential density functional calculation of
electronic and magnetic properties, and of Landauer ballistic conductance of Pt
model nanocontacts consisting of short nanowire segments suspended between Pt
leads or tips, reprented by bulk planes. Even if short, and despite the
nonmagnetic Pt leads, the nanocontact is found to be locally magnetic with
magnetization strictly parallel to its axis. Especially under strain, the
energy barrier to flip the overall spin direction is predicted to be tens of
meV high, and thus the corresponding blocking temperatures large, suggesting
the use of static Landauer ballistic electrical conductance calculations. We
carry out such calculations, to find that inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and
of magnetism lowers the ballistic conductance by about $15\div20$% relative to
the nonmagnetic case, yielding $ G\sim 2 G_0$ ($G_0=2e^2/h$), in good agreement
with break junction results. The spin filtering properties of this highly
unusual spontaneously magnetic nanocontact are also analysed.
