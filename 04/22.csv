: the scalar field dynamics during inflation making no use of the slow-roll

constant during the reheating process, the change of the effective number of
degrees of freedom g_* in the radiation-dominated era, and the anisotropic
stress of free-streaming neutrinos. By numerically solving the evolution of
gravitational waves during and after inflation up to the present, all of these
effects can be examined comprehensively and accurately over a broad spectrum,
even at very high frequencies. We find that the spectrum shows (i) a large
deviation from the spectrum less accurate obtained by Taylor expanding around
the CMB scale using the slow-roll approximation (ii) a characteristic frequency
dependence due to the reheating effect, and (iii) damping due to the g_*
changes and the neutrino anisotropic stress. We suggest that future analysis of
the gravitational wave background should take into consideration the fact that
analytical estimates using the Taylor expansion overestimate the amplitude of
the spectrum.

is related to the MHV rules for computing tree-level gauge amplitudes and used
to extend the MHV rules to graviton scattering. Combinations of unitarity cut
techniques and recursion are used to argue for the ""No-Triangle Hypothesis"" in

CO2 emissions and avoiding the potentially devastating effects of climate
change. The question is: How do we induce a cultural or behavioural change
whereby people nationally and globally adopt more energy efficient lifestyles?
  We propose a new family of mathematical models, based on a statistical
mechanics extension of discrete choice theory, that offer a set of formal tools
to systematically analyse and quantify this problem. An application example
could be to predict the percentage of people choosing to buy new energy
efficient light bulbs instead of the traditional incandescent versions. Through
statistical evaluation of survey responses, the models can identify the key
driving factors in the decision-making process; for example, the extent to
which people imitate each other. These models allow us to incorporate the
effect of social interactions could help us identify 'tipping points' at a
societal level. This knowledge could be used to trigger structural changes in
our society. The results may provide tangible and deliverable evidence-based
policy options to decision-makers.
  We believe that these models offer an opportunity for the research
community-in both the social and physical sciences-and decision-makers in the
private and public sectors to work together towards preventing the potentially
devastating social, economic and environmental effects of climate change.

that is expected to form in a portion of Population III stars with the mass
higher than 100$M_\odot$. In a Population III binary system, a more massive
star can result in the formation of a BH and a surrounding accretion disc. Such
BH accretion could be a significant source of the cosmic reionization in the
early universe. However, a less massive companion star evolves belatedly and
eventually undergoes a SN explosion, so that the accretion disc around a BH
might be blown off in a lifetime of companion star. In this paper, we explore
the dynamical impact of a SN explosion on an accretion disc around a massive
BH, and elucidate whether the BH accretion disc is totally demolished or not.
For the purpose, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a
very massive binary system, where we assume a BH of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ that
results from a direct collapse of a very massive star and a companion star of
$100 M_{\odot}$ that undergoes a SN explosion. We calculate the remaining mass
of a BH accretion disc as a function of time. As a result, it is found that a
significant portion of gas disc can survive through three-dimensional
geometrical effects even after the SN explosion of a companion star. Even if
the SN explosion energy is higher by two orders of magnitude than the binding
energy of gas disc, about a half of disc can be left over. The results imply
that the Population III BH accretion disc can be a long-lived luminous source,
and therefore could be an important ionizing source in the early universe.

SAURON integral-field data, and PN.S velocities, reaching to more than seven
effective radii (R_e). We construct spherical and axisymmetric dynamical models
for these data with the flexible made-to-measure NMAGIC code, in a sequence of
gravitational potentials with varying dark halo mass. We find that the data are
consistent both with near-isotropic spherical systems dominated by the stellar
mass, and with models in massive halos with strongly radially anisotropic outer
parts (beta >~ 0.8 at 7R_e). Formal likelihood limits would exclude (at 1
sigma) the model with stars only, as well as halo models with v_circ(7R_e) >~
250 km/s. A sequence of more realistic axisymmetric models of different
inclinations and a small number of triaxial tests confirm the spherical
results. All valid models fitting all the data are dynamically stable over
Gyrs, including the most anisotropic ones. NGC 3379 may well have a dark matter
halo as predicted by recent merger models within LambdaCDM cosmology, provided
its outer envelope is strongly radially anisotropic. (abridged)

  details in the proofs",,,,"cs.LO cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a committed-choice declarative language
which has been originally designed for writing constraint solvers and which is
nowadays a general purpose language. CHR programs consist of multi-headed
guarded rules which allow to rewrite constraints into simpler ones until a
solved form is reached. Many empirical evidences suggest that multiple heads
augment the expressive power of the language, however no formal result in this
direction has been proved, so far.
  In the first part of this paper we analyze the Turing completeness of CHR
with respect to the underneath constraint theory. We prove that if the
constraint theory is powerful enough then restricting to single head rules does
not affect the Turing completeness of the language. On the other hand,
differently from the case of the multi-headed language, the single head CHR
language is not Turing powerful when the underlying signature (for the
constraint theory) does not contain function symbols.
  In the second part we prove that, no matter which constraint theory is
considered, under some reasonable assumptions it is not possible to encode the
CHR language (with multi-headed rules) into a single headed language while
preserving the semantics of the programs. We also show that, under some
stronger assumptions, considering an increasing number of atoms in the head of
a rule augments the expressive power of the language.
  These results provide a formal proof for the claim that multiple heads
augment the expressive power of the CHR language.

that the observed chemical traits of planetary host stars are primordial in

patient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual
screening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence
of seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the
neurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by
automatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if
not impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for
epilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.
Therefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal
EEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not
aware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately
distinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The
research presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated
diagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the
person is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for
further investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop
such a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build
a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects
an impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's
EEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in
patient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with
96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.

array, with the intention of constraining the resolved high-frequency spectra
of radio galaxies. When combined with other sources we have previously observed
and with data from the BIMA archive, these observations allow us for the first
time to make general statements about the high-frequency behaviour of compact
components of radio galaxies -- cores, jets and hotspots. We find that cores in
our sample remain flat-spectrum up to 90 GHz; jets in some of our targets are
detected at 90 GHz for the first time in our new observations; and hotspots are
found to be almost universal, but show a wide range of spectral properties.
Emission from the extended lobes of radio galaxies is detected in a few cases
and shows rough consistency with the expectations from standard spectral ageing
models, though our ability to probe this in detail is limited by the
sensitivity of BIMA. We briefly discuss the prospects for radio-galaxy
astrophysics with ALMA.

comets indicates an extensive radial mixing in the primordial solar nebula. In
studying the radial transport of matter within protoplanetary disks by
numerical model calculations it is essential to resolve the vertical disk
structure since matter is mixed radially inward and outward by a complex
2-dimensional flow pattern that is superposed on the global inward directed
accretion flow. A numerical model calculation for a protoplanetary accretion
disks with radial and vertical mixing is performed in the 1+1-dimensional
approximation. The global 2D velocity field of the disk is calculated from an
analytical solution for the meridional flow pattern, that exhibits an inward
drift in the upper layers and an outward drift in the midplane in most parts of
the disk. The disk model is based on the $\beta$-prescription of viscosity and
considers vertical self-gravitation of the disk. The mixing processes are
studied for the following species: amorphous silicate grains (forsterite,
enstatite) that crystallise by annealing, and carbonaceous grains that are
destroyed by surface reactions with OH molecules at elevated temperatures.
Considerable fractions of crystallised silicates and methane (formed as a
by-product of carbon combustion) are transported to the site of comet formation
far from the protosun within a period of 10$^6$ yrs. The 2-dimensional
transport of tracers in the solar nebula offers a natural explanation for the
presence of crystalline silicates in comets and the significant portions of
crystalline silicates observed in accretion disks around young stellar objects.

predictive value of the adjustment is scrutinized by performing systematic
variations with respect to chosen nuclear matter properties (incompressibility,
effective mass, symmetry energy, and sum-rule enhancement factor). We find that
the ground-state data, although representing a large sample, leave a broad

from giant resonances is added to pin down more precisely the open features. We
then apply the set of newly adjusted parameterizations to several more detailed
observables such as neutron skin, isotope shifts, and super-heavy elements. The
techniques of least-squares fitting provide safe estimates for the

to disentangle the various influences on a given observable and to estimate the

computational method for describing elastic transport in molecular devices.
This can be extended to include inelastic scattering by the so called
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), where the interaction of the
electrons with the vibrations of the molecule is assumed to be weak and it is
treated perturbatively. The validity of such an assumption and therefore of the
SCBA is difficult to establish with certainty. In this work we explore the
limitations of the SCBA by using a simple tight-binding model with the
electron-phonon coupling strength $\rm{\alpha}$ chosen as a free parameter. As
model devices we consider Au mono-atomic chains and a $\rm{H_2}$ molecule
sandwiched between Pt electrodes. In both cases our self-consistent
calculations demonstrate a breakdown of the SCBA for large $\rm{\alpha}$ and we
identify a weak and strong coupling regime. For weak coupling our SCBA results
compare closely with those obtained with exact scattering theory. However in
the strong coupling regime large deviations are found. In particular we
demonstrate that there is a critical coupling strength, characteristic of the
materials system, beyond which multiple self-consistent solutions can be found
depending on the initial conditions in the simulation. We attribute these
features to the breakdown of the perturbative expansion leading to the SCBA.

issue in detail here in two different ways: (1) first we explore the effect of
choice of different parameter priors on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio r and other parameters describing inflation, and (2) we examine the
Bayesian complexity in order to determine how effectively existing data can
constrain inflationary parameters. We demonstrate that existing data are not
strong enough to render full inflationary parameter estimates in a
parametrization- and prior-independent way and that the predicted tensor signal
is particularly sensitive to different priors. For parametrizations where the
Bayesian complexity is comparable to the number of free parameters we find that
a flat prior on the scale of inflation (which is to be distinguished from a
flat prior on the tensor-to-scalar ratio) leads us to infer a larger, and in
fact slightly nonzero tensor contribution at 68% confidence level. However, no
detection is claimed. Our results demonstrate that all that is statistically
relevant at the current time is the (slightly enhanced) upper bound on r, and
we stress that the data remain consistent with r = 0.

observation by XMM-Newton we show that the power spectrum of this source is
well fitted by a bending power law model, and the bend time-scale Tb is
precisely at the value predicted by the Tb vs Hbeta line-width relation of
McHardy et al. Variations in different energy bands show time-scale dependent
time lags, where higher energy bands lag lower ones. The lag, tau, varies as a
function of the Fourier frequency, f, of the variability component in the light
curves as tau propto 1/f at low frequencies, but there is a sharp cut-off in
the lags at a frequency close to the bend frequency in the power spectrum.
Similar behaviour is seen in black hole X-ray binary systems. The length of the
time lags increases continuously with energy separation, in an almost
log-linear relation. We show that the lag spectra can be produced by
fluctuations propagating through the accretion flow as long as the energy

dynamical Jeans instability is stabilized by radiation pressure on scales
smaller than the adiabatic Jeans length, on these same spatial scales the
medium is unstable to a diffusive mode. In this regime, neglecting gas
pressure, the characteristic timescale for growth is independent of spatial
scale and given by (3 kappa c_s^2)/(4 pi G c), where c_s is the adiabatic sound
speed. This timescale is that required for a fluid parcel to radiate away its

the medium is dynamically unstable unless the gas-only Jeans criterion is

discuss several applications, including photons diffusing in regions of extreme
star formation (starburst galaxies & pc-scale AGN disks), and the diffusion of
cosmic rays in normal galaxies and galaxy clusters. The former (particularly,
starbursts) are ""rapidly"" diffusing and thus cannot be supported against
dynamical instability in the linear regime by radiation pressure alone. The
latter are more nearly ""slowly"" diffusing. I speculate that the turbulence in
starbursts may be driven by the dynamical coupling between the radiation field

end-functional phosphonated-PEG oligomers. The complexation process and
structure of the resulting hybrid core-shell singlet nanocolloids are
described, characterized and modeled using light and neutron scattering data.
The adsorption mechanism is non-stoichiometric, yielding the number of adsorbed
chains per particle Nads = 270 at saturation. Adsorption isotherms show a high
affinity of the phosphonate head for the ceria surface (adsorption energy ~ -16
kT) suggesting an electrostatic driving force for the complexation. The ease,
efficiency and integrity of the complexation is highlighted by the formation of
nanometric sized cerium oxide particles covered with a well anchored PEG layer,
maintaining the characteristics of the original sol. This solvating brush-like
layer is sufficient to solubilize the particles and greatly expand the
stability range of the original sol up to pH = 9. We underscore two key
attributes of the tailored sol: i) strong UV absorption capability after
functionalization and ii) ability to re-disperse after freeze-drying as powder
in aqueous or organic solvents in varying concentrations as singlet
nanocolloids. This robust platform enables translation of intrinsic properties
of mineral oxide nanoparticles to critical end use.

model (AIM) employing both Keldysh perturbation theory in a Fermi liquid
picture and the Bethe ansatz. In the Fermi liquid approach, the object of our
principal interest is the generating function for the cumulants of the charge
current distribution. We derive an exact analytic formula relating the full
counting statistic (FCS) generating function to the self-energy of the system
in the presence of a measuring field. We first check that our approach
reproduces correctly known results in simple limits, like the FCS of the
resonant level system (AIM without Coulomb interaction). We then proceed to
study the FCS for the AIM perturbatively in the Coulomb interaction. By
comparing this perturbative analysis with a strong coupling expansion, we
arrive at a conjecture for an expression for the FCS generating function at
O(V^3) (V is the voltage across the impurity) valid at all orders in the
interaction.
  In the second part of the article, we examine a Bethe ansatz analysis of the
current noise for the AIM. Unlike the Fermi liquid approach, here the goal is
to obtain qualitative, not quantitative, results for a wider range of voltages
both in and out of a magnetic field. Particularly notable are finite field
results showing a double peaked structure in the current noise for voltages
satisfying eV ~ mu H$. This double peaked structure is the ``smoking gun'' of
Kondo physics in the current noise and is directly analogous to the single peak
structure predicted for the differential conductance of the AIM.

generate the PDFs - perturbing the object colors by their measurement error -
and using the resulting instances of nearest neighbor distributions to generate
numerous individual redshifts. When the redshifts are compared to existing SDSS
spectroscopic data, we find that the mean value of each PDF has a dispersion
between the photometric and spectroscopic redshift consistent with other
machine learning techniques, being sigma = 0.0207 +/- 0.0001 for main sample
galaxies to r < 17.77 mag, sigma = 0.0243 +/- 0.0002 for luminous red galaxies
to r < ~19.2 mag, and sigma = 0.343 +/- 0.005 for quasars to i < 20.3 mag. The
PDFs allow the selection of subsets with improved statistics. For quasars, the
improvement is dramatic: for those with a single peak in their probability
distribution, the dispersion is reduced from 0.343 to sigma = 0.117 +/- 0.010,
and the photometric redshift is within 0.3 of the spectroscopic redshift for
99.3 +/- 0.1% of the objects. Thus, for this optical quasar sample, we can
virtually eliminate 'catastrophic' photometric redshift estimates. In addition
to the SDSS sample, we incorporate ultraviolet photometry from the Third Data

result of (a) not implementing the periodicity brought about by the possible

Feynman parameter integration, which seemingly simplifies the expression but in
practice introduces a spurious endpoint singularity. Using the MST, there are
no problems related to the implementation of the periodicity but instead, care
has to be taken when the sum of denominators of the original amplitude
vanishes. We apply the method to the computation of loop integrals appearing

dipole radiation with recent soft gamma-ray observations leads to deriving an
extreme set of parameters (magnetic field, period and spin down rate) for the

values are explored. Methods: The properties of the putative pulsar are
calculated assuming that the 20-100 keV luminosity corresponds to 1% of Edot,
that the source is 4.5 kpc away, and that the pulsar age is 300 yrs. This gives
P = 0.55 s, Pdot = 3E-11 s/s, and B = 1.28E14 G. This is a very extreme set
compared to the population of known pulsars in PWN systems. Using the equations
for magnetic dipole losses makes it possible to adjust the initial assumptions
to see what is required for a more reasonable set of pulsar parameters.
Results: The current measured properties for IGR J18135-1751/HESS J1813-178

function collapse is an experimentally testable alternative to non-relativistic
quantum mechanics. In it, collapse occurs because particles interact with a
classical random field. However, particles gain energy from this field, i.e.,
particle energy is not conserved. Recently, it has been shown how to construct
a theory dubbed ""completely quantized collapse"" (CQC) which is predictively
equivalent to CSL. In CQC, a quantized random field is introduced, and CSL's
classical random field becomes its eigenvalue. In CQC, energy is conserved,
which allows one to understand that energy is conserved in CSL, as the
particle's energy gain is compensated by the random field's energy loss. Since
the random field has energy, it should have gravitational consequences. For
that, one needs to know the random field's energy density. In this paper, it is
shown how to construct a symmetric, conserved, energy-momentum-stress-density

no dynamical equation and has no Lagrangian. Then, three examples are given

  Feedback","In revision for IEEE Transactions on Communications, April 2008",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of combining beamforming and space-time coding in this work is to
obtain full-diversity order and to provide additional received power (array
gain) compared to conventional space-time codes. In our system, we consider a
quasi-static fading environment and we incorporate both high-rate and low-rate
feedback channels with possible feedback errors. To utilize feedback
information, a class of code constellations is proposed, inspired from
orthogonal designs and precoded space-time block codes, which is called
generalized partly orthogonal designs or generalized PODs. Furthermore, to
model feedback errors, we assume that the feedback bits go through binary
symmetric channels (BSCs). Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error
probability is known a priori to the transmission ends and second, when it is
not known exactly. In the first case, we derive a minimum pairwise error
probability (PEP) design criterion for generalized PODs. Then we design the
quantizer for the erroneous feedback channel and the precoder codebook of PODs
based on this criterion. The quantization scheme in our system is a channel
optimized vector quantizer (COVQ). In the second case, the design of the
quantizer and the precoder codebook is based on similar approaches, however
with a worst-case design strategy. The attractive property of our combining
scheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and
erroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free
feedback. This scheme shows desirable robustness against feedback channel
modeling mismatch.

Weibull and the Tsallis $q$-exponential distributions. Maximum likelihood

and reconstruction of sparse phenomena from noisy projections. We consider two
settings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and
input noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider
two types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared
errors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, $m$, and $\snr$, to
signal sparsity, $k$, distortion level, $d$, and signal dimension, $n$. We
consider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations
of Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of
measurements and $\snr$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient
conditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel
superposition property. In particular this property implies that small support
errors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not
suffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of
max-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise
models we show that asymptotically an $\snr$ of $\Theta(\log(n))$ together with
$\Theta(k \log(n/k))$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact
support recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be
tolerated, a constant $\snr$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity
regime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails
if the number of measurements scales as $o(n\log(n)/SNR)$ implying poor
compression performance for such cases. We also consider Bayesian set-up and
characterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of
measurements using rate-distortion theory.

a single constraint with multiple auxiliary variables. Fixing these multiple

Our duality result can solve the optimization problem for MIMO-BC with multiple
linear constraints, and thus can be viewed as an extension of the conventional
results, which rely crucially on a single sum power constraint. Furthermore, we
develop an efficient sub-gradient based iterative algorithm to solve the

strongly modify the surface band structures with the appearance of intragap

account for electron affinity variations with respect to the stoichiometric

compare the observed number counts of the high redshift passively evolving

model without density evolution fails to explain the observed counts at faint

consistent with the observed counts of the passively evolving population. We
also compare our observed counts of dusty star-forming EROs with a
phenomenological evolutionary model postulating that the near-infrared EROs can
be explained by the source densities of the far-infrared - submillimetre

explained assuming a 25 percent contribution of submillimetre star-forming
galaxies with the majority of brighter Ks -band detected dusty EROs having

column density equal to the Galactic value of 2.1 X 10^{21} cm^{-2}. During the

the inner disk radius remained constant at ~6 X 10^8 cm. This translates into a

instrument (Kervella & Domiciano de Souza 2007) revealed a faint companion to
Achernar, the brightest Be star in the sky. The present observations are
intended to characterize the physical nature of this object. Methods: We
obtained near-IR images and an H-band spectrum of Achernar B using the VLT/NACO
adaptive optics systems. Results: Our images clearly show the displacement of
Achernar B over a portion of its orbit around Achernar A. Although these data
are insuficient to derive the orbital parameters, they indicate a period of the
order of 15 yr. The projected angular separation of the two objects in December
2007 was smaller than 0.15 arcsec, or 6.7 AU at the distance of Achernar.
Conclusions: From its flux distribution in the near- and thermal-IR, Achernar B
is most likely an A1V-A3V star. Its orbital period appears similar to the
observed pseudo-periodicity of the Be phenomenon of Achernar. This indicates
that an interaction between A and B at periastron could be the trigger of the
Be episodes.

the near-infrared galaxy luminosity function, from the local Universe out to
z~4. The analysis is based on a large and highly complete sample of galaxies
selected from the first data release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey.
Exploiting a master catalogue of K- and z-band selected galaxies over an area
of 0.7 square degrees, we analyse a sample of ~50,000 galaxies, all with
reliable photometry in 16-bands from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.
The unique combination of large area and depth provided by the Ultra Deep
Survey allows us to trace the evolution of the K-band luminosity function with
unprecedented accuracy. In particular, via a maximum likelihood analysis we
obtain a simple parameterization for the luminosity function and its
cosmological evolution, including both luminosity and density evolution, which
provides an excellent description of the data from z =0 up to z~4. We find
differential evolution for galaxies dependent on galaxy luminosity, revealing
once again the ``down-sizing behaviour'' of galaxy formation. Finally, we
compare our results with the predictions of the latest theoretical models of
galaxy formation, based both on semi-analytical prescriptions, and on full
hydrodynamical simulations.

the compression wave become comparable at sufficiently high values of the Mach
number. In the case of relatively large Mach number, viscous heating is
investigated by direct numerical simulations. The simulations were performed on
the basis of compressible Navier-Stokes gas-dynamic equations taking into

heating and explosion of the fuel mixture preferential at the walls. The
explosion develops in an essentially multi-dimensional way, with fast
spontaneous reaction spreading along the walls and pushing inclined shocks.

a central star surrounded by an axisymmetric circumstellar disc, but without an

structural properties of the disc and its gas and dust content. We modelled the
dust disc with a 3D continuum radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a
Monte-Carlo method that provides synthetic scattered light images and
polarisation maps, as well as spectral energy distributions. We find that the
disc images and spectral energy distribution narrowly constrain many of the
disc model parameters, such as a total dust mass of 1.0-1.75x10^-4 sollar
masses and an inclination of 62-63 degrees. The maximum grain size required to
fit all available data is of the order of 1.6-2.8 microns although the upper
end of this range is loosely constrained. The observed optical polarisation map
is reproduced well by the same disc model, suggesting that the geometry we find
is adequate and the optical properties are representative of the visible dust
content. We compare the inferred dust column density to the gas column density
derived from the X-ray spectrum and find a gas-to-dust ratio along the line of
sight that is consistent with the ISM value. To our knowledge, this measurement
is the first to directly compare dust and gas column densities in a

transport) measurements of nanocrystals of half-doped
$\mathrm{La_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}MnO_3}$(LCMO) synthesized by chemical route, having
particle size down to an average diameter of 15nm. It was observed that the
size reduction leads to change in crystal structure and the room temperature
structure is arrested so that the structure does not evolve on cooling unlike
bulk samples. The structural change mainly affects the orthorhombic distortion
of the lattice. By making comparison with observed crystal structure data under
hydrostatic pressure it is suggested that the change in the crystal structure
of the nanocrystals occurs due to an effective hydrostatic pressure created by
the surface pressure on size reduction. This not only changes the structure but
also causes the room temperature structure to freeze-in. The size reduction
also does not allow the long supercell modulation needed for the Charge
Ordering, characteristic of this half-doped manganite, to set-in. The magnetic
and transport measurements also show that the Charge Ordering (CO) does not
occur when the size is reduced below a critical size. Instead, the nanocrystals
show ferromagnetic ordering down to the lowest temperatures along with metallic

several blazars at z > 0.1 have placed stringent constraints on the elusive
spectrum and intensity of the intergalactic infrared background radiation
(IIBR). Correcting their observed VHE spectrum for gamma-gamma absorption even
by the lowest plausible level of the IIBR provided evidence for a very hard
(photon spectral index Gamma_{ph} < 2) intrinsic source spectrum out to TeV
energies. Such a hard VHE gamma-ray spectrum poses a serious challenge to the
conventional synchrotron-self-Compton interpretation of the VHE emission of TeV
blazars and suggests the emergence of a separate emission component beyond a
few hundred GeV. Here we propose that such a very hard, slowly variable VHE
emission component in TeV blazars may be produced via Compton upscattering of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons by shock-accelerated electrons in an
extended jet. For the case of 1ES 1101-232, this component could dominate the
bolometric luminosity of the extended jet if the magnetic fields are of the

relativity for describing, at some effective or phenomenological level, the

standard dark energy (a cosmological constant Lambda) plus standard dark matter
(a pressureless perfect fluid), and therefore benefits from the successes of
the Lambda-CDM (Lambda-cold dark matter) scenario at cosmological scales.
Invoking an argument of ""weak clusterisation"" of the mass distribution of
dipole moments, we find that the dipolar dark matter reproduces the
phenomenology of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales. The
dipolar medium action naturally contains a cosmological constant, and we show
that if the model is to come from some fundamental underlying physics, the
cosmological constant Lambda should be of the order of a0^2/c^4, where a0

clear from simulations whether an S+E merger leads to a gas concentration in
the nucleus, resulting in a starburst, or whether the gas is spread out and
therefore too diffuse for new star forming regions. We used the Westerbork
Radio Synthesis Telescope to observe the properties of the HI. By using this
interferometer, we are able to study the large-scale HI distribution and
kinematics with high spatial and velocity resolution. We found two HI tails
extending out to more than 40 kpc. In a central disc, the gas shows a fairly
regular rotation pattern indicating that the gas started to settle after the
merger. The total HI mass adds up to $1.5 \cdot 10^9 M_{\odot}$. By comparing
the high resolution HI maps with deep optical images, differences between the

producing planetesimals which have properties matching those of primitive
meteorite parent bodies. We call this ""primary accretion"". The scenario draws
on elements of previous work, and introduces a new critical threshold for
planetesimal formation. We presume the nebula to be weakly turbulent, which
leads to dense concentrations of aerodynamically size-sorted particles having
properties like those observed in chondrites. The fractional volume of the
nebula occupied by these dense zones or clumps obeys a probability distribution
as a function of their density, and the densest concentrations have particle
mass density 100 times that of the gas. However, even these densest clumps are
prevented by gas pressure from undergoing gravitational instability in the
traditional sense (on a dynamical timescale). While in this state of arrested
development, they are susceptible to disruption by the ram pressure of the
differentially orbiting nebula gas. However, self-gravity can preserve
sufficiently large and dense clumps from ram pressure disruption, allowing
their entrained particles to sediment gently but inexorably towards their
centers, producing 10-100 km ""sandpile"" planetesimals. Localized radial
pressure fluctuations in the nebula, and interactions between differentially
moving dense clumps, will also play a role that must be allowed for in future
studies. The scenario is readily extended from meteorite parent bodies to
primary accretion throughout the solar system.

Detecting regular dips in the light curve of a star is an easy way
to detect the presence of an orbiting planet. COROT is a Franco-European
mission launched at the end of 2006, and one of its main objectives is to
detect planetary systems using the transit method. Aims. In this paper, we
present a new method for transit detection and determine the smallest detected
planetary radius, assuming a parent star like the Sun. Methods. We simulated
light curves with Poisson noise and stellar variability, for which data from
the VIRGO/PMO6 instrument on board SoHO were used. Transits were simulated
using the UTM software. Light curves were denoised by the mean of a low-pass
and a high-pass filter. The detection of periodic transits works on light
curves folded at several trial periods with the particularity that no rebinning
is performed after the folding. The best fit was obtain when all transits are
overlayed, i.e when the data are folded at the right period. Results. Assuming
a single data set lasting 150d, transits from a planet with a radius down to 2
Rearth can be detected. The efficiency depends neither on the transit duration
nor on the number of transits observed. Furthermore we simulated transits with
periods close to 150d in data sets containing three observations of 150d,
separated by regular gaps with the same length. Again, planets with a radius
down to 2 Rearth can be detected. Conclusions. Within the given range of
parameters, the detection efficiency depends slightly on the apparent magnitude
of the star but neither on the transit duration nor the number of transits.
Furthermore, multiple observations might represent a solution for the COROT
mission for detecting small planets when the orbital period is much longer than
the duration of a single observation.

except in the case of negative streamers in homogeneous fields. We characterize
the streamers by length, head radius, head charge and field enhancement. We
show that the velocity of positive streamers is mainly determined by their
radius and in quantitative agreement with recent experimental results both for
radius and velocity. The velocity of negative streamers is dominated by
electron drift in the enhanced field; in the low local fields of the present
simulations, it is little influenced by photo-ionization. Though negative
streamer fronts always move at least with the electron drift velocity in the
local field, this drift motion broadens the streamer head, decreases the field
enhancement and ultimately leads to slower propagation or even extinction of
the negative streamer.

magnetic response of the atoms. Current proposals for such systems achieve an
enhancement of the magnetic response by a suitable laser field configuration,
but still rely on high gas densities. Thus further progress is desirable, and
this requires an understanding of the precise mechanism for the enhancement.
Therefore, here we study the magnetic and electric response to a probe field
interacting with three-level atoms in ladder configuration. In our first model,
the three transitions are driven by a control field and the electric and
magnetic component of the probe field, giving rise to a closed interaction
loop. In a reference model, the coherent driving is replaced by an incoherent
pump field. A time-dependent analysis of the closed-loop system enables us to
identify the different contributions to the medium response. A comparison with
the reference system then allows one to identify the physical mechanism that
leads to the enhancement. It is found that the enhancement occurs at so-called
multiphoton resonance by a scattering of the coupling field and the electric
probe field mode into the magnetic probe field mode. Based on these results,
conditions for the enhancement are discussed.

the L\'evy ratchet has to be based on the characteristics of directionality

the interquantile distance giving the measure of the distributions' width.

this work is to compare two different formulations in which a correcting term
allows to improve the amplitude of the numerical solution. It comes out that
even if the two systems are equivalent from a theoretical point of view,
nothing of the kind is as far as the numerical simulation is concerned. Herein
a numerical analysis is performed to show that as long as the propagation
medium is smooth, both the models are equivalent but it is no more the case
when the medium is associated to a quite strongly discontinuous velocity.
