dimension to be precisely mapped to the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in
terms of a specific light-front impact variable $\zeta$ which measures the
separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron. This
mapping was originally obtained by matching the exact expression for
electromagnetic current matrix elements in AdS space with the corresponding
exact expression for the current matrix element using light-front theory in
physical space-time. More recently we have shown that one obtains the identical
holographic mapping using matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor, thus
providing an important consistency test and verification of holographic mapping
from AdS to physical observables defined on the light-front. The resulting
light-front Schrodinger equations predicted from AdS/QCD give a good

space-time of a higher-dimensional cosmology where the observable Universe is a
D3-brane. The interaction of an open string representing a photon with a
D-particle stretches and excites the string, which subsequently decays and
re-emits the photon with a time delay that increases linearly with the photon
energy and is related to stringy uncertainty principles. We relate this
derivation to other descriptions of the quantum-gravitational refractive index

morphology-density relation (Dressler 1980) in that the effect manifests itself
only at cluster-type densities, and indeed when we plot both the HI

the algorithm is that it is affine-invariant, i.e., it produces the same
partition for any affine transformation of the input. It has strong guarantees
when the input is drawn from a mixture model. For a mixture of two arbitrary
Gaussians, the algorithm correctly classifies the sample assuming only that the
two components are separable by a hyperplane, i.e., there exists a halfspace
that contains most of one Gaussian and almost none of the other in probability
mass. This is nearly the best possible, improving known results substantially.
For k > 2 components, the algorithm requires only that there be some
(k-1)-dimensional subspace in which the emoverlap in every direction is small.
Here we define overlap to be the ratio of the following two quantities: 1) the
average squared distance between a point and the mean of its component, and 2)
the average squared distance between a point and the mean of the mixture. The
main result may also be stated in the language of linear discriminant analysis:
if the standard Fisher discriminant is small enough, labels are not needed to
estimate the optimal subspace for projection. Our main tools are isotropic
transformation, spectral projection and a simple reweighting technique. We call
this combination isotropic PCA.

dependence of in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the equation of
state of neutron-rich nuclear matter, particularly the isospin-dependent term
in the equation of state, i.e., the density dependence of the symmetry energy.
Because of its great importance for understanding many phenomena in both
nuclear physics and astrophysics, the study of the density dependence of the
nuclear symmetry energy has been the main focus of the intermediate-energy
heavy-ion physics community during the last decade, and significant progress
has been achieved both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, a
number of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to
the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies
have confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed
us to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation
densities. The impacts of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry
energy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were
found to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities
provided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around
the world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the
forefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the
major progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy
ion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in
this field.

excludes the three Ca II triplet lines and instead relies on a plethora of
weaker lines. Unlike empirical metallicity estimators, such as the equivalent
width of the Ca II triplet, the synthetic method presented here is applicable
over an arbitrarily wide metallicity range and is independent of assumptions
about the alpha enhancement. Estimates of cluster mean [Fe/H] from different

metal-rich clusters. The scatter in HRS abundance estimates among individual
stars in a given cluster is also comparable to 0.1 dex. By comparison, the

days), that go back more than a century, show a decrease from 120 mmag to 30
mmag (V magnitude) around the turn of the millennium. It has been speculated
that the reason for the decrease in amplitude is the evolution of Polaris
towards the edge of the instability strip. However, our new data reveal an
increase in the amplitude by about 30% from 2003-2006. It now appears that the
amplitude change is cyclic rather than monotonic, and most likely the result of
a pulsation phenomenon. In addition, previous radial velocity campaigns have
claimed the detection of long-period variation in Polaris (P > 40 days). Our
radial velocity data are more precise than previous datasets, and we find no
evidence for additional variation for periods in the range 3-50 days with an
upper limit of 100 m/s. However, in the WIRE data we find evidence of variation
on time-scales of 2-6 days, which we interpret as being due to granulation.

that, while most stars orbit within a well-defined disc, a significant fraction
have large eccentricities and / or inclinations with respect to the disc plane.
Here, we investigate whether this dynamically hot component could have arisen
via scattering from an initially cold disc -- the expected initial condition if
the stars formed from the fragmentation of an accretion disc. Using N-body
methods, we evolve a variety of flat, cold, stellar systems, and study the
effects of initial disc eccentricity, primordial binaries, very massive stars
and intermediate mass black holes. We find, consistent with previous results,
that a circular disc does not become eccentric enough unless there is a
significant population of undetected 100--1000 Msun objects. However, since
fragmentation of an eccentric disc can readily yield eccentric stellar orbits,
the strongest constraints come from inclinations. We show that_none_ of our
initial conditions yield the observed large inclinations, regardless of the
initial disc eccentricity or the presence of massive objects. These results
imply that the orbits of the young massive stars in the Galactic Centre are
largely primordial, and that the stars are unlikely to have formed as a
dynamically cold disc.

this source provide relatively detailed constraints on its post-explosion
expansion and progenitor history, including an preliminary angular size
constaint from VLBI. The archival X-ray and radio data imply that the
progenitor of SN1996cr evacuated a large cavity just prior to exploding: the
blast wave likely expanded for ~1-2 yrs before eventually striking the dense
circumstellar material which surrounds SN1996cr. The X-ray and radio emission,
which trace the progenitor mass-loss rate, have respectively risen by a factor
of ~2 and remained roughly constant over the past 7 yr. This behavior is
reminiscent of the late rise of SN1987A, but 1000 times more luminous and much
more rapid to onset. Complex Oxygen line emission in the optical spectrum
further hints at a possible concentric shell or ring-like structure. The
discovery of SN1996cr suggests that a substantial fraction of the closest SNe

their velocity distribution. Observational results were compared with a cluster
simulation. The maps of gas temperature and density distribution from the
simulation agree with the observational data in the case of a cluster merger
nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky and in the state after the maximum
core collapse. We conclude that we are observing a galaxy cluster in a major
merger phase, just after the maximum core collapse. The mass ratio is about
1:2, and the merger collision is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky.
A shock is present in the northern cluster region, and it is very likely

amplification that will give cause the cluster relics. The relative position of

The Robinson-Trautman equation was integrated for these initial data using a

is a boosted black hole with Bondi mass greater than the sum of the individual
mass of each initial black hole. Two relevant aspects of the process are
presented. The first relates the efficiency $\Delta$ of the energy extraction
by gravitational wave emission to the mass of the final black hole. This
relation is fitted by a distribution function of non-extensive thermostatistics
with entropic parameter $q \simeq 1/2$; the result extends and validates
analysis based on the linearized theory of gravitational wave emission. The
second is a typical bremsstrahlung angular pattern in the early period of

method is based on minimizing a functional (of the initial condition and the

zero. We solve an adjoint PDE to compute the gradient of this functional with
respect to the initial condition. We include additional terms in the functional

the linearized problem by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem in
closed form. We then use our numerical method to continue these solutions
beyond the realm of linear theory until another traveling wave is reached. By
experimentation with data fitting, we identify the analytical form of the
solutions on the path connecting the one-hump stationary solution to the
two-hump traveling wave. We then derive exact formulas for these solutions by
explicitly solving the system of ODE's governing the evolution of solitons

X-ray emission below 10 keV in the typical high-energy peaked BL Lac object

the 0.6--10 keV X-ray spectra of the source harden ($\Delta\Gamma \sim$
0.1--0.3) at break energies of about 4 keV. The concave X-ray spectra of the
source could be easily interpretated by a mixture of a steep component (i.e.,
the high energy tail of the synchrotron emission) and a flat one (i.e., the low
energy side of the IC emission). However, the steep spectra ($\Gamma \sim$ 2.3)
in the hard X-rays indicate that the synchrotron emission still domiantes over
the IC one, while the latter is effectively present and perceived as flattening
the synchrotron spectrum in this energy range. The quasi-simultaneous
optical-UV-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) obtained with XMM-Newton
suggest that the concave X-ray spectra of the source could be the result of
down-ward shift of the synchrotron peak frequency to the optical band, incuring
the IC emisssion to become more important in the hard ($\sim 4$--10 keV) X-ray
band with respective to other cases in which the synchrotron emission peaks in
the UV-soft-X-ray range. This discovery provides a new clue for a smooth
transition between HBLs and the low-energy peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs).

<100Myr,and have masses in the range 10^3-3*10^6M, with a peak ~10^4.7M.The

follow the Schmidt--Kennicutt scaling law of star formation,and that star
formation is occurring in regions with gas dens ities at approximately (within
a factor of a few) the critical density value de -rived according to the Toomre

for a fixed x \approx 0.33, the magnetic transition changes over from first
order to second order on reducing the particle size to nearly few tens of a
nanometer. The change-over is brought about only by reducing the size and with
no change in the stoichiometry. The size reduction to an average size of about
15 nm retains the ferromagnetic state albeit with somewhat smaller saturation
magnetization and the ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{C} is suppressed
by a small amount (4%). The magnetization of the nanoparticles near T_{C}
follow the scaling equation $M/|\epsilon|^\beta =
f_\pm(H/|\epsilon|^{\gamma+\beta})$, where, $\epsilon = |T-T_C|/T_C$. The
critical exponents, associated with the transition have been obtained from
modified Arrott plots and they are found to be $\beta=0.47\pm 0.01$ and
$\gamma=1.06\pm 0.03$. From a plot of M vs H at T_{C} we find the exponent
$\delta=3.10 \pm 0.13$. All the exponents are close to the mean field values.
The change-over of the order of the transition has been attributed to a
lowering of the value of the derivative dT_{C}/dP due to an increased pressure
in the nanoparticles arising due to size reduction. This effect acts in tandem
with the rounding off effect due to random strain in the nanoparticles.

hence, a technique exists for decomposing a signal into its sinusoidal
components. From this theory an entire branch of research has flourished: from
the Short-Time or Windowed Fourier Transform to the Wavelets, the Frames, and
lately the Generic Frequency Analysis. The aim of this paper is to take the
Frequency Analysis a step further. It will be shown that keeping the same
reconstruction algorithm as the Fourier Theorem but changing to a new computing
method for the analysis phase allows the generalization of the Fourier Theorem
to a large class of nonorthogonal bases. New methods and algorithms can be
employed in function decomposition on such generic bases. It will be shown that
these algorithms are a generalization of the Fourier analysis, i.e. they are
reduced to the familiar Fourier tools when using orthogonal bases. The
differences between this tool and the wavelets and frames theories will be
discussed. Examples of analysis and reconstruction of functions using the given
algorithms and nonorthogonal bases will be given. In this first part the focus
will be on vectorial decomposition, while the second part will be on phased
decomposition. The phased decomposition thanks to a single function basis has
many interesting consequences and applications.

itself with a non-canonical kinetic lagrangian and comes from the large volume
approach to the moduli stabilization in flux compactification of type IIB
superstring on a Calabi-Yau orientifold of $h^{(1,2)} > h^{(1,1)}\geq 4$. The
K\""ahler moduli are classified as volume modulus, heavy moduli and two light
moduli. The axion-dilaton, complex structure moduli and all heavy K\""ahler
moduli including the volume modulus are frozen by nonperturbatively corrected
flux superpotential and the $\alpha^\prime$-corrected K\""ahler potential in the
large volume limit. The minimum of the scalar potential at which the heavy
moduli are stabilized provides the dominant potential energy for the survived
light K\""ahler moduli. We consider a simplified case where the axionic
components in the light K\""ahler moduli are further stabilized at the potential
minimum and only the geometrical components are taken as the scalar fields to
drive an assisted-like inflation. For a certain range of moduli stabilization
parameters and inflation initial conditions, we obtain a nearly flat power
spectrum of the curvature perturbation, with $n_s\approx 0.96$ at Hubble-exit,
and an inflationary energy scale of $3 \times 10^{14}$ GeV. In our model,
significant correlation exists between the curvature and isocurvature
perturbations on super-Hubble scales so that at the end of inflation a great
deal of the curvature power spectrum originates from this correlation.

envisaged by the above-mentioned models are nonrepresentative in the sense of
the reflection of realities. It became obvious that the techniques of the
theory of linear differential equations were insufficient here. Accordingly,
the scientists' attention switched to the theory of nonlinear differential
equations. At the same time, balance and, accordingly, the model with matrix
properties are objectively inherent in the economic system. For the reduction
of this model to a differential form, there exist rather elementary means that
proved to be unclaimed. Macroeconomic rhetoric - the power of the accelerator,
a lag on the part of demand, etc. - accompanied by the use of a lot of abstract
coefficients prevailed. However, there is no organic interrelation between
matrix and nonlinear differential equations. On the contrary, it can be said
that linear theory of integral equations originated in matrix analysis. The
Fredholm linear integral equation of the second kind with a parameter-dependent
kernel proves to be rather representative with regard to the class of possible
solutions. It seems that it can be used for the description of any zigzags of
the economy. The price one has to pay for this is the nontriviality of existing

Fast Fourier analysis has been performed in the spatial domain, all along the
slit length used, for all the spectra and for the total duration of the
observations. We have detected a significant periodic spatial variations with
Fourier transform power peaks around 9-10 arcsec and at 4 arcsec. They
correspond to the scale of the mesogranulation structure and the width of the
supergranular boundary, respectively. For the first time, this provides
evidence for the existence of a meso-scale in the upper chromosphere, of the
same size as observed in the photosphere and lower chromosphere by earlier
studies. We find from the analysis that there seems to be no signature of any
temporal evolution associated with the mesogranules, at least not during our
observing period. This result suggests that the life time of mesogranules will
be several hours or more, which confirms the earlier findings. In addition, we
notice that the size (9-10 arcsec) of the mesocells appears to be the same in

some interesting applications in quantum information processing.

supersymmetric Pati-Salam model which yields an acceptable b-quark mass for
universal boundary conditions and mu>0 by modestly violating Yukawa unification
and leads to new shifted, new smooth, or standard-smooth hybrid inflation.
Inflation takes place along a ""semi-shifted"" classically flat direction on
which the U(1)_{B-L} gauge group remains unbroken. After the end of inflation,
U(1)_{B-L} breaks spontaneously and a network of local cosmic strings, which
contribute a small amount to the curvature perturbation, is produced. We show
that, in minimal supergravity, this ""semi-shifted"" inflationary scenario is
compatible with a recent fit to data which uses field-theory simulations of a
local string network. Taking into account the requirement of gauge unification,
we find that, for spectral index n_s=1, the predicted fractional contribution
f_{10} of strings to the temperature power spectrum at multipole l=10 is about
0.039. Also, for f_{10}=0.10, which is the best-fit value, we obtain that n_s
is about 1.0254. Spectral indices lower than about 0.98 are excluded and blue
spectra are slightly favored. Magnetic monopoles are not formed at the end of
semi-shifted hybrid inflation.

structure of its moments is presented. Then we focus on the geodesic evolution
of the Vlasov moments. As a first step, these moment equations generalize the
Camassa-Holm equation to its multi-component version. Subsequently, adding
electrostatic forces to the geodesic moment equations relates them to the
Benney equations and to the equations for beam dynamics in particle
accelerators. Next, we develop a kinetic theory for self assembly in
nano-particles. Darcy's law is introduced as a general principle for
aggregation dynamics in friction dominated systems (at different scales). Then,
a kinetic equation is introduced for the dissipative motion of isotropic
nano-particles. The zeroth-moment dynamics of this equation recovers the
classical Darcy's law at the macroscopic level. A kinetic-theory description
for oriented nano-particles is also presented. At the macroscopic level, the
zeroth moments of this kinetic equation recover the magnetization dynamics of
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The moment equations exhibit the
spontaneous emergence of singular solutions (clumpons) that finally merge in
one singularity. This behaviour represents aggregation and alignment of
oriented nano-particles. Finally, the Smoluchowski description is derived from
the dissipative Vlasov equation for anisotropic interactions. Various levels of
approximate Smoluchowski descriptions are proposed as special cases of the
general treatment. As a result, the macroscopic momentum emerges as an
additional dynamical variable that in general cannot be neglected.

  We explain why a consistent reformulation of causal inference in terms of
algorithmic complexity implies a new inference principle that takes into
account also the complexity of conditional probability densities, making it
possible to select among Markov equivalent causal graphs. This insight provides
a theoretical foundation of a heuristic principle proposed in earlier work.

complexity criteria. This can be seen as an algorithmic analog of replacing the
empirically undecidable question of statistical independence with practical
independence tests that are based on implicit or explicit assumptions on the

transport in designed micro-channels up to its prominent role for inducing
transport in molecular motors and Brownian motors. Here, Brownian transport is
studied in micro-sized, two dimensional periodic channels, exhibiting
periodically varying cross sections. The particles in addition are subjected to
an external force acting alongside the direction of the longitudinal channel
axis. For a fixed channel geometry, the dynamics of the two dimensional problem
is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter which is proportional to
the ratio of the applied force and the temperature of the particle environment.
In such structures entropic effects may play a dominant role. Under certain
conditions the two dimensional dynamics can be approximated by an effective one
dimensional motion of the particle in the longitudinal direction. The Langevin
equation describing this reduced, one dimensional process is of the type of the
Fick-Jacobs equation. It contains an entropic potential determined by the
varying extension of the eliminated channel direction, and a correction to the
diffusion constant that introduces a space dependent diffusion. Different forms
of this correction term have been suggested before, which we here compare for a
particular class of models. We analyze the regime of validity of the
Fick-Jacobs equation, both by means of analytical estimates and the comparisons
with numerical results for the full two dimensional stochastic dynamics. For
the nonlinear mobility we find a temperature dependence which is opposite to
that known for particle transport in periodic potentials. The influence of
entropic effects is discussed for both, the nonlinear mobility and the
effective diffusion constant.

entanglements may be explained by combined models of local and non-local hidden
variables. To the difference from previous works they considered models in
which each pair of entangled particles behaves in the same way, and the
particles in the pair are equivalent, i.e. each of them produces its response
to a measurement according to both local and non-local hidden variables. Their
article aimed at proving that the local hidden variable component in such
models has no effect on the measurement results, i.e. only the non-local
variables are relevant. However, their proof deals with a very restrictive case
and assumes questionable constraints on the hidden variables. The present text
studies the Colbeck and Renner class of models on a less restrictive case and
under no constraints on the hidden variables. It is shown again that the local
component cannot have any influence on the results. However, the Colbeck and
Renner class of models is not the only one possible. A different class is
described, and it admits local hidden variables by the side of the non-local
influence. This class presents a couple of advantages.

iron core. The dynamical collapse halts at $ t $ = 189 ms by the pressure of
high density gas and a proto-neutron star (PNS) forms. The evolution of PNS was
followed about 40 milli-seconds in typical models. When the initial rotation is
mildly fast and the initial magnetic fields are mildly strong, bipolar jets are
launched from an upper atmosphere ($ r \sim 60 {\rm km} $) of the PNS. The jets
are accelerated to $ \sim 3 \times 10 ^4 $ km s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to
the escape velocity at the foot point. The jets are parallel to the initial
rotation axis. Before the launch of the jets, magnetic fields are twisted by
rotation of the PNS. The twisted magnetic fields form torus-shape multi-layers
in which the azimuthal component changes alternately. The formation of magnetic
multi-layers is due to the initial condition in which the magnetic fields are

The t-channel ""single top"" is a relatively rare mode of top production but with

an unprecedented energy scale through the measurement of the top polarisation.
  Analysis strategies and computing tools were developed and tested
extensively. The study was performed using the signal and background events
modelled with Monte Carlo generators, many of which have been newly developed

performed to obtain realistic estimates of the sensitivity of the measurements.
A new fully fledged analysis framework, ""EventView"" was developed for the ATLAS
collaboration to process these data at the first level of analysis.
Parameterised vertex tagging was developed to estimate the level of background
for this analysis and a maximum likelihood fit was used for the precise
extraction of the top polarisation.

possible systematic errors, both experimental and theoretical, needs to be

an intriguing feature in low twist 2 or 3. The anomalous dimension of the
lowest state, dual a folded string on AdS_5 X S^5, can be computed by Bethe
Ansatz at 3, 4 loops respectively as a simple closed function of the Lorentz
spin. This feature is apparently lost at higher twist. We propose sum rules for
the excited anomalous dimensions where closed expressions can still be
provided, even at higher twist. We present several explicit three loop
examples. Many structural regularities can be observed leading to closed
expressions which depend parametrically both on the spin and the twist. They
allow to compute the subleading term in the logarithmic large spin expansion of
the sum rules as a compact simple function of the twist, in analogy with the
recent results by Freyhult, Rej and Staudacher in arXiv:0712.2743 [hep-th].

taking the ideal gas and the non-interacting harmonic oscillators as examples,
we show that, when the particle number N is large enough, the relative
fluctuation of the energy is proportional to 1/N in the new statistics, instead
of square root of 1/N in Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. Thus the equivalence
between the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble still holds in Tsallis
statistics.

that the main phase of LaO0.9F0.1FeAs was obtained by this synthesis method.
The transition temperature of the LaO0.9F0.1FeAs wire is around 25 K. The

Anderson localization, although it is related to a strongly dissipative
dynamics. Specifically, we study thermal convection in a horizontal porous
layer heated from below in the presence of a parametric disorder; physical
parameters of the layer are time-independent and randomly inhomogeneous in one
of the horizontal directions. Under such a frozen parametric disorder,
spatially localized flow patterns appear. We focus our study on their
localization properties and the effect of an imposed advection along the layer
on these properties. Our interpretation of the results of the linear theory is
underpinned by numerical simulation for the nonlinear problem. Weak advection
is found to lead to an upstream delocalization of localized current patterns.
Due to this delocalization, the transition from a set of localized patterns to
an almost everywhere intense ""global"" flow can be observed under conditions
where the disorder-free system would be not far below the instability
threshold. The results presented are derived for a physical system which is
mathematically described by a modified Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and
therefore they are expected to be relevant for a broad variety of dissipative
media where pattern selection occurs.

of quantum mechanics from a metageometric perspective, resulting from the
belief that geometric thought and language are powerless to farther
understanding of these issues, restricting instead physical progress.
  The nature and assumptions of quantum gravity are analysed critically,
including misgivings about the relevance of the Planck scale to it and its lack
of observational referent in the natural world.
  The anthropic foundations of geometry are investigated. The exclusive use of
geometric thought from antiquity to present-day physics is found to permeate
all new attempts towards better theories, including quantum gravity and, within
it, even pregeometry.
  The problem of the ether is found to have perpetuated itself up to the
present by transmuting its form from mechanical, through metric, to geometric.
  A clarification is made of the physical, mathematical, and psychological
foundations of relativity and quantum theories. The former is founded
geometrically on measurement-based clock-reading separations ds. The latter is
founded metageometrically on the experiment-based concepts of premeasurement
and transition things, inspired in the physically unexplored aspect of time as
a consciousness-related product. A concept of metageometric time is developed
and coordinate time t is recovered from it. Discovery of the connection between
quantum-mechanical metageometric time elements and general-relativistic clock
time elements ds is deemed necessary for a combined understanding of time.
  Time is conjectured to be the missing link between general relativity and
quantum mechanics.

as two isothermal spheres. In a wide binary, each galaxy possesses individual
tangential, nearly astroidal, caustics and roundish radial caustics. As the
separation of the binary is made smaller, the caustics undergo a sequence of
metamorphoses. The first metamorphosis occurs when the tangential caustics
merge to form a single six-cusped caustic, lying interior to the radial
caustics. At still smaller separations, the six-cusped caustic undergoes the
second metamorphosis and splits into a four-cusped caustic and two three-cusped
caustics, which shrink to zero size (an elliptic umbilic catastrophe) before
they enlarge again and move away from the origin perpendicular to the binary
axis. Finally, a third metamorphosis occurs as the three-cusp caustics join the
radial caustics, leaving an inner distorted astroid caustic enclosed by two
outer caustics. The maximum number of images possible is 7. Classifying the
multiple imaging according to critical isochrones, there are only 8
possibilities: 2 three-image cases, 3 five-image cases, and 3 seven-image
cases. When the isothermal spheres are singular, the core images vanish into
the central singularity. The number of images may then be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5,
depending on the source location, and the separation and masses of the pair of
lensing galaxies. The locations of metamorphoses, and the onset of threefold
and fivefold multiple imaging, can be worked out analytically in this case.

source to produce more than one Einstein ring. If two point masses (or two
isothermal spheres) in different planes are aligned with observer and source on
the optical axis, we show that there are up to three Einstein rings. We also
discuss the image morphologies for these two models if axisymmetry is broken,
