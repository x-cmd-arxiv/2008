to acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform

the holographic QCD by varying the anomalous dimension from $\gamma_m \simeq 0$
through $\gamma_m \simeq 1$ continuously. The $S$ parameter is given as a
positive monotonic function of $\xi$ which is fairly insensitive to $\gamma_m$
and continuously vanishes as $S \sim \xi^2 \to 0$ when $\xi \to 0$, where $\xi$
is the vacuum expectation value of the bulk scalar field at the infrared
boundary of the 5th dimension $z=z_m$ and is related to the mass of (techni-)
$\rho$ meson ($M_\rho$) and the decay constant ($f_\pi$) as $\xi \sim f_\pi z_m
\sim f_\pi/M_\rho$ for $\xi \ll 1$. However, although $\xi$ is related to the
techni-fermion condensate $\condense$, we find no particular suppression of
$\xi$ and hence of $S$ due to large $\gamma_m$, based on the correct
identification of the renormalization-point dependence of $\condense$ in
contrast to the literature. Then we argue possible behaviors of $f_\pi/M_\rho$
as $\condense \to 0$ near the conformal window characterized by the Banks-Zaks
infrared fixed point in more explicit dynamics with $\gamma_m \simeq 1$. It is
a curious coincidence that the result from ladder Schwinger-Dyson and
Bethe-Salpeter equations well fits in the parameter space obtained in this

possibility that $f_\pi$ vanishes much faster than the dynamical mass $m$ does.

featuring two coupled, interacting modes is analytically investigated within

cavity shapes and mode geometries. Closed-form coupled mode equations are
obtained for all classes of laser dynamics. We show that bistable operation is
possible in all of these classes. In the simplest case (class-A lasers)
bistability is shown to result from an interplay between coherent
(population-pulsation) and incoherent (hole-burning) processes of mode
interaction. We find that microcavities offer better conditions to achieve
bistable lasing than bulk cavities, especially if the modes are not degenerate
in frequency. This results from better matching of the spatial intensity
distribution of microcavity modes. In more complicated laser models (class-B

frequency than in the class-A case. The predictions of the coupled mode theory
have been confirmed using numerical finite-difference time-domain calculations.

designed to reduce the statistical noise and, hence, to allow for the study of
the inner chemical structure of objects with moderately high numbers of
particles; ii) the full dependence of metal production on the detailed chemical
composition of stellar particles by using, for the first time in SPH codes, the
Qij matrix formalism that relates each nucleosynthetic product to its sources;
and iii) the full dependence of radiative cooling on the detailed chemical
composition of gas particles, achieved through a fast algorithm using a new
metallicity parameter zeta(T) that gives the weight of each element on the
total cooling function. The resolution effects and the results obtained from
this SPH chemical model have been tested by comparing its predictions in
different problems with known theoretical solutions. We also present some
preliminary results on the chemical properties of elliptical galaxies found in
self-consistent cosmological simulations. Such simulations show that the above
zeta-cooling method is important to prevent an overestimation of the
metallicity-dependent cooling rate, whereas the Qij formalism is important to
prevent a significant underestimation of the [alpha/Fe] ratio in simulated

to the addition of local correlation effects. Current estimates regarding the
order of the two orbital complexes range from -200 meV to 315 meV in therms of

calculations of this one-electron splitting \Delta= \epsilon_a1g-\epsilon_e_g'
for the full two-layer compound, Na2xCo2O4, accounting for the effects of Na
ordering, interplanar interactions and octahedral distortion. We find that
\epsilon a_1g-\epsilon e_g' is negative for all Na fillings and that this is
primarily due to the strongly positive Coulomb field created by Na+ ions in the
intercalant plane. This field disproportionately affects the a_1g orbital which
protrudes farther upward from the Co plane than the e_g' orbitals. We discuss
also the secondary effects of octahedral compression and multi-orbital filling
on the value of \Delta as a function of Na content. Our results indicate that
if the e_g' pockets are indeed suppressed that can only be due to nonlocal
correlation effects beyond the standard DMFT.

for the construction of quasi-equilibrium binaries with a spinning black hole.
Second, we construct binaries in low-eccentricity orbits, which are a better

making the Yukawa couplings between each fermion and its respective Higgs boson

is a variety of scalars which could be probed at future collider experiments

the dark matter sector of the Private Higgs model. We first calculate the
annihilation cross sections of dark matter in this model and find that one can
easily account for the observed density of dark matter in the Universe with
relatively natural values of the model's parameters. Finally, we investigate
the possibility of detecting Private Higgs dark matter indirectly via the
observation of anomalous gamma rays originating from the galactic halo. We show
that a substantial flux of photons can be produced from the annihilation of
Private Higgs dark matter such that, if there is considerable clumping of dark
matter in the galactic halo, the flux of these gamma rays could be observed by
ground-based telescope arrays such as VERITAS and HESS.

simulating the formation of a galaxy in its proper cosmological framework,
focusing on the ability of the model to form a disk-like structure in
rotational support. We find that SN feedback plays a fundamental role in the
evolution of the simulated galaxy, efficiently regulating the star formation
activity, pressurizing the gas and generating mass-loaded galactic winds. These
processes affect several galactic properties such as final stellar mass,
morphology, angular momentum, chemical properties, and final gas and baryon
fractions. In particular, we find that our model is able to reproduce extended
disk components with high specific angular momentum and a significant fraction
of young stars. The galaxies are also found to have significant spheroids
composed almost entirely of stars formed at early times. We find that most
combinations of the input parameters yield disk-like components, although with
different sizes and thicknesses, indicating that the code can form disks
without fine-tuning the implemented physics. We also show how our model scales
to smaller systems. By analysing simulations of virial masses 10^9 M_sun/h and
10^10 M_sun/h, we find that the smaller the galaxy, the stronger the SN

Observatory observations of Abell 85, Abell 754 and the background cluster
Abell 89B out to their virial radii. Out of seventeen X-ray sources associated
with galaxies in these clusters, we classify seven as X-ray AGN with L_{X,B} >
10^{41} erg/s. Only two of these would be classified as AGN based on their
optical spectra. We combine these observations with archival data to create a
sample of X-ray AGN from six z < 0.08 clusters and find that 3.4+1.1/-0.8% of
M_R < -20 galaxies host X-ray AGN with L_{X,B} > 10^{41} erg/s. We find that
more X-ray AGN are detected in more luminous galaxies and attribute this to
larger spheriods in more luminous galaxies and increased sensitivity to lower
Eddington-rate accretion from black holes in those spheroids. At a given X-ray
luminosity limit, more massive black holes can be accreting less efficiently,
yet still be detected. If interactions between galaxies are the principal
drivers of AGN activity, then the AGN fraction should be higher in lower
velocity dispersion clusters and the outskirts of clusters. However, the
tendency of the most massive and early-type galaxies to lie in the centers of
the richest clusters could dilute such trends. While we find no variation in
the AGN fraction with projected cluster-centric radius, we do find that the AGN
fraction increases significantly from 2.6+1.0/-0.8% in rich clusters to
10.0+6.2/-4.3% in those with lower velocity dispersions.

spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions (analogous to the corresponding case in
quantum electrodynamics) and these effects are shown to manifest themselves in
two ways: (a) precession of the spinning bodies per se and (b) precession of
the orbit (which is further broke down into precessions of the argument of the
periastron, the longitude of the ascending node and the inclination of the
orbit). We also note the ambiguity that arises from use of the terminology
frame-dragging, de Sitter precession and Lense-Thirring precession, in contrast
to the unambiguous reference to spin-orbit and spin-spin precessions. Turning
to one-body experiments, we discuss the recent results of the GP-B experiment,
the Ciufolini-Pavlis Lageos experiment and lunar-laser ranging measurements

astronomical observations and we survey results obtained from the first binary

means to measure the post-shock proton velocity distribution. While most
analyses assume a Maxwellian velocity distribution, this is unlikely to be
correct. In particular, neutral atoms that pass through the shock and become
ionized downstream form a nonthermal distribution similar to that of pickup
ions in the solar wind. We predict the H alpha line profiles from the
combination of pickup protons and the ordinary shocked protons, and we consider
the extent to which this distribution could affect the shock parameters derived
from H alpha profiles. The Maxwellian assumption could lead to an underestimate
of shock speed by up to about 15%. The isotropization of the pickup ion
population generates wave energy, and we find that for the most favorable
parameters this energy could significantly heat the thermal particles.
Sufficiently accurate profiles could constrain the strength and direction of
the magnetic field in the shocked plasma, and we discuss the distortions from a
Gaussian profile to be expected in Tycho's supernova remnant.

  pages",,,,"q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that the impact of transactions on stock price (market impact) is
a concave function of the size of the order, but there exists little
quantitative theory that suggests why this is so. I develop a quantitative
theory for the market impact of hidden orders (orders that reflect the true
intention of buying and selling) that matches the empirically measured result
and that reproduces some of the non-trivial and universal properties of stock
returns (returns are percent changes in stock price). The theory is based on a
simple premise, that the stock market can be modeled in a mechanical way - as a
device that translates order flow into an uncorrelated price stream. Given that
order flow is highly autocorrelated, this premise requires that market impact
(1) depends on past order flow and (2) is asymmetric for buying and selling. I
derive the specific form for the dependence in (1) by assuming that current
liquidity responds to information about all currently active hidden orders
(liquidity is a measure of the price response to a transaction of a given
size). This produces an equation that suggests market impact should scale
logarithmically with total order size. Using data from the London Stock
Exchange I empirically measure market impact and show that the result matches
the theory. Also using empirical data, I qualitatively specify the asymmetry of
(2). Putting all results together, I form a model for market impact that
reproduces three universal properties of stock returns - that returns are
uncorrelated, that returns are distributed with a power law tail, and that the
magnitude of returns is highly autocorrelated (also known as clustered
volatility).

observations of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in four late-type,
actively star forming edge-on spirals, obtained with ACS on-board HST. Our
F658N (H-alpha) observations reveal a multitude of structures on both small and
large scales. Whereas all four galaxies have been studied with ground-based
telescopes before, here the small scale structure of the extended emission line
gas is presented for the first time at a spatial resolution of 0.05"",
corresponding to 5.0 pc at the mean distance to the target galaxies. The eDIG
morphology is very different for all four targets, probably as a result of
their different levels of star formation activity. We find that the morphology
of the eDIG, in particular the break-up of diffuse emission into filaments in
galaxy halos, shows a strong dependence on the level of star formation activity
per unit area, and eDIG can be arranged into a morphological sequence. NGC4634
and NGC5775 have the highest SF rate per unit area in our sample and the
observed morphology suggests that the break-up of the smooth eDIG layer into
individual resolved filaments occurs only above a certain threshold of SF
activity per unit area. Combined with ground-based data for samples that span a
larger range of galaxy mass our results indicate that the gravitational
potential also plays an important role in the eDIG morphology. In low-mass
galaxies the gas can be expelled due to shallow gravitational potentials more
easily and couple with strong star formation driven outflows on a local scale.
This is in contrast to the more massive galaxies, which show smooth eDIG
layers, unless they are powered by a superwind, as in the case of nucleated
starburst galaxies.

cuprates remains one of the fundamental unsolved problems in high temperature
superconductivity. Whether and how these two phenomena are interdependent is
perhaps most sharply seen in the stripe phases of various copper-oxide
materials. These phases, involving a mixture of spin and charge density waves,
do not yet admit a complete, overarching theoretical treatment. However aspects
of this problem can be analyzed. In this work, we focus on the magnetic side of
stripe physics. To this end, we study a simple model of a stripe-ordered phase
consisting of an array of alternating coupled doped and undoped two-leg
Hubbard-like ladders. To obtain the magnetic response, we employ already
available dynamical susceptibilities of the individual two-leg ladders and
treat the interladder coupling in a random phase approximation. Strikingly, we
find two possible scenarios for the ordered state induced by the coupling
between ladders: the spin modulation can occur either along or perpendicular to
the direction of the stripes. These two scenarios are differentiated according
to different microscopic realizations of the component doped ladders. However
inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the two stripe ordered cuprates,
La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_4 and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4, do not readily distinguish
between these two scenarios due to manner in which stripes form in these
materials.

distribution in the independence networks for both two types of nodes. In order
to understand the scale-free property of actors in dependence networks, two
growing bipartite models without the preferential attachment principle are
proposed. The models show the scale-free phenomena in actors' degree
distribution. It also gives well qualitatively consistent behavior with the
empirical results.

only 10% of the ICRF sources are suitable to establish this link, either
because they are not bright enough at optical wavelengths or because they have
significant extended radio emission which precludes reaching the highest

excellent detection rate of 89% is found, which is very promising for the

pedestrian dynamics. Except for the special case when there are no obstacles in
a concave scenario -- i.e. each position is visible from any other -- the
calculation of these distances is a non-trivial task. This isn't that big a
problem, as long as the model only demands the distances to be stored in a
Static Floor Field also called Potential Field, which never changes throughout
the whole simulation. In this case a pre-calculation once before the simulation
starts is sufficient. But if one wants to allow changes of the geometry during
a simulation run -- imagine doors or the blocking of a corridor due to some
hazard -- in the Distance Potential Field, calculation time matters strongly.
This contribution gives an overview over existing and new exact and approximate
methods to calculate a potential field, analytical investigations for their
exactness, and tests of their computation speed. The advantages and drawbacks

inhomogeneity length scale. When the results of the present analytic seismic
inversion are compared with those of a previous numerical inversion, excellent
agreement is found up to the point that the analytic seismic inversion emerges

The investigation is focused on the effect of its position and shape on
aerodynamics performances of a given V flight formation. Vortices generated the
wing tip of the leader moves downstream forming a pair of opposite rotating
line vortices. These vortices are generally undesirable because they create a
downwash that increases the induced drag on leaders wing. However, this
downwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the followers
wing flying behind the leaders one, namely a favorable lift for the followers
wing. How much contributions of the leaders wing to the followers wing in the V
formation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the
leaders wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence
angle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of
aerodynamic performances of the V flight formation including lift, drag and
moment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier Stokes equations
with k e turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock
topology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V flight formation.

equation has the particularity that in addition to an unbounded operator acting
on the Y-component of the solution there is still another one acting on the

  By using information-theoretic arguments, we prove a lower bound
$(1-\epsilon) \frac n{\pi}$ on the energy cost of any feasible solution for
this problem. Then, we provide an efficient solution of energy cost not larger
than $1.1204 \frac n{\pi}$.
  Finally, we present a fully-distributed protocol that constructs a broadcast
range assignment of energy cost not larger than $8n$,thus still yielding
constant approximation. The energy load is well balanced and, at the same time,
the work complexity (i.e. the energy due to all message transmissions of the
protocol) is asymptotically optimal. The completion time of the protocol is
only an $O(\log n)$ factor slower than the optimum. The approximation quality
of our distributed solution is also experimentally evaluated.
  All bounds hold with probability at least $1-1/n^{\Theta(1)}$.

to deal with ballistic conductance in metal nanowires. The spectra calculated
for normal emission in Cu(001) and Cu(111) are in fair agreement with previous
theoretical results and with experiments, including a newly determined
spectrum. The residual discrepancies between our results and the latter are
mainly due to the well-known deficiencies of density-functional theory in
accounting for correlation effects in quasi-particle spectra. A significant
improvement is obtained by the LDA+U method. Further improvements are obtained
by including surface-optics corrections, as described by Snell's law and
Fresnel's equations.

summarizing our current knowledge about the low energy neutrino mass matrix we
consider reconstructing the see-saw mechanism. Low energy neutrino physics is
not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu
-> e gamma, tau -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma the latter one has the largest
branching ratio in (i) SO(10) type I see-saw models and in (ii) scenarios in
which the triplet term dominates in the neutrino mass matrix.

what are the concepts behind the notion of recycled systems, and of activation

anisotropic local pressure in the fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, both for the Bjorken boost-invariant case and for the azimuthally
symmetric radial expansion with boost-invariance. The resulting increase of the
entropy can be counterbalanced by a suitable retuning of the initial
temperature. An increase of the transverse collective flow is observed. The
influence of the shear viscosity on the longitudinal expansion is also studied.
Viscosity reduces the cooling rate from the longitudinal work and counteracts
the pressure gradients that accelerate the longitudinal flow.
