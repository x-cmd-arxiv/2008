two-point functions in N_f-flavour QCD, in the presence of an isospin chemical
potential and at fixed gauge-field topology. We obtain these results at second
order in the \epsilon-expansion of Chiral Perturbation Theory and evaluate all
relevant zero-mode group integrals analytically. The virtue of working with a
non-vanishing chemical potential is that it provides the correlation functions
with a dependence on both the chiral condensate, \Sigma, and the pion decay
constant, F, already at leading order. Our results may therefore be useful for
improving the determination of these constants from lattice QCD calculations.
As a side product, we rectify an earlier calculation of the O(\epsilon^2)
finite-volume correction to the decay constant appearing in the partition
function. We also compute a generalised partition function which is useful for
evaluating U(N_f) group integrals.

the hot intracluster gas is efficiently heated by active galactic nucleus (AGN)

highly reduced compared to those predicted by the standard cooling flow models.
We perform a global Lagrangian stability analysis. We show for the first time
that the global radial instability in cool core clusters can be suppressed by
the AGN feedback mechanism, provided that the feedback efficiency exceeds a
critical lower limit. Furthermore, our analysis naturally shows that the
clusters can exist in two distinct forms. Globally stable clusters are expected
to have either: 1) cool cores stabilized by both AGN feedback and conduction,
or 2) non-cool cores stabilized primarily by conduction. Intermediate central
temperatures typically lead to globally unstable solutions. This bimodality is
consistent with the recently observed anticorrelation between the flatness of
the temperature profiles and the AGN activity (Dunn & Fabian 2008) and the
observation by Rafferty et al. (2008) that the shorter central cooling times
tend to correspond to significantly younger AGN X-ray cavities.

vertex is motivated from Lorentz and gauge invariance and the non-relativistic
interpretations of the neutrino gravitational form factors are obtained. We
comment on the renormalization conditions, the preservation of the weak
equivalence principle and the definition of the neutrino mass radius. We
associate the neutrino gravitational form factors with specific angular
momentum states. Based on Feynman diagrams, spin-statistics, CP invariance and
symmetries of the angular momentum states in the neutrino-graviton vertex, we
deduce differences between the Majorana and Dirac cases. It is then proved that
in spite of the theoretical differences between the two cases, as far as
experiments are considered, they would be virtually indistinguishable for any
space-time geometry satisfying the weak field condition. We then calculate the
transition gravitational form factors for the neutrino by evaluating the
relevant Feynman diagrams at 1-loop and estimate a neutrino transition mass
radius. The form factor is seen to depend on the momentum transfer very weakly.
It is also seen that the neutrino transition mass radius is smaller than the
typical neutrino charge radius by a couple of orders of magnitude.

varying number ratio, that correspond to disk and halo. The two components also
possess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. The metallicity of the
halo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicity
smoothly decreases with distance from the Galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to
-0.8 beyond several kpc. The absence of a correlation between metallicity and
kinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional decomposition
in terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent substructures in the
kinematics--metallicity space, such as the Monoceros stream, which rotates
faster than the LSR, and has a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.96, with an rms

when the original N=2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=1 by bulk
fluxes. From the underlying classical N=2 supergravity, the theory inherits a
shift symmetry which provides the inflaton with a naturally flat potential. We
analyze the fate of this shift symmetry after the inclusion of quantum
corrections. The field range of the inflaton is found to depend significantly
on the complex structure of the torus but is independent of its volume. This
allows for a large kinematical field range for the inflaton. Furthermore, we
show that the D3/D7 model may lead to a realization of the recent CMB fit by
Hindmarsh et al. with an 11% contribution from cosmic strings and a spectral
index close to n_s=1. On the other hand, by a slight change of the parameters
of the model one can strongly suppress the cosmic string contribution and
reduce the spectral index n_s to fit the WMAP5 data in the absence of cosmic

Waldhausen and was developed later through work of Jaco, Shalen and Johansen.
It was shown that there is a finite collection of 2-sided, incompressible tori
that separate a given closed irreducible 3-manifold into pieces with strong
topological structure. Sela introduced the idea of JSJ-decompositions for
groups, an idea that has flourished in a variety of directions. The general
idea is to consider a certain class X of groups and splittings of groups in X
by groups in another class Y. E.g. Rips and Sela considered splittings of
finitely presented groups by infinite cyclic groups. For an arbitrary group G
in X the goal is to produce a unique graph of groups decomposition T of G with
edge groups in Y so that T reveals all graph of groups decompositions of G with
edge groups in Y. More specifically, if V is a vertex group of T then either
there is no Y-group that splits both G and V, or V has a special ""surface
group-like"" structure. It is standard to call vertex groups of the second type
""orbifold groups"". For a finitely generated Coxeter system (W,S) we produce a
reduced JSJ-decomposition T for splittings of W over virtually abelian
subgroups. We show T is unique with each vertex and edge group generated by a
subset of S (and so T is ""visual""). The construction of T is algorithmic. If V,

routing problem called the ring star problem. It consists of locating a simple
cycle through a subset of nodes of a graph while optimizing two kinds of cost.
The first objective is the minimization of a ring cost that is related to the
length of the cycle. The second one is the minimization of an assignment cost
from non-visited nodes to visited ones. In spite of its obvious bi-objective
formulation, this problem has always been investigated in a single-objective
way. To tackle the bi-objective ring star problem, we first investigate
different stand-alone search methods. Then, we propose two cooperative
strategies that combines two multiple objective metaheuristics: an elitist
evolutionary algorithm and a population-based local search. We apply this new
hybrid approaches to well-known benchmark test instances and demonstrate their
effectiveness in comparison to non-hybrid algorithms and to state-of-the-art
methods.

been isolated: hyperlinear groups and sofic groups. They come from different
corners of mathematics (operator algebras and symbolic dynamics, respectively),
and were introduced independently from each other, but are closely related
nevertheless.
  Hyperlinear groups have their origin in Connes' Embedding Conjecture about
von Neumann factors of type $II_1$, while sofic groups, introduced by Gromov,
are motivated by Gottschalk Surjunctivity Conjecture (can a shift $A^G$ contain
a proper isomorphic copy of itself, where $A$ is a finite discrete space and
$G$ is a group?).
  Groups from both classes can be characterized as subgroups of metric
ultraproducts of families of certain metric groups (formed in the same way as
ultraproducts of Banach spaces): unitary groups of finite rank lead to
hyperlinear groups, symmetric groups of finite rank - to sofic groups.
  We offer an introductory guide to some of the main concepts, results, and
sources of the theory, following Connes, Gromov, Benjamin Weiss, Kirchberg,
Ozawa, Radulescu, Elek and Szab\'o, and others, and discuss open questions
which are for the time being perhaps more numerous than the results.

research and potential applications in quantum optics. Conventionally, it has
become a standard technique to produce the nonclassical light through the
nonlinear optical processes occurring in nonlinear crystals. In this review we
describe using cold atomic-gas media to generate such nonclassical light,
especially focusing on narrow-band biphoton generation. Compared with the
standard procedure, the new biphoton source has such properties as long
coherence time, long coherence length, high spectral brightness, and high
conversion efficiency. In this paper we concentrate on the theoretical aspect
of the entangled two-photon state produced from the four-wave mixing in a
multilevel atomic ensemble. We show that both linear and nonlinear optical
responses to the generated fields play an important role in determining the
biphoton waveform and, consequently on the two-photon temporal correlation.
There are two characteristic regimes determined by whether the linear or
nonlinear coherence time is dominant. In addition, our model provides a clear
physical picture that brings insight into understanding biphoton optics with
this new source. We apply our model to recent work on generating narrow-band
(and even subnatural linewidth) paired photons using the technique of
electromagnetically induced transparency and slow-light effect in cold atoms,

thus combine techniques of computational geometry with Shor's r-algorithm to
produce a sequence that converges to the maximum likelihood estimate. For the
moderate or large sample sizes in our simulations, the maximum likelihood
estimator is shown to provide an improvement in performance compared with
kernel-based methods, even when we allow the use of a theoretical, optimal
fixed bandwidth for the kernel estimator that would not be available in

the attractive Hubbard model as a prototype. The superfluid order parameter,
and fluctuations thereof, are implemented by a bosonic Hubbard-Stratonovich
field, which splits into two components corresponding to longitudinal and
transverse (Goldstone) fluctuations. Physical properties of the system are
computed from a set of approximate flow equations obtained by truncating the
exact functional renormalization group flow of the coupled fermion-boson
action. The equations capture the influence of fluctuations on non-universal
quantities such as the fermionic gap, as well as the universal infrared
asymptotics present in every fermionic superfluid. We solve the flow equations
numerically in two dimensions and compute the asymptotic behavior analytically
in two and three dimensions. The fermionic gap \Delta is reduced significantly
compared to the mean-field gap, and the bosonic order parameter \alpha, which
is equivalent to \Delta in mean-field theory, is suppressed to values below
\Delta by fluctuations. The fermion-boson vertex is only slightly renormalized.
In the infrared regime, transverse order parameter fluctuations associated with
the Goldstone mode lead to a strong renormalization of longitudinal
fluctuations: the longitudinal mass and the bosonic self-interaction vanish
linearly as a function of the scale in two dimensions, and logarithmically in
three dimensions, in agreement with the exact behavior of an interacting Bose
gas.

source-surface model to calculate the magnetic topology of a small bipolar

common in closed-field regions close to the solar equator, bald patches are
unlikely to occur in the open-field topology of a coronal hole. Our results
give rise to the following question: What happens to a bald patch topology when
the surrounding field lines open up? This would be the case when a bald patch
moves into a coronal hole, or when a coronal hole forms in an area that
encompasses a bald patch. Our magnetostatic models show that, in this case, the
bald patch topology almost invariably transforms into a null point topology
with a spine and a fan. We argue that the time-dependent evolution of this
scenario will be very dynamic since the change from a bald patch to null point
topology cannot occur via a simple ideal evolution in the corona. We discuss
the implications of these findings for recent Hinode XRT observations of
coronal hole jets and give an outline of planned time-dependent 3D MHD
simulations to fully assess this scenario.

the model undergoes a first-order collapsing transition between the smooth

history has been the emergence of a well-populated red sequence of
non-star-forming galaxies. A number of models of galaxy formation and evolution
have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior. Most current models
require feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star
formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central
galaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central
galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a
prominent bulge component). I show using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
that the observations are consistent with this prediction. Over 99.5% of red
sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10^{10} M_{\sun} have a
prominent bulge component (as defined by having a Sersic index n above 1.5).
Those very rare red sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge (n<1.5)
usually have detectable star formation or AGN activity; the fraction of truly
quenched bulgeless central galaxies is <0.1% of the total red sequence
population. I conclude that a bulge, and by implication a supermassive black
hole, is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in
central galaxies. This is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the
AGN feedback paradigm.

Bayesian inference to optimise adaptive pixelisation of the source plane and to

the power law with a volume mass density that scales as r^(-1.96+/-0.02) and an

suffer substantial contamination from normal galaxies. X-ray stacking analysis
reveals a soft mean X-ray spectrum for these sources, consistent with
Gamma~2.1. This suggests that star-forming galaxies and not obscured AGN
dominate the stacked signal. In contrast AGN selection methods that combine
mid-infrared with optical criteria are more successful in finding heavily
obscured AGN candidates. A method similar to the one proposed by Fiore et al.
(2008) is adopted to select extremely red objects (R-[3.6]>3.7mag) with high
24micron to optical flux ratio (f_24/f_R>1000). About 80% of these sources are
not detected at X-ray wavelengths. Stacking the X-ray photons at the positions
of these sources shows a flat mean X-ray spectrum (Gamma~0.8), which suggests
Compton-thick sources, low-luminosity and moderately obscured (N_H~8e22) AGN,
or a combination of the two. The mid-infrared colours and luminosities of these

surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, where the
suppression of conductivity is a result of interactions and not the consequence
of a filled Bloch band. The proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic
systems is the origin for many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter
physics, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore it is
highly desirable to use the novel experimental tools developed in atomic
physics to access this regime. Indeed, the Hubbard model, which encompasses the
essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped
in an optical lattice. However, the Mott insulating regime has so far been
reached only with a gas of bosons, lacking the rich and peculiar nature of
fermions. Here we report on the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively
interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is signalled by
three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a
strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double
occupancy to atom number increase, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the
excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to
compare the Mott insulating and the non-interacting regime without changing
tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of
the Mott insulator, including spin ordering and ultimately the question of
d-wave superfluidity.

analyzed with numerical calculations of current-density distributions and
Oersted fields in typical contact geometries. For the Oersted field
calculation, a hybrid finite element / boundary element method (FEM/BEM)
technique is presented which can be applied to samples of arbitrary shape.
Based on the FEM/BEM analysis, it is argued that reliable micromagnetic
simulations on spin-tranfer-torque driven magnetization processes should
include precise calculations of the Oersted field, particularly in the case of
pillar contact geometries. Similarly, finite-element simulations demonstrate
that numerical calculations of current-density distributions are required,
e.g., in the case of magnetic strips with an indentation. Such strips are
frequently used for the design of devices based on current-driven domain-wall
motion. A dramatic increase of the current density is found at the apex of the
notch, which is expected to strongly affect the magnetization processes in such
strips.

of background. We consider the case where a primary experiment yields a
realization of the signal plus background, and a second experiment yields a
realization of the background. The data acquisitions times for the
background-only experiment,T_bg, and the primary experiment,T, are selected so
that their ratio varies from 1 to 25. The expected number of background counts
in the primary experiment varies from 0.2 to 2. We construct 90 and 95 percent
confidence intervals based on a propagation-of-errors method as well as two
implementations of a Neyman procedure where acceptance regions are constructed
based on a likelihood-ratio criterion that automatically determines whether the
resulting confidence interval is one-sided or two-sided. The first Neyman
procedure (due to Feldman and Cousins) neglects uncertainty in the background.
In the other Neyman procedure, we account for uncertainty in the background
with a parametric bootstrap method. We also construct minimum length Bayesian
credibility intervals. For each method, we test for the presence of a signal
based on the value of the lower endpoint of the uncertainty interval. When
T_bg/T is 5 or more and the expected background is 2 or less, the Feldman
Cousins method outperforms the other methods considered.

important for consistency of a gauge theory, i.e., unitarity and Ward identity
of physical amplitudes. We find that non-integrable singularities arise in
physical quantities like cross section and decay rate from gauge interactions
of unparticles. We also show that Ward identity is violated due to the lack of
a dispersion relation for charged unparticles although the Ward-Takahashi
identity for general Green functions is incorporated in the model. A previous
observation that the unparticle's (with scaling dimension d) contribution to
the gauge boson self-energy is a factor (2-d) of the particle's has been
extended to the Green function of triple gauge bosons. This (2-d) rule may be
generally true for any point Green functions of gauge bosons. This implies that
the model would be trivial even as one that mimics certain dynamical effects on
gauge bosons in which unparticles serve as an interpolating field.

symmetric system. Motivited by real multiprocessor systems, we investigate
architectures that exhibit limited asymmetry: there are two essentially
different speeds. Interestingly, this special case has not been studied in the
field of parallel computing and scheduling theory; only the general case was
studied where processors have $K$ essentially different speeds. We present the
non-preemptive algorithm ``Remnants'' that achieves almost optimal makespan. We
provide a refined analysis of a recent scheduling method. Based on this

Cygni-type profile from H_gamma through H_23 are revealed in the violet spectra
of BM Gem, a carbon star associated with an oxygen-rich circumstellar shell
(`silicate carbon star') observed with the high dispersion spectrograph (HDS)
on the Subaru telescope. The blue-shifted absorption in the Balmer lines
indicates the presence of an outflow, the line of sight velocity of which is at
least 400 km s^-1, which is the highest outflow velocity observed to date in a
carbon star. We argue that the observed unusual features in BM Gem are strong
evidence for the presence of a companion, which should form an accretion disk
that gives rise to both an ionized gas region and a high velocity, variable
outflow. The estimated luminosity of ~0.2 (0.03-0.6) L_sun for the ionized gas
can be maintained by a mass accretion rate to a dwarf companion of ~10^-8 M_sun
yr^-1, while ~10^-10 M_sun yr^-1 is sufficient for accretion to a white dwarf
companion. These accretion rates are feasible for some detached binary
configurations on the basis of the Bond-Hoyle type accretion process. We
concluded that the carbon star BM Gem is in a detached binary system with a
companion of low mass and low luminosity. However, we are unable to determine
whether this companion object is a dwarf or a white dwarf. The upper limits for
binary separation are 210 AU and 930 AU for a dwarf and a white dwarf,
respectively. We also note that the observed features of BM Gem mimic those of
Mira (omi Cet), which may suggest actual similarities in their binary
configurations and circumstellar structures.

parallel propagating ion acoustic waves. However, although the past study
argued that such parallel propagating longitudinal waves are excited by
transverse modulation of parent Alfven wave, we consider these waves are more
likely to be generated by the usual, parallel decay instability. Further, we
performed other simulation runs with different polarization of the parent
Alfven waves or the different ion thermal velocity. Numerical results suggest
that the electron heating by the modified two stream instability due to the
large amplitude Alfven waves is unimportant with most parameter sets.

asymptotics holds with probability close to 1 for small random perturbations of

magnetic field to relax through a quasistatic sequence of nonaxisymmetric,

from a random field. Under the hypothesis that the force-free modes approach
energy equipartition in the absence of resistivity, the output of the numerical

linked poloidal-toroidal configuration, which inflates and becomes more
toroidal as time passes. A qualitatively similar (but not identical) end state
is reached if the magnetic field evolves by exchanging helicity between small

arising from the fluctuating electromotive force produced by the initial random

recently installed at ESO's VLT, together with state-of-the-art model
atmospheres and synthetic spectra. This represents the first fluorine abundance
measurement in a Galactic Bulge star, and one of few measurements of this kind
in a third dredge-up oxygen-rich AGB star. The F abundance is found to be close
to the solar value scaled down to the metallicity of the star, and in agreement
with Disk giants that are comparable to the Bulge giant studied here. The
measurement is of astrophysical interest also because the star's mass can be
estimated rather accurately ($1.4 \lesssim M/\mathrm{M}_{\sun} \lesssim 2.0$).
AGB nucleosynthesis models predict only a very mild enrichment of F in such low
mass AGB stars. Thus, we suggest that the fluorine abundance found in the
studied star is representative for the star's natal cloud, and that fluorine
must have been produced at a similar level in the Bulge and in the Disk.

measure cosmological parameters with ever greater precision. However this
increased accuracy also places greater demands on the statistical tools used to
extract the available information. To date, the majority of lensing analyses
use the two point-statistics of the cosmic shear field. These can either be
studied directly using the two-point correlation function, or in Fourier space,
using the power spectrum. But analyzing weak lensing data inevitably involves
the masking out of regions or example to remove bright stars from the field.
Masking out the stars is common practice but the gaps in the data need proper
handling. In this paper, we show how an inpainting technique allows us to
properly fill in these gaps with only $N \log N$ operations, leading to a new
image from which we can compute straight forwardly and with a very good
accuracy both the pow er spectrum and the bispectrum. We propose then a new
method to compute the bispectrum with a polar FFT algorithm, which has the main
advantage of avoiding any interpolation in the Fourier domain. Finally we
propose a new method for dark matter mass map reconstruction from shear
observations which integrates this new inpainting concept. A range of examples
based on 3D N-body simulations illustrates the results.

dynamics of immune responses to persistent viruses. Science 272, 74-79) from a
mesoscopic description. In its final form the model can be written as a set of
Volterra integrodifferential equations. We consider the role of age-distributed
delays for death times and the intracellular (eclipse) phase. These processes
are implemented by means of probability distribution functions. The basic
reproductive ratio $R_0$ of the infection is properly defined in terms of such
distributions by using an analysis of the equilibrium states and their
stability. It is concluded that the introduction of distributed delays can
strongly modify both the value of $R_0$ and the predictions for the virus

also show how the model presented here can be applied to some simple situations

phage-bacteria interactions are analysed. The dynamics of the eclipse phase for

the source, while the continuum part of the spectrum depends on the phase
relatively weakly. The cyclotron lines turned out to be very nonequidistant.

physical conditions in the active regions of the source, under which a

slightly better in almost all examples we studied. We also discuss how several
types of trends affect the different types of DFA. For weak trends in the data,
the new methods are comparable with DFA in these respects. However, if the
functional form of the trend in data is not a-priori known, DFA remains the
method of choice. Only a comparison of DFA results, using different detrending

to a positive or negative value of the curvature. Subsequently, we move on to
geodesic flows on two dimensional spaces with varying curvature. As an example,
we discuss flows on a torus, where interesting oscillatory features of the
expansion, shear and rotation emerge, which are found to depend on the ratio of
the radii of the torus. The singular (within a finite time)/non--singular

abnormally weighting type of energy. This theory of tensor-scalar anomalous
gravity is based on a relaxation of the weak equivalence principle that is now
restricted to ordinary visible matter only. As a consequence, the convergence
mechanism toward general relativity is modified and produces naturally cosmic
acceleration as an inescapable gravitational feedback induced by the
mass-variation of some invisible sector. The cosmological implications of this
new theoretical framework are studied. From the Hubble diagram cosmological
test \textit{alone}, this theory provides an estimation of the amount of
baryons and dark matter in the Universe that is consistent with the independent
cosmological tests of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Cosmic coincidence is naturally achieved from a equally
natural assumption on the amplitude of the scalar coupling strength. Finally,
from the adequacy to supernovae data, we derive a new intriguing relation
between the space-time dependences of the gravitational coupling and the dark
matter mass, providing an example of crucial constraint on microphysics from
cosmology. This glimpses at an enticing new symmetry between the visible and
invisible sectors, namely that the scalar charges of visible and invisible
matter are exactly opposite.

investigate the evolution of the fraction, the radial distribution, the
distribution of mass ratios and periods of the binary population. According to
these simulations, the fraction of surviving binaries appears to be dominated
by the processes of binary ionization and evaporation. In particular, the
frequency of binary systems changes by a factor 1-5 depending on the initial
conditions and on the assumed initial distribution of periods. The comparison
with the existing estimates of binary fractions in Galactic globular clusters
suggests that significant variations in the initial binary content could exist
among the analysed globular cluster. This model has been also used to explain

Galactic populations is still poorly understood. The bulge has been suggested
to be either a merger-driven classical bulge or the product of a dynamical
instability of the inner disk. To probe the star formation history, the initial
mass function and stellar nucleosynthesis of the bulge, we performed an
elemental abundance analysis of bulge red giant stars. We also completed an
identical study of local thin disk, thick disk and halo giants to establish the
chemical differences and similarities between the various populations.
High-resolution infrared spectra of 19 bulge giants and 49 comparison giants in
the solar neighborhood were acquired with Gemini/Phoenix. All stars have
similar stellar parameters but cover a broad range in metallicity. A standard
1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis yielded the abundances of C, N, O
and Fe. A homogeneous and differential analysis of the bulge, halo, thin disk
and thick disk stars ensured that systematic errors were minimized. We confirm
the well-established differences for [O/Fe] (at a given metallicity) between
the local thin and thick disks. For the elements investigated, we find no
chemical distinction between the bulge and the local thick disk, which is in
contrast to previous studies relying on literature values for disk dwarf stars
in the solar neighborhood. Our findings suggest that the bulge and local thick
disk experienced similar, but not necessarily shared, chemical evolution
histories. We argue that their formation timescales, star formation rates and
initial mass functions were similar.

biochemical systems. In recent times, their application has been extended to
the simulation of coarse-grained models of cellular networks in simple
organisms. In these models, components move by diffusion, and can react with
one another upon contact. However, when reactions are incorporated into a
Brownian Dynamics algorithm, attention must be paid to avoid violations of the
detailed-balance rule, and therefore introducing systematic errors in the
simulation. We present a Brownian Dynamics algorithm for reaction-diffusion
systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By
comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular
reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and
dynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a ``push-pull'' network in which
two antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight
that the diffusive behaviour of the reacting species can reduce the gain of the
response curve of this network.

nova V1280 Sco performed with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI).
Spectra and visibilities were obtained from the onset of the dust formation 23
days after discovery till day 145, using the instruments AMBER and MIDI. These
interferometric observations are complemented by near-infrared data from the
1.2m Mt. Abu Infrared Observatory, India. The observations are first
interpreted with simple models but more complex models, involving a second
shell, are necessary to explain the data obtained from t=110d after outburst.
This behavior is in accordance with the light curve of V1280 Sco which exhibits
a secondary peak around t=106d, followed by a new steep decline, suggesting a
new dust forming event. Spherical dust shell models generated with the DUSTY
code are also used to investigate the parameters of the main dust shell. Using
uniform disk and Gaussian models, these observations allow us to determine an
apparent linear expansion rate for the dust shell of 0.35 +/- 0.03 mas/day and
the approximate time of ejection of the matter in which dust formed as
t_ejec=10.5+/-7d, i.e. close to the maximum brightness. This information,
combined with the expansion velocity of 500+/-100km/s, implies a distance
estimate of 1.6+/-0.4kpc. The dust mass generated was typically 2-8 10^-9 solar
mass per day. Considering that the dust forming event lasted at least 200-250d,
the mass of the ejected material is likely to have exceeded 10^-4 solar mass.

Proposed solutions to this so-called ""faint young Sun problem"" have usually
involved higher amounts of greenhouse gases than present in the modern-day

atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the Archaean and Proterozoic were far too
low to keep the surface from freezing. With a radiative-convective model
including new, updated thermal absorption coefficients, we found that the
amount of CO2 necessary to obtain 273 K at the surface is reduced up to an
order of magnitude compared to previous studies. For the late Archaean and
early Proterozoic period of the Earth, we calculate that CO2 partial pressures
of only about 2.9 mb are required to keep its surface from freezing which is
compatible with the amount inferred from sediment studies. This conclusion was
not significantly changed when we varied model parameters such as relative
humidity or surface albedo, obtaining CO2 partial pressures for the late
Archaean between 1.5 and 5.5 mb. Thus, the contradiction between sediment data
and model results disappears for the late Archaean and early Proterozoic.

relatively low luminosity masers probably associated with star formation. The

accelerations among the systemic features ranging from 2 to 8 km/s/yr, the
larger values belonging to the most redshifted systemic components.
