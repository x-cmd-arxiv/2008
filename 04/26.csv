adding 3-form flux with support at infinity to local Calabi-Yau geometries in
type IIB. This allows us to apply the formalism of Ooguri, Ookouchi, and Park
[arXiv:0704.3613] to demonstrate that, by tuning the flux at infinity, we can
stabilize the dynamical complex structure moduli in a metastable,
supersymmetry-breaking configuration. Moreover, we argue that this setup can
arise naturally as a limit of a larger Calabi-Yau which separates into two
weakly interacting regions; the flux in one region leaks into the other, where
it appears to be supported at infinity and induces the desired superpotential.
In our endeavor to confirm this picture in cases with many 3-cycles, we also
compute the CIV-DV prepotential for arbitrary number of cuts up to fifth order
in the glueball fields.

in the cluster, CXO J164710.2-455216, is a slowly spinning (10 s) single
neutron star and potentially a magnetar. Since this source was argued to be a
member of the cluster, the neutron star progenitor must have been very massive
(M_zams > 40 Msun) as noted by Muno et al. (2006). Since such massive stars are
generally believed to form black holes (rather than neutron stars), the
existence of this object poses a challenge for understanding massive star
evolution. We point out while single star progenitors below M_zams < 20 Msun
form neutron stars, binary evolution completely changes the progenitor mass
range. In particular, we demonstrate that mass loss in Roche lobe overflow
enables stars as massive as 50-80 Msun, under favorable conditions, to form
neutron stars. If the very high observed binary fraction of massive stars in
Westerlund 1 (> 70 percent) is considered, it is natural that CXO
J164710.2-455216 was formed in a binary which was disrupted in a supernova
explosion such that it is now found as a single neutron star. Hence, the
existence of a neutron star in a given stellar population does not necessarily
place stringent constraints on progenitor mass when binary interactions are
considered. It is concluded that the existence of a neutron star in Westerlund
1 cluster is fully consistent with the generally accepted framework of stellar
evolution.

radiation of primordial or astrophysical origin with the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA) relies on the combined use of two LISA channels, one of
which is insensitive to gravitational waves, such as the symmetrised Sagnac.
For this method to work, it is essential to know how the instrumental noise
power in the two channels are related to one another; however, no quantitative
estimates of this key information are available to date. The purpose of our
study is to assess the performance of the symmetrised Sagnac method for
different levels of prior information regarding the instrumental noise. We
develop a general approach in the framework of Bayesian inference and an
end-to-end analysis algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to
compute the posterior probability density functions of the relevant model
parameters. We apply this method to data released as part of the second round
of the Mock LISA Data Challenges. For the selected (and somewhat idealised)
cases considered here, we find that a prior uncertainty of a factor ~2 in the
ratio between the power of the instrumental noise contributions in the two
channels allows for the detection of isotropic stochastic radiation. More
importantly, we provide a framework for more realistic studies of LISA's
performance and development of analysis techniques in the context of searches
for stochastic signals.

introduce important physical processes, such as molecular hydrogen cooling and
stellar feedback, to base models that only consider atomic hydrogen and helium
cooling. In these base models, we find that gas in dark matter halos with
masses ~10^8 solar masses centrally collapse before multiple fragmentation
occurs in a global disc. We then investigate the importance of molecular
hydrogen cooling in early structure formation in the presence of a soft
ultraviolet radiation background. We find that molecular hydrogen plays an
important role in star formation in halos well below a virial temperature of
10,000 K even in the most extreme assumptions of negative radiative feedback.
We also present results from the first radiation hydrodynamics calculations of
early dwarf galaxy formation. We develop a novel technique, adaptive ray
tracing, to accurately transport radiation from primordial stars. We find
primordial stellar feedback alters the landscape of early galaxy formation in
that its angular momentum is increased and baryon fractions are decreased. We
also describe the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium and early dwarf
galaxies. Finally we explore cosmological reionization by these massive,
metal-free stars and its effects on star formation in early galaxies.

more favorable than the nodal $d_{XY}$-wave state if the interband AF spin

strong analogies between the probabilistic behavior of quantum systems defined
by Hermitian Hamiltonians and the deterministic behavior of classical
mechanical systems extended into the complex domain. Three models are examined:
the quartic double-well potential $V(x)=x^4-5x^2$, the cubic potential
$V(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2-gx^3$, and the periodic potential $V(x)=-\cos x$. For the
quartic potential a wave packet that is initially localized in one side of the
double-well can tunnel to the other side. Complex solutions to the classical
equations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore,
classical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and
odd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum
wave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near
the origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability
current that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding
classical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the
periodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can
tunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute
a localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the

delocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical
particle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random
walk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle
becomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.

on average a higher rate of star formation immediately before falling into a

convergence of the flux series; nevertheless, the Pade flux is markedly closer
to the numerical result for the whole range of the simulation (about 30 GW
cycles). Taylor and Pade models overestimate the increase in flux and frequency
derivative close to merger, whereas EOB models reproduce more faithfully the
shape of and are closer to the numerical flux, frequency derivative and
derivative of energy. We also compare the GW phase of the numerical simulation

waveforms, we find that the phase difference accumulated until $M \omega = 0.1$

approximant with Keplerian (non-Keplerian) flux. We fit free parameters within

using a finite number of moments of the particle size distribution. This
approach is particularly useful when only general properties of the
distribution, and their time evolution, are needed. The numerical solution to
the integro-differential Smoluchowski coagulation equation at every time step,
for every particle size, and at every spatial location is computationally
expensive, and serves as the primary bottleneck in running evolutionary models
over long periods of time. The advantage of using the moments method comes in
the computational time savings gained from only tracking the time rate of
change of the moments, as opposed to tracking the entire mass histogram which
can contain hundreds or thousands of bins depending on the desired accuracy.
The collision kernels of the coagulation equation contain all the necessary
information about particle relative velocities, cross-sections, and sticking
coefficients. We show how arbitrary collision kernels may be treated. We
discuss particle relative velocities in both turbulent and non-turbulent
regimes. We present examples of this approach that utilize different collision
kernels and find good agreement between the moment solutions and the moments as
calculated from direct integration of the coagulation equation. As practical
applications, we demonstrate how the moments method can be used to track the

fourth-order derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator model has a realization in
which the energy eigenvalues are real and bounded below, the Hilbert-space
inner product is positive definite, and time evolution is unitary. Central to
that analysis was the recognition that the Hamiltonian $H_{\rm PU}$ of the
model is PT symmetric. This Hamiltonian was mapped to a conventional
Dirac-Hermitian Hamiltonian via a similarity transformation whose form was
found exactly. The present paper explores the equal-frequency limit of the same
model. It is shown that in this limit the similarity transform that was used
for the unequal-frequency case becomes singular and that $H_{\rm PU}$ becomes a
Jordan-block operator, which is nondiagonalizable and has fewer energy
eigenstates than eigenvalues. Such a Hamiltonian has no Hermitian counterpart.
Thus, the equal-frequency PT theory emerges as a distinct realization of
quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanics associated with this Jordan-block
Hamiltonian can be treated exactly. It is shown that the Hilbert space is
complete with a set of nonstationary solutions to the Schr\""odinger equation
replacing the missing stationary ones. These nonstationary states are needed to
establish that the Jordan-block Hamiltonian of the equal-frequency

jets remains controversial. To explore issues of turbulence and fossil cavities
driven by young stellar outflows we present a series of numerical simulations
tracking the evolution of transient protostellar jets driven into a turbulent
medium. Our simulations show both the effect of turbulence on outflow
structures and, conversely, the effect of outflows on the ambient turbulence.
We demonstrate how turbulence will lead to strong modifications in jet
morphology. More importantly, we demonstrate that individual transient outflows
have the capacity to re-energize decaying turbulence. Our simulations support a
scenario in which the directed energy/momentum associated with cavities is
randomized as the cavities are disrupted by dynamical instabilities seeded by
the ambient turbulence. Consideration of the energy power spectra of the
simulations reveals that the disruption of the cavities powers an energy
cascade consistent with Burgers'-type turbulence and produces a driving
scale-length associated with the cavity propagation length. We conclude that
fossil cavities interacting either with a turbulent medium or with other
cavities have the capacity to sustain or create turbulent flows in star forming
environments. In the last section we contrast our work and its conclusions with
previous studies which claim that jets can not be the source of turbulence.

threaded by a strong magnetic field capable of resisting severe tangling by
turbulent motions and retarding global gravitational contraction in the
cross-field direction. They are motivated by observations of the Taurus
molecular cloud complex (and, to a lesser extent, Pipe Nebula), which shows an
ordered large-scale magnetic field, as well as elongated condensations that are
generally perpendicular to the large-scale field. We find that stars form in
earnest in such clouds when enough material has settled gravitationally along
the field lines that the mass-to-flux ratios of the condensations approach the
critical value. Only a small fraction (of order 1% or less) of the nearly
magnetically-critical, condensed material is turned into stars per local
free-fall time, however. The slow star formation takes place in condensations
that are moderately supersonic; it is regulated primarily by magnetic fields,
rather than turbulence. The quiescent condensations are surrounded by diffuse
halos that are much more turbulent, as observed in the Taurus complex. Strong
support for magnetic regulation of star formation in this complex comes from
the extremely slow conversion of the already condensed, relatively quiescent
C$^{18}$O gas into stars, at a rate two orders of magnitude below the maximum,
free-fall value. We analyze the properties of dense cores, including their mass
spectrum, which resembles the stellar initial mass function.

by classical theory, up to multiplication of observables. Logic of the emergent
theory is rather intuitionistic than classical. Adding to the language the type
of self-adjoint operators and their products, which are interpreted by the
on-stages daseinisations and their products, one gets commuting presheaves in
the topos. The interpretation agrees with on-stages daseinisations of squares
up to some automorphisms of the topos. The uncertainty principle does not hold
for such an interpretation. According to the recent proposition by the author,
topoi can modify local smooth spacetime structure. A way how to add gravity
into the spectral topos of a system is presented. Assuming that a quantum
system modifies the local spacetime structure and interacts with a
gravitational field via the spectral topos, the lowest energy modes of a
quantum harmonic oscillator are gravitationally nullified. Moreover, a theory
of gravity and systems should be symmetric with respect to the 2-group of
automorphisms of the category of topoi. Under the $\delta_0$-interpretation for
the hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator, its lowest modes have
vanishing contributions to the cosmological constant. This is related with a
fundamental higher symmetry group of gravity. Without the

describing a genetic switch with the concentration of one substrate fluctuating

asymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the
noise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an

model with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate
analytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of
noise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement
with the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation
results suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying
biochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization
mechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the
consequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of
fluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although
the extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose
metabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.

alternatives of quantum gravity, produces significant modifications to the
Hawking radiation and the final stage of black hole evaporation. We show that
incorporation of the GUP into the quantum tunneling process (based on the
null-geodesic method) causes correlations between the tunneling probability of
different modes in the black hole radiation spectrum. In this manner, the
quantum information becomes encrypted in the Hawking radiation, and information
can be recovered as non-thermal GUP correlations between tunneling
probabilities of different modes.

absorption line spectroscopy to measure mean stellar velocity and velocity
dispersion profiles of 25 field early-type galaxies at a median redshift z=0.97
(full range 0.6<z<1.2). This provides the first detailed study of early-type
galaxy rotation at these redshifts. From surface brightness profiles from HST
imaging we calculate two-integral oblate axisymmetric Jeans equation models for
the observed kinematics. Fits to the data yield for each galaxy the degree of
rotational support and the mass-to-light ratio M/L_Jeans. S0 and Sa galaxies
are generally rotationally supported, whereas elliptical galaxies rotate less
rapidly or not at all. Down to M(B)=-19.5 (corrected for luminosity evolution),
we find no evidence for evolution in the fraction of rotating early-type (E+S0)
galaxies between z=1 (63+/-11%) and the present (61+/-5%). We interpret this as
evidence for little or no change in the field S0 fraction with redshift. We
compare M/L_Jeans with M/L_vir inferred from the virial theorem and globally
averaged quantities and assuming homologous evolution. There is good agreement
for non-rotating (mostly E) galaxies. However, for rotationally supported
galaxies (mostly S0) M/L_Jeans is on average ~40% higher than M/L_vir. We
discuss possible explanations and the implications for the evolution of M/L
between z=1 and the present and its dependence on mass.

the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) aboard the Hinode satellite, with the 3D radiative
MHD simulations of V{\""o}gler & Sch{\""u}ssler (2007). A synthetic image from
the simulation is degraded using a theoretical point-spread function of the
optical system, and by considering other important effects. The telescope
aperture and the obscuration by the secondary mirror and its attachment spider,
reduce the simulated contrast from 14.4 % to 8.5 %. A slight effective defocus
of the instrument brings the simulated contrast down to 7.5 %, close to the
observed value of 7.0 %. A proper consideration of the effects of the optical
system and a slight defocus, lead to sufficient degradation of the synthetic
image from the MHD simulation, such that the contrast reaches almost the
observed value. The remaining small discrepancy can be ascribed to straylight
and slight imperfections of the instrument, which are difficult to model.
Hence, Hinode SP data are consistent with a granulation contrast which is
predicted by 3D radiation MHD simulations.

work is a generalization of the Jones Polynomial. So it distinguishes any pair
of links which are distinguishable by Jones'. This new invariant, denoted {\em
VSE-invariant} is strictly stronger than Jones': I detected a pair of links
which are not distinguished by Jones' but are distinguished by the new
invariant. The full VSE-invariant has $3^n$ states. However, there are useful
specializations of it parametrized by an integer k, having
$O(n^k)=\sum_{\ell=0}^k {n \choose \ell} 2^\ell $ states. The link with more
crossings of the pair which was distinguished by the VSE-invariant has 20
crossings. The specialization which is enough to distinguish corresponds to k=2
and has only 801 states, as opposed to the $2^{20} = 1,048,576$ states of the
Jones polynomial of the same link. The full VSE-invariant of it has $3^{20} =
3,486,784,401$ states. The VSE-invariant is a good alternative for the Jones
polynomial when the number of crossings makes the computation of this

VSE-invariant of a link with $n=500$ crossings can be computed in a few
minutes, since it has only $2 n^2+1 = 500,001$ states.
