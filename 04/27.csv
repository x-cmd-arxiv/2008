for the total number of packet arrivals from selfish transmitters to converge
in distribution. The asymptotic packet arrival distribution at Nash equilibrium
is shown to be a mixture of a Poisson distribution and finitely many Bernoulli

information at the receiver, where the channel is modeled as a sequence of
finite dimensional conditional distributions not necessarily stationary,
ergodic, or information stable. The {\em Shannon capacity} is the highest rate
asymptotically achievable with arbitrarily small error probability. The {\em
capacity versus outage} is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with a
given probability of decoder-recognized outage. The {\em expected capacity} is
the highest average rate asymptotically achievable with a single encoder and
multiple decoders, where the channel side information determines the decoder in
use. As a special case of channel codes for expected rate, the code for
capacity versus outage has two decoders: one operates in the non-outage states
and decodes all transmitted information, and the other operates in the outage
states and decodes nothing. Expected capacity equals Shannon capacity for
channels governed by a stationary ergodic random process but is typically
greater for general channels. These alternative capacity definitions
essentially relax the constraint that all transmitted information must be
decoded at the receiver. We derive capacity theorems for these capacity
definitions through information density. Numerical examples are provided to
demonstrate their connections and differences. We also discuss the implication

state, the Lagrangian particle trajectories are periodic. In a system with
roll-switching, the particles can exhibit three-dimensional, chaotic motion. We
study a simple phenomenological map that models the Lagrangian dynamics in a

we show that the phase space is dominated by invariant tori if the ratio of
switching time to roll turnover time is small. When this parameter approaches
zero these tori limit onto the classical hexagonal convection patterns, and, as
it gets large, the dynamics becomes fully chaotic and well-mixed. For
intermediate values, there are interlinked toroidal and poloidal structures
separated by chaotic regions. We also compute the exit time distributions and

distinction between the referential and local descriptions, the principle of
material invariance is established and shown to be a true covariance principle,
unlike the Lorentz covariance, which is valid only for non-deforming frames in
rectilinear relative motion. Thus, this paper establishes that electrodynamics
can be fully explained if one assumes that it is the manifestation of the
internal forces of an underlying elastic material which we term the
metacontinuum.
  The new frame-indifferent formulation of electrodynamics is shown to
incorporate the Lorentz force as an integral part of Faraday's law, rather than
as an additional empirical variable. Respectively, if the upper-convected
derivative is added in Maxwell's displacement current it can explain
Biot-Savart's and Oersted-Ampere's laws. An immediate corollary of the material
invariance is the Galilean invariance of the model.

the famous experiment of Ives and Stilwell is reexamined with a modified
Bohr-Rydberg formula for the emitted frequencies from a moving atom, and it is
shown that the results are fully compatible with the presence of an absolute

small-world networks abound in sociology, biology, neuroscience and physics as

of messages in dense small-world networks constructed on a plane. Iterative
equations for the average message delivery time in these networks are provided
for the situation in which nodes employ a simple greedy geographic routing
algorithm. It is shown that two network nodes communicate with each other only
through their short-range contacts, and that the average message delivery time
rises linearly if the separation between them is small. On the other hand, if
their separation increases, the average message delivery time rapidly saturates
to a constant value and stays almost the same for all large values of their
separation.

an Eichler order of square-free level $N$ in an indefinite rational quaternion
algebra of discriminant $D>1$. We prove that, when the genus $g$ of the curve
is greater than or equal to 2, $\Aut (X_0(D, N))$ is a 2-elementary abelian
group which contains the group of Atkin-Lehner involutions $W_0(D, N)$ as a
subgroup of index 1 or 2. It is conjectured that $\Aut (X_0(D, N)) = W_0(D, N)$
except for finitely many values of $(D, N)$ and we provide criteria that allow
us to show that this is indeed often the case. Our methods are based on the
theory of complex multiplication of Shimura curves and the Cerednik-Drinfeld
theory on their rigid analytic uniformization at primes $p\mid D$.

deflection potential of dark matter halos in the strong lensing regime. This
investigation is based on the pertubative solution around the Einstein radius
(Alard 2007) in which all the information on the deflection potential is
specified by only a pair of one-dimensional functions on this ring. Using
direct comparison with ray-tracing solutions, we found that the iso-contours of
lensed images predicted by the pertubative solution is reproduced with a mean
error on their radial extension of less than 1% - in units of the Einstein
radius, for reasonable substructure masses. It demonstrates the efficiency of
the approximation to track possible signatures of substructures. We have
evaluated these two fields and studied their properties for different lens
configurations modelled either through massive dark matter halos from a
cosmological N-body simulation, or via toy models of Monte Carlo distribution
of substructures embedded in a triaxial Hernquist potential. As expected, the
angular power spectra of these two fields tend to have larger values for larger
harmonic numbers when substructures are accounted for and they can be
approximated by power-laws, whose values are fitted as a function of the
profile and the distribution of the substructures.

distance between the \emph{context} trees associated to the sequences. These
trees are defined in the framework of \emph{Sparse Probabilistic Suffix Trees}
(SPST), and can be estimated using the SPST algorithm. We implement the
Phyl-SPST package to compute the distance between the sparse context trees
estimated with the SPST algorithm. The distance takes into account the
structure of the trees, and indirectly the transition probabilities. We apply
this approach to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of protein sequences in the
globin family of vertebrates. We compare this tree with the one obtained using
the well-known PAM distance.

serious investigation. Having three different important theories,(quantum
mechanics, string theory and inflation), predict the existence of the
multiverse is hardly coincidental. I argue that the existence of the multiverse
must be expected from the underlying fundamental theory or else we can not
meaningfully address the puzzle of the initial conditions. In this view, the
extension of our current cosmology to a multiverse framework becomes an
extension of the Copernican principle to nature. In order to discuss the
ontology of the multiverse I propose to apply:
  - the principle of 'No Perpetual Motion' as a criterion for the parameter of
time; and,
  - the principle of 'Domains Correlations' as a criterion for determining the
background spacetime in which the multiverse is embedded.

into a ballistic conductor, taking place in on-demand electron sources, in
general may result in excitation of particle-hole pairs. We consider a simple
model for these effects, involving a resonance level with time-dependent
energy, and derive Floquet scattering matrix describing inelastic transitions
of particles in the Fermi sea. We find that, as the resonance level is driven
through the Fermi level, particle transfer may take place completely without
particle-hole excitations for certain driving protocols. In particular, such
noiseless transfer occurs when the level moves with constant rapidity, its
energy changing linearly with time. A detection scheme for studying the
coherence of particle transfer is proposed.

Nevertheless there still might be dangerous flavor or CP violation induced by
higher order K\""ahler potential. We examine the constraints on such SUSY
breaking scheme imposed by low energy flavor and/or CP violating observables.
It is found that all phenomenological constraints can be satisfied even for
generic form of higher order K\""ahler potential and sparticle spectra in the
sub-TeV range, under plausible assumptions on the size of higher order
correction and flavor mixing angles. This implies for instance that mirage
mediation scheme of SUSY breaking, which involves such modulus mediation
together with an anomaly mediation of comparable size, and also the
modulus-dominated mediation realized in flux compactification can be free from
the SUSY flavor and CP problems, while giving gaugino and sfermion masses in
