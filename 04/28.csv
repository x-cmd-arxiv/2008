which underlies quantum mechanics. An electron is modeled, not as a point
particle, but as the end of an electromagnetic string, a line of flux. These
lines stretch across cosmic distances, but are almost unobservable because they
condense into pairs--which form the ether. Photons are modeled to propagate on
these line pairs, which act effectively as wave guides. These line pairs are
also responsible for the force of gravity--which is electromagnetic in
character.

external resources. It leads to Zipf distribution of firms over their sizes,
turning to stretched exponent because of size-dependent effects, and predicts
exponential distribution of income between individuals. We also present new
approach to describe fluctuations on the market, based on separation of hot
(short-time) and cold (long-time) degrees of freedoms, which predicts tent-like
distribution of fluctuations with stable tail exponent mu=3 (mu=2 for news).
The theory predicts observable asymmetry of the distribution, and its size
dependence. In the case of financial markets the theory explains first time
market mill patterns, conditional distribution, D-smile, z-shaped response,
conditional double dynamics, the skewness and so on. We derive the set of
Langeven equations, which predicts logarithmic dependence of price shift on
trading volume and volatility patterns after jumps. We calculate parameters of
price distributions, correlation functions and Hurst exponents at different
time scales. At large times the price experiences fractional Brownian motion
with chaotically switching of long-time persistent and anti-persistent
behavior, and we calculate corresponding probabilities, response functions, and
risks.

is accelerated by nonlinear flows, by performing three-dimensional non-ideal

turbulent-like flow is input into a self-gravitating gas layer that is threaded
by a uniform magnetic field (perpendicular to the layer) such that the initial
mass-to-flux ratio is subcritical. Magnetic ambipolar diffusion occurs very
rapidly initially due to the sharp gradients introduced by the turbulent flow.
It subsequently occurs more slowly in the traditional near-quasistatic manner,
but in regions of greater mean density than present in the initial state. The
overall timescale for runaway growth of the first core(s) is several times,
10^6 yr, even though previous studies have found a timescale of several times,
10^7 yr when starting with linear perturbations and similar physical
parameters. Large-scale supersonic flows exist in the cloud and provide an
observationally testable distinguishing characteristic from core formation due
to linear initial perturbations. However, the nonlinear flows have decayed
sufficiently that the relative infall motions onto the first core are subsonic,
as in the case of starting from linear initial perturbations. The ion infall
motions are very similar to those of neutrals; however, they lag the neutral
infall in directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction and
lead the neutral infall in the direction parallel to the mean magnetic field.

  calculations","Submitted to Phys. Rev. B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.79.205322",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Wave Function Matching (WFM) technique has recently been developed for
the calculation of electronic transport in quantum two-probe systems. In terms
of efficiency it is comparable with the widely used Green's function approach.
The WFM formalism presented so far requires the evaluation of all the
propagating and evanescent bulk modes of the left and right electrodes in order
to obtain the correct coupling between device and electrode regions. In this
paper we will describe a modified WFM approach that allows for the exclusion of
the vast majority of the evanescent modes in all parts of the calculation. This
approach makes it feasible to apply iterative techniques to efficiently
determine the few required bulk modes, which allows for a significant reduction
of the computational expense of the WFM method. We illustrate the efficiency of
the method on a carbon nanotube field-effect-transistor (FET) device displaying
band-to-band tunneling and modeled within the semi-empirical Extended H\""uckel
theory (EHT) framework.

to distinguish single-particle states from multi-particle states in lattice QCD
calculations. Within a solvable model, the Lee model, we show that this
criteria is in principle only valid for a stable particle or a narrow
resonance. If the resonance being studied is broad, then the volume dependence
of the corresponding spectral weight resembles that of a multi-particle state
instead of a single-particle one. For an unstable $V$-particle in the Lee
model, the transition from single-particle to multi-particle volume dependence
is governed by the ratio of its physical width to the typical level spacing in
the finite volume. We estimate this ratio for practical lattice QCD simulations
and find that, for most cases, the resonance studied in lattice QCD simulations
still resembles the single particle behavior.

expressions of several moments for the time and noise dependence of position.
Moreover, the limiting position distributions of decoherent quantum random
walks are shown to be Gaussian in an analytical manner. These results
explicitly describe the relationship between the system and the level of

spectra of the 0.11 < z < 0.54 objects in the EGS portion of the DEEP2 survey.
Doppler shifts from the host galaxy redshifts are systematically searched for
in the Na I 5890,96 doublet (Na D). Although the spectral resolution and S/N
limit us to study the interstellar gas kinematics from fitting a single doublet
component to each observed Na D profile, the typical outflow often seen in
local luminous-infrared galaxies (LIRGs) should be detected at >~ 6 sigma in
absorption equivalent width down to the survey limiting S/N (~ 5 per pixel) in
the continuum around Na D. The detection rate of LIRG-like outflow clearly
shows an increasing trend with star-forming activity and infrared luminosity.
However, by virtue of not selecting our sample on star formation, we also find
a majority of outflows in galaxies on the red sequence in the rest-frame (U-B,
M_B) color-magnitude diagram. Most of these red-sequence outflows are of
early-type morphology and show the sign of recent star formation in their
UV-optical colors; some show enhanced Balmer H-beta absorption lines indicative
of poststarburst as well as high dust extinction. These findings demonstrate
that outflows outlive starbursts and suggest that galactic-scale outflows play
a role in quenching star formation in the host galaxies on their way to the red
sequence. The fate of relic winds, as well as the observational constraints on
gaseous feedback models, may be studied in galaxies during their poststarburst
phase. We also note the presence of inflow candidates in red, early-type
galaxies, some with signs of AGNs/LINERs but little evidence for star
formation.

ultra-incompressibility of ReN is attributed to its high valence electron

show that the bondings of ReN should be a mixture of metallic, covalent, and

and triplet pairing interactions which arise from the exchange of spin and
orbital fluctuations for a 2-orbital model of the Fe-pnictide superconductors.
When the system is doped with F, the electron pockets become dominant and we
find that the strongest pairing occurs in the singlet d-wave pairing and the
triplet p-wave pairing channels, which compete closely. The pairing structure
in the singlet d-wave channel corresponds to a superposition of near neighbor
intra-orbital singlets with a minus sign phase difference between the $d_{xz}$
and $d_{yz}$ pairs. The leading pairing configuration in the triplet channel
also involves a nearest neighbor intra-orbital pairing. We find that the
strengths of both the singlet and triplet pairing grow, with the singlet
pairing growing faster, as the onsite Coulomb interaction approaches the value
where the S=1 particle-hole susceptibility diverges.

producing GHZ states that can be used to create large cluster states. Each of

this generalization is that it inherits some of the properties of the original

V32 located in the central field of the globular cluster NGC 6397. The variable
is a single-line spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 9.8783d and a
large eccentricity of e=0.32. Its systemic velocity (gamma=20.7 km/s) and
metallicity ([Fe/H] -1.9) are both consistent with cluster membership. The
primary component of the binary is located at the top of the main-sequence
turn-off on the cluster color-magnitude diagram. Only a shallow primary eclipse
is observed in the light curve. Based on stellar models for an age of 12Gyr and
the mass-function derived from the radial velocity curve, we estimate the
masses to be M_p=0.79 Msun and M_s=0.23 Msun. The light curve of V32 can be
reproduced by adopting R_p=1.569 Rsun and R_s=0.236 Rsun for the radii and
i=85.44 deg for the system inclination. The system geometry precludes
observations of the secondary eclipse. The large eccentricity of the orbit is
puzzling given that for metal poor, halo binaries the transition from circular
to eccentric orbit occurs at an orbital period of about 20 days. We suppose
that the orbit of V32 was modified relatively recently by dynamical interaction
with other cluster star(s).An alternative explanation of the observed
eccentricity calls for the presence of a third body in the system.

ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters. The aim of
this work is to test two formation hypotheses for UCDs--whether they are bright
globular clusters (GCs) or ""threshed'' early-type dwarf galaxies--by comparison
of UCD structural parameters and colors with GCs and galaxy nuclei. We find
that the UCD surface brightness profiles can be described by a range of models
and that the luminous UCDs can not be described by standard King models with
tidal cutoffs as they have extended outer halos. This is not expected from
traditional King models of GCs, but is consistent with recent results for
massive GCs. The total luminosities, colors and sizes of the UCDs are
consistent with them being either luminous GCs or threshed nuclei of both
early-type and late-type galaxies (not just early-type dwarfs). For the most
luminous UCDs we estimate color gradients over a limited range of radius. These
are systematically positive in the sense of getting redder outwards: mean
Delta(F606W-F814W)=0.14 mag per 100 pc with rms=0.06 mag per 100 pc. The
positive gradients found in the bright UCDs are consistent with them being
either bright GCs or threshed early-type dwarf galaxies (except VUCD3). In
contrast to the above results we find a very significant difference in the
sizes of UCDs and early-type galaxy nuclei: the effective radii of UCDs are 2.2
times larger than those of early-type galaxy nuclei at the same luminosity.

networks and further discovered many representative characteristics, such as

differentiate social networks from nonsocial ones. However, people are not
satisfied with these achievements and more and more attention has been paid on
how to uncover those dynamic characteristics of social networks, especially how
to track community evolution effectively. With these interests, in the paper we
firstly display some basic but dynamic features of social networks. Then on its
basis, we propose a novel core-based algorithm of tracking community evolution,
CommTracker, which depends on core nodes to establish the evolving
relationships among communities at different snapshots. With the algorithm, we
discover two unique phenomena in social networks and further propose two
representative coefficients: GROWTH and METABOLISM by which we are also able to
distinguish social networks from nonsocial ones from the dynamic aspect. At
last, we have developed a social network model which has the capabilities of
exhibiting two necessary features above.

optical/near-infrared (NIR) with various telescopes starting from about 2min
after the high-energy event. Swift-XRT observations started only later at about
0.4d. The light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phase
with a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context of
the standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decay
interrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. The rebrightening was
visible in both the optical/NIR and X-rays and can be interpreted as an episode
of discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. A
steepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. The entire
evolution of the optical/NIR afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.
This could be one of the few identified GRB afterglows with an achromatic break
in the X-ray through the optical/NIR bands. Polarimetry was also obtained at
about 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with the
steepening. This provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for the
polarized-flux fraction.

of two travelling waves propagating in opposite directions. It is found that
generally a zone of a weak current is formed between these two waves. Waves are

the calm water surface. Long wave runup on a beach with this profile is studied
for sine pulse, KdV soliton and N-wave. Shown is that in certain cases the

with a linear slope. The analysis of wave reflection from the bottom containing
a shallow coastal area of constant depth and a section with the convex profile

new segmentation method based on wavelet decomposition and thresholding, which
detects significant breakpoints in the data. Our algorithm is over 1,000 times
faster than leading approaches, with similar performance. Another key advantage
of the proposed method is its simplicity and flexibility. Due to its intuitive
structure it can be easily generalized to incorporate several types of side
information. Here we consider two extensions which include side information
indicating the reliability of each measurement, and compensating for a changing
variability in the measurement noise. The resulting algorithm outperforms

through a significant example centered on a communication protocol. More
precisely, concurrent runs of the protocol are formalized by parallel instances

are specified through Metric Temporal Logic formulas, thus creating a
multi-paradigm model. Verification tests run on this model using a bounded

reception for coded modulation systems which use direct modulation mapping of

'maximum-likelihood certificate' property. It is also shown that the decoder

the [11,6] ternary Golay code with ternary PSK modulation over AWGN, and in

computed the dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR) using a spectroscopically selected

to the blue dwarf population (u-r < 2.22). The u-r color of red dwarf galaxies

correlations at RHIC provide powerful ``external'' probes of the sQGP produced
in A+A reactions, but it simultaneously raises the question where the jet
energy was deposited. The nearly perfect bulk fluidity observed via elliptic
flow suggests that Mach cone--like correlations may also be due to rapid local
equilibration in the wake of penetrating jets. Multi-particle correlations lend
further support to this possibility. However, a combined study of energy
deposition and fluid response is needed. We solve numerically 3--dimensional
ideal hydrodynamical equations to compute the flow correlation patterns
resulting from a variety of possible energy-momentum deposition models.
Mach--cone correlations are shown to depend critically on the energy and
momentum deposition mechanisms. They only survive for a special limited class
of energy--momentum loss models, which assume significantly less longitudinal
momentum loss than energy loss per unit length. We conclude that the correct
interpretation of away--side jet correlations will require improved
understanding and independent experimental constraints on the jet
energy--momentum loss to fluid couplings.

separation. Some impurities with low atomic number $Z$ are concentrated in a

separate into regions of different compositions. This could lead to an

in the atomic limit within the Green's function and equation of motion
formalism. We provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the model by
considering all the relevant response and correlation functions as well as
thermodynamic quantities in the whole parameter space. At zero temperature we
identify four phases in the plane (U,n) [U is the onsite potential and n is the
filling] and relative phase transitions as well as different types of charge
ordering. These features are endorsed by investigating at T=0 the chemical
potential and pertinent local correlators, the particle and double occupancy
correlation functions, the entropy, and by studying the behavior in the limit T
going to zero of the charge and spin susceptibilities. A detailed study of the
thermodynamic quantities is also presented at finite temperature. This study
evidences that a finite-range order persists for a wide range of the
temperature, as shown by the behavior of the correlation functions and by the
two-peak structure exhibited by the charge susceptibility and by the entropy.
Moreover, the equation of motion formalism, together with the use of composite
operators, allows us to exactly determine the set of elementary excitations. As
a result, the density of states can be determined exactly and a detailed
analysis of the specific heat allows for identifying the excitations and for
ascribing its two-peak structure to a redistribution of the charge density.

and gluon Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and the cross section of
Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) in the small-$x_{B}$ region. We
demonstrate that the DVCS cross section becomes independent of energy in the
limit of very small $x_{B}$, which clearly indicates saturation of the DVCS
cross section. Our predictions for the GPDs and the DVCS cross section at
high-energies can be tested at the future Electron-Ion Collider and in
ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC.

Keller-Segel model. These models include fluctuations which are important in
systems with small particle numbers or close to a critical point. Following
Dean's approach, we derive the exact kinetic equation satisfied by the density
distribution of cells. In the mean field limit where statistical correlations
between cells are neglected, we recover the Keller-Segel model governing the
smooth density field. We also consider hydrodynamic and kinetic models of
chemotaxis that take into account the inertia of the particles and lead to a
delay in the adjustment of the velocity of cells with the chemotactic gradient.
We make the connection with the Cattaneo model of chemotaxis and the telegraph
equation.

magnetic flux bundle and rotation about the axis is presented. The model
contains a compressible plasma described by the nonlinear MHD equations, with
density and temperature gradients simulating the upper layer of the sun's
convection zone. The solutions exhibit a central magnetic flux tube in a
cylindrical numerical domain, with convection cells forming collar flows around
the tube. When the numerical domain is rotated with a constant angular
velocity, the plasma forms a Rankine vortex, with the plasma rotating as a
rigid body where the magnetic field is strong, as in the flux tube, while
experiencing sheared azimuthal flow in the surrounding convection cells,
forming a free vortex. As a result, the azimuthal velocity component has its
maximum value close to the outer edge of the flux tube. The azimuthal flow
inside the magnetic flux tube and the vortex flow are prograde relative to the
rotating cylindrical reference frame. A retrograde flow appears at the outer
wall. The most significant convection cell outside the flux tube is the
location for the maximum value of the azimuthal magnetic field component. The
azimuthal flow and magnetic structure are not generated spontaneously, but
decay exponentially in the absence of any imposed rotation of the cylindrical
domain.

in an Al/AlOx/Al and three Nb/AlOx/Nb dc SQUID phase qubits. One junction of
the SQUID acts as a phase qubit and the other junction acts as a
current-controlled nonlinear isolating inductor, allowing us to change the
coupling to the current bias leads in situ by an order of magnitude. We found
that for the Al qubit a spectroscopic coherence time T2* varied from 3 to 7 ns
and the decay envelope of Rabi oscillations had a time constant T' = 25 ns on
average at 80 mK. The three Nb devices also showed T2* in the range of 4 to 6
ns, but T' was 9 to 15 ns, just about 1/2 the value we found in the Al device.
For all the devices, the time constants were roughly independent of the
isolation from the bias lines, implying that noise and dissipation from the
bias leads were not the principal sources of dephasing and inhomogeneous
broadening.

past 10 billion years by taking near-IR spectra and measuring redshifts for
more than half a billion galaxies at 0<z<2 down to AB~23 over 3\pi sr of the
sky. In addition, SPACE will also target a smaller sky field, performing a deep
spectroscopic survey of millions of galaxies to AB~26 and at 2<z<10+. These
goals are unreachable with ground-based observations due to the ~500 times
higher sky background. To achieve the main science objectives, SPACE will use a
1.5m diameter Ritchey-Chretien telescope equipped with a set of arrays of
Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) covering a total field of view of 0.4 deg2,
and will perform large-multiplexing multi-object spectroscopy (e.g. ~6000
targets per pointing) at a spectral resolution of R~400 as well as
diffraction-limited imaging with continuous coverage from 0.8mum to 1.8mum.

possibility of information loss in black holes is closely related to the global
causal structure of spacetime, as is the existence of event horizons. However,
black holes need not be defined by event horizons, and in fact we argue that in
order to have a fully unitary evolution for black holes, they should be defined
in terms of something else, such as a trapping horizon. The Misner-Sharp mass
in spherical symmetry shows very simply how trapping horizons can give rise to
black hole thermodynamics, Hawking radiation and singularities. We show how the
Misner-Sharp mass can also be used to give insights into the process of
collapse and evaporation of locally defined black holes.

unique field in the exterior domain, which means that the associated basis
functions (often called ``fundamental solutions'') are independent. A new proof
of this result is given in this paper that can be generalized to other finite
combinations of point source distributions. For example, this paper shows in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ that a finite combination of point dipoles produces a unique
field. The strategy employed in the paper is to develop results for analytic
functions in the complex plane and then carry them over to harmonic functions
in the real plane, and from there to harmonic functions in $\mathbb{R}^3$. More
results are shown for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and for $\mathbb{C}$ than are shown for
more general settings. For example, in the complex plane, the paper shows that
a finite combination of higher order poles of any order in the interior of a
unit disk always corresponds to a unique analytic function in the exterior of a
unit disk.
