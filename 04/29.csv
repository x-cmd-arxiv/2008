z~2.3, identified in a previous paper, suggests that a red sequence may already
be in place beyond z=2. In order to test this hypothesis, we study the
rest-frame U-B color distribution of massive galaxies at 2<z<3. The sample is
drawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. The
color distribution shows a statistically significant (>3 sigma) red sequence,
which hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. The red-sequence
galaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from both
emission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. Their strong Balmer
breaks and their location in the rest-frame U-B, B-V plane indicate that they
are in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 Gyr. In order to
study the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample with
spectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02<z<0.045 and 0.6<z<1.0. The
rest-frame U-B color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a given
mass. Over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density on
the high-mass end (>10^11 Msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and
~6, respectively. We explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.
Passive evolution models predict too strong d(U-B), and produce z~0 galaxies
that are too red. More complicated models that include aging, galaxy
transformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and color
evolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.

scalar quarks and leptons are given by gauge couplings but exhibit no large

in the 60's, several results have been proved which give some relationships
between the Hilbert coefficients, but always assuming the Cohen-Macaulayness of
the basic ring. Recent papers of S. Goto, K. Nishida, A. Corso and W.
Vasconcelos pushed the interest toward a more general setting. In this paper we
extend an upper bound on $e_1$ proved by S. Huckaba and T. Marley. Thus we get
the Cohen-Macaulayness of the ring $A$ as a consequence of the extremal
behavior of the integer $e_1.$ The result can be considered a confirm of the
general philosophy of the paper of W. Vasconcelos where the Chern number is
conjectured to be a measure of the distance from the Cohen-Macaulyness of $A.$
This main result of the paper is a consequence of a nice and perhaps unexpected
property of superficial elements. It is essentially a kind of ""Sally machine""
for local rings. In the last section we describe an application of these
results, concerning an upper bound on the multiplicity of the Sally module of a
good filtration of a module which is not necessarily Cohen-Macaulay. It is an
extension to the non Cohen-Macaulay case of a result of Vaz Pinto.

require a large dynamic range in particle number. The underlying idea is that,
in order to calculate the collisional evolution of a system, some particle
interactions are more important than others and require more resolution, while
the behavior of the less important, usually of smaller mass, particles can be
considered collectively. In this approximation groups of identical particles,
sharing the same mass and structural parameters, operate as one unit. The
amount of grouping is determined by the zoom factor -- a free parameter that
determines on which particles the computational effort is focused. Two methods
for choosing the zoom factors are discussed: the `equal mass method,' in which
the groups trace the mass density of the distribution, and the `distribution
method,' which additionally follows fluctuations in the distribution. Both
methods achieve excellent correspondence with analytic solutions to the
Smoluchowski coagulation equation. The grouping method is furthermore applied
to simulations involving runaway kernels, where the particle interaction rate
is a strong function of particle mass, and to situations that include
catastrophic fragmentation. For the runaway simulations previous predictions
for the decrease of the runaway timescale with the initial number of particles
${\cal N}$ are reconfirmed, extending ${\cal N}$ to $10^{160}$. Astrophysical
applications include modeling of dust coagulation, planetesimal accretion, and
the dynamical evolution of stars in large globular clusters. The proposed
method is a powerful tool to compute the evolution of any system where the
particles interact through discrete events, with the particle properties
characterized by structural parameters.

learning domain and has many applications in different scientific areas. In
this paper, a theoretical framework for such estimation based on copula and
copula entropy -- the probabilistic theory of representation and measurement of
statistical dependence, is proposed. Graphical models are considered as a
special case of the copula framework. A method of the framework for estimating
maximum spanning copula is proposed. Due to copula, the method is irrelevant to
the properties of individual variables, insensitive to outlier and able to deal
with non-Gaussianity. Experiments on both simulated data and real dataset
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

effects can affect the region of parameters in which successful soft
leptogenesis induced by CP violation in the right-handed sneutrino mixing is
possible. We find that for decays which occur in the intermediate to strong
washout regimes for all flavours, the produced total $B-L$ asymmetry can be up
to a factor ${\cal O}(30)$ larger than the one predicted with flavour effects
being neglected. This enhancement, permits slightly larger values of the

clear bimodality present in most early-type galaxies; there may be a
significant population of intermediate-color objects. Of 13
spectroscopically-observed GCs, two are unusually metal-rich and feature bright
[O III] emission lines. We conclude that one probably hosts a planetary nebula
and the other a supernova remnant. Such emission line objects should be more
common in an intermediate-age stellar population than in an old one. We
therefore suggest that, in addition to the typical old metal-rich and old
metal-poor GC subpopulations, there may be a third subpopulation of
intermediate age. Such a subpopulation may have been formed ~2-3 Gyr ago, in
the same star-forming event that dominates the stellar population of the center
of the galaxy.

The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a collection of stellar evolution
tracks and isochrones that spans a range of [Fe/H] from -2.5 to +0.5,
[alpha/Fe] from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H] <=0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H] >0), and
initial He mass fractions from Y=0.245 to 0.40. Stellar evolution tracks were
computed for masses between 0.1 and 4 Msun, allowing isochrones to be generated
for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the core He flash
occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero age
horizontal branch. The tracks and isochrones have been transformed to the
observational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standard
UBV(RI)c, Stromgren uvby, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, and HST ACS-WFC and WFPC2.
The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is accessible through a website at

been fixed by physical and z=0 observational constraints, and thus our study
provides a genuine consistency test. The precise role of DLAs in galaxy
formation remains in debate, but they provide a number of strong constraints on
the nature of our simulated bound systems at z=3 because of their coupled
information on neutral H I densities, kinematics, metallicity and estimates of
star formation activity.
  Our results, without any parameter-tuning, closely match the observed
incidence rate and column density distributions of DLAs. Our simulations are
the first to reproduce the distribution of metallicities (with a median of
Z_{DLA} = Z_{solar}/20) without invoking observationally unsupported mechanisms
such as dust biasing. This is especially encouraging given that these
simulations have previously been shown to have a realistic 0<z<2 stellar
mass-metallicity relation. Additionally, we see a strong positive correlation
between sightline metallicity and low-ion velocity width, the normalization and
slope of which comes close to matching recent observational results. However,
we somewhat underestimate the number of observed high velocity width systems;
the severity of this disagreement is comparable to other recent DLA focused
studies. By z=0 the majority of the z=3 neutral gas forming the DLAs has been
converted into stars, in agreement with rough physical expectations.

that at frequencies >10^-8 Hz the frequency dependency of the generated

isolation of the group, defined as the distance to the nearest neighbor in
terms of its virial radius, and ii) the concentration, measured as the group
inner density calculated using the fifth nearest bright galaxy to the group
centre. Groups within narrow ranges of mass in the mock catalogue show
increasing group age with isolation and concentration. However, in the
observational data the stellar age, as indicated by the spectral type, only
shows a correlation with concentration. We study groups of similar mass and
different assembly history, finding important differences in their galaxy
population. Particularly, in high mass SDSS groups, the number of members,
mass-to-light ratios, red galaxy fractions and the magnitude difference between
the brightest and second brightest group galaxies, show different trends as a
function of isolation and concentration, even when it is expected that the
latter two quantities correlate with group age. Conversely, low mass SDSS
groups appear to be less sensitive to their assembly history. The correlations
detected in the SDSS are not consistent with the trends measured in the mock
catalogues. However, discrepancies can be explained in terms of the
disagreement found in the age-isolation trends, suggesting that the model might
be overestimating the effects of environment.We discuss how the modeling of the
cold gas in satellite galaxies could be responsible for this problem. These
results can be used to improve our understanding of the evolution of galaxies

avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as

suitable effective phantom fluid behaviour can emerge in brane cosmology; In
particular, within the normal non self-accelerating DGP branch, without any
exotic matter and due to curvature effects from induced gravity. The
phantom-like behaviour is based in defining an effective energy density that
grows as the brane expands. This effective description breaks down at some
point in the past when the effective energy density becomes negative and the
effective equation of state parameter blows up. In this paper we investigate if
the phantom-like regime can be enlarged by the inclusion of a Gauss-Bonnet (GB)

additional curvature effects on the brane setting. More precisely, our aim is
to determine if the GB term, dominating and modifying the early behaviour of
the brane universe, may eventually extend the regime of validity of the phantom
mimicry on the brane. However, we show that the opposite occurs: the GB effect
seems instead to induce a breakdown of the phantom-like behaviour at an even

the same interference-to-noise ratio, ${INR}={SNR}^\alpha$. We find that the

on the number of users, so that the characterization is identical to the 2 user
interference channel with the exception of a singularity at $\alpha=1$ where
$d(1)=\frac{1}{K}$. The achievable schemes use multilevel coding with a nested
lattice structure that opens the possibility that the sum of interfering
signals can be decoded at a receiver even though the messages carried by the
interfering signals are not decodable.

central 2x1.4 degree (~280x200 pc) of the Galaxy. At 3.6 and 4.5 um the
emission is dominated by stellar sources, the fainter ones merging into an
unresolved background. At 5.8 and 8 um the stellar sources are fainter, and
large-scale diffuse emission from the ISM of the Galaxy's central molecular
zone becomes prominent. The survey reveals that the 8 to 5.8 um color of the
ISM emission is highly uniform across the surveyed region. This uniform color
is consistent with a flat extinction law and emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Models indicate that this broadband color should not be
expected to change if the incident radiation field heating the dust and PAHs is
<10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. The few regions with unusually red
emission are areas where the PAHs are underabundant and the radiation field is
locally strong enough to heat large dust grains to produce significant 8 um
emission. These red regions include compact H II regions, Sgr B1, and wider
regions around the Arches and Quintuplet Clusters. In these regions the
radiation field is >10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. Other regions of
very red emission indicate cases where thick dust clouds obscure deeply
embedded objects or very early stages of star formation.

predictions, discuss the observed single planet systems, and suggest other
systems which may contain planets in between those that are already known. The
confirmation of the existence of HD 74156 d suggests that planet formation is
an efficient process, and planetary systems should typically contain many

establishing a one-to-one correspondence with the spectral labelings of the

sufficient condition for a spectral labeling to generate a spectrum (an

many previous results in the literature. In fact, most known examples of
orthonormal bases of exponentials correspond to spectral labelings satisfying
this sufficient condition. We also obtain two new conditions for a labeling
tree to generate a spectrum when other digits (digits not necessarily in $\{0,

If $\gamma_0, ..., \gamma_{n-1}$ are independent random variables with some
remarkable distributions, then the eigenvalues of the GGT matrix follow the
circular Jacobi distribution above.
  These deformed Verblunsky coefficients also allow to prove that, in the

the luminous member stars is most naturally explained if many formed from
molecular gas pushed and accelerated outwards by an expanding superbubble
driven presumably by stellar winds and perhaps also supernova explosions. A
large shell of atomic hydrogen gas and dust that lies just beyond the remnant
molecular clouds, believed to be driven by just such a superbubble, may
comprise the swept-up remains of the parental giant molecular cloud from which
this association formed. In support of this picture, we find a week trend for
the younger O star members to lie at higher galactic latitudes than the older

above the galactic plane presumably correspond to more recent episodes of star
formation at or near the periphery of this superbubble.

At every round of the game,
each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly
determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the
safety objective: ``stay forever in a set F of states'', and its dual, the
reachability objective, ``reach a set R of states''. We present in this paper a
strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety
game, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce the
safety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which
ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the
safety game.
  The significance of the result is twofold. First, while strategy improvement
algorithms were known for Markov decision processes and turn-based games, as
well as for concurrent reachability games, this is the first strategy
improvement algorithm for concurrent safety games. Second, and most
importantly, the improvement algorithm provides a way to approximate the value
of a concurrent safety game from below (the known value-iteration algorithms
approximate the value from above). Thus, when used together with
value-iteration algorithms, or with strategy improvement algorithms for
reachability games, our algorithm leads to the first practical algorithm for
computing converging upper and lower bounds for the value of reachability and

the spin fluctuation. From the AC magnetic susceptibility measurements, the
real part of the AC-susceptibility for H//(ab) exhibited the spin glass-like
behavior at low temperatures (T < 4 K). Remarkably, for an applied AC magnetic
field with H//(c)-axis, the sign of the AC magnetic susceptibility changed from
a positive to a negative value with increasing AC magnetic field frequency (f >
3 kHz) at low temperatures (T > 7 K). We interpret the sign change of AC
magnetic susceptibility along the (c)-axis in terms of the sudden sign reversal
of the phase difference from in-phase to out-of-phase response with an applied
AC magnetic field in the AC-susceptibility phase space.

BFI/SOT operate close to the diffraction limit and have only a rather small
stray-light contribution. The FWHM of the PSF is broadened by only ~1% with
respect to the diffraction-limited case, while the overall Strehl ratio is ~
0.8. In view of the large variations -- best seen in the residual intensities

that the migration behavior of embedded planets depends critically on the

not only changes the corotation torque on the planet, but also always
guarantees a departure from linear behavior, which gives a singular density
response at corotation, in the absence of thermal or viscous diffusion. A
negative entropy gradient tends to give rise to positive, non-linear corotation
torques apparently produced as material executes horseshoe turns at
approximately constant entropy. These torques have no counterpart in linear
theory, but can be strong enough to push the planet outwards until saturation
starts to occur after a horseshoe libration period. Increased thermal diffusion
acts to reduce these non-linear torques, but, at the same time, it can help to
prevent their saturation. In combination with a small kinematic viscosity that

trap the corresponding zero mode. This is a well-known conclusion which had
been discussed extensively in the literature. However, for the coupling
$\eta\bar{\Psi}\sin\phi \Psi$, the effective potential of the right chiral
fermions for positive $q$ and $\eta$ is no longer always positive. Although the
value of the potential at the location of the brane is still positive, it has a
series of wells and barriers on each side, which ensures that the right chiral
fermion zero mode could be trapped. Thus we may draw the remarkable conclusion:
for positive $\eta$ and $q$, the potentials of both the left and right chiral
fermions could trap the corresponding zero modes under certain restrictions.

scales with a fractal dimension that seems to be a constant around Df = 2.7. It
is expected that stars forming from this fractal medium exhibit similar fractal
patterns. Here we address this issue by quantifying the degree to which
star-forming events are clumped. We develop, test, and apply a precise and
accurate technique to calculate the correlation dimension Dc of the
distribution of HII regions in a sample of disk galaxies. We find that the
determination of Dc is limited by the number of HII regions, since if there are
< 100 regions available then a bias tending to underestimate the dimension is
produced. The reliable results are distributed in the range 1.5 < Dc < 2.0 with
an average value Dc = 1.81. This corresponds to a three-dimensional dimension
of Df = 2.73, very similar to the value measured in the interstellar clouds.
However, we get significant variations in the fractal dimension among galaxies,
contrary to a universal picture sometimes claimed in literature. The fractal
dimension exhibits a weak but significant correlation with the absolute
magnitude and, to a lesser extent, with the galactic radius. The faintest
galaxies tend to distribute their HII regions in more clustered (less uniform)
patterns. The fractal dimension for the brightest HII regions within the same
galaxy seems to be smaller than for the faintest ones suggesting some kind of
evolutionary efffect, but the obtained correlation remains unchanged if only
the brightest regions are taken into account.

transform two gas-rich dwarf irregulars into a new dwarf, which consists of a
spheroidal stellar component and a rotating extended HI disk. The remnant of
this dwarf-dwarf merging shows significantly different kinematics between stars
and gas, in the sense that a gas disk rotates rapidly while a stellar component
shows little rotation. We thus suggest that the simulated dwarf having a
dynamically hot spheroid and an extended gas disk finally evolves into the
present SMC after efficient stripping of the outer gas via tidal fields of the
Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also suggest that spatial
distributions and kinematics of RGB and AGB stars with different ages in the

oblate or prolate polarizability interaction due to the radiative field forces
the permanent dipole into alignment with the static field. Two mechanisms are
found to be responsible for the amplification of the molecules' orientation,
which ensues once the static field is turned on: (a) permanent-dipole coupling
of the opposite-parity tunneling doublets created by the oblate polarizability
interaction in collinear static and radiative fields; (b) hybridization of the
opposite parity states via the polarizability interaction and their coupling by
the permanent dipole interaction to the collinear or perpendicular static
field. In perpendicular fields, the oblate polarizability interaction, along
with the loss of cylindrical symmetry, is found to preclude the wrong-way
orientation, causing all states to become high-field seeking with respect to
the static field. The adiabatic labels of the states in the tilted fields
depend on the adiabatic path taken through the parameter space comprised of the
permanent and induced-dipole interaction parameters and the tilt angle between

VIMOS at the ESO VLT to a limiting magnitude I_AB=22.5, targeting four
independent fields with size up to 4 sq.deg. each. The whole survey covers 8.6
sq.deg., here we present the general properties of the current redshift sample.
This includes 32734 spectra in the four regions (19977 galaxies, 304 type I
AGNs, and 9913 stars), covering a total area of 6.1 sq.deg, with a sampling
rate of 22 to 24%. The redshift success rate is above 90% independently of

reaching z~1. We give the mean N(z) distribution averaged over 6.1 sq.deg.

~0.25 sq.deg. This level of cosmic variance agrees with that obtained by
integrating the galaxy two-point correlation function estimated from the F22

predicted by the Millennium mocks. The variance estimated over the survey
fields shows explicitly how clustering results from deep surveys of even ~1

astrophysical scenarios in which both, high magnetic fields and strong
gravitational fields appear, such as the magneto-rotational collapse of stellar
cores, the collapsar model of GRBs, and the evolution of neutron stars. The
code is based on an existing and thoroughly tested purely hydrodynamics code
and on its extension to accommodate weakly magnetized fluids (passive magnetic
field approximation). The numerical code we present here is based on
high-resolution shock-capturing schemes to solve the GRMHD equations together
with the flux constraint transport method to ensure the solenoidal condition of
the magnetic field. Since the astrophysical applications envisaged do not
deviate much from spherical symmetry, the conformal flatness condition
approximation is used for the formulation of the Einstein equations. In
addition, the code can handle several equations of state, from simple
analytical expressions to microphysical tabulated ones. In this paper we
present stringent tests of our new GRMHD numerical code, which show its ability
to handle all aspects appearing in the astrophysical scenarios for which the
code is intended, namely relativistic shocks, highly magnetized fluids, and
equilibrium configurations of magnetized neutron stars. As an application,
magneto-rotational core collapse simulations of a realistic progenitor are
presented, comparing the results with our previous finding in the passive

suppression of large-size QCD instantons - as evident from lattice data - is
due to a surviving conformal space-time inversion symmetry. This symmetry is
both suggested from the striking invariance of high-quality lattice data for
the instanton size distribution under inversion of the instanton size rho -->
<rho>^2 / rho and from the known validity of space-time inversion symmetry in
the classical instanton sector. We project the instanton calculus onto the
four-dimensional surface of a five-dimensional sphere via conformal
stereographic mapping, before investigating conformal inversion. This
projection to a compact, curved geometry is both to avoid the occurence of
divergences and to introduce the average instanton size <rho> from the lattice
data as a new length scale. The average instanton size is identified with the
radius b of this 5d-sphere and acts as the conformal inversion radius. For b =
<rho>, our corresponding results are almost perfectly symmetric under
space-time inversion and in good qualitative agreement with the lattice data.
For rho / b --> 0, we recover the familiar results of instanton perturbation
theory in flat 4d-space. Moreover, we illustrate that a (weakly broken)
conformal inversion symmetry would have significant consequences for QCD beyond
instantons. As a further successful test for inversion symmetry, we present
striking implications for another instanton dominated lattice observable, the
chirality-flip ratio in the QCD vacuum.

ideas of black hole thermodynamics. In this note, we numerically scan for
phases that are in equilibrium by extremizing total entropy in the
2-dimensional moduli space of stationary, singly rotating black Saturns with
fixed total mass and angular momentum. On top of the known T_H=T_R,
Omega_H=Omega_R configurations, we find phases that do not balance the
temperature and angular velocity of the ring and the hole. But these (and most
of the balanced Saturns) go away when we demand that the system is metastable,
by imposing that the Hessian of the entropy is negative definite. Metastablity
occurs when the dimensionless total angular momentum lies in a narrow window
0.92457<j<0.92463 of the thin ring branch. This is consistent with the expected
range of classical stability of black Saturns and therefore may imply that
thermal stability is tied to classical stability, in analogy with Gubser-Mitra
in the translationally-invariant case. We also comment on the possibility of
constructing plasma configurations that are dual to black Saturns in AdS.

to the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. However a rare subset of sun-like stars possess
dust which lies in the terrestrial planet region. In this study we aim to
determine how many sources with apparent mid-IR excess are truly hosts of warm
dust, and investigate where the dust must lie. We observed using mid-IR imaging
with TIMMI2, VISIR and MICHELLE a sample of FGK main sequence stars reported to
have hot dust. A new modelling approach was developed to determine the
constraints that can be set on the radial extent of excess emission. We confirm
the presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates (eta Corvi, HD145263 and
HD202406), and present constraints on the emitting dust regions. Of 2
alternative models for the eta Corvi excess emission, we find that a model with
1 hot dust component at <3 AU (combined with the known submm dust population)
fits the data better at the 2.6sigma level than an alternative model with 2
populations of dust in the mid-IR. We identify several systems which have a
companion (HD65277 and HD79873) or background object (HD53246, HD123356 and
HD128400) responsible for their mid-infrared excess, and for 3 other systems we
were able to rule out a point-like source near the star at the level of excess
observed in lower resolution observations (HD12039, HD69830 and HD191089). Hot
dust sources are either young and possibly primordial or transitional, or have
relatively small radius steady-state planetesimal belts, or they are old and
luminous with transient emission. High resolution imaging can be used to
constrain the location of the disk and help to discriminate between different
models of disk emission. For some small disks, interferometry is needed to
resolve the disk location.

unperturbed. We compare predictions for the perturbed neutrino TBM parameters
with those obtained from typical SO(10) grand unified theories with a variety
of flavor symmetries. Whereas SO(10) GUTs almost always predict a normal mass
hierarchy for the light neutrinos, TBM has a priori no preference for neutrino
masses. We find, in particular for the latter, that the value of |U_{e3}| is
very sensitive to the neutrino mass scale and ordering. Observation of
|U_{e3}|^2 > 0.001 to 0.01 within the next few years would be incompatible with
softly-broken TBM and a normal mass hierarchy and would suggest that the
apparent TBM symmetry is an accidental symmetry instead. No such conclusions
can be drawn for the inverted and quasi-degenerate hierarchy spectra.

that SMBHs can receive kicks up to several thousand km\s due to anisotropic
emission of gravitational waves during the coalescence of a binary. Our
detection of a strong candidate for a rapidly recoiling SMBH implies that kicks
large enough to remove SMBHs completely from their host galaxies do occur, with
important implications for models of black hole and galaxy assembly at the

A spectrum becomes steeper at frequencies above 5 GHz, where the spectral index
changes from -0.70 to -0.82. Millimeter emission from the core of Centaurus A
is variable, and correlates appreciably better with the 20-200 keV than the 2 -
10 keV X-ray variability. In its quiescent state, the core spectral index is
-0.3, which steepens when the core brightens. The variability appears to be
mostly associated with the inner nuclear jet components that have been detected
in VLBI measurements. The densest nuclear components are optically thick below
45-80 GHz.

resembling a halo around the Galactic center. These sources are highly
variable, and hence they should be associated with compact objects.
Microquasars are objects undergoing accretion with relativistic jets; if such
an object has a low-mass, evolved, donor star, it might be found in the
Galactic halo. If these low-mass microquasars can generate detectable gamma-ray
emission, then they are natural candidates to account for the halo high-energy
sources. We aim to construct models for high-energy emission of low-mass
microquasars, which could produce a significant luminosity in the gamma-ray
domain. We consider that a significant fraction of the relativistic particles
in the jets of low-mass microquasars are protons and then we study the
production of high-energy emission through proton synchrotron radiation and
photopion production. Photopair production and leptonic processes are
considered as well. We compute a number of specific models with different
parameters to explore the possibilities of this scenario.} We find that
important luminosities, in the range of $10^{34}-10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, can be
achieved by proton synchrotron radiation in the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space

at higher energies for some models. We conclude that the ""proton microquasar""

regime where disk geometry and dynamics set the scale for structure. On smaller
scales, the correlation functions for each galaxy are scale-free over at least
two orders of magnitude, with a projected correlation dimension varying from
1.0 for M31 to 1.8 for the SMC. This variation is probably caused by a

  247-255",,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, a new method for encoding data sets in the form of ""Density Codes""
was proposed in the literature (Courrieu, 2006). This method allows to compare
sets of points belonging to every multidimensional space, and to build shape
spaces invariant to a wide variety of affine and non-affine transformations.
However, this general method does not take advantage of the special properties
of image data, resulting in a quite slow encoding process that makes this tool
practically unusable for processing large image databases with conventional
computers. This paper proposes a very simple variant of the density code method
that directly works on the image function, which is thousands times faster than
the original Parzen window based method, without loss of its useful properties.

indentified five spectral features, which are grouped into red-shifted (-1.9

rapid variabilities of these maser features within a monitoring period of 81
days. The red-shifted features decreased in flux density to 50% of its initial
value, while the flux density of the blue-shifted features rapidly increased
within a 30 days. The time variation of these maser features showed two
remarkable properties; synchronization and anti-correlation between the
red-shifted and the blue-shifted. The spatial distribution of the maser spots
obtained by the JVN observation showed an arclike structure with a scale of
$\sim$1400 AU, and separations of the five maser features were found to be
larger than 100 AU. The absolute position of the methanol maser was also
obtained based on the phase-referencing observations, and the arclike structure
were found to be associated with the Cep A-HW2 object, with the elongation of
the arclike structure nearly perpendicularly to the radio continuum jet from
the Cep A-HW2 object. These properties of the masers, namely, the
synchronization of flux variation, and the spectral and spatial isolation of
features, suggest that the collisional excitation by shock wave from a common
exciting source is unlikely. Instead, the synchronized time variation of the
masers can be explained if all the maser features are excited by infrared
radiation from dust which is heated by a common exciting source with a rapid
variability.

make a diagnostic of active and eruptive prominences. One motivation for this
work is to identify the physical conditions during prominence activation and
eruption. Hydrogen and helium lines are key in probing different parts of the
prominence structure and inferring the plasma parameters. However, the
interpretation of observations, being either spectroscopic or obtained with
imaging, is not straightforward. Their resonance lines are optically thick, and
the prominence plasma is out of local thermodynamic equilibrium due to the
strong incident radiation coming from the solar disk. In view of the shift of
the incident radiation occurring when the prominence plasma flows radially, it
is essential to take into account velocity fields in the prominence diagnostic.
Therefore we need to investigate the effects of the radial motion of the
prominence plasma on hydrogen and helium lines. The method that we use is the
resolution of the radiative transfer problem in the hydrogen and helium lines
out of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We study the variation of the computed
integrated intensities in H and He lines with the radial velocity of the
prominence plasma. We can confirm that there exist suitable lines which can be
used to make a diagnostic of the plasma in active and eruptive prominences in
the presence of velocity fields.
