between a single qubit and its environment, as well as for pairs of qubits
interacting independently with individual environments, using photons obtained
from parametric down-conversion. The qubits are encoded in the polarizations of
single photons, while the interaction with the environment is implemented by
coupling the polarization of each photon with its momentum. A convenient Sagnac
interferometer allows for the implementation of several decoherence channels
and for the continuous monitoring of the environment. For an
initially-entangled photon pair, one observes the vanishing of entanglement
before coherence disappears. For a single qubit interacting with an
environment, the dynamics of complementarity relations connecting single-qubit
properties and its entanglement with the environment is experimentally
determined. The evolution of a single qubit under continuous monitoring of the
environment is investigated, demonstrating that a qubit may decay even when the
environment is found in the unexcited state. This implies that entanglement can
be increased by local continuous monitoring, which is equivalent to
entanglement distillation. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer
of entanglement from the two-qubit system to the two corresponding
environments, between which entanglement may suddenly appear, and show
instances for which no entanglement is created between dephasing environments,
nor between each of them and the corresponding qubit: the initial two-qubit
entanglement gets transformed into legitimate multiqubit entanglement of the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type.

  The new Delta-variance algorithm is based on an appropriate filtering of the
data in Fourier space. It allows us to distinguish the influence of variable
noise from the actual small-scale structure in the maps and it helps for
dealing with the boundary problem in non-periodic and/or irregularly bounded
maps. We try several wavelets and test their spatial sensitivity using
artificial maps with well known structure sizes.
  It turns out that different wavelets show different strengths with respect to
detecting characteristic structures and spectral indices, i.e. different
aspects of map structures. As a reasonable universal compromise for the optimum

observable consequences. For a scalar field on expanding space, we show that
relaxation to quantum equilibrium (in de Broglie-Bohm theory) is suppressed for
field modes whose quantum time evolution satisfies a certain inequality,
resulting in a 'freezing' of early quantum nonequilibrium for these particular
modes. For an early radiation-dominated expansion, the inequality implies a
corresponding physical wavelength that is larger than the (instantaneous)
Hubble radius. These results make it possible, for the first time, to make
quantitative predictions for nonequilibrium deviations from quantum theory, in
the context of specific cosmological models. We discuss some possible

infrared limits of this class of theories interpolate between weakly and

the topology of the adjoint Higgs field by turning it into a compact scalar

the depletions of other molecules, especially C2H2 and HCN. We suggest that the

Here we suggest explanations by considering the X-rays as arising from bow
shocks that occur where the stellar wind impacts on spherical clumps in the
winds. We use an accurate and stable numerical hydrodynamical code to obtain
steady-state physical conditions for the temperature and density structure in a
bow shock. We use these solutions plus analytic approximations to interpret
some major X-ray features: the simple power-law distribution of the observed
emission measure derived from many hot star X-ray spectra and the wide range of
ionization stages that appear to be present in X-ray sources throughout the
winds. Also associated with the adiabatic cooling of the gas around a clump is
a significant transverse velocity for the hot plasma flow around the clumps,
and this can help to understand anomalies associated with observed line widths,
and the differences in widths seen in stars with high and low mass-loss rates.
The differences between bow shocks and the planar shocks that are often used
for hot stars are discussed. We introduce an ``on the shock'' (OTSh)
approximation that is useful for interpreting the X-rays and the consequences
of clumps in hot star winds and elsewhere in astronomy.

blueshifted Mg II 2796, 2803 A absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxies
at this epoch. This is the first detection of frequent outflowing galactic
winds at z~1. The presence and depth of absorption are independent of AGN
spectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisite
for driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. Outflows are found in
coadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x in
star formation rate (SFR), calibrated from K-band and from MIPS IR fluxes. The
outflows have column densities of order N_H ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristic
velocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in the
most massive, highest SFR galaxies. The velocities suggest that the outflowing
gas can escape into the IGM and that massive galaxies can produce
cosmologically and chemically significant outflows. Both the Mg II equivalent
width and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar mass
and SFR, with V_wind ~ SFR^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshift
IR-luminous galaxies. The high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxy
population at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors of
massive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. The increase of outflow
velocity with mass and SFR constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolution
that include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven models
for the wind physics.

particles over a period of four billion years, we follow the evolution of the
location of the midplane of the Kuiper belt. The Classical Kuiper belt conforms
to a warped sheet that precesses with a 1.9 Myr period. The present-day
location of the Kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular
perturbation theory: the local normal to the plane is given by the theory's
forced inclination vector, which is specific to every semimajor axis. The
Kuiper belt plane does not coincide with the invariable plane, but deviates
from it by up to a few degrees in stable zones. For example, at a semimajor
axis of 38 AU, the local Kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1.9 deg and a
longitude of ascending node of 149.9 deg when referred to the mean ecliptic and
equinox of J2000. At a semimajor axis of 43 AU, the local plane has an
inclination of 1.9 deg and a nodal longitude of 78.3 deg. Only at infinite
semimajor axis does the Kuiper belt plane merge with the invariable plane,
whose inclination is 1.6 deg and nodal longitude is 107.7 deg. A Kuiper belt
object keeps its inclination relative to the Kuiper belt plane nearly constant,
even while the latter plane departs from the trajectory predicted by linear
theory. The constancy of relative inclination reflects the undamped amplitude
of free oscillation. Current observations of Classical Kuiper belt objects are
consistent with the plane being warped by the giant planets alone, but the
sample size will need to increase by a few times before confirmation exceeds
3-sigma in confidence. In principle, differences between the theoretically
expected plane and the observed plane could be used to infer as yet unseen
masses orbiting the Sun, but carrying out such a program would be challenging.

preamplifier pulse with two amplifiers with largely differing shaping times,
using a fast peak-sensing ADC. For the injected charges corresponding to energy
deposits in silicon detectors of a few tens of MeV, a rise time resolution of
the order of 1 ns can be achieved. The identification method is applicable in
particle experiments involving large-area silicon detectors, but is easily
adaptable to other detectors with a response corresponding to significantly
different pulse rise times for different particle species.

rise to a false interpretation of experimental observations in terms of phase

gas orbits supersonically through a fixed grid. As a result the time step is
sharply limited by the Courant condition. Also, because the mean flow speed
with respect to the grid varies with position, the truncation error varies
systematically with position. For hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) disks an
algorithm called FARGO has been developed that advects the gas along its mean
orbit using a separate interpolation substep. This relaxes the constraint
imposed by the Courant condition, which now depends only on the peculiar
velocity of the gas, and results in a truncation error that is more nearly
independent of position. This paper describes a FARGO-like algorithm suitable
for evolving magnetized disks. Our method is second order accurate on a smooth
flow and preserves the divergence-free constraint to machine precision. The
main restriction is that the magnetic field must be discretized on a staggered
mesh. We give a detailed description of an implementation of the code and
demonstrate that it produces the expected results on linear and nonlinear
problems. We also point out how the scheme might be generalized to make the
integration of other supersonic/super-fast flows more efficient. Although our
scheme reduces the variation of truncation error with position, it does not
eliminate it. We show that the residual position dependence leads to
characteristic radial variations in the density over long integrations.

Finally, in the intermediate regime where K=\Theta(\log n), the threshold has

of the light can be inferred. How to find the optimal demodulation process has
been investigated in the past. However, since the modulation matrix has to be
measured for a given instrument and the optical elements can present problems
of repeatability, some uncertainty is present in the elements of the modulation
matrix and/or covariances between these elements. We analyze in detail this
issue, presenting analytical formulae for calculating the covariance matrix
produced by the propagation of such uncertainties on the demodulation matrix,
on the inferred Stokes parameters and on the efficiency of the modulation

matrix is diagonal, the covariance matrix of the demodulation matrix is, in
general, non-diagonal because matrix inversion is a nonlinear operation. This
propagates through the demodulation process and induces correlations on the

assumption $\mu_I = {\cal O} (N_c^0)$, the proton and neutron masses are
nonlinear in $\mu_I$ in the regime $|\mu_I| < m_\pi$. Although these

strictly agree with the very robust prediction that for those values of $\mui$
the energy excitations above the vacuum are linear in $\mu_I$. The resolution
of this paradox is achieved by studying the realization of the large $N_c$
limit of $QCD$ in the Skyrme model at finite $\mui$. This is done in a
simplified context devoid of the technical complications present in the Skyrme
model but which fully displays the general scaling behavior with $N_c$. The
analysis shows that the paradoxical result appears as a symptom of using the
semi-classical approach beyond its regime of validity and that, at a formal
level, the standard methods for dealing with the Skyrme model are only strictly
justified for states of high isospin $I \sim N_c$.

about the possible effects on the CR primary and secondary spectra and also the

assume that CRs undergo diffusive propagation in the Galaxy and we neglect the
effect of convection, energy losses and reacceleration. In our model, we assume
that there exists a uniform and continuous distribution of CR sources in the
Galaxy generating a stationary CR background at the Earth. In addition, we also
consider the existence of some nearby sources which inject CRs in a discrete
space-time model. Assuming a constant CR source power throughout the Galaxy,
our study has found that the presence of nearby supernova remnants (SNRs)
produces noticeable variations in the primary fluxes mainly above ~ 100 GeV/n,
if CRs are assumed to be released instantaneously after the supernova
explosion. The variation reaches a value of ~ 45% at around 10^5 GeV/n. Respect
to earlier studies, the variation in the case of the secondaries is found to be
almost negligible. We also discuss about the possible effects of the different
particle release times from the SNRs. For the particle release time of ~ 10^5
yr, predicted by the diffusive shock acceleration theories in SNRs, we have
found that the presence of the nearby SNRs hardly produces any significant

deteriorating condition numbers of (kernel) smoothed periodogram matrices.
Moreover, shrinking the empirical eigenvalues in the frequency domain towards
one another also improves at the same time the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
these widely used nonparametric spectral estimators. Compared to some existing
time domain approaches, restricted to i.i.d. data, in the frequency domain it
is necessary to take the size of the smoothing span as ""effective or local
sample size"" into account. While B\""{o}hm and von Sachs (2007) proposes a
multiple of the identity matrix as optimal shrinkage target in the absence of
knowledge about the multidimensional structure of the data, here we consider
""structural"" shrinkage. We assume that the spectral structure of the data is
induced by underlying factors. However, in contrast to actual factor modelling
suffering from the need to choose the number of factors, we suggest a
model-free approach. Our final estimator is the asymptotically MSE-optimal
linear combination of the smoothed periodogram and the parametric estimator
based on an underfitting (and hence deliberately misspecified) factor model. We
complete our theoretical considerations by some extensive simulation studies.
In the situation of data generated from a higher-order factor model, we compare

photodissociation region. Our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of H2
is clearly different around most of the HAeBes compared to the interstellar
medium. Moreover, the characteristics of H2 around Herbig Ae and Be stars give
evidence for different excitation mechanisms. For the most massive stars of our
sample (B8 to B2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a model
of photodissociation regions (PDR). Our results favor an interpretation in
terms of large CS envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which the
stars were formed. On the other hand, the group of Ae stars (later than B9
type) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. In most cases, when CS H2
is detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. The excitation
conditions of H2 around Ae stars cannot be reproduced by PDR models and
correspond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. In
addition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars and
the amount of circumstellar H2. Our results suggest structural differences
between Herbig Ae and Be star environments. Herbig Be stars do evolve faster
than Ae stars, and consequently, most Herbig Be stars are younger than Ae ones

down to 30 K, suggesting the development of AFM spin fluctuations with
decreasing temperature. In the 11% F-doped sample, in contrast, pseudogap
behavior is observed in 1/T_1T both at the ^{75}As and ^{139}La site with a gap
value of ~172 K. The spin dynamics vary markedly with F doping, which is
ascribed to the Fermi-surface structure. As for the superconducting properties
for the 4% and 11% F-doped samples, 1/T_1 in both compounds does not exhibit a
coherence peak just below T_c and follows a T^3 dependence at low temperatures,
which suggests unconventional superconductivity with line-nodes. We discuss
similarities and differences between La(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs and cuprates, and
also discuss the relationship between spin dynamics and superconductivity on
the basis of F doping dependence of T_c and 1/T_1.

is a closed orientable 3-manifold and G is a trivalent graph embedded in M.
  To enumerate the pairs we use a variation of Matveev's definition of
complexity for 3-manifolds, and we consider only (0,1,2)-irreducible pairs,
namely pairs (M,G) such that any 2-sphere in M intersecting G transversely in
at most 2 points bounds a ball in M either disjoint from G or intersecting G in
an unknotted arc. To classify the pairs our main tools are geometric invariants
defined using hyperbolic geometry. In most cases, the graph complement admits a
unique hyperbolic structure with parabolic meridians; this structure was
computed and studied using Heard's program Orb and Goodman's program Snap.
  We determine all (0,1,2)-irreducible pairs up to complexity 5, allowing
disconnected graphs but forbidding components without vertices in complexity 5.
The result is a list of 129 pairs, of which 123 are hyperbolic with parabolic
meridians. For these pairs we give detailed information on hyperbolic
invariants including volumes, symmetry groups and arithmetic invariants.
Pictures of all hyperbolic graphs up to complexity 4 are provided. We also
include a partial analysis of knots and links.
  The theoretical framework underlying the paper is twofold, being based on
Matveev's theory of spines and on Thurston's idea (later developed by several
authors) of constructing hyperbolic structures via triangulations. Many of our
results were obtained (or suggested) by computer investigations.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200809863",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical novae are expected to emit gamma rays during their explosions. The
most important contribution to the early gamma-ray emission comes from the
annihilation with electrons of the positrons generated by the decay of 13N and
18F. The photons are expected to be down-scattered to a few tens of keV, and
the emission is predicted to occur some days before the visual discovery and to
last ~2 days. Despite a number of attempts, no positive detections of such
emission have been made, due to lack of sensitivity and of sky coverage.
Because of its huge field of view, good sensitivity, and well-adapted energy
band, Swift/BAT offers a new opportunity for such searches. BAT data can be
retrospectively used to search for prompt gamma-ray emission from the direction
of novae after their optical discovery. We have estimated the expected success
rate for the detection with BAT of gamma rays from classical novae using a
Monte Carlo approach. Searches were performed for emission from novae occurring
since the launch of Swift. Using the actual observing program during the first
2.3 years of BAT operations as an example, and sensitivity achieved, we
estimate the expected rate of detection of classical novae with BAT as
~0.2-0.5/yr, implying that several should be seen within a 10 yr mission. The
search for emission in the directions of the 24 classical novae discovered
since the Swift launch yielded no positive results, but none of these was known
to be close enough for this to be a surprise. Detections of a recurrent nova
(RS Oph) and a nearby dwarf nova (V455 And) demonstrate the efficacy of the
technique. The absence of detections is consistent with the expectations from
the Monte Carlo simulations, but the long-term prospects are encouraging given
an anticipated Swift operating lifetime of ~10 years.

the classical equations for the brane profile and the tachyon condensate. An
ultraviolet cut-off turns out to be essential because the numerical solutions
tend to rapidly diverge from the desired asymptotic solutions, beyond a
sufficiently large value of the holographic coordinate. The required cut-off is
determined by the non-normalizable part of the tachyon and is parametrically
far smaller than that dictated by consistency of a description in terms of
10-dimensional bulk gravity. In arXiv:0708.3233 we had argued that the solution
in which the tachyon field goes to infinity at the point where the brane and
antibrane meet has only one free parameter, which may be taken to be the
asymptotic brane-antibrane separation. Here we present numerical evidence in
favour of this observation. We also present evidence that the non-normalizable
part of the asymptotic tachyon solution, which is identified with quark mass in
the QCD-like boundary theory, is determined by this parameter. We show that the
normalizable part of the asymptotic tachyon solution determines the quark
condensate, but this requires holographic renormalization of the on-shell
boundary brane action because of the presence of infinite cut-off dependent
terms. Our renormalization scheme gives an exponential dependence on the
cut-off to the quark mass. We also discuss meson spectra in detail and show
that the pion mass is nonzero and satisfies the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation

a superintense laser field of linear polarization is considered. The minimum
laser intensity required amounts to a few 10^22 W/cm^2 in the near-infrared
frequency range. Within the framework of laser-dressed quantum electrodynamics,
the total reaction rate is calculated and related to the cross section for
field-free electron-positron annihilation into muons. The muons are created
with ultrarelativistic energies and emitted under narrow angles along the laser
propagation direction. The dynamical properties of the muons are interpreted in
terms of a classical simple man's model for the production process. We show
that the most promising setup for an experimental investigation of the process
employs two counterpropagating laser beams impinging on a positronium target,
where the advantage of the coherent electron-positron collisions becomes
evident.

This online problem arises, e.g.,
in the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.
  The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The player
is initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary
pours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices
of the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player
then moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at
that vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the
maximum amount of water in any cup at any time.
  The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are
points in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at
a constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the
player's objective is to minimize the backlog.
  We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower
bound of $\Omega(D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete
MBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we
focus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper
bound on the absolute value of the backlog.
  For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of
$\Omega(D)$, and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an
upper bound of $O(D\log N)$ for $N$ cups. Our main result is a tight upper
bound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player
that guarantees a backlog of $O(D)$, independently of the number of cups.

a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete

optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is
implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral

out to R = 60 kpc. Methods: Our analysis is based on parameters for the warp
and rotation curve derived previously. The data are taken from the
Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. Results: The Milky Way HI disk
is significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to R = 35 kpc. The
radial surface density distribution, the densities in the middle of the warped
plane, and the HI scale heights all follow exponential relations. The radial
scale length for the surface density distribution of the HI disk is 3.75 kpc.
Gas at the outskirts for 40 < R < 60 kpc is described best by a distribution
with an exponential radial scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of
74 km/s. Such a highly turbulent medium fits also well with the average shape
of the high velocity profile wings observed at high latitudes. The turbulent
pressure gradient of such extra-planar gas is on average in balance with the
gravitational forces. About 10% of the Milky Way HI gas is in this state. The
large scale HI distribution is lopsided; for R < 15 kpc there is more gas in
the south. The HI flaring indicates that this asymmetry is caused by a dark
matter wake, located at R = 25 kpc in direction of the Magellanic System.
Conclusions: The HI disk is made up of two major components. Most prominent is
the normal HI disk which can be traced to R = 35 kpc. This is surrounded by a
patchy distribution of highly turbulent gas reaching large scale heights but
also large radial distances. At the position of the Sun the exponential scale
height in the z direction is 3.9 kpc. This component resembles the anomalous
gas discovered previously in some galaxies.

conductance staircase that is caused by silicon one-dimensional channels
prepared by the split-gate method inside the p-type silicon quantum well (SQW)
on the n-type Si (100) surface. Firstly, the interplay of the spin
depolarisation with the evolution of the 0.7(2e2/h) feature from the e2/h to
3/2 e2/h values as a function of the sheet density of holes is revealed by the
quantum point contact connecting two 2D reservoirs in the p-type SQW. The 1D
holes are demonstrated to be spin-polarised at low sheet density, because the
0.7(2e2/h) feature is close to the value of 0.5(2e2/h) that indicates the spin
degeneracy lifting for the first step of the quantum conductance staircase. The
0.7(2e2/h) feature is found to take however the value of 0.75(2e2/h) when the
sheet density increases thereby giving rise to the spin depolarisation of the
1D holes. Secondly, the amplitude and phase sensitivity of the 0.7(2e2/h)
feature are studied by varying the value of the external magnetic field and the
top gate voltage that are applied perpendicularly to the plane of the
double-slit ring embedded in the p-type SQW, with the extra quantum point
contact inserted in the one of its arms. The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) and the
Aharonov-Casher (AC) conductance oscillations obtained are evidence of the
interplay of the spontaneous spin polarisation and the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) in the formation of the 0.7(2e2/h) feature. Finally, the
variations of the 0.7(2e2/h) feature caused by the Rashba SOI are found to take
in the fractional form with both the plateaux and steps as a function of the
top gate voltage.

a step towards a vertex it has already visited. Prudent walks differ from most
classes of SAW that have been counted so far in that they can wind around their
starting point. Their enumeration was first addressed by Pr\'ea in 1997. He
defined 4 classes of prudent walks, of increasing generality, and wrote a
system of recurrence relations for each of them . However, these relations
involve more and more parameters as the generality of the class increases. The
first class actually consists of partially directed walks, and its generating
function is well-known to be rational. The second class was proved to have an
algebraic (quadratic) generating function by Duchi (2005). Here, we solve
exactly the third class, which turns out to be much more complex: its
generating function is not algebraic, nor even D-finite. The fourth class --
general prudent walks -- is the only isotropic one, and still defeats us.
However, we design an isotropic family of prudent walks on the triangular
lattice, which we count exactly. Again, the generating function is proved to be
non-D-finite. We also study the asymptotic properties of these classes of
walks, with the (somewhat disappointing) conclusion that their endpoint moves
away from the origin at a positive speed. This is confirmed visually by the
random generation procedures we have designed.

quantum mechanics by deriving it from Bohr's doctrine of classical concepts,
translated into the following mathematical statement: a quantum system
described by a noncommutative C*-algebra of observables is empirically
accessible only through associated commutative C*-algebras. The Born
probabilities emerge as the relative frequencies of outcomes in long runs of
measurements on a quantum system; it is not necessary to adopt the frequency
interpretation of single-case probabilities (which will be the subject of a
sequel paper). Our derivation of the Born rule uses ideas from a program begun
by Finkelstein (1965) and Hartle (1968), intending to remove the Born rule as a
separate postulate of quantum mechanics. Mathematically speaking, our approach
refines previous elaborations of this program - notably the one due to Farhi,
Goldstone, and Gutmann (1989) as completed by Van Wesep (2006) - in replacing
infinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces by continuous fields of C*-algebras.
In combination with our interpretational context, this technical improvement
circumvents valid criticisms that earlier derivations of the Born rule have
provoked, especially to the effect that such derivations were mathematically
flawed as well as circular. Furthermore, instead of relying on the
controversial eigenvector-eigenvalue link in quantum theory, our derivation
just assumes that pure states in classical physics have the usual
interpretation as truthmakers that assign sharp values to observables.

congestion and improve throughput on a freeway are analyzed. In the first
scheme, drivers choose to merge or to divert to a downstream on-ramp based on
information about average travel times for the two routes: (1) merge and travel
on the freeway or (2) divert and travel on a surface street with merging
downstream. The flow, rate of merging at the ramps, and the travel times
oscillate strongly, but irregularly, due to delayed feedback. In the second
scheme, diversion is controlled by the average mainline velocities just
upstream of the on-ramps. Driver choice is not involved. If the average
upstream velocity on the mainline drops below a predetermined value (20 m/s)
vehicles are diverted to the downstream ramp. When the average mainline
velocity downstream becomes too low, diversion is no longer permitted. The
resultant oscillations in this scheme are nearly periodic. The period is
dominated by the response time of the mainline to interruption of merging
rather than delayed feedback, which contributes only a minor component linear
in the distance separating the on-ramps. In general the second scheme produces
more effective congestion reduction and greater throughput. Also the travel
times for on-ramp drivers are less than that obtained by drivers who attempt to
minimize their own travel times (first scheme).

functions involved have a negative Schwarzian derivative. In this paper we
consider a generalization of this condition. Specifically, we consider the
interval functions of a real variable having some iterate with a negative
Schwarzian derivative and show that many known results generalize to this
larger class of functions. The introduction of this class was motivated by some
maps arising in neuroscience.
