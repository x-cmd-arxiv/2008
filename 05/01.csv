causes a significant reduction of the allowed range of $\Delta m^2_{21}$,
determining it with an unprecedented precision of 8.3% at 3$\sigma$. The
precision of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ is controlled practically by the KamLAND data
alone. Inclusion of new KamLAND results also improves the upper bound on
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$, but the precision of this parameter continues to be
controlled by the solar data. The third mixing angle is constrained to be
$\sin^2\theta_{13} < 0.063$ at $3\sigma$ from a combined fit to the solar,
KamLAND, atmospheric and CHOOZ results. We also address the issue of how much
further reduction of allowed range of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$
is possible with increased statistics from KamLAND. We find that there is a
sharp reduction of the $3\sigma$ ``spread'' with enhanced statistics till about
10 KTy after which the spread tends to flatten out reaching to less than 4%
with 15 KTy data. For $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ however, the spread is more than 25%

well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication
complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite
measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets
an input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output
a,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).
  We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity
distributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which
gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum
communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.
We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they
coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual
expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These
lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,
most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special
case of Boolean functions.
  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at
most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend
on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between
maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known
only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.
  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical
communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any
non-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum
distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of
communication.

by the EUVI/SECCHI imagers on board the twin STEREO spacecraft. The
significantly separated viewpoints ($\sim$ 11$^\circ$) allowed us to infer the
3D dynamics and morphology of a well-defined EUV coronal jet for the first
time. Triangulations of the jet's location in simultaneous image pairs led to
the true 3D position and thereby its kinematics. Initially the jet ascends
slowly at $\approx$10-20 $\mathrm{{km} {s}^{-1}}$ and then, after an apparent
'jump' takes place, it accelerates impulsively to velocities exceeding 300
$\mathrm{{km} {s}^{-1}}$ with accelerations exceeding the solar gravity.
Helical structure is the most important geometrical feature of the jet which
shows evidence of untwisting. The jet structure appears strikingly different
from each of the two STEREO viewpoints: face-on in the one viewpoint and
edge-on in the other. This provides conclusive evidence that the observed
helical structure is real and is not resulting from possible projection effects
of single viewpoint observations. The clear demonstration of twisted structure
in polar jets compares favorably with synthetic images from a recent MHD
simulation of jets invoking magnetic untwisting as their driving mechanism.
Therefore, the latter can be considered as a viable mechanism for the
initiation of polar jets.

  In particular it allows to show the existence of a solution $({\bf u},p)\in

  It is known that the above mentioned result holds when $\Omega$ is a

  In this paper we prove that if $\Omega$ is a planar simply connected

the particular case of domains with an external cusp of power type, we prove
that our weaker boundary condition is equivalent to the standard one. In this

separate fields of our UDF05 HST NICMOS images. These z~7 Lyman-Break Galaxy
(LBG) candidates allow us to constrain the Luminosity Function (LF) of the star
forming galaxy population at those epochs. By assuming a change in only M* and
adopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values at
z~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unit
redshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a value
of M*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. This implies a steady evolution for the LBG LF out to
z~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. This
puts a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whose
ensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 Myr
before the epoch at which they are observed. In particular, a large fraction of
stars in the z~6 LBG population must form at redshifts well above z~7.
Extrapolating this steady evolution of the LF out to higher redshifts, we
estimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, provided
that the faint-end slope of the z>7 LF steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faint
galaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute a
substantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. This scenario gives
however an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigma
below the WMAP-5 measurement. Therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,
should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either the
currently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z>7, or the
LF evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and a
corresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

hydrodynamic turbulence simulation with prominent density and velocity
structures, ii) an observed intensity map of rho Oph with irregular boundaries
and variable uncertainties of the different data points, and iii) a map of the
turbulent velocity structure in the Polaris Flare affected by the intensity
dependence on the centroid velocity determination.
  The tests confirm the extended capabilities of the improved Delta-variance
analysis. Prominent spatial scales were accurately identified and artifacts
from a variable reliability of the data were removed. The analysis of the
hydrodynamic simulations showed that the injection of a turbulent velocity
structure creates the most prominent density structures are produced on a scale
somewhat below the injection scale. The new analysis of a rho Oph continuum map
reveals an intermediate stage in the molecular cloud evolution showing both
signatures of the typical molecular cloud scaling behaviour and the formation
of condensed cores. When analysing the velocity structure of the Polaris Flare
we show that a universal power law connects scales from 0.03 pc to 3 pc.
However, a plateau in the Delta-variance spectrum around 5 pc indicates that
the visible large-scale velocity gradient is not converted directly into a
turbulent cascade.

four dimensions. In the probe approximation we perform a systematic analysis of
the possible supersymmetric D-brane configurations in backgrounds dual to N=1

in their generalisation to the AdS_5xL^{a,b,c} backgrounds. Some checks of the
correspondence between D-brane configurations and chiral operators of the dual
gauge theory are performed. We also analyse the possible supersymmetric
D5-brane configurations dual to defects (of codimension one and two) in N=1 SYM
theory in the framework of the Maldacena-Nunez solution. Beyond the probe
approximation, we develop techniques in order to take into account the
backreaction undergone by the type IIB supergravity solutions (dual to N=1
superconformal field theories and their extensions to cascading theories) due
to the addition of a number of flavour branes of the same order as the number
of colour branes which generate the unflavour background. The dual
interpretation of those flavour branes is given in terms of dynamical fields
transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Several
gauge theories features are matched, like beta functions, anomalies and the

a new service. The services called during the orchestration guarantee a given

monotony. In some orchestrations, however, monotony can be violated, i.e., the

service degrades. This is highly undesirable since it can render the process of
contract composition inconsistent. In this paper we define monotony for
orchestrations modelled by Colored Occurrence Nets (CO-nets) and we
characterize the classes of monotonic orchestrations. We show that few
orchestrations are indeed monotonic, mostly since latency can be traded for

understanding of galaxy formation. Despite steady improvements in the size and
quality of disk samples over the last decade, many aspects of galaxy disk
evolution remain unclear. Using two square degrees of deep, wide-field i'-band
imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, we compute size
functions for 6000 disks from z=0.2 to z=1 and explore luminosity and number
density evolution scenarios with an emphasis on the importance of selection
effects on the interpretation of the data. We also compute the size function of
a very large sample of disks from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to use as a
local (z ~ 0.1) comparison. CFHTLS size functions computed with the same fixed
luminosity-size selection window at all redshifts exhibit evolution that
appears to be best modelled by a pure number density evolution. The z = 0.3
size function is an excellent match to the z = 0.9 one if disks at the highest
redshift are a factor of 2.5 more abundant than in the local universe. The SDSS
size function would also match the z = 0.9 CFHTLS size function very well with
a similar change in number density. On the other hand, the CFHTLS size
functions computed with a varying luminosity-size selection window with
redshift remain constant if the selection window is shifted by 1.0$-$1.5 mag
towards fainter magnitudes with decreasing redshift. There is a weak dependence
on disk scale length with smaller ($h \lesssim $ 4 kpc) disks requiring more
luminosity evolution than larger ones. Given that changes in number density are
primarily due to mergers and that current estimates of merger rates below z = 1
are low, luminosity evolution appears to be a more plausible scenario to
explain the observations.

Submitted for publication in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy group catalogue of Yang et
al. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellite
galaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and
(iii) their group-centric radius. We find that the colours and concentrations
of satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.
In particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations of
satellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.
We find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes of
all masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centric
radii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. In addition, the weak
colour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass is
simply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, more
massive satellites. Combining these results with the fact that satellite
galaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than central
galaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxies
become redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo
(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). This is a clear manifestation of
environment dependence. However, there is no indication that the magnitude of
the transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxy
undergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matter
whether it becomes a satellite of a small (Milky Way sized) halo, or of a
massive cluster. We discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environment
dependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellite
galaxies.

a star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. We have spectroscopically
identified large samples of K+A galaxies both in the SDSS at z~0.1 and in the
DEEP2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in Hbeta
emission rather than the more problematic [OII] 3727. Based on measurements of
the overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that K+A galaxies
brighter than 0.4L*_B at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishable
environment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,
but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. However, at higher-z, the
environment distribution of K+A galaxies is more similar to red galaxies than
to blue galaxies. We conclude that the quenching of star formation and the
build-up of the red sequence through the K+A phase is happening in relatively
overdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.
Although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing with
time, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same along
with the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of all
galaxies has to grow with time. In addition, we do not find any significant
dependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of K+As. The existence
of a large K+A population in the field at both redshifts indicates that
cluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which these
galaxies are formed. We also demonstrates that studying K+A-environment
relations by measuring the K+A fraction in different environments is highly
non-robust. Statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions of
different populations are much better behaved.

solutions is based on the introduction of auxiliary functions in order to cast
the Einstein equations in such a way that can be explicitly integrated. Now,
despite of the equations are mathematically equivalent to the equations
obtained when the source of matter is a scalar field, is worth to mention that
the source that we consider is not a scalar field but a perfect fluid with the
stiff equation of state. The obtained solutions are expressed in terms of
simple functions of the used coordinates and two families of particular
solutions are considered. The geometrical and kinematical properties of the
solutions are then analyzed and the parameters are restricted in order to have
a physically acceptable behavior. The two particular solutions are of the
Petrov type I, the first one being regular everywhere whereas the second one
presents a big-bang singularity. Now, for a particular value of one of the
parameters, the second particular solution is a vacuum solution of the Bianchi
I type that reduces to the Kasner solution.

second, they all are {\em 3-decomposable}, that is, there is a triangle $T$
enclosing the drawing, and a balanced partition $A, B, C$ of the underlying set
of points $P$, such that the orthogonal projections of $P$ onto the sides of
$T$ show $A$ between $B$ and $C$ on one side, $B$ between $A$ and $C$ on
another side, and $C$ between $A$ and $B$ on the third side. In fact, we
conjecture that all optimal drawings are 3-decomposable, and that there are
3-symmetric optimal constructions for all $n$ multiple of 3. In this paper, we
show that any 3-decomposable geometric drawing of $K_n$ has at least

We
first address voxel-based polyhedra (polycubes), formed as the union of a

skeleton may intersect each voxel of the polyhedron, and show that the skeleton
may be constructed by a simple voxel-sweeping algorithm taking constant time
per voxel. In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight
skeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area
of the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the
polyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges
and faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight
skeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the
straight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k
is the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general
nonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a

phenomena can be studied. Recent experiments on Fermi gases have realized a
phase transition to a Fermi superfluid state with strong interparticle
interactions. This system is a realization of the BCS-BEC crossover connecting
the physics of BCS superconductivity and that of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC). While many aspects of this system have been investigated, it has not yet
been possible to measure the single-particle excitation spectrum, which is a
fundamental property directly predicted by many-body theories. Here we show
that the single-particle spectral function of the strongly interacting Fermi
gas at T ~ Tc is dramatically altered in a way that is consistent with a large
pairing gap. We use photoemission spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary
excitations and energy dispersion in the Fermi gas of atoms. In these
photoemission experiments, an rf photon ejects an atom from our strongly
interacting system via a spin-flip transition to a weakly interacting state. We
measure the occupied single-particle density of states for an ultracold Fermi
gas of 40-potassium atoms at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover and on the BEC
side of the crossover, and compare these results to that for a nearly ideal
Fermi gas. Our results probe the many-body physics in a way that could be
compared to data for high-Tc superconductors. This new measurement technique
for ultracold atom gases, like photoemission spectroscopy for electronic
materials, directly probes low energy excitations and thus can reveal
excitation gaps and/or pseudogaps. Furthermore, this technique can provide an
analog to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for probing
anisotropic systems, such as atoms in optical lattice potentials.

the thermal driving force both simplifies the calculations and provides
additional insight to why various approximate (not optimal) estimation
techniques perform as they do. To illustrate this point, we compare the
variance in the optimal estimator that we derive for thermal noise with those
of two approximate methods which, like the optimal estimator, suppress the
contribution to the variance that would come from the irrelevant, resonant
motion of the oscillator. We discuss how these methods fare when the dominant
noise process is either white displacement noise or noise with power spectral
density that is inversely proportional to the frequency ($1/f$ noise). We also
construct, in the basis of the driving force, an estimator that performs well
for a mixture of white noise and thermal noise. To find the optimal
multi-parameter estimators for thermal noise, we derive and illustrate a
generalization of traditional matrix methods for parameter estimation that can
accommodate continuous data. We discuss how this approach may help refine the
design of experiments as they allow an exact, quantitative comparison of the
precision of estimated parameters under various data acquisition and data

We consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium
(IGM) whose ionisation structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing
time of the HII region, as well as the case where the evolution is rapid. The
latter case is expected towards the end of the reionisation era where the
highest redshift luminous quasars will be observed. In the absence of
foregrounds the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM could be measured
directly from the contrast between the HII region and surrounding IGM. However,
we find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the HII
region and the IGM. This indicates that measurement of the neutral fraction
would require modelling to correct for this systematic effect. On the other
hand, foreground removal does not modify the most prominent features of the
21-cm maps. Using a simple algorithm we demonstrate that measurements of the
size and shape of observed HII regions will not be affected by continuum
foreground removal. Moreover, measurements of these quantities will not be
adversely affected by the presence of a rapidly evolving IGM.

multimodal, but the state transition pdf (STP) is narrow enough, the optimal
importance density is usually unimodal. Under this assumption, many techniques
have been proposed. But when the STP is broad, this assumption does not hold.
We study how existing techniques can be generalized to situations where the
optimal importance density is multimodal, but is unimodal conditioned on a part
of the state vector. Sufficient conditions to test for the unimodality of this
conditional posterior are derived. The number of particles, N, to accurately
track using a PF increases with state space dimension, thus making any regular
PF impractical for large dimensional tracking problems. We propose a solution
that partially addresses this problem. An important class of large dimensional
problems with multimodal OL is tracking spatially varying physical quantities
such as temperature or pressure in a large area using a network of sensors
which may be nonlinear and/or may have non-negligible failure probabilities.

It is argued that incisive insights can be obtained by considering directional
quantiles, the quantiles of projections. Directional quantile envelopes are
proposed as a way to condense this kind of information; it is demonstrated that
they are essentially halfspace (Tukey) depth levels sets, coinciding for
elliptic distributions (in particular multivariate normal) with density
contours. Relevant questions concerning their indexing, the possibility of the
reverse retrieval of directional quantile information, invariance with respect
to affine transformations, and approximation/asymptotic properties are studied.
It is argued that the analysis in terms of directional quantiles and their
envelopes offers a straightforward probabilistic interpretation and thus
conveys a concrete quantitative meaning; the directional definition can be

disc/bulge shocks and eccentric cluster orbits. We perform hundreds of FP
calculations with different initial cluster conditions, and then search a
wide-parameter space for the best-fitting initial GC MF and RD that evolves
into the observed present-day Galactic GC MF and RD. By allowing both MF and RD
of the initial GC system to vary, which is attempted for the first time in the
present Letter, we find that our best-fitting models have a higher peak mass
for a lognormal initial MF and a higher cut-off mass for a power-law initial MF
than previous estimates, but our initial total masses in GCs, M_{T,i} =
1.5-1.8x10^8 Msun, are comparable to previous results. Significant findings
include that our best-fitting lognormal MF shifts downward by 0.35 dex during
the period of 13 Gyr, and that our power-law initial MF models well-fit the
observed MF and RD only when the initial MF is truncated at >~10^5 Msun. We
also find that our results are insensitive to the initial distribution of orbit
eccentricity and inclination, but are rather sensitive to the initial
concentration of the clusters and to how the initial tidal radius is defined.
If the clusters are assumed to be formed at the apocentre while filling the
tidal radius there, M_{T,i} can be as high as 6.9x10^8 Msun, which amounts to
~75 per cent of the current mass in the stellar halo.

further (apparent) pulsar magnetic field decay during accretion, while they
conversely suggest the need for a re-evaluation of the assumed \textit{typical}

photometric systems, the dependence of reddening on the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and the nonlinearity of reddening are likewise
non-negligible for the SDSS system if extinction is significant (~> 1 mag).
These behaviors are most significant for the g filter, which has the largest
bandwidth-to-central wavelength ratio among SDSS filters. The SDSS colors
involving adjacent filters show greater SED-dependence and nonlinearity. A
procedure for calculating the correct amount of extinction from an observed
color excess is provided. The relative extinctions between (i.e., the
extinction law for) SDSS filters given by Schlegel et al., which were
calculated with an older version of filter response functions, would
underestimate the amount of extinction in most cases by ~5 to 10 % (maximum ~20
%). We recommend A/A_{5500} values of 1.574, 1.191, 0.876, 0.671 & 0.486 for

for the SDSS galaxies with a small extinction (i.e., for cases where the
nonlinearity and SED-dependence of the reddening is not important). The

from entropy considerations that a finite size horizon must develop even in an

corrections to supergravity. It can then be shown that the Hagedorn like

offered by the medium and driven by symmetric periodic forces. In the adiabatic
limit the calculations are done by extending the matrix continued fraction
method and also by numerically solving the appropriate Langevin equation. For
finite frequency field drive the ratchet effect is obtained only numerically.
In the transient time scales the system shows dispersionless behaviour as
reported earlier when a constant force is applied. In the periodic drive case
the dispersion behaviour is more complex. In this brief communication we report

ring contribution to QED effective potential at finite temperature and non-zero
magnetic field is determined beyond the static limit, $(k_{0}\to

weak and strong magnetic field limit. In the limit of weak magnetic field, at
high temperature and for $\alpha\to 0$, the improved ring potential consists of
a term proportional to $T^{4}\alpha^{5/2}$, in addition to the expected
$T^{4}\alpha^{3/2}$ term arising from the static limit. Here, $\alpha$ is the
fine structure constant. In the limit of strong magnetic field, where QED
dynamics is dominated by the lowest Landau level (LLL), the ring potential
includes a novel term consisting of dilogarithmic function
$(eB){Li}_{2}(-\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\frac{eB}{m^{2}})$. Using the ring improved
(one-loop) effective potential including the one-loop effective potential and
ring potential in the IR limit, the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of QED
is studied at finite temperature and in the presence of strong magnetic field.
The gap equation, the dynamical mass and the critical temperature of QED in the
regime of LLL dominance are determined in the improved IR as well as in the
static limit. For a given value of magnetic field, the improved ring potential
is shown to be more efficient in decreasing the critical temperature arising
from one-loop effective potential.

directions passes through and around the cloak as though the object were not
present. A theory of acoustic cloaking is developed using the transformation or
change-of-variables method for mapping the cloaked region to a point with
vanishing scattering strength. We show that the acoustical parameters in the
cloak must be anisotropic: either the mass density or the mechanical stiffness
or both. If the stiffness is isotropic, corresponding to a fluid with a single
bulk modulus, then the inertial density must be infinite at the inner surface
of the cloak. This requires an infinitely massive cloak. We show that perfect
cloaking can be achieved with finite mass through the use of anisotropic
stiffness. The generic class of anisotropic material required is known as a
pentamode material. If the transformation deformation gradient is symmetric
then the pentamode material parameters are explicit, otherwise its properties
depend on a stress like tensor which satisfies a static equilibrium equation.
For a given transformation mapping the material composition of the cloak is not
uniquely defined, but the phase and wave speeds of the pseudo-acoustic waves in
the cloak are unique. Examples are given from 2D and 3D.

the motion of individual grains in a granular bed driven by a laminar fluid to
give us new insights into the relationship between hydrodynamic stress and
surface granular flow. A closed cell of rectangular cross-section is partially
filled with glass beads and a constant fluid flux $Q$ flows through the cell.
The refractive indices of the fluid and the glass beads are matched and the
cell is illuminated with a laser sheet, allowing us to image individual beads.
The bed erodes to a rest height $h_r$ which depends on $Q$. The Shields
threshold criterion assumes that the non-dimensional ratio $\theta$ of the
viscous stress on the bed to the hydrostatic pressure difference across a grain
is sufficient to predict the granular flux. Furthermore, the Shields criterion
states that the granular flux is non-zero only for $\theta >\theta_c$. We find
that the Shields criterion describes the observed relationship $h_r \propto
Q^{1/2}$ when the bed height is offset by approximately half a grain diameter.
Introducing this offset in the estimation of $\theta$ yields a collapse of the
measured Einstein number $q^*$ to a power-law function of $\theta - \theta_c$
with exponent $1.75 \pm 0.25$. The dynamics of the bed height relaxation are
well described by the power law relationship between the granular flux and the

orbit of Moon and the subsequent lengthening of the Mean Solar Day. The author
redid the same analysis based on the fact that Moon was receding at the rate of
3.8 cm per annum. Basic Mechanics of Earth-Moon is worked out and various
system parameters are optimized to fit the given boundary condition obtained by
Apollo Mission and other modern means of observations. Based on this
theoretical formulation the theoretical graph of the lengthening of the Mean
Solar Day with respect to time is drawn and is compared with the observational
graph of the same based on pale ontological data, paleo tidal data and
iron-banded formation. The observational data on Mean Solar Day is found to
follow the theoretical smooth curve in post-Cambrian Era but is found to
deviate in the remote past. This deviation is corrected by taking the evolving
form of Moment of Inertia of Earth. The deviation of the observed data prompts
the Author to suggest that the lengthening of the Mean Solar Day curve could
possibly be used as an analytical seismograph for the impending earthquakes and
sudden volcanic eruptions. The Basic Mechanics of E-M system is generalized to
lay the foundation of simulation software for any Planet-Satellite pair in our
Solar System.

  correlation with the Mt. Wilson classification and flaring activity","Accepted for publication in Solar Physics",,"10.1007/s11207-008-9233-5",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two different multi-resolution analyses are used to decompose the structure
of active region magnetic flux into concentrations of different size scales.
Lines separating these opposite polarity regions of flux at each size scale are
found. These lines are used as a mask on a map of the magnetic field gradient
to sample the local gradient between opposite polarity regions of given scale
sizes. It is shown that the maximum, average and standard deviation of the
magnetic flux gradient for alpha, beta, beta-gamma and beta-gamma-delta active
regions increase in the order listed, and that the order is maintained over all
length-scales. This study demonstrates that, on average, the Mt. Wilson
classification encodes the notion of activity over all length-scales in the
active region, and not just those length-scales at which the strongest flux
gradients are found. Further, it is also shown that the average gradients in
the field, and the average length-scale at which they occur, also increase in
the same order. Finally, there are significant differences in the gradient
distribution, between flaring and non-flaring active regions, which are
maintained over all length-scales. It is also shown that the average gradient
content of active regions that have large flares (GOES class 'M' and above) is
larger than that for active regions containing flares of all flare sizes; this
difference is also maintained at all length-scales.

paper, we propose a resonant speed meter, as a displacement noise-canceled

remarkable feature of this interferometer is that, at certain frequencies,
gravitational-wave signals are amplified, while displacement noises are not.

Bose-Einstein condensates are sent into interferometers, they nevertheless
acquire a relative phase under the effect of quantum measurements. The usual
explanation relies on spontaneous symmetry breaking, where phases are ascribed
to all condensates and treated as unknown classical quantities. However, this
image is not always sufficient: when all particles are measured, quantum
mechanics predicts probabilities that are sometimes in contradiction with it,
as illustrated by quantum violations of local realism. In this letter, we show
that interferometers can be used to demonstrate a large variety of violations
with an arbitrarily large number of particles. With two independent
condensates, we find violations of the BCHSH inequalities, as well as new
N-body Hardy impossibilities. With three condensates, we obtain new GHZ
(Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger) type contradictions.

The case when F grows fast is well known, and under suitable conditions one can
show that there exists a family of exponentially small eigenvalues, related to
the wells of F . We show that, for an F with a slow growth, the spectrum is R+,
but we can find a family of resonances whose real parts behave as the
