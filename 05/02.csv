in the cosmic microwave background radiation from multiple sky maps that also
contain both instrument noise and foreground contaminants. The prescription is
well-suited for cosmological parameter estimation and accounts for
uncertainties in the cosmic microwave background extraction scheme. The
technique is computationally viable at low resolution and may be considered a
natural and significant generalization of the ""Internal Linear Combination""
approach to foreground removal. An important potential application is the
analysis of the multi-frequency temperature and polarization data from the
forthcoming Planck satellite.

interferer (WTC-HI) is considered in which a transmitter sends confidential
messages to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and
with the help of an interferer. The interferer, which does not know the
confidential message assists the confidential message transmission by sending a
signal that is independent of the transmitted message. An achievable secrecy
rate and a Sato-type upper bound on the secrecy capacity are given for the
Gaussian WTC-HI. Through numerical analysis, it is found that the upper bound
is close to the achievable secrecy rate when the interference is weak for
symmetric interference channels, and under more general conditions for
asymmetric Gaussian interference channels.

demonstrated that such a model is recoverable from their WKB-type analysis of

independence of solutions of these equations is controlled by determinants
whose form (up to a constant) coincides with the Veneziano (or Veneziano-like)
amplitudes.In the simplest case, when the K-Z equations are reducible to the
Gauss hypergeometric equation, the determinantal conditions coincide with those
which were discovered by Kummer in 19th century. Kummer's results admit
physical interpretation crucial for providing needed justification associating

isolated single stars and relatively more often in magnetic cataclysmic
variables. Some 1,253 white dwarfs with a detached low-mass main-sequence
companion are identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey but none of these is
observed to show evidence for Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines associated
with a magnetic field in excess of 1MG. If such high magnetic fields on white
dwarfs result from the isolated evolution of a single star then there should be
the same fraction of high field white dwarfs among this SDSS binary sample as
among single stars. Thus we deduce that the origin of such high magnetic fields
must be intimately tied to the formation of cataclysmic variables. CVs emerge
from common envelope evolution as very close but detached binary stars that are
then brought together by magnetic braking or gravitational radiation. We
propose that the smaller the orbital separation at the end of the common
envelope phase, the stronger the magnetic field. The magnetic cataclysmic
variables originate from those common envelope systems that almost merge. We
propose further that those common envelope systems that do merge are the
progenitors of the single high field white dwarfs. Thus all highly magnetic
white dwarfs, be they single stars or the components of MCVs, have a binary
origin. This hypothesis also accounts for the relative dearth of single white
dwarfs with fields of 10,000 - 1,000,000G. Such intermediate-field white dwarfs
are found preferentially in cataclysmic variables. In addition the bias towards
higher masses for highly magnetic white dwarfs is expected if a fraction of
these form when two degenerate cores merge in a common envelope. Similar
scenarios may account for very high field neutron stars.

analyzing the power spectrum: we detect at greater than 5 sigma a decrease in
the acoustic scale in the real-space matter power spectrum of 0.2% at z=1.5,
growing to 0.45% at z=0.3. In redshift space, the shifts are about 25% larger:
we detect a decrease of 0.25% of at z=1.5 and 0.54% at z=0.3. Despite the
nonzero amounts, these shifts are highly predictable numerically, and hence
removable within the standard ruler analysis of clustering data. Moreover, we
show that a simple density-field reconstruction method substantially reduces

are reduced to less than 0.1% at z=0.3-1.5, even in the presence of
non-negligible shot noise. Finally, we show that the ratio of the cosmological

dependance is nearly linear in a wide interval of the intensities of noise. It
is found out that for weak noise the Lyapunov exponents do not depend

largest Lyapunov exponent decreases and even becomes negative indicating the

power-law behaviour, are derived and characterized. The R\'enyi entropy of the
optimum distributions can be viewed as a function of the constraint. This
defines two families of entropy functionals in the space of possible expected
values. General properties of these functionals, including nonnegativity,
minimum, convexity, are documented. Their relationships as well as numerical
aspects are also discussed. Finally, we work out some specific cases for the
reference measure $Q(x)$ and recover in a limit case some well-known entropies.

statement of results (as probabilities) and an explanation of these results (in
terms of linear operators). The inverse problem of choosing an explanation to
fit given results is analyzed, leading to the conclusion that any quantum
description comes as an element of a family of related descriptions, entailing
multiple statements of results and multiple explanations. Facing this
multiplicity opens avenues for exploration and consequences that are only
beginning to be explored. Among the consequences are these: (1) statements of
results impose topologies on control parameters, without resort to any quantum
explanation; (2) an endless source of distinct explanations forces an open
cycle of exploration and description bringing more and more control parameters
into play, and (3) ambiguity of description is essential to the concept of
invariance in physics.

into account that stars are not point-like but extended. We show that the
finite size of stars can dramatically change the self-lensing eventrate and
(less dramatically) also the halo lensing eventrate, if events are as bright as
WeCAPP-GL1. The brightness of the brightest events mostly depends on the source
sizes and fluxes and on the distance distribution of sources and lenses and
therefore can be used as a sensitive discriminator between halo-lensing and
self-lensing events, provided the stellar population mix of source stars is
known well enough. Using a realistic model for the 3D-light distribution,
stellar population and extinction of M31, we show that an event like WeCAPP-GL1
is very unlikely to be caused by self-lensing. In the entire WeCAPP-field
($17.2'\times 17.2'$ centered on the bulge) we expect only one self-lensing
event every 49 years with the approximate parameters of WeCAPP-GL1 (time-scale
1-3d, $R$ flux-excess <19.0 mag). If we assume only 20% of the dark halos of
M31 and the Milky-Way consist of 1 solar mass MACHOs an event like WeCAPP-GL1
would occur every 10 years. Further more, if one uses position, FWHM time
scale, flux excess and color of WeCAPP-GL1, self-lensing is even 13 times less
likely than lensing by a MACHO, if MACHOs contribute 20% to the total halo mass
and have masses in the range of 0.1 to 4 solar masses. We also demonstrate that
(i) the brightness distribution of events in general is a good discriminator
between self and halo lensing (ii) the time-scale distribution is a good
discriminator if the MACHO mass is larger than 0.5 solar masses. Future surveys
of M31 like PAndromeda (Pan-STARRS 1) should be able to provide many more such
events within the next 4 years.

the engine is an accreting compact object, and for a standard conversion factor
between accretion rate and jet luminosity, the switch between a neutrino-cooled
thin disk and a non-cooled thick disk takes place at the transition from the
prompt to the flaring phase. We discuss the implications of this coincidence
under different scenarios for the powering of the GRB outflow. We also show
that the interaction of the outflow with the envelope of the progenitor star
cannot produce flares out of a continuous relativistic flow, and conclude that
it is the dynamics of the disk or the jet-launching mechanism that generates an
intrinsically unsteady outflow on timescales much longer than the dynamical
timescale of the system. This is consistent with the fact that X-ray flares are
observed in short-duration GRBs as well as in long-duration ones.

power-series expansion used in the evaluation of the self force becomes invalid
during transition time intervals immediately following the application and
termination of an otherwise analytic externally applied force, transition
forces must be included during these transition time intervals to remove the

fairly complete physical picture for this remarkable burst. The data indicate
that the prompt optical and gamma-ray photons were produced at the same
location but by different radiation processes: synchrotron and synchrotron
self-Compton, respectively. The burst emission was produced at a distance of
10^{16.5} cm from the center of explosion by an ultra-relativistic source
moving at Lorentz factor of ~500. A straightforward inference is that about 10
times more energy must have been radiated at tens of GeV than that released at
~1 MeV. Assuming that the GRB outflow was baryonic and that the gamma-ray
source was shock-heated plasma, the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of the

afterglow optical emission (up to 1 ks) is too fast to be attributed to the
reverse shock crossing the GRB ejecta but is consistent with the expectations
for the ""large-angle emission"" released during the burst. The pure power-law
decay of the optical afterglow flux from 1 ks to 10 day is most naturally

recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless,
bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given

selector and $\ell_1$ minimization with an $\ell_2$ constraint. The results of
this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the

The distribution of EM sin |b| for the full sample is poorly characterized by a
single normal distribution, but is extraordinarily well fit by a lognormal
distribution, with <log EM sin |b|> = 0.146 +/- 0.001 and standard deviation
0.190 +/- 0.001. <log EM sin |b|> drops from 0.260 +/- 0.002 at Galactic

distribution may widen slightly at low Galactic latitude. We compare the

microscopic nonequilibrium to macroscopic scales, resulting in anomalous power
spectra for the cosmic microwave background. The conclusions depend only weakly

find temperatures kT around 0.18 keV for the three known remnants and 0.69 keV
for the candidate. The low temperature, low surface brightness, and large
extent of the three remnants indicates relatively large ages. The emission from
the new candidate (HFPK 334) is more centrally peaked and the higher
temperature suggests a younger remnant. Our new radio images indicate that a
pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) is possibly associated with this object. The SNRs
known in the SMC show a variety of morphological structures that are relatively

second-order cosmological perturbations during the pre-recombination era. The
key process for this is Thomson scattering between the photons and the charged
particles within the cosmic plasma. To tame the multi-component interacting
fluid system, we employ the tight coupling approximation. It is shown that the
source term for the magnetic field is given by the vorticity, which signals the
intrinsically second-order quantities, and the product of the first order
perturbations. The vorticity itself is sourced by the product of the
first-order quantities in the vorticity evolution equation. The magnetic fields
generated by this process are estimated to be $\sim 10^{-29} $Gauss on the
horizon scale at the recombination epoch. Although our rough estimate suggests
that the current generation mechanism can work even on smaller scales, more
careful investigation is needed to make clear whether it indeed works in a wide
range of spatial scales.

approximation of granular fabric is presented in terms of branch vectors

perpendicular to the branch vectors. It is found that the origin of enhanced

with respect to the sphere packing which has a higher fabric anisotropy.
Various contact types (face-vertex, face-face, etc) contribute differently to
force transmission and fabric anisotropy. In particular, most face-face
contacts belong to strong force chains along the major principal stress
direction whereas vertex-face contacts are correlated with weak forces and
oriented on average along the minor principal stress direction in steady
shearing.

interatomic magnetic interactions in centrosymmetric monoclinic structures of

an effective lattice fermion model for the manganese 3d bands and derive
parameters of this model entirely from first-principles electronic structure
calculations. Then, we solve this model in terms of the mean-field Hartree-Fock
method and derive parameters of interatomic magnetic interactions between Mn
ions. We argue that although nearest-neighbor interactions favors the
ferromagnetism, they compete with longer-range antiferromagnetic (AFM)
interactions, the existence of which is directly related with the peculiar
geometry of the orbital ordering pattern realized in BiMnO$_3$ below 474 K.
These AFM interactions favor an AFM phase, which breaks the inversion symmetry.
The formation of the AFM phase is assisted by the orbital degrees of freedom,
which tend to adjust the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions in the
direction, which further stabilizes this phase. We propose that the
multiferroelectric behavior, observed in BiMnO$_3$, may be related with the
emergence of the AFM phase under certain conditions.

frequency), it is possible to have the same wavefunction on the other

matter-wave solitons, as well as vortices and vortex lattices in
two-dimensional condensates. The efficiency of the proposed switch is shown to
be 100% when inter-species and intra-species interaction strengths are equal.
The deviations from equal interaction strengths are analyzed within a two-mode

and REM on November 7, 2006, when the source was in a low X-ray state. We
perform a comparative analysis of these results with those obtained from
previous observations in different brightness states. RESULTS: We found that
the peak of the synchrotron emission moved from ultraviolet to optical
wavelengths and the X-ray spectrum is best fit with a broken power law model
with Gamma_2 ~ 2.4 harder than Gamma_1 ~ 2.6 and a break at about 3.5 keV. This
suggests that the soft X-rays (E < 3.5 keV) are related to the high-energy tail
of the synchrotron emission, while the hard X-rays (E > 3.5 keV) are from the
energy region between the synchrotron and inverse-Compton humps. The different
variability at energies below and above the break strengthens this hypothesis.
Our results also stress the importance of monitoring this source at both low
and high energies to better characterize its variability behaviour.

the Hilbert scheme of points on C^2. We provide diagrammatic rules for

the framework of {\em mixed asymptotics}. In this new framework, statistics are
estimated over a sample which size increases as the resolution scale (or the
sampling period) becomes finer. This allows one to continuously interpolate
between the situation where one studies a single cascade sample at arbitrary
fine scales and where at fixed scale, the sample length (number of cascades
realizations) becomes infinite. We show that scaling exponents of ''mixed''
partitions functions i.e., the estimator of the cumulant generating function of
the cascade generator distribution, depends on some ``mixed asymptotic''
exponent $\chi$ respectively above and beyond two critical value $p_\chi^-$ and
$p_\chi^+$. We study the convergence properties of partition functions in mixed
asymtotics regime and establish a central limit theorem. These results are
shown to remain valid within a general wavelet analysis framework. Their
interpretation in terms of Besov frontier are discussed. Moreover, within the
mixed asymptotic framework, we establish a ``box-counting'' multifractal
formalism that can be seen as a rigorous formulation of Mandelbrot's negative

tessellation is defined according to the lens mapping of a regular grid onto
the source plane. The Bayesian penalty function allows us to recover the best
non-linear potential-model parameters and/or a grid-based potential correction
and to objectively quantify the level of regularization for both the source and
the potential. In addition, we implement a Nested-Sampling technique to
quantify the errors on all non-linear mass model parameters -- ... -- and allow
an objective ranking of different potential models in terms of the marginalized
evidence. In particular, we are interested in comparing very smooth lens mass
models with ones that contain mass-substructures. The algorithm has been tested
on a range of simulated data sets, created from a model of a realistic lens
system. One of the lens systems is characterized by a smooth potential with a
power-law density profile, twelve include a NFW dark-matter substructure of
different masses and at different positions and one contains two NFW dark
substructures with the same mass but with different positions. Reconstruction
of the source and of the lens potential for all of these systems shows the

representations for the matter field and the inertial variables. The quantum
constraints are solved via group averaging techniques and, analogous to the
case of spatial geometry in LQG, the smooth (flat) spacetime geometry is
replaced by a discrete quantum structure. An overcomplete set of Dirac

conformal isometries, are represented as operators on the physical Hilbert

Fock quantization, the non- Fock nature of the representation ensures that the

to, at most, a countable subset of the (uncountably large) set of observables
of type (a). The model thus offers a fertile testing ground for proposed
definitions of quantum dynamics as well as semiclassical states in LQG.

from the measurements of Lick indices. High-precision estimates of stellar
population properties have been obtained for a large sample of faint galaxies

populations and internal kinematics to the low-velocity dispersion regime. We
have revealed a peculiar population of elliptical galaxies in the core of the

fainter. External mechanisms of gas removal (ram pressure stripping and
gravitational harassment) are more likely to have occurred than internal

only low energy defibrillation approach to have gained clinical significance,
but it is still suboptimal. Low energy defibrillation would avoid adverse side
effects associated with high voltage shocks and allow the application of ICD
therapy where it is not tolerated today. We present results of computer
simulations of a bidomain model of cardiac tissue with human atrial ionic
kinetics. Re-entry was initiated and low energy shocks were applied with the
same period as the re-entry, using feedback to maintain resonance. We
demonstrate that such stimulation can move the core of re-entrant patterns, in
the direction depending on location of electrodes and a time delay in the
feedback. Termination of re-entry is achieved with shock strength one order of
magnitude weaker than in conventional single-shock defibrillation. We conclude
that resonant drift pacing can terminate re-entry at a fraction of the shock
strength currently used for defibrillation and can potentially work where
antitachycardia pacing fails, due to the feedback mechanisms. Success depends
on a number of details which these numerical simulations have uncovered.

shown to be proportional to the ratio of the cross sections for the elastic
scattering of an unpolarized electron on a partially polarized proton with and
without proton spin flip. The initial proton at rest should be polarized along
the direction of the motion of the final proton. Similar results are valid for
both radiative $ep$ scattering and the photoproduction of pairs on a proton in
the Bethe--Heitler kinematics. When the initial proton is fully polarized in
the direction of the motion of the final proton, the cross section for the $ep
\to ep$ process, as well as for the $ep \to ep \gamma$ and $\gamma p \to e \bar
e p$ processes, without (with) proton spin flip is expressed only in terms of
the square of the electric (magnetic) proton form factor. Such an experiment on
the measurement of the cross sections without and with proton spin flip would
make it possible to acquire new independent data on the behavior of
$G_E^2(Q^2)$ and $G_M^2(Q^2)$, which are necessary for resolving the
contradictions appearing after the experiment of the JLab collaboration on the
measurement of the proton form factors with the method of polarization transfer
from the initial electron to the final proton.

square root of a real matrix. It is known that for every real n x n matrix, A,
if no real eigenvalue of A is negative or zero, then A has a real logarithm,
that is, there is a real matrix, X, such that e^X = A. Furthermore, if the
eigenvalues, xi, of X satisfy the property -pi < Im(xi) < pi, then X is unique.
It is also known that under the same condition every real n x n matrix, A, has
a real square root, that is, there is a real matrix, X, such that X^2 = A.
Moreover, if the eigenvalues, rho e^{i theta}, of X satisfy the condition -pi/2
< theta < pi/2, then X is unique. These theorems are the theoretical basis for
various numerical methods for exponentiating a matrix or for computing its
logarithm using a method known as scaling and squaring (resp. inverse scaling
and squaring). Such methods play an important role in the log-Euclidean
framework due to Arsigny, Fillard, Pennec and Ayache and its applications to
medical imaging. Actually, there is a necessary and sufficient condition for a
real matrix to have a real logarithm (or a real square root) but it is fairly
subtle as it involves the parity of the number of Jordan blocks associated with
negative eigenvalues. As far as I know, with the exception of Higham's recent
book, proofs of these results are scattered in the literature and it is not
easy to locate them. Moreover, Higham's excellent book assumes a certain level
of background in linear algebra that readers interested in the topics of this
paper may not possess so we feel that a more elementary presentation might be a
valuable supplement to Higham. In these notes, I present a unified exposition
of these results and give more direct proofs of some of them using the Real
Jordan Form.
