universe: it provides a direct way to map the distribution of dark matter
around galaxies, clusters of galaxies and on cosmological scales. Furthermore,
the measurement of lensing induced distortions of the shapes of distant
galaxies is a powerful probe of dark energy. In this review we describe how
lensing measurements are made and interpreted. We discuss various systematic
effects that can hamper progress and how they may be overcome. We review some
of the recent results in weak lensing by galaxies, galaxy clusters and cosmic

Soc. 23 (2010), no. 4, 909-966",,,"math.AG math.AT math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the interaction between geometric operations on stacks and algebraic
operations on their categories of sheaves. We work in the general setting of
derived algebraic geometry: our basic objects are derived stacks X and their
oo-categories QC(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. We show that for a broad class of
derived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on
their categories of sheaves are compatible. We identify the category of sheaves
on a fiber product with the tensor product of the categories of sheaves on the
factors. We also identify the category of sheaves on a fiber product with
functors between the categories of sheaves on the factors (thus realizing
functors as integral transforms, generalizing a theorem of Toen for ordinary
schemes). As a first application, for a perfect stack X, consider QC(X) with
its usual monoidal tensor product. Then our main results imply the equivalence
of the Drinfeld center (or Hochschild cohomology category) of QC(X), the trace
(or Hochschild homology category) of QC(X) and the category of sheaves on the
loop space of X. More generally, we show that the E_n-center and the E_n-trace
(or E_n-Hochschild cohomology and homology categories respectively) of QC(X)
are equivalent to the category of sheaves on the space of maps from the
n-sphere into X. This directly verifies geometric instances of the categorified
Deligne and Kontsevich conjectures on the structure of Hochschild cohomology.
As a second application, we use our main results to calculate the Drinfeld
center of categories of linear endofunctors of categories of sheaves. This
provides concrete applications to the structure of Hecke algebras in geometric
representation theory. Finally, we explain how all of the above results can be
interpreted in the context of topological field theory.

regions of galaxies are known as sigma-drops. Knowing the origin of these
features can lead to better understanding of inner galactic dynamics.
  Aims: We present a sample of 20 sigma-drop galaxies matched with a control
sample of galaxies without sigma-drop in order to search for correlations
between sigma-drops and the properties, primarily morphological, of the nuclear
zones and discs of their host galaxies.
  Methods: We study the dust and Halpha distribution at 0.1 arcsec scale, using
Hubble Space Telescope imaging, in the circumnuclear zones of the two samples
of galaxies, searching for differences and trying to establish a link between
the nuclear kinematics and the host morphology. We have also considered the CO
and HI emission of the galaxies and their luminosity profiles.
  Results: We classify the two samples following both morphological parameters
and the luminosity profiles. We find a larger fraction of nuclear dust spirals
and Halpha rings in the sigma-drop sample. We also find that the fraction of
Seyfert galaxies in the sigma-drop sample is bigger than that of LINERs and
that the reverse is true for the control sample.
  Conclusions: Our findings are evidence that a $\sigma$-drop is very probably
due to inflow-induced star formation in a dynamically cool disc, or in a gas
ring, shock focused by an inner Lindblad resonance above a certain critical
density level. The same mechanism that feeds the nuclear ring or the nuclear
disc is probably reponsible for the higher rate of Seyfert galaxies among the
$\sigma$-drop hosts.

down to a spatial scale of 100 pc the radio continuum emission is correlated

each parent 2D quantum liquid would be a precise pattern of 1D gapless modes on

the 2D phases from controlled numerical and analytical studies in quasi-1D. As
a first step we explore itinerant boson models with a frustrating ring exchange

proposed two-dimensional d-wave correlated Bose liquid (DBL) phase. A
combination of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group,
variational Monte Carlo, and bosonization analysis of a quasi-1D gauge theory,
all provide compelling evidence for the existence of a new strong-coupling
phase of bosons on the 2-leg ladder which can be understood as a descendant of
the two-dimensional DBL. We suggest several generalizations to quantum spin and

comparable contributions of AGN and starbursts. The optical line diagnostics
support the presence of AGN in the bulk of the weak-PAH sources. With one
exception, our sources are narrow-line sources, show no obvious correspondence
between the optical extinction and the silicate feature depth, and, in two
cases, show evidence for outflows. Radio AGN are present in both strong-PAH and
weak-PAH sources. This is supported by our sample's far-IR-to-radio ratios (q)
being consistently below the average value of 2.34 for local star-forming
galaxies. We use survival analysis to include the lower-limits given by the
radio-undetected sources, arriving at <q>=2.07+/-0.01 for our z>1.5 sample. In
total, radio and, where available, optical line diagnostics support the
presence of AGN in 57% of the z>1.5 sources, independent of IR-based
diagnostics. For higher-z sources, the AGN luminosities alone are estimated to

Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) separability probabilities for two-qubit and qubit-qutrit
(real, complex and quaternionic) systems. An important theoretical concept
employed has been that of a separability function. It appears that if one could
analogously obtain separability functions parameterized by the eigenvalues of
the density matrices in question--rather than the diagonal entries, as
originally used--comparable progress could be achieved in obtaining
separability probabilities based on the broad, interesting class of monotone
metrics (the Bures, being its most prominent [minimal] member). Though
large-scale numerical estimations of such eigenvalue-parameterized functions
have been undertaken, it seems desirable also to study them in
lower-dimensional specialized scenarios in which they can be exactly obtained.
In this regard, we employ an Euler-angle parameterization of SO(4) derived by
S. Cacciatori (reported in an Appendix)--in the manner of the SU(4)-density
matrix parameterization of Tilma, Byrd and Sudarshan. We are, thus, able to
find simple exact separability (inverse-sine-like) functions for two real
two-qubit (rebit) systems, both having three free eigenvalues and one free
Euler angle. We also employ the important Verstraete-Audenaert-de Moor bound to
obtain exact HS probabilities that a generic two-qubit state is absolutely
separable (that is, can not be entangled by unitary transformations). In this
regard, we make copious use of trigonometric identities involving the
tetrahedral dihedral angle arccos(1/3).

contaminated by foreground emission. The goal of this paper is to compare
proposed methods for separating CMB from foregrounds based on their different
spectral and spatial characteristics, and to separate the foregrounds into
components of different physical origin. A component separation challenge has
been organized, based on a set of realistically complex simulations of sky
emission. Several methods including those based on internal template
subtraction, maximum entropy method, parametric method, spatial and harmonic
cross correlation methods, and independent component analysis have been tested.
Different methods proved to be effective in cleaning the CMB maps from
foreground contamination, in reconstructing maps of diffuse Galactic emissions,
and in detecting point sources and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signals. The power
spectrum of the residuals is, on the largest scales, four orders of magnitude
lower than that of the input Galaxy power spectrum at the foreground minimum.
The CMB power spectrum was accurately recovered up to the sixth acoustic peak.
The point source detection limit reaches 100 mJy, and about 2300 clusters are
detected via the thermal SZ effect on two thirds of the sky. We have found that
no single method performs best for all scientific objectives. We foresee that
the final component separation pipeline for Planck will involve a combination
of methods and iterations between processing steps targeted at different
objectives such as diffuse component separation, spectral estimation and
compact source extraction.

extensive numerical simulations. For a wide range of parameters the flat

by the usual parameter f_NL. We find that the imprints of primordial
non-Gaussianity are well preserved in the negative tail of the probability
function during the evolution of the density perturbation. The effect is
already noticeable at redshifts as large as 4 and can be detected out to the
present epoch. At z=0 we find that the fraction of the volume occupied by
regions with underdensity delta < -0.9, typical of voids, is about 1.3 per cent
in the Gaussian case and increases to ~2.2 per cent if f_NL=-1000 while
decreases to ~0.5 per cent if f_NL=+1000. This result suggests that void-based
statistics may provide a powerful method to detect non-Gaussianity even at low
redshifts which is complementary to the measurements of the higher-order
moments of the probability distribution function like the skewness or the
kurtosis for which deviations from the Gaussian case are detected at the 25-50

to determine the conditions under which collapse is significantly disrupted.
Motivated by observations of star forming regions which exhibit flattened cloud
structures, this study considers collapsing protoclusters with disk geometries.
The collapse of a 10^3 Msun protocluster initially a distance of 2-10 pc from a
10^3 - 10^6 Msun point mass is numerically calculated. Simulations with zero
initial relative velocity between the two are completed as well as simulations
with relative velocities consistent with those observed in GMCs. The results
allow us to define the conditions under which it is safe to assume protocluster
collapse proceeds as if in isolation. For instance, we find the collapse of a
10^3 Msun protocluster will be significantly disrupted if it is within 2-4 pc
of a 10^4 Msun point mass. Thus, the collapse of a 10^3 Msun protocluster can
be considered to proceed as if in isolation if it is more than ~ 4 pc away from
a 10^4 Msun compact object. In addition, in no portion of the sampled parameter
space does the gravitational interaction between the protocluster disk and the
massive particle significantly disperse the disk into the background GMC. We
discuss the distribution of clusters of young stellar objects within the
Perseus and Mon R2 star forming regions, which are consistent with the results
of our simulations and the limitations of our results in gas dominated regions
such as the Orion cloud.

car-following models which describe continuous feedback control tasks
(acceleration and braking) and models for discrete-choice tasks as a response
to the surrounding traffic. The driving style of an agent is characterized by
model parameters such as reaction time, desired speed, desired time gap,
anticipation etc. In addition, internal state variables corresponding to the
agent's ""mind"" are used to incorporate the driving experiences. We introduce a
time-dependency of some parameters to describe the frustration of drivers being
in a traffic jam for a while. Furthermore, the driver's behavior is externally
influenced by the neighboring vehicles and also by environmental input such as
limited motorization and braking power, visibility conditions and road traffic
regulations. A general approach for dealing with discrete decision problems in
the context of vehicular traffic is introduced and applied to mandatory and
discretionary lane changes. Furthermore, we consider the decision process
whether to brake or not when approaching a traffic light turning from green to
amber. Another aspect of vehicular traffic is related to the heterogeneity of
drivers. We discuss a hybrid system of coupled vehicle and information flow

equal to zero by means of a gauge transformation that preserves the Lorenz

equation governing the field may be neglected only if it diminishes with
distance faster than the contribution of the source density in the far zone. In
the case of a source whose distribution pattern rotates superluminally (i.e.,

substructure mass fraction and a characteristic mass of subhalos (namely
<m^2>/<m>). Time delay perturbations therefore complement gravitational lens
flux ratio anomalies and astrometric perturbations by measuring a different
moment of the subhalo mass function. Unlike flux ratio anomalies, ""time delay
millilensing"" is unaffected by dust extinction or stellar microlensing in the
lens galaxy. Furthermore, we show that time delay ratios are immune to the
radial profile degeneracy that usually plagues lens modeling. We lay out a
mathematical theory of time delay perturbations and find it to be tractable and
attractive. We predict that in ""cusp"" lenses with close triplets of images,
substructure may change the arrival-time order of the images (compared with
smooth models). We discuss the possibility that this effect has already been

distinguish between the central galaxy in a halo and all the others
(satellites). To include colors, we provide a prescription for how the
color-magnitude relation of centrals and satellites depends on halo mass. This
follows from two assumptions: (i) the bimodality of the color distribution at
fixed luminosity is independent of halo mass, and (ii) the fraction of
satellite galaxies which populate the red sequence increases with luminosity.
We show that these two assumptions allow one to build a model of how galaxy
clustering depends on color without any additional free parameters than those
required to model the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering. We then show
that the resulting model is in good agreement with the distribution and
clustering of colors in the SDSS, both by comparing the predicted correlation
functions of red and blue galaxies with measurements, and by comparing the
predicted color mark correlation function with the measured one. Mark
correlation functions are powerful tools for identifying and quantifying
correlations between galaxy properties and their environments: our results
indicate that the correlation between halo mass and environment is the primary
driver for correlations between galaxy colors and the environment; additional
correlations associated with halo `assembly bias' are relatively small. Our
approach shows explicitly how to construct mock catalogs which include both
luminosities {\em and} colors -- thus providing realistic training sets for,
e.g., galaxy cluster finding algorithms. Our prescription is the first step
towards incorporating the entire spectral energy distribution into the halo
model approach.

are induced by the action of a certain group, Spin(n), on reals^n, in a way
that generalizes the action of the unit complex numbers, U(1), on reals^2, and
the action of the unit quaternions, SU(2), on reals^3 (i.e., the action is
defined in terms of multiplication in a larger algebra containing both the
group Spin(n) and reals^n). The group Spin(n), called a spinor group, is
defined as a certain subgroup of units of an algebra, Cl_n, the Clifford
algebra associated with reals^n.
  Since the spinor groups are certain well chosen subgroups of units of
Clifford algebras, it is necessary to investigate Clifford algebras to get a
firm understanding of spinor groups. These notes provide a tutorial on Clifford
algebra and the groups Spin and Pin, including a study of the structure of the
Clifford algebra Cl_{p, q} associated with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear
form of signature (p, q) and culminating in the beautiful ""8-periodicity

spectroscopic binary BD-22 5866 (=NLTT 53279, integrated spectral type = M0 V),
found during an ongoing search for the youngest M dwarfs in the solar
neighborhood. From the cross-correlation function, we are able to measure
relative flux levels, estimate the spectral types of the components, and set
upper limits on the orbital periods and separations. The resulting system is
hierarchical composed of K7 + K7 binary and a M1 + M2 binary with semi-major
axes of asini_{A}<=0.06 AU and asini_{B}<=0.30 AU. A subsequent search of the
SuperWASP photometric database revealed that the K7 + K7 binary is eclipsing
with a period of 2.21 days and at an inclination angle of 85 degrees. Within
uncertainties of 5%, the masses and radii of both components appear to be equal
(0.59 Msun, 0.61 Rsun). These two tightly orbiting stars (a = 0.035 AU) are in
synchronous rotation causing the observed excess Ca II, Halpha, X-ray and UV
emission. The fact that the system was unresolved with published adaptive
optics imaging, limits the projected physical separation of the two binaries at
the time of the observation to d_{AB} < 4.1 AU at the photometric distance of
51 pc. The maximum observed radial velocity difference between the A and B
binaries limits the orbit to asini_{AB}<=6.1 AU. As this tight configuration is
difficult to reproduce with current formation models of multiple systems, we
speculate that an early dynamical process reduced the size of the system such
as the interaction of the two binaries with a circumquadruple disk. Intensive
photometric, spectroscopic and interferometric monitoring as well as a parallax
measurement of this rare quadruple system is certainly warranted.

from equilibrium by focusing on the network structure of their state space. We
start by measuring the distributions of avalanche and transient times in Random
Boolean Networks (RBNs) and in the \emph{Drosophila} polarity network by exact
enumeration. A transient time is the duration of the transient from a starting
state to an attractor. An avalanche is a special transient which starts as
single Boolean element perturbation of an attractor state. Significant
differences at short times between the avalanche and the transient times for
RBNs with small connectivity $K$ -- compared to the number of elements $N$ --
indicate that attractors tend to cluster in configuration space. In addition,
one bit flip has a non-negligible chance to put an attractor state directly
onto another attractor. This clustering is also present in the segment polarity
gene network of \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, suggesting that this may be a
robust feature of biological regulatory networks. We also define and measure a
branching ratio for the state space networks and find evidence for a new time
scale that diverges roughly linearly with $N$ for $2\leq K \ll N$. Analytic
arguments show that this time scale does not appear in the random map nor can
the random map exhibit clustering of attractors. We further show that for K=2
the branching ratio exhibits the largest variation with distance from the
attractor compared to other values of $K$ and that the avalanche durations
exhibit no characteristic scale within our statistical resolution. Hence, we
propose that the branching ratio and the avalanche duration are new indicators
for scale-free behavior that may or may not be found simultaneously with other
indicators of emergent complexity in extended, deterministic dynamical systems.

Our approach takes advantage of the low concentration (1.1%) of Carbon-13 and
their random distribution in the diamond lattice by an algorithmic aggregation
of spins into small, strongly interacting groups. By making use of this
\emph{disjoint cluster} approach, we demonstrate a possibility of non-trival
dynamics of the electron spin that can not be described by a single time
constant. This dependance is caused by a strong coupling between the electron
and few nuclei and results, in particular, in a substantial echo signal even at
microsecond time scales. Our results are in good agreement with recent

interest because they defy unambiguous classification. Three proposed models
remain viable at this time, but none of the three is significantly more
compelling than the remaining two, and all three can satisfy the observational
constraints if parameters in the models are tuned. One of the three proposed
models is the direct impact model of Marsh & Steeghs (2002), in which the
accretion stream impacts the surface of a rapidly-rotating primary white dwarf
directly but at a near-glancing angle. One requirement of this model is that
the accretion stream have a high enough density to advect its specific kinetic
energy below the photosphere for progressively more-thermalized emission
downstream, a constraint that requires an accretion spot size of roughly
1.2x10^5 km^2 or smaller. Having at hand a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code
optimized for cataclysmic variable accretion disk simulations, it was
relatively straightforward for us to adapt it to calculate the footprint of the
accretion stream at the nominal radius of the primary white dwarf, and thus to
test this constraint of the direct impact model. We find that the mass flux at
the impact spot can be approximated by a bivariate Gaussian with standard
deviation \sigma_{\phi} = 164 km in the orbital plane and \sigma_{\theta} = 23
km in the perpendicular direction. The area of the the 2\sigma ellipse into
which 86% of the mass flux occurs is roughly 47,400 km^2, or roughly half the

  Moreover, this definition of a quantum knot system is intended to represent
the ""quantum embodiment"" of a closed knotted physical piece of rope. A quantum
knot, as a state of this system, represents the state of such a knotted closed
piece of rope, i.e., the particular spatial configuration of the knot tied in
the rope. Associated with a quantum knot system is a group of unitary
transformations, called the ambient group, which represents all possible ways
of moving the rope around (without cutting the rope, and without letting the
rope pass through itself.)
  Of course, unlike a classical closed piece of rope, a quantum knot can
exhibit non-classical behavior, such as quantum superposition and quantum
entanglement. This raises some interesting and puzzling questions about the
relation between topological and quantum entanglement.
  The knot type of a quantum knot is simply the orbit of the quantum knot under
the action of the ambient group. We investigate quantum observables which are
invariants of quantum knot type. We also study the Hamiltonians associated with
the generators of the ambient group, and briefly look at the quantum tunneling
of overcrossings into undercrossings.
  A basic building block in this paper is a mosaic system which is a formal
(rewriting) system of symbol strings. We conjecture that this formal system
fully captures in an axiomatic way all of the properties of tame knot theory.

unit and an idempotent that commute with each other. A recent result of
Borooah, Diesl and Dorsey \cite{BDD05a} completely characterized the
commutative local rings $R$ for which ${\mathbb M}_n(R)$ is strongly clean. For
a general local ring $R$ and $n>1$, however, it is unknown when the matrix ring
${\mathbb M}_n(R)$ is strongly clean. Here we completely determine the local
rings $R$ for which ${\mathbb M}_2(R)$ is strongly clean.

evacuations of buildings, ships, or other enclosed spaces. These offer
sophisticated tools for the study of human behaviour, the recreation of
environmental factors such as fire or smoke, and the inclusion of architectural
or structural features, such as elevators, pillars and exits. Although such
simulation environments can provide insights into crowd behaviour, they lack
the ability to examine potentially dangerous forces building up within a crowd.
These are commonly referred to as crush conditions, and are a common cause of
death in emergency evacuations.
  In this paper, we describe a methodology for the prediction and mitigation of
crush conditions. The paper is organised as follows. We first establish the
need for such a model, defining the main factors that lead to crush conditions,
and describing several exemplar case studies. We then examine current methods
for studying crush, and describe their limitations. From this, we develop a
three-stage hybrid approach, using a combination of techniques. We conclude
with a brief discussion of the potential benefits of our approach.

microscopy reveal the presence of a (10-10)-oriented hexagonal Co phase in the
Al2O3 sapphire substrate, but not in the ZnO film. Co clusters, with a diameter
of is about 5-6 nm, form a Co rich layer in the substrate close to the
ZnO/Al2O3 interface. Magnetization measurements indicate that there exist two
different magnetic phases in the implanted region. One originates from the Co
clusters in Al2O3, the other one belongs to a homogeneous ferromagnetic phase
with a ferromagnetic Curie temperature far above room temperature and can be
attributed to Co substitution on Zn sites in the ZnO layer. We have observed
magnetic dichroism at the Co L2,3 and O K edges at room temperature as well as
the multiplet structure in x-ray absorption spectra around the Co L3 edge,
supporting the intrinsic nature of the observed ferromagnetism in Co-implanted
ZnO film. The magnetic moment per substituted cobalt is found about 2.81 Bohr
magneton which is very close to the theoretical expected value of 3 Bohr
magneton per Co atom for Co 2+ in its high spin state.

of microscopic reversibility away from equilibrium. However, both theory and
experiments have shown deviations from microreversibility in the form of
magnetic field asymmetric current-voltage relations. We present novel
fluctuation relations for nonlinear transport in the presence of magnetic
fields that relate current correlation functions at any order at equilibrium to
response coefficients of current cumulants of lower order. We illustrate our
results with the example of an electrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

superlattices (FLSLs) -- two-dimensional electron gases subjected to a weak
potential modulation arranged in the Fibonacci sequence, LSLLSLS..., with
L/S=tau (the golden ratio). Complicated commensurability oscillation (CO) is
observed, which can be accounted for as a superposition of a series of COs each
arising from a sinusoidal modulation representing the characteristic length
scale of one of the self-similar generations in the Fibonacci sequence.
Individual CO components can be separated out from the magnetoresistance trace
by performing a numerical Fourier band-pass filter. From the analysis of the
amplitude of a single-component CO thus extracted, the magnitude of the
corresponding Fourier component in the potential modulation can be evaluated.
By examining all the Fourier contents observed in the magnetoresistance trace,
the profile of the modulated potential seen by the electrons can be
reconstructed with some remaining ambiguity about the interrelation of the
phase between different components.

study the H$\alpha$ emission sources in U Coronae Borealis. These 3D tomograms
provide greater resolution than the projected 2D version and highlight the
jet-like gas flows in the $V_z$ direction transverse to the orbital plane. In
this paper, the 3D tomograms are compared at two distinct epochs when U CrB was
in the disk-like state (1993 data) and the stream-like state (1994 data). Both
states display a prominent emission source, the circumprimary bulge, which is
produced when the gas stream strikes the photosphere of the mass-gainer. This
source is detected within $V_z$ = $\pm$150 km s{$^{-1}$}, and demonstrates that
the bulge is not confined to the orbital plane although it achieves maximum
strength near $V_z$=0 km s{$^{-1}$}. Other emission sources include the
stream-star and stream-disk shocks and a Localized Region (LR) where the
circling disk material strikes the incoming gas stream. The LR has $V_z$
velocities of 200 to 500 km s{$^{-1}$} in the disk-like state. The disk
emission is seen over a range of $V_z$ velocities, and there is evidence that
the disk is inclined to the orbital plane or may have two arms. The gas stream
flows along its predicted trajectory in the stream-like state, and a comparison
with the disk-like state suggests that the gas stream has a higher density than
the disk in both states of this binary.
