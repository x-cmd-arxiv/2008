and one axial-vector meson (VA), within the framework of QCD factorization,
where $A$ is either a $^3P_1$ or $^1P_1$ axial-vector meson. The main results
are as follows. (i) In the presence of NLO nonfactorizable corrections,
effective Wilson coefficients $a_i^h$ are helicity dependent. For some
penguin-dominated modes, the constructive (destructive) interference in the
negative-helicity (longitudinal-helicity) amplitude of the $B\to VV$ decay will
render the former comparable to the latter and push up the transverse
polarization. (ii) In QCD factorization, the transverse polarization fraction
can be large for penguin-dominated charmless $VV$ modes by allowing for sizable
penguin annihilation contributions. (iii) Using the measured $\bar
K^{*0}\rho^-$ channel as an input, we predict the branching ratios and
polarization fractions for other $\ov B\to \bar K^*\rho$ decays. (iv) The
smallness of the axial-vector decay constant of the $^1P_1$ axial vector meson
can be tested by measuring various $b_1\rho$ modes to see if $\Gamma(\bar
B^0\to b_1^-\rho^+)\ll \Gamma(\bar B^0\to b_1^+\rho^-)$ and $\Gamma(B^-\to
b_1^-\rho^0)\ll \Gamma(B^-\to b_1^0\rho^-)$. (v) For the penguin-dominated
modes $a_1K^*$ and $b_1K^*$, it is found that the former are dominated by
transverse polarization amplitudes, whereas the latter are governed by
longitudinal polarization states.

improving uplink confidentiality under constraints on the downlink rate that

tremendous progress in many areas of astronomy. The ability of the HST to peer
into the bright inner regions of galaxies and distinguish between globular
clusters (GCs) and background objects has been particularly beneficial to the
study of clusters. But the very virtue of the HST that has been an asset to
such research can be its pitfall if the consequences of superior angular
resolution are not considered in detail. Recent HST studies show a small, but
consistent, color-magnitude correlation in the metal-poor halo GCs of nearby
galaxies. This `blue-tilt' has been interpreted as a mass-metallicity
relationship, implying self-enrichment in the higher mass GCs. We show that the
`blue-tilt' is likely the consequence of a small, but measurable with HST,
mass-size relationship in GCs. The combined effects of Poisson noise and
surface brightness fluctuations can explain other apparent correlations of the
`blue-tilt' with environment. Some HST based studies have similarly suggested
that the mean metallicity of the blue, metal-poor, halo clusters increases with
host galaxy mass, indicating that GC metallicity is linked to the size of the
host galaxy halo. We show that this correlation is also likely due to the
effects of GC size in high resolution HST images. We also point out that the
presumed fundamental plane of GCs itself varies with galactocentric distance
due to GC size trends and ultra compact dwarfs may simply reflect the tail of
the globular cluster distribution.

Omega_Lambda (with an upper limit of Omega_Lambda ~ 1.15 at 90% confidence

techniques for solving the algorithmic problems arising in these models. A key
notable feature of our work that distinguishes it from work in some other
related models, such as the (standard) budget model and the (demand-) robust
model, is that we obtain results in the black-box setting, that is, where one
is given only sampling access to the underlying distribution. Our first model,
which we call the risk-averse budget model, incorporates the notion of
risk-averseness via a probabilistic constraint that restricts the probability
(according to the underlying distribution) with which the second-stage cost may
exceed a given budget B to at most a given input threshold \rho. We also a
consider a closely-related model that we call the risk-averse robust model,
where we seek to minimize the first-stage cost and the (1-\rho)-quantile of the
second-stage cost.
  We obtain approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial
optimization problems including the set cover, vertex cover, multicut on trees,
min cut, and facility location problems, in the risk-averse budget and robust
models with black-box distributions. We obtain near-optimal solutions that
preserve the budget approximately and incur a small blow-up of the probability
threshold (both of which are unavoidable). To the best of our knowledge, these
are the first approximation results for problems involving probabilistic
constraints and black-box distributions. A major component of our results is a
fully polynomial approximation scheme for solving the LP-relaxation of the
risk-averse problem.

function"" counting the rational representations of an algebraic group. For
these we determine precisely the abscissa of convergence. The local factor at a
finite place counts the finite representations of suitable open subgroups $U$
of the associated simple group $G$ over the associated local field $K$. Here we
show a surprising dichotomy: if $G(K)$ is compact (i.e. $G$ anisotropic over
$K$) the abscissa of convergence goes to 0 when $\dim G$ goes to infinity, but
for isotropic groups it is bounded away from 0. As a consequence, there is an
unconditional positive lower bound for the abscissa for arbitrary finitely
generated linear groups. We end with some observations and conjectures
regarding the global abscissa.

investigated within the framework of the distorted wave impulse
approximation(DWIA). The amplitude for the elementary process is evaluated in a
fully covariant two-nucleon model based on the effective Lagrangian. The
reaction cross sections for $\Lambda$-hypernucleus productions on $^6Li$,
$^{12}C$ and $^{16}O$ targets are calculated. It is found that the distortion
effects tend to reduce the cross sections by a factor of 3$\sim$10. Various
differential cross sections (DCS) and double differential cross sections (DDCS)
are presented. It is shown that for the $s_{\Lambda}-$wave hypernucleus
production, the DCS is decreased with increasing nuclear mass, and the DCS for
the $p_{\Lambda}-$wave hypernucleus production is normally higher than that for
the $s_{\Lambda}-$wave hypernucleus production. As a reference, the DDCS with
respect to the momenta of the outgoing proton and kaon is also demonstrated.
Finally, the missing mass spectra of the inclusive reaction $p+A\to p+ K^+ + X$
for $^6Li$, $^{12}C$ and $^{16}O$ targets are presented, from which the masses
of hypernuclei can accurately be extracted. Thus, we conclude that the missing
mass spectrum method is an alternative to study hypernuclear physics. And the
study of hypernuclear physics can be carried out in COSY and CSR by the
$A(p,pK^+)_{\Lambda}B$ reaction due to the $\mu$b-order reaction cross
sections.

gauge-invariant variable which describes the perturbation to the energy density
and which becomes equal to the usual energy density of the Newtonian theory of
gravity in the limit that all particle velocities are negligible with respect
to the speed of light. The same holds true for the perturbation to the particle
number density. A cosmological perturbation theory based on these particular
gauge-invariant quantities is more precise than any earlier first-order
perturbation theory. In particular, it explains star formation in a
satisfactory way, even in the absence of cold dark matter. In a baryon-only
universe, the earliest stars, the so-called Population III stars, are found to
have masses between 400 and 100,000 solar masses with a peak around 3400 solar
masses. If cold dark matter, with particle mass 10 times heavier than the
proton mass, is present then the star masses are between 16 and 4000 solar
masses with a peak around 140 solar masses. They come into existence between
100 Myr and 1000 Myr. At much later times, star formation is possible only in
high density regions, for example within galaxies. Late time stars may have
much smaller masses than early stars. The smallest stars that can be formed
have masses of 0.2--0.8 solar mass, depending on the initial internal relative
pressure perturbation. It is demonstrated that the Newtonian theory of gravity

difficulties when trying to extract the scattered halo near the source. The
initial study of the X-ray halo around GX13+1 using only the ACIS-I detector
done by Smith, Edgar & Shafer (2002) suffered from a lack of sensitivity within
50'' of the source, limiting what conclusions could be drawn.
  To address this problem, observations of GX13+1 were obtained with the
Chandra HRC-I and simultaneously with the RXTE PCA. Combined with the existing
ACIS-I data, this allowed measurements of the X-ray halo between 2-1000''.
After considering a range of dust models, each assumed to be smoothly
distributed with or without a dense cloud along the line of sight, the results

differ with the number of ensemble teachers. Furthermore, we show that the
smaller the switching period is, the larger the difference is.

entirely different ways. The first is well-known: the laminar Sweet-Parker
process. But a second, completely different and chaotic reconnection process is
possible. This regime has properties of immediate practical relevance: i) it is
much faster, developing on scales of the order of the Alfv\'en time, and ii)
the areas of reconnection become distributed chaotically over a macroscopic
region. The onset of the faster process is the formation of closed circulation
patterns where the jets going out of the reconnection regions turn around and
forces their way back in, carrying along copious amounts of magnetic flux.

quintessence field. We demonstrate that the new agegraphic evolution of the
universe can be described completely by a single quintessence field. Its
potential as a function of the quintessence field is reconstructed numerically.
In particular, the analytical solution of the new agegraphic quintessence dark
energy model (NAQDE) is approximately obtained in the matter-dominated epoch.
Furthermore, we investigate the evolution of the NAQDE model in the
$\omega-\omega'$ phase plane. It turns out that by quantum corrections, the
trajectory of this model lies outside the thawing and freezing regions at early
times. But at late times, it enters the freezing regions and gradually
approaches to a static cosmological constant state in the future. Therefore the
NAQDE should belong to the freezing model at late times. For comparison, we
further extend this model by including the interaction between the NADE and DM
and discuss its evolution in the $\omega-\omega'$ phase plane.
