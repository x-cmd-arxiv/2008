elliptical galaxies established that their progenitors, unlike those of long
GRBs, belong to an old stellar population. However, the majority of short GRBs
appear to occur in star forming galaxies, raising the possibility that some
progenitors are related to recent star formation activity. Here we present
optical spectroscopy of these hosts and measure their luminosities, star
formation rates, and metallicities. We find luminosities of L_B~0.1-1.5 L*,
star formation rates of SFR~0.2-6 M_sun/yr, and metallicities of
12+log(O/H)~8.5-8.9 (Z~0.6-1.6 Z_sun). A detailed comparison to the hosts of
long GRBs reveals systematically higher luminosities, lower specific star
formation rates (SFR/L_B) by about an order of magnitude, and higher
metallicities by about 0.6 dex. The K-S probability that the short and long GRB
hosts are drawn from the same underlying galaxy distribution is only 10^-3. On
the other hand, short GRB hosts exhibit excellent agreement with the specific
star formation rates and the luminosity-metallicity relation of field galaxies
at z~0.1-1. We thus conclude that short GRB hosts are not dominated by young
stellar populations like long GRBs hosts. Instead, short GRB hosts appear to be
drawn uniformly from the underlying galaxy distribution, indicating that the
progenitors have a wide age distribution of several Gyr.

are intermediate polars where the magnetic field is strong enough to channel
the accreting matter to the magnetic poles of the white dwarf. A shock above
the stellar surface heats the gas to fairly high temperatures (10--100 keV).
The post-shock region cools mostly via optically thin bremsstrahlung. We
investigate the influence of Compton scattering on the structure and the
emergent spectrum of the post-shock region. We also study the effect it has on
the mass of the white dwarfs obtained from fitting the observed X-ray spectrum
of intermediate polars. We construct the model of the post-shock region taking
Compton scattering into account. The radiation transfer equation is solved in
the plane-parallel approximation. The feedback of Compton scattering on the
structure of the post-shock region is also accounted for. A set of the
post-shock region model spectra for various white dwarf masses is calculated.
We find that Compton scattering does not change the emergent spectra
significantly for low accretion rates or low white dwarf masses. However, it
becomes important at high accretion rates and high white dwarf masses. The
time-averaged, broad-band X-ray spectrum of intermediate polar V709 Cas

important and closely-related versions of market-entry games designed to model
different features of real-world financial markets. In a variant of these
games, agents measure the performance of their available strategies over a
fixed-length rolling window of prior time-steps. These are the so-called Time
Horizon MG/MAJG/$G (THMG, THMAJG, TH$G). Their probabilistic dynamics may be
completely characterized in Markov-chain formulation. Games of both the
standard and TH variants generate time-series that may be understood as arising
from a stochastically perturbed determinism because a coin toss is used to
break ties. The average over the binomially-distributed coin-tosses yields the
underlying determinism. In order to quantify the degree of this determinism and
of higher-order perturbations, we decompose the sign of the time-series they
generate (analogous to a market price time series) into a superposition of
weighted Hamiltonian cycles on graphs (exactly in the TH variants and
approximately in the standard versions). The cycle decomposition also provides
a ``dissection'' of the internal dynamics of the games and a quantitative
measure of the degree of determinism. We discuss how the outperformance of
strategies relative to agents in the THMG (the ``illusion of control'') and the
reverse in the THMAJG and TH$G (i.e., genuine control) may be understood on a
cycle-by-cycle basis. The decomposition offers as well a new metric for
comparing different game dynamics to real-world financial time-series and a
method for generating predictors. We apply the cycle predictor a real-world
market, with significantly positive returns for the latter.

the suppression by the low neutrino absorption cross section of the signal in
conventional neutrino oscillation experiments. The normally unobservable long
wave lengths are made observable by having the radioactive source move a long
distance circulating around in a storage ring. A new oscillation phenomenon
with nonexponential decay arises in this ""watched pot"" experiment where
continous monitoring sets the decay clock back to zero while preserving
oscillating phases in the initial state. The initial ion wave packet has a
momentum spread required by Heisenberg and contains pairs of components with
different momenta and energies. These can produce neutrino amplitudes in two
mass eigenstates with different momenta which mix to produce a single $\nu_e$
state. In this typical quantum mechanics ""two-slit"" or ""which path"" experiment
a transition between the same initial and final states can go via two paths in
energy-momentum space. Their relative phases change with the propagation of the
initial state between the points of entry and decay. The oscillations produced

self-organized criticality. Behavior of these systems can be investigated from
two different points of view: interoccurrent behavior in a region and recurrent
behavior at a given point on a fault or at a given fault. The interoccurrent
frequency-size statistics are known to be scale-invariant and obey the
power-law Gutenberg-Richter distribution. This paper investigates the recurrent
frequency-size behavior of characteristic events at a given point on a fault or
at a given fault. For this purpose sequences of creep events at a creeping
section of the San Andreas fault are investigated. The applicability of the
Brownian passage-time, lognormal, and Weibull distributions to the recurrent
frequency-size statistics of slip events is tested and the Weibull distribution
is found to be a best-fit distribution. To verify this result the behaviors of
the numerical slider-block and sand-pile models are investigated and the
applicability of the Weibull distribution is confirmed. Exponents of the
best-fit Weibull distributions for the observed creep event sequences and for
the slider-block model are found to have close values from 1.6 to 2.2 with the
corresponding aperiodicities of the applied distribution from 0.47 to 0.64.

analyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain
object. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and
its functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and
infothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set
of parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to
equal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the
previously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three
functions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects
including two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the
group into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP
weight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the
query object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter
values, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP
multiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A
respective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)
between the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the
difference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly
increases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new
approach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of

magnetic state can be switched via fabrication steps which modify the film
structure, offering practical routes into information processing. Theoretical
calculations show that a new mechanism, which is the molecular analogue of the
interactions between magnetic ions in metals, is responsible for the magnetic
states. Our combination of theory and experiments opens the field of organic
thin film magnetic engineering.

asymptotic consistency and an efficient score representation of the estimators
are obtained under the assumption that the effective dimension grows at a rate
slower than the sample size. These results are derived through an explicit
utilization of the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, which is
non-Euclidean. Moreover, the results derived in this paper suggest an

across T_c, we find that the electric condensate increases abruptly above T_c.
Similar abrupt change is also seen in the scalar condensate. Using the QCD
second-order Stark effect and QCD sum rules, we show that these sudden changes
induce equally abrupt changes in the mass and width of J/psi, both of which are
larger than 100 MeV at slightly above T_c.

forecasting by allowing the detection of sunspot regions before they become
visible on the Earth side of the Sun. An accurate assessment of the quality of
the far-side maps is difficult, because there are no direct observations of the

to model the perturbations associated with sunspots and active regions. We
examine how the accuracy of the resulting far-side maps of acoustic travel
times depends on the size and location of active regions. We investigate

the presence of active regions on the solar near side, and suggest how these

source J1427+3312 (z=6.12) has recently been identified as the first and so far
the only known radio-loud quasar at z>6.
  Aims: We investigated the compact radio structure of J1427+3312 on
milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scales, to compare it with that of the second
most distant radio-loud quasar J0836+0054 (z=5.77) and with lower-redshift
radio quasars in general. Methods: We observed J1427+3312 in phase-reference
mode with ten antennas of the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz on 11 March 2007 and at 5 GHz on 3 March 2007.
Results: The source was clearly detected at both frequencies. At 1.6 GHz, it
shows a prominent double structure. The two components are separated by 8.3
mas, corresponding to a projected linear distance of ~160 pc. Both components
with sub-mJy flux densities appear resolved. In the position of the brightest
component at 1.6 GHz, we detected mas-scale radio emission at 5 GHz as well.
The radio spectrum of this feature is steep. The double structure and the
separation of the components of J1427+3312 are similar to those of the young

of the two classes of cool-core and non-cool-core clusters. We first refer to a
two-component dynamical model that ignores the contribution from the galaxy
density distribution and study the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for the
hot intracluster medium (ICM) under the assumption of spherical symmetry, in
the presence of dark matter. We model the ICM density distribution in terms of
a standard $\beta$-model with $\beta=2/3$, i.e. with a distribution similar to
that of a regular isothermal sphere (RIS), and fit the observed X-ray
brightness profiles. With the explicit purpose of ignoring cosmological
arguments, we na\""ively assume that dark matter, if present, has an analogous
density distribution, with the freedom of two different density and length
scales. The relative distribution of visible and dark matter is then derived by
fitting the temperature data for the ICM under conditions of hydrostatic
equilibrium. For both clusters, we find that dark matter is more concentrated
with respect to visible matter. We then test whether the conclusion changes
significantly when dark matter is taken to be distributed according to
cosmologically favored density profiles and when the contribution of the mass
contained in galaxies is taken into account. Although the qualitative
conclusions remain unchanged, we find that the contribution of galaxies to the
mass budget is more important than generally assumed. We also show that,
without resorting to additional information on the small scale, it is not
possible to tell whether a density cusp is present or absent in these systems.

specifically it is the one with the highest duty cycle. Aims: to characterize
the quiescent X-ray behaviour of the source and to compare its broad band
spectrum to that during fast X-ray flares. Methods: we performed an analysis of
IBIS and JEM-X data with OSA 5.1 as well as an analysis of archival Swift/XRT
data. Results: we present results from a long term monitoring of IGR
J16479-4514 with detailed spectral and timing informations on 19 bright fast
X-ray flares, 10 of which newly discovered. We also report for the first time
results on the quiescent X-ray emission; the typical luminosity value (about
10^34 erg s^-1) is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than that typical of
SFXTs while its broad band X-ray spectrum has a shape very similar to that
during fast X-ray transient activity, i.e. a rather steep power law with
Gamma=2.6. Conclusions: IGR J16479$-$4514 is characterized by a quiescent X-ray
luminosity higher than that typical of other known SFXTs but lower than
persistent emission from classical SGXBs. We suggest that such source is a kind
of transition object between these two systems, supporting the idea that there
is a continuum of behaviours between the class of SFXTs and that of classical
persistent SGXBs.

physical properties of the hot (~20 keV) gas clump in the south-east (SE)
region discovered by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect observations, to
understand the gas physics of a violent cluster merger. We also explore a
signature of non-thermal emission using the hard X-ray data. Results: We find
that the single-temperature model fails to reproduce the continuum emission and
Fe-K lines measured by XIS simultaneously. The two-temperature model with a
very hot component improves the fit, although the XIS data can only give a
lower bound on its temperature. We detect the hard X-ray emission in the 12-40
keV band at the 7 sigma level; however, the significance becomes marginal when
the systematic error in the background estimation is included. With the Suzaku
+ Chandra joint analysis, we determine the temperature of the SE excess
component to be 25.3^{+6.1}_{-4.5} ^{+6.9}_{-9.5} keV (90% statistical and
systematic errors), which is in an excellent agreement with the previous SZ +
X-ray analysis. This is the first time that the X-ray spectroscopy alone gives
a good measurement of the temperature of the hot component in the SE region,
which is made possible by Suzaku's unprecedented sensitivity to the wide X-ray
band. These results strongly indicate that the cluster has undergone a recent,
violent merger. The spectral analysis shows that the SE component is consistent
with being thermal. We find the 3 sigma upper limit on the non-thermal flux, F
< 8e-12 erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 12-60 keV band. Combining this limit with a
recent discovery of the radio mini halo at 1.4 GHz, we find a lower limit on

solving for the spectrum is well known; it does not involve a perturbation
expansion in the interaction, and needs no assumption of a weak interaction. We

exhibited by M*(B,T) when a strongly correlated electron system transits from

that have mainly been published within the physics-oriented complex networks
literature. The models fall into two categories: those in which the addition of
new links is dependent on the (typically local) network structure (network
evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on
nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph
model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit
models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks
with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in
the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining
which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to
degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path
distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal
connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce
assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate
unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not
match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the
network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra
that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and
community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The
ERG model turns out to produce the weakest community structure.

the possibility of a lack of objects with 10^{21} < Nh < 10^{22} cm^{-2}, as
expected if absorption originates either in a torus-like structure or in the
host galaxy. We find that the Log N-Log S diagram of our sources is compatible

different, with significantly less unabsorbed sources (Nh<10^{22} cm^{-2}) at a

function, which is compatible with what is found in other recent hard X-ray

value of the entropy is unambiguous despite gauge invariance and the
renormalization procedure. At the first level of truncation, the reduced
density matrices are Gaussian and the entropy is the only intrinsic quantity.
In this case, the quantum-to-classical transition concerns the entanglement of
modes of opposite wave-vectors, and the threshold of classicality is that of
separability. The relations to other criteria of classicality are established.
We explain why, during inflation, most of these criteria are not intrinsic. We
complete our analysis by showing that all reduced density matrices can be
written as statistical mixtures of minimal states, the squeezed properties of
which are less constrained as the entropy increases. Pointer states therefore
appear not to be relevant to the discussion. The entropy is calculated for

refinements in time using different time steps in different regions of space.
We discuss and analyze two conservative approximations based on finite volume
with piecewise constant projections and domain decomposition techniques. Next
we present an iterative method for solving the composite-grid system that
reduces to solution of standard problems with standard time stepping on the
coarse and fine grids. At every step of the algorithm, conservativity is
ensured. Finally, numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed
methods.

plane-parallel models with the MARCS program, and make it available for public

(cgs) with various masses and radii, [Me/H]=-5 to +1, with [Alpha/Fe] = 0.0 and
0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances to also represent stars of
types R, S and N, and with microturbulence parameters from 1 to 5 km/s. We also
list fluxes in approximately 108,000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions
in addition to 1D stratification include hydrostatic equilibrium, MLT
convection and LTE. A number of general properties of the models are discussed,
in relation to the effects of changing blanketing and sphericity.
  Models are compared with other available grids and excellent agreement is
found with plane-parallel models of Castelli and Kurucz within the overlapping
parameter range. Although there are departures from the spherically symmetric
NextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying.
The models of the grid show regularities, but some interesting departures from
general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities.
We have tested rules of thumb concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity
and found them to often be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new
phenomena have been discovered, such as the intricate coupling between
blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on
metal-poor models. We give further details of models and comparisons with
observations in subsequent papers.

  equations",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider nonlinear parabolic SPDEs of the form $\partial_t u=\sL u +
\sigma(u)\dot w$, where $\dot w$ denotes space-time white noise,
$\sigma:\R\to\R$ is [globally] Lipschitz continuous, and $\sL$ is the
$L^2$-generator of a L\'evy process. We present precise criteria for existence
as well as uniqueness of solutions. More significantly, we prove that these
solutions grow in time with at most a precise exponential rate. We establish
also that when $\sigma$ is globally Lipschitz and asymptotically sublinear, the
solution to the nonlinear heat equation is ``weakly intermittent,'' provided
that the symmetrization of $\sL$ is recurrent and the initial data is
sufficiently large.
  Among other things, our results lead to general formulas for the upper
second-moment Liapounov exponent of the parabolic Anderson model for $\sL$ in
dimension $(1+1)$. When $\sL=\kappa\partial_{xx}$ for $\kappa>0$, these
formulas agree with the earlier results of statistical physics
\cite{Kardar,KrugSpohn,LL63}, and also probability theory \cite{BC,CM94} in the
two exactly-solvable cases where $u_0=\delta_0$ and $u_0\equiv 1$.

parameters are usually determined from emission line ratios, obtained from
spectroscopic observations or using the information contained in narrow band
images. The basic hypothesis in the interpretation of the observations is that
the emitting region is homogeneous along the line of sight. Actually, stellar
jets are in general not homogeneous, and therefore line of sight convolution
effects may lead to the main uncertainty in the determination of the physical
parameters.
  AIMS: This paper is aimed at showing the systematic errors introduced when
assuming an homogeneous medium, and studying the effect of an inhomogeneous
medium on plasma diagnostics for the case of a stellar jet. In addition, we
explore how to reconstruct the volumetric physical parameters of the jet (i.
e., with dependence both across and along the line of sight).
  METHODS: We use standard techniques to determine the physical parameters, i.
e., the electron density, temperature and hydrogen ionisation fraction across
the jet, and a multi-Gaussian method to invert the Abel transform and determine
the reconstructed physical structure.
  RESULTS: When assuming an homogeneous medium the physical parameters,
integrated along the line of sight, do not represent the average of the true
values, and do not have a clear physical interpretation. We show that when some
information is available on the emissivity profile across the jet, it is then
possible to obtain appropriate derivations of the electron density, temperature
and ionisation fraction.

master equation, which we term quantum Bloch-Boltzmann equation, is derived,
describing both motional and internal states of a test particle in a quantum
framework. When due to the preparation of the system or to decoherence effects
one of the two degrees of freedom is amenable to a classical treatment and not
resolved in the final measurement, though relevant for the interaction with the
reservoir, non-Markovian behaviors such as stretched exponential or power law
decay of coherences can be put into evidence.

generalization of the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancelation in heterotic string
theory which demands the target space to have a String structure, we observe
that the ""magnetic dual"" version of the anomaly cancelation condition can be
read as a higher analog of String structure, which we call Fivebrane structure.
This involves lifts of orthogonal and unitary structures through higher
connected covers which are not just 3- but even 7-connected. We discuss the
topological obstructions to the existence of Fivebrane structures. The dual
version of the anomaly cancelation points to a relation of String and Fivebrane
structures under electric-magnetic duality.
