and anomalous diffusion. Starting from simple, but well known experiments, a
series of mathematical modeling tools are introduced, and the relation between
them is made clear. First, we show how Brownian motion can be understood in
terms of a simple random walk model. Normal diffusion is then treated (i)
through formalizing the random walk model and deriving a classical diffusion
equation, (ii) by using Fick's law that leads again to the same diffusion
equation, and (iii) by using a stochastic differential equation for the
particle dynamics (the Langevin equation), which allows to determine the mean
square displacement of particles. (iv) We discuss normal diffusion from the
point of view of probability theory, applying the Central Limit Theorem to the
random walk problem, and (v) we introduce the more general Fokker-Planck
equation for diffusion that includes also advection. We turn then to anomalous
diffusion, discussing first its formal characteristics, and proceeding to
Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) as a model for anomalous diffusion. It is
shown how CTRW can be treated formally, the importance of probability
distributions of the Levy type is explained, and we discuss the relation of
CTRW to fractional diffusion equations and show how the latter can be derived
from the CTRW equations. Last, we demonstrate how a general diffusion equation
can be derived for Hamiltonian systems, and we conclude this tutorial with a
few recent applications of the above theories in laboratory and astrophysical
plasmas.

resonator is coupled with two small gaps to a transmission line with a 50 Ohms
impedance. Different resonator lengths are used to obtain quasi-TEM fundamental
resonant modes in the frequency range 10-30 GHz. The resonator is positioned on
top of the active area of the Hall-effect magnetometer, where the magnetic
field of the fundamental mode is largest, thus optimizing the conversion of
microwave power into magnetic field at the sample position. The two gaps
coupling the resonator and transmission lines are engineered differently. The
gap to the microwave source is designed to optimize the loaded quality factor
of the resonator (Q = 150) while the gap for the transmitted signal is larger.
This latter gap minimizes losses and prevents distortion of the resonance while
enabling measurement of the transmitted signal. The large filling factor of the
resonator permits sensitivities comparable to that of high-quality factor
resonant cavities. The integrated sensor enables measurement of the
magnetization response of micron scale samples upon application of microwave
fields. In particular, the combined measurement of the magnetization change and
the microwave power under cw microwave irradiation of single crystal of
molecular magnets is used to determine of the energy relaxation time of the

such as $^{26}$Al (T$_{1/2} = 0.74$ Myr) and $^{60}$Fe (T$_{1/2} = 1.5$ Myr),
it is often asserted that the Sun was born in a large stellar cluster, where a
massive star contaminated the protoplanetary disk with freshly
nucleosynthesized isotopes from its supernova (SN) explosion. To account for
the inferred initial solar system abundances of short-lived radionuclides, this
supernova had to be close ($\sim$ 0.3 pc) to the young ($\leqslant$ 1 Myr)
protoplanetary disk.
  Here we show that massive star evolution timescales are too long, compared to
typical timescales of star formation in embedded clusters, for them to explode
as supernovae within the lifetimes of nearby disks. This is especially true in
an Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC)-type of setting, where the most massive star
will explode as a supernova $\sim$ 5 Myr after the onset of star formation,
when nearby disks will have already suffered substantial photoevaporation
and/or formed large planetesimals.
  We quantify the probability for {\it any} protoplanetary disk to receive SRs
from a nearby supernova at the level observed in the early solar system. Key
constraints on our estimate are: (1) SRs have to be injected into a newly
formed ($\leqslant$ 1 Myr) disk, (2) the disk has to survive UV
photoevaporation, and (3) the protoplanetary disk must be situated in an
enrichment zone permitting SR injection at the solar system level without disk
disruption. The probability of protoplanetary disk contamination by a supernova
ejecta is, in the most favorable case, 3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$.

spin-S on a square-type lattice including a quartic interaction term in the
Hamiltonian. The particular properties of the mixed lattice, associated with
mixed half-odd-integer spin-(S,1/2) and only nearest-neighbour interaction,
allow us to map this system either onto a purely spin-1/2 lattice or onto a
purely spin-S lattice. By imposing the condition that the mixed
half-odd-integer spin-(S,1/2) lattice must have an exact solution, we found a
set of exact solutions that satisfy the {\it free fermion} condition of the
eight vertex model. The number of solutions for a general half-odd-integer
spin-S is given by $S+1/2$. Therefore we conclude that this transformation is
equivalent to a simple spin transformation which is independent of the
coordination number.

toward a ~1 min x 1 min region within the northern lobe of the outflow from NGC
2071 using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) of the Spitzer Space Telescope.
These observations covered the 5.2-37 um spectral region and have led to the
detection of a number of ionic, atomic, and molecular lines, including
fine-structure emission of Si+, Fe+, S++, S, the S(0)-S(7) pure rotational
lines of H2, the R(3) and R(4) transitions of HD, and at least 11 transitions
of H2O. In addition, the 6.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.9, 8.6 and 11.3 um PAH emission bands
were also observed and several transitions of OH were tentatively detected.
Most of the detected line transitions were strong enough to map including, for
the first time, three transitions of hot H2O. We find that: (1) the water
emission is extended; (2) the extended emission is aligned with the outflow;
and, (3) the spatial distribution of the water emission generally follows that
observed for H2. Based on the measured line intensities, we derive an HD
abundance relative to H2 of 1.1-1.8 10^-5 and an H2O number density of 12-2
cm^3. The H2 density in the water-emitting region is not well constrained by
our observations, but is likely between 3 10^4 and 10^6 cm^3, yielding an H2O
abundance relative to H2 of between 2 10^-5 and 6 10^-4. Future observations
planned for the Herschel Space Observatory should greatly improve the density
estimate, and thus our knowledge of the H2O abundance, for the water-emitting
regions reported here. Finally, we note a possible departure from the H2O
ortho-to-para ratio of 3:1 expected for water formed in hot post-shocked gas,
suggesting that a significant fraction of the water vapor we detect may arise
from H2O sputtered from cold dust grains.

multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems are based on sphere-decoding (SD). The
conventional (and optimum) norm that is used to conduct the tree traversal step
in SD is the l-2 norm. It was, however, recently observed that using the
l-infinity norm instead reduces the hardware complexity of SD considerably at
only a marginal performance loss. These savings result from a reduction in the
length of the critical path in the circuit and the silicon area required for
metric computation, but are also, as observed previously through simulation
results, a consequence of a reduction in the computational (i.e., algorithmic)
complexity. The aim of this paper is an analytical performance and
computational complexity analysis of l-infinity norm SD. For i.i.d. Rayleigh
fading MIMO channels, we show that l-infinity norm SD achieves full diversity
order with an asymptotic SNR gap, compared to l-2 norm SD, that increases at
most linearly in the number of receive antennas. Moreover, we provide a
closed-form expression for the computational complexity of l-infinity norm SD
based on which we establish that its complexity scales exponentially in the
system size. Finally, we characterize the tree pruning behavior of l-infinity
norm SD and show that it behaves fundamentally different from that of l-2 norm
SD.

fully-developed compressible turbulence is considered. The multi-fractal power
law scaling behavior breaks down for very small length scales thanks to viscous
effects. However, the effect of compressibility is found to extend the
single-scaling multi-fractal regime further into the dissipative range. In the
ultimate compressibility limit, thanks to the shock waves which are the
appropriate dissipative structures, the single-scaling regime is found to
extend indeed all the way into the full viscous regime. This result appears to
be consistent with the physical fact that vortices stretch stronger in a
compressible fluid hence postponing viscous intervention. The consequent
generation of enhanced velocity gradients in a compressible fluid appears to
provide an underlying physical basis for the previous results indicating that
fully-developed compressible turbulence is effectively more dissipative than
its incompressible counterpart.

new distributed space-time block code called the cascaded orthogonal space-time
block code (COSTBC) for the case where the source and destination are equipped
with multiple antennas and each relay stage has one or more single antenna
relays. Each relay stage is assumed to have receive channel state information
(CSI) for all the channels from the source to itself, while the destination is
assumed to have receive CSI for all the channels. To construct the COSTBC,
multiple orthogonal space-time block codes are used in cascade by the source
and each relay stage. In the COSTBC, each relay stage separates the
constellation symbols of the orthogonal space-time block code sent by the
preceding relay stage using its CSI, and then transmits another orthogonal
space-time block code to the next relay stage. COSTBCs are shown to achieve the
maximum diversity gain in a multi-hop wireless network with flat Rayleigh
fading channels. Several explicit constructions of COSTBCs are also provided
for two-hop wireless networks with two and four source antennas and relay
nodes. It is also shown that COSTBCs require minimum decoding complexity thanks

signals due to fluctuations in their cellular environment and in the inputs

probability that a neuron will send out a signal to its target cells 2-5. In
stochastic resonance, which occurs in many physical and biological systems, an
optimal response is found at a particular noise amplitude 6-9. We have found
that in a classical neuronal model the opposite can occur - that noise can
subdue or turn off repetitive neuronal activity in both single cells and
networks of cells. Recent experiments on regularly firing neurons with noisy
inputs confirm these predictions 10,11. Surprisingly, we find that in some
cases there is a noise level at which the response is a minimum, a phenomenon
which is called inverse stochastic resonance. Suppression of rhythmic behavior
by noise and inverse stochastic resonance are predicted to occur not only in
neuronal systems but more generally in diverse nonlinear dynamical systems

of the lack of strong transition from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared. Here
we analyse the absorption spectrum of HD209458b obtained by Sing et al. (2008a)

HD209458b. Since Rayleigh scattering traces the entire atmosphere, this
detection enables a direct determination of the pressure-altitude relationship,
which is required to determine the absolute fraction of other elements such as
sodium. At the zero altitude defined by the absorption depth of 1.453%, which
corresponds to a planetary radius of 0.1205 times the stellar radius, we find a
pressure of 33+/-5 mbar. Using the variation of the Rayleigh scattering
cross-section as a function of wavelength, we determine the temperature to be

molecular clouds (MCs) are based on ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). However,
MCs are weakly ionized, so that the time scale required for the magnetic field
to diffuse through the neutral component of the plasma by ambipolar diffusion
(AD) can be comparable to the dynamical time scale. We have performed a series
of 256^3 and 512^3 simulations on supersonic but sub-Alfvenic turbulent systems
with AD using the Heavy-Ion Approximation developed in Li, McKee, & Klein
(2006). Our calculations are based on the assumption that the number of ions is
conserved, but we show that these results approximately apply to the case of
time-dependent ionization in molecular clouds as well. Convergence studies
allow us to determine the optimal value of the ionization mass fraction when
using the heavy-ion approximation for low Mach number, sub-Alfvenic turbulent
systems. We find that ambipolar diffusion steepens the velocity and magnetic
power spectra compared to the ideal MHD case. Changes in the density PDF, total
magnetic energy, and ionization fraction are determined as a function of the AD
Reynolds number. The power spectra for the neutral gas properties of a strongly
magnetized medium with a low AD Reynolds number are similar to those for a
weakly magnetized medium; in particular, the power spectrum of the neutral
velocity is close to that for Burgers turbulence.

single channel scattering. Whereas the expression due to Smith which is derived
from a time delayed radial wave packet is consistent with a lifetime matrix
which is Hermitian, this is not true for any Eisenbud-type lifetime matrix
which violates time reversal invariance. Extending the angular time delay of
Nussenzveig to multiple channels, we show that if one performs an average over
the directions and subtracts the forward angle contribution containing an
interference of the incident and scattered waves, the multichannel angle
dependent average time delay reduces to the one given by Smith. The present

proposed explicit construction of expanded generator matrix and expanded parity

important original characteristics. The second purpose of this paper is to
identify a class of constant-weight cyclic codes. Specifically, we show that a
well-known class of $q$-ary BCH codes excluding the all-zero codeword are
constant-weight cyclic codes. Moreover, we show this class of codes achieve the
Plotkin bound. The last purpose of the paper is to characterize expanded cyclic
codes utilizing the proposed expanded generator matrix and parity check matrix.
We characterize the properties of component codewords of a codeword and
particularly identify the precise conditions under which a codeword can be
represented by a subbasis. Our developments reveal an alternative while more
general view on the subspace subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. With the new
insights, we present an improved lower bound on the minimum distance of an
expanded cyclic code by exploiting the generalized concatenated structure. We
also show that the fixed-rate binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes are
asymptotically ""bad"", in the sense that the ratio of minimum distance over code
length diminishes with code length going to infinity. It overturns the
prevalent conjecture that they are ""good"" codes and deviates from the ensemble

by observing Coulomb refraction changes induced by the modified space-charge
barrier within a selectively probed volume by femtosecond electron pulses. The
results are in agreement with ultrafast photoemission studies of surface state
charging, suggesting a charge relaxation mechanism closely coupled to the
carrier dynamics near the surface that can be described by a drift-diffusion
model. This study demonstrates a newly implemented ultrafast diffraction method
for investigating interfacial processes, with both charge and structure
resolution.

galaxies are visually classified. We found segregation of satellite morphology
as a function of the projected distance from the host galaxy. The amplitude and
shape of the early-type satellite fraction profile are found to depend on the
host luminosity. This is the morphology-radius/density relation at the galactic
scale. There is a strong tendency for morphology conformity between the host
galaxy and its satellites. The early-type fraction of satellites hosted by
early-type galaxies is systematically larger than that of late-type hosts, and
is a strong function of the distance from the host galaxies. Fainter satellites
are more vulnerable to the morphology transformation effects of hosts.
Dependence of satellite morphology on the large-scale background density was
detected. The fraction of early-type satellites increases in high density
regions for both early and late-type hosts. It is argued that the conformity in

hydrodynamical and radiative effects of hosts on satellites.

investigations indicate that fringing electric fields lead to switching via 90
deg domain wedge nucleation for thicker films while at smaller thicknesses, the
polarization switches directly by 180 deg rotations. The voltage required to
switch the domain increases by decreasing the lateral size and at very small
lateral sizes the coercive voltage becomes so large that it becomes virtually
impossible to switch the domain. In all cases, the width of the switched region

produced via collinear degenerate optical spontaneous parametric downconversion
(SPDC), in which both second-order (one-photon) and fourth-order (two-photon)
interferograms are recorded in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). In the
first experiment, high-visibility fringes are obtained for both the second- and
fourth-order interferograms. In the second experiment, the MZI is modified by
the removal of a mirror from one of its arms; this leaves the fourth-order
interferogram unchanged, but extinguishes the second-order interferogram. A
theoretical model that takes into consideration both the temporal and spatial
degrees-of-freedom of the two-photon state successfully explains the results.
While the temporal interference in the MZI is independent of the spatial
coherence of the source, that of the modified MZI is not.

photoemissions and photoabsorptions by quasi-free electrons within a
non-equilibrium plasma evolving from the strong coupling to the weak coupling
regime. Such transition may occur within laser-created plasmas, when the
initially created plasma is cold but the heating of the plasma by the laser
field is efficient. In particular, such a transition may occur within plasmas
created by intense VUV radiation from a FEL as indicated by the results of the
first experiments performed at the FLASH facility at DESY.
  In order to estimate the inverse bremsstrahlung cross sections, we use
point-like and effective atomic potentials. For ions modelled as point-like
charges, the total cross sections are strongly affected by the changing plasma
environment. The maximal change of the cross sections may be of the order of 60
at the change of the plasma parameters (inverse Debye length, kappa, and the
electron density, rho_e), in the range: kappa=0-3 A^{-1} and \rho_e=0.01-1
A^{-1}. These ranges correspond to the physical conditions within the plasmas
created during the first cluster experiments performed at the FLASH facility at
DESY. In contrast, for the effective atomic potentials the total cross sections
for photoemission and photoabsorption change only by a factor of 7 at most at
the same plasma parameter range.
  Our results show that the inverse bremsstrahlung cross section estimated with
the effective atomic potentials is not much affected by the plasma environment.
This observation validates the previous estimations of the enhanced heating
effect. This is important as this effect may be responsible for high energy
absorption within clusters irradiated with VUV radiation.

nebula accounts for the largest mass of Jupiter and Saturn and their largest
amount of H and He among the planets, two outstanding facts that are unsolved
puzzles in our understanding of origin of the Solar System. It is shown that
the nebula model of uniform viscosity does not match the present planet masses.
By studying current known viscosity mechanisms, I show that viscosity is more
efficient in the inner region inside Mercury and the outer region outside
Jupiter-Saturn than the intermediate region. The more efficient viscosity
drives faster radial inflow of material during the nebula evolution. Because
the inflow in the outer region is faster than the intermediate region, the
material tends to accumulate in Jupiter-Saturn region which is between the
outer and intermediate region. It is demonstrated that the gas trapping time of
Jovian planets is longer than the inflow time in the outer region. Therefore
the gas already flows to Jupiter-Saturn region before Uranus and Neptune can
capture significant gas. But the inflow in the Jupiter-Saturn region is so slow
that they can capture large amount of gas before the gas can flow further
inward. Hence they have larger masses with larger H and He content than Uranus
and Neptune. I also extend the discussion to the masses of the terrestrial
planets, especially low mass of Mercury. The advantages of this theory are
discussed.

nuclear georeactors in the core mantle boundary region (CMB) between Earths
silicate mantle and metallic core. Current geochemical models for the Earths
interior predict that U and Th in the CMB are concentrated exclusively in the
mineral calcium silicate perovskite (CaPv), leading to predicted concentration
levels of approximately 12 ppm combined U and Th, 4.5 Ga ago if CaPv is
distributed evenly throughout the CMB. Assuming a similar behaviour for
primordial 244Pu provides a considerable flux of neutrons from spontaneous
fission. We show that an additional concentration factor of only an order of
magnitude is required to both ignite and maintain self sustaining georeactors
based on fast fission. Continuously operating georeactors with a power of 5 TW
can explain the observed isotopic compositions of helium and xenon in the
Earths mantle. Our hypothesis requires the presence of elevated concentrations
of U and Th in the CMB, and is amenable to testing by direction sensitive
geoneutrino tomography.

radiation reaction as a perturbation in line with the reduction of order

order of the classical self-force. These calculations contain the emission and
forward scattering one loop processes of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum

agree completely with continuum theory. There are indications that the ghost
propagator in the infrared region is not purely color diagonal as in high
energy region. After presenting lattice simulation of configurations produced
with Kogut-Susskind fermion (MILC collaboration) and those with domain wall
fermion (RBC/UKQCD collaboration), I investigate in triple gluon vertex and the
ghost-gluon-ghost vertex how the square of the color antisymmetric ghost
contributes. Then the effect of the vertex correction to the gluon propagator
and the ghost propagator is investigated.
  Recent Dyson-Schwinger equation analysis suggests the ghost dressing function
$G(0)=$ finite and no infrared enhancement or $\alpha_G=0$. But the ghost
propagator renormalized by the loop containing a product of color antisymmetric
ghost is expected to behave as $< c\bar c>_r =-\frac{G(q^2)}{q^2}$ with
$G(q^2)\propto q^{-2(1+\alpha_G)}$ with $\alpha_G = 0.5$, if the fixed point
scenario is valid. I interpret the $\alpha_G=0$ solution should contain a
vertex correction. The infrared exponent of our lattice Landau gauge gluon
propagator of the RBC/UKQCD is $\kappa=\alpha_G=-0.5$ and that of MILC is about
-0.7.

predictions of QCD for the size of the scaling violation effects in the nucleon

momentum distributions of the point-like constituents of nucleons.
Interpretation of data coming from all these experiments and, in the case of
the SLAC experiments, even an elaboration of the running strategies, would not
have been possible without a precise understanding of the electromagnetic
radiative corrections. In this note I recollect the important milestones,
achieved in the period preceding the HERA era, in the high precision
calculations of the radiative corrections to DIS, and in the development of the
methods of their experimental control. I present subsequently the measurement
strategies and discuss the advanced radiative correction tools for the HERA

based on an extension of the Press-Schechter statistical formalism. With the
same formalism, we also obtain the mass spectrum for the non self-gravitating
clumps produced in supersonic flows. The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating
cores reproduces very well the observed initial mass function and identifies
the different mechanisms responsible for its behaviour. The theory predicts
that the shape of the IMF results from two competing contributions, namely a
power-law at large scales and an exponential cut-off (lognormal form) centered
around the characteristic mass for gravitational collapse. The cut-off exists
already in the case of pure thermal collapse, provided that the underlying
density field has a lognormal distribution. Whereas pure thermal collapse
produces a power-law tail steeper than the Salpeter value, dN/dlog M\propto
M^{-x}, with x=1.35, this latter is recovered exactly for the (3D) value of the
spectral index of the velocity power spectrum, n\simeq 3.8, found in
observations and in numerical simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence.
Indeed, the theory predicts that x=(n+1)/(2n-4) for self-gravitating structures
and x=2-n'/3 for non self-gravitating structures, where n' is the power
spectrum index of log(rho). We show that, whereas supersonic turbulence
promotes the formation of both massive stars and brown dwarfs, it has an
overall negative impact on star formation, decreasing the star formation
efficiency. This theory provides a novel theoretical foundation to understand
the origin of the IMF and to infer its behaviour in different environments. It
also provides a complementary approach and useful guidance to numerical
simulations exploring star formation, while making testable predictions.

all with measured spectroscopic redshift. Most of these sources have full
multi-wavelength coverage from the far-UV to the far-infrared and lie in the

time to characterise the spectral properties of the sources responsible for the
strong evolution observed in the MIR. Based on SED-fitting technique we have
classified the MIR sources, identifying AGN signatures in about 50% of them.
This fraction is significantly higher than that derived from optical
spectroscopy (~29%) and is due in particular to the identification of AGN
activity in objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies. It is likely that
in most of our objects, the AGN is either obscured or of low-luminosity, and
thus it does not dominate the energetic output at any wavelength, except in the
MIR, showing up just in the range where the host galaxy SED has a minimum. The
fraction of AGN strongly depends on the flux density, with that derived through
the SED-fitting being about 20% at S(15)~0.5-1 mJy and gradually increasing up
to 100% at S(15)>10 mJy, while that obtained from optical spectroscopy never
being >30%, even at the higher flux densities. The results of this work will be
very useful for updating all the models aimed at interpreting the deep infrared

(5.0+/-1.5_{stat}+/-1.6_{sys})\times 10^{-12}(E/1 TeV)^{-\alpha}
cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1} with a photon index \alpha of 2.69 +/- 0.30_{stat} +/-

Its departure point is the freedom and the responsibility given to the
different physics groups of the experiment to impose, on the {\it
event-by-event basis}, their physics-goal-optimal configurations of (i) the
sub-detectors, (ii) the trigger and data acquisition system, and (iii) the
reconstruction and analysis framework. Its target is to develop, in a close
analogy to the construction of the gauge models in particle physics, the
overall data handling scheme, in which a multi-purpose experiment becomes an
association of coexistent, yet largely independent, physics-group-based
sub-experiments sharing common hardware maintenance, data-acquisition, and data

strong, resulting in a violation of the mean field approximation T^{(2)}
\approx TT even at zero impact parameter by a factor ranging from 1.5 to O(10)
depending on the relative size of the scatterers and rapidity. This suggests
that, within the experimentally accessible energy interval, the transverse
correlation can significantly affect the nonlinear evolution of the dipole
scattering amplitude. It also suggests that the nonlinear effects may set in
earlier, already in the weak scattering regime. In the case of the simulation
with a running coupling, the violation of factorization is somewhat milder, but
still noticeable.

D-brane instantons, and study their continuity properties in moduli space as
instantons cross lines of BPS stability, potentially becoming non-BPS. We argue
that BPS instantons contributing to the superpotential cannot become non-BPS
anywhere in moduli space, since they cannot account for the required four
goldstino fermion zero modes. At most they can reach lines of threshold
stability, where they split into mutually BPS multi-instantons, as already
discussed in the literature. On the other hand, instantons with additional
fermion zero modes, contributing to multi-fermion F-terms, can indeed cross
genuine lines of marginal stability, beyond which they lead to non-BPS systems.
The non-BPS instanton generates an operator which is a D-term locally in moduli
space, but not globally. This is due to a cohomological obstruction localized
on the BPS locus, where the D-term must be written as an F-term, thus ensuring
the continuity of the 4d contribution to the effective action. We also point
out an interesting relation between lifting of fermion zero modes on instantons
and 4d supersymmetry breaking.

of the $d$-dimensional mean spherical model confined to a film geometry with

boundary conditions are applied: periodic $(p)$, antiperiodic $(a)$ and free
surfaces with Dirichlet $(D)$, Neumann $(N)$ and a combination of Neumann and
Dirichlet $(ND)$ on both surfaces. A systematic method for the evaluation of
the finite-size corrections to the free energy for the different types of
boundary conditions is proposed. The free energy density and the equation for
the spherical field are computed for arbitrary $d$. It is found, for $2<d<4$,
that the singular part of the free energy has the required finite-size scaling
form at the bulk critical temperature only for $(p)$ and $(a)$. For the
remaining boundary conditions the standard finite-size scaling hypothesis is
not valid. At $d=3$, the critical amplitude of the singular part of the free

$\Delta^{(p)}=-2\zeta(3)/(5\pi)=-0.153051...$, $\Delta^{(a)}=0.274543...$ and
$\Delta^{(ND)}=0.01922...$, implying a fluctuation--induced attraction between

model of apolar swimmers, move at low Reynold's number. In accordance with
Purcell's Scallop Theorem a single dumb-bell cannot swim because its stroke is
reciprocal in time. However the motion of two or more dumb-bells, with mutual
phase differences, is not time reversal invariant, and hence swimming is
possible. We use analytical and numerical solutions of the Stokes equations to
calculate the hydrodynamic interaction between two dumb-bell swimmers and to
discuss their relative motion. The cooperative effect of interactions between
swimmers is explored by considering first regular, and then random arrays of
dumb-bells. We find that a square array acts as a micropump. The long time
behaviour of suspensions of dumb-bells is investigated and compared to that of
model polar swimmers.

derived photometric estimates of the distribution of global metallicity [M/H]
of individual red giant stars from their V-Ks colours. We used the new data to
derive the properties of a nearly complete sample of asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars in LeoII. Using a near-infrared two-colour diagram, we were able to
obtain a clean separation from Milky Way foreground stars and discriminate
between carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We simulate the JHKs data with the
TRILEGAL population synthesis code together with the most updated thermally
pulsing AGB models, and using the star formation histories derived from
independent work based on deep HST photometry. After scaling the mass of LeoII
models to the observed number of upper RGB stars, we find that present models
predict too many O-rich TP-AGB stars of higher luminosity due to a likely
under-estimation of either their mass-loss rates at low metallicity, and/or
their degree of obscuration by circumstellar dust. On the other hand, the
TP-AGB models are able to reproduce the observed number and luminosities of
carbon stars satisfactorily well, indicating that in this galaxy the least
massive stars that became carbon stars should have masses as low as ~1 M_sun.

excitation of gases, has been identified as a significant process in the

appear to have been evaluated for CO, although the density of CO exceeds that
of CO2 in the upper atmospheres of these planets. In this paper electron
cooling rates for CO are calculated and compared with existing rates for CO2.
It is found that electron cooling by CO becomes more significant than by CO2
above altitudes of about 300 km on Mars and about 168 km on Venus. The
sensitivity of the calculated cooling rates to different measurements of the
integral cross sections for electron-impact vibrational excitation of CO is

heat capacity C(T,B) ~ -T log T is readily enhanced in low applied fields, and
exhibits a Schottky peak at 2.3 K that exhibits field dependence when T is
reduced; (2) the magnetic susceptibility diverges as T^-x at low temperatures

resistivity exhibits a T3/2 dependence over the range 1.7 < T < 24 K. No
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are discerned at T = 0.65 K for applied fields
up to 45 T. These properties, which sharply contrast those of the itinerant

compound that exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior near a quantum critical point.
