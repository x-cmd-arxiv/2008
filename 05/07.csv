clusters using 21 arcmin**2 of deep HST NICMOS, ACS, and WFPC2 image data. In
total, over this entire area, we find only one robust z~7 z-dropout candidate
(previously reported around Abell 1689). Four less robust z-dropout and
J-dropout candidates are also found. The nature of the four weaker candidates
could not be precisely determined due to the limited depth of the available
optical data, but detailed simulations suggest that all four could be
low-redshift interlopers. We compare these numbers with what we might expect
using the z~7 UV luminosity function (LF) determined from field searches. We
predict 2.7 z~7 z-dropouts and 0.3 z~9 J-dropouts over our cluster search area,
in reasonable agreement with our observational results, given the small
numbers. The number of z>~7 candidates we find in the present search are much
lower than has been reported in several previous studies of the prevalence of
z>~7 galaxies behind lensing clusters. To understand these differences, we
examined z>~7 candidates in other studies and conclude that only a small
fraction are likely to be z>~7 galaxies. Our findings support models that show
that gravitational lensing from clusters is of the most value for detecting
galaxies at magnitudes brighter than L* (H<~ 27) where the LF is expected to be
very steep. Use of these clusters to constrain the faint-end slope or determine
the full LF is likely of less value due to the shallower effective slope
measured for the LF at fainter magnitudes, as well as significant uncertainties
introduced from modelling both the gravitational lensing and incompleteness.

spatial resolution zero-order ACIS-S image of the central cluster region.
Chandra detected 42 X-ray sources on the primary CCD (ACIS-S3). All but five
have near-IR or optical counterparts and about one-fourth are variable. Notable
high-mass stellar detections are sigma Ori AB, the magnetic B star sigma Ori E,
and the B5V binary HD 37525. Most of the other detections have properties
consistent with lower mass K or M-type stars. We present the first X-ray
spectrum of the unusual infrared source IRS1 located 3.3 arc-sec north of sigma
Ori AB, which is likely an embedded T Tauri star whose disk/envelope is being
photoevaporated by sigma Ori AB. We focus on the radiative wind shock
interpretation of the soft luminous X-ray emission from sigma Ori AB, but also
consider possible alternatives including magnetically-confined wind shocks and
colliding wind shocks. Its emission lines show no significant asymmetries or
centroid shifts and are moderately broadened to HWHM ~ 264 km/s, or one-fourth
the terminal wind speed. Forbidden lines in He-like ions are formally
undetected, implying strong UV suppression. The Mg XI triplet forms in the wind
acceleration zone within one stellar radius above the surface. These X-ray
properties are consistent in several respects with the predictions of radiative
wind shock theory for an optically thin wind, but explaining the narrow line
widths presents a challenge to the theory.

Nonlinearities exasperate the situation somewhat, in that solutions may form

none of the available functionals is able to provide, at the same time,
accurate electronic and structural properties of the cubic and tetragonal
phases of BaTiO$_3$ and PbTiO$_3$. Some, although not all, usual DFT
functionals predict the structure with acceptable accuracy, but always
underestimate the electronic band gaps. Conversely, common hybrid functionals
yield an improved description of the band gaps, but overestimate the volume and
atomic distortions associated to ferroelectricity, giving rise to an
unacceptably large $c/a$ ratio for the tetragonal phases of both compounds.
This super-tetragonality is found to be induced mainly by the exchange energy
corresponding to the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and, to a lesser
extent, by the exact exchange term of the hybrid functional. We thus propose an
alternative functional that mixes exact exchange with the recently proposed GGA
of Wu and Cohen [Phys. Rev. B 73, 235116 (2006)] which, for solids, improves
over the treatment of exchange of the most usual GGA's. The new functional
renders an accurate description of both the structural and electronic

identities, and the generating functions characterize and count amplitudes in
the MHV and NMHV sectors. The MHV generating function provides an efficient way
to perform the intermediate state helicity sums required to obtain loop

expansion obtained from recursion relations associated with a 3-line shift of
external momenta involving a reference spinor |X]. The recursion relations
remain valid for a subset of N=8 supergravity amplitudes which do not vanish
asymptotically for all |X]. The MHV-vertex expansion of the n-graviton NMHV

models in terms of the epoch at which the oscillation frequency exceeds the
expansion rate, which is effectively the time at which rapid oscillations
begin. There are three basic types of behavior: early oscillation models, in
which oscillations begin during the matter-dominated era, late oscillation
models, in which oscillations begin after scalar-field domination, and
non-oscillating models. We examine a representative set of models (those with
power-law potentials) and determine the parameter range giving acceptable
agreement with the supernova observations. We show that a subset of all three

enhanced mass-loss, or outburst. The cause of these outbursts has thus far been
a mystery. One explanation is that they are initiated by kappa-effect
pulsations in the atmosphere caused by an increase in luminosity at
temperatures near the so-called ``iron bump'' (T ~ 200,000 K), where the Fe
opacity suddenly increases. Due to a lag in the onset of convection, this
luminosity can build until it exceeds the Eddington limit locally, seeding
pulsations and possibly driving some mass from the star. We present some
preliminary results from a parameter study focusing on the conditions necessary
to trigger normal S-Dor type (as opposed to extreme eta-Car type) outbursts. We
find that as Y increases or Z decreases, the pulsational amplitude decreases

interaction dynamics of a single atom strongly coupled to the resonator mode
for several hundred milliseconds by observing the cavity transmission.
Moreover, we investigate the position-dependent coupling of one and two atoms
by shuttling them through the cavity mode. We demonstrate an alternative
method, which suppresses heating effects, to analyze the atom-field interaction
by retrieving the atom from the cavity and by measuring its final state.

order to have their ad shown next to search results for specific keywords.
Currently, the most popular auction for sponsored search is the ""Generalized
Second Price"" (GSP) auction in which advertisers are assigned to slots in the
decreasing order of their ""score,"" which is defined as the product of their bid
and click-through rate. In the past few years, there has been significant
research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser's interaction
with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this
ranking order has remained standard.
  From a search engine's perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the
best assignment of advertisers to slots? Here ""best"" could mean ""maximizing
user satisfaction,"" ""most efficient,"" ""revenue-maximizing,"" ""simplest to
interact with,"" or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to
understand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed
ads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its
value. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on
an ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.
  We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption.
We then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under
this model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP. A truthful
auction then follows from an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism. Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable
properties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive. At the technical core of our
result are a number of insights about the structure of the optimal assignment.

understanding of the behaviour of light. In recent years we have seen negative
refraction, focusing of light by a flat slab, a ``perfect'' prism, and an
``invisibility cloak'' [1-6]. It is generally understood that the cause of this
unusual behaviour is the strong (anomalous) dispersion, i.e., dependence of the
material properties on the frequency of light. Dispersion can be either due to
a natural microscopic resonance of the material as with surface
plasmons-polaritons, or due to an effective resonance (band-gap) of the
periodic lattice as in photonics [7-9]. Metamaterials take the better of the
two approaches representing a periodic array of designer subwavelength
particles tuned to resonate at a specific frequency-band. At present, however,
we have only a very basic understanding of the effect which a finite size of a
sample of a periodic photonic crystal or metamaterial has on the macroscopic
properties such as refraction. Yet every finite dielectric object is a
moderate-quality resonator whose eigenmodes form a virtual photonic lattice
with its own angular band-gaps and preferred directions of propagation. Here we
show that this virtual lattice produces nontrivial real effects and that even a
homogeneous dielectric resonator may refract negatively without either negative
or periodically modulated permittivity/permeability. We also propose a simple
way to control the period of this virtual photonic lattice by varying the
transverse dimension of the resonator. Our research shows the importance of
three-dimensional resonant phenomena in optics and may result in new optical
devices with unusual properties.

The H2O level populations and emission profiles are in turn computed with a
non-LTE line code. The results are analyzed to determine the diagnostic value
of different lines, and are compared with existing observations. Lines can be
categorized in: (i) optically thick lines, including ground-state lines, mostly
sensitive to the cold outer part; (ii) highly excited (E_u>200-250 K) optically
thin lines sensitive to the abundance in the hot inner part; and (iii) lines
which vary from optically thick to thin depending on the abundances. Dust
influences the emission of water significantly by becoming optically thick at
the higher frequencies, and by pumping optically thin lines. A good physical
model of a source, including a correct treatment of dust, is a prerequisite to
infer the water abundance structure and possible jumps at the evaporation
temperature from observations. The inner warm (T>100 K) envelope can be probed
byhighly-excited lines, while a combination of excited and spectrally resolved
ground state lines probes the outer envelope. Observations of H218O lines,

Chain Monte Carlo techniques in SU(3) lattice gauge theory. We find that the

long-wavelength limit. This is due to formation of competing Z(3) domains for
configurations where the Polyakov loop exhibits non-perturbatively large
variations in space, which delay thermalization of long wavelength modes. For
realistic temperatures, and away from the extreme weak-coupling limit, we find
that even modes with $k$ on the order of $T$ experience delayed thermalization.
Relaxation times of very long wavelength modes are found to be on the order of

was presented by Charbonneau and collaborators in 2002. In the optical
transmission spectrum of the transiting exoplanet HD209458b, an absorption
signal from sodium was measured at a level of 0.023+-0.006%, using the STIS
spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Despite several attempts, so far
only upper limits to the Na D absorption have been obtained using telescopes
from the ground, and the HST result has yet to be confirmed.
  [Aims] The aims of this paper are to re-analyse data taken with the High
Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope, to correct for systematic
effects dominating the data quality, and to improve on previous results
presented in the literature.
  [Methods] The data reduction process was altered in several places, most
importantly allowing for small shifts in the wavelength solution. The relative
depth of all lines in the spectra, including the two sodium D lines, are found
to correlate strongly with the continuum count level in the spectra. These
variations are attributed to non-linearity effects in the CCDs. After removal
of this empirical relation the uncertainties in the line depths are only a
fraction above that expected from photon statistics.
  [Results] The sodium absorption due to the planet's atmosphere is detected at
>5 sigma, at a level of 0.056+-0.007% (2x3.0 Ang band), 0.070+-0.011% (2x1.5
Ang band), and 0.135+-0.017% (2x0.75 Ang band). There is no evidence that the
planetary absorption signal is shifted with respect to the stellar absorption,
as recently claimed for HD189733b. The measurements in the two most narrow
bands indicate that some signal is being resolved.[abridged]

estimate redshifts and stellar ages. The SEDs are compared with models of
galactic chemical evolution to determine the stellar mass, and to characterize
the age distribution. We find that, (1) the average age of late-type bulges in
our sample is ~1.3 Gyr with stellar masses in the range log(M)=6.5-10 solar.
(2) Late-type bulges are younger than early-type galaxies at similar redshifts
and lack a trend of age with respect to redshift, suggesting a more extended
period of star formation. (3) Bulges and inner disks in these late-type
galaxies show similar stellar populations, and (4) late-type bulges are better
fitted by exponential surface brightness profiles. The overall picture emerging
from the GRAPES data is that, in late-type galaxies at z=1, bulges form through

compare them with global gravitational collapse timescales. We identify

given instability will dominate. We find that dynamical instabilities disrupt
large-scale coherent flows via generation of turbulence, while strong thermal
fragmentation amplifies the resulting low-amplitude density perturbations, thus
leading to small-scale, high-density fragments as seeds for {\em local} gravity
to act upon. Global gravity dominates only on the largest scales; large-scale
gravitationally-driven flows promote the formation of groups and clusters of

consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new
metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the
unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the
Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a
distribution than the Shannon entropy. Next, we analyze the propagation speed
of network-aware malwares in view of information theory. In particular, we draw
a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic malware-scanning
algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are
characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a
non-unform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning
algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can
increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when
compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation.
This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the
early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a
network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of
defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our results
demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares is a significant

poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanofluidic chip. The extensions of the DNA molecules
were measured with fluorescence microscopy as a function of the ionic strength
and composition of the buffer as well as the DNA intercalation level by the
YOYO-1 dye. The data were interpreted with scaling theory for a wormlike
polymer in good solvent, including the effects of confinement, charge, and
self-avoidance. It was found that the elongation of the DNA molecules with
decreasing ionic strength can be interpreted in terms of an increase of the
persistence length. Self-avoidance effects on the extension are moderate, due
to the small correlation length imposed by the channel cross-sectional
diameter. Intercalation of the dye results in an increase of the DNA contour
length and a partial neutralization of the DNA charge, but besides effects of
electrostatic origin it has no significant effect on the bare bending rigidity.
In the presence of divalent cations, the DNA molecules were observed to
contract, but they do not collapse into a condensed structure. It is proposed
that this contraction results from a divalent counterion mediated attractive
force between the segments of the DNA molecule.

Velocities with an accuracy of ~10 kms-1 were obtained for 4105 stars selected
to lie in the vicinity of the lower giant branch in the cluster
colour-magnitude diagram and which cover an area on the sky of ~2.4x3.9 deg2
centered on the cluster. Within the velocity interval 190-270 kms-1, the
cluster member candidates have a steeply declining surface density distribution
consistent with the adopted tidal radius of 57`. For stars in the sample beyond
the tidal radius, an analysis of line-strengths from the spectra, as well as
radial velocities, identifies only six stars as possible candidates for
extra-tidal association with the cluster. If all six of these stars are indeed
related to the cluster, then a maximum of 0.7 +/- 0.2 per cent of the total
cluster mass is contained in the region between one and two tidal radii. Given
this limit, we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for any
significant extra-tidal population in omega Cen. The effects of tidal shocks on
the outer parts of the cluster are consistent with this limit. Theories for the
origin of omega Cen frequently suggest that the cluster is the former nucleus
of a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy. Our results require that the stripping
process must have been largely complete at early epochs, consistent with
dynamical models of the process. The stripped former dwarf galaxy stars are
therefore now widely distributed around the Galaxy.

massless scalar fields, in addition to closed-string massless moduli fields
corresponding to the compactification. It is interesting to focus on the fate
of such scalar fields in models with broken supersymmetry, because no symmetry
forbids their masses. The one-loop effect may give non-zero masses to them, and
in some cases mass squared may become negative, which means the radiative gauge
symmetry breaking. In this article we investigate and propose a simple method
for calculating the one-loop corrections using the boundary state formalism.
There are two categories of massless open-string scalar fields. One consists
the gauge potential fields corresponding to compactified directions, which can
be understood as scalar fields in uncompactified space-time (related with
Wilson line degrees of freedom). The other consists ""gauge potential fields""
corresponding to transverse directions of D-brane, which emerge as scalar
fields in D-brane world-volume (related with brane moduli fields). The D-brane
boundary states with constant backgrounds of these scalar fields are
constructed, and one-loop scalar masses are calculated in the closed string
picture. Explicit calculations are given in the following four concrete models:
one D25-brane with a circle compactification in bosonic string theory, one
D9-brane with a circle compactification in superstring theory, D3-branes at a
supersymmetric C^3/Z_3 orbifold singularity, and a model of brane supersymmetry
breaking with D3-branes and anti-D7-branes at a supersymmetric C^3/Z_3 orbifold
singularity. We show that the sign of the mass squared has a strong correlation
with the sign of the related open-string one-loop vacuum amplitude.

deconvolution of the point spread function as well as calibration of
instrumental and atmospheric effects. In general, such effects are
time-variable and vary across the field of view as well, resulting in
direction-dependent (DD), time-varying gains. Most existing imaging and
calibration algorithms assume that the corruptions are direction independent,
preventing even moderate dynamic range full-beam, full-Stokes imaging. We
present a general framework for imaging algorithms which incorporate DD errors.
We describe as well an iterative deconvolution algorithm that corrects known DD
errors due to the antenna power patterns and pointing errors for high dynamic
range full-beam polarimetric imaging. Using simulations we demonstrate that
errors due to realistic primary beams as well as antenna pointing errors will
limit the dynamic range of upcoming higher sensitivity instruments and that our
new algorithm can be used to correct for such errors. We have applied this
algorithm to VLA 1.4 GHz observations of a field that contains two ``4C''
sources and have obtained Stokes-I and -V images with systematic errors that
are one order of magnitude lower than those obtained with conventional imaging
tools. Our simulations show that on data with no other calibration errors, the
algorithm corrects pointing errors as well as errors due to known asymmetries
in the antenna pattern.

basic assumptions: The assumption of the allosteric transition of a KaiC
hexamer and the assumption of the monomer exchange between KaiC hexamers. The
model shows a stable rhythmic oscillation of the phosphorylation level of KaiC,
which is robust against changes in concentration of Kai proteins. We show that
this robustness gives a clue to distinguish different possible mechanisms. We
also discuss the robustness of oscillation against the change in the system

developed an approximation for the ellipsoidal collapse model and applied it to
the calculation of the conditional mass function and the halo formation time
distribution. For models in which the steps are positively correlated, the halo
merger rate is enhanced when the accreted mass is less than $\sim 25M^*$, while
for the negatively correlated case this rate is reduced. Compared with the
standard model in which the steps are uncorrelated, the models with positively
correlated steps produce more aged population in small mass halos and more
younger population in large mass halos, while for the models with negatively
correlated steps the opposite is true. An examination of simulation results
shows that a weakly positive correlation between successive merging steps
appears to fit best. We have also found a systematic effect in the measured

diagrammatic presentation of definable strategies by the means of generators
and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of

temperatures, phase difference as well as junction parameters. We find that
proximity effect may lead to a substantial deviation of the specific heat as
compared to that in the normal state, and that it can be largely tuned in
magnitude by changing the phase difference between the superconductors. A
measurement setup to confirm these predictions is also suggested.

lower power consumption of electronic devices, make miniaturized renewable

alternatives, an interesting option is the use of inertial microgenerators for
energy scavenging from vibrations present in the environment. These devices
constitute perpetual energy sources without the need for refilling, thus being
well suited for abandoned sensors, wireless systems or microsystems which must
be embedded within the structure, without outside physical connections.
Different electromagnetic energy scavenging devices have been described in the
literature [1,2,3], based on the use of a velocity damped resonator, which is
well suited for harvesting of vibrational energy induced by the operation of
machines. These vibrations are characterized by a well defined frequency (in
the range between few Hz's and few kHz's) and low displacement amplitudes.
Adjusting the resonant frequency of the system to that of the vibrations allows
amplification of these low amplitude displacements. Moreover, for these
applications, the use of an electromagnetic device has the potential advantages
of a good level of compatibility with Si Microsystem technology, as well as the
possibility of relatively high electromechanical coupling with simple designs.

Here we use the 69 GRB dataset recently compiled by Schaefer (astro-ph/0612285)
and we test the calibration of five of the above correlations
($1:\epkk-E_\gamma$, $2:\epkk-L$, $3:\tlag-L$, $4:V-L$, $5:\trt-L$) with
respect to two potential sources of systematics: Evolution with redshift and
cosmological model used in the calibration. In examining the model dependence
we assume flat \lcdm and vary $\omm$. Our approach avoids the circularity
problem of previous studies since we do not fix $\omm$ to find the correlation
parameters. Instead we simultaneously minimize $\chi^2$ with respect to both
the log-linear correlation parameters $a$, $b$ and the cosmological parameter
$\omm$. We find no statistically significant evidence for redshift dependence
of $a$ and $b$ in any of the correlation relations tested. We also find that
one of the five correlation relations tested ($\epkk-E_\gamma$) has a
significantly lower intrinsic dispersion compared to the other correlations.
For this correlation relation, the maximum likelihood method favors the
existence of a cosmological constant while the other four correlation favor a
flat matter dominated universe $\omm \simeq 1$. Finally, a cross-correlation
analysis between the GRBs and SnIa data for various values of $\omm$ has shown
that the $E_{peak}-E_\gamma$ relation traces well the SnIa redshift regime.
However, even the tightest correlation relation ($E_{peak}-E_\gamma$) provides
much weaker constraints on $\omm$ than current SnIa data.

the energy accumulation in the charge pump and the recharge of the buffer

efficiency of the energy harvesting. In previous papers [1] the switch
commutates periodically with some fixed duty ratio. However, this solution is

between driven and weakly damped modes play a key role in determining which

forcing functions that produce examples of superlattice patterns and
quasipatterns in a new model PDE with parametric forcing. We make quantitative
comparisons between the predicted patterns and the solutions of the PDE.
Unexpectedly, the agreement is good only for parameter values very close to

requires strong damping of all modes apart from the driven pattern-forming
modes. This is in conflict with the requirement for weak damping if three-wave
coupling is to influence pattern selection effectively. We distinguish the two
different ways that three-wave interactions can be used to stabilise
quasipatterns, and present examples of 12-, 14- and 20-fold approximate
quasipatterns. We identify which computational domains provide the most

Geometrical onlinearity caused by mechanical coupling between axial and
flexural behaviour is detected and modelled. Experimental results demonstrate a
good agreement between FEM approaches proposed and tests. A fairly fast and
accurate prediction of pull-in condition is performed, thus numerical models
can be used to identify residual stress in microbridges by reverse analysis

changes as a function of the hydrodynamic pressure within the nip as a result

adds more complexity to the flow due to the force equilibrium in the fluid gas

This technology also offers the possibility to build up systems with high

steps will be described, as well as appropriate handling concepts. Three main
concepts for 3D integration have been developed at IZM. The approach with the
greatest flexibility called Inter Chip Via - Solid Liquid Interdiffusion
(ICV-SLID) is introduced. This is a chip-to-wafer stacking technology which
combines the advantages of the Inter Chip Via (ICV) process and the
solid-liquid-interdiffusion technique (SLID) of copper and tin. The fully
modular ICV-SLID concept allows the formation of multiple device stacks. A test
chip was designed and the total process sequence of the ICV-SLID technology for
the realization of a three-layer chip-to-wafer stack was demonstrated. The
proposed wafer-level 3D integration concept has the potential for low cost
fabrication of multi-layer high-performance 3D-SoCs and is well suited as a
replacement for embedded technologies based on monolithic integration. To
address yield issues a wafer-level chip-scale handling is presented as well, to
select known-good dies and work on them with wafer-level process sequences
before joining them to integrated stacks.

DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching) to etch through-silicon via (TSV) for advanced

manufacturing, each requiring different etch process performances. A review of
the DRIE capability in terms of etching profile, etch rate, etch depth has been
carried out. Excellent tool flexibility allows a wide range of basic and
complex profiles to be achieved. Unlike other techniques, DRIE has the
capability to etch feature sizes ranging from sub-micron to millimeter width.
The main specificity of the DRIE is that etch rate is sensitive to the total
exposed area and the aspect ratio. For the TSV applications, where the total
exposed area is lower than 10%, high etch rates are achievable. A study has
also been done to highlight the importance of via profile for the success of
the refilling step. In addition, due to the high flexibility of DRIE, we also

depositing a 5 nm SiO2 followed by annealing, whereas a tensile stress (~ 0.7

and temperature effect, have already exploited [1-3]. Each energy source should
be used in suitable environment, therefore to produce maximum efficiency. In
this paper, we present an acoustic wave actuated micro-generator for power
system by using the energy of acoustic waves, such as the sound from human
voices or speakerphone, to actuate a MEMS-type electromagnetic transducer. This
provides a longer device lifetime and greater power system convenience.
Moreover, it is convenient to integrate MEMS-based microgenerators with small

a multi-physics approach. Electro-magnetic fields within a novel open ended

applications are solved using a de icated Yee scheme finite-difference

whilst the microwave cavity - encompassing the polymer load - was meshed for
microwave irradiation. The two solution domains are linked using a
cross-mapping routine. The principle of heating using the evanescent fringing
fields within the open-end of the cavity is demonstrated. A closed loop
feedback routine is established allowing the temperature within a lossy sample

This paper gives a thorough overview of data analysis issues for the best
diagnostics of Fe XII and Fe XIII and assesses the accuracy of the
measurements. Two density diagnostics each from Fe XII (186.88/195.12 and
196.64/195.12) and Fe XIII (196.54/202.04 and 203.82/202.04) are analysed in
two active region data-sets from 2007 May 3 and 6 that yield densities in the
range 8.5 < log N_e < 11.0. The densities are derived using v5.2 of the CHIANTI
atomic database. The Fe XII and Fe XIII diagnostics show broadly the same trend
in density across the active region, consistent with their similar temperatures
of formation. However the high precision of the EIS measurements demonstrates
significant discrepancies of up to 0.5 dex in derived log N_e values, with Fe
XII always giving higher densities than Fe XIII. The discrepancies may partly
be due to real physical differences between the emitting regions of the two
plasmas, but the dominant factor lies in the atomic models of the two ions. Two
specific problems are identified for Fe XII 196.64 and Fe XIII 203.82: the
former is found to be under-estimated in strength by the CHIANTI atomic model,
while the high density limit of the 203.82/202.04 is suggested to be inaccurate
in the CHIANTI atomic model. The small grating tilt of the EIS instrument is
found to be very significant when deriving densities from emission lines
separated by more than a few angstroms.

present different coefficients and dispersion for their Kormendy relation (KR).
A recently published paper states that the intrinsic dispersion of the KR
depends on the magnitude range within which the galaxies are contained,
therefore, we investigate here whether the magnitude range has also an
influence over the values of the coefficients of the KR; $\alpha$ (zero point)
and $\beta$ (slope). We perform numerical simulations and analysis of these
coefficients for 4 samples of galaxies, which contain an approximate total of
9400 ETGs in a relatively ample magnitude range ($<\Delta M>$ $\sim 6 mag$).
  The analysis of the results makes us conclude that the values of the KR
coefficients depend on the width of the magnitude range and the brightness of
galaxies within the magnitude range. This dependence is due to the fact that
the distribution of galaxies in the $\log (r_{e}) - <\mu>_{e}$ plane depends on
luminosity and that this distribution is not symmetrical, that is, the
geometric shape of the distribution of galaxies in the $\log (r_{e}) -
<\mu>_{e}$ plane plays an important role in the determination of the values of
the coefficients of the KR.

belonging to different standards) by introducing an iterated non-cooperative
game. Users start out completely uneducated and naive but, by using a fixed set
of strategies to process a broadcasted training signal, they quickly evolve and
converge to an evolutionarily stable equilibrium. Then, in order to measure
efficiency in this steady state, we adapt the notion of the price of anarchy to
our setting and we obtain an explicit analytic estimate for it by using methods
from statistical physics (namely the theory of replicas). Surprisingly, we find
that the price of anarchy does not depend on the specifics of the wireless
nodes (e.g. spectral efficiency) but only on the number of strategies per user
and a particular combination of the number of nodes, the number of users and
the size of the training signal. Finally, we map this game to the well-studied
minority game, generalizing its analysis to an arbitrary number of choices.

collisions poses two basic problems: (1) why do even elementary collisions with

2) why is there in such interactions a suppression of strange particle
production? We show that the recently proposed mechanism of thermal hadron
production through Hawking-Unruh radiation can naturally account for both. The
event horizon of colour confinement leads to thermal behaviour, but the
resulting temperature depends on the strange quark content of the produced
hadrons, causing a deviation from full equilibrium and hence a suppression of
strange particle production. We apply the resulting formalism to multihadron
production in e+e- annihilation over a wide energy range and make a
comprehensive analysis of the data in the conventional statistical
hadronization model and the modified Hawking-Unruh formulation. We show that
this formulation provides a very good description of the measured hadronic
abundances, fully determined in terms of the string tension and the bare
strange quark mass; it contains no adjustable parameters.

scaling behavior: i.e., the logarithm of the decay rate should scale as a power
of the distance to a bifurcation point where the metastable state disappears.
Recently such behavior was observed and some of the earlier predicted exponents
were found in experiments on several types of systems described by a model of a
modulated oscillator. Here we establish the range where different scaling
behavior is displayed and show how the crossover between different types of
scaling occurs. The analysis is done for a nonlinear oscillator with two
coexisting stable states of forced vibrations. Our numerical calculations,
based on the the instanton method allow the mapping of the entire parameter
range of bi-stability. We find the regions where the scaling exponents are 1 or
3/2, depending on the damping. The exponent 3/2 is found to extend much further

model, in which the inflaton potentials are of exponential type and a waterfall
field that terminates inflation has the standard quartic potential with two
minima. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive an expression for the
curvature perturbation valid to full nonlinear order. Then we give an explicit
expression for the curvature perturbation to second order in the inflaton
perturbation. We find that the final form of the curvature perturbation depends
crucially on how the inflation ends. Using this expression, we present closed
analytical expressions for the spectrum of the curvature perturbation ${\cal

non-Gaussian parameter $f_{NL}^{\rm local}$, in terms of the model parameters.
We find that a wide range of the parameter space $(n_S, r, f_{NL}^{\rm local})$
can be covered by varying the model parameters within a physically reasonable
range. In particular, for plausible values of the model parameters, we may have
large non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{\rm local}\sim 10$--100. This is in sharp
contrast to the case of single-field hybrid inflation in which these parameters
are tightly constrained.

systematically higher uncertainties than kinematical ones, especially for
galaxies with low inclination. Morphological inclination of galaxies having no
robust determination of their morphological position angle cannot be
constrained correctly. Galaxies with high inclination show a better agreement
between their kinematical inclination and their morphological inclination

enhancement and an almost 30-fold increase in decay rate from arrays of Ag

situated fluorophore. This is consistent with a greatly increased efficiency
for energy transfer from fluorescence to surface plasmons. Additionally,
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements show a maximum

truncating a consistent solution to the type IIB supergravity equations of
motion (top-down). This model demonstrates dynamical chiral symmetry breaking,
has a running coupling and contains a holographic description of the vector
meson sector. By artificially extending the existing U(1) symmetry to SU(2)
(bottom-up) we then obtain a holographic description of the axial vector
sector. We show that this model reproduces the masses and decay constants of
the lightest mesons to the 10% level. By regulating the UV with a sharp cut-off
we can reproduce the rho meson masses to within 2%. Finally we demonstrate that
this model can be used to reproduce a very good agreement with hadronization
data for particle production over a range of four orders of magnitude.

effect to produce attractive force between the gluons within the glueball. We
also study the confining force between the quarks within the baryon via strings
that hang into the dipole deformed AdS geometry and see that the dipole could
also produce an attractive force between the quarks. In particular, we find

Gaussian laws may produce a potential with multiple deep wells. We study in the
present work fine properties of mixtures with respect to concentration of
measure and Sobolev type functional inequalities. We provide sharp Laplace
bounds for Lipschitz functions in the case of generic mixtures, involving a
transportation cost diameter of the mixed family. Additionally, our analysis of
Sobolev type inequalities for two-component mixtures reveals natural relations
with some kind of band isoperimetry and support constrained interpolation via
mass transportation. We show that the Poincar\'e constant of a two-component
mixture may remain bounded as the mixture proportion goes to 0 or 1 while the
logarithmic Sobolev constant may surprisingly blow up. This counter-intuitive
result is not reducible to support disconnections, and appears as a
reminiscence of the variance-entropy comparison on the two-point space. As far
as mixtures are concerned, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is less stable
than the Poincar\'e inequality and the sub-Gaussian concentration for Lipschitz
functions. We illustrate our results on a gallery of concrete two-component
mixtures. This work leads to many open questions.

Today, QCD calculations predict the lightest glueball to be a scalar state with

experimental evidence. In a re-analysis of the phase shifts for pi pi
scattering up to 1800 MeV where such states should show up we find the broad

f_0(980) and f_0(1500) but no evidence for f_0(1370). Phenomenological
arguments for the broad state to be a glueball are recalled. It is argued that
the large radiative width of f_0(600)/\sigma reported recently is not in

small ``direct'' radiative component is consistent with QCD sum rule
