been determined using both ground and space-based imaging. These measurements
require long baselines and repeat observations and typical errors are of order
ten milli-arcseconds per century. In this paper, we utilize the effect of
""perspective rotation"" to show that systematic proper motion of some dSphs can
be determined to a similar precision using only stellar line-of-sight
velocities. We show that including the effects of small intrinsic rotation in
dSphs increases the proper motion errors by about a factor of two. We provide
error projections for future data sets, and show that proposed thirty meter
class telescopes will measure the proper motion of a few dSphs with
milli-arcsecond per century precision.

the underlying fundamental theory (e.g. the ground state-hydrogen atom in a
suitable QED with electrons and protons) in the non-accelerated case. As a
concrete example, we study a local relativistic field theory where a stable
particle can capture a light quantum and form a quasi-stable state. As
expected, to such a stable particle correspond energy eigenstates of the full

order in perturbation theory. We derive an effective model of detector (at

to the two internal levels, ""ground"" and ""excited"", of the detector.

rarely in BL Lacs, most probably due to their orientation close to the line of
sight and the ensuing foreshortening effects. Only three BL Lacs are known so
far to contain a kpc-scale X-ray jet. In this paper, we present the evidence
for the existence of a fourth extended X-ray jet in the classical
radio-selected source S5 2007+777, which for its hybrid FRI/II radio morphology
has been classified as a HYMOR (HYbrid MOrphology Radio source). Our Chandra
ACIS-S observations of this source revealed an X-ray counterpart to the
19""-long radio jet. Interestingly, the X-ray properties of the kpc-scale jet in
S5 2007+777 are very similar to those observed in FRII jets. First, the X-ray
morphology closely mirrors the radio one, with the X-rays being concentrated in
the discrete radio knots. Second, the X-ray continuum of the jet/brightest knot
is described by a very hard power law, with photon index Gamma_x~1, although
the uncertainties are large. Third, the optical upper limit from archival HST
data implies a concave radio-to-X-ray SED. If the X-ray emission is attributed
to IC/CMB with equipartition, strong beaming (delta=13) is required, implying a
very large scale (Mpc) jet. The beaming requirement can be somewhat relaxed
assuming a magnetic field lower than equipartition. Alternatively, synchrotron
emission from a second population of very high-energy electrons is viable.
Comparison to other HYMOR jets detected with Chandra is discussed, as well as
general implications for the origin of the FRI/II division.

ground states of the model for interactions which interpolate between the
limits of pure superexchange and purely direct exchange interactions. By
considering ordered and dimerized states at the mean--field level, and by
interpreting the results from exact diagonalization calculations on selected
finite systems, we demonstrate that orbital interactions are always frustrated,
and that orbital correlations are dictated by the spin state, manifesting an
intrinsic entanglement of these degrees of freedom. In the absence of Hund
coupling, the ground state changes from a highly resonating, dimer--based,
symmetry--restored spin and orbital liquid phase, to one based on completely
static, spin--singlet valence bonds. The generic properties of frustration and
entanglement survive even when spins and orbitals are nominally decoupled in
the ferromagnetic phases stabilized by a strong Hund coupling. By considering
the same model on other lattices, we discuss the extent to which frustration is
attributable separately to geometry and to interaction effects.

phase-separating fluid, we restrict our attention to films that do not rupture.
To do this, we introduce a regularising Van der Waals potential. We analyse the
resulting fourth-order equations by constructing a solution as the limit of a
Galerkin approximation, and obtain existence and regularity results. In our
analysis, we find a nonzero lower bound for the height of the film, which
precludes the possibility of rupture. The lower bound depends on the parameters
of the problem, and we compare this dependence with numerical simulations. We
find that while the theoretical lower bound is crucial to the construction of a
smooth, unique solution to the PDEs, it is not sufficiently sharp to represent
accurately the parametric dependence of the observed dips in free-surface

measurements, and multi-band photometric observations. We find that 310 of the
stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. Their
distribution of rotation periods span more than two orders of magnitude from
~0.1-15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the time-span of
the survey. With an age between the zero-age main-sequence and the Hyades, and
with ~6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit
detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80%
of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color-period plane,
defining clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The
M35 color-period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition
between the two rotational states for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These
timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and
offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum
transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades,
confirm the Skumanich (1972) spindown-dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational
state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the
rotational sequences in the M35 color-period diagram support the use of
rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use
such gyrochronology to determine ""gyro-ages"" for M35. We use the M35 data to
evaluate new color dependencies for the rotational isochrones.

models is the emission of photons over a broad energy band resulting from the

cosmic microwave background photons of energetic electrons and positrons
produced in dark matter annihilation is expected to produce significant diffuse
X-ray emission. Dwarf galaxies are ideal targets for this type of dark matter
search technique, being nearby, dark matter dominated systems free of any
astrophysical diffuse X-ray background. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of X-ray observations of local dwarf galaxies aimed at the
search for WIMP dark matter. We outline the optimal energy and angular ranges
for current telescopes, and analyze the systematic uncertainties connected to
electron/positron diffusion. We do not observe any significant X-ray excess,
and translate this null result into limits on the mass and pair annihilation
cross section for particle dark matter. Our results indicate that X-ray
observations of dwarf galaxies currently constrain dark matter models at the
same level or even more strongly than gamma-ray observations of the same
systems, although at the expenses of introducing additional assumptions and
related uncertainties in the modeling of diffusion and energy loss processes.
The limits we find constrain portions of the supersymmetric parameter space,

X-ray (HXR) footpoints (FPs) observed with RHESSI in the 2003 October 29 X10
flare. The double FPs first move toward and then away from each other, mainly
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic neutral line, respectively. The
transition of these two phases of FP unshearing motions coincides with the
direction reversal of the motion of the loop-top (LT) source, and with the
minima of the estimated loop length and LT height. The FPs show temporal
correlations between HXR flux, spectral index, and magnetic field strength. The
HXR flux exponentially correlates with the magnetic field strength, which also
anti-correlates with the spectral index before the second HXR peak's maximum,
suggesting that particle acceleration sensitively depends on the magnetic field
strength and/or reconnection rate. Asymmetries are observed between the FPs: on
average, the eastern FP is 2.2 times brighter in HXR flux and 1.8 times weaker
in magnetic field strength, and moves 2.8 times faster away from the neutral
line than the western FP; the estimated coronal column density to the eastern
FP from the LT source is 1.7 times smaller. The two FPs have marginally
different spectral indexes. The eastern-to-western FP HXR flux ratio and
magnetic field strength ratio are anti-correlated only before the second HXR
peak's maximum. Neither magnetic mirroring nor column density alone can explain
the totality of these observations, but their combination, together with other
transport effects, might provide a full explanation. We have also developed
novel techniques to remove particle contamination from HXR counts and to
estimate effects of pulse pileup in imaging spectroscopy, which can be applied
to other RHESSI flares in similar circumstances.

the LCDM paradigm. Solving this puzzle now requires not only matching the
numbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formation
histories. We present a summary of such histories derived from the HST data
using the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. To reduce observational
uncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters -- the
fractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 Gyr, and the mean
stellar age. We interpret the new data with a phenomenological model based on
the mass assembly histories of dark matter halos and the Schmidt law of star
formation. The model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfs
and the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 Gyr. However, in order
to be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amount
of recent star formation in the last 2 Gyr. Within the framework of our model,
this prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variation
in the density threshold of the star formation law. The model results are not
sensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the Schmidt law, or the details
of cosmic reionization. A few discrepancies still remain: our model typically
predicts too large stellar masses, only a modest population of ultra-faint
dwarfs, and a small number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellar
populations. Nevertheless, the observed star formation histories of Local Group
dwarfs are generally consistent the expected star formation in cold dark matter
halos.

discover a slowly rotating (in projected velocity) L dwarf that allows more
accurate measurement of spectroscopic rotations for these objects. We measure
chromospheric activity (and often its variability) through the H$\alpha$
emission line. Our primary new result is good evidence that magnetic braking
dominates the angular momentum evolution of even brown dwarfs, although
spindown times appear to increase as mass decreases. We confirm that activity
decreases as effective temperature decreases, though a larger fraction of L
dwarfs are active than has previously been reported. Essentially all active
objects are also variable. We confirm the lack of a rotation-activity
connection for L dwarfs. We find a minimum limit for rotational velocities that
increases with later spectral types, rising from near zero in older mid-M stars
to more than 20 km s$^{-1}$ for mid-L objects. There is strong evidence that
all L dwarfs are rapid rotators. We derive a braking law that can depend on
either temperature or mass which can explain all the rotational results and
provides an age dependence for the angular momentum evolution. It is clear that
angular momentum loss mechanisms in smaller and cooler objects become more

dwarfs of the same effective temperatures arising from both lower surface
gravities and enhanced atmospheric opacity. We highlight several diagnostics
for enhanced metallicity. A stronger CO absorption band at 4.5 $\mu$m for the
warmest objects is predicted. At all temperatures, enhanced flux in $K$ band is
expected due to reduced collisional induced absorption by H$_2$. This leads to
correspondingly redder near infrared colors, which are redder than solar
metallicity models with the same surface gravity by up to 0.7 in $J-K$ and 1.5
in $H-K$. Molecular absorption band depths increase as well, most significantly
for the coolest objects. We also qualitatively assess the changes to emitted
spectra due to nonequilibrium chemistry.

have been detected in several Galactic globular clusters (GCs). This study is
based on a homogeneous data set of hundreds of medium resolution spectra of
stars in eight GCs. Two of the clusters are believed to be former members of
the Sagittarius dSph galaxy. Our sample comprises stars in different
evolutionary states, namely the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) region, the
subgiant branch (SGB), and the base of the red giant branch (RGB). We compare
the relative CN and CH line strengths of stars in the same evolutionary states.
The majority of the examined clusters show significant variations in their CN
and CH abundances at the base of the RGB. The two former Sgr dSph clusters do
not exhibit any CN-strong stars. Our results suggest that the environment in
which the clusters influences existence of CN-strong stars. We confirm the
known anticorrelation between CN and CH for most of the observed GCs. Although
the signal of CN absorption is weaker for the hotter stars on the MSTO and SGB
we observed the same anticorrelation in these less evolved stars for the
CN-bimodal clusters. The inclusion of structural parameters taken from
literature reveals that the existence of the CN-bifurcation seems to be
independent of most other cluster characteristics. In particular, we do not
confirm the correlation between cluster ellipticity and number of CN-strong
stars. However, there may be a trend of an increased percentage of CN-strong
stars with increasing cluster tidal radius and total luminosity. We argue that
our findings are consistent with pollution by intermediate AGB stars and/or
fast rotating massive stars and two generations of star formation in luminous
clusters with larger tidal radii at larger Galactocentric distances.

We discuss in detail the properties of galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features

the incidence of Wolf-Rayet galaxies with redshift and show that the likelihood
of otherwise similar galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features increases with
increasing metallicity, but that WR features are found in galaxies of a wide
range in morphology. The large sample allows us to show explicitly that there
are systematic differences in the metal abundances of WR and non-WR galaxies.
The most striking result is that, below EW(Hb)=100AA, Wolf-Rayet galaxies show
an elevated N/O relative to non-WR galaxies. We interpret this as a rapid
enrichment of the ISM from WR winds. We also show that the model predictions
for WR features strongly disagree with the observations at low metallicity;
while they do agree quite well with the data at solar abundances. We discuss
possible reasons for this and show that models incorporating binary evolution
reproduce the low-metallicity results reasonably well. Finally we combine the
WR sample with a sample of galaxies with nebular He II 4686 to show that, at 12

arguing for a less dense stellar wind at these metallicities, while at higher

from 92 protostellar cores in the 1.1 mm core samples from Enoch et al. (2006),
Young et al. (2006), and Enoch et al. (2007). A comparison of these populations
reveals the initial conditions of the starless cores. Starless cores in Perseus
have similar masses but larger sizes and lower densities on average than
protostellar cores, with sizes that suggest density profiles substantially
flatter than r^-2. By contrast, starless cores in Serpens are compact and have
lower masses than protostellar cores; future star formation will likely result
in lower mass objects than the currently forming protostars. Comparison to
dynamical masses estimated from the NH_3 survey of Perseus cores by Rosolowsky
et al. (2007) suggests that most of the starless cores are likely to be
gravitationally bound, and thus prestellar. The combined prestellar core mass
distribution includes 108 cores and has a slope of -2.3+/-0.4 for M>0.8 Msun.
This slope is consistent with recent measurements of the stellar initial mass
function, providing further evidence that stellar masses are directly linked to
the core formation process. We place a lower limit on the core-to-star
efficiency of 25%. There are approximately equal numbers of prestellar and
protostellar cores in each cloud, thus the dense prestellar core lifetime must
be similar to the lifetime of embedded protostars, or 4.5x10^5 years, with a
total uncertainty of a factor of two. Such a short lifetime suggests a dynamic,
rather than quasi-static, core evolution scenario, at least at the relatively
high mean densities (n>2x10^4 cm^-3) to which we are sensitive.

that any pair of authorized sets in an access structure should overlap. From
the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint on secret
sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS), where access
structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is permissible, provided
some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show that no more than
$\lambda-1$ withheld shares are required, where $\lambda$ is the minimum number
of {\em partially linked classes} among the authorized sets for the QSS. Our
result means that such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the
no-cloning theorem. Secondly, we point out a way of combining the features of
QSS and quantum key distribution (QKD) for applications where a classical
information is shared by quantum means. We observe that in such case, it is
often possible to reduce the security proof of QSS to that of QKD.

spin can be manipulated electrically without the need of high-frequency
magnetic fields. Here we realize electrically-driven addressable spin rotations

function-coding information quantity of a genome consists of two parts,
p-coding information quantity which encodes functional protein and n-coding
information quantity which encodes other functional elements except amino acid
sequence. The relation of the proposed law to the thermodynamic laws is
indicated. The evolutionary trends of DNA sequences revealed by bioinformatics
are investigated which afford further evidences on the evolutionary law. It is
argued that the directionality of genome evolution comes from species

deformation procedure recently used to describe kinklike defects in order to
build networks of topological defects, which appear from complex field models
with potentials that engender a finite number of isolated minima, both in the
case where the minima present discrete symmetry, and in the non symmetric case.
We show that the presence of symmetry guide us to the construction of regular
networks, while the non symmetric case gives rise to irregular networks which
spread throughout the complex field space. We also discuss bifurcation, a
phenomenon that appear in the non symmetric case, but is washed out by the
deformation procedure used in the present work.

which enables efficient and exact sampling of the (Boltzmann/Gibbs) canonical
distribution associated to Hamiltonian systems with fast degrees of freedom
(fDOFs). The penalty parameters enable arbitrary tuning of the timescale for
the selected fDOFs, and the method is interpreted as an interpolation between
the exact Hamiltonian dynamics and the dynamics with infinitely slow fDOFs
(equivalent to geometrically corrected rigid constraints). This property
translates in the associated numerical methods into a tunable trade-off between
stability and dynamical modification. The penalization is based on an extended
Hamiltonian with artificial constraints associated with each fDOF. By
construction, the resulting dynamics is statistically exact with respect to the
canonical distribution in position variables.
  The algorithms can be easily implemented with standard geometric integrators
with algebraic constraints given by the expected fDOFs, and has no additional
complexity in terms of enforcing the constraint and force evaluations. The
method is demonstrated on a high dimensional system with non-convex
interactions. Prescribing the macroscopic dynamical timescale, it is shown that
the IMMP method increases the time-step stability region with a gain that grows
linearly with the size of the system. The latter property, as well as
consistency of the macroscopic dynamics of the IMMP method is proved rigorously
for linear interactions. Finally, when a large stiffness parameter is
introduced, the IMMP method can be tuned to be asymptotically stable,
converging towards the heuristically expected Markovian effective dynamics on
the slow manifold.

GRB 070125 is among the brightest afterglows observed to date. The spectral
energy distribution implies a host extinction of Av < 0.9 mag. Two
rebrightening episodes are observed, one with excellent time coverage, showing
an increase in flux of 56% in ~8000 seconds. The evolution of the afterglow
light curve is achromatic at all times. Late-time observations of the afterglow
do not show evidence for emission from an underlying host galaxy or supernova.
Any host galaxy would be subluminous, consistent with current GRB host-galaxy
samples. Evidence for strong Mg II absorption features is not found, which is
perhaps surprising in view of the relatively high redshift of this burst and
the high likelihood for such features along GRB-selected lines of sight.

high-magnification events, and a significant fraction of these events exhibit a
double-peak structure at their peak. However, very wide or very close binaries
can also produce double-peaked high-magnification events, with the same gross
properties as those produced by planets. Traditionally, distinguishing between
these two interpretations has relied upon detailed modeling, which is both
time-consuming and generally does not provide insight into the observable
properties that allow discrimination between these two classes of models. We
study the morphologies of these two classes of double-peaked high-magnification
events, and identify a simple diagnostic that can be used to immediately
distinguish between perturbations caused by planetary and binary companions,
without detailed modeling. This diagnostic is based on the difference in the
shape of the intra-peak region of the light curves. The shape is smooth and
concave for binary lensing, while it tends to be either boxy or convex for
planetary lensing. In planetary lensing this intra-peak morphology is due to
the small, weak cusp of the planetary central caustic located between the two
stronger cusps. We apply this diagnostic to five observed double-peaked
high-magnification events to infer their underlying nature. A corollary of our
study is that good coverage of the intra-peak region of double-peaked
high-magnification events is likely to be important for their unique
interpretation.

condition (the linear-response regime). The prototypal device consists of a
hornlike electron waveguide with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is
connected to two leads with different widths. It is demonstrated that when
electrons are incident from the narrow lead, the generated spin conductance
fluctuates around a constant value in a wide range of incident energy. When the
transport direction is reversed, the spin conductance is suppressed strongly.
Such a remarkable difference arises from spin-flipped transitions caused by the
spin-orbit interaction.

dimension, we study self-similar cosmological models in 5D that are
homogeneous, anisotropic and spatially flat. The ""ladder"" to go between the
physics in 5D and 4D is provided by Campbell-Maagard's embedding theorems. We
show that the 5-dimensional field equations $R_{AB} = 0$ determine the form of
the similarity variable. There are three different possibilities: homothetic,
conformal and ""wave-like"" solutions in 5D. We derive the most general
homothetic and conformal solutions to the 5D field equations. They require the
extra dimension to be spacelike, and are given in terms of one arbitrary
function of the similarity variable and three parameters. The Riemann tensor in
5D is not zero, except in the isotropic limit, which corresponds to the case
where the parameters are equal to each other. The solutions can be used as 5D
embeddings for a great variety of 4D homogeneous cosmological models, with and
without matter, including the Kasner universe. Since the extra dimension is
spacelike, the 5D solutions are invariant under the exchange of spatial
coordinates. Therefore they also embed a family of spatially {\it
inhomogeneous} models in 4D. We show that these models can be interpreted as
vacuum solutions in braneworld theory. Our work (I) generalizes the 5D
embeddings used for the FLRW models; (II) shows that anisotropic cosmologies
are, in general, curved in 5D, in contrast with FLRW models which can always be
embedded in a 5D Riemann-flat (Minkowski) manifold; (III) reveals that
anisotropic cosmologies can be curved and devoid of matter, both in 5D and 4D,
even when the metric in 5D explicitly depends on the extra coordinate, which is
quite different from the isotropic case.

at any frequency which is attributable to GW Lib type pulsations, to a

studies which have found three pulsation frequencies with amplitudes of 9 to 11
mmag at optical wavelengths. Destructive interference and changes to the
thermal properties of the driving layer in direct response to accretion can be
ruled out as causes of the non-detection. Alternatively, it is feasible that
the object has cooled out of the instability strip since a previous
(unobserved) dwarf nova superoutburst. This would be the first time this

is that changes in the surface characteristics, possibly induced by accretion

prepared by sputtering at normal incidence. The optical properties are studied
by spectroscopic ellipsometry, in the range 0.6-6.5 eV, and with Mueller matrix
ellipsometry in the visible range, 1.46-2.88 eV. The optical measurements are
compared to direct topography measurements obtained by Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM),
and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Good agreement is achieved between the two
classes of methods when the experimental optical response of the short cones
(<55 nm) is inverted with respect to topological surface information via a
graded anisotropic effective medium model. The main topological parameter
measured was the average cone height, but estimates of typical cone shape and
density (in terms of volume fractions) were also obtained. The graded
anisotropic effective medium model treats the cones as a stack of concentric
cylinders (discs) of non-increasing radii. Optical methods are shown to
represent a valuable characterization tool for nanostructured surfaces, in

specific diquark effective degrees of freedom inside hadrons. In order to
understand the underlying dynamics for exotic hadrons, a search for the
tetraquark $X(ud\bar{s}\bar{s})$ is strongly recommended. The proposed reaction
involves two $\Lambda$ production, of which the narrow widths make it a great
advantage in the analysis of the final state missing mass spectrum. We make an
estimate of the production rate of $X(ud\bar{s}\bar{s})$ in an effective
Lagrangian theory and find that for $J^P=1^-$ the sample events of $\sim 2200 \
nb^{-1}$ will be able to identify $X(ud\bar{s}\bar{s})$ with five standard
deviations at a width of 10 MeV to $K^+K^0$ near threshold. For $J^P=1^+$ with
a width of 20 MeV to $KK^*$, the sample events of $\sim 130 nb^{-1}$ will be
needed. Large production cross sections are expected in a kinematic region
beyond the threshold. We emphasize the advantage of low background in this
transition channel, and in the meantime caution the large uncertainties in the
present estimate due to lack of knowledge about the $X(ud\bar{s}\bar{s})$
state. Implications for its heavy-flavored partners $qq\bar{c}\bar{c}$ and

that this observation can be explained using a binary model that involve mass
transfer from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star companion and, based on
this model, we predict F abundances in CEMP stars in general. We discuss wether
F can be used to discriminate between the formation histories of most CEMP
stars: via binary mass transfer or from the ejecta of fast-rotating massive
stars. We compute AGB yields using different stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis codes to evaluate stellar model uncertainties. We use a simple
dilution model to determine the factor by which the AGB yields should be
diluted to match the abundances observed in HE 1305+0132. We further employ a
binary population synthesis tool to estimate the probability of F-rich CEMP
stars. The abundances observed in HE 1305+0132 can be explained if this star
accreted 3-11% of the mass lost by its former AGB companion. The primary AGB
star should have dredged-up at least 0.2 Msun of material from its He-rich
region into the convective envelope via third dredge-up, which corresponds to
AGB models of Z ~ 0.0001 and mass ~ 2 Msun. Many AGB model uncertainties, such
as the treatment of convective borders and mass loss, require further
investigation. We find that in the binary scenario most CEMP stars should also
be FEMP stars, that is, have [F/Fe] > +1, while fast-rotating massive stars do
not appear to produce fluorine. We conclude that fluorine is a signature of
low-mass AGB pollution in CEMP stars, together with elements associated with
the slow neutron-capture process.

candidate, and another, IRS 7B, is suggested to be in the Class 0/I transition
stage. IRS 7B is associated with extended radio lobes at 6 and 20 cm. The lobes
may have a gyrosynchrotron emission component, which could be understood in
terms of Fermi accleration in shocks. The Class I objects detected here seem to
be a mixed lot. One of these, the wide binary IRS 5, shows a negative spectral
index, rapid variability, and a high degree of circular polarisation with
$V/I\approx33$ % on one of the days of observation. These signs of magnetic
activity suggest that at least one of the binary components has advanced beyond
the Class I stage. The radio source without YSO assigment, Radio Source 5, has
been suggested to be a brown dwarf. The radio properties, in particular its
persistent strong emission, do not support this classification. The radio
characteristics of the detected YSOs roughly agree with the scheme where the
dominant emission mechanism changes with age. The heterogeneity of the Class I
group can possibly be explained by a drastic decline in the jet activity during
this stage, which also changes the efficiency of free-free absorption around

distribution of rupture forces and present a detailed discussion of the
influence of finite rebinding probabilities on the dynamic force spectrum. In
particular, we focus on barrier crossing upon extension, i.e. under linearly
increased load, and upon relaxation starting from completely separated bonds.
For large loading rates the rupture force and the rejoining force depend on the
loading rate in the expected manner determined by the shape of the potential.
For small loading rates the mean forces obtained from pull and relax modes
approach each other as the system reaches equilibrium. We investigate the
dependence of the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces on
external parameters like cantilever stiffness and influence of a soft linker.
We find that depending on the implementation of a soft linker the equilibrium
rupture force is either unaffected by the presence of the linker or changes in
a predictable way with the linker-compliance. Additionally, we show that it is
possible to extract the equilibrium constant of the on- and off-rates from the
determination of the equilibrium rupture forces.

  Congestion Games",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the convergence time of the best response dynamics in
player-specific singleton congestion games. It is well known that this dynamics
can cycle, although from every state a short sequence of best responses to a
Nash equilibrium exists. Thus, the random best response dynamics, which selects
the next player to play a best response uniformly at random, terminates in a
Nash equilibrium with probability one. In this paper, we are interested in the
expected number of best responses until the random best response dynamics
terminates.
  As a first step towards this goal, we consider games in which each player can
choose between only two resources. These games have a natural representation as
(multi-)graphs by identifying nodes with resources and edges with players. For
the class of games that can be represented as trees, we show that the
best-response dynamics cannot cycle and that it terminates after O(n^2) steps
where n denotes the number of resources. For the class of games represented as
cycles, we show that the best response dynamics can cycle. However, we also
show that the random best response dynamics terminates after O(n^2) steps in
expectation.
  Additionally, we conjecture that in general player-specific singleton
congestion games there exists no polynomial upper bound on the expected number
of steps until the random best response dynamics terminates. We support our
conjecture by presenting a family of games for which simulations indicate a
super-polynomial convergence time.

the first time a large scale complex of arcing loops that is an excellent
example of how a low-mass satellite accretion can produce an interwoven,
rosette-like structure of debris dispersed in the halo of its host galaxy. The
existence of this structure, which has probably formed and survived for several
Gigayears, confirms that halos of spiral galaxies in the Local Universe may
still contain a significant number of galactic fossils from their hierarchical
formation. To examine the validity of the external accretion scenario, we
present N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy-like
system in a disk galaxy plus dark halo potential that demonstrate that most of
the observed tidal features observed in NGC 5907 can be explained by a single
accretion event. Unfortunately, with no kinematic data and only the projected
geometry of the stream as constraint, the parameters of our model are
considerably degenerate and, for now, must be considered illustrative only.
Interestingly, NGC 5907 has long been considered a prototypical example of a
warped spiral in relative isolation. The presence of an extended tidal stream
challenges this picture and suggests that the gravitational perturbations
induced by the stream progenitor may be the cause for the warp. The detection
of an old, complex tidal stream in a nearby galaxy with rather modest
instrumentation points to the viability of surveys to find extragalactic tidal
substructures around spiral galaxies in the Local Volume (< 15 Mpc) -- with the
prospect of obtaining a census with enough statistical significance to be
compared with cosmological simulations.

disk gas does not influence the radial chemical gradients on large scale, as
required by the chemical models of the Milky Way which reproduce the

distributions spanning a range of metallicities and star formation rates

corresponding to a spread in [Fe/H]=0.6 dex with substructures in the inner and

extinction effects on the galaxy disc. Maps showing the distribution of mean

clusters and groups at z=0.4-0.8 depend on projected local galaxy density, and
compare with the field at similar redshifts and clusters at low-z. In both
nearby and distant clusters, higher-density regions contain proportionally
fewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [OII] equivalent width of
star-forming galaxies is independent of local density. However, in distant
clusters the average current star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming galaxies
seems to peak at densities ~15-40 galaxies Mpc^{-2}. At odds with low-z
results, at high-z the relation between star-forming fraction and local density
varies from high- to low-mass clusters. Overall, our results suggest that at
high-z the current star formation (SF) activity in star-forming galaxies does
not depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible SFR
peak seems at odds with this conclusion. We find that the cluster SFR
normalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with the
star-forming fraction. These trends can be understood given a) that the average
star-forming galaxy forms about 1 Msun/yr in all clusters; b) that the total
number of galaxies scales with cluster mass and c) the dependence of
star-forming fraction on cluster mass. We present the morphology-density (MD)
relation for our z=0.4-0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiral
fraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of types Sc or later. For
galaxies of a given Hubble type, we see no evidence that SF properties depend
on local environment. In contrast with recent findings at low-z, in our distant

magnifications predicted for giant arcs obtained from isothermal and NFW
profiles, taking axially-symmetric and asymmetric mass distributions into
account. We find that arc magnifications can differ strongly between the two
types of density profiles even if the image morphology is well reproduced.
Magnifications by lenses with NFW density profiles are usually larger than
those for lenses with singular or nearly singular isothermal density profiles,
unless the latter have large cores. Asymmetries play an important role. We
illustrate our results with the two well-studied clusters MS 2137 and A~370. We
confirm earlier results showing that both isothermal and NFW mass models can
very well reproduce the observed arcs, radial arcs and other arclets. While the
mass model for MS 2137 is not very well constrained, the two types of mass
models produce strongly differing critical curves and caustics for A~370. We
find that the NFW mass profile is preferred for A~370. We identify new arclet
candidates in the field of A~370. Redshift estimates allowed by the lens model

multi-particle interference observable in joint-detection of distant
particle-detectors. Ghost imaging is one of such phenomena. Two types of ghost
imaging have been experimentally demonstrated since 1995. Type-one ghost
imaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source. The nonlocal
point-to-point image-forming correlation is the result of a
constructive-destructive superposition among a large number of biphoton
amplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of producing a joint-detction event between
distant photodetectors. Type-two ghost imaging uses chaotic-thermal light. The
type-two image-forming correlation is the result of interferences between
paired two-photon amplitudes, corresponding to two different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a join-detection event by two
independent photons. A great deal of confusion about ghost imaging comes from
""ghost shadow"". Similar to x-ray photography, a ghost shadow can be made in
coincidences by ""blocking-partial blocking-unblocking"" of either co-rotating
laser beams or classically correlated ""speckles"". ""Ghost shadow"" is indeed a
classical phenomenon. The physics of ghost imaging, however, is fundamentally
different. This article is aimed at exploring the nonlocal two-photon
interference nature of ghost imaging.

feature many absorption lines. For the first time, we fit simultaneously as

explained by stellar populations containing a sizable amount (20 to 56 % by
mass) of ~1Gyr old stellar population with Thermally Pulsing-Asymptotic Giant
Branch stars. We found that the metallicity of the stars which dominates the
light is solar. Metallicities substantially different from solar give a worse
fit. Though the ages and metallicities we estimate using the NIR spectroscopy
are in agreement with values from the literature based on the UV/optical, we
find older ages and a larger age spread. This may be due to the fact that the
optical is mostly sensitive to the last episode of star formation, while the
NIR better maintains the record of previous stellar generations. Another
interesting result is that the reddening estimated from the whole NIR spectrum
is considerably lower than that based on emission lines. Finally, we find a

perform 3D simulations in the shearing box approximation, with a net magnetic
flux, and we consider computational domains with different aspect ratios
Results: We find that in boxes of aspect ratio unity the transport of angular
momentum is strongly intermittent and dominated by channel solutions in
agreement with previous work. In contrast, in boxes with larger aspect ratio,
the channel solutions and the associated intermittent behavior disappear.
Conclusions: There is strong evidence that, as the aspect ratio becomes larger,
the characteristics of the solution become aspect ratio independent. We
conclude that shearing box calculations with aspect ratio unity or near unity
may introduce spurious effects.

adiabatic accretion of gas from the surrounding cluster, to densities such that
stellar collisions are a likely outcome. We show that the maximum densities
attained, and hence the viability of collisions, depends on a competition
between core shrinkage (driven by accretion) and core puffing up (driven by
relaxation effects). The expected number of collisions scales as
$N_{core}^{5/3} \tilde v^2$ where $N_{core}$ is the number of stars in the
cluster core and $\tilde v$ is the free fall velocity of the parent cluster
(gas reservoir). Thus whereas collisions are very unlikely in a relatively low
mass, low internal velocity system such as the Orion Nebula Cluster, they
become considerably more important at the mass and velocity scale
characteristic of globular clusters. Thus stellar collisions in response to
accretion induced core shrinkage remains a viable prospect in more massive
clusters, and may contribute to the production of intermediate mass black holes
in these systems.

neutrons from the $^2H(\pi^-,n \gamma)n$ capture reaction. The measurements
were done at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility by the E1286 collaboration.
The high spatial resolution of our gamma-ray detector enabled us to make a
detailed assessment of the systematic uncertainties in our techniques. The
value obtained in the present work is $a_{nn} = -18$.63 $\pm $0.10
(statistical) $\pm$ 0.44 (systematic) $\pm$ 0.30 (theoretical) fm. This result
is consistent with previous determinations of $a_{nn}$ from the $\pi^-d$
capture reaction. We found that the analysis of the data with calculations that
use a relativistic phase-space factor gives a more negative value for $a_{nn}$
by 0.33 fm over the analysis done using a nonrelativistic phase-space factor.
Combining the present result with the previous ones from $\pi^-d$ capture
gives: $a_{nn} = - 18$.63 $\pm$ 0.27 (expt) $\pm$ 0.30 fm (theory). For the
first time the combined statistical and systematic experimental uncertainty in
$a_{nn}$ is smaller than the theoretical uncertainty and comparable to the
uncertainty in the proton-proton $^1S_0$ scattering length ($a_{pp}$). This
average value of $a_{nn}$ when corrected for the magnetic-moment interaction of
the two neutrons becomes -18.9 $\pm$ 0.4 fm which is 1.6 $\pm$ 0.5 fm different
from the recommended value of $a_{pp}$, thereby confirming charge symmetry
breaking at the 1% confidence level.

Einstein spaces, for which the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric. The
classical field equations for the potential are then equivalent to first
solving a scalar wave equation with cosmological constant, and then solving a
vector wave equation where the inhomogeneous term is obtained from the gradient
of the solution of the scalar wave equation. The Eastwood--Singer condition
leads to a field equation on the potential which is preserved under gauge
transformations provided that the scalar function therein obeys a fourth-order
equation where the highest-order term is the wave operator composed with
itself. The second-order scalar equation is here solved in de Sitter spacetime,
and also the fourth-order equation in a particular case, and these solutions
are found to admit an exponential decay at large time provided that
square-integrability for positive time is required. Last, the vector wave

physics at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. One of the direct
consequences of vacuum energy is the Casimir Force, which is a force of
attraction experienced by a pair of infinite planar conductive plates placed in
vacuum. Experiments to measure Casimir force have been carried out since the
1950s. This thesis presents a measurement of Casimir force between a flat and a
spherical conducting surface using a torsion balance for separations in the
range of 1 micron to 8 micron. The details of the construction of the torsion
balance apparatus, the experimental procedure and the analysis to obtain the
Casimir force as a function of separation are described. There are indications
of the finite temperature effects which become important for separations
greater than ~ 3microns. The combined import of this experiment with others at
shorter distances is to favor the finite temperature theory of Casimir forces.
The contributions of this experiment towards bounding the strength of inverse

so far by H. Bell, for the plane fixed point problem. Some of these results had
been announced much earlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define
the concept of the variation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to
the index of the map on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. We develop a prime
end theory through hyperbolic chords in maximal round balls contained in the
complement of a non-separating plane continuum $X$. We define the concept of an
{\em outchannel} for a fixed point free map which carries the boundary of $X$
minimally into itself and prove that such a map has a \emph{unique} outchannel,
and that outchannel must have variation $=-1$. We also extend Bell's linchpin
theorem for a foliation of a simply connected domain, by closed convex subsets,
to arbitrary domains in the sphere.
  We introduce the notion of an oriented map of the plane. We show that the
perfect oriented maps of the plane coincide with confluent (that is composition
of monotone and open) perfect maps of the plane. We obtain a fixed point
theorem for positively oriented, perfect maps of the plane. This generalizes
results announced by Bell in 1982 (see also \cite{akis99}). It follows that if
$X$ is invariant under an oriented map $f$, then $f$ has a point of period at
most two in $X$.
