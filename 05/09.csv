is a better framework than the perturbative Type IIB string theory. The duality
between the Heterotic and F-theory is a powerful tool in gaining more insights
into F-theory description of low-energy chiral multiplets. Because chiral
multiplets from bundles /\^2 V and /\^2 V^x as well as those from a bundle V
are all involved in Yukawa couplings in Heterotic compactification, we need to
translate descriptions of all those kinds of matter multiplets into F-theory
language through the duality. We find that chiral matter multiplets in F-theory
are global holomorphic sections of line bundles on what we call covering matter
curves. The covering matter curves are formulated in Heterotic theory in
association with normalization of spectral surface, while they are where
M2-branes wrapped on a vanishing two-cycle propagate in F-theory. Chirality
formulae are given purely in terms of (possibly primitive) four-form flux. In
order to complete the translation, the dictionary of the Heterotic--F theory
duality has to be refined in some aspects. A precise map of spectral surface
and complex structure moduli is obtained, and with the map, we find that
divisors specifying the line bundles correspond precisely to codimension-3
singularities in F-theory.

phase transitions, such as might arise if the gauge structure of the standard
model is extended by additional U(1) factors at high energies. Cosmic strings
present in the early universe form a network of long horizon-length segments,
as well as a population of closed string loops. The closed loops are unstable
against decay, and can be a source of non-thermal particle production. In this
work we compute the density of WIMP dark matter formed by the decay of gauge
theory cosmic string loops derived from a network of long strings in the
scaling regime or under the influence of frictional forces. We find that for
symmetry breaking scales larger than 10^10 GeV, this mechanism has the
potential to account for the observed relic density of dark matter. For
symmetry breaking scales lower than this, the density of dark matter created by
loop decays from a scaling string network lies below the observed value. In
particular, the cosmic strings originating from a U(1) gauge symmetry broken
near the electroweak scale, that could lead to a massive Z' gauge boson
observable at the LHC, produce a negligibly small dark matter relic density by
this mechanism.

that the Watson-Crick base pairing and the non-specific base pairing of the

enough features to determine the coding constraints of the primeval and the
modern genetic code, as well as, the transition from the former to the later.
Geometrical and algebraic properties of this vector space reveal that the

There emerges a new relativistic dynamics where a minimum speed forms an

of such a minimum speed is that it prevents the absolute zero temperature for
an ultracold gas according to the third law of thermodynamics. So we will be

alternatively it can relax initially to a metastable nematic phase and then
decay to the equilibrium stripe phase through nucleation. We measure the
distribution of equilibration times for both processes and compute their
relative probability of occurrence as a function of temperature and system
size. This peculiar relaxation mechanism is due to the strong metastability of
the nematic phase, which goes deep in the low temperature stripe phase. We also
measure quasi-equilibrium autocorrelations in a wide range of temperatures.
They show a distinct decay to a plateau that we identify as due to a finite
fraction of frozen spins in the nematic phase. We find indications that the
plateau is a finite size effect. Relaxation times as a function of temperature
in the metastable region show super-Arrhenius behavior, suggesting a possible
glassy behavior of the system at low temperatures.

abundances that allowed us to construct an IDF for the bulge that, for the
first time, is based on high-resolution spectroscopy for each individual star.
The IDF derived here is centered on solar metallicity, and extends from [Fe/H]~
-1.5 to [Fe/H]~ +0.5. The distribution is asymmetric, with a sharper cutoff on
the high-metallicity side, and it is narrower than previously measured. A
variation in the mean metallicity along the bulge minor axis is clearly between
b=-4 deg and b=-6 deg ([Fe/H] decreasing by ~ 0.6 dex per kpc). The field at
b=-12 deg is consistent with the presence of a gradient, but its quantification
is complicated by the higher disk/bulge fraction in this field. Our findings
support a scenario in which both infall and outflow were important during the
bulge formation, and then suggest the presence of a radial gradient, which
poses some challenges to the scenario in which the bulge would result solely
from the vertical heating of the bar.

shorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired

The capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier
interference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due
to the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different
frequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users.
Centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and
inefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a
two-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized
spectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division
multiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms
of Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible Quality of
Service (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell
users attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of
this allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel
interference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. Design

demonstrating that both stars emit X-rays and thereby enabling the first

appears to have been in a flaring state during the first (2004 December)

hardened significantly. Single-component plasma models with plasma temperatures

galaxy group catalogs constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Yang et
al. 2007, Berlind et al. 2006a). In the model, the environmental dependence of
galaxy color is determined by that of halo mass, and the predicted color mark
correlations were shown to be consistent with SDSS measurements. The model
assumes that satellites tend to follow a color-magnitude sequence that
approaches the red sequence at bright luminosities; the model's success
suggests that bright satellites tend to be `red and dead' while the star
formation in fainter ones is in the process of being quenched. In both the
model and the SDSS group catalogs, we find that at fixed luminosity or stellar
mass, central galaxies tend to be bluer than satellites. In contrast, at fixed
group richness or halo mass, central galaxies tend to be redder than
satellites, and galaxy colors become redder with increasing mass. We also
compare the central and satellite galaxy color distributions, as a function of

walks to solve search problems on these graphs. The particle making the walk
resides on the edges of the graph, and at each time step scatters at the
vertices. All of the vertices have the same scattering properties except for a
subset of special vertices. The object of the search is to find a special
vertex. A quantum circuit implementation of these walks is presented in which
the set of special vertices is specified by a quantum oracle. We consider the
complete graph, a complete bipartite graph, and an $M$-partite graph. In all
cases, the dimension of the Hilbert space in which the time evolution of the
walk takes place is small (between three and six), so the walks can be
completely analyzed analytically. Such dimensional reduction is due to the fact
that these graphs have large automorphism groups. We find the usual quadratic
quantum speedups in all cases considered.

Gaussian initial conditions down to scales on which the rms fluctuation is
slightly greater than unity. We also show how the highly non-Gaussian

transformed so that it provides an estimate of the shape of the initial

processed through the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SUNRISE. With the
resulting images, we examine the dependence of quantitative morphology (G, M20,

parameters, gas properties, supernova feedback, and total mass. We find that
mergers appear most disturbed in G-M20 and asymmetry at the first pass and at
the final coalescence of their nuclei, but can have normal quantitative
morphologies at other merger stages. The merger observability time-scales
depend on the method used to identify the merger as well as the gas fraction,
pericentric distance, and relative orientation of the merging galaxies.
Enhanced star formation peaks after and lasts significantly longer than strong
morphological disturbances. Despite their massive bulges, the majority of
merger remnants appear disc-like and dusty in g-band light because of the
presence of a low-mass star-forming disc.

calculated the vacuum energy of the $i\phi^{3}$ scalar field theory and its
Hermitian equivalent theory up to $g^{4}$ order of calculations. While all the
Feynman diagrams of the $i\phi^{3}$ theory are finite in $0+1$ space-time

Hermitian theory are divergent. In this work, we show that the divergences in
the Hermitian theory originate from superrenormalizable, renormalizable and
non-renormalizable terms in the interaction Hamiltonian even though the
calculations are carried out in the $0+1$ space-time dimensions. Relying on
this interesting result, we raise the question, is the superficial degree of
divergence of a theory is representation dependent? To answer this question, we
introduce and study a class of non-Hermitian quantum field theories
characterized by a field derivative interaction Hamiltonian. We showed that the
class is physically acceptable by finding the corresponding class of metric
operators in a closed form. We realized that the obtained equivalent Hermitian
and the introduced non-Hermitian representations have coupling constants of
different mass dimensions which may be considered as a clue for the possibility
of considering non-Renormalizability of a field theory as a non-genuine
problem. Besides, the metric operator is supposed to disappear from path
integral calculations which means that physical amplitudes can be fully
obtained in the simpler non-Hermitian representation.

high-pressure cell (DAC) containing a microscopic sample of typical diameter
~50-100 micrometer, is mounted on a precision X-Y nanomotor stage that forms
part of an IR laser heating optical assembly. Automation of this stage has been
accomplished using a LabVIEW virtual instrument program to manipulate the X and
Y stages using nanopositioning systems. This has a major feature of enabling a
rastered heating of the sample over a user-defined circular area, without any
operator intervention in addition to a virtual joystick to position the sample
with respect to the laser spot. This auto-rastering feature has the advantage
of offering uniform exposure of a circular area of the sample to the incident
heating laser beam apart from drastic reduction in scan time compared to a
manual scan. The diameter of the circle can be varied from a maximum of ~24 mm
down to the focal spot size of the laser (~few micrometers), enabling thereby
usage of the laser heating arrangement for heating microscopic samples under
high-pressure in a DAC, as well as bulk samples at atmospheric pressure.
Examples for both macro and micro scale automated laser-heating experiments
have been presented. In particular, at the micro scale, auto-raster heated
carbon samples at ~ 17 GPa and ~2000 K showed excellent signatures of diamond
formation compared to manually raster heated samples, highlighting the unique
advantage of auto-raster heating.

disentangle from the predictions of the collinear approaches . This happens
mainly because of the large uncertainties in the latter. On the other hand, our
results indicate that the contribution of diffractive processes to the total

in which steps in the $x$ and $y$ direction are distinguished. In so doing, we
develop tools that would allow for the case $m > 2$ to be studied. %In our

the deceleration parameter to first order around its present value. A detailed
study is carried out by considering two different parameterizations: $q=q_0 +
q_1z$ and $q=q_0 + q_1 z(1+z)^{-1}$, and the associated free parameters ($q_o,
q_1$) are constrained by 3 different supernova samples. The previous analysis
by Riess {\it{et al.}} [ApJ 607, 665, 2004] using the first expansion is
slightly improved and confirmed in light of their recent data ({\emph{Gold}}07
sample). However, by fitting the model with the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)
type Ia sample we find that the best fit to the redshift transition is $z_t =
0.61$ instead of $z_t = 0.46$ as derived by the High-z Supernovae Search
(HZSNS) team. This result based in the SNLS sample is also in good agreement
with the Davis {\it{et al.}} sample, $z_t=0.60^{+0.28}_{-0.11}$ ($1\sigma$).
Such results are in line with some independent analyzes and accommodates more
easily the concordance flat model ($\Lambda$CDM). For both parameterizations,
the three SNe type Ia samples considered favor recent acceleration and past
deceleration with a high degree of statistical confidence level. All the
kinematic results presented here depend neither on the validity of general
relativity nor the matter-energy contents of the Universe.

support of the initial state on regular versus chaotic Floquet eigenstates,
whose phase-space distributions are concentrated on the corresponding regular

from hot gas, as well as many point sources. We have conducted a spectral
survey of the X-ray population of NGC 253 using a deep XMM-Newton
observation.NGC 253 only accounts for ~20% of the XMM-Newton EPIC field of
view, allowing us to identify ~100 X-ray sources that are unlikely to be
associated with NGC\thinspace 253. Hence we were able to make a direct estimate
of contamination from e.g. foreground stars and background galaxies.
  X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of galaxy populations are often used to
characterise their properties. There are several methods for estimating the
luminosities of X-ray sources with few photons. We have obtained spectral fits
for the brightest 140 sources in the 2003 XMM-Newton observation of NGC 253,
and compare the best fit luminosities of those 69 non-nuclear sources
associated with NGC 253 with luminosities derived using other methods.
  We find the luminosities obtained from these various methods to vary
systematically by a factor of up to three for the same data; this is largely
due to differences in absorption.
  We therefore conclude that assuming Galactic absorption is probably unwise;
rather, one should measure the absorption for the population.
  A remarkable correlation has been reported between the XLFs of galaxies and
their star formation rates. However, the XLFs used in that study were obtained
using several different methods. If the sample galaxies were revisited and a
single method were applied, then this correlation may become stronger still.

regular structure and its close resemblance with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays). Reversible circuits are of interest in the design of very low power
circuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is not of much
consideration. Reversibility is essential for Quantum Computing. This paper
examines the testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) composed
of reversible k-CNOT gates. For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set
whose size remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for
others it varies with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as
Constant-Testable, i.e. C-Testable. It has been shown that Reversible Logic
Arrays are C-Testable and size of test set is equal to number of entries in
cells truth table implying that the reversible ILAs are also Optimal-Testable,
i.e. O-Testable. Uniform-Testability, i.e. U-Testability has been defined and
Reversible Heterogeneous ILAs have been characterized as U-Testable. The test
generation problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of cycles
in a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of these
cycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily converted to
an ATPG program has been presented for both 1-D and 2D ILAs. The same
algorithms can be easily extended for n-Dimensional Reversible ILAs.

connection weights change with activity to mold local resistance or
facilitation due to fatigue. Dynamic attractors, corresponding to patterns of
activity, are then easily destabilized according to three main modes, including
one in which the activity shows chaotic hopping among the patterns. We describe
phase transitions to this regime, and show a monotonous dependence of critical
parameters on the heterogeneity of the wiring distribution. Such correlation
between topology and functionality implies, in particular, that tasks which
require unstable behavior --such as pattern recognition, family discrimination
and categorization-- can be most efficiently performed on highly heterogeneous
networks. It also follows a possible explanation for the abundance in nature of
scale--free network topologies.

features are caused by unusual mechanism of excitation vorticity when the RSW's
core get into the surface layer of an active medium. Instead of the well known
scenario of RSW collapse, which takes place after collision of RSW's core with
absorbing boundary, we observed complicated transformations of the core leading
to regeneration (nonlinear ""reflection"" from the boundary) of the RSW or even
to birth of several new RSWs in the surface layer. Computer experiments on
bottlenecked evolution of such the RSW-ensembles (vortex matter) are reported
and a possible explanation of real experiments on spin-lattice relaxation in
dilute paramagnets is proposed on the basis of an analysis of the RSWs
dynamics. Chimera states in RSW-ensembles are revealed and compared with
analogous states in ensembles of nonlocally coupled oscillators. Generally, our

particular initial state for which the walk is transient. We generalize the
Grover walk to show that one can construct in arbitrary dimensions a quantum
walk which is recurrent. This is in great contrast with the classical walks
which are recurrent only for the dimensions $d=1,2$. Finally, we analyze the

modulation (BICM) by modeling the BICM decoder as a mismatched decoder. The
mismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block
lengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to
the same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the
BICM capacity calculated by Caire et al. where BICM was modeled as a set of
independent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise
log-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and
shows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not
required. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with
mismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized
mutual information. We show that the generalized mutual information of the
mismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We
also show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the BICM
mismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be
lower than in the infinite-interleaved model. We also consider the mutual
information appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with EXIT
charts. We show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of the
transmitted symbol and the EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a
pseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. A
different symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side information
refers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual information
lower than the coded modulation capacity.

(UDS) and the Subaru XMM-Newton Survey (SXDS). Utilising the large area
coverage and the excellent available optical+nearIR data, we use a photometric
redshift analysis to derive a new, robust, measurement of the bright end (L>L*)
of the UV-selected luminosity function at high redshift. When combined with
literature studies of the fainter LBG population, our new sample provides
improved constraints on the luminosity function of redshift 5<z<6 LBGs over the
luminosity range 0.1L*<L<10L*. A maximum likelihood analysis returns
best-fitting Schechter function parameters of M*_1500=-20.73, phi*=0.0009
Mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.66 for the luminosity function at z=5, and M*_1500 =
-20.04, phi*=0.0018 Mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.71 at z=6. In addition, an analysis of
the angular clustering properties of our LBG sample demonstrates that luminous
5<z<6 LBGs are strongly clustered (r_0 = 8.1 Mpc), and are consistent with the
occupation of dark matter halos with masses of ~10^{11.5-12.0} Msun. Moreover,
by stacking the available multi-wavelength imaging data for the high-redshift
LBGs it is possible to place useful constraints on their typical stellar mass.
The results of this analysis suggest that luminous LBGs at 5<z<6 have an
average stellar mass of ~10^10 Msun, consistent with the results of the
clustering analysis assuming plausible values for the ratio of stellar to dark
matter. Finally, by combining our luminosity function results with those of the
stacking analysis we derive estimates of ~1x10^7 Msun Mpc^-3 and 4x10^6 Msun
Mpc^-3 for the stellar mass density at z~5 and z~6 respectively.

which have no counterpart in the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this
different framework. We refer to such a geometry as an Extended Absolute
Parallelism (EAP-) geometry. The building blocks of the EAP-geometry are a
nonlinear connection assumed given a priori and $2n$ linearly independent
vector fields (of special form) defined globally on $TM$ defining the
parallelization. Four different $d$-connections are used to explore the
properties of this geometry. Simple and compact formulae for the curvature
tensors and the W-tensors of the four defined $d$-connections are obtained,
expressed in terms of the torsion and the contortion tensors of the EAP-space.
Further conditions are imposed on the canonical $d$-connection assuming that it
is of Cartan type (resp. Berwald type). Important consequences of these
assumptions are investigated. Finally, a special form of the canonical
$d$-connection is studied under which the classical AP-geometry is recovered
naturally from the EAP-geometry. Physical aspects of some of the geometric
objects investigated are pointed out and possible physical implications of the

Using interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding at each transmitter,
it is shown that each user in the network can achieve non-zero secure Degrees
of Freedoms (DoFs) in both scenarios. In particular, the proposed coding scheme
achieves (K-2)/(2K-2) secure DoFs for each user in the interference channel
with confidential messages model, and (K-2)/2K secure DoFs in the case of an

stems from the lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external

the limit of enumeration of directed animals on cyclical versions of the

construction given in [Electron. J. Combin. (2007) 14 R71], we describe the gas
process on the cyclical versions of the lattices as a cyclical Markov chain
(roughly speaking, Markov chains conditioned to come back to their starting
point). Then we introduce a notion of convergence of graphs, such that if
$(G_n)\to G$ then the gas process built on $G_n$ converges in distribution to
the gas process on $G$. That gives a general tool to show that gas processes
related to animals enumeration are often Markovian on lines extracted from
lattices. We provide examples and computations of new generating functions for
directed animals with various sources on the triangular lattice, on the

$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. The source function indicates a previously
unresolved non-Gaussian tail in the directions of the pion pair transverse
momentum (out) and along the beam (long). Model comparisons give robust
estimates for several characteristics of the emission source, including its
transverse size, its mean proper breakup time $\tau$ and its emission duration
$\Delta\tau$. These estimates are incompatible with the predictions for a first
order phase transition. However, they point to significant relative emission
times which could result from a crossover phase transition.

are usually assumed to be random albeit with some hierarchical structure. It is
well known that the interevent statistics observed in these contexts differs
from the Poissonian profile by being long-tailed distributed with resting and
active periods interwoven. Understanding mechanisms generating consistent
statistics have therefore become a central issue. The approach we present is
taken from the Continuous Time Random Walk formalism and represents an
analytical alternative to models of non-trivial priority that have been
recently proposed. Our analysis also goes one step further by looking at the
multifractal structure of the interevent times of human decisions. We here
analyze the inter-transaction time intervals of several financial markets. We
observe that empirical data describes a subtle multifractal behavior. Our model
explains this structure by taking the pausing-time density in the form of a
superstatistics where the integral kernel quantifies the heterogeneous nature
of the executed tasks. An stretched exponential kernel provides a multifractal
profile valid for a certain limited range. A suggested heuristic analytical
profile is capable of covering a broader region.

For

disk, may shortens its lifetime, and stirs up the embedded planetesimals. Due
to its small semi-major axis (18.5 AU) and large eccentricity (e=0.35) the
binary $\gamma$ Cephei represents a particularly challenging example. In the
present study we model the orbital evolution and growth of embedded
protoplanetary cores of about 30 earth masses in the putative protoplanetary
disk surrounding the primary star in the $\gamma$ Cep system. We assume
coplanarity of the disk, binary and planet and perform two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of embedded cores in a protoplanetary disk. The
presence of the eccentric secondary star perturbs the disk periodically and
generates strong spiral arms at periapse which propagate toward the disk
centre. The disk also becomes slightly eccentric (with e_d = 0.1-0.15), and
displays a slow retrograde precession in the inertial frame. For all initial
separations (2.5 to 3.5 AU) we find inward migration of the cores. For initial
semi-major axes (a_p \gsim 2.7), we find a strong increase in the planetary
eccentricity despite the presence of inward migration. Only cores which are
initially far from the disk outer edge have a bounded orbital eccentricity
which converges, roughly to the value of the planet observed in the $\gamma$
Cep system. We have shown that under the condition protoplanetary cores can
form at around 2.5 AU, it is possible to evolve and grow such a core to form a
planet with final outcome similar to that observed.

either to the disruption of a low-mass star or to a quiescent quasi-hydrostatic

advanced numerical methods and detailed microphysics. Assuming spherical or
axial symmetry, we simulate the evolution of the helium core of a $1.25

peak with a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We find that the core helium flash
neither rips the star apart, nor that it significantly alters its structure, as

new predictions concerning mixing of chemical species in red giants.

accuracy of simulations of cosmological structure formation are not currently
well understood. After a discussion of how the relevant discretisation
parameters introduced should be extrapolated to recover the Vlasov-Poisson
limit, we study numerically, and with analytical methods we have developed
recently, the central issue of how finite particle density affects the
precision of results. In particular we focus on the power spectrum at
wavenumbers around and above the Nyquist wavenumber, in simulations in which
the force resolution is taken smaller than the initial interparticle spacing.
Using simulations of identical theoretical initial conditions sampled on four
different ""pre-initial"" configurations (three different Bravais lattices, and a
glass) we obtain a {\it lower bound} on the real discreteness error. With the
guidance of our analytical results, we establish with confidence that the
measured dispersion is not contaminated either by finite box size effects or by
subtle numerical effects. Our results show notably that, at wavenumbers {\it
below} the Nyquist wavenumber, the dispersion increases monotonically in time
throughout the simulation, while the same is true above the Nyquist wavenumber
once non-linearity sets in. For normalizations typical of cosmological
simulations, we find lower bounds on errors at the Nyquist wavenumber of order
of a percent, and larger above this scale. The only way this error may be
reduced below these levels at these scales, and indeed convergence to the
physical limit firmly established, is by extrapolation, at fixed values of the
other relevant parameters, to the regime in which the mean comoving
interparticle distance becomes less than the force smoothing scale.

numerical study of the dynamical evolution of such a system, starting from a
simple class of infinite ``shuffled lattice'' initial conditions. The
clustering, which develops in time starting from scales around the grid scale,
is qualitatively very similar to that seen in cosmological simulations, which
begin from lattices with applied correlated displacements and incorporate an
expanding spatial background. From very soon after the formation of the first
non-linear structures, a spatio-temporal scaling relation describes well the
evolution of the two-point correlations. At larger times the dynamics of these
correlations converges to what is termed ``self-similar'' evolution in
cosmology, in which the time dependence in the scaling relation is specified
entirely by that of the linearized fluid theory. We show how this statistical
mechanical ``toy model'' can be useful in addressing various questions about
these systems which are relevant in cosmology. Some of these questions are
closely analagous to those currently studied in the literature on long range

early O-type dwarf (O5.5 V). We explore two different possibilities for such a
comparison, following what we called evolutionary and observational approaches:
in the evolutionary approach one compares the SEDs of stars defined by the same
values of Teff and logg; in the observational approach the models to be
compared do not necessarily have the same Teff and logg, but produce similar H
and HeI-II optical lines. We find that there is a better agreement, in terms of
Q(H0), the ratio Q(He0)/Q(H0), and the shape of the SEDs predicted by the four
codes in the spectral range between 13 and 30 eV, when models are compared
following the observational approach. However, even in this case, large
differences are found at higher energies.
  We then discuss how the differences in the SEDs may affect the overall
properties of surrounding nebulae in terms of temperature and ionization
structure. We find that the effect over the nebular temperature is not larger
than 300-350 K. Contrarily, the different SEDs produce significantly different
nebular ionization structures. This will lead to important consequences on the
establishment of the ionization correction factors that are used in the
abundance determination of HII regions, as well as in the characterization of
the ionizing stellar population from nebular line ratios.

significant number of stars were formed in the early Universe, however the most
dominant population are the intermediate age stars. This includes a strong
burst of star formation approximately 3 to 4 Gyr ago. Significant population
gradients are also evident. Similar to other dSphs, we have found that recent
star formation was concentrated towards the centre of the system. Furthermore,
we show that the central region harboured a faster rate of chemical enrichment
than the outer parts of Fornax. At the centre, the ancient stars (age > 10 Gyr)
display a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.4, with evidence for three peaks in
the metallicity distribution. Overall, enrichment in Fornax has been highly
efficient: the most recent star formation burst has produced stars with close
to solar metallicity. Our results support a scenario in which Fornax
experienced an early phase of rapid chemical enrichment producing a wide range
of abundances. Star formation gradually decreased until ~4 Gyr ago, when Fornax
experienced a sudden burst of strong star formation activity accompanied by
substantial chemical enrichment. Weaker star forming events followed, and we

the feature. Applying a one-component non-equilibrium ionization model for the

are close to each other along the line of sight. Since fast-moving O-rich
optical knots/filaments are believed to be recoiled metal-rich ejecta, expelled

Phys",,"10.1007/s00220-009-0745-0",,"math.DG gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The definition of quasi-local mass for a bounded space-like region in
space-time is essential in several major unsettled problems in general
relativity. The quasi-local mass is expected to be a type of flux integral on
the boundary two-surface and should be independent of whichever space-like
region it bounds. An important idea which is related to the Hamiltonian
formulation of general relativity is to consider a reference surface in a flat
ambient space with the same first fundamental form and derive the quasi-local
mass from the difference of the extrinsic geometries. This approach has been
taken by Brown-York and Liu-Yau (see also related works) to define such notions
using the isometric embedding theorem into the Euclidean three-space. However,
there exist surfaces in the Minkowski space whose quasilocal mass is strictly
positive. It appears that the momentum information needs to be accounted for to
reconcile the difference. In order to fully capture this information, we use
isometric embeddings into the Minkowski space as references. In this article,
we first prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for such isometric
embeddings. We then solve the boundary value problem for Jang's equation as a
procedure to recognize such a surface in the Minkowski space. In doing so, we
discover new expression of quasi-local mass. The new mass is positive when the
ambient space-time satisfies the dominant energy condition and vanishes on
surfaces in the Minkowski space. It also has the nice asymptotic behavior at
spatial and null infinity. Some of these results were announced in [29].

  Journal",,"10.1086/590056",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A high-resolution spectroscopic survey of postoutburst novae reveals
short-lived heavy element absorption systems in a majority of novae near
maximum light, having expansion velocities of 400-1000 km/s and velocity
dispersions between 35-350 km/s. A majority of systems are accelerated
outwardly, and they all progressively weaken and disappear over timescales of
weeks. A few of the systems having narrow, deeper absorption reveal a rich
spectrum of singly ionized Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba lines. Analysis
of the richest such system, in Nova LMC 2005, shows the excitation temperature
to be 104 K and elements lighter than Fe to have abundance enhancements over
solar values by up to an order of magnitude. The gas causing the absorption
systems must be circumbinary and its origin is most likely mass ejection from
the secondary star. The absorbing gas pre-exists the outburst and may represent
episodic mass transfer events from the secondary star that initiate the nova
outburst(s). If SNe Ia originate in single degenerate binaries, such absorption
systems could be detectable before maximum light

emerge from a needle electrode placed 40 mm above a planar electrode. The
amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses
have rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the
streamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where
only positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive
and negative streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range
from 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only
form a glowing cloud at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5 to 20 kV,
diameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of
d=0.2 mm and v \approx 10^5 m/s. For 20 to 40 kV, their diameters increase by a
factor 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor 2. Above the transition
value of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each
other, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to
increase with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters
of 3 mm and velocities of 4*10^6 m/s, negative streamers are about 20 % slower
and thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and
diameter d is v=0.5 d^2/(mm ns) for both polarities. Streamers of both
polarities dissipate energies of the order of several mJ per streamer while
crossing the gap.
