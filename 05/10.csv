yield significant non-Gaussianity of the local shape, and both signs of the

power spectrum, which together have been recently shown to be a good fit to
WMAP data. We illustrate with a model of inflation inspired from intersecting

orbits are nondegenerate. The embedded contact homology (ECH) index associates
an integer to each relative 2-dimensional homology class of surfaces whose
boundary is the difference between two unions of Reeb orbits. This integer
determines the relative grading on ECH; the ECH differential counts holomorphic
curves in the symplectization of Y whose relative homology classes have ECH
index 1. A known index inequality implies that such curves are (mostly)
embedded and satisfy some additional constraints. In this paper we prove four
new results about the ECH index. First, we refine the relative grading on ECH
to an absolute grading, which associates to each union of Reeb orbits a
homotopy class of oriented 2-plane fields on Y. Second, we extend the ECH index
inequality to symplectic cobordisms between three-manifolds with Hamiltonian
structures, and simplify the proof. Third, we establish general inequalities on
the ECH index of unions and multiple covers of holomorphic curves in
cobordisms. Finally, we define a new relative filtration on ECH, or any other
kind of contact homology of a contact 3-manifold, which is similar to the ECH
index and related to the Euler characteristic of holomorphic curves. This does
not give new topological invariants except possibly in special situations, but
it is a useful computational tool.

evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays (CRs) with
energies >57 EeV that suggests a correlation with the positions of AGN located
within ~75 Mpc. A detailed study of the sample of AGN whose positions are
located within 3.2 degrees of the CR events (and extending our analysis out to
~150 Mpc) shows that most of them are classified as Seyfert 2 and
low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies whose properties
do not differ substantially from other local AGN of the same types. Therefore,
if the production of the highest energy CRs is persistent in nature, i.e.,
operates in a single object on long (>Myr) timescales, the claimed correlation
between the CR events observed by Auger and local active galaxies should be
considered as resulting from a chance coincidence. Additionally, most of the
selected sources do not show significant jet activity, and hence, in most
conservative scenarios, there are no reasons for expecting them to accelerate
CRs up to the highest energies, ~10^20 eV. A future analysis has to take into
account AGN morphology and may yield a correlation with a larger deflection
angle and/or more distant sources. We further argue that the nearby radio
galaxy NGC 5128 (Cen A) alone could be associated with at least 4 events due to
its large radio extent, and PKS 1343-60 (Cen B), another nearby radio galaxy,
can be associated with more than 1 event due to its proximity to the Galactic
plane and, correspondingly, the stronger Galactic magnetic field the UHECRs
encounter during propagation to the Earth. Future gamma-ray observations (by,
e.g., Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and HESS) may provide additional clues
to the nature of the accelerators of the UHECRs in the local Universe.

we describe some recent results on nonlinear hydrodynamic transition to

the problem of turbulent angular momentum transport in accretion disks. We
argue that this concept is very generic and should be applicable to many
astrophysical problems involving a shear flow and non-axisymmetric
instabilities of shear-induced axisymmetric toroidal velocity or magnetic
fields, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz, magnetorotational, Tayler or global
magnetoshear instabilities. In the light of several recent numerical results,
we finally suggest that, similarly to a standard linear instability,
subcritical MHD dynamo processes in high-Reynolds number shear flows could act
as a large-scale driving mechanism of turbulent flows that would in turn
generate an independent small-scale dynamo.

the case of less massive clusters, a hot high velocity ($\sim 1000$ km
s$^{-1}$) stationary wind develops and the metals injected by supernovae are
dispersed to large distances from the cluster. On the other hand, the density
of the thermalized ejecta within massive and compact clusters is sufficiently
large as to immediately provoke the onset of thermal instabilities. These
deplete, particularly in the central densest regions, the pressure and the
pressure gradient required to establish a stationary wind, and instead the
thermally unstable parcels of gas are rapidly compressed, by a plethora of
re-pressurizing shocks, into compact high density condensations. Most of these
are unable to leave the cluster volume and thus accumulate to eventually feed
further generations of star formation.
  The simulations cover an important fraction of the parameter-space, which
allows us to estimate the fraction of the reinserted gas which accumulates
within the cluster and the fraction that leaves the cluster as a function of
the cluster mechanical luminosity, the cluster size and heating efficiency.

  version of Razborov--Rudich; new proof of main result by Salil Vadhan added",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Razborov and Rudich have shown that so-called ""natural proofs"" are not useful
for separating P from NP unless hard pseudorandom number generators do not
exist. This famous result is widely regarded as a serious barrier to proving
strong lower bounds in circuit complexity theory.
  By definition, a natural combinatorial property satisfies two conditions,
constructivity and largeness. Our main result is that if the largeness
condition is weakened slightly, then not only does the Razborov-Rudich proof
break down, but such ""almost-natural"" (and useful) properties provably exist.
Specifically, under the same pseudorandomness assumption that Razborov and
Rudich make, a simple, explicit property that we call ""discrimination"" suffices
to separate P/poly from NP; discrimination is nearly linear-time computable and
almost large, having density 2^{-q(n)} where q is a quasi-polynomial function.
For those who hope to separate P from NP using random function properties in
some sense, discrimination is interesting, because it is constructive, yet may
be thought of as a minor alteration of a property of a random function.
  The proof relies heavily on the self-defeating character of natural proofs.
Our proof technique also yields an unconditional result, namely that there
exist almost-large and useful properties that are constructive, if we are
allowed to call non-uniform low-complexity classes ""constructive."" We note,
though, that this unconditional result can also be proved by a more
conventional counting argument.
  Finally, we give an alternative proof, communicated to us by Salil Vadhan at
FOCS 2008, of one of our theorems, and we make some speculative remarks on the
future prospects for proving strong circuit lower bounds.

fluxoid/pining-center interaction, are discussed and a comprehensive survey of
Hc2 dopants and flux-pinning additives is presented. Current transport through
the powder-processed wire (an extrinsic property) is partially blocked by the
inherent granularity of the material itself and the chemical or other
properties of the intergrain surfaces. These and other such results indicate
that in many cases less than 15% of the conductor's cross sectional area is
able to carry transport current. It is pointed out that densification in
association with the elimination of grain-boundary blocking phases would yield
five-to ten-fold increases in Jc in relevant regimes, enabling the performance
of magnesium diboride in selected applications to compete with that of Nb-Sn.

the low-frequency modes (rigid unit modes, or RUMs) in several important oxide

the ability to support RUMs governs its relaxation in the wide range of

also affects other properties, including crystallization, slow relaxation and
compressibility. At ambient pressure and low temperature, RUM flexibility is
related to the large-scale localized atomic motions. Whether these motions are
interpreted as independent two-level systems or collective density excitations,
the RUM flexibility determines whether and to what extent low-energy

calculate local susceptibility near a nonmagnetic impurity and near a grain
boundary for the nearest neighbor Heisenberg model in high temperature series
expansion. We find that the local susceptibility decays to the uniform one in
few lattice spacings, and for a low density of impurities we would not be able
to explain the line broadening present in the experiments already at elevated
temperatures. At low temperatures, we assume a gapless spin liquid with a Fermi
surface of spinons. We calculate the local susceptibility in the mean field and
also go beyond the mean field by Gutzwiller projection. The zero temperature
local susceptibility decays as a power law and oscillates at $2 k_F$. As in the
high temperature analysis we find that a low density of impurities is not able
to explain the observed broadening of the lines. We are thus led to conclude
that there is more disorder in the system. We find that a large density of
point-like disorder gives broadening that is consistent with the experiment
down to about 5K, but that below this temperature additional mechanism is
likely needed.

set of objects studied only photometrically. The angular cross-correlation
between objects in a photometric sample with objects in some spectroscopic
sample as a function of the spectroscopic z, in combination with standard
correlation measurements, provides sufficient information to reconstruct the
true redshift distribution of the photometric sample. This technique enables
the robust calibration of photometric redshifts even beyond spectroscopic
limits. The spectroscopic sample need not resemble the photometric one in
galaxy properties, but must overlap in sky coverage and redshift range. We test
this new technique with Monte Carlo simulations using realistic error
estimates. RMS errors in recovering both the mean and sigma of the true,
Gaussian redshift distribution of a single photometric redshift bin are
1.4x10^(-3) (sigma_z/0.1) (Sigma_p/10)^(-0.3) (dN_s/dz / 25,000)^(-0.5), where
sigma_z is the true sigma of the redshift distribution, Sigma_p is the surface
density of the photometric sample in galaxies/arcmin^2, and dN_s/dz is the
number of galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift per unit z. We test the impact
of redshift outliers and of a variety of sources of systematic error; none
dominate measurement uncertainties in reasonable scenarios. With this method,
the true redshift distributions of even arbitrarily faint photometric redshift
samples may be determined to the precision required by proposed dark energy

find them to be overdense in two fields, underdense in two fields, and as dense
as the average density of GOODS in one field. The two excess fields show
significantly different color distributions from that of GOODS at the 99%

associated with the QSO. The distribution of $i_{775}$-dropout counts in the
five fields is broader than that derived from GOODS at the 80% to 96%
confidence level, depending on which selection criteria were adopted to
identify $i_{775}$-dropouts; its width cannot be explained by cosmic variance
alone. Thus, QSOs seem to affect their environments in complex ways. We suggest
the picture where the highest redshift QSOs are located in very massive
overdensities and are therefore surrounded by an overdensity of lower mass
halos. Radiative feedback by the QSO can in some cases prevent halos from
becoming galaxies, thereby generating in extreme cases an underdensity of
galaxies. The presence of both enhancement and suppression is compatible with
the expected differences between lines of sight at the end of reionization as
the presence of residual diffuse neutral hydrogen would provide young galaxies
with shielding from the radiative effects of the QSO.

gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at speeds up
to thousands of km/s. These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the
coevolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host
galaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always
assume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW
recoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences
of recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a
smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a
multi-component gaseous disk. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate onto
the SMBH as a function of time using a hybrid prescription of viscous
(alpha-disk) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks between 100 km/s
and the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander through the galaxy and halo for
about 1 Myr - 1 Gyr before settling back to the galactic center. However, the
mass accreted during this time is roughly constant at about 10% of the initial
mass, independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large
recoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil itself is
an effective means of regulating SMBH growth. Recoiling SMBHs may be observable
as spatially or kinematically offset quasars, but finding such systems could be
challenging, because the largest offsets correspond to the shortest quasar
lifetimes.

electromagnetic energy densities. Assuming the massive particles, with positive

the speed of light tends to zero. We assume the Universe to be closed over all

Unweighted coaddition of rapidly fading afterglow lightcurve data becomes
counterproductive relatively quickly. It is better to stop coaddition of the
data once noise dominates late exposures. A better alternative is to optimally
weight each exposure to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the final
coadded image data. By using information about GRB lightcurves and image noise
characteristics, optimal image coaddition increases the probability of
afterglow detection and places the most stringent upper limits on
non-detections. For a temporal power law flux decay typical of GRB afterglows,
optimal coaddition has the greatest potential to improve the S/N of afterglow
imaging data (relative to unweighted coaddition), when the decay rate is high,
the source count rate is low, and the background rate is high. The optimal
coaddition technique is demonstrated with applications to Swift

uniformly to the full wave train, from inspiral through ringdown. We emphasize
strong relationships among the $\ell=m$ modes that persist through the full

detailed analytic fitting of the late-time frequency evolution, identifying a
key quantitative feature shared by the $\ell=m$ modes among all mass ratios. We
identify relationships, with a simple interpretation in terms of the implicit
rotating source, among the evolution of frequency and amplitude, which hold for
the late-time radiation. These detailed relationships provide sufficient
information about the late-time radiation to yield a predictive model for the
late-time waveforms, an alternative to the common practice of modeling by a sum

published VAULT images of H L$\alpha$, a lower transition region line, with
near-contemporaneous magnetograms from Kitt Peak, obtained during the second
flight (VAULT-2) on 14 June 2002. The measured surface fields and potential
extrapolations suggest that there are too few short loops, and that L$\alpha$
emission is associated with the base regions of longer, coronal loops. VAULT-2
data of network boundaries have an asymmetry on scales larger than
supergranules, also indicating an association with long loops. We complement
the Kitt Peak data with very sensitive vector polarimetric data from the
Spectro-Polarimeter on board Hinode, to determine the influence of very small
magnetic concentrations on our analysis. From these data two classes of
behavior are found: within the cores of strong magnetic flux concentrations ($>
5\times10^{18}$ Mx) associated with active network and plage, small-scale mixed
fields are absent and any short loops can connect just the peripheries of the
flux to cell interiors. Core fields return to the surface via longer, most
likely coronal, loops. In weaker concentrations, short loops can connect
between concentrations and produce mixed fields within network boundaries as
suggested by Dowdy and colleagues. The VAULT-2 data which we examined are
associated with strong concentrations. We conclude that the cool loop model
applies only to a small fraction of the VAULT-2 emission, but we cannot
discount a significant role for cool loops in quieter regions. We suggest a
physical picture for how network L$\alpha$ emission may occur through the
cross-field diffusion of neutral atoms from chromospheric into coronal plasma.

and m single-antenna users, where L and m are typically of the same order. We
assume that only partial channel state information is available at the base
station through a finite rate feedback. Our key observation is that the optimal
number of on-users (users turned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and feedback rate. In support of this, an asymptotic analysis is
employed where L, m and the feedback rate approach infinity linearly. We derive
the asymptotic optimal feedback strategy as well as a realistic criterion to
decide which users should be turned on. The corresponding asymptotic throughput
per antenna, which we define as the spatial efficiency, turns out to be a
function of the number of on-users s, and therefore s must be chosen
appropriately. Based on the asymptotics, a scheme is developed for systems with
finite many antennas and users. Compared with other studies in which s is
presumed constant, our scheme achieves a significant gain. Furthermore, our
analysis and scheme are valid for heterogeneous systems where different users
may have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.

physical behaviours can be regarded as 'computing something' in the standard

reveal the presence of a stable photometric periodicity at P1=180.8 min which
is probably the orbital period of the underlying binary system. A second period
was present in the light curve of the object for six years. Shortly after the
nova eruption it was measured as P2=185.6 min. It has decreased monotonically
in the following few years reaching the value P2=183.9 min in 2003. In 2004 it
was no longer detectable. We suggest that the second periodicity is the spin of
the magnetic white dwarf of this system that rotates nearly synchronously with
the orbital revolution. According to our interpretation, the post-eruption
evolution of Nova V4633 Sgr follows a track similar to the one taken by V1500
Cyg (Nova Cygni 1975) after that nova eruption, on a somewhat longer time
scale. The asynchronism is probably the result of the nova outburst that lead
to a considerable expansion of the white dwarf's photosphere. The increase in
the moment of inertia of the star was associated with a corresponding decrease
in its spin rate. Our observations have followed the spinning up of the white
dwarf resulting from the contraction of its outer envelope as the star is
slowly retuning to its pre-outburst state. It is thus the second known
asynchronous polar classical nova.

implementing the weighted clique percolation method recently introduced by

the number of k-cliques in the network. As an example, the method is applied to

the properties of the elongated molecular complex that stretches about 2 kpc
southward from 30 Doradus. Our data suggests that the complex, which we refer
to as the ``molecular ridge,'' is not a coherent feature but consists of many
smaller clumps that share the same formation history. Likely molecular cloud
formation triggers are shocks and shearing forces that are present in the
surrounding south-eastern HI overdensity region, a region influenced by strong
ram pressure and tidal forces. The molecular ridge is at the western edge of
the the overdensity region where a bifurcated velocity structure transitions
into a single disk velocity component. We find that the 12CO(1-0) and HI
emission peaks in the molecular ridge are typically near each other but never
coincide. A likely explanation is the conversion of warmer, low-opacity HI to
colder, high-opacity HI from which H2 subsequently forms. On smaller scales, we
find that very dense molecular gas, as traced by interferometric HCO+ and HCN
maps, is associated with star formation along shocked filaments and with rims
of expanding shell-like structures, both created by feedback from massive

performed by Alice. The common bath interaction differentiates the outcome of
various Bell state measurements made by Alice. There will be a high fidelity
teleportation for a singlet measurement made by Alice when both the qubits of
Alice interact either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically with bath. In
contrast if one of the Alice's qubits interact ferromagnetically and the other
anti-ferromagnetically then measurement of Bell states belonging to the triplet
sector will give better fidelity. We have also evaluated the average fidelity
when Alice prefers non-maximally entangled states as her basis for measurement.

The positions and spectral indices of events with low-energy cutoff indicate
that such features are likely to be the result of photospheric albedo. It is
shown that if the isotropic albedo correction was applied, all low-energy
cutoffs in the mean electron spectrum were removed and hence the low energy
cutoffs in the mean electron spectrum of solar flares above $\sim$12 keV cannot
be viewed as real features in the electron spectrum. If low-energy cutoffs

chiral polytopes, with two purposes in mind: first, to survey the literature
about modular reduction in polytopes; and second, to apply modular reduction,
with moduli given by primes in Z[t] (with t=\tau the golden ratio), to
construct new regular 4-polytopes of hyperbolic types {3,5,3} and {5,3,5} with
automorphism groups given by finite orthogonal groups.

statistical mechanics. In our model a student of a simple perceptron learns
from not a true teacher directly, but ensemble teachers who learn from the true
teacher with a perceptron learning rule. Since the true teacher and the
ensemble teachers are expressed as non-monotonic perceptron and simple ones,
respectively, the ensemble teachers go around the unlearnable true teacher with
the distance between them fixed in an asymptotic steady state. The
generalization performance of the student is shown to exceed that of the
ensemble teachers in a transient state, as was shown in similar
ensemble-teachers models. Further, it is found that moving the ensemble
teachers even in the steady state, in contrast to the fixed ensemble teachers,
is efficient for the performance of the student.

Theor. 41, 312003 (2008)","10.1088/1751-8113/41/31/312003",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The maximum power of Feynman's ratchet as a heat engine and the corresponding
efficiency ($\eta_\ast$) are investigated by optimizing both the internal
parameter and the external load. When a perfect ratchet device (no heat
exchange between the ratchet and the paw via kinetic energy) works between two
thermal baths at temperatures $T_1> T_2$, its efficiency at maximum power is
found to be $\eta_\ast =\eta_C^2 /[\eta_C-(1-\eta_C)\ln(1-\eta_C)]$, where
$\eta_C\equiv 1-T_2/T_1$. This efficiency is slightly higher than the value
$1-\sqrt{T_2/T_1}$ obtained by Curzon and Ahlborn [\textit{Am. J. Phys.}
\textbf{43} (1975) 22] for macroscopic heat engines. It is also slightly larger
than the result $\eta_{SS}\equiv 2\eta_C/(4-\eta_C)$ obtained by Schmiedl and
Seifert [\textit{EPL} \textbf{81} (2008) 20003] for stochastic heat engines
working at small temperature difference, while the evident deviation between
$\eta_\ast$ and $\eta_{SS}$ appears at large temperature difference. For an
imperfect ratchet device in which the heat exchange between the ratchet and the
paw via kinetic energy is non-vanishing, the efficiency at maximum power
decreases with increasing the heat conductivity.
