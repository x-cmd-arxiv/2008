fermions using a Boltzmann approach. We include Coulomb interactions, a dilute
density of charged impurities and the presence of a magnetic field to describe
both the static and the low frequency response as a function of temperature T
and chemical potential mu. In the quantum-critical regime mu << T we find
pronounced deviations from Fermi liquid behavior, such as a collective
cyclotron resonance with an intrinsic, collision-broadened width, and
significant enhancements of the Mott and Wiedemann-Franz ratio. Some of these
results have been anticipated by a relativistic hydrodynamic theory, whose
precise range of validity and failure at large fields and frequencies we
determine. The Boltzmann approach allows us to go beyond the hydrodynamic
regime, and to quantitatively describe the deviations from
magnetohydrodynamics, the crossover to disorder dominated Fermi liquid behavior
at large doping and low temperatures, as well as the crossover to the ballistic
regime at high fields. Finally, we obtain the full frequency and doping
dependence of the single universal conductivity sigma_Q which parametrizes the
hydrodynamic response.

can become first order in the vicinity of a new ``Molecular'' phase, which
occurs in one of our models, but is continuous in a wide range of parameters

model where the Molecular phase is entirely absent, and a wide regime with a
continuous transition can be readily established. The two-component theory is
also an effective description of the hedgehog-suppressed O(3) universality, and
results are relevant for the recently discussed ``deconfined quantum

cosmological N-body simulations. We describe a perturbative treatment which
gives an approximation describing the evolution under self-gravity of a lattice
perturbed from its equilibrium, which allows to trace the evolution of the
fully discrete distribution until the time when particles approach one another
(""shell-crossing""). Perturbed lattices are typical initial conditions for
cosmological N-body simulations and thus we can describe precisely the early
time evolution of these simulations. A quantitative comparison with fluid
Lagrangian theory permits to study discreteness effects in the linear regime of
the simulations. We show finally some work in progress about quantifying
discreteness effects in the non-perturbative (highly non-linear) regime of
cosmological N-body simulations by evolving different discretizations of the
same continuous density field.

alive than ever. Direct observation of Anderson localization of electrons was
always hampered by interactions and finite temperatures. Yet, many theoretical
breakthroughs were made, highlighted by finite-size scaling, the
self-consistent theory and the numerical solution of the Anderson tight-binding
model. Theoretical understanding is based on simplified models or
approximations and comparison with experiment is crucial. Despite a wealth of
new experimental data, with microwaves, light, ultrasound and cold atoms, many
questions remain, especially for three dimensions. Here we report the first
observation of sound localization in a random three-dimensional elastic
network. We study the time-dependent transmission below the mobility edge, and
report ``transverse localization'' in three dimensions, which has never been
observed previously with any wave. The data are well described by the
self-consistent theory of localization. The transmission reveals non-Gaussian
statistics, consistent with theoretical predictions.

in precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, the observed relationship
between intraseasonal latent heat flux and precipitation anomalies in regions

performed with a small number of general circulation and idealized models.

the form of so called prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT).
Its main experimental prediction is violation of Born's rule which provides
only an approximative description of real probabilities. We expect that it will
be possible to design numerous experiments demonstrating violation of Born's
rule. Moreover, recently the first experimental evidence of violation was found
in the triple slits interference experiment, see \cite{WWW}. Although this
experimental test was motivated by another prequantum model, it can be
definitely considered as at least preliminary confirmation of the main
prediction of PCSFT. In our approach quantum particles are just symbolic
representations of ""prequantum random fields,"" e.g., ""electron-field"" or
""neutron-field""; photon is associated with classical random electromagnetic
field. Such prequantum fields fluctuate on time and space scales which are
essentially finer than scales of QM, cf. `t Hooft's attempt to go beyond QM
\cite{H1}--\cite{TH2}. In this paper we elaborate a detection model in the
PCSFT-framework. In this model classical random fields (corresponding to
""quantum particles"") interact with detectors inducing probabilities which match
with Born's rule only approximately. Thus QM arises from PCSFT as an
approximative theory. New tests of violation of Born's rule are proposed.

accommodate both prompt as well as late SNIa events, and can account for all

both single degenerate and double degenerate precursors may be able of

systematics effects on the SNIa properties with redshift.

against scalar field perturbations is analyzed. For a free massive scalar
field, the stability of the perturbation is guaranteed provided the squared
mass is bounded from below by a negative quantity. Depending on the base
manifold of the AdS asymptotics, this lower bound could be more stringent than
the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. An exact expression for the spectrum is found
analytically. For a scalar field perturbation with a nonminimal coupling, slow
fall-off asymptotic behavior is also allowed, provided the squared mass
fulfills certain negative upper bound. Although the Ricci scalar is not
constant, an exact expression for the spectrum of the scalar field can also be
found, and three different quantizations for the scalar field can be carried
out. They are characterized by the fall-off of the scalar field, which can be
fast or slow with respect to each asymptotic region. For these perturbations,
stability can be achieved in a range of negative squared masses which depends
on the base manifold of the AdS asymptotics. This analysis also extends to a
class of gravitational solitons with a single conformal boundary.

first-order but irreversible antiferromagnetic (AF)-insulating (I) to
ferromagnetic (FM)-metallic (M) transition in both and gives rise to soft FM

Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.975}$Al$_{0.025}$O$_3$ (PCMAO) is FM-M whereas that
of LCMO is AF-I. In both the systems the respective equilibrium phase coexists
with the other phase with contrasting order, which is not in equilibrium, and
the cooling field can tune the fractions of the coexisting phases. It is shown
earlier that the coexisting FM-M phase behaves like `magnetic glass' in LCMO.
Here we show from specially designed measurement protocols that the AF-I phase
of PCMAO has all the characteristics of magnetic glassy states. It devitrifies
on heating and also recrystallizes to equilibrium FM-M phase after annealing.
This glass-like AF-I phase also shows similar intriguing feature observed in
FM-M magnetic glassy state of LCMO that when the starting coexisting fraction
of glass is larger, successive annealing results in larger fraction of
equilibrium phase. This similarity between two manganite systems with
contrasting magnetic orders of respective glassy and equilibrium phases points
toward a possible universality.

adsorption is presented. The applied functionals include the gradient corrected
PBE and BLYP functional, and the corresponding hybrid Hartree-Fock density
functionals HSE and B3LYP. We find that PBE based hybrid functionals
(specifically HSE) yield, with the exception of Pt, the correct site order on
all considered metals, but they also considerably overestimate the adsorption
energies compared to experiment. On the other hand, the semi-local BLYP
functional and the corresponding hybrid functional B3LYP yield very
satisfactory adsorption energies and the correct adsorption site for all
surfaces. We are thus faced with a Procrustean problem: the B3LYP and BLYP
functionals seem to be the overall best choice for describing adsorption on
metal surfaces, but they simultaneously fail to account well for the properties
of the metal, vastly overestimating the equilibrium volume and underestimating
the atomization energies. Setting out from these observations, general
conclusions are drawn on the relative merits and drawbacks of various
semi-local and hybrid functionals. The discussion includes a revised version of
the PBE functional specifically optimized for bulk properties and surface
energies (PBEsol), a revised version of the PBE functional specifically
optimized to predict accurate adsorption energies (rPBE), as well as the
aforementioned BLYP functional. We conclude that no semi-local functional is
capable to describe all aspects properly, and including non-local exchange also
only improves some, but worsens other properties.

(ATCA). The results are complemented by infrared data from the Spitzer Space
Telescope. In CG30, the 3mm dust continuum images resolve two compact sources
with a separation of ~21.7 arcsecs (~8700 AU). In BHR71, strong dust continuum
emission is detected at the position of the mid-infrared source IRS1, while
only weak emission is detected from the secondary mid-infrared source IRS2.
Assuming optically thin 3mm dust continuum emission, we derive hydrogen gas
masses of 0.05--2.1 $M_\odot$ for the four sub-cores. N2H+(1-0) line emission
is detected in both CG30 and BHR71, and is spatially associated with the
thermal dust continuum emission. We derive the velocity fields and find
symmetric velocity gradients in both sources. Assuming that these gradients are
due to core rotation, we estimate the specific angular momenta and ratios of
rotational energy to gravitational energy for all cores. We also find that the
N2H+ emission is strongly affected by the outflows, both in terms of
entrainment and molecule destruction. $Spitzer$ images show the mid-infrared
emission from all four sub-cores. All four sources appear to drive their own
outflows. Based on the ATCA and $Spitzer$ observations, we construct spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) and derive temperatures and luminosities for all
cores. Based on the morphology and velocity structure, we suggest that the
sub-cores in CG30 were formed by initial fragmentation of a filamentary
prestellar core, while those in BHR71 could originate from rotational
fragmentation of a single collapsing protostellar core.

While radiative corrections can be calculated exactly in QED and to a good
accuracy also including hadronic corrections, these corrections cannot be
included into data analyses to arbitrary orders exactly. Nevertheless
consideration of multi-photon bremsstrahlung above the low-energy cut-off is
important for many (e,e'p) experiments. To date, higher-order bremsstrahlung
effects concerning electron scattering experiments have been implemented
approximately by employing the soft-photon approximation (SPA). In this paper
we propose a novel approach to multi-photon emission which partially removes
the SPA from (e,e'p) experiments. In this combined approach one hard photon is
treated exactly; and additional softer bremsstrahlung photons are taken into
account resorting to the soft-photon approximation. This partial removal of the
soft-photon approximation is shown to be relevant for the missing-energy
distribution for several kinematic settings at MAMI and TJNAF energies.
