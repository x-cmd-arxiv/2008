extrasolar planetary systems and predicts that systems rarely survive in a
resonant configuration. A growing number of systems are reported to be in
resonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. If
planets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced by
circumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets from
staying in a resonant configuration. This paper studies this process through
numerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approaches
include stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. We explore how the
amplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenance
of mean motion resonances. If turbulence is common in circumstellar disks
during the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by current
MHD simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motion
resonance are predicted to be rare. More specifically, the fraction of resonant
systems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 Myr is of order 0.01. If
mean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would place
tight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations in
circumstellar disks. These results can be combined by expressing the expected
fraction of surviving resonant systems in the approximate form P_b = C /
N_{orb}^{1/2}, where the dimensionless parameter C = 10 - 50 and where N_{orb}
is the number of orbits for which turbulence is active.

isomorphism classes of countably generated Hilbert modules over such algebras,
and to a similar classification for the closures of unitary orbits of
self-adjoint elements. We also obtain a structure theorem for the Cuntz
semigroup in this setting, and prove a conjecture of Blackadar and Handelman:
the lower semicontinuous dimension functions are weakly dense in the space of
all dimension functions. These results continue to hold in the broader setting
of unital simple ASH algebras with slow dimension growth and stable rank one.
Our main tool is a sharp bound on the radius of comparison of a recursive
subhomogeneous C*-algebra. This is also used to construct uncountably many
non-Morita-equivalent simple separable amenable C*-algebras with the same
K-theory and tracial state space, providing a C*-algebraic analogue of McDuff's
uncountable family of II_1 factors. We prove in passing that the range of the
radius of comparison is exhausted by simple C*-algebras.

three-dimensional galaxy surveys. Our method consists in measuring the relation
between the cosmological velocity and gravity fields, and thus requires
peculiar velocity measurements. The relation is measured *directly in redshift
space*, so there is no need to reconstruct the density field in real space. In
linear theory, the radial components of the gravity and velocity fields in
redshift space are expected to be tightly correlated, with a slope given, in
the distant observer approximation, by g / v = (1 + 6 beta / 5 + 3 beta^2 /
7)^(1/2) / beta. We test extensively this relation using controlled numerical
experiments based on a cosmological N-body simulation. To perform the
measurements, we propose a new and rather simple adaptive interpolation scheme
to estimate the velocity and the gravity field on a grid. One of the most
striking results is that nonlinear effects, including `fingers of God', affect
mainly the tails of the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of the
velocity and gravity field: the 1--1.5 sigma region around the maximum of the
PDF is *dominated by the linear theory regime*, both in real and redshift
space. This is understood explicitly by using the spherical collapse model as a
proxy of nonlinear dynamics. Applications of the method to real galaxy catalogs
are discussed, including a preliminary investigation on homogeneous (volume
limited) `galaxy' samples extracted from the simulation with simple
prescriptions based on halo and sub-structure identification, to quantify the
effects of the bias between the galaxy and the total matter distibution, and of
shot noise (ABRIDGED).

(WIMP) direct detection experiments depends on the underlying WIMP mass. We
study how the accuracy with which the WIMP mass could be determined by a single
direct detection experiment depends on the detector configuration and the WIMP
properties. We investigate the effects of varying the underlying WIMP mass and
cross-section, the detector target nucleus, exposure, energy threshold and
maximum energy, the local circular speed and the background event rate and
spectrum. The number of events observed is directly proportional to both the
exposure and the cross-section, therefore these quantities have the greatest
bearing on the accuracy of the WIMP mass determination. The relative
capabilities of different detectors to determine the WIMP mass depend not only
on the WIMP and target masses, but also on their energy thresholds. We find
that the rapid decrease of the nuclear form factor with increasing momentum
transfer which occurs for heavy nuclei, means that heavy nuclei will not
necessarily be able to measure the mass of heavy WIMPs more accurately.
Uncertainty in the local circular speed and non-negligible background would
both lead to systematic errors in the WIMP mass determination. With a single
detector it will be difficult to disentangle a WIMP signal (and the WIMP mass)
from background if the background spectrum has a similar shape to the WIMP
spectrum (i.e. exponential background, or flat background and a heavy WIMP).

object (black-hole or neutron star), and show relativistic outflows (or jets).
The matter that forms these jets is of likely stellar origin, previously
expelled from the star and trapped in the potential well of the compact object.
This matter is accreted by the compact object, forming a disk due to its
angular momentum, and is eventually ejected in the form of a bipolar outflow
(the jets), which generates radio emission and could also be a very high-energy
emitter. To study and understand the radiation from microquasars, there is a
set of elements that can play a major role and are to be taken into account:
the photons and the expelled matter from the star in the case of high-mass
systems; the accreted matter radiation; the jet; the magnetic field carried by
the jet or filling the binary system; and the medium surrounding the
microquasar at large scales (~pc). In this lecture, we consider these elements
of the microquasar scenario and briefly describe the physical conditions and
processes involved in the production of non-thermal radiation from radio to

several radiative mechanisms, and the impact of different photon absorption
processes, are discussed.

chain, interacting with a potential $u+V_n$ which the chain encounters when it
visits a special state 0 at time $n$. The disorder $(V_n)$ is a fixed
realization of an i.i.d. sequence. The polymer is pinned, i.e. the chain spends
a positive fraction of its time at state 0, when $u$ exceeds a critical value.
We assume that for the Markov chain in the absence of the potential, the
probability of an excursion from 0 of length $n$ has the form $n^{-c}\phi(n)$
with $c \geq 1$ and $\phi$ slowly varying. Comparing to the corresponding
annealed system, in which the $V_n$ are effectively replaced by a constant, it
is known that the quenched and annealed critical points differ at all
temperatures for $3/2<c<2$ and $c>2$, but only at low temperatures for $c<3/2$.
For high temperatures and $3/2<c<2$ we establish the exact order of the gap

$c=3/2$ we show that the gap is positive provided $\phi(n) \to 0$ as $n \to

role played by a hot intragroup medium (IGM) for the removal and destruction of
HI in these systems, we have performed a Chandra and XMM-Newton study of eight
of the most HI deficient Hickson compact groups. Diffuse X-ray emission
associated with an IGM is detected in four of the groups, suggesting that
galaxy-IGM interactions are not the dominant mechanism driving cold gas out of
the group members. No clear evidence is seen for any of the members being
currently stripped of any hot gas, nor for galaxies to show enhanced nuclear
X-ray activity in the X-ray bright or most HI deficient groups. Combining the
inferred IGM distributions with analytical models of representative disc
galaxies orbiting within each group, we estimate the HI mass loss due to ram
pressure and viscous stripping. While these processes are generally
insufficient to explain observed HI deficiencies, they could still be important
for HI removal in the X-ray bright groups, potentially removing more than half
of the ISM in the X-ray bright HCG 97. Ram pressure may also have facilitated
strangulation through the removal of galactic coronal gas. In X-ray undetected
groups, tidal interactions could be playing a prominent role, but it remains an
open question whether they can fully account for the observed HI deficiencies.

to ~12' (0.4 pc) from the star. The detected emission shows a ``head-tail''
morphology, but with complex substructure. Regions with detected HI emission
correlate with far-ultraviolet-luminous regions on large scales, but the two
tracers are not closely correlated on smaller scales (<1'). We propose that
detectable tails of HI are likely to be a common feature of red giants
undergoing mass-loss.

are two ways to describe the general properties of rotation curves, with very
different approaches concerning dark matter and gravity. Phenomenological
similarities between the two approaches are studied by looking for properties
predicted in one framework that are also reproducible in the other one. First,
we looked for the analogous of the URC within the MOND framework. Modifying in
an observationally-based way the baryonic contribution Vbar to the rotation
curve predicted by the URC, and applying the MOND formulas to this Vbar, leads
to a ""MOND URC"" whose properties are remarkably similar to the URC. Second, it
is shown that the URC predicts a tight mass discrepancy - acceleration
relation, which is a natural outcome of MOND. With the choice of Vbar that
minimises the differences between the URC and the ""MOND URC"" the relation is
almost identical to the observational one. This similarity between the
observational properties of MOND and the URC has no implications about the
validity of MOND as a theory of gravity, but it shows that it can reproduce in
detail the phenomenology of disk galaxies' rotation curves, as described by the
URC. MOND and the URC, even though they are based on totally different
assumptions, are found to have very similar behaviours and to be able to
reproduce each other's properties fairly well, even with the simple assumptions
made on the luminosity dependence of the baryonic contribution to the rotation
curve.

trajectories for the extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) TrES-4, XO-3b, and
HAT-P-1b. We factor in variations in atmospheric opacity, the presence of an
inner heavy-element core, and possible heating due to orbital tidal
dissipation. A small, yet non-zero, degree of core heating is needed to explain
the observed radius of TrES-4, unless its atmospheric opacity is significantly
larger than a value equivalent to that at 10$\times$solar metallicity with
equilibrium molecular abundances. This heating rate is reasonable, and
corresponds for an energy dissipation parameter ($Q_p$) of $\sim10^{3.8}$ to an
eccentricity of $\sim$0.01, assuming 3$\times$solar atmospheric opacity and a
heavy-element core of $M_c = 30$ $M_{\oplus}$. For XO-3b, which has an observed
orbital eccentricity of 0.26, we show that tidal heating needs to be taken into
account to explain its observed radius. Furthermore, we reexamine the core mass
needed for HAT-P-1b in light of new measurements and find that it now generally
follows the correlation between stellar metallicity and core mass suggested
recently. Given various core heating rates, theoretical grids and fitting
formulae for a giant planet's equilibrium radius and equilibration timescale
are provided for planet masses $M_p=$ 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 $M_J$ with $a =$
0.02-0.06 AU, orbiting a G2V star. When the equilibration timescale is much
shorter than that of tidal heating variation, the ``effective age'' of the
planet is shortened, resulting in evolutionary trajectories more like those of
younger EGPs. Motivated by the work of \citet{jackson08a,jackson08b}, we
suggest that this effect could indeed be important in better explaining some
observed transit radii.

we use different simulations to analyze the impact of HI fluctuations outside
the bubble on the detectability of the bubble. In the first three kinds of
simulations there is a spherical bubble of comoving radius R_b, the one that we
are trying to detect, located at the center, and the neutral hydrogen (HI)
outside the bubble traces the underlying dark matter distribution. We consider
three different possible scenarios of reionization, i.e., (i) there is a single
bubble (SB) in the field of view (FoV) and the hydrogen neutral fraction is
constant outside this bubble (ii) patchy reionization with many small ionized
bubbles in the FoV (PR1) and (iii) many spherical ionized bubbles of the same
radius $R_b$ (PR2). The fourth kind of simulation uses more realistic maps
based on semi-numeric modelling (SM) of ionized regions. We find that for both
the SB and PR1 scenarios the fluctuating IGM restricts bubble detection to size
R_b<= 6 Mpc and R_b<= 12 Mpc for the GMRT and the MWA respectively, however
large be the integration time. These results are well explained by analytical
predictions. Large uncertainty due to the HI fluctuations restricts bubble
detection in the PR2 scenario for neutral fraction x_HI<0.6. The matched-filter
technique works well even when the targeted ionized bubble is non-spherical due
to surrounding bubbles and inhomogeneous recombination (SM). We find that
determining the size and positions of the bubbles is not limited by the HI
fluctuations in the SB and PR1 scenario but limited by the instrument's angular
resolution instead, and this can be done more precisely for larger bubble
(abridged).

long-range interactions among the transverse components of the spins, on the
inhomogeneous periodic chain, is studied. The model, composed of $N$ segments
with $n$ different exchange interactions and magnetic moments, is exactly
solved by introducing the integral gaussian transformation and the generalized
Jordan-Wigner transformation, which reduce the problem to the diagonalization
of a finite matrix of $n$th order. The quantum transitions induced by the
transverse field are determined by analyzing the induced magnetization of the
cell and the equation of state. The phase diagrams for the quantum transitions,
in the space generated by the transverse field and the interaction parameters,
are presented. As expected, the model presents multiple, first- and
second-order quantum transitions induced by the transverse field, and it
corresponds to an extension of the models recently considered by the authors.
Detailed results are also presented, at T=0, for the induced magnetization and
isothermal susceptibility $\chi_{T}^{zz}$ as function of the transverse field.

sensitivity to the presence of low-mass planets orbiting the lens star,
including planets with masses as low as that of Earth. The essential
requirement for the detection of such planets in these events is that the FWHM
of the light curve be monitored continuously, or as nearly continuously as
possible. The dependence of planet detectability on the magnification caused by
microlensing, on the planet mass and planet location, and on the size of the
source star, may be understood in terms of simple geometrical properties of
microlensing that have been known since 1964. Planetary signals of low-mass
planets are found to be approximately independent of the magnification caused
by microlensing. This implies that planets can be detected in events over a
wide range of magnifications, from moderately high values ~ 100 to very high
values ~ 1000. The former values are likely to yield more clear-cut separations
of the stellar and planetary features on the light curve, but they require
larger telescopes to obtain precision photometry. During 2007, twenty-four
events with magnification exceeding 50 were detected by the MOA collaboration,
of which about half were also detected by the OGLE collaboration. A quarter of
the events received essentially continuous coverage of their FWHMs by follow-up
collaborations, another quarter received partial coverage, and the remaining
half received little coverage. Final analysis of these events is still
underway, but casual inspection of the light curves reveals some possible
planetary detections amongst them. During 2008 it is hoped that fuller coverage
of events of high magnification will be obtained with the addition of further
telescopes to existing follow-up networks.

then recapitulate as to why the Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum
mechanics had to renounce most of the attractive features of the clasical world
view such as a causal description, locality, scientific realism and introduce a
fundamental distinction between system and apparatus. The crucial role is
played in this by the Bohr's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most
complete description possible for an even individual system. The alternative of
introducing extra dynamical variables, called hidden variables, in addition to
the wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the
desirable features of classical physics, is then explored. The first such
successful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic
interpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal
description as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus
differently. We begin with the construction of the Bohm's theory. He introduces
particle positions as the hidden variables. The particle positions play a
special role in Bohm theory. The particle trajectories are guided by the
wavefunction. The Bohm theory is deterministic. The probability enters through
a special assumption, ``quantum equilibrium'' hypothesis, for the initial
conditions on the ensemble of particle trajectories. The ``wave or particle''
dilemma is resolved by a ``wave and particle'' resolution. The measurements in
Bohm theory can be described without mysticism. Bohm's theory is however
nonlocal.

(i) point particles, (ii) aether, (iii) absolute space and (iv) absolute time.
The electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and Faraday introduced `fields' as a new
ontological entity not reducible to earlier ones. Their work also unified
electricity, magnetism and optics. Repeated failure to observe the motion of
earth through aether led Einstein to modify the Newtonian absolute space and
time concepts to a fused Minkowski space-time and the removal of aether from
basic ontological entities in his special theory of relativity. Later Einstein
in his attempts to give a local theory of gravitation was led to further modify
flat Minkowski space-time to the curved Riemannian space time. This reduced
gravitational phenomenon to that of geometry of the space time. Space-time,
matter and fields all became dynamical. We also abstract some general features
of description of nature in classical physics and enquire whether these could
be features of any scientific description?

such as the solar corona the total magnetic helicity of a force-free field must
be bounded and the accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of its upper
bound would initiate a non-equilibrium situation resulting in an expulsion such
as a coronal mass ejection (CME). In the current paper, we investigate the
dependence of the helicity bound on the boundary condition for several families
of nonlinear force-free fields. Our calculation shows that the magnitude of the
helicity upper bound of force-free fields is non-trivially dependent on the
boundary condition. Fields with a multipolar boundary condition can have a
helicity upper bound ten times smaller than those with a dipolar boundary
condition when helicity values are normalized by the square of their respective
surface poloidal fluxes. This suggests that a coronal magnetic field may erupt
into a CME when the applicable helicity bound falls below the already
accumulated helicity as the result of a slowly changing boundary condition. Our
calculation also shows that a monotonic accumulation of magnetic helicity can
lead to the formation of a magnetic flux rope applicable to kink instability.
This suggests that CME initiations by exceeding helicity bound and by kink
instability can both be the consequences of helicity accumulation in the
corona. Our study gives insights into the observed associations of CMEs with
the magnetic features at their solar surface origins.

and proven to be finite independently by Ole Romer and Bradley in the
eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, Fizeau carried out the first
successful measurement of the speed of light using an earthbound apparatus.
Thereafter, many earthbound experiments were conducted for its determination

Einstein considered the speed of light derived from terrestrial experiments, to

with his general relativity theory that light rays could curve only when the
velocity of propagation of light varies with position. Experiments have been
conducted to prove the phenomenon of light deflection to higher and higher
accuracy levels, but none so far to determine the speed of light at locations
closer to the sun. To verify some essential aspects of general relativity, NASA

inflationary period is analyzed in the framework of the braneworld models, in
which our Universe is a three-brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk, by
assuming the possibility of the brane-bulk energy exchange. The inflaton field
is assumed to decay into normal matter only, while the dark matter is injected
into the brane from the bulk. To describe the reheating process we adopt a
phenomenological approach, by describing the decay of the inflaton field by a
friction term proportional to the energy density of the field. After the
radiation dominated epoch the model reduces to the standard four dimensional
cosmological model. The modified field equations are analyzed analytically and
numerically in both the extra-dimensions dominate reheating phase (when the
quadratic terms in energy density dominate the dynamics), and in the general
case. The evolution profiles of the matter, of the scalar field and of the
scale factor of the universe are obtained for different values of the
parameters of the model, and of the equations of state of the normal and dark
matter, respectively. The equation describing the time evolution of the ratio
of the energy density of the dark and of the normal matter is also obtained.
The ratio depends on the rate of the energy flow between the bulk and the
brane. The observational constraint of an approximately constant ratio of the
dark and of the baryonic matter requires that the dark matter must be
non-relativistic (cold). The model predicts a reheating temperature of the
order of $3\times 10^6$ GeV, a brane tension of the order of $10^{25}$ GeV$^4$,
and the obtained composition of the universe is consistent with the
observational data.

periastron passage of an (as yet) unseen companion in a highly eccentric
($\epsilon \sim 0.9$) orbit. This paper presents three-dimensional (3-D)
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the orbital variation of
the binary wind-wind collision, and applies these to modeling the X-ray light
curve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). By providing a global
3-D model of the phase variation of the density of the interacting winds, the
simulations allow computation of the associated variation in X-ray absorption,
presumed here to originate from near the apex of the wind-wind interaction
cone. We find that the observed RXTE light curve can be readily fit if the
observer's line of sight is within this cone along the general direction of
apastron. Specifically, the data are well fit by an assumed inclination $i =
45^{\circ}$ for the orbit's polar axis, which is thus consistent with orbital
angular momentum being along the inferred polar axis of the Homunculus nebula.
The fits also constrain the position angle $\phi$ that an orbital-plane
projection makes with the apastron side of the semi-major axis, strongly
excluding positions $\phi < 9^{\circ}$ along or to the retrograde side of the
axis, with the best fit position given by $\phi = 27^{\circ}$. Overall the
results demonstrate the utility of a fully 3-D dynamical model for constraining
the geometric and physical properties of this complex colliding-wind binary

Lissajous curves by a chaotic dynamics. Our analysis shows that by using a
sufficient amount of training data, balanced with the network memory capacity,
it is possible to satisfy the conditions for embedding the target stochastic
sequences into a chaotic dynamical system. It is also shown that reconstruction
of a stochastic time series by a chaotic model can be stabilized by adding a
negligible amount of noise to the dynamics of the model.

  Very recently Averkov and Bianchi [AB] have confirmed Matheron's conjecture
on the covariogram problem, that asserts that any planar convex body K is
determined by the knowledge of g_{K,K}.
  The problem of determining the sets from their covariogram is relevant in
probability, in statistical shape recognition and in the determination of the
atomic structure of a quasicrystal from X-ray diffraction images.
  We prove that when K and L are convex polygons (and also when K and L are
planar convex cones) g_{K,L} determines both K and L, up to a described family
of exceptions. These results imply that, when K and L are in these classes, the
information provided by the cross covariogram is so rich as to determine not
only one unknown body, as required by Matheron's conjecture, but two bodies,
with a few classified exceptions.

thanks to the monitoring of the Galactic plane performed with the INTEGRAL
satellite in the last 5 years. These sources display short outbursts
(significantly shorter than typical Be/X-ray binaries) with a peak luminosity
of a few 1E36 erg/s. The quiescent level, measured only in a few sources, is
around 1E32 erg/s. We are performing a monitoring campaign with Swift of four
SFXTs (IGRJ16479-4514, XTEJ1739-302, IGRJ17544-2619 and
AXJ1841.0-0536/IGRJ18410-0535). We report on the first four months of Swift
observations, started on 2007 October 26. We detect a low level X-ray activity
in all four SFXTs which demonstrates that these transient sources accrete
matter even outside their outbursts. This fainter X-ray activity is composed of
many flares with a large flux variability, on timescales of thousands of
seconds. The lightcurve variability is also evident on larger timescales of
days, weeks and months, with a dynamic range of more than one order of
magnitude in all four SFXTs. The X-ray spectra are typically hard, with an
average 2-10 keV luminosity during this monitoring of about 1E33-1E34 erg/s. We
detected pulsations from the pulsar AXJ1841.0-0536, with a period of
4.7008+/-0.0004 s. This monitoring demonstrates that these transients spend
most of the time accreting matter, although at a much lower level (~100-1000
times lower than during the bright outbusts), and that the true quiescence,
characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 1E32 erg/s, observed
in the past only in a couple of members of this class, is probably a very rare
state.

gamma-ray flux expected from a population of MSPs in 47 Tucanae. These MSPs
produce gamma-rays in their magnetospheres via accelerated electron primaries
which are moving along curved magnetic field lines. A GC like 47 Tucanae
containing a large number of MSPs provides the opportunity to study a
randomized set of pulsar geometries. Geometry-averaged spectra make the testing
of the underlying pulsar model more reliable, since in this case the relative
flux uncertainty is reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the variation
expected for individual pulsars (if the number of visible pulsars N=100). Our
predicted spectra violate the EGRET upper limit at 1 GeV, constraining the
product of the number of visible pulsars N and the average integral flux above
1 GeV per pulsar. GLAST/LAT should place even more stringent constraints on
this product, and may also limit the maximum average accelerating potential by
probing the CR spectral tail. For N=22-200, a GLAST/LAT non-detection will lead
to the constraints that the average integral flux per pulsar should be lower by
factors 0.03-0.003 than current model predictions.

Parameter B determines residual quadrupolar deformation due to the crustal
shear strain, in a neutron star that spun-down to a non-rotating state. The
calculations of A are based on precise numerical 2-D calculations for rotating
neutron stars with realistic equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter. An
approximate, but quite precise, formula for B is used, which allows us to
separate the contribution of the crust from the dependence on the stellar mass
M and radius R. The elastic shear strain distribution within the crust is
modeled following Cutler et al. (2003). A(M) and B(M) are calculated for
0.2Msun < M < 0.9M_max for seven EOSs of neutron star core, combined with
several crust models. A standard formula based on the incompressible fluid

nearly EOS independent and are given (within a few percent) by a universal

low and high metallicity tails of the thin disc are populated by objects which
orbital properties suggest an origin in the outer and inner galactic disc,
respectively. Signatures of radial migration are identified in various recent
samples, and are shown to be responsible for the high metallicity dispersion in
the age-metallicity distribution. Most importantly, it is shown that the
population of low metallicity wanderers of the thin disc (-0.7<[Fe/H]<-0.3 dex)
is also responsible for the apparent hiatus in metallicity with the thick disc
(which terminal metallicity is about -0.2 dex). It implies that the thin disc
at the solar circle has started to form stars at about this same metallicity.
This is also consistent with the fact that 'transition' objects, which have
alpha-element abundance intermediate between that of the thick and thin discs,
are found in the range [-0.4,-0.2] dex. Once the metal-poor thin disc stars are
recognised for what they are - wanderers from the outer thin disc - the
parenthood between the two discs can be identified on stars genuinely formed at
the solar circle through an evolutionary sequence in [alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H] .
Another consequence is that stars that can be considered as truly resulting of
the chemical evolution at the solar circle have a metallicity restricted to
about [-0.2,+0.2] dex, confirming an old idea that most chemical evolution in
the Milky Way have preceded the thin disc formation.

pressure-overlapping transitions. The first transition starts at P > 1 GPa and
proceeds without any changes in thecoordination number of the boron atoms; the
other one starts at P > 5 GPa and is accompanied by a gradual increase of
coordination number. The second transition is completely reversible; the
residual densification of the B2O3 glass after decompression is associated with
the incomplete reversibility of the first transformation. The fraction of boron
atoms transferred to the 4-coordination state in the glass at P < 10 GPa is
much smaller than was assumed from indirect experimental data [4], but is
considerably larger (by tens of times) than was previously suggested by the
classical molecular dynamics simulations [5,6]. The observed transformations
under both compression and decompression are quite broad, contrary to the
assumption in Ref. [7]. On the basis of ab-initio results, we also predict the
one more transformation under higher pressures to a super-dense phase, in which
B atoms become 5- and 6-fold coordinated.

have modelled the extragalactic optical and IR backgrounds using available
information on cosmic sources in the universe from far-UV to sub-mm wavelengths
over a wide range of cosmic epochs. We have exploited the relevant cosmological
survey data - including number counts, redshift distributions, luminosity
functions - from ground-based observatories in the optical, near-IR, and
sub-mm, as well as multi-wavelength information coming from space telescopes,
HST, ISO and Spitzer. Additional constraints have been used from direct
measurements or upper limits on the extragalactic backgrounds by dedicated
missions (COBE). All data were fitted and interpolated with a multi-wavelength
backward evolutionary model, allowing us to estimate the background photon
density and its redshift evolution. From the redshift-dependent background
spectrum, the photon-photon opacities for sources of high-energy emission at
any redshifts were then computed. The same results can also be used to compute
the optical depths for any kind of processes in the intergalactic space

continuous measurement and control process, and finally, projection of the
trajectory onto a state-space manifold having reduced dimensionality and
possessing a Kahler potential of multi-linear form. The resulting simulation

simulated, having no spatial symmetry and no spatial ordering; the
high-fidelity projection of numerically computed quantum trajectories onto
low-dimensionality Kahler state-space manifolds is demonstrated. The
reconstruction of quantum trajectories from sparse random projections is
demonstrated, the onset of Donoho-Stodden breakdown at the Candes-Tao sparsity

particular, we explore the sensitivity of the element creation in the A>130
region to the low-temperature behavior of the outflows. For this purpose we
employ a simplified model of the dynamics and thermodynamical evolution for
radiation dominated, adiabatic outflows. It consists of a first stage of fast,
exponential cooling, followed by a second phase of slower evolution, either
assuming constant density and temperature or a power-law decay of these
quantities. These cases are supposed to capture the most relevant effects of a
strong deceleration or decreasing acceleration of the transsonic outflows,
respectively, e.g. in a wind termination shock caused by the collision with the
slower, preceding supernova ejecta. We find that not only the transition
temperature between the two expansion phases can make a big difference in the
formation of the platinum peak, but also the detailed cooling law during the
later phase. Unless the transition temperature and corresponding (free neutron)
density become too small (T < 2*10^8 K), a lower temperature or faster
temperature decline during this phase allow for a stronger appearance of the
third abundance peak. Since the nuclear photodisintegration rates between
~2*10^8 K and ~10^9 K are more sensitive to the temperature than the n-capture
rates are to the free neutron density, a faster cooling in this temperature
regime shifts the r-process path closer to the n-drip line. With low (gamma,n)-
but high beta-decay rates, the r-processing then does not proceed through a
(gamma,n)-(n,gamma) equilibrium but through a quasi-equilibrium of
(n,gamma)-reactions and beta-decays, as recently also pointed out by Wanajo.

  We concentrate on the different types of interaction between the inflowing
wind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when accretion
of matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these include the
inhibition through the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. Expanding on earlier
work, we calculate the expected luminosity for each regime and derive the
conditions under which transition from one regime to another can take place. We
show that very large luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as short
as hours) can result from transitions across different regimes.
  The activity displayed by supergiant fast X-ray transients, a recently
discovered class of high mass X-ray binaries in our galaxy, has often been
interpreted in terms of direct accretion onto a neutron star immersed in an
extremely clumpy stellar wind. We show here that the transitions across the
magnetic and/or centrifugal barriers can explain the variability properties of
these sources as a results of relatively modest variations in the stellar wind
velocity and/or density. According to this interpretation we expect that
supergiant fast X-ray transients which display very large luminosity swings and
host a slowly spinning neutron star are characterized by magnetar-like fields,
irrespective of whether the magnetic or the centrifugal barrier applies.
  Supergiant fast X-ray transients might thus provide a new opportunity to
detect and study magnetars in binary systems.

differs from the structure of crystalline NaFeSi2O6, which contains only
octahedral Fe3+. The EPSR modeling of glass structure shows that [4]Fe3+ is

tetrahedra. The existence of a majority of [4]Fe3+ sites differs from the
structure of the corresponding crystalline phase, which contains only
octahedral Fe3+. The network-forming behavior of [4]Fe3+, coupled with the
presence of Na+ ions acting as charge-compensators, is at the origin of
peculiar physical properties of Fe-bearing glasses, such as the increase of the
elastic modulus of sodium silicate glasses with increasing Fe-concentration.
Our data provide also direct evidence for 5-coordinated Fe, with an average

segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that
minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with

methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the

that no major medium modifications in the Delta(1232) properties are needed in

of rocky planets similar to the Earth at mid-infrared wavelengths (6 - 20
micron), where an advantageous contrast ratio between star and planet occurs.
The baseline mission lasts 5 years and consists of approximately 200 individual
target stars. Among these, 25 to 50 planetary systems can be studied
spectroscopically, searching for gases such as CO2, H2O, CH4 and O3. Many of
the key technologies required for the construction of Darwin have already been
