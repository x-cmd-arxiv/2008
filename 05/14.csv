different initial configurations quickly evolve towards the same long-time

applications, GNSS-R, has been a research area of interest for more than a
decade. One of the possible applications of this technique is soil moisture
monitoring. The retrieval of soil moisture with GNSS-R systems is based on the
variability of the ground dielectric properties associated to soil moisture.
Higher concentrations of water in the soil yield a higher dielectric constant
and reflectivity, which incurs in signals that reflect from the Earth surface
with higher peak power. Previous investigations have demonstrated the
capability of GPS bistatic scatterometers to obtain high enough signal to noise
ratios in order to sense small changes in surface reflectivity. Furthermore,
these systems present some advantages with respect to others currently used to
retrieve soil moisture. Upcoming satellite navigation systems, such as the
European Galileo, will represent an excellent source of opportunity for soil
moisture remote sensing for various reasons. First, the existence of pilot
signals will provide the possibility to extend coherent integration times,
which will contribute to the increase of received signals SNR. In addition, the
availability of Galileo L1 and L5 signals will allow the multi-spectral
analysis of the reflected signals and the development of inversion models which
will be able to account more precisely for adverse effects, such as surface
roughness and vegetation canopy. In this paper we present some of the recent
theoretical work and experiments carried out at Starlab focusing on the
development of dedicated Soil Moisture GNSS-R systems.

directly in the resummed cross section at next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), and
we find that the first-order expansion of the NLL resummed charge asymmetry
reproduces the known fixed-order result for the asymmetry well. Beyond its
lowest order, the asymmetric component of the cross section is enhanced by the
same leading-logarithmic threshold corrections as the total cross section. As a
result, the charge asymmetry is robust with respect to the higher-order
perturbative corrections generated by threshold resummation. We observe that
the asymmetry increases with pair mass and with scattering angle.

states of a strongly-coupled scale-invariant theory, where scale-invariance
implies that the confined states have continuous masses. This picture is
consistent with the observation that unparticle operators can be represented in
terms of continuous mass fields. Finite results in scattering processes are
obtained by compensating the infinite number of unparticle final states with an
infinitesimal coupling per unparticle. As a result, unparticles are stable with
respect to decay or annihilation to Standard Model particles, implying a
one-way flow of energy from the Standard Model sector to the unparticle sector.
The qualitative properties of unparticles, which result from their continuous
mass nature, are unchanged in the case where scale-invariance is broken by a
mass gap. Unparticles with a mass gap can evade constraints from astrophysical
and 5th force considerations, in which case cosmology provides the strongest
constraints.

accretion of matter onto a central protostar with the ejection of molecular
outflows that can affect the surrounding medium. The impact of a supersonic
outflow on the ambient gas can produce a strong shock that could accelerate
particles up to relativistic energies. A strong evidence of this has been the
detection of non-thermal radio emission coming from the jet termination region
of some young massive stars. In the present contribution, we study the possible
high-energy emission due to the interaction of relativistic particles,
electrons and protons, with the magnetic, photon and matter fields inside a
giant molecular cloud. Electrons lose energy via relativistic Bremsstrahlung,
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton interactions, and protons cool mainly
through inelastic collisions with atoms in the cloud. We conclude that some
massive young stellar objects might be detectable at gamma-rays by next
generation instruments, both satellite-borne and ground based.

calculations. It is shown that the calculated cross sections are sensitive to
the couplings to the $2^+$ and $3^-$ excitation channels even at low energies,
where these channels are closed. The sensitivity to the ion-ion potential is
investigated by applying a conventional Woods-Saxon potential and the
M3Y+repulsion potential, consisting of the M3Y double-folding potential and a
repulsive term that simulates the effect of the nuclear incompressibility. The
best overall fit to the data is obtained with a M3Y+repulsion potential which
produces a shallow potential in the entrance channel. The stepwise increase in
measured fusion cross sections at high energies is also consistent with such a
shallow potential. The steps are correlated with overcoming the barriers for
the angular momenta $L$ = 12, 14, 16, and 18. To improve the fit to the
low-energy data requires a shallower potential and this causes a even stronger
hindrance of fusion at low energies. It is therefore difficult, based on the
existing fusion data, to make an accurate extrapolation to energies that are of
interest to astrophysics.

within the laws of physics as we know them (the Standard Model, or SM), none of

there are high hopes that DM particles, along with their associated new matter

We use a set of simulations that cover 5 decades in halo mass ranging from the
scales of dwarf galaxies (V_c ~30 km/s) to clusters of galaxies (V_c ~ 1000
km/s). We find that the concentration mass relation is a power law in all three
cosmologies. However the slope is shallower and the zero point is lower moving
from WMAP1 to WMAP5 to WMAP3. For haloes of mass log(M_200/Msun) = 10, 12, and
14 the differences in the concentration parameter between WMAP1 and WMAP3 are a
factor of 1.55, 1.41, and 1.29, respectively. As we show, this brings the
central densities of dark matter haloes in good agreement with the central
densities of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies inferred from their
rotation curves, for both the WMAP3 and WMAP5 cosmologies. We also show that
none of the existing toy models for the concentration-mass relation can
reproduce our simulation results over the entire range of masses probed. In
particular, the model of Bullock et al (B01) fails at the higher mass end (M >
1e13 Msun), while the NFW model of Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) fails
dramatically at the low mass end (M < 1e12 Msun). We present a new model, based
on a simple modification of that of B01, which reproduces the
concentration-mass relations in our simulations over the entire range of masses
probed (1e10 Msun < M < 1e15 Msun). Haloes in the WMAP3 cosmology (at a fixed
mass) are more flatted compared to the WMAP1 cosmology, with a medium to long
axis ration reduced by ~10 %. Finally, we show that the distribution of halo
spin parameters is the same for all three cosmologies.

transiting Neptune-mass planet GJ 436b and at the same time satisfy various
observational constraints and anomalies, Ribas, Font-Ribera and Beaulieu have
proposed the existence of an eccentric low-mass companion planet at the
position of the outer 2:1 resonance. The authors demonstrate the viability of
their proposal using point-mass three-body integrations, arguing that as long
as the system appears to be dynamically stable, the short-term secular
variations ought to dominate the long-term dissipative evolution. Here we
demonstrate that if one includes tidal dissipation, both orbits circularize
after a few times the circularization timescale of the inner planet. We
conclude that with or without a nearby companion planet, in or out of the 2:1
resonance, the Q-value of GJ 436b must be near the upper bound estimate for
Neptune if the system is as young as 1 Gyr, and an order of magnitude higher if
the system is as old as 10 Gyr. We show detail of passage through resonance and
conclude that even out of resonance, a companion planet should still be
detectable through transit timing variations.

gas accretion during merger-driven starbursts and mergers with other BHs, (ii)
accretion during starbursts triggered by disc instabilities, and (iii)
accretion of gas cooled from quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes. It is assumed
that feedback from AGN operates in the later case. The model has been
calibrated in order to reproduce observational correlations between BH mass and
mass, velocity dispersion, and absolute magnitudes of the galaxy bulge. AGN
feedback has a strong impact on reducing or even suppressing gas cooling, an
effect that becomes important at lower redshifts. This phenomenon helps to
reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function (LF) in the optical and near
IR bands at z=0, and the cosmic star formation rate and stellar mass functions
over a wide redshift range (0<z<5). It also allows to have a population of
massive galaxies already in place at z>1, which are mostly early-type and have
older and redder stellar populations than lower mass galaxies, reproducing the
observed bimodality in the galaxy colour distribution, and the morphological
fractions. The evolution of the optical QSO LF is also reproduced, provided
that the presence of a significant fraction of obscured QSOs is assumed. We
explore the effects of AGN feedback during starbursts and new recent

external Compton scattering of the electrons with the photon field of the Broad
Line Region. Within this scenario the excess emission in the soft-X ray band
can be interpreted as due to Bulk Compton radiation of cold electrons. However,
some other processes, briefly discussed in the text, can also reproduce the

minutes, thus implicating the solar p modes as a possible source. We
investigate the generation of tube waves within the solar convection zone by
the buffeting of p modes. The tube waves--in the form of longitudinal sausage
waves and transverse kink waves--are generated on the many magnetic fibrils
that lace the convection zone and pierce the solar photosphere. Once generated
by p-mode forcing, the tube waves freely propagate up and down the tubes, since
the tubes act like light fibers and form a waveguide for these magnetosonic
waves. Those waves that propagate upward pass through the photosphere and enter
the upper atmosphere where they can be measured as loop oscillations and other
forms of propagating coronal waves. We treat the magnetic fibrils as vertically
aligned, thin flux tubes and compute the energy flux of tube waves that can
generated and driven into the upper atmosphere. We find that a flux in excess
of 10^5 ergs/cm^2/s can be produced, easily supplying enough wave energy to
explain the observations. Furthermore, we compute the associated damping rate
of the driving p modes and find that the damping is significant compared to
observed line widths only for the lowest order p modes.

for the time concept in cosmology. We discuss and defend the idea that the
physical basis of the time concept is necessarily related to physical processes
which could conceivably take place among the material constituents available in
the universe. It is common practice to link the concept of cosmic time with a
space-time metric set up to describe the universe at large scales, and then
define a cosmic time $t$ as what is measured by a comoving standard clock. We
want to examine, however, the physical basis for setting up a comoving
reference frame and, in particular, what could be meant by a standard clock.
For this purpose we introduce the concept of a `core' of a clock (which, for a
standard clock in cosmology, is a scale-setting physical process) and we ask if
such a core can--in principle--be found in the available physics contemplated
in the various `stages' of the early universe. We find that a first problem
arises above the quark-gluon phase transition (which roughly occurs when the
cosmological model is extrapolated back to $\sim 10^{-5}$ seconds) where there
might be no bound systems left, and the concept of a physical length scale to a
certain extent disappears. A more serious problem appears above the electroweak
phase transition believed to occur at $\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds. At this point
the property of mass (almost) disappears and it becomes difficult to identify a
physical basis for concepts like length scale, energy scale and temperature --
which are all intimately linked to the concept of time in modern cosmology.
This situation suggests that the concept of a time scale in `very early'
universe cosmology lacks a physical basis or, at least, that the time scale
will have to be based on speculative new physics.

emerging field of ``atomtronics'' promises a new generation of nanoscale
devices. It is therefore of fundamental and technological importance to
understand their dynamical properties. Here we study the outgoing atomic flux
of BECs loaded in an one-dimensional OL with leaking edges, using a mean field
description provided by the Discrete Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation (DNLSE).
We demonstrate that the atom population inside the OL decays in avalanches of
size $J$. For intermediate values of the interatomic interaction strength their
distribution ${\cal P}(J)$ follows a power law i.e. ${\cal
P}(J)\sim1/J^{\alpha}$ characterizing systems at phase transition. This scale
free behaviour of ${\cal P}(J)$ reflects the complexity and the hierarchical
structure of the underlying classical mixed phase space. Our results are
relevant in a variety of contexts (whenever DNLSE is adequate), most
prominently the light emmitance from coupled non-linear optics waveguides.

Array of two molecular clouds. The impetus for these observations is a search
for synchrotron radiation by cosmic ray secondary electrons/positrons in a
region of enhanced density and possibly high magnetic field. We present
modelling which shows that there should be an appreciable flux of synchrotron
above the more diffuse, galactic synchrotron background.
  The starless core G333.125-0.562 and infrared source IRAS 15596-5301 were
observed at 1384 and 2368 MHz. For G333.125-0.562, we find no significant
levels of radio emission from this source at either frequency, nor any
appreciable polarisation: we place an upper limit on the radio continuum flux
from this source of 0.5 mJy per beam at both 1384 and 2368 MHz. Due to the
higher than expected flux density limits, we also obtained archival ATCA data
at 8640 MHz for this cloud and place an upper limit on the flux density of 50
micro-Jy per beam. Assuming the cosmic ray spectrum is similar to that near the
Sun, and given the cloud's molecular density and mass, we place an upper limit
on the magnetic field of 500 micro-G. IRAS 15596-5301, with an RMS of 50
micro-Jy per beam at 1384 MHz, shows an HII region consistent with optically
thin free-free emission already detected at 4800 MHz. We use the same
prescription as G333 to constrain the magnetic field from this cloud to be less
than 500 micro-G. We find that these values are not inconsistent with the view
that magnetic field values scale with the average density of the molecular
cloud.

(PS), foreground background processor sharing (FBPS) and shortest remaining

size of a customer arriving in stationarity is smaller than exactly k>=0 out of
the preceding m>=k arrivals. Then, conditioning on the preceding event, the
sojourn time distribution of this newly arriving customer behaves
asymptotically the same as if the customer were served in isolation with a
server of rate (1-\rho)/(k+1) for PS/FBPS, and (1-\rho) for SRPT, respectively,
where \rho is the traffic intensity. Hence, the introduced notion of
conditional limits allows us to distinguish the asymptotic performance of the
studied schedulers by showing that SRPT exhibits considerably better asymptotic
behavior for relatively smaller jobs than PS/FBPS.
  Inspired by the preceding results, we propose an approximation to the SRPT
discipline based on a novel adaptive job grouping mechanism that uses relative
size comparison of a newly arriving job to the preceding m arrivals.
Specifically, if the newly arriving job is smaller than k and larger than m-k
of the previous m jobs, it is routed into class k. Then, the classes of smaller
jobs are served with higher priorities using the static priority scheduling.
The good performance of this mechanism, even for a small number of classes m+1,
is demonstrated using the asymptotic queueing analysis under the heavy-tailed
job requirements. We also discuss refinements of the comparison grouping
mechanism that improve the accuracy of job classification at the expense of a
small additional complexity.

detected this source first in late July, and then in November-December 2007. In
this letter we present the multifrequency data collected by the WEBT and
collaborators during the second AGILE observing period, complemented by a few
contemporaneous data from UVOT onboard the Swift satellite. The aim is to trace
in detail the behaviour of the synchrotron emission from the blazar jet, and to
investigate the contribution from the thermal emission component. Optical data
from about twenty telescopes have been homogeneously calibrated and carefully
assembled to construct an R-band light curve containing about 1340 data points
in 42 days. This extremely well-sampled optical light curve allows us to follow
the dramatic flux variability of the source in detail. In addition, we show
radio-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at different epochs, which
represent different brightness levels. In the considered period, the source
varied by 2.6 mag in a couple of weeks in the R band. Many episodes of fast
(i.e. intranight) variability were observed, most notably on December 12, when
a flux increase of about 1.1 mag in 1.5 hours was detected, followed by a steep
decrease of about 1.2 mag in 1 hour. The contribution by the thermal component
is difficult to assess, due to the uncertainties in the Galactic, and possibly
also intrinsic, extinction in the UV band. However, polynomial fitting of
radio-to-UV SEDs reveals an increasing spectral bending going towards fainter
states, suggesting a UV excess likely due to the thermal emission from the
accretion disc.

observed [J. Wiersig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 253901 (2006)]. For the case of a
microdisk cavity with elliptical cross section we use the Husimi function to
analyse this localization in phase space. Moreover, we present a semiclassical
explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the Goos-Haenchen shift which works
very well even deep in the wave regime. This semiclassical correction to the
ray dynamics modifies the phase space structure such that modes can localize
either on stable islands or along unstable periodic ray trajectories.

evolves from a Bose distribution to a Fermi one as $\kappa$ varies from 0 to

an odd function of $\kappa$. The peak at positive momentum will shift to
negative momentum if $\kappa$ is negative.

dominated by total density fluctuations, in agreement with previous results of
other authors. We study also the restoration of the isospin symmetry in the

of the standard solar model (SSM), a homogeneous zero-age Sun. It would also
provide a cross-check on recent photospheric abundance determinations that have
altered the once excellent agreement between the SSM and helioseismology. As
further motivation, we discuss a speculative possibility in which photospheric
abundance/helioseismology puzzle is connected with the solar-system metal
differentiation that accompanied formation of the gaseous giant planets.
  The theoretical relationship between core C and N and the 13N and 15O solar

the Super-Kamiokande and SNO 8B neutrino capture rates, which calibrate the
temperature of the solar core. The primordial C and N abundances can then be
obtained from these neutrino fluxes and from a product of nuclear rates, with
little residual solar model dependence. We describe some of the recent
experimental advances that could allow this comparison to be made
(theoretically) at about the 9% level, and note that this uncertainty may be
reduced further due to ongoing work on the S-factor for 14N(p,gamma). The

Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). We show for the first time that an

four EUVI passbands (304, 171, 195, and 284 A). In the 304 A passband the
disturbance shows a velocity peak of 238+/-20 kms-1 within ~28 minutes of its
launch, varying in acceleration from 76 ms-2 to -102 ms-2. This passband
contains a strong contribution from a Si XI line (303.32 A) with a peak
formation temperature of ~1.6 MK. The 304 A emission may therefore be coronal
rather than chromospheric in origin. Comparable velocities and accelerations
are found in the coronal 195 A passband, while lower values are found in the
lower cadence 284 A passband. In the higher cadence 171 A passband the velocity
varies significantly, peaking at 475+/-47 kms-1 within ~20 minutes of launch,

cadence of the 171 A passband (2.5 minutes compared to 10 minutes for the
similar temperature response 195 A passband) is found to have a major effect on
the measured velocity and acceleration of the pulse, which increase by factors
of ~2 and ~10, respectively. This implies that previously measured values
(e.g., using EIT) may have been underestimated. We also note that the
disturbance shows strong reflection from a coronal hole in both the 171 and 195

extremum condition for the action requires additional constraints beyond the
solution of the field equations. In a higher dimensional world, such
constraints arise from variations of the metric which are local in the usual
four-dimensional spacetime, without changing the geometry of internal space. As
a consequence, continuous families of singular solutions of the field
equations, with arbitrary integration constants, are generically reduced to a
discrete subset of extrema of the action, similar to regular spaces. As an
example, no static extrema of the action with effective four-dimensional
gravity exist for six-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant. These
findings explain why the field equations of the reduced four-dimensional theory
are not consistent with arbitrary solutions of the higher dimensional field
equations - consistency requires the additional constraints. The characteristic
solutions for variable tension branes are non-static runaway solutions where
the effective four-dimensional cosmological constant vanishes as time goes to

there are three types of convergence rates and limit distributions. In
particular, a normal approximation with the standard rate does not always hold

problem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags
and characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three
measures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of
co-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank
algorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale
dataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a
semantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon
for the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of
WordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our
results clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of
relatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge
extraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.

that the older Class 2/3 objects are more centrally condensed than the younger

hierarchical configuration to a centrally condensed one. Only IC348 and the
Serpens core, the older clusters in the sample, shows signs of mass segregation

significant effect of dynamical interactions after a few Myr. The structure of
a cluster may also be linked to the turbulent energy in the natal cloud as the

features of entangled system in both pure as well as mixed states level. In the
pure state level, we are largely concerned about the existence and
characteristics of bipartite incomparable pair of states. We have found some
schemes for local transformation of one pure bipartite state to another,
incomparable in nature, by exploiting free unpreserved entanglement. Also, we
observed that different incomparable pair of states in $3\times 3$ may
co-operate with each other to cross the barrier of incomparability. Our next
goal was to probe critically the roots of the existence of incomparable states.
We have succeeded in connecting incomparability with some famous no-go theorems
of quantum mechanics. We have established it with no-flipping principle,
general anti-unitary operators and lastly with inner product preserving
operations. Thus we are able to pose incomparability as a good detector of some
non-physical operations. In the next part, we provide a new class of
multipartite bound entanglement in mixed state level. The class of states are
activable bound entangled. There are exactly four orthogonal activable bound
entangled states in any even number of qubit system. They have some interesting
features like Bell correlation, permutation symmetry, local Pauli connection,
non-compatibility, etc. Apart from those properties, the class of bound
entangled states have the remarkable feature of local indistinguishability in
quantum systems.

by radial oscillations in the 3:2 resonance. We show that the resonance may be

meridional circulation cells multiplies as $\Rey$ increases, and their shapes
become more complex, especially in the superfluid component, with multiple
secondary cells arising for $\Rey > 10^3$. The torque exerted by the normal

the mutual friction force dominates the vortex tension, and the streamlines of

its fundamental character it plays an important role in some theories in

that, surprisingly enough, the same idea that produces the bracket can be
slightly modified to produce algebraically stronger regular isotopy and ambient
isotopy invariants living in the quotient ring $R/I$, where the ring $R$ and
the ideal $I$ are: \begin{center} $R=\Z[\alpha,\beta,\delta]$, $I=< p_1, p_2

and update their strategies in every generation according to some microscopic
dynamical rule. In its spatial version, agents do not play with every other
but, instead, interact only with their neighbors, thus mimicking the existing
of a social or contact network that defines who interacts with whom. In this
work, we explore evolutionary, spatial PD systems consisting of two types of
agents, each with a certain update (reproduction, learning) rule. We
investigate two different scenarios: in the first case, update rules remain
fixed for the entire evolution of the system; in the second case, agents update
both strategy and update rule in every generation. We show that in a well-mixed
population the evolutionary outcome is always full defection. We subsequently
focus on two-strategy competition with nearest-neighbor interactions on the
contact network and synchronized update of strategies. Our results show that,
for an important range of the parameters of the game, the final state of the
system is largely different from that arising from the usual setup of a single,
fixed dynamical rule. Furthermore, the results are also very different if
update rules are fixed or evolve with the strategies. In these respect, we have
studied representative update rules, finding that some of them may become
extinct while others prevail. We describe the new and rich variety of final
outcomes that arise from this co-evolutionary dynamics. We include examples of
other neighborhoods and asynchronous updating that confirm the robustness of
our conclusions. Our results pave the way to an evolutionary rationale for
modelling social interactions through game theory with a preferred set of
update rules.

cm radio continuum maps of the new source using the 100 m Green Bank Telescope.
We conclude that the source is a new supernova remnant (SNR; G1.2--0.0) based
on: (1) the 0.9+/-0.2 keV thermal X-ray spectrum with emission lines from
highly ionized atoms; (2) the diffuse nature with an apparent extent of ~10 pc
at the Galactic center distance inferred from the X-ray absorption
(~8.5x10^{22} cm^{-2}); and (3) the nonthermal radio continuum spectral index
(~-0.5). Our discovery of an SNR in the Sgr D HII region leads to a revision of
the view of this system, which had been considered to be a thermal HII region
and its environment.

High Mass X-ray Binaries, whose number is rapidly growing thanks to the
observations of the Galactic plane performed with the INTEGRAL satellite. IGR
J16479-4514 has been regularly monitored with Swift/XRT since November 2007, to
study the quiescent emission, the outburst properties and their recurrence. A
new bright outburst, reaching fluxes above 10$^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$,
was caught by the Swift/BAT.
  Swift immediately re-pointed at the target with the narrow-field instruments
so that, for the first time, an outburst from a SFXT where a periodicity in the
outburst recurrence is unknown could be observed simultaneously in the 0.2--150
keV energy band. The X-ray emission is highly variable and spans almost four
orders of magnitude in count rate during the Swift/XRT observations covering a
few days before and after the bright peak. The X-ray spectrum in outburst is
hard and highly absorbed. The power-law fit resulted in a photon index of
0.98$\pm{0.07}$, and in an absorbing column density of $\sim5\times10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$. These observations demonstrate that in this source (similarly to
what was observed during the 2007 outburst from the periodic SFXT IGR
J11215-5952), the accretion phase lasts much longer than a few hours.

on the modelling of heteroscedasticity in time series is intuitively well
motivated in capturing many `stylized facts' concerning financial series, and
is now almost routinely used in a wide range of situations, often including
some where the data are not observed at equally spaced intervals of time.
However, such data is more appropriately analyzed with a continuous-time model
which preserves the essential features of the successful GARCH paradigm. One
possible such extension is the diffusion limit of Nelson, but this is
problematic in that the discrete-time GARCH model and its continuous-time
diffusion limit are not statistically equivalent. As an alternative,
Kl\""{u}ppelberg et al. recently introduced a continuous-time version of the
GARCH (the `COGARCH' process) which is constructed directly from a background
driving L\'{e}vy process. The present paper shows how to fit this model to
irregularly spaced time series data using discrete-time GARCH methodology, by
approximating the COGARCH with an embedded sequence of discrete-time GARCH
series which converges to the continuous-time model in a strong sense (in
probability, in the Skorokhod metric), as the discrete approximating grid grows
finer. This property is also especially useful in certain other applications,
such as options pricing. The way is then open to using, for the COGARCH,
similar statistical techniques to those already worked out for GARCH models and
to illustrate this, an empirical investigation using stock index data is
carried out.

V-band images of Pluto on 32 plates taken on 15 nights from 19 March 1933 to 10
March 1934. Most of these plates were taken with the Mount Wilson 60"" and 100""
telescopes, but 7 of the plates (now at the Harvard College Observatory) were
taken with the 12"" and 16"" Metcalf doublets at Oak Ridge. The plates were
measured with an iris diaphragm photometer, which has an average one-sigma
photometric error on these plates of 0.08 mag as measured by the repeatability
of constant comparison stars. The modern B and V magnitudes for the comparison
stars were measured with the Lowell Observatory Hall 1.1-m telescope. The
magnitudes in the plate's photographic system were converted to the Johnson B-
and V-system after correction with color terms, even though they are small in
size. We find that the average B-band mean opposition magnitude of Pluto in
1933-1934 was 15.73 +- 0.01, and we see a roughly sinusoidal modulation on the
rotational period (6.38 days) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.11 +- 0.03
mag. With this, we show that Pluto darkened by 5% from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955.
This darkening from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955 cannot be due to changing viewing
geometry (as both epochs had identical sub-Earth latitudes), so our
observations must record a real albedo change over the southern hemisphere. The
later darkening trend from 1954 to the 1980s has been explained by changing
viewing geometry (as more of the darker northern hemisphere comes into view).
Thus, we now have strong evidence for albedo changes on the surface of Pluto,
and these are most easily explained by the systematic sublimation of frosts
from the sunward pole that led to a drop in the mean surface albedo.
