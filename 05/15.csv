gravitational lens candidates observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope by the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey.
All targets were selected for higher-redshift emission lines and lower-redshift
continuum in a single Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum. The foreground
galaxies are primarily of early-type morphology, with redshifts from
approximately 0.05 to 0.5 and velocity dispersions from 160 km/s to 400 km/s;
the faint background emission-line galaxies have redshifts ranging from about
0.2 to 1.2. We confirm 70 systems showing clear evidence of multiple imaging of
the background galaxy by the foreground galaxy, as well as an additional 19
systems with probable multiple imaging. For 63 clear lensing systems, we
present singular isothermal ellipsoid and light-traces-mass gravitational lens
models fitted to the ACS imaging data. These strong-lensing mass measurements
are supplemented by magnitudes and effective radii measured from ACS
surface-brightness photometry and redshifts and velocity dispersions measured
from SDSS spectroscopy. These data constitute a unique resource for the
quantitative study of the inter-relations between mass, light, and kinematics
in massive early-type galaxies. We show that the SLACS lens sample is
statistically consistent with being drawn at random from a parent sample of
SDSS galaxies with comparable spectroscopic parameters and effective radii,
suggesting that the results of SLACS analyses can be generalized to the massive
early-type population.

with well-measured redshifts (ranging from z=0.06 to 0.36) and stellar velocity
dispersions (between 175 and 400 km/s) from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey
to derive numerous empirical scaling relations. The ratio between central
stellar velocity dispersion and isothermal lens-model velocity dispersion is
nearly unity within errors. The SLACS lenses define a fundamental plane (FP)
that is consistent with the FP of the general population of early-type
galaxies. We measure the relationship between strong-lensing mass M_lens within
one-half effective radius (R_e/2) and the dimensional mass variable M_dim =
G^-1 sigma_e2^2 R_e/2 to be log_10 [M_lens/10^11 M_Sun] = (1.03 +/- 0.04)
log_10 [M_dim/10^11 M_Sun] + (0.54 +/- 0.02) (where sigma_e2 is the projected
stellar velocity dispersion within R_e/2). The near-unity slope indicates that
the mass-dynamical structure of massive elliptical galaxies is independent of
mass, and that the ""tilt"" of the SLACS FP is due entirely to variation in total
(luminous plus dark) mass-to-light ratio with mass. Our results imply that
dynamical masses serve as a good proxies for true masses in massive elliptical
galaxies. Regarding the SLACS lenses as a homologous population, we find that
the average enclosed 2D mass profile goes as log_10 [M(<R)/M_dim] = (1.10 +/-
0.09) log_10 [R/R_e] + (0.85 +/- 0.03), consistent with an isothermal (flat
rotation curve) model when de-projected into 3D. This measurement is
inconsistent with the slope of the average projected aperture luminosity
profile at a confidence level greater than 99.9%, implying a minimum
dark-matter fraction of f_DM = 0.38 +/- 0.07 within one effective radius.

oscillation probabilities. The decoherence parameters as well as their energy
dependence are chosen in such a way that the damping affects only oscillations
with the large (atmospheric) $\Delta m^2$ and rapidly decreases with the
neutrino energy. This allows us to reconcile the positive LSND signal with
MiniBooNE and other null-result experiments. The standard explanations of
solar, atmospheric, KamLAND and MINOS data are not affected. No new particles,
and in particular, no sterile neutrinos are needed. The LSND signal is
controlled by the 1-3 mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and, depending on the degree
of damping, yields $0.0014 < \sin^2\theta_{13} < 0.034$ at $3\sigma$. The
scenario can be tested at upcoming $\theta_{13}$ searches: while the comparison
of near and far detector measurements at reactors should lead to a null-result
a positive signal for $\theta_{13}$ is expected in long-baseline accelerator
experiments. The proposed decoherence may partially explain the results of
Gallium detector calibrations and it can strongly affect supernova neutrino
signals.

with both one embedded dot and a double-dot side-coupled to leads is discussed

This is in good agreement with the recent direct measurement of DTD. The
observed featureless property of the DTD has been suggested to be favorable for
the double degenerate (DD) scenario but not for the SD scenario. If the mass
range of the companion star to the white dwarf (WD) were too narrow in the SD
model, its DTD would be too limited around the companion's main-sequence
lifetime to be consistent with the observed DTD. However, this is not the case
in our SD model that consists of the two channels of WD + RG (red giant) and WD
+ MS (main-sequence star). In these channels, the companion stars have a mass
range of \sim 0.9-3 M_\sun (WD+RG) and \sim 2- 6 M_\sun (WD+MS). The combined
mass range is wide enough to yield the featureless DTD. We emphasize that the
SD scenario should include two important processes: the optically thick winds
from the mass-accreting WD and the mass-stripping from the companion star by
the WD wind.

\log_{1/p} n$ with $1 \leq c \leq 2$, it holds: (1) if $p > 1/2$ then an
$r$-node clique is dominating in $G$ almost surely and, (2) if $p \leq (3 -
\sqrt{5})/2$ then an $r$-node clique is not dominating in $G$ almost surely.
The remaining range of probability $p$ is discussed with more attention. A
detailed study shows that this problem is answered by examination of
sub-logarithmic growth of $r$ upon $n$.

strongly dominated by turbulent photospheric convection. In the Modern period,
this domination was broken by a new more active dynamics of the inner layers of
the convection zone. Then, it is shown that the dramatic change of the sun

scenario of a chain of transitions in the solar convective zone is suggested in

suggested on the basis of this scenario. A relation between the recent
transitions and solar long-period chaotic dynamics has been found. Contribution
of the galactic turbulence (due to galactic cosmic rays) has been discussed.

stars, exploring the effects of varying the wind parameters and the density of
the initial ISM that permeates the volume of the cluster. These simulations
show that the ISM is compressed by the action of the winds into a structure of
dense knots and filaments. The structures that are produced resemble in a
qualitative way the observations of the IRAS 18511+0146 of Vig et al. (2007).

consequent breakdown of reduction. This evidence includes a large discrepancy
between the transition coupling of the ""bulk"" transition in lattice gauge

these measures, we find that the dominant limitation on astrometric performance
in this experiment is caused by tilt anisoplanatism. We then present an optimal

of reference stars in the face of this correlated random noise source. Our
methodology has the advantage of reducing the astrometric errors as the square
root of time and faster than the square root of the number of reference stars
-- effectively eliminating noise caused by atmospheric tilt to the point that
astrometric performance is limited by centering accuracy. Using 50 reference
stars we demonstrate single-epoch astrometric precision of ~ 1 mas in 1 second,
decreasing to < 100 microarcseconds in 2 minutes of integration time at the

envelope, triggering a convective thermonuclear runaway and a subsequent
classical, recurrent, or symbiotic nova. Prompted by uncertainties in the
composition at the base of the accreted envelope at the onset of convection, as
well as the range of abundances detected in nova ejecta, we examine the effects
of varying the composition of the accreted material. For high accretion rates
and carbon mass fractions < 0.002, we find that carbon, which is usually
assumed to trigger the runaway via proton captures, is instead depleted and
converted to 14N. Additionally, we quantify the importance of 3He, finding that
convection is triggered by 3He+3He reactions for 3He mass fractions > 0.002.
These different triggering mechanisms, which occur for critical abundances
relevant to many nova systems, alter the amount of mass that is accreted prior
to a nova, causing the nova rate to depend on accreted composition. Upcoming
deep optical surveys such as Pan-STARRS-1, Pan-STARRS-4, and the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope may allow us to detect the dependence of nova rates on
accreted composition. Furthermore, the burning and depletion of 3He with a mass
fraction of 0.001, which is lower than necessary for triggering convection,
still has an observable effect, resulting in a pre-outburst brightening in disk
quiescence to > Lsun and an increase in effective temperature to 6.5e4 K for a

model is investigated. A density inhomogeneity will cause an offset between the
center of figure and the center of mass and a re-orientation of the principal
axes away from those associated with the shape alone. Both of these effects can
alter the predicted YORP rate of change in angular velocity and obliquity. We
apply these corrections to the Itokawa shape model and find that its YORP
angular velocity rate is sensitive to offsets between its center of mass and
center of figure, with a shift on the order of 10 meters being able to change
the sign of the YORP effect for that asteroid. Given the non-detection of YORP
for Itokawa as of 2008, this can shed light on the density distribution within
that body. The theory supports a shift of the asteroid center of mass towards
Itokawa's neck region, where there is an accumulation of finer gravels.
Detection of the YORP effect for Itokawa should provide some strong constraints
on its density distribution. This theory could also be applied to asteroids
visited by future spacecraft to constrain density inhomogeneities.

galaxy Cygnus A as seen in the 5, 8 and 15-GHz radio bands using the highest
spatial resolution and signal-to-noise archival data available. We demonstrate
that the trace of the radio knots that delineate the jet and counterjet
deviates from a straight line and that the inner parts can be satisfactorily
fitted with the precession model of Hjellming & Johnston. The parameter values
of the precession model fits are all plausible although the jet speed is rather
low (< 0.5 c) but, on investigation, found to be consistent with a number of
other independent estimates of the jet speed in Cygnus A. We compare the masses
and precession periods for sources with known precession and find that for the
small number of AGN with precessing jets the precession periods are
significantly longer than those for microquasars.

of the nearer and further lobes, separated by many 10s of kpc and thus 10s of
thousands of years in light-travel time, yield additional temporal resolution

presence of X-ray emission from a counterjet i.e. a jet receding from Earth and
related to a previous episode of jet activity. The non-thermal X-ray emission,
we interpret as ICCMB radiation. There is an absence of any discernible X-ray
emission associated with a jet flowing towards Earth. We conclude that: (1) The
emission from a relic jet, indicates a previous episode of jet activity, that
took place earlier than the current jet activity appearing as synchrotron radio
emission. (2) The presence of X-ray emission from a relic counterjet of Cygnus
A and the absence of X-ray emission associated with any relic approaching jet
constrains the timescale between successive episodes of jet activity to ~10^6
years. (3) Transverse expansion of the jet causes expansion losses which shifts
the energy distribution to lower energies. (4) Assuming the electrons cooled
due to adiabatic expansion, the required magnetic field strength is
substantially smaller than the equipartition magnetic field strength. (5) A
high minimum Lorentz factor for the distribution of relativistic particles in
the current jet, of a few 10^3, is ejected from the central nucleus of this

formation in the universe, are redshifted in the frequency channels where the
present-day and future CMB experiments are sensitive. We estimate the
contribution to the CMB angular power spectrum by the emission in such lines in
merging star-forming galaxies. We used the Lacey-Cole approach to characterize
the distribution of the merging halos, together with a parametrization for the
star formation rate in each of them. Using observational data from a sample of
local, low-redshift, and high-redshift objects, we calibrated the luminosity in
each line as a function of the star formation rate. We show that the
correlation term arising from CO line emission is a significant source of
foreground for CMB in a broad range of frequencies (in particular in the 20-60
GHz band) and for 1000<l<8000, corresponding to angular scales smaller than 10
arcminutes. Moreover, we demonstrate that observing with different spectral
resolutions will give the possibility of increasing the amplitude of the signal
up to two orders of magnitude in C_l and will help separate the line
contribution from practically all other foreground sources and from the primary
fluctuations themselves, since these show no significant dependence on the

bandwidths as a new tool to construct a tomography of the universe, by probing
different redshift slices with varying thickness. (abridged)

beginning of an outburst was detected and in few months it became much brighter
and developed wide He and N lines, typical of a Wolf Rayet star of the
N-sequence. The maximum occurred in 1994 and afterwards the star slowly faded.
Analysis of its evolution showed that it has a variable mass-loss rate which
occasionally increases enormously, creating a false photosphere at a much
larger radius, making it appear a few magnitudes brighter. The present outburst

end points using the topological path redundancy of the network. In this paper,
\textit{Forward Error Correction} (FEC) is applied across multiple independent
paths to enhance the end-to-end reliability. Network paths are modeled as
erasure Gilbert-Elliot channels. It is known that over any erasure channel,
\textit{Maximum Distance Separable} (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability
of irrecoverable loss among all block codes of the same size. Based on the
adopted model for the error behavior, we prove that the probability of
irrecoverable loss for MDS codes decays exponentially for an asymptotically
large number of paths. Then, optimal rate allocation problem is solved for the
asymptotic case where the number of paths is large. Moreover, it is shown that
in such asymptotically optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a
positive rate \textit{iff} its quality is above a certain threshold. The
quality of a path is defined as the percentage of the time it spends in the bad
state. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm
with polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over a finite number of
paths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation
when the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation (found by
exhaustive search) very closely for practical number of paths, and provides
significant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate
allocation.

coordinates of C to the vertices of a graph, along with a specification of
linear state spaces and linear ``local constraint'' codes to be associated with
the edges and vertices, respectively, of the graph. The $\k$-complexity of a
graphical realization is defined to be the largest dimension of any of its
local constraint codes. $\k$-complexity is a reasonable measure of the
computational complexity of a sum-product decoding algorithm specified by a
graphical realization. The main focus of this paper is on the following
problem: given a linear code C and a graph G, how small can the $\k$-complexity
of a realization of C on G be? As useful tools for attacking this problem, we
introduce the Vertex-Cut Bound, and the notion of ``vc-treewidth'' for a graph,
which is closely related to the well-known graph-theoretic notion of treewidth.
Using these tools, we derive tight lower bounds on the $\k$-complexity of any
realization of C on G. Our bounds enable us to conclude that good
error-correcting codes can have low-complexity realizations only on graphs with
large vc-treewidth. Along the way, we also prove the interesting result that
the ratio of the $\k$-complexity of the best conventional trellis realization
of a length-n code C to the $\k$-complexity of the best cycle-free realization
of C grows at most logarithmically with codelength n. Such a logarithmic growth
rate is, in fact, achievable.

due to gas drag. We also derived the semi-analytical formula for the
planetesimal accretion rate as a function of ratios of the rates of the Hill
radius expansion, the damping, and planetesimal scattering by the planet. The
predicted low planetesimal accretion rate due to gap opening in early gas
accretion stages quantitatively shows that ""phase 2,"" which is a long slow gas
accretion phase before onset of runaway gas accretion, is not likely to occur.
In late stages, rapid Hill radius expansion fills the gap, resulting in
significant planetesimal accretion, which is as large as several $M_{\oplus}$

late pollution may reconcile the ubiquity of extrasolar giant planets with
metal-rich envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn inferred from interior structure

distinct structures are formed during dIrr formation based on observations and

between two gas-rich dIrr's with initially extended gas disks can have both
extended spheroids composed of older stellar populations and disks composed
mostly of gas and young stars. The simulated remnants with two distinct

natural tuning parameter that takes copper oxides from the antiferromagnet to
the superconducting region. In the metallic state above T_c the standard
Landau's Fermi-liquid theory of metals as typified by the temperature squared
(T^2) dependence of resistivity appears to break down. Whether the origin of
the non-Fermi-liquid behavior is related to physics specific to the cuprates is
a fundamental question still under debate. We uncover a new transformation from
the non-Fermi- to a standard Fermi-liquid state driven not by doping but by
magnetic field in the overdoped high-T_c superconductor Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+x}. From
the c-axis resistivity measured up to 45 T, we show that the Fermi-liquid
features appear above a sufficiently high field which decreases linearly with
temperature and lands at a quantum critical point near the superconductivity's
upper critical field -- with the Fermi-liquid coefficient of the T^2 dependence
showing a power-law diverging behavior on the approach to the critical point.
This field-induced quantum criticality bears a striking resemblance to that in
quasi-two dimensional heavy-Fermion superconductors, suggesting a common
underlying spin-related physics in these superconductors with strong electron
correlations.

filamentary structure (z=0.55), as part of our systematic study of the 12 most
distant clusters in the MACS sample. Of 1368 galaxies spectroscopically
observed in this field, 563 are identified as cluster members; of those, 203
are classified as emission-line galaxies, 260 as absorption-line galaxies, and
17 as E+A galaxies (defined by $\frac{H_{\delta}+H_{\gamma}}{2}>6$\AA and no
detection of [OII] and $H_{\beta}$ in emission). The variation of the fraction
of emission- and absorption-line galaxies as a function of local projected
galaxy density confirms the well-known morphology-density relation, and becomes
flat at projected galaxy densities less than $\sim 20Mpc^{-2}. Interestingly,
16 out of 17 E+A galaxies lie (in projection) within the ram-pressure stripping
radius around the cluster core, which we take to be direct evidence of
ram-pressure stripping being the primary mechanism that terminates
star-formation in the E+A population of galaxy clusters. This conclusion is
supported by the rarity of E+A galaxies in the filament which rules out galaxy
mergers as the dominant driver of evolution for E+A galaxies in clusters. In
addition, we find the 42 e(a) and 27 e(b) member galaxies, i.e., the
dusty-starburst and starburst galaxies respectively, to be spread out across
almost the entire study area. Their spatial distribution, which shows a strong
preference for the filament region, suggests that starbursts are triggered in

when the alternative is that the incidence functions are linearly ordered, but
not equal. The motivation stems from the fact that in many examples such a
linear ordering seems reasonable intuitively and is borne out generally from
empirical observations. These tests are more powerful when the ordering is

Transformations of uniform motion are determined by the Doppler shift, while
its square root transforms to a uniformly accelerated frame. A time-velocity
space metric is derived, by magnifying the Beltrami coordinates with the
geometric time, which is similar to the one obtained by Friedmann using
Einstein's equations in which the mass tensor describes a universe of dust at
zero pressure. No such assumption nor any approximation in which the
coordinates increase with time (i.e., constant velocities) need be made. The
hyperbolic velocities are related to the sides of a Lambert quadrilateral. In

restriction on rows and columns of a matrix. For any order restrictions on rows
and columns of a matrix, sufficient conditions are derived for the algorithm to
converge in a single application of row and column operations. The new
algorithm is applicable to a broad collection of order restrictions. In
practice, it is easy to design a study such that the sufficient conditions
derived in this paper are satisfied. For instance, the sufficient conditions
are satisfied in a balanced design. Using the estimation procedure developed in
this article, a bootstrap test for order restrictions on rows and columns of a

compare the proposed test with some existing test procedures in terms of size
and power. The new methodology is illustrated by applying it to a set of

quasi-analytical description of the spinodal decomposition scenario. By
exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relations the covariance matrix of
density fluctuations is derived as a function of the wave vector for nuclear
matter at given values of density, charge asymmetry, temperature, and of the
time that the system spends in the instability region. Then density
fluctuations in ordinary space are implemented with a Fourier transform
performed in a finite cubic lattice. Inside this box, domains with different
density coexist, from which clusters of nucleons eventually emerge. Within our
approach, the isotopic distributions are determined by the N/Z ratio of the
leading unstable isoscalarlike mode and by isovectorlike fluctuations present
in the matter undergoing the spinodal decomposition. Hence the average value of
the N/Z ratio of clusters and the width of the relative distribution reflect
the properties of the symmetry energy. Generating a large number of events,
these calculations allow a careful investigation of the cluster isotopic
content as a function of the cluster density. A uniform decrease of the average
charge asymmetry and of the width of the isotopic distributions with increasing
density is observed. Finally we remark that the results essentially refer to
the early break--up of the system.

exponential families suitable for modeling count data. A zero-inflated power
series distribution is a mixture of a power series distribution and a
degenerate distribution at zero, with a mixing probability $p$ for the
degenerate distribution. This distribution is useful for modeling count data
that may have extra zeros. One question is whether the mixture model can be
reduced to the power series portion, corresponding to $p=0$, or whether there
are so many zeros in the data that zero inflation relative to the pure power
series distribution must be included in the model i.e., $p\geq0$. The problem
is difficult partially because $p=0$ is a boundary point. Here, we present a
Bayesian test for this problem based on recognizing that the parameter space
can be expanded to allow $p$ to be negative. Negative values of $p$ are
inconsistent with the interpretation of $p$ as a mixing probability, however,
they index distributions that are physically and probabilistically meaningful.
We compare our Bayesian solution to two standard frequentist testing procedures
and find that using a posterior probability as a test statistic has slightly
higher power on the most important ranges of the sample size $n$ and parameter
values than the score test and likelihood ratio test in simulations. Our method
also performs well on three real data sets.

mass, the radial position of the break has increased with cosmic time by a
factor 1.3+/-0.1 between z~1 and z~0. This is in agreement with a moderate
inside-out growth of the disk galaxies in the last ~8 Gyr. In the same period
of time, the surface brightness level in the rest-frame B-band at which the
break takes place has increased by 3.3+/-0.2 mag/arcsec^2 (a decrease in
brightness by a factor of 20.9+/-4.2). We have explored the distribution of the
scale lengths of the disks in the region inside the break, and how this
parameter relates to the break radius. We also present results of the
statistical analysis of profiles of artificial galaxies, to assess the
reliability of our results.

invariance is broken by the logarithmic running of double-trace operators -- a

as the bulk dual of double-trace running. In this paper we make this
correspondence more precise. By standard field theory methods, we show that the
double-trace beta function is quadratic in the coupling, to all orders in
planar perturbation theory. Tuning the double-trace coupling to its (complex)
fixed point, we find conformal dimensions of the form 2 + i b, as formally
expected for operators dual to bulk scalars that violate the stability bound.
We also show that conformal invariance is broken in perturbation theory if and

general large N field theory with vanishing single-trace beta functions.

statistical research, ostensibly in relation to applications in genomics and

provide very important notions of errors in this context comparable to the role
of error probabilities in classical testing problems. Accurate estimation of
positive FDR (pFDR), a variant of the FDR, is essential in assessing and
controlling this measure. In a recent paper, the authors proposed a model-based
nonparametric Bayesian method of estimation of the pFDR function. In
particular, the density of p-values was modeled as a mixture of decreasing beta
densities and an appropriate Dirichlet process was considered as a prior on the
mixing measure. The resulting procedure was shown to work well in simulations.
In this paper, we provide some theoretical results in support of the beta
mixture model for the density of p-values, and show that, under appropriate
conditions, the resulting posterior is consistent as the number of hypotheses
grows to infinity.

approximately preserved in the final ratio of BH to bulge mass. Because this

BH-to-bulge mass ratio results. We also obtain a relation between BH mass and

statistics were used. Clusters show two distinct regimes of clustering: 1) on
scales of superclusters (~40/h Mpc) the CCF is represented by a power law; 2)
on larger scales a gradual transition to homogeneity (~100/h Mpc) is observed.
We also present the correlation analysis of the galaxy distribution taken from
DR6 SDSS main galaxy database. In case of galaxies the limiting scales of the
different clustering regimes are 1)10-15/h Mpc; 2) 40-50/h Mpc. The differences
in the characteristic scales and scaling exponents of the cluster and galaxy
distribution can be naturally explained within the theory of biased structure
formation. We compared the density contrasts of inhomogeneities in the cluster
and galaxy distributions in the SDSS region. The estimation of the relative
cluster-galaxy bias gives the value b = 5 +/- 2. The distribution of real
clusters is compared to that of simulated (model) clusters (the MareNostrum
Universe simulations). We selected a cluster sample from 500/h Mpc simulation
box with WMAP3 cosmological parameters and sigma_8 = 0.8. We found a general
agreement between the distribution of observed and simulated clusters. The
differences are mainly due to the presences of the Shapley supercluster in the
observed sample. On the basis of SDSS galaxy sample we study properties of the
power law behavior showed by the CCF on small scales. We show that this
phenomenon is quite complex, with significant scatter in scaling properties,

systems, graphity models can be studied analytically by estimating their
partition functions or numerically by Monte Carlo simulations. Results

possibly, very weak emission from HCO+ and CN; HCN, H2CO, and SiO are not

of HCO+ and CN (relative to 13CO) stands in sharp contrast to the strong HCO+
and CN emission that characterizes most low-mass, pre-main sequence stars that
have been the subjects of molecular emission-line surveys, and is suggestive of
a very low level of X-ray-induced molecular ionization within the BP Psc disk.

close companion.

diversity entropy of complex systems can provide valuable information about the
respective possible unfolding of dynamics. In the case of self-avoiding random
walks, the situation assumed here, the diversity measurement allows one to
quantify in how many different places an agent may effectively arrive after a
given number of steps from its initial activity. Because this measurement is
highly affected by border effects frequently found as a consequence of network
sampling, it becomes critical to devise means for sound estimation of the
diversity without being affected by this type of artifacts. We describe such an

the self-avoiding random walk dynamics in two real-world networks, namely bone

there has been relatively little attention to the use of graph theoretic

similar at >0.15 r_500 and are consistent with a ""universal temperature

kpc - r_500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from Vikhlinin et
al. (2008). Despite large scatter in the entropy values at <0.15 r_500, the
intrinsic scatter from r_2500 is much smaller and remains the same (~10%) to
r_500. We also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. It appears that
the average gas fraction between r_2500 and r_500 has no temperature
dependence, ~ 0.12 for 1 - 10 keV systems. The group gas fractions within
r_2500 are generally low and have large scatter. This work shows that the
difference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty of
compressing group gas to inside r_2500. The large scatter of the group gas
fraction within r_2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around the
center and may be responsible for the large scatter of the luminosities.
Nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyond
r_2500, from the results on gas fraction and entropy. Therefore, mass proxies
can be extended into low mass systems. The M-T and M-Y relations derived in
this work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2E13 h^-1 M_solar.

show that the structure of the amplitudes corresponds to a generalization of
the structure noted earlier in a calculation without a chemical potential (the
associated integrals carry the dependence on the chemical potential). Our
calculation shows that the chiral anomaly is unaffected by the presence of a
chemical potential at finite temperature. However, unlike the earlier
calculation (in the absence of a chemical potential) odd point functions do not
vanish. We trace this to the fact that in the presence of a chemical potential
the generalized charge conjugation symmetry of the theory allows for such
amplitudes. In fact, we find that all the even point functions are even
functions of the chemical potential while the odd point functions are odd
functions of it which is consistent with this generalized charge conjugation
symmetry. We show that the origin of the structure of the amplitudes is best
seen from a formulation of the theory in terms of left and right handed

transport is deduced. Rotating stellar models with different mass are computed
under the effect of the coefficient. Then rotation profiles are obtained from
the theoretical stellar models. The total angular momentum of solar model with
only hydrodynamic instabilities is about 13 times larger than that of the Sun
at the age of the Sun, and this model can not reproduce quasi-solid rotation in
the radiative region. However, not only can the solar model with magnetic
fields reproduce an almost uniform rotation in the radiative region, but its
total angular momentum is consistent with helioseismic result at the level of 3
$\sigma$ at the age of the Sun. The rotation of solar-like stars with magnetic
fields is almost uniform in the radiative region. But there is an obvious
transition region of angular velocity between the convective core and the
radiative region of models with 1.2 - 1.5 $M_{\odot}$, where angular velocity
has a sharp radial change, which is different from the rotation profile of the
Sun and massive stars with magnetic fields. Moreover the changes of the angular
velocity in the transition region increase with the increasing in the age and

a procedure to quantify errors in estimates of N-point correlation functions.
We do this by means of a small simulation study with simple point process
models and estimating the two-point correlation functions and their errors. The
coverage of confidence intervals obtained using bootstrap is compared with
those obtained from assuming Poisson errors. The bootstrap procedure considered
here is adapted for use with spatial (i.e. dependent) data. In particular, we
describe a marked point bootstrap where, instead of resampling points or blocks
of points, we resample marks assigned to the data points. These marks are
numerical values that are based on the statistic of interest. We describe how
the marks are defined for the two- and three-point correlation functions. By
resampling marks, the bootstrap samples retain more of the dependence structure
present in the data. Furthermore, this method of bootstrap can be performed
much quicker than some other bootstrap methods for spatial data, making it a
more practical method with large datasets. We find that with clustered point
datasets, confidence intervals obtained using the marked point bootstrap has
empirical coverage closer to the nominal level than the confidence intervals
obtained using Poisson errors. The bootstrap errors were also found to be
closer to the true errors for the clustered point datasets.

dwarfs, we analyze and show that the observed bimodality of $t_E$ can be
derived from the accepted density distributions of both populations. Our
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) one sample test shows that that a white dwarf
population of about $25% $ of all stars in the galaxy agrees well with the
observed bimodality with a KS significance level greater than 97%.

episode we can reproduce a lobe structure having a `front-lobe', i.e., a small
bulge on the front of the main lobe, such as that in the PN Mz~3. (2) In some
runs dense clumps are formed along the symmetry axis, such as those observed in
the pre-PN M1-92. (3) The mass loss history of the slow wind has a profound
influence on the PN structure. (4) A dense expanding torus (ring; disk) is
formed in most of our runs. The torus is formed from the inflated lobes, and
not from a separate equatorial mass loss episode. (5) The torus and lobes are
formed at the same time and from the same mass loss rate episode. However, when
the slow wind density is steep enough, the ratio of the distance divided by the
radial velocity is larger for regions closer to the equatorial plane than for
regions closer to the symmetry axis. (6) With the short jet-active phase a
linear relation between distance and expansion velocity is obtained in many
cases. (7) Regions at the front of the lobe are moving sufficiently fast to

study the ground state of a homogenous system of bosons in continuous space,
from the interaction retaining only the Fourier modes $v(\k)$ belonging to a

that for $v(\k)>0$ the ground state is asymptotically fully Bose-condensed,

that when the diffusion vector fields do not commute, this is not true for
strong order one methods. Here we prove that when there is no drift, and the

by the sinh-log series. In other words, the mean-square error associated with a
numerical method based on the sinh-log series, is always smaller than the

utilizes the underlying Hopf algebra structure of these series, and a

regions of the NUHM1 parameter space that are excluded because the LSP is a
selectron. We also find new regions where the neutralino relic density falls
within the range preferred by astrophysical and cosmological measurements,
thanks to rapid annihilation through direct-channel Higgs poles, or
coannihilation with selectrons, or because the LSP composition crosses over
from being mainly bino to mainly Higgsino. Generalizing further to the NUHM2,
we find regions of its parameter space where a sneutrino is the LSP, and others
where neutralino coannihilation with sneutrinos is important for the relic
density. In both the NUHM1 and the NUHM2, there are slivers of parameter space
