superconducting pairing mechanism in the new iron-based materials. We develop a
general SU(4) theoretical framework for studying a two-orbital model and
discuss a number of scenarios that may be operational within this orbital
fluctuation paradigm. The orbital and spin symmetry of the superconducting
order parameter is argued to be highly non-universal and dependent on the
details of the underlying band structure. We introduce a minimal two-orbital
model for the Fe-pnictides characterized by non-degenerate orbitals that
strongly mix with each other. They correspond to the iron ""d_xy"" orbital and to
an effective combination of ""d_zx"" and ""d_zy"", respectively. Using this
effective model we perform RPA calculations of susceptibilities and effective
pairing interactions. We find that spin and orbital fluctuations are,
generally, strongly coupled and we identify the parameters that control this
coupling as well as the relative strength of various channels.

cooling stellar envelope (for \Delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the blue

shared classical randomness are studied. The following facts are established:
  (i) There is a ball of local operations with shared randomness lying within
the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely
noisy channel.
  (ii) The existence of the ball of local operations with shared randomness is
employed to prove that the weak membership problem for local operations with
shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard.
  (iii) Local operations with shared entanglement are characterized in terms of
linear functionals that are ``completely'' positive on a certain cone K of
separable Hermitian operators, under a natural notion of complete positivity
appropriate to that cone. Local operations with shared randomness (but not
entanglement) are also characterized in terms of linear functionals that are
merely positive on that same cone K.
  (iv) Existing characterizations of no-signaling operations are generalized to
the multi-party setting and recast in terms of the Choi-Jamiolkowski
representation for quantum super-operators. It is noted that the standard
nonlocal box is an example of a no-signaling operation that is separable, yet
cannot be implemented by local operations with shared entanglement.

generated when a rectangular layer of fluid is locally heated beneath its free
surface is presented. We focus on the instability of a stationary cellular
pattern of wave number $k_s$ which undergoes a globally subcritical transition
to traveling waves by parity-breaking symmetry. The experimental results show
how the emerging traveling mode ($2/3k_{s}$) switches on a resonant triad
($k_s$, $k_s/2$, $2k_{s}/3$) within the cellular pattern yielding a ``mixed''
pattern. The nature of this transition is described quantitatively in terms of
the evolution of the fundamental modes by complex demodulation techniques. The
B\' enard-Marangoni convection accounts for the different dynamics depending on
the depth of the fluid layer and on the vertical temperature difference. The
existence of a hysteresis cycle has been evaluated quantitatively. When the
bifurcation to traveling waves is measured in the vicinity of the codimension-2
bifurcation point, we measure a decrease of the subcritical interval in which
the traveling mode becomes unstable. From the traveling wave state the system
under goes a {\it new} global secondary bifurcation to an alternating pattern
which doubles the wavelength ($k_{s}/2$) of the primary cellular pattern, this
result compares well with theoretical predictions [P. Coullet and G. Ioss, {\em
Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 64}, 8 66 (1990)]. In this cascade of bifurcations
towards a defect dynamics, bistability due to the subcritical behavior of our
system is the reason for the coexistence of two different modulated patterns
connected by a front. These fronts are stationary for a finite interval of the
control parameters.

the vibrational band origins have been calculated, as well as the structural
properties of the associated wavefunctions. The study is extended to cold
Rg-H$_2$ scattering. The molecular systems are studied variationally using a
very simple, yet effective, trial wavefunction. A large number of Potential
Energy Surfaces available from the literature is considered. A comparative
analysis shows that differences of up to two orders of magnitude exist for the
zero energy elastic cross sections of the five complexes. Corrections to the

analyzed based on a model proposed by Haldane. We study the effect of finite
temperature on this phase transition. We have found that finite temperature
would drive this TQPT to be a crossover, while it is stable against the weak
short range interaction. When the interaction is strong enough, however, this
TQPT is unstable and other states would emerge. Then we investigate the effect
of the on-site energy in the original haldane model. The critical difference
between our TQPT and the topological phase transition in conventional quantum
Hall system is discussed. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our
analysis to a topological phase transition proposed in a realistic system.

associated with its intracluster medium. Surprisingly, these observations imply
that the dust must be very short-lived compared to the time since the last
Galactic plane crossing of the cluster.Here we propose a simple mechanism to
explain this short lifetime. We argue that the kinetic energy of the material
ejected during a stellar collision may be sufficient to remove the gas and dust
entirely from a cluster, or to remove the gas as a wind, in addition to
partially destroying the dust. By calculating the rate of stellar collisions
using an N-body model for the cluster, we find remarkable agreement between the
average time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime in this cluster,
suggesting a possible close relation between the two phenomena. Furthermore, we
also obtain the birthrate of blue stragglers formed through collisions in M15.
By comparing with the observed number of blue stragglers, we derive an upper
limit for their average lifetime which turns out to be consistent with recent
model calculations, thereby lending further support to our model.

relatively good compatibility with the bounds from Higgs searches at LEP is

SUSY mass scales, allowing to compare the reach of the LHC and the ILC in the

somewhat higher mass scales that results in a similar Higgs and SUSY spectrum

the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of
science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will
have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is
driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking
an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and
mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at
Cerro Pach\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m
effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel
camera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second
exposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given
night. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000
square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\sigma$
point-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\sim 24.5$ (AB). The
project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations
by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with
$\delta<+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,
covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\% of the observing time
will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a
18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the
anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. The
remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a
Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,
including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion
objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.

modifications are argued to be present in loop quantum gravity and in any
theory which represents spacetime in a fundamentally piecewise-linear fashion.
The appearance of unusual statistics may be a generic feature (such as the
deformed position-momentum uncertainty relations and the appearance of a
fundamental length scale) which are to be expected in any theory of quantum
gravity, and which could be testable.

significant effect on the evolution of supernovae. There is insufficient
knowledge of these strengths and very little data for important radioactive
nuclei. Purpose: Determine whether it is feasible to obtain EC strength from
studies of T_o+1 excitations in (p,n) reactions, and whether this might yield
information for radioactive nuclei. Methods: Cross sections for the
{58,60,62,64}Ni(p,n){58,60,62,64}Cu reactions were measured over the angular
range of 0.3 deg to 11.6 deg at 134.3 MeV using the IUCF neutron time-of-flight
facility. esults: The T_o+1 excitations in {60,62}Ni were identified by
comparison with inelastic proton scattering spectra, their B(GT) were
extracted, and the corresponding electron capture rates in supernovae were
calculated. Data from the TRIUMF (n,p) experiments at 198 MeV were reanalyzed;
the electron capture rates for the reanalyzed data are in moderately good
agreement with the higher resolution (p,n) results, but differ in detail. The
possibility of future measurements with radioactive nuclei was considered.
Conclusions: It is possible to determine electron capturestrength from (p,n)
experiments. This approach may make it possible to obtain electron capture
strength for radioactive nuclei by studying (p,n) reactions in inverse
kinematics.

gulf stream that circulates warm saline water from southern latitudes to
Europe. In North Atlantic ocean the stream gives out a large amount of heat,
cools down and sinks to the bottom to complete the Thermohaline circulation.
There is considerable debate on the stability of the stream to inputs of fresh
water from the melting ice in Greenland and Arctic. The circulation, being
switched off, will have massive impact on the climate of Europe.
Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) has warned of this danger in
its recent report. Our aim is to model the Thermohaline circulation at the
point where it sinks in the North-Atlantic. We create a two dimensional
discrete map modeling the salinity gradient and vertical velocity of the
stream. We look for how a perturbation in the form of fresh water release can
destabilise the circulation by pushing the velocity below a certain threshold.

a three-component source for which each component is quadruply imaged. The lens
is a massive galaxy member of the cluster Cl J0152.7-1357 at z ~ 0.84. Taking
advantage of this exceptional configuration and of the excellent angular
resolution of the HST/ACS, we measure the properties of the lens. Several
parametric macroscopic models were developed for the lens galaxy, starting from
pointlike to extended image models. For a lens model in terms of a singular
isothermal sphere with external shear, the Einstein radius is found to be R_{E}
= (9.54 +/- 0.15) kpc. The external shear points to the cluster's northern mass
peak. The unknown redshift of the source is determined to be higher than 1.9
and lower than 2.9. Our estimate of the lensing projected total mass inside the
Einstein radius, M_{len}(R < 9.54 kpc), depends on the source distance and lies
between 4.6 and 6.2 x 10^{11} M_{Sun}. This result turns out to be compatible
with the dynamical estimate based on an isothermal model. By considering the
constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio that comes from the evolution of
the Fundamental Plane, we can exclude the possibility that at more than 4 sigma
level the total mass enclosed inside the Einstein ring is only luminous matter.
Moreover, the photometric-stellar mass measurement within the Einstein radius
gives a minimum value of 50% (1 sigma) for the dark-to-total matter fraction.
The lensing analysis has allowed us to investigate the distribution of mass of
the deflector, also providing some interesting indications on scales that are
larger and smaller than the Einstein radius of the lens galaxy. The combination
of different diagnostics has proved to be essential in determining quantities
that otherwise would have not been directly measurable with the current data.

Kamioka mine, as is LCGT. The progress of CLIO between 2005 and 2007 (room- and
cryogenic-temperature experiments) is introduced in this article. In a
room-temperature experiment, we made efforts to improve the sensitivity. The
current best sensitivity at 300 K is about $6 \times 10^{-21} /\sqrt{\rm Hz}$
around 400 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the strain (not displacement) sensitivity is
comparable to that of LIGO, although the baselines of CLIO are 40-times shorter
(CLIO: 100m, LIGO: 4km). This is because seismic noise is extremely small in
Kamioka mine. We operated the interferometer at room temperature for
gravitational wave observations. We obtained 86 hours of data. In the cryogenic
experiment, it was confirmed that the mirrors were sufficiently cooled (14 K).
However, we found that the radiation shield ducts transferred 300K radiation
into the cryostat more effectively than we had expected. We observed that noise
caused by pure aluminum wires to suspend a mirror was suppressed by cooling the
mirror.

strength of the instabilities of LCGT depends on the mirror curvature more
weakly than that of Advanced LIGO, the requirement of the mirror curvature
accuracy is easier to be achieved. The difference in the parametric
instabilities between LCGT and Advanced LIGO is because of the thermal noise
reduction methods (LCGT, cooling sapphire mirrors; Advanced LIGO, fused silica
mirrors with larger laser beams), which are the main strategies of the
projects. Elastic Q reduction by the barrel surface (0.2 mm thickness
Ta$_2$O$_5$) coating is effective to suppress instabilities in the LCGT arm
cavity. Therefore, the cryogenic interferometer is a smart solution for the
parametric instabilities in addition to thermal noise and thermal lensing.

mass limit, and there is no reason why Pad\'e transformations should help in
estimating parameters better in data analysis. Moreover, adding a pole to the
flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these Pad\'e-approximated flux
formulas. Pad\'e approximants may be useful in suggesting the form of fitting
formulas. We compare a 15-orbit numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group

to be detected from any GRB, with R ~ 12 mag in KAIT observations starting 42 s
after the GRB trigger, including filtered detections during prompt emission.
However, our high S/N ratio afterglow spectrum displays only extremely weak
absorption lines at what we argue is the host redshift of z = 1.60435 - in
contrast to the three other, much stronger Mg II absorption systems observed at
lower redshifts. Together with Keck adaptive optics observations which fail to
reveal a host galaxy coincident with the burst position, our observations
suggest a halo progenitor and offer a cautionary tale about the use of Mg II
for GRB redshift determination. We present early through late-time observations
spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, constrain the connection between the
prompt emission and early variations in the light curve (we observe no
correlation), and discuss possible origins for an unusual, marked rebrightening
that occurs a few hours after the burst: likely either a late-time refreshed
shock or a wide-angle secondary jet. Analysis of the late-time afterglow is
most consistent with a wind environment, suggesting a massive star progenitor.
Together with GRB 070125, this may indicate that a small but significant
portion of star formation in the early universe occurred far outside what we
consider a normal galactic disk.

during the last two decades. It consists in the presence of a minimum in the
mean time spent by a Brownian particle to exit from a potential well in the
presence of a fluctuating external force, as a function of the mean frequency
(or the correlation time) of the latter. This work studies the role played by
the asymmetry of a piecewise linear potential in the RA effect, and, in
general, the behavior of the mean first passage time and the mean velocity of
the particle crossing through the potential barrier. A strong dependence on the
asymmetry of the potential has been found which can be put in relationship with
the current in the ratchet whose the potential here used is an elementary
module. In this case a current reversal as a function of the frequency of the
switching potential occurs. Comparison of the calculations with the
Doering-Gadua model have been performed, as well as comparison with smooth
symmetrical potentials, by checking for the robustness of the resonant
correlation time. The calculations have been done by solving numerically the
Langevin equation in the presence of an uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The
resonant mean first passage times show an unexpected behavior as a function of
the thermal noise intensity. The related curves present for the different
symmetries an unexpected inversion of their relative behavior beyond a certain
threshold value of the noise. This means that the current reversal can only
occur for weak noise intensities, lower than that threshold value.

generating function for the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions, which
specializes to a new and surprising $q$-analog of a classical formula for the
exponential generating function of the Eulerian polynomials. This $q$-analog
computes the joint distribution of excedance number and major index, the only
of the four important Euler-Mahonian distributions that had not yet been

Eulerian polynomials. Our Eulerian quasisymmetric functions refine symmetric
functions that have occurred in various representation theoretic and

certain distribution of delay times. The local dynamics is chaotic in the
absence of coupling and thus the network is a paradigm of a complex system.
There are two regimes of synchronization, depending on the distribution of
delays: when the delays are sufficiently heterogeneous the network synchronizes
on a steady-state (that is unstable for the uncoupled maps); when the delays
are homogeneous, it synchronizes in a time-dependent state (that is either
periodic or chaotic). Using two global indicators we quantify the
synchronizability on the two regimes, focusing on the roles of the network
connectivity and the topology. The connectivity is measured in terms of the
average number of links per node, and we consider various topologies
(scale-free, small-world, star, and nearest-neighbor with and without a central
hub). With weak connectivity and weak coupling strength, the network displays
an irregular oscillatory dynamics that is largely independent of the topology
and of the delay distribution. With heterogeneous delays, we find a threshold
connectivity level below which the network does not synchronize, regardless of
the network size. This minimum average number of neighbors seems to be
independent of the delay distribution. We also analyze the effect of
self-feedback loops and find that they have an impact on the synchronizability
of small networks with large coupling strengths. The influence of feedback,
enhancing or degrading synchronization, depends on the topology and on the
distribution of delays.

extension to congestion games where players might act in a malicious way. In
such a game each player has two types. Either the player is a rational player
seeking to minimize her own delay, or - with a certain probability - the player
is malicious in which case her only goal is to disturb the other players as
much as possible.
  We show that such games do in general not possess a Bayesian Nash equilibrium
in pure strategies (i.e. a pure Bayesian Nash equilibrium). Moreover, given a
game, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether it admits a pure
Bayesian Nash equilibrium. This result even holds when resource latency
functions are linear, each player is malicious with the same probability, and
all strategy sets consist of singleton sets. For a slightly more restricted
class of malicious Bayesian congestion games, we provide easy checkable
properties that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a pure
Bayesian Nash equilibrium.
  In the second part of the paper we study the impact of the malicious types on
the overall performance of the system (i.e. the social cost). To measure this
impact, we use the Price of Malice. We provide (tight) bounds on the Price of
Malice for an interesting class of malicious Bayesian congestion games.
Moreover, we show that for certain congestion games the advent of malicious
types can also be beneficial to the system in the sense that the social cost of
the worst case equilibrium decreases. We provide a tight bound on the maximum
factor by which this happens.

previously toward GV Tau S (Gibb et al. 2007) was not present during the epoch
of our observations. Instead, we detect warm (~500 K) molecular absorption with
similar properties toward the northern infrared companion, GV Tau N. At the
epoch of our observations, the absorbing gas toward GV Tau N was approximately
at the radial velocity of the GV Tau molecular envelope, but it was redshifted
with respect to the star by ~13 km/s. One interpretation of our results is that
GV Tau N is also a binary and that most of the warm molecular absorption arises
in a circumbinary disk viewed close to edge-on.

considerably weak lines measured on the very high-S/N spectrum, while the
non-LTE correction and the gravity-darkening correction were adequately taken
into account. It was confirmed that these alkali elements are mildly
underabundant ([Li/H] ~ -0.6, [Na/H] ~ -0.3, and [K/H] ~ -0.2) compared to the
solar system values, as generally seen also in other metals. Since the tendency
of Li being more deficient than Na and K is qualitatively similar to what is
seen in typical interstellar cloud, the process of interstellar gas accretion
may be related with the abundance anomaly of Vega, as suspected in the case of
lambda Boo stars.

the readout time for ion qubits. PFLs also provide good coherent ion-photon
coupling by matching a large fraction of an ion's emission pattern to a single
optical propagation mode (TEM00). To this end we have optically characterized a
large numerical aperture phase Fresnel lens (NA=0.64) designed for use at 369.5
nm, the principal fluorescence detection transition for Yb+ ions. A
diffraction-limited spot w0=350+/-15 nm (1/e^2 waist) with mode quality M^2=
1.08+/-0.05 was measured with this PFL. From this we estimate the minimum
expected free space coherent ion-photon coupling to be 0.64%, which is twice
the best previous experimental measurement using a conventional multi-element
lens. We also evaluate two techniques for improving the entanglement fidelity

galaxy clusters. The cavities are formed only with relativistic cosmic rays
that eventually diffuse into the surrounding gas. We explore the evolution of
cavities formed with a wide range of cosmic ray diffusion rates. In previous
numerical simulations cavities are formed by injecting ultra-hot but
non-relativistic gas which increases the global thermal energy, offsetting
radiative losses in the gas and helping to solve the cooling flow problem.
Contrary to these results, we find that X-ray cavities formed solely by cosmic
rays have a global cooling effect. As the cluster gas is displaced by cosmic
rays, a global expansion of the cluster gas occurs with associated cooling that
exceeds the heating by shock waves as the cavity forms. Most cosmic rays in our
cavity evolutions do not move beyond the cooling radius even after 1 Gyr. The
gas density is depressed by cosmic rays, becomes buoyant, and undergoes a
significant outward mass transfer within the cooling radius, carrying cosmic
rays and relatively low entropy gas to distant regions in the cluster where it
remains for times exceeding the local cooling time in the hot gas. This
post-cavity mass outflow due to cosmic ray buoyancy may contribute toward
solving the cooling flow problem. We describe the energetics, size, stability
and buoyant rise of X-ray cavities in detail, showing how each depends on the
rate of cosmic ray diffusion.

the mass distribution of clusters themselves is in excellent agreement with our
model, and is consistent with a single spectrum {\it by number of stars} of the
type $n^\beta$ with beta between -1.8 and -2.2 down to the smallest clusters
without any preferred mass scale for cluster formation. We also use the random
sampling model to estimate the statistics of the maximal mass star in clusters,
and confirm the discrepancy with observations found by Weidner and Kroupa
(2006). We argue that rather than signaling the violation of the random
sampling model these observations reflect the gravitationally unstable nature
of systems with one very large mass star. We stress the importance of the

scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or
entrained air in the water can significantly modify wave impacts. When air is
entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the
water change dramatically and for example the speed of sound in the mixture is
much smaller than in pure water, and even smaller than in pure air. While some
work has been done to study small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures,
little work has been done on large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We
propose a basic two-fluid model in which both fluids share the same velocities.
It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water wave impacts on
coastal structures. Even though this is a model without interface, waves can
occur. Their dispersion relation is discussed and the formal limit of pure
phases (interfacial waves) is considered. The governing equations are

predict the dependence on the semiflexibility parameter $\beta = L/L_P$ of this
extra contribution to the free energy which shows up as an area in the
torque-link plane. This can be tested against future torque-link experiments
with single biopolymers. We bring out the inequivalence of torque-link curves
for a stiff polymer and present explicit analytical expressions for the {\it
distinct} torque-link relations in the two ensembles and the free energy
difference in switching ensembles in this context. The predictions of our work
can be tested against single molecule experiments on torsionally constrained
biopolymers.

the interparticle interaction influences the temperature dependence of a

results show that the J/psi polarization status drastically changes from
transverse polarization dominant at LO into longitudinal polarization dominant
in the whole range of the transverse momentum $p_t$ of J/psi when the NLO
corrections are counted. For Upsilon production, the p_t distribution of the
polarization status behaves almost the same as that for J/psi except that the

theoretical evaluation predicts a larger longitudinal polarization than the
measured value at Tevatron, it may provide a solution towards the previous
large discrepancy for J/psi and Upsilon polarization between theoretical
predication and experimental measurement, and suggests that the next important
step is to calculate the NLO corrections to hadronproduction of color octet

sparse mixtures, we present a similar approach to a simplified version of
quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Unlike in case of microarrays, where the
number of tests usually reaches tens of thousands, the number of tests
performed in scans for QTL usually does not exceed several hundreds. However,
in typical cases, the sparsity $p$ of significant alternatives for QTL mapping
is in the same range as for microarrays. For methodological interest, as well
as some related applications, we also consider non-sparse mixtures. Using
simulations as well as theoretical observations we study false discovery rate
(FDR), power and misclassification probability for the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure and its modifications, as well as for various parametric and
nonparametric Bayes and Parametric Empirical Bayes procedures. Our results
confirm the observation of Genovese and Wasserman (2002) that for small p the
misclassification error of BH is close to optimal in the sense of attaining the
Bayes oracle. This property is shared by some of the considered Bayes testing
rules, which in general perform better than BH for large or moderate $p$'s.

The statistical challenge one encounters is that the likelihood function is not

conventional asymptotic properties for the maximum likelihood estimators fail
to hold in this situation. In this paper, we propose an estimating procedure

  So, we introduce the notion of combinatorial cube packing, which instead of

expansion of the packing density in powers of $\frac{1}{N}$. The explicit

growth of supermassive black holes in the Universe. We solve the continuity
equation for SMBH mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary
condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth
rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric
correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous
semi-analytic and numerical models, we do not assume any specific distribution
of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass
and luminosity functions. SMBH show a very broad accretion rate distribution,
and we discuss the consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed
AGN fractions in galaxies. We confirm previous results and demonstrate that, at
least for z<1.5, SMBH mass function evolves anti-hierarchically, i.e. the most
massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first
time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts
above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z~2). We also derive
tight constraints on the (mass weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN:
we find that 0.065<\xi_0 \epsilon_{rad}< 0.07$, where \xi_0 is the local SMBH
mass density in units of 4.3x10^5 M_sun Mpc^{-3}. We trace the cosmological
evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall
efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power,
ranges between 3 and 5 \times 10^{-3}. Such a ``kinetic efficiency'' varies
however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive

Landau level are given by functions called conformal blocks, taken from some
conformal field theory. Also, wavefunctions for certain paired states of
fermions in two dimensions, such as p_x+ip_y states, reduce to such a form at
long distances. Here we investigate the adiabatic transport of such
many-particle trial wavefunctions using methods from two-dimensional field
theory. One context for this is to calculate the statistics of widely-separated
quasiholes, which has been predicted to be non-Abelian in a variety of cases.
The Berry phase or matrix (holonomy) resulting from adiabatic transport around
a closed loop in parameter space is the same as the effect of analytic
continuation around the same loop with the particle coordinates held fixed
(monodromy), provided the trial functions are orthonormal and holomorphic in
the parameters so that the Berry vector potential (or connection) vanishes. We
show that this is the case (up to a simple area term) for paired states
(including the Moore-Read quantum Hall state), and present general conditions
for it to hold for other trial states (such as the Read-Rezayi series). We
argue that trial states based on a non-unitary conformal field theory do not
describe a gapped topological phase, at least in many cases. By considering
adiabatic variation of the aspect ratio of the torus, we calculate the Hall
viscosity, a non-dissipative viscosity coefficient analogous to Hall
conductivity, for paired states, Laughlin states, and more general quantum Hall
states. Hall viscosity is an invariant within a topological phase, and is
generally proportional to the ""conformal spin density"" in the ground state.

is shown that every bimodule herd gives rise to a pair of corings and

sufficient conditions for the derived rings to be isomorphic to $A$ and $B$ are

Complex-orbital, e.g., 1/sqrt(2)[|zx> + i |yz>], ordered (COO) states having
noncollinear orbital moments ~ 0.4 mu_B on the B sites are obtained with the
cubic lattice structure of the high-temperature phase. The COO state is a novel
form of magnetic ordering within the orbital degree of freedom. It arises from
the formation of Hund's second rule states of spinless pseudo-d molecular
orbitals in the Fe_4 tetrahedral units of the B sites and ferromagnetic
alignment of their fictitious orbital moments. A COO state with longer
periodicity is obtained with pseudo-orthorhombic Pmca and Pmc2_1 structures for
the low-temperature phase. The state spontaneously lowers the crystal symmetry
to the monoclinic and explains experimentally observed rhombohedral cell
deformation and Jahn-Teller like distortion. From these findings, we consider
that at the Verwey transition temperature, the COO state remaining to be
short-range order impeded by dynamical lattice distortion in high temperature
is developed into that with long-range order coupled with the monoclinic
lattice distortion.

mean number of mutations per site per generation. There are many estimators of
$\theta$, one of them being the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences,
which we call $\mathcal{T}_2$. Other estimators are $\mathcal{T}_1$, based on
the number of segregating sites and $\mathcal{T}_3$, based on the number of

differentiated nucleotide distribution for mutant sites when compared to the
overall nucleotide distribution. Tajima (1989) has proposed the so-called
Tajima's test of selective neutrality based on $\mathcal{T}_2-\mathcal{T}_1$.
Its complex empirical behavior (Kiihl, 2005) motivates us to propose a test

the polymers and leads to an energy proportional to the contact surface between
the tube and solvent particles. The solvent molecules are modeled as hard
spheres and the two interactions are considered separately with the solvent
density affecting their relative strength. In addition to analytical
calculations, we present the results of numerical simulations in order to
understand the role played by the finite length of short polymers and the
discrete versus continuum descriptions of the system in determining the
preferred conformation.

Tracking'') to generate predefined arbitrarily shaped 2-dimensional arrays of
cells by means of evolutionary techniques. It is based on a model of
development, whose key features are: i) the distinction bewteen ``normal'' and
``driver'' cells, being the latter able to receive guidance from the genome,
ii) the implementation of the proliferation/apoptosis events in such a way that
many cells are created/deleted at once, in order to speed-up the morphogenetic
process. iii) the presence in driver cells of an epigenetic memory, that holds
the position of the cell in the cell lineage tree and represents the source of
differentiation during development. The experiments performed with a number of
100x100 black and white and colour target shapes (the horse, the couple, the
hand, the dolphin, the map of Britain, the foot, the frog, the baby, the
stomach, the french flag, the head) bring to the conclusion that the method
described is able to generate any target shape, outperforming any other known
method in terms of size and variety of the generated shapes. The interpretation
of the proposed method as a model of embryogenesis and its biological

been proposed as the contour of the bubbles interaction zone around 70 pc. Our
goal is to identify the interface between the Local and Loop I Bubbles and
discuss the ring's existence using Stromgren uvbyH\beta data. We have used the
uvbyH\beta data of the General Catalogue of Photometric Data, covering the
region defined by the Galactic coordinates: 250\degr <= l <= 50\degr and
-60\degr <= b <= 60\degr to obtain E(b-y) colour excess and distances. The
final sample is composed of 4346 stars located up to 500 pc from the Sun.
  The expected transition to E(b-y) ~ 0.070 - 0.100 mag, corresponding to the
ring's column density, occurs on the western part of the ring at d = 110 +/- 20
pc, whereas on the eastern side it is not clearly seen before d = 280 +/- 50
pc. Near the Galactic plane the presence of the dark clouds is clearly
established by E(b-y) >= 0.100 mag on the western side at about 100 - 150 pc
and about 120 - 180 pc on the eastern side. In the southernmost part of the
ring the reddening remains very low, typically E(b-y) = 0.020 in all its
extension, except towards the Mensa constellation where a possible transition
is observed at d = 200 +/- 20 pc. In the northernmost part the colour excess
increases with distance in a gradual way, such that 0.020 <= E(b-y) <= 0.040
mag becomes predominant only after d=120 +/-15 pc.
  If the ring really exists the colour excess distribution indicates that it is
very fragmented and distorted. However, the different characteristics of the
reddening inside and along the ring do not support the existence of a ring.

with orbital angular momentum in left-handed materials (LHMs). We demonstrate
that the rotational Doppler effect in LHMs is unreversed, which is
significantly different from the linear Doppler effect. The physics underlying
this intriguing effect is the combined contributions of negative phase velocity
and inverse screw of wave-front. In the normal dispersion region, the
rotational Doppler effect induces a upstream energy flow but a downstream
momentum flow. In the anomalous dispersion region, however, the rotational
Doppler effect produces a downstream energy flow but a upstream momentum flow.
We theoretically predict that the rotational Doppler effect can induce a
transfer of angular momentum of the LHM to orbital angular momentum of the

tracers of halo mass from galactic- to cluster-size halos. In this analysis we
use 170,640 isolated ~L* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38,236
groups traced by isolated spectroscopic Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and 13,823
MaxBCG clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) covering a wide range
of richness. Together these three samples allow a determination of the density
profiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from
10^{12} M_{sun} to 10^{15} M_{sun}. The resulting lensing signal is consistent
with an NFW or Einasto profile on scales outside the central region. We find
that the NFW concentration parameter c_{200b} decreases with halo mass, from
around 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. Assuming its dependence on
halo mass in the form of c_{200b} = c_0 [M/(10^{14}M_{sun}/h)]^{\beta}, we find
c_0=4.6 +/- 0.7 (at z=0.22) and \beta=0.13 +/- 0.07, with very similar results
for the Einasto profile. The slope (\beta) is in agreement with theoretical
predictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below the
predictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published values
in the literature differ at a level of 10-20% and that for a proper comparison
our analysis should be repeated in simulations. We discuss the implications of
our results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since these
are expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see no
evidence of high concentrations on scales above 20% of the virial radius
suggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not a
significant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements of
the dark matter power spectrum. [ABRIDGED]

by red supergiants, and hence to be old enough to have survived the earliest
phases of cluster evolution when the interstellar medium is rapidly swept out
from the cluster, supported by the fact that there is no obvious Halpha
emission associated with the clusters. All but one of the Antennae clusters
have dynamical and photometric mass estimates which are within a factor ~2 of
one another, implying both that standard IMFs provide a good approximation to
the IMF of these clusters, and that there is no significant extra-virial
motion, as would be expected if they were rapidly dispersing. These results
suggest that almost all of the Antennae clusters in our sample have survived
the gas removal phase as bound or marginally bound objects. Two of the three
NGC 1487 clusters studied here have M_dyn estimates which are significantly
larger than the photometric mass estimates. At least one of these two clusters,
and one in the Antennae, may be actively in the process of dissolving. The
process of dissolution contributes a component of non-virial motion to the
integrated velocity measurements, resulting in an estimated M_dyn which is too

candidates in both galaxies are amongst the clusters with the lowest

devoted to a particular magic number. It describes the underlying physics of

regular $K$-algebra $Q_K(\mathbb P)$ in a functorial way. We show that the
monoid of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective $Q_K(\mathbb
P)$-modules is the abelian monoid generated by $\mathbb P$ with the only
relations given by $p=p+q$ whenever $q<p$ in $\mathbb P$. This extends the
class of monoids for which there is a positive solution to the realization
problem for von Neumann regular rings.

with special attention to the recently produced pair-ion plasma containing ions
of equal mass and opposite charge. The effects of the density gradient in the
direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field vector, observed in the
experiment, are discussed. In addition, the possible presence of electrons is
discussed in the context of plasma modes propagating at an angle with respect
to the magnetic field vector. The electrons may either be added to the plasma
or enter the plasma attached to negative ions and then become released from the
ions as a result of collisions. It is shown that the electron plasma mode in a
cold plasma may become a backward mode in the presence of a density gradient,
and this behavior may be controlled either by the electron number density or
the mode number in the perpendicular direction. In plasmas with hot electrons
an instability may develop, driven by the combination of electron collisions
and the density gradient, and in the regime when the ions' response is similar
to a sound mode, i.e., for un-magnetized ions, implying mode frequencies much
above the ion gyro-frequency or mode wave-lengths shorter than the ion
gyro-radius. In the case of a pure pair-ion plasma, for lower frequencies and
for parameters close to those used in the recent experiments, the perturbed
ions may feel the effects of the magnetic field. In this case the plasma mode
also becomes backward, resembling features of an experimentally observed but
yet unexplained backward mode.

thermodynamic and structural properties upon supercooling of a low
concentration sodium chloride solution in TIP4P water and the comparison with
the corresponding bulk quantities. We study the isotherms and the isochores for
both the aqueous solution and bulk water. The comparison of the phase diagrams
shows that thermodynamic properties of the solution are not merely shifted with
respect to the bulk. Moreover, from the analysis of the thermodynamic curves,
both the spinodal line and the temperatures of maximum density curve can be
calculated. The spinodal line appears not to be influenced by the presence of
ions at the chosen concentration, while the temperatures of maximum density
curve displays both a mild shift in temperature and a shape modification with
respect to bulk. Signatures of the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point
are found in the aqueous solution. By analysing the water-ion radial
distribution functions of the aqueous solution we observe that upon changing
density, structural modifications appear close to the spinodal. For low
temperatures additional modifications appear also for densities close to that
corresponding to a low density configurational energy minimum.

ion response in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, which
appears due to friction with electrons and which can not be omitted in view of
the momentum conservation. A modified instability threshold is obtained. In
plasmas with dominant electron collisions with neutrals, the instability
threshold is shifted towards higher frequencies, compared to the case of
dominant electron collisions with ions. The difference between the two cases
vanishes when the ion sound response is negligible, i.e., when the instability
threshold disappears, and both ions and neutrals react to the electron friction
in the same manner.

  Types of K and M Subdwarfs","84 pages, 35 figures, accepted to AJ",,"10.1088/0004-6256/136/2/840",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using new spectra of 88 K and M-type subdwarfs, we consider novel methods for
assigning their spectral types and take steps toward developing a comprehensive
spectral sequence for subdwarf types K3.0 to M6.0. The types are assigned based
on the overall morphology of spectra covering 6000\AA to 9000\AA. The types and
sequence presented link the spectral types of cool subdwarfs to their main
sequence counterparts, with emphasis on the relatively opacity-free region from
8200--9000\AA. When available, supporting abundance, kinematic, and
trigonometric parallax information is used to provide more complete portraits
of the observed subdwarfs. We find that the CaHn (n $=$ 1--3) and TiO5 indices
often used for subdwarf spectral typing are affected in complicated ways by
combinations of subdwarfs' temperatures, metallicities, and gravities, and we
use model grids to evaluate the trends in all three parameters. Because of the
complex interplay of these three characteristics, it is not possible to
identify a star as an ``extreme'' subdwarf simply based on very low
metallicity, and we suggest that the modifiers ``extreme'' or ``ultra'' only
outline locations on spectroscopic indices plots, and should not be used to
imply low or very low metallicity stars. In addition, we propose that ``VI'' be
used to identify a star as a subdwarf, rather than the confusing ``sd'' prefix,
which is also used for hot O and B subdwarfs that are unrelated to the cool
subdwarfs discussed in this paper.
