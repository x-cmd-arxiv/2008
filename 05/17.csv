specific cases showing discrimination of look-alike models in simulated data
sets that are at least 10 to 100 times smaller than used in previous studies.
We discriminate supersymmetry models from non-supersymmetric look-alikes with

This
energy is within the range of laser-based investigations that could allow
accurate measurements of possible temporal variation of this energy splitting.
This in turn could probe temporal variation of the fine-structure constant or
other parameters in the nuclear Hamiltonian. We investigate the sensitivity of
this transition energy to these quantities. We find that the two states are
predicted to have identical deformations and thus the same Coulomb energies
within the accuracy of the model (viz., within roughly 30 keV). We therefore
find no enhanced sensitivity to variation of the fine-structure constant. In
the case of the strong interaction the energy splitting is found to have a
complicated dependence on several parameters of the interaction, which makes an
accurate prediction of sensitivity to temporal changes of fundamental constants
problematical. Neither the strong- nor Coulomb-interaction contributions to the
energy splitting of this doublet can be constrained within an accuracy better
than a few tens of keV, so that only upper limits can be set on the possible
sensitivity to temporal variations of the fundamental constants.

interpreted as the poles of the retarded Green functions of the dual N=4 gauge
theory at finite temperature. The response to a generic perturbation is
determined by the residues of the poles. We compute these residues numerically
for energy-momentum and R-charge correlators. We find that the diffusion modes
behave in a similar way: at small wavelengths the residues go over into a form
of a damped oscillation and therefore these modes decouple at short distances.
The sound mode behaves differently: its residue does not decay and at short
wavelengths this mode behaves as the higher quasinormal modes. Applications of
our findings include the definition of hydrodynamic length and time scales. We
also show that the quasinormal modes, including the hydrodynamic diffusion

Optical/UV observations are particularly useful for such studies because they
allow one to explore both thermal and non-thermal emission processes. In
particular, studying the optical/UV emission constrains temperature of the bulk
of the neutron star surface, too cold to be measured in X-ray observations.Aim
of this work is to identify the optical counterpart of the very old (166 Myr)
radio pulsar J0108-1431. We have re-analyzed our original VLT observations
(Mignani et al. 2003), where a very faint object was tentatively detected close
to the radio position, near the edge of a field galaxy. We found that the
backward extrapolation of the PSR J0108-1431 proper motion recently measured by
CHANDRA(Pavlov et al. 2008) nicely fits the position of this object. Based on
that, we propose it as a viable candidate for the optical counterpart to PSR
J0108-1431. The object fluxes (U =26.4+/-0.3; B =27.9; V >27.8) are consistent

connectivity of the natural map (C_{min} E)//G(E) --> Map^E (M, BU(n)) from the
homotopy orbits of the space of central Yang-Mills connections to the
classifying space of the gauge group G(E). All of these results carry over to
non-orientable surfaces via Ho and Liu's non-orientable Yang-Mills theory.

noted that this matrix cannot always be diagonalized. It can however be brought
by rotation to a matrix with equal diagonal elements. This equi-diagonal matrix
can then be squeeze-transformed to a rotation, to a squeeze, or to one of the
two shear matrices. It is noted that these one-parameter matrices constitute
the basic elements of the Wigner's little group for space-time symmetries of

transformation of one of the Wigner matrices, while the transformation matrix
is a rotation preceded by a squeeze. This mathematical property enables us to
compute scattering processes in periodic systems. Laser cavities and multilayer
optics are discussed in detail. For both cases, it is shown possible to write

the efficiency of mixing in the solar nebula or the timing of 60Fe injection

flux of high energy cosmic rays and of accompanying secondary photons and

basic models for the generation of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) shock
acceleration in the radio jet and acceleration in the regular electromagnetic
field close to the core of the AGN. While scattering on photons dominates in
scenarios with acceleration close to the core, scattering on gas becomes more
important if acceleration takes place along the jet. Normalizing the UHECR flux
from Centaurus A to the observations of the Auger experiment, the neutrino flux
may be marginally observable in a 1 km$^3$ neutrino telescope, if a steep UHECR
flux $\d N/\d E\propto E^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2.7$ extends down to $10^{17}$
eV. The associated photon flux is close to or exceeds the observational data of
atmospheric Cherenkov and $\gamma$-ray telescopes for $\alpha\gsim 2$. In

known to impart recoil velocities of up to ~1000 km/s to the remnant black
hole. In this context, we study the motion of a recoiling black hole inside a
galaxy modelled as an Hernquist sphere, and the signature that the hole
imprints on the hot gas, using N-body/SPH simulations. Ejection of the black
hole results in a sudden expansion of the gas ending with the formation of a
gaseous core, similarly to what is seen for the stars. A cometary tail of
particles bound to the black hole is initially released along its trail. As the
black hole moves on a return orbit, a nearly spherical swarm of hot gaseous
particles forms at every apocentre: this feature can live up to ~ 100 Myr. If
the recoil velocity exceeds the sound speed initially, the black hole shocks
the gas in the form of a Mach cone in density near each super-sonic pericentric
passage. We find that the X-ray fingerprint of a recoiling black hole can be
detected in Chandra X-ray maps out to a distance of Virgo. For exceptionally
massive black holes the Mach cone and the wakes could be observed out to a few
hundred of Mpc. Detection of the Mach cone is found to become of twofold
importance: i) as a probe of high-velocity recoils and ii) as an assessment of
the scatter of the mass-sigma relation at large black hole masses.

and stellar mass using data for over 100,000 objects from Galaxy Zoo, the
largest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. We
conclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very different
functions of environment. Both are sensitive to stellar mass; however, at fixed
stellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphology
displays much weaker environmental trends. Only a small part of both relations
can be attributed to variation in the stellar mass function with environment.
Galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red, in all environments and
irrespective of their morphology. Low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue in
low-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, again
irrespective of their morphology. The colour-density relation is primarily
driven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular the
fraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at low
stellar masses. We demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxies
with true spiral morphology. We clearly show there is an environmental
dependence for colour beyond that for morphology. Before using the Galaxy Zoo
morphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-,
size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this dataset, and
probably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. A correction for
this bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliable
morphological type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis.

stars and three cataclysmic variables. We derive distances, X-ray and

gap between the nearby stars identified by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the
more distant stars detected in deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. For 36
newly identified X-ray emitting M stars we calculate L_(Halpha)/L_(bol).
L_(H\alpha)/L_(bol) and L_(X)/L_(bol) are linearly related below L_(X)/L_(bol)
~ 3 x 10^(-4), while L_(Halpha)/L_(bol) appears to turn over at larger
L_(X)/L_(bol) values. Stars with reliable SDSS photometry have an ~0.1 mag blue
excess in (u-g), likely due to increased chromospheric continuum emission.
Photometric metallicity estimates suggest the sample is split between the young

the old disk population, a clear signature of the decay of magnetic activity
with age. Future papers will present analyses of source variability and
comparisons of this catalog to models of stellar activity in the Galactic disk.

model of the interstellar medium comprises optically-thin radiative cooling, an
external gravitational potential, and background shear. Dynamo coefficients for
mean-field models are measured by means of passive test fields. Our simulations
show that supernova-driven turbulence in conjunction with shear leads to an
exponential amplification of the mean magnetic field. We found turbulent

performance variability due to statistical process and circuit parameter
variations is becoming more and more significant. Considerable effort has been
expended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope
with the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been
aimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In
this paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo
method for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method
is widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing
yield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not
be used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly
full circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing
yield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,
but at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator
is based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance
sampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for
cheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that
our improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte
Carlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.

decoding for linear dispersive space-time block codes (STBC) and a design
criterion for the codes to achieve full diversity when the PIC group decoding
is used at the receiver. A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in
an STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately
after a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an
intermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes
all the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a
single group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded
symbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one
embedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. Our proposed design
criterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an
intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords
and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the
equivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotically optimal (AO) group
decoding algorithm, which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding
algorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group
decoding applies to the AO group decoding algorithm. It is well-known that the
symbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n_t for n_t transmit
antennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a
code achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion
proposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n_t
and 1 that achieve full diversity with a PIC group decoding. This therefore
provides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.

electrons that creates electron pairs which condense into a macroscopic quantum
state--the superconducting state. On the other hand, magnetic order in a metal
arises from electrons localized close to the ionic core and whose interaction
is mediated by itinerant electrons. The dichotomy between local moment magnetic
order and superconductivity raises the question of whether these two states can
coexist and involve the same electrons. Here we show that the single
4f-electron of cerium in CeRhIn5 simultaneously produces magnetism,
characteristic of localization, and superconductivity that requires itinerancy.
The dual nature of the 4f-electron allows microscopic coexistence of
antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity whose competition is tuned by
small changes in pressure and magnetic field. Electronic duality contrasts with
conventional interpretations of coexisting spin-density magnetism and
superconductivity and offers a new avenue for understanding complex states in
classes of materials.

before dumping them, so that their energy is available for the acceleration of
new particles. During this deceleration, any relative energy spread that is
created at high energy is amplified by the ratio between high energy and dump
energy. Therefore, Energy Recovery Linacs are sensitive to energy spread
acquired at high energy, e.g. from wake fields. One can compensate the
time-correlated energy spread due to wakes via energy-dependent time-of-flight
terms in appropriate sections of an Energy Recovery Linac, and via
high-frequency cavities. We show that nonlinear time-of-flight terms can only
eliminate odd orders in the correlation between time and energy, if these terms
are created by a beam transport within the linac that is common for
accelerating and decelerating beams. If these two beams are separated, so that
different beam transport sections can be used to produce time-of-flight terms
suitable for each, also even-order terms in the energy spread can be
eliminated. As an example, we investigate the potential of using this method
for the Cornell x-ray Energy Recovery Linac. Via quadratic time-of-flight
terms, the energy spread can be reduced by 66%. Alternatively, since the energy
spread from the dominantly resistive wake fields of the analysed accelerator is
approximately harmonic in time, a high-frequency cavity could diminish the
energy spread by 81%. This approach would require bunch-lengthening and
recompression in separate sections for accelerating and decelerating beams.
Such sections have therefore been included in Cornell's x-ray Energy Recovery
Linac design.

spikier and its average width grows linearly with time; for $\mu = 0$, its
width grows as $\sqrt{t}$. On the other hand, for positive $\mu$, the surface
width shows the standard scaling behavior, $\la \sigma_m(t)\ra \sim
M^{\alpha}f(t/M^{\alpha /\beta})$ where $M$ is the substrate size and $f(x) \to

conception of standard cosmological model has its roots in this context. The
paper relates to the methodological status of effective theories in the context
of cosmological investigations. We argue that the standard cosmological model
(LCDM model) as well as the CDM have a status of effective theories only,
similarly to the standard model of particle physics. The LCDM model is studied
from the point of view of the methodological debate on reductionism and
epistemological emergence in the science. It is shown in the paper that
bifurcation as well as structural instability notion can be useful in the
detection of emergence the LCDM model from the CDM model. We demonstrate that
the structural stability of the LCDM model can explain the flexibility of the
model to accommodation of the observational data. We show that LCDM model can
be derived from CDM as the bifurcation. It is an example of acausal derivation
of Lambda term. The case study of emergence of LCDM model suggests that it can
be understood in terms of bifurcation and structural stability issue. The
reduction from the upper models represented in terms of dynamical system to
low-level ones can be realized in any case by application of a mathematical
limit (boundary crossing) with respect to the model parameter. It is a simple
consequence of mathematical theorem about smooth dependence solutions with

as seen from inside the halo. This effect could provide an alternative
explanation of the dark-matter phenomenon in galaxies. In this case, the local
cosmological constant in the solar system must be some six orders of magnitude
larger than its cosmic value obtained in the supernovae type Ia experiments.

top of the AGN continuum, we detect PAH emission from luminous star formation
in nine objects individually as well as in the composite spectrum for the full

extend the similar correlation for lower luminosity local QSOs. This provides
strong evidence for intense star formation in the hosts of these mm-bright

far-infrared emission. The PAH-based limit on star formation rates is lower for
luminous z~2 QSOs that are not preselected for their mm emission. Partly
dependent on systematic changes of the AGN dust covering factor and the dust
spectral energy distribution of the AGN proper, the spectral energy
distributions of mm-faint high-z QSOs may be AGN dominated out to rest frame
far-infrared wavelengths. Towards the most luminous high-z QSOs, there is a
flattening of the relation between star formation and AGN luminosity that is

  Control Problem",,,,,"cs.NI cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Achieving weighted throughput maximization (WTM) through power control has
been a long standing open problem in interference-limited wireless networks.
The complicated coupling between the mutual interferences of links gives rise
to a non-convex optimization problem. Previous work has considered the WTM
problem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where
the problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization
problem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime,
however, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This
paper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global
optimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL
algorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1)
the objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective
function can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction
functions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is
always normal although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the
desired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks
that approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore,
by tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable
tradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important
benchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting
the same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of
several respective algorithms through extensive simulations.

the exactly solvable critical $q$-state Potts model on the honeycomb lattice

the honeycomb lattice, and a fully packed loop model with loop weight
$n'=\sqrt{q}$ and a dilute loop model with loop weight $n$, both on the kagome

of the dilute O($n$) model, as well as some of its critical properties. For
$n=0$, this model reproduces the known universal properties of the $\theta$

new way of recognizing the symplectic groups from a small collection of small
subgroups.

Its
applications range from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to photonic
quantum information processing, where a significant fraction of key experiments
achieved so far comes from multi-photon state manipulation. We review the
progress, both theoretical and experimental, of this rapidly advancing
research. The emphasis is given to the creation of photonic entanglement of
various forms, tests of the completeness of quantum mechanics (in particular,
violations of local realism), quantum information protocols for quantum
communication (e.g., quantum teleportation, entanglement purification and
quantum repeater), and quantum computation with linear optics. We shall limit
the scope of our review to ""few photon"" phenomena involving measurements of
discrete observables.
