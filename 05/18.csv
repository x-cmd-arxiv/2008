  http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3525",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The celebrated multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory models the basic
trade-off between exploration, or learning about the state of a system, and
exploitation, or utilizing the system. In this paper we study the variant of
the multi-armed bandit problem where the exploration phase involves costly
experiments and occurs before the exploitation phase; and where each play of an
arm during the exploration phase updates a prior belief about the arm. The
problem of finding an inexpensive exploration strategy to optimize a certain
exploitation objective is NP-Hard even when a single play reveals all
information about an arm, and all exploration steps cost the same.
  We provide the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm
for this class of problems. We show that this framework also generalizes
several problems of interest studied in the context of data acquisition in
sensor networks. Our analyses also extends to switching and setup costs, and to
concave utility objectives.
  Our solution approach is via a novel linear program rounding technique based
on stochastic packing. In addition to yielding exploration policies whose
performance is within a small constant factor of the adaptive optimal policy, a
nice feature of this approach is that the resulting policies explore the arms
sequentially without revisiting any arm. Sequentiality is a well-studied
concept in decision theory, and is very desirable in domains where multiple
explorations can be conducted in parallel, for instance, in the sensor network
context.

Phaethon-Geminid stream complex (Ohtsuka et al. 2008). Here, we present
photometric observations taken to determine the physical properties of 1999 YC.
The object shows a nearly neutral reflection spectrum, similar to but slightly
redder than related objects 3200 Phaethon and 2005 UD. Assuming an albedo equal
to 3200 Phaethon's we find that the diameter is 1.4+/-0.1 km. Time-resolved
broad-band photometry yields a double-peaked rotational period of
4.4950+/-0.0010 hr while the range of the lightcurve indicates an elongated
shape having a projected axis ratio near 1.9:1. Surface brightness models
provide no evidence of lasting mass loss of the kind seen in active short
period cometary nuclei. An upper limit to the mass loss is set at about 0.001
kg/s, corresponding to an upper limit on the fraction of the surface that could
be sublimating water ice of 0.001. If sustained over the 1000 yr age of the
Geminid stream, the total mass loss from 1999 YC (3e7 kg) would be small
compared to the reported stream mass (1e12 - 1e13 kg), suggesting that the
stream is the product of catastrophic, rather than steady-state, breakup of the
parent object.

  It is of great interest in areas such as Computer Graphics, CAD applications,
Spatial Databases and GIS developing tasks. In this paper we study the problem
of canonical $k$-vertex polygon queries on the plane. A canonical $k$-vertex
polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval
query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of
vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and
triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its
edges are axis-parallel).
  We present two new algorithms for this problem. The first one requires
$O(n\log^2{n})$ space and $O(k\frac{log^3n}{loglogn}+A)$ query time. A simple
modification scheme on first algorithm lead us to a second solution, which
consumes $O(n^2)$ space and $O(k \frac{logn}{loglogn}+A)$ query time, where $A$
denotes the size of the answer and $k$ is the number of vertices.
  The best previous solution for the general polygon retrieval problem uses
$O(n^2)$ space and answers a query in $O(k\log{n}+A)$ time, where $k$ is the
number of vertices. It is also very complicated and difficult to be implemented
in a standard imperative programming language such as C or C++.

moderately active star, and its corona differs from active stars: active
stellar coronae have a double-peaked EM(T) with the hot peak at 8-20 MK, while
the non flaring solar corona has one peak at 1-2 MK. We study the average
contribution of flares to the solar EM(T) to investigate indirectly the
hypothesis that the hot peak of the EM(T) of active stellar coronae is due to a
large number of unresolved solar-like flares, and to infer properties on the
flare distribution from nano- to macro-flares. We measure the disk-integrated
time-averaged emission measure, EM_F(T), of an unbiased sample of solar flares
analyzing uninterrupted GOES/XRS light curves over time intervals of one month.
We obtain the EM_Q(T) of quiescent corona for the same time intervals from the
Yohkoh/SXT data. To investigate how EM_F(T) and EM_Q(T) vary with the solar
cycle, we evaluate them at different phases of the cycle (from Dec. 1991 to
Apr. 1998). Irrespective of the solar cycle phase, EM_F(T) appears like a peak
of the distribution significantly larger than the values of EM_Q(T) for T~5-10
MK. As a result the time-averaged EM(T) of the whole solar corona is
double-peaked, with the hot peak, due to time-averaged flares, located at
temperature similar of that of active stars, but less enhanced. The EM_F(T)
shape supports the hypothesis that the hot EM(T) peak of active coronae is due
to unresolved solar-like flares. If this is the case, quiescent and flare
components should follow different scaling laws for increasing stellar
activity. In the assumption that the heating of the corona is entirely due to
flares, from nano- to macro-flares, then either the flare distribution or the
confined plasma response to flares, or both, are bimodal.

resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity. We resolved the distance ambiguity

(2) the very hot material within a much larger region called the Local Bubble
(LB), has troubled astronomers for over two decades. A possible resolution of
this problem, at least in part, now seems possible. We now understand that
earlier estimates for the average electron density in the very hot LB plasma
were inflated by an unrecognized foreground contamination to the low energy
diffuse X-ray background measurements. This foreground illumination arises from
photons emitted by charge exchange reactions between solar wind ions and
neutral atoms from the interstellar medium that enter into the heliosphere.
However, with the resolution of this problem comes a new one. The high
ionization fraction of helium in the CHISM, relative to that of hydrogen, could
be understood in terms of the effects from a strong flux of EUV and X-ray
radiation coming from both the Local Bubble and a conductive interface around
the CHISM. A revision of this interpretation may now be in order, now that the
photoionization rate from radiation emitted by hot gas the Local Bubble is
lower than previously assumed.

$x \in G$ from given $g \in G$ and $h=x^{-1}gx$. The alleged computational
hardness of this problem in some groups was used in several recently suggested
public key exchange protocols, including the one due to Anshel, Anshel, and
Goldfeld, and the one due to Ko, Lee et al. Sibert, Dehornoy, and Girault used
this problem in their authentication scheme, which was inspired by the
Fiat-Shamir scheme involving repeating several times a three-pass
challenge-response step.
  In this paper, we offer an authentication scheme whose security is based on
the apparent hardness of the twisted conjugacy search problem, which is: given
a pair of endomorphisms (i.e., homomorphisms into itself) phi, \psi of a group
G and a pair of elements w, t \in G, find an element s \in G such that t =
\psi(s^{-1}) w \phi(s) provided at least one such s exists. This problem
appears to be very non-trivial even for free groups. We offer here another
platform, namely, the semigroup of all 2x2 matrices over truncated one-variable
polynomials over F_2, the field of two elements, with transposition used
instead of inversion in the equality above.

opposite effect has been recently observed: ferromagnetism appears in some
nano-sized manganites with a composition such that the antiferromagnetic
charge-ordered CE state is observed in the bulk. A possible origin is the
development of ferromagnetic correlations at the surface of these small
systems. To clarify these puzzling experimental observations, we have studied
the two-orbital double-exchange model near half-doping n=0.5, using open
boundary conditions to simulate the surface of either bulk or nano-sized
manganites. Considering the enhancement of surface charge density due to a
possible AO termination (A = trivalent/divalent ion composite, O = oxygen), an
unexpected surface phase-separated state emerges when the model is studied
using Monte Carlo techniques on small clusters. This tendency suppresses the CE
charge ordering and produces a weak ferromagnetic signal that could explain the
experimental observations.

unstable with respect to the introduction of noise, because the corresponding
polyhedra are geometrically degenerate, whereas the tessellation of the BCC
crystal is topologically stable even against noise of small but finite
intensity. For weak noise, the mean area of the perturbed BCC and FCC crystals
VT increases quadratically with a. In the case of perturbed SCC crystals, there
is an optimal amount of noise that minimizes the mean area of the cells.
Already for a moderate noise (a>0.5), the properties of the three perturbed VT
are indistinguishable, and for intense noise (a>2), results converge to the
Poisson-VT limit. Notably, 2-parameter gamma distributions are an excellent
model for the empirical of of all considered properties. The VT of the
perturbed BCC and FCC structures are local maxima for the isoperimetric
quotient, which measures the degre of sphericity of the cells, among space
filling VT. In the BCC case, this suggests a weaker form of the recentluy
disproved Kelvin conjecture. Due to the fluctuations of the shape of the cells,
anomalous scalings with exponents >3/2 is observed between the area and the
volumes of the cells, and, except for the FCC case, also for a->0. In the
Poisson-VT limit, the exponent is about 1.67. As the number of faces is
positively correlated with the sphericity of the cells, the anomalous scaling
is heavily reduced when we perform powerlaw fits separately on cells with a

for the case that toroidal magnetic field strength varies $\propto
\varpi^{2k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$ (here $\varpi$ is the cylindrical radius),
whereas for $k=1$ the neutron stars are stable. After the onset of the
instability, unstable modes grow approximately in the Alfv\'en time scale and,
as a result, a convective motion is excited to change the magnetic field
profile until a new state, which is stable against axisymmetric perturbation,
is reached. We also find that rotation plays a role in stabilization, although
the instability still sets in in the Alfv\'en time scale when the ratio of
magnetic energy to rotational kinetic energy is larger than a critical value
$\sim 0.2$. Implication for the evolution of magnetized protoneutron stars is

property of GEMs- the capability to operate in a cascaded mode and in poorly
quenched gases - and of RPC: the protection against sparks. In this paper will
shortly review our latest achievements in this direction, however the main
focus will be given on a new advanced design that allows to build large area
detectors manufactured by a screen printing technology. The proposed detector,
depending on the applications, can operate either in a GEM mode (electron
multiplications through holes only) or as a hybrid RPC with simultaneous
amplifications in the drift region and in the holes. The possible applications
of this new detector will be discussed.

papers (see \cite{HH}, \cite{HHV}, \cite{V1}, \cite{V2}). It is important to
give conditions when the base ring associated to a transversal polymatroid is
Gorenstein (see \cite{HH}). In \cite{SA} we introduced a class of such base
rings. In this paper we note that an intersection of such base rings
(introduced in \cite{SA}) is Gorenstein and give necessary and sufficient
conditions for the intersection of two base rings from \cite{SA} to be still a
base ring of a transversal polymatroid. Also, we compute the $a$-invariant of
those base rings. The results presented were discovered by extensive computer
algebra experiments performed with {\it{Normaliz}} \cite{BK}.

topological groups occur with great frequency. Of course, in general, these
need not be jointly continuous. In this paper, we exhibit some results of
Banach-Steinhaus type and use these to derive joint continuity from separate
continuity. The setting of convergence groups offers two advantages. First, the
continuous convergence structure is a powerful tool in many duality arguments.
Second, local compactness and first countability, the usual requirements for
joint continuity, are available in much greater abundance for convergence
groups.

a metric in the state space of a C*-algebra. We focus in the reduced algebra of
a discrete group $\Gamma$, and prove some equivalences and relations between
two central objects of this category: the word-length growth (connected with
the degree of the extension of $\Gamma$ when the group is an extension of Z by
a finite group), and the topological equivalence between the w*-topology and
the one introduced with this metric in the state space of $C_r*(\Gamma)$.

models reflect three rather different asymptotics the gauge theory beta

and $\beta\propto-\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling constant.
We then calculate the heavy quark potentials in these models by holographic
methods and find that they can more consistently fit the lattice data relative
to the usual models which do not include the renormalization group improving
effects. But only use the lattice QCD heavy quark potentials as constrains, we
cannot distinguish which kind of infrared asymptotics is the better one.
