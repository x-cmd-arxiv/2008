quantum walks to non-unitary and temperature-dependent dynamics in Liouville

coherence and decoherence processes are explored via a universal measure for
the energy transfer efficiency and its susceptibility. In particular, we
demonstrate that for the FMO complex an effective interplay between free

increase in energy transfer efficiency from about 70% to 99%.

stochastic resonance (SR) in a representative soft matter system. Due to their
extreme susceptibility to weak perturbations soft matter systems appear to be
excellent candidates for the observation of SR. Indeed, we derive generic SR
equations from a polymer stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (LC) cell,
which is a typical soft matter representative constituting one of the basic
components in several electro-optic applications. We generalize these equations
further in order to study an even broader class of qualitatively different
systems, especially disclosing the influence of different types of static
disorder and interaction ranges amongst LC molecules on the SR response. We
determine the required conditions for the observation of SR in the examined
system, and moreover, reveal that a random field type static disorder yields
qualitatively different responses with respect to random dilution, random bond
and spin glass universality classes. In particular, while the latter three
decrease the level of dynamic disorder (Gaussian noise) warranting the optimal
response, the former evokes exactly the opposite effect, hence increasing the
optimal noise level that is needed to resonantly fine-tune the system's
response in accordance with the weak deterministic electric field. These
observations are shown to be independent of the system size and range of
interactions, thus implying their general validity and potentially wide
applicability also within other similar settings. We argue that soft matter
systems might be particularly adequate as a base for different SR-based
sensitive detectors and thus potent candidates for additional theoretical as
well as experimental research in the presently outlined direction.

elementary features of quantum phenomena, such as the statistical nature of
measurements, complementarity, and global gauge invariance. It is shown that
these features can be traced to experimental observations characteristic of
quantum phenomena and to general theoretical principles, and thus can
reasonably be taken as a starting point of the derivation. When appropriately
formulated within an information geometric framework, these features lead to
(i) the abstract quantum formalism for finite-dimensional quantum systems, (ii)
the result of Wigner's theorem, and (iii) the fundamental correspondence rules
of quantum theory, such as the canonical commutation relationships. The
formalism also comes naturally equipped with a metric (and associated measure)
over the space of pure states which is unitarily- and anti-unitarily invariant.
The derivation suggests that the information geometric framework is directly or
indirectly responsible for many of the central structural features of the
quantum formalism, such as the importance of square-roots of probability and
the occurrence of sinusoidal functions of phases in a pure quantum state.
Global gauge invariance is seen to play a crucial role in the emergence of the

$\lambda/\mu$ as the minimum number of bars among the corresponding skew bar
tableaux. While the srank conjecture is not valid for skew partitions, we give
an algorithm to compute the srank.

between late and open bisimulation relations arise from familar logic

receptive field, or a set of linear filters, and a thresholding function, or
gain curve, which determines the firing probability; this is known as a
linear/nonlinear model. In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear
filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a
randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated
issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical
neurons: the slope of the firing rate vs current (f-I) curve changes with the
variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence
between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the
gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical
linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying
system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with
respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from
reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based
model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple
change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models
quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how
both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result
from intrinsic nonlinearity.

pricipal idea, that allows us to specify the theory for Pomeron interactions,
is that the so called soft processes occur at rather short distances

perturbative QCD is valid. The value of the Pomeron slope $\alpha'_\pom $ was
obtained from the fit to experimental data. Using this theoretical approach we
suggest a model that fits all soft data in the ISR-Tevatron energy range, the
total, elastic, single and double diffractive cross sections, including $t$
dependence of the differential elastic cross section, and the mass dependence
of single diffraction. In this model we calculate the survival probability of
diffractive Higgs production, and obtained a value for this observable, which
is smaller than 1% at the LHC energy range.

relatively small, so that there may exist a region where exchanged gluons are
soft and the perturbative treatment may fail, so that the non-perturbative
effect would be significant. We attribute such non-perturbative QCD effects
into the long-distance final state interaction (FSI) which is estimated in this
work. We find that the contribution from the FSI to the branching ratio is
indeed sizable and may span a rather wide range of $10^{-6}\sim 10^{-5}$, and
cover a region where the pQCD prediction has the same order. A more accurate
measurement on its branching ratio may provide important information about the
application region of pQCD and help to clarify the picture of the inelastic
rescattering (i.e. FSI) which is generally believed to play an important role

axisymmetric component, implying that non axisymmetric components of the flow
field were acting. By modeling the induction effect of the spiraling flow
between the blades of the impellers in a kinematic dynamo code, we find that
the axisymmetric magnetic mode is excited and becomes dominant in the vicinity
of the dynamo threshold. % The control parameters are the magnetic Reynolds
number of the mean flow, the coefficient measuring the induction effect,
$\alpha$, and the type of boundary conditions (vacuum for steel impellers and
normal field for soft iron impellers). We show that using realistic values of
$\alpha$, the observed critical magnetic Reynolds number, $Rm^c \approx 32$,
can be reached easily with ferromagnetic boundary conditions. We conjecture
that the dynamo action achieved in this experiment may not be related to the
turbulence in the bulk of the flow, but rather to the alpha effect induced by
the impellers.

giving a high probability that we are detecting true satellites. The search was

both star formation rate and R-band luminosity of the 9 probable satellites.
The Large Magellanic Cloud, however, has a higher R-band luminosity than any of

makers, educators, parents, and students. And, doing so appropriately is likely
to require including constructed response tests in the assessment system. We
examined whether scoring costs and other concerns with using open-end measures
on a large scale (e.g., turnaround time and inter-reader consistency) could be
addressed by machine grading the answers. Analyses with 1359 students from 14
colleges found that two human readers agreed highly with each other in the
scores they assigned to the answers to three types of open-ended questions.
These reader assigned scores also agreed highly with those assigned by a
computer. The correlations of the machine-assigned scores with SAT scores,
college grades, and other measures were comparable to the correlations of these
variables with the hand-assigned scores. Machine scoring did not widen
differences in mean scores between racial/ethnic or gender groups. Our findings
demonstrated that machine scoring can facilitate the use of open-ended
questions in large-scale testing programs by providing a fast, accurate, and
economical way to grade responses.

alternative formulas for dual system estimation and investigate the differences

varying treatment of these imputation counts can result in differences in

Our aim is to derive the kinematics and the physical parameters and to study
how they vary with jet velocity. We use several important diagnostic lines such
as [FeII] 1.644um, 1.600um and H2 2.122um. In the inner jet region of HH34 we
find that both the atomic and molecular gas present two components at high and
low velocity. The [FeII] LVC in HH34 is detected up to large distances from the
source (>1000 AU), at variance with TTauri jets. In H2 2.122um, the LVC and HVC
are spatially separated. We detect, for the first time, the fainter red-shifted
counterpart down to the central source. In HH1, we trace the jet down to ~1""
from the VLA1 driving source: the kinematics of this inner region is again
characterised by the presence of two velocity components, one blue-shifted and
one red-shifted with respect to the source LSR velocity. In the inner HH34 jet
region, ne increases with decreasing velocity. Up to ~10"" from the driving
source, and along the whole HH1 jet an opposite behaviour is observed instead,
with ne increasing with velocity. In both jets the mass flux is carried mainly
by the high-velocity gas. A comparison between the position velocity diagrams
and derived electron densities with models for MHD jet launching mechanisms has
been performed for HH34. While the kinematical characteristics of the line
emission at the jet base can be, at least qualitatively, reproduced by both
X-winds and disc-wind models, none of these models can explain the extent of
the LVC and the dependence of electron density with velocity that we observe.
It is possible that the LVC in HH34 represents gas not directly ejected in the
jet but instead denser ambient gas entrained by the high velocity collimated
jet.

physical systems, are governed by thermally activated transitions out of a
metastable state under the action of a steadily increasing external force. The
main observable in such experiments is the distribution of the forces, at which
the escape events occur. The challenge in interpreting the experimental data is
to relate them to the microscopic system properties. We work out a maximum
likelihood approach and show that it is the optimal method to tackle this
problem. When fitting actual experimental data it is unavoidable to assume some
functional form for the force-dependent escape rate. We consider a quite
general and common such functional form and demonstrate by means of data from a
realistic computer experiment that the maximum number of fit parameters that
can be determined reliably is three. They are related to the force-free escape
rate and the position and height of the activation barrier. Furthermore, the
results for the first two of these fit parameters show little dependence on the
assumption about the manner in which the barrier decreases with the applied
force, while the last one, the barrier height in the absence of force, depends
strongly on this assumption.

we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to ~0.01 mg/ml by
dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as
N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This occurs because the energy required to exfoliate
graphene is balanced by the solvent-graphene interaction for solvents whose
surface energy matches that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual
graphene sheets with yields of up to 12% by mass, using absorption
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The
absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infra-red and
Raman spectroscopies. We can produce conductive, semi-transparent films and
conductive composites. Solution processing of graphene opens up a whole range
of potential large-scale applications from device or sensor fabrication to

in the Lockman Hole, which have optical spectroscopic identifications. We
compare, quantitatively, their variability properties with the properties of
local AGN, and we study the ""variability-luminosity"" relation as a function of
redshift, and the ""variability-redshift"" relation in two luminosity bins. We
use archival data from the last 10 XMM observations of the Lockman Hole field
to extract light curves in the rest frame, 2-10 keV band. We use the
""normalized excess variance"" to quantify the variability amplitude. Using the
latest results regarding the AGN power spectral shape and its dependence on
black hole mass and accretion rate, we are able to compute model
""variability-luminosity"" curves, which we compare with the relations we
observe. When we consider all the sources in our sample, we find that their
variability amplitude decreases with increasing redshift and luminosity. These
global anti-correlations are less pronounced when we split the objects in
various luminosity and redshift bins. We do not find a significant correlation
between variability amplitude and spectral slope. The ""variability-luminosity""
relation that we detect has a larger amplitude when compared to that of local
AGN. We also find that, at a given luminosity, the variability amplitude
increases with redshift up to z~1, and then stays roughly constant. Our results
imply that the AGN X-ray mechanism operates in the same way at all redshifts.
Among objects with the same luminosity in our sample, the black hole mass
decreases and the accretion rate increases with larger redshift.

H-alpha emission line redshifted to z=2.23, and is thus suitable for selecting
'typical' star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at this epoch. The
pilot study was undertaken in the well studied Cosmological Evolution Survey
field (COSMOS) and is already the largest near-infrared narrow-band survey at
this depth, with a line flux limit of F(H-alpha)~10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 over 0.60
square degrees, probing ~220x10^3 Mpc^3 (co-moving) down to a limiting star
formation rate of 30 M_sun/yr (3sigma). In this paper we present the results
from our pilot survey and evaluate the H-alpha luminosity function and estimate
the clustering properties of H-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from 55 detected
galaxies. The integrated luminosity function is used to estimate the volume
averaged star formation rate at z=2.23: SFRD = 0.17^{+0.16}_{-0.09}
M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 for L(H-alpha) > 10^42 erg/s. For the first time, we use the
H-alpha star-formation tracer to reliably constrain SFRD out to z=2.23
demonstrating the rapid increase in SRFD out to this redshift as well as
confirming the flattening in SFRD between z~1-2. In addition to the luminosity
distribution, we analyse the clustering properties of these galaxies. Using the
2-point angular correlation function, we estimate a real space correlation
length of r_0= 4.2^{+0.4}_{-0.2} h^-1 Mpc. In comparison to models of
clustering which take into account bias evolution, we estimate that these

real isolated double points (c.f. \cite{MR-00}). In addition, we characterize
the complex algebraic plane curves such that their coamoebas contain no

GRB (T_90 < 2s) in five years of observation since October 2002. This work
presents the properties of the prompt emission of GRB 070707, which is the
first short hard GRB observed by INTEGRAL. The spectral and temporal properties
of GRB 070707 were determined using the two sensitive coded-mask gamma-ray
instruments on board INTEGRAL, IBIS and SPI. The T_90 duration was 0.8s, and
the spectrum of the prompt emission was obtained by joint deconvolution of IBIS
and SPI data to yield a best fit power-law with photon index alpha = -1.19
+0.14 -0.13, which is consistent with the characteristics of short-hard
gamma-ray bursts. The peak flux over 1 second was 1.79 photons/cm^2/s and the
fluence over the same interval was 2.07 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 in the energy range
20-200keV. The spectral lag measured between 25-50keV and 100-300keV is 20 +/-
5ms, consistent with the small or negligible lags measured for short bursts.
The spectral and temporal properties of GRB 070707 are comparable to those of
the short hard bursts detected by other gamma-ray satellites, including BATSE
and Swift. We estimate a lower limit on the Lorentz factor Gamma >~ 25 for GRB
070707, assuming the typical redshift for short GRBs of z=0.35. This limit is
consistent with previous estimates for short GRBs and is smaller than the lower
limits of Gamma >~ 100 calculated for long GRBs. If GRB 070707 is a member of
the recently postulated class of short GRBs at z ~ 1, the lower limit on Gamma
increases to Gamma >~ 35.

provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the nature of the central engine
and the interaction between the relativistic flow and the environment of the
burst's progenitor. In this paper we show that there are exciting prospects of
detecting from the burst by MAGIC high-energy (HE) emission during the early
X-ray flaring activity and, later, during the normal afterglow phase. We also
identify the best observational strategy, trigger conditions and time period of
observation. We determine the expected HE emission from the flaring and
afterglow phases of GRBs in the context of the external shock scenario and
compare them with the MAGIC threshold. We find that an X-ray flare with the
average properties of the class can be detected in the 100 GeV range by MAGIC,
provided that z<0.7. The requested observational window with MAGIC should then
start from 10-20 s after the burst and cover about 1000-2000 s. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that there are solid prospects of detecting the late afterglow
emission in the same energy range for most of the bursts with z<0.5 if the
density of the external medium is n> a few cm^-3. In this case, the MAGIC
observation shall extend to about 10-20 ks. We provide recipes for tailoring
this prediction to the observational properties of each burst,in particular the
fluence in the prompt emission and the redshift, thus allowing an almost real
time decision procedure to decide whether to continue the follow-up observation
of a burst at late times.
