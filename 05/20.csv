with positive sign of the Einstein-Hilbert term. We demonstrate the presence of
a negative energy bulk mode that grows linearly in time. Unless there are
physical reasons to discard this mode, this theory is unstable. To address this
issue we prove that the mode is not pure gauge and that its negative energy is
time-independent and finite. The isometry generators L_0 and \bar{L}_0 have
non-unitary matrix representations like in logarithmic CFT. While the new mode
obeys boundary conditions that are slightly weaker than the ones by Brown and
Henneaux, its fall-off behavior is compatible with spacetime being
asymptotically AdS_3. We employ holographic renormalization to show that the
variational principle is well-defined. The corresponding Brown-York stress
tensor is finite, traceless and conserved. Finally we address possibilities to
eliminate the instability and prospects for chiral gravity.

stable under changes in external conditions and internal reaction parameters.
Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of
neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations.
Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is
most often 'sloppy': insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff'
combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace.
Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the
sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative non-adaptive
explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust
systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.

the problematic aspects of higher-spin interactions with $\Lambda=0$ but also
the strongly coupled nature of the derivative expansion of the fully nonlinear

noise of zero mean and variance $g$, presents particular spectral and
localization properties at low energy: a Dyson singularity in the integrated
density of states (IDoS) $N(E)\sim1/\ln^2E$ and a delocalization transition
related to the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length)
vanishing like $\gamma(E)\sim1/|\ln{}E|$ as $E\to0$. We study how this picture
is affected by breaking supersymmetry with a scalar random potential:
$H=H_{susy}+V(x)$ where $V(x)$ is a Gaussian white noise of variance $\sigma$.
In the limit $\sigma\ll{g}^3$, a fraction of states
$N(0)\sim{g}/\ln^2(g^3/\sigma)$ migrate to the negative spectrum and the
Lyapunov exponent reaches a finite value $\gamma(0)\sim{g}/\ln(g^3/\sigma)$ at
E=0. Exponential (Lifshits) tail of the IDoS for $E\to-\infty$ is studied in
detail and is shown to involve a competition between the two noises $\phi$ and
$V$ whatever the larger is. This analysis relies on analytic results for $N(E)$
and $\gamma(E)$ obtained by two different methods: a stochastic method and the
replica method. The problem of extreme value statistics of eigenvalues is also

and exothermic inelastic scattering from dark matter constituents; for
isotropic dark matter velocity distributions, the former decrease, while the
latter increase, the final flyby velocity. The fact that the observed flyby
velocity anomaly shows examples with both positive and negative signs, requires
the dominance of different dark matter scattering processes along different
flyby trajectories. The magnitude of the observed anomalies requires dark
matter densities many orders of magnitude greater than the galactic halo
density. Such a large density could result from an accumulation cascade, in
which the solar system-bound dark matter density is much higher than the
galactic halo density, and the earth-bound density is much higher than the
solar system-bound density. We discuss a number of strong constraints on the
hypothesis of a dark matter explanation for the flyby anomaly. These require
dark matter to be non-self-annihilating, with the dark matter scattering cross
section on nucleons much larger, and the dark matter mass much lighter, than

continuum emission from the highest redshift radio-loud quasar known to date,
the $z=6.12$ QSO J1427+3312. The VLA observations show an unresolved steep
spectrum source with a flux density of $250 \pm 20$ uJy at 8.4GHz and a
spectral index value of $\alpha^{8.4}_{1.4}=-1.1$. The 1.4 GHz VLBA images
reveal several continuum components with a total flux density of $1.778 \pm
0.109$ mJy, which is consistent with the flux density measured with the VLA at
1.4 GHz. Each of these components is resolved with sizes of a few
milliarcseconds, and intrinsic brightness temperatures on the order of $10^7$
to $10^8$ K. The physical characteristics as revealed in these observations
suggest that this QSO may be a Compact Symmetric Object, with the two dominant
components seen with the VLBA, which are separated by 31 mas (174 pc) and have
intrinsic sizes of ~22-34 pc, being the two radio lobes that are confined by
the dense ISM. If indeed a CSO, then the estimated kinematic age of this radio
AGN is only $10^3$ yr.

safety approach to quantum gravity. The central issue in this approach is the
search of a Fixed Point having suitable properties, and the tool that is used
is a type of Wilsonian renormalization group equation. We begin by discussing
various cutoff schemes, i.e. ways of implementing the Wilsonian cutoff
procedure. We compare the beta functions of the gravitational couplings
obtained with different schemes, studying first the contribution of matter
fields and then the so-called Einstein-Hilbert truncation, where only the
cosmological constant and Newton's constant are retained. In this context we
make connection with old results, in particular we reproduce the results of the
epsilon expansion and the perturbative one loop divergences. We then apply the
Renormalization Group to higher derivative gravity. In the case of a general
action quadratic in curvature we recover, within certain approximations, the
known asymptotic freedom of the four-derivative terms, while Newton's constant
and the cosmological constant have a nontrivial fixed point. In the case of
actions that are polynomials in the scalar curvature of degree up to eight we
find that the theory has a fixed point with three UV-attractive directions, so
that the requirement of having a continuum limit constrains the couplings to
lie in a three-dimensional subspace, whose equation is explicitly given. We
emphasize throughout the difference between scheme-dependent and
scheme-independent results, and provide several examples of the fact that only
dimensionless couplings can have ""universal"" behavior.

out by analyzing the structural properties of the citation network unfolded in
the recent decades by publishing works belonging to members of the two

between the IDP and DED groups, we focus on $two$ key quantities, namely, the
{\it degree of activity} of each group and the corresponding {\it degree of

former is provided by the {\it rate of production of publications} (RPP),

series obtained for the number of publications accumulated per year and by the
slope of a similar time series obtained for the corresponding citations. The
results indicate that in this case, the dynamics can be seen as geared by
triggered or damped competition. The network is a specific example of marked
heterogeneity in exchange of information activity in and between the
communities, particularly demonstrated through the nodes having a high

properties of low-mass stars in the two apparently very similar young (1-10
Myr) clusters sigma Ori and lambda Ori.
  Methods. We observed 98 and 49 low-mass (0.2-1.0 M_sun) stars in sigma Ori
and lambda Ori respectively, using the multi-object optical spectrograph FLAMES
at the VLT, with the high-resolution (R=17,000) HR15N grating (6470-6790 AA).
We used radial velocities, Li and Halpha to establish cluster membership and
Halpha and other optical emission lines to analyze the accretion properties of
members.
  Results. We identified 65 and 45 members of the sigma Ori and lambda Ori
clusters, respectively and discovered 16 new candidate binary systems. We also
measured rotational broadening for 20 stars and estimated the mass accretion
rates in 25 stars of the sigma Ori cluster, finding values between 10^-11 and
10^-7.7 M_sun yr^-1 and in 4 stars of the lambda Ori cluster, finding values
between 10^-11 and 10^-10.1 M_sun yr-1. Comparing our results with the infrared
photometry obtained by the Spitzer satellite, we find that the fraction of
stars with disks and the fraction of active disks is larger in the sigma Ori
cluster (52+-9% and 78+-16%) than in lambda Ori (28+-8% and 40+-20%)
  Conclusions. The different disk and accretion properties of the two clusters
could be due either to the effect of the high-mass stars and the supernova
explosion in the lambda Ori cluster or to different ages of the cluster
populations. Further observations are required to draw a definitive conclusion.

$\rho$ of traps $B$ that move sub-diffusively, such that the mean square
displacement of each trap grows as $t^{\gamma}$ with $0\leq \gamma \leq 1$.
Starting from a continuous time random walk (CTRW) description of the motion of
the particle and of the traps, we derive lower and upper bounds for $P(t)$ and
show that for $\gamma \leq 2/(d+2)$ these bounds coincide asymptotically, thus
determining asymptotically exact results. The asymptotic decay law in this
regime is exactly that obtained for immobile traps. This means that for
sufficiently subdiffusive traps, the moving $A$ particle sees the traps as
essentially immobile, and Lifshitz or trapping tails remain unchanged. For
$\gamma > 2/(d+2)$ and $d\leq 2$ the upper and lower bounds again coincide,
leading to a decay law equal to that of a stationary particle. Thus, in this
regime the moving traps see the particle as essentially immobile. For $d>2$,
however, the upper and lower bounds in this $\gamma$ regime no longer coincide
and the decay law for the survival probability of the $A$ particle remains
ambiguous.

the recent, more finely binned, Super-K atmospheric data. In the region
$L/E_\nu\gtrsim 10^4$ km/GeV, we have previously found that the sub-dominant

that $\theta_{13}$ is bounded from above by the atmospheric data while CHOOZ

a quadratic in $\theta_{13}$ term in ${\mathcal P}_{ee}$ and a linear term in
${\mathcal P}_{e\mu}$ and their contribution to $R_e$, a broad MSW resonance
for the solar mass-squared difference at 180 MeV, and an increase in
$\theta_{12}$ due to this resonant matter effect which alters the sign of the

corresponding to physical energy-momentum tensors of the nuclei completely stop
almost immediately after the collision in AdS_5, which, on the field theory
side, corresponds to complete nuclear stopping due to strong coupling effects,
likely leading to Landau hydrodynamics. Since in real-life heavy ion collisions
the large Bjorken x part of nuclear wave functions continues to move along the
light cone trajectories of the incoming nuclei leaving the small-x partons
behind, we conclude that a pure large coupling approach is not likely to
adequately model nuclear collisions. We show that to account for small-coupling
effects one can model the colliding nuclei by two (unphysical)
ultrarelativistic shock waves with zero net energy each (but with non-zero
energy density). We use this model to study the energy density of the
strongly-coupled matter created immediately after the collision. We argue that
expansion of the energy density in the powers of proper time squared
corresponds on the gravity side to a perturbative expansion of the metric in
graviton exchanges. Using such expansion we reproduce our earlier result that
the energy density of produced matter at mid-rapidity starts out as a constant
(of time) in heavy ion collisions at large coupling.

identification and characterisation of all the phases that a massive forming
YSO undergoes. It is of particular interest to verify the observability of the
phase in which the object is rapidly accreting while not yet igniting the
fusion of hydrogen that marks the arrival on the ZAMS. One of the candidate
prototypical objects for this phase is Mol160/IRAS23385+6053, which previous
studies suggest it could be in a pre-Hot Core stage. We further investigate
this issue by means of Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy in the 5-70 micron
range. The dense core of Mol160/IRAS23385+6053, which up to now had only been
detected at submm and mm wavelenghts has been revealed for the first time at 24
and 70 micron by Spitzer. The complete 24 micron -3.4 mm continuum cannot be
fitted with a standard model of a Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) star embedded
in an envelope. A simple greybody fit yields a mass of 220 solar masses. The
luminosity is slightly in excess of 3000 solar luminosities, which is a factor
of 5 less than previous estimates when only IRAS fluxes were available between
20 and 100 micron. The source is under-luminous by the same factor with respect
to UCHII regions or Hot-Cores of similar circumstellar mass, and simple models
show that this is compatible with an earlier evolutionary stage. Spectroscopy
between 5 and 40 microns revelas typical PDR/PIR conditions, where the required
UV illumination may be provided by other sources revealed at 24 microns in the
same region, and which can be plausibly modeled as moderately embedded
intermediate-mass ZAMS stars. Our results strengthen the suggestion that the
central core in Mol160/IRAS23385+6053 is a massive YSO actively accreting from
its circumstellar envelope and which did not yet begin hydrogen fusion.

Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. Generalizing the results of
[Adesso & Illuminati, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 150501 (2007)], we analyze whether
the entanglement shared by blocks of modes distributes according to a strong
monogamy law. This property, once established, allows to quantify genuine
N-partite entanglement in terms of the ""residual contangle"" not encoded into
2,...,K,...,(N-1)-partite quantum correlations. The explicit expression of this
entanglement measure is derived, by a recursive formula, for a subclass of
Gaussian states. These are fully symmetric (permutation-invariant) states
multi-partitioned into blocks, each consisting of an arbitrary number of modes.
We compute the genuine multipartite entanglement shared by the blocks
(""molecules"") and investigate its scaling properties with the number and size
of the molecules, the total number of modes, the global mixedness of the state,
and the squeezed resources. To achieve the exact computation we prove a general
result of symplectic analysis: Correlations among K molecules in N-mode
multi-symmetric Gaussian states can be transformed by a local unitary operation
into correlations shared by K single modes, one per molecule, in effective
non-symmetric states. Due to this theorem, the above results extend to the
subclass of non-symmetric Gaussian states that are obtained by unitarily
localizing the multipartite molecular entanglement of symmetric states. These
findings provide evidence that distributed Gaussian entanglement is strongly
monogamous even beyond specific symmetry constraints, and that the residual
contangle is a bona fide measure of genuine multipartite entanglement for
permutation-invariant Gaussian states under any multi-partition of the modes.

Insisting that all MSSM gauginos get masses at leading order and that the top
Yukawa coupling is of order the gauge coupling constant identifies the class of
viable models. These are models in which the SM fields live either in the bulk
or at the intersection of local sets of Type IIB D7-branes or their F-theory
relatives. General arguments allow us to compute the dependence of the Kahler

in the large moduli approximation. We illustrate this study in the case of
toroidal/orbifold orientifolds but discuss how the findings generalize to the
F-theory case which is more naturally compatible with coupling unification.
Only three types of 7-brane configurations are possible, leading each of them
to very constrained patterns of soft terms for the MSSM. We study their
consistency with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and other

corresponding to intersecting 7-branes is compatible with all present

The obtained MSSM spectrum is very characteristic and could be tested at LHC.

available down to the SDSS flux limit, the algorithm yields robust estimates
and errors for the centroid, position angle, ellipticity, exponential
half-light radius and number of member stars. This latter parameter is then
used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive
their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses, accounting for `CMD shot-noise'.
We find that faint systems are somewhat more elliptical than initially found
and ascribe that to the previous use of smoothed maps which can be dominated by
the smoothing kernel. As a result, the faintest half of the Milky Way dwarf
galaxies (M_V>-7.5) is significantly (4-sigma) flatter (e=0.47+/-0.03) than its
brightest half (M_V<-7.5, e=0.32+/-0.02). From our best models, we also
investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites, often
taken to be a sign of tidal distortion, can be quantified. We find that, except
for tentative evidence of distortion in CVnI and UMaII, these can be completely
accounted for by Poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems. We consider
three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint
satellites: rotation supported systems, stars following the shape of more
triaxial dark matter subhalos, or elongation due to tidal interaction with the
Milky Way. Although none of these is entirely satisfactory, the last one
appears the least problematic, but warrants much deeper observations to track
evidence of such tidal interaction.

the maximum-likelihood estimate can be too narrow, while confidence intervals
derived from the Bayesian approach are valid. We develop our statistical
approach for a flexible model where the luminosity function is modeled as a
mixture of Gaussian functions. Statistical inference is performed using Markov

the peak in the space density of quasars. The Bayesian method we develop has
the advantage that it is able to place accurate constraints on the luminosity

(AGNs), and was adopted as a criterion for their selection using data from
multi epoch surveys. Low Luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) are contaminated by the light
of their host galaxies, and cannot therefore be detected by the usual colour
techniques. For this reason, their evolution in cosmic time is poorly known.
Consistency with the evolution derived from X-ray detected samples has not been
clearly established so far, also because the low luminosity population consists
of a mixture of different object types. LLAGNs can be detected by the nuclear
optical variability of extended objects. Several variability surveys have been,
or are being, conducted for the detection of supernovae (SNe). We propose to
re-analyse these SNe data using a variability criterion optimised for AGN
detection, to select a new AGN sample and study its properties. We analysed
images acquired with the wide field imager at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope, in
the framework of the STRESS supernova survey. We selected the AXAF field

various optical data exist, originating in the EIS and COMBO-17 photometric
surveys and the spectroscopic database of GOODS. We obtained a catalogue of 132

compare our results with an HST variability study of X-ray and IR detected

simulations to critically assess two widely discussed models for high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations, global oscillation modes (diskoseismology) and
parametric resonance instabilities. We find that initially disturbed
hydrodynamic disks clearly display the trapped global g-mode oscillation
predicted by linear perturbation theory. In contrast, the sustained turbulence
produced in the simulated MHD disks by the magneto-rotational instability does
not excite these trapped g-modes. We cannot say at present whether the MHD
turbulence actively damps the hydrodynamic g-mode. Our simulated MHD disks also
fail to display any indications of a parametric resonance instability between
the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies. On the other hand, we do see
characteristic frequencies at any given radius in the disk corresponding to
local acoustic waves. We also conduct a blind search for any quasi-periodic

rate of the black hole, and place an upper limit of 2% on the total power in

extraordinarily broad [OIII]5007 and [OIII]4959 emission lines, with velocity
widths of approximately 2,000 k/ms. This result has significant implications
for the nature of this accreting black-hole system and the mass of the globular
cluster black hole. We show that the broad [OIII]5007 emission must arise from
material driven at high velocity from the black hole system. This is because
the volume available near the black hole is too small by many orders of
magnitude to have enough [OIII] emitting atoms to account for the observed
L([OIII]5007) at high velocities, even if this volume is filled with Oxygen at
the critical density for [OIII]5007. The Balmer emission is also weak,
indicating the observed [OIII] is not due to shocks. We therefore conclude that
the [OIII]4959,5007 is produced by photoionization of material driven across
the cluster. The only known way to drive significant material at high velocity
is for a system accreting mass near or above its Eddington limit, which
indicates a stellar mass black hole. Since it is dynamically implausible to
form an accreting stellar mass black hole system in a globular cluster with an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), it appears this massive globular cluster
does not have an IMBH. We discuss further tests of this conclusion, and its

of these stars through suitable proxies for their angular momentum and
eccentricity, and compare the observed distribution to the expectations from a
smooth distribution. On this basis we identify at least four ""phase space
overdensities"" of stars on very similar orbits in the Solar neighbourhood. We
estimate the statistical significance of these overdensities by Monte Carlo
simulations. Three of them have been identified previously: the Sirius and
Hercules moving group and a stream found independently in 2006 by Arifyanto and
Fuchs and Helmi et al. In addition, we have found a new stream candidate on a
quite radial orbit, suggesting an origin external to the Milky Way's disk.
Also, there is evidence for the Arcturus stream and the Hyades-Pleiades moving
group in the sample. This analysis, using only a minute fraction of the final
RAVE data set, shows the power of this experiment to probe the phase-space
substructure of stars around the Sun.

maximally-independent properties that have plausible correlations with
habitability, and that have been observed by, or can be derived from,
sufficiently large, currently available and representative stellar surveys. By
comparing solar values for the eleven properties, to the resultant stellar
distributions, we make the most comprehensive comparison of the Sun to other

Sun is more massive than 95 -/+ 2% of nearby stars and its orbit around the
Galaxy is less eccentric than 93 +/- 1% of FGK stars within 40 parsecs. Despite
these apparently atypical properties, a chi^2 -analysis of the Sun's values for
eleven properties, taken together, yields a solar chi^2 = 8.39 +/- 0.96. If a
star is chosen at random, the probability that it will have a lower value (be
more typical) than the Sun, with respect to the eleven properties analysed
here, is only 29 +/- 11%. These values quantify, and are consistent with, the
idea that the Sun is a typical star. If we have sampled all reasonable
properties associated with habitability, our result suggests that there are no
special requirements for a star to host a planet with life.

the confinement of the chain leads to creation of a charge density wave along
with the development of a potential difference across the center of cavity and
the surface. We show that the solvent entropy plays an important role in the
free energy of the confined system. For a given radius of the spherical cavity
and fixed charge density along the backbone of the chain, solvent and small ion
entropies dominate over all other contributions when chain lengths are small.
However, with the increase in chain length, chain conformational entropy and
polymer-solvent interaction energy also become important. Our calculations
reveal that energy due to electrostatic interactions plays a minor role in the
free energy. Furthermore, we show that the total free energy under spherical
confinement is not extensive in the number of monomers. Results for the osmotic
pressure and mean activity coefficient for monovalent salt are presented. We
demonstrate that fluctuations at one-loop level lower the free energy and

diffuse light metallicities ranging from Z_IHL < -2.5 for M_host ~ 10^11 M_sun,

increasing to Z_IHL ~ 0.1 for M_host ~ 10^15 M_sun. This behavior is coincident
with a narrowing of the intrahalo metallicity distribution as host mass
increases. The observable distinction in surface brightness between old,

of crucial importance when estimating the chemical abundance of an intrahalo

the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, has been detected, albeit at

statistical combination of results from multiple correlated galaxy data sets.

image onto the CMB; stacking regions aligned with superclusters produces a hot

effect to discrete structures. The ISW signal from supervoids and superclusters
can be combined with other cosmological probes to constrain dark energy and
cosmological parameters. In addition, our findings make it more plausible that
the extreme Cold Spot and other anomalies in the CMB are caused by supervoids.

quantum information theory. To this end, we investigate the question of
tripartite entanglement convertibility. We find that there exists no easy
criterion to determine whether a general tripartite transformation can be
performed with a nonzero success probability and in fact, the problem is
NP-hard. Our results are based on the connections between multipartite
entanglement and tensor rank (also called Schmidt rank), a key concept in
algebraic complexity theory. Not only does this relationship allow us to
characterize the general difficulty in determining possible entanglement
transformations, but it also enables us to observe the previously overlooked
fact that {\em the Schmidt rank is not an additive entanglement measure}. As a
result, we improve some best known transformation rates between specific
tripartite entangled states. In addition, we find obtaining the most efficient
algorithm for matrix multiplication to be precisely equivalent to determining
the optimal rate of conversion between the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state
and a triangular distribution of three Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states.

are related, in some manner, to classification schemes by means of symmetry
groups. In these schemes, irreducible representations of a Lie group have to be
decomposed according to some subgroup, thus providing a labeling of states in
terms of the subgroup. This is the typical situation in nuclear physics, where
Hamiltonians are described as functions of the Casimir operators of the groups
involved in some reduction chain. This further gives an effective method to
deduce the corresponding energy formulae. It is not however infrequent that the
embedding of a Lie group as subgroup of a larger symmetry group is not
canonical, hence leading to different branching rules of representations and to
an insufficient number of labeling operators.
  The objective of this work is to review the actual developments of the
contraction method, including also reduction chains with respect to abelian
(Cartan) subalgebras. The decomposition of the invariants of the coadjoint
representation provide natural classes of labeling operators for the
corresponding embeddings, which are of interest for various specific problems

then compared to results from thermodynamical considerations. In both cases,
the vacuum states of quantized scalar and spinor fields strengthen the

work that non-axisymmetric Rossby-Wave Instabilities (RWIs, Lovelace et al.

The development of RWIs results in non-axisymmetric density blobs, which exert
stronger torques onto the planet when they move to the vicinity of the planet.
Hence, large amplitude oscillations are introduced to the time behavior of the
total torque acted on the planet by the disk. In current simulations, RWIs do
not change the overall picture of inward orbital migration but cause a
non-monotonic behavior to the migration speed. As a side effect, RWIs also
introduce interesting structures into the disk. These structures may help the
formation of Earth-like planets in the Habitable Zone or Hot Earths interior to

by the presence of a close-by giant planet. Specifically, chromospheric hot
spots rotating in phase with the planet orbital motion have been observed
during some seasons in a few stars harbouring hot Jupiters. The spot leads the
subplanetary point by a typical amount of about 60-70 degrees, with the extreme
case of upsilon And where the angle is about 170 degrees. The interaction
between the star and the planet is described considering the reconnection
between the stellar coronal field and the magnetic field of the planet.
Reconnection events produce energetic particles that moving along magnetic
field lines impact onto the stellar chromosphere giving rise to a localized hot
spot. A simple magnetohydrostatic model is introduced to describe the coronal
magnetic field of the star connecting its surface to the orbiting planet. The
field is assumed to be axisymmetric around the rotation axis of the star and
its configuration is more general than a linear force-free field. With a
suitable choice of the free parameters, the model can explain the phase
differences between the hot spots and the planets observed in HD 179949,
upsilon And, HD 189733, and tau Bootis, as well as their visibility modulation
on the orbital period and seasonal time scales. The possible presence of cool
spots associated with the planets in tau Boo and HD 192263 cannot be explained
by the present model. However, we speculate about the possibility that
reconnection events in the corona may influence subphotospheric dynamo action
in those stars producing localized photospheric (and chromospheric) activity
migrating in phase with their planets.

Islands and are the most endangered species of marine mammal that lives
entirely within the jurisdiction of the United States. The species numbers
around 1300 and has been declining owing, among other things, to poor juvenile
survival which is evidently related to poor foraging success. Consequently,
data have been collected recently on the foraging habitats, movements, and
behaviors of monk seals throughout the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands.
Our work here is directed to exploring a data set located in a relatively
shallow offshore submerged bank (Penguin Bank) in our search of a model for a
seal's journey. The work ends by fitting a stochastic differential equation
(SDE) that mimics some aspects of the behavior of seals by working with
location data collected for one seal. The SDE is found by developing a time
varying potential function with two points of attraction. The times of location
are irregularly spaced and not close together geographically, leading to some
difficulties of interpretation. Synthetic plots generated using the model are
employed to assess its reasonableness spatially and temporally. One aspect is
that the animal stays mainly southwest of Molokai. The work led to the
estimation of the lengths and locations of the seal's foraging trips.

  Methods. High resolution optical (3300 -- 6800 Angstrom) spectra of SN2006X
at different phase obtained with UVES on the VLT were reduced and analysed.
  Results. In addition to previously detected atomic (NaI and CaII) and
molecular (CN) transitions we present detections of DIBs (6196, 6283 Angstrom),
diatomic molecules (CH, CH+) and neutral atoms (CaI) in the spectra of SN2006X
taken at different phases (at 2 days before and 14 and 61 days after the
brightness maximum). An analysis of the absorption profiles shows no variation
between phases in the abundance, nor the central velocities (within 3-sigma
error bars) of the (dense) gas tracers (CH, CH+ and CaI) and the DIBs. This is
consistent with the conclusion in the literature that SN2006X exploded behind a
dense interstellar cloud (inferred from strong atomic sodium and calcium lines
and CN transitions) which caused strong photometric reddening but whose
material was not directly affected by the supernova explosion. The CH and CN
column densities correspond to a reddening of one magnitude following the
Galactic correlation derived previously. The 6196 and 6283 lines detected in
the M100 ISM are under-abundant by factor of 2.5 to 3.5 (assuming a visual
extinction of ~2 mag) compared to the average Galactic ISM relationship. Upper
limits for 6379 and 6613 DIBs show that these are at least a factor of seven
weaker. Therefore, the Galactic DIB-reddening relation does not seem to hold in
M100, although the lower gas-to-dust ratio may further reduce this discrepancy.

model occasional chance successes. To define and quantify `chance success' is
knotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled
as random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or
any other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set
of predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that
the predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the
predictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.
Consider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs
anywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur
within 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule
to the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate
a set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are
exchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the
predictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We
generate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.
We consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and
(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The
$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully
predicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the
predictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --
which the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and
use a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed
seismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the
success rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described. If the
proffered predictions do no better than a simple scheme, they have little
value.

mechanisms connecting the resummation of perturbative series to nonperturbative
results, like the cancellation of nonperturbative ambiguities. Finally, we
argue that trans-series solutions are also relevant in the context of

theoretical insight into this phenomenon in the context of the particle filter.
We demonstrate that the maximum of the weights associated with the sample
ensemble converges to one as both the sample size and the system dimension
tends to infinity. Specifically, under fairly weak assumptions, if the ensemble
size grows sub-exponentially in the cube root of the system dimension, the
convergence holds for a single update step in state-space models with
independent and identically distributed kernels. Further, in an important
special case, more refined arguments show (and our simulations suggest) that
the convergence to unity occurs unless the ensemble grows super-exponentially
in the system dimension. The weight singularity is also established in models
with more general multivariate likelihoods, e.g. Gaussian and Cauchy. Although
presented in the context of atmospheric data assimilation for numerical weather
prediction, our results are generally valid for high-dimensional particle
filters.

faster than any polynomial rate. A consequence is that the flow admits strong

$dI/dV$ curves. We have found that the purely normal-state model reproduces all
the following experimental features: (a) the parabolic $V$-dependence of
$dI/dV$ in the high-$T$ region (above the conventional pseudogap temperature),
(b) the emergence and the nearly voltage-independent position of the ""humps""
from this parabolic behavior lowering the temperature, and (c) the crossing of
the absolute $dI/dV$ curves at a characteristic voltage $V^\times$. Our
findings indicate that conventional tunneling can be at the origin of most of
the uncommon features of the c axis transport in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. We have compared our calculations to
experimental data taken in severely underdoped and slightly underdoped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ small mesas. We have found good agreement
between the data and the calculations, without any shift of the calculated
dI/dV on the vertical scale. In particular, in the normal state (above
$T^\ast$) simple tunneling reproduces the experimental dI/dV quantitatively.
Below $T^\ast$ quantitative discrepancies are limited to a simple rescaling of
the voltage in the theoretical curves by a factor $\sim$2. The need for such
modifications remains an open question, that might be connected to a change of
the charge of a fraction of the carriers across the pseudogap opening.

feedback scheduling, this paper proposes an efficient feedback scheduling
scheme based on feedforward neural networks. Using the optimal solutions
obtained offline by mathematical optimization methods, a back-propagation (BP)
neural network is designed to adapt online the sampling periods of concurrent
control tasks with respect to changes in computing resource availability.
Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the
computational overhead significantly while delivering almost the same overall
control performance as compared to optimal feedback scheduling.

distance between EU countries is reflected in the correlated fluctuations of
the basic ME indicators: GDP, GDP/capita, Consumption and Investments. This

Moving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows to search for a
cluster-like structures derived both from the hierarchical organization of
countries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy. It is found
that the strongly correlated countries with respect to GDP fluctuations can be
partitioned into stable clusters. Some of the highly correlated countries, with
respect to GDP fluctuations, display strong correlations also in the Final
Consumption Expenditure, while others are strongly correlated in Gross Capital
Formation. On the other hand, one notices the similitude of the classifications
regarding GDP and Net Exports fluctuations as concerns the squared sum of the
correlation coefficients (so called country sensitivity). The final structure
proves to be robust against the constant size time window moving over the
scanned time interval. The policy implications of the above empirical results
concern the economic clusters arising in the presence of Marshallian

Imaging Spectrometer (XIS). The method is optimized for analyses of extended
sources with high photon statistics. Suzaku has four XIS detectors each with
its own X-ray CCD and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and has been providing unique
opportunities in spatially-resolved spectroscopic analyses of extended objects.
The detectors, however, suffer from broad and position-dependent PSFs with
their typical half-power density (HPD) of about 110''. In the authors' view,
this shortcoming has been preventing the high collecting area and high spectral
resolution of Suzaku to be fully exploited. The present method is intended to
recover spatial resolution to ~15'' over a dynamic range around 1:100 in the
brightness without assuming any source model. Our deconvolution proceeds in two
steps: An XIS image is multiplied with the inverse response matrix calculated
from its PSF after rebinning CCD pixels to larger-size tiles (typically 6''x
6''); The inverted image is then adaptively smoothed to obtain the final
deconvolved image. The PSF is modeled on a ray-tracing program and an observed
point-source image. The deconvolution method has been applied to images of
Centaurus A, PSR B1509-58 and RCW 89 taken by one XIS (XIS-1). The results have
been compared with images obtained with Chandra to conclude that the spatial
resolution has been recovered to ~20'' down to regions where surface brightness
is about 1:50 of the brightest tile in the image. We believe the spatial
resolution and the dynamic range can be improved in the future with higher
fidelity PSF modeling and higher precision pointing information.

collisionless shocks has broad implications for plasma astrophysics. It
directly impacts the interpretation of X-ray spectra from shocks, is important
for understanding how energy is partitioned between the thermal and cosmic ray
populations, and provides insight into the structure of the shock itself. In
Ghavamian, Laming & Rakowski (2007) we presented observational evidence for an
inverse square relation between the electron-to-proton temperature ratio and
the shock speed at the outer blast waves of supernova remnants in partially
neutral interstellar gas. There we outlined how lower hybrid waves generated in
the cosmic ray precursor could produce such a relationship by heating the
electrons to a common temperature independent of both shock speed and the
strength of the ambient magnetic field. Here we explore the mechanism of lower
hybrid wave heating of electrons in more detail. Specifically we examine the
growth rate of the lower hybrid waves for both the kinetic (resonant) and
reactive cases. We find that only the kinetic case exhibits a growing mode. At
low Alfv\'en Mach numbers (~15) the growth of lower hybrid waves can be faster
than the magnetic field amplification by modified Alfv\'en waves.

its reflection coefficient tunable through its level spacing and its coupling

particle spectra ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p and $\overline{p}$) with charged
particle multiplicity and event centrality is investigated in detail. Thermal
model fits to the measured particle ratios yield a chemical freeze-out
temperature $\sim$ 155 MeV in 200 GeV pp, 200 GeV dAu and 62.4 GeV Au-Au
collisions. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature is close to the
critical phase transition temperature predicted by lattice QCD calculations.
The kinetic freeze-out temperature extracted from hydrodynamically motivated
blast-wave models shows a continuous drop from pp, dAu and peripheral to
central Au-Au collisions, while the transverse flow velocity increases from
$\sim$ 0.2 in pp to $\sim$ 0.6 in central 200 GeV Au-Au collisions. The kinetic
freeze-out parameters in 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV Au-Au collisions seem to be
governed only by event multiplicity/centrality. In order to study the effect of
resonance decays on the kinetic freeze-out parameters, the data are fitted with
the blast-wave model including resonances. It is found that the thus extracted
parameters are consistent with those obtained without including resonances, the
resonance decays do not modify the spectral shapes significantly in the
measured $p_{T}$ region in STAR.

M. The mass-luminosity relation of W-R stars is shown to be most sensitive to
the mass loss rate during the helium burning phase \dot M_{3\alpha}. Together
with the mass-luminosity relation obtained for all evolutionary sequences
several more exact relations are determined for the constant ratio
f_{3\alpha}=\dot M/\dot M_{3\alpha} with 0.5 \le f_{3\alpha} \le 3.
Evolutionary models of W-R stars were used as initial conditions in
hydrodynamic computations of radial nonlinear stellar oscillations. The
oscillation amplitude is larger in W-R stars with smaller initial mass or with
lower mass loss rate due to higher surface abundances of carbon and oxygen. In
the evolving W-R star the oscillation amplitude decreases with decreasing
stellar mass M and for M < 10M_\odot the sufficiently small nonlinear effects
allow us to calculate the integral of the mechanical work W done over the
pulsation cycle in each mass zone of the hydrodynamical model. The only
positive maximum on the radial dependence of W is in the layers with
temperature of T\sim 2e5K where oscillations are excited by the iron Z--bump
kappa-mechanism. Radial oscillations of W-R stars with mass of M > 10M_\odot
are shown to be also excited by the kappa-mechanism but the instability driving
zone is at the bottom of the envelope and pulsation motions exist in the form
of nonlinear running waves propagating outward from the inner layers of the

corresponding boundary conditions in both cases. For the periodic boundary
condition used here, the equations of elasticity theory can be solved in a
consistent way with the technique of Ewald summation familiar from the
electrostatics of periodically replicated systems of charges and dipoles. Very
good agreement of the displacement fields calculated in this way with those
determined in particle simulations is observed for distances of more than about

measure the cross sections for beauty and heavy quarkonia production in
proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV to a reasonable
precision. Different experimental approaches employing single or di-muon
triggered events and b-tagging methods are discussed. The potential for
extracting the polarization of vector states from the decays J/psi to mu+ mu-
and Y to mu+ mu- is presented.

$J_{1}^{XXZ}$--$J_{2}^{XXZ}$ spin-1/2 anisotropic Heisenberg model on the
square lattice. In particular, the effects of the anisotropy $\Delta$ on the
$z$-aligned N\'{e}el and (collinear) stripe states, as well as on the
$xy$-planar-aligned N\'{e}el and collinear stripe states, are examined. All
four of these quasiclassical states are chosen in turn as model states on top
of which we systematically include the quantum correlations using a coupled
cluster method analysis carried out to very high orders. We find strong
evidence for two {\it quantum triple points} (QTP's) at ($\Delta ^{c} = -0.10
\pm 0.15, J_{2}^{c}/J_{1} = 0.505 \pm 0.015$) and ($\Delta ^{c} = 2.05 \pm
0.15, J_{2}^{c}/J_{1} = 0.530 \pm 0.015$), between which an intermediate
magnetically-disordered phase emerges to separate the quasiclassical N\'{e}el
and stripe collinear phases. Above the upper QTP ($\Delta \gtrsim 2.0$) we find
a direct first-order phase transition between the N\'{e}el and stripe phases,
exactly as for the classical case. The $z$-aligned and $xy$-planar-aligned
phases meet precisely at $\Delta = 1$, also as for the classical case. For all
values of the anisotropy parameter between those of the two QTP's there exists
a narrow range of values of $J_{2}/J_{1}$, $\alpha^{c_1}(\Delta)<J_{2}/J_{1}
<\alpha^{c_2}(\Delta)$, centered near the point of maximum classical
frustration, $J_{2}/J_{1} = {1/2}$, for which the intermediate phase exists.
This range is widest precisely at the isotropic point, $\Delta = 1$, where
$\alpha^{c_1}(1) = 0.44 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha^{c_2}(1) = 0.59 \pm 0.01$. The
two QTP's are characterized by values $\Delta = \Delta^{c}$ at which
$\alpha^{c_1}(\Delta^{c})=\alpha^{c_2}(\Delta^{c})$.
