Then, we show that covariance does not satisfy two postulates and hence, it
cannot be used as an indicator of genuine multipartite correlations. Finally,
we propose candidate for a measure of genuine multipartite correlations based

first rotational lines of the H2 molecule (28.2, 17.0, 12.3 and 9.7 micron)
over a wide field, and at high spectral resolution. H2EX can provide an
inventory of warm (> 100 K) molecular gas in a broad variety of objects,

atomic and ionic lines, as well as solid state features available in the 8 to

present the optical and mechanical design of the H2EX payload based on an
innovative Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (IFTS) fed by a 1.2m
telescope. The 20'x20' field of view is imaged on two 1024x1024 Si:As
detectors. The maximum resolution of 0.032 cm^-1 (FWHM) means a velocity
resolution of 10 km s^-1 for the 0-0 S(3) line at 9.7 micron. This instrument
offers the large field of view necessary to survey extended emission in the
Galaxy and local Universe galaxies as well as to perform unbiased extragalactic

uniquely suited to study the dynamics of H2 in all these environments. The

standard photon leads to photon-hidden photon oscillations that are searched
for in laboratory experiments like ALPS at DESY. Hidden photons produced in the

sufficiently large magnetic fields the artificial cilium is mainly governed by

superparamagnetic particles that are linked together by DNA strands. Attached
to a load particle, the resulting swimmer is actuated by an oscillating
external magnetic field so that it performs a non-reciprocal motion in order to
move forward. We model the superparamagnetic filament by a bead-spring
configuration that resists bending like a rigid rod and whose beads experience
friction with the surrounding fluid and hydrodynamic interactions with each
other. We show that, aside from finite-size effects, its dynamics is governed
by the dimensionless sperm number, the magnitude of the magnetic field, and the
angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction. Then we study the mean
velocity and the efficiency of the swimmer as a function of these parameters
and the size of the load particle. In particular, we clarify that the real
velocity of the swimmer is influenced by two main factors, namely the shape of
the beating filament (determined by the sperm number and the magnetic-field
strength) and the oscillation frequency. Furthermore, the load size influences
the performance of the swimmer and has to be chosen as a compromise between the
largest swimming velocity and the best efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that
the direction of the swimming velocity changes in a symmetry-breaking
transition when the angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction is
increased, in agreement with experiments.

the black holes are followed accurately within the simulation down to scales of
1 kpc; thereafter, we follow the merger analytically from the last dynamical

important black hole growth mechanisms: galaxy merger-driven gas accretion and
black hole coalescence. Using this, we find that SMBH at the center of Milky

Using wide-field UBV imaging, we photometrically select 44 WD candidates in

hydrogen-atmosphere DA WDs, one is a helium-atmosphere DB WD, and one is a cool
DC WD that exhibits no detectable absorption lines. We find an effective
temperature (T_eff) and surface gravity (log g) for each DA WD by fitting
Balmer-line profiles from model atmospheres to the observed spectra. WD
evolutionary models are then invoked to derive masses and cooling times for
each DA WD. Of the 17 DAs, five are at the approximate distance modulus of the
cluster. Another WD with a distance modulus 0.45 mag brighter than that of the
cluster could be a double-degenerate binary cluster member, but is more likely
to be a field WD. We place the five single cluster member WDs in the empirical
initial-final mass relation and find that three of them lie very close to the
previously derived linear relation; two have WD masses significantly below the
relation. These outliers may have experienced some sort of enhanced mass loss
or binary evolution; however, it is quite possible that these WDs are simply
interlopers from the field WD population. Eight of the 17 DA WDs show
significant CaII K absorption; comparison of the absorption strength with the
WD distances suggests that the absorption is interstellar, though this cannot
be confirmed with the current data.

mass loss mechanisms taking place in red giants. For M3 (NGC 5272), different
shapes for the HB mass distribution have been suggested, including Gaussian and
sharply bimodal alternatives. Here we study the mass distribution of HB stars
in M3 by comparing evolutionary tracks and photometric observations. Our
approach is thus of a semi-empirical nature, describing as it does the mass
distribution that is favored from the standpoint of canonical stellar
evolutionary predictions for the distribution of stars across the CMD. We
locate, for each individual HB star, the evolutionary track whose distance from
the star's observed color and magnitude is a minimum. Artificial tests reveal
that our method would be able to detect a bimodal mass distribution, if
present. We study the impact of different procedures for taking into account
the evolutionary speed, and conclude that they have but a small effect upon the
inferred mass distribution. We find that a Gaussian shape, though providing a
reasonable first approximation, fails to account for the detailed shape of M3's
HB mass distribution: the latter may have skewness and kurtosis that deviate
slightly from a perfectly Gaussian solution. Alternatively, the excess of stars
towards the wings of the distribution may also be accounted for in terms of a
bimodal distribution in which both the low- and the high-mass modes are normal,
the former being significantly wider than the latter. However, we also show
that the inferred distribution of evolutionary times is inconsistent with
theoretical expectations. This result is confirmed on the basis of three
independent sets of HB models, suggesting that the latter underestimate the
effects of evolution away from the zero-age HB. (abridged)

alternative to distributed space-time coding. One-way (where only the source
has data for destination) and two-way (where the destination also has data for

designed and proven to achieve maximum diversity gain by using a single antenna
path (using single antenna of the source, each relay stage and the destination)
with the maximum signal-to-noise ratio at the destination. For the half-duplex
case, two single antenna paths with the two best signal-to-noise ratios in
alternate time slots are used to overcome the rate loss with half-duplex nodes,
with a small diversity gain penalty. Finally to answer the question, whether to

coordinates are inside of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region, a dip in the
magnetosphere. This characteristic offers to the muon telescopes the lowest
rigidity of response to cosmic protons and ions ($\geq 0.4$ GV). The
magnetosphere's dip is responsible for several processes, such as the high
conductivity of the atmospheric layers due to the precipitation of energetic
particles in this region and an zonal electric field known as the pre-reversal
electric field (PRE) with an enhancement at evening hours. In addition the open
magnetosphere, propitiate the magnetic reconnections of the IMF lines that will
take place in this site in the day side. These factors are responsible for an
unusually large particle flux present in the SAA region, including particles
with energies above the pion production threshold. The main effect is an
increase of the muon intensity ($E_{\mu}>0.2GeV$) at ground, in the day side,
in up to ten times. We show that it is correlated with the pre-reversal

Einstein-Cartan gravity that preserves the full Lorentz group as the local

regarding the relation between gravity and a general gauge theory. The
dynamical variables are simply the frame field and the spin-connection
pulled-back to the hypersurface, thereby eliminating the need for simplicity
constraints on the momenta. A consequence of this is a degenerate
(pre)symplectic form, which appears to be a necessary feature of the
Einstein-Cartan formulation. A new feature unique to this approach arises when
the constraint algebra is computed: the algebra is a deformation of the de
Sitter, anti-de Sitter, or Poincar\'{e} algebra (depending on the value of the
cosmological constant) with the deformation parameter being the conformal Weyl
tensor.

  The general result is that double-minimum light curves arise when the

seen in the opposite limit; and for intermediate cases, single-minimum light
curves occur. These findings are interpreted with the aid of a simple,

witnesses (EWs) are introduced with the aim of detecting genuine tripartite
entanglement in the three-body reduced density matrix and discriminating
between the presence of the two types of genuine tripartite entanglement, W\B
and GHZ\W. By choosing appropriate EW operators, the problem of finding GHZ and
W EWs is reduced to linear programming. Specifically, we devise new W EWs based
on a spin-chain model with periodic boundary conditions, and we construct a
class of parametrized GHZ EWs by linearly combining projection operators
corresponding to all the different state-vector types arising for a
three-fermion system. A third class of EWs is provided by a GHZ stabilizer
operator capable of distinguishing W\B from GHZ\B entanglement, which is not
possible with $W$ EWs. Implementing these classes of EWs, it is found that all
states containing genuine tripartite entanglement are of W type, and hence
states containing GHZ\W genuine tripartite entanglement do not arise. Some
genuine tripartite entangled states that have a positive partial transpose
(PPT) with respect to some bipartition are detected. Finally, it is
demonstrated that a NIFG does not exhibit ""pure"" W\B genuine tripartite
entanglement: three-party entanglement without any separable or biseparable
admixture does not occur.

distribution in a superlattice of insulating La2CuO4 (LCO) and overdoped
La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO4 (LSCO). Despite its non-superconducting constituents, this

were found to be optimally doped, suggesting they are the main drivers of
superconductivity. Our results demonstrate the utility of RSXS for separating
electronic from structural effects at oxide interfaces.

thin-walled magnetic rings (outer diameter 150 nm, width 5 nm and thickness 5

are comparable to, or smaller than, the exchange length of the magnetic
material, then only two magnetic states are important - the pure single domain
state and the flux closure vortex state. The onion-shape magnetic state does
not arise. Theoretical calculations are based on an energetic analysis of pure
and slightly distorted single domain and flux closure vortex magnetic states.
Based on the analytical calculations, a phase diagram is also derived for
ultra-small ring structures exhibiting the region for vortex magnetic state
formations as a function of material parameter.

allows for large changes in fluid depth to cater for extreme inundations. The
key to the analysis underlying the approach is to choose surface and bed
boundary conditions that accommodate a constant turbulent shear as a nearly
neutral mode. Analysis supported by slow manifold theory then constructs a
model for the coupled dynamics of the fluid depth and the mean turbulent
lateral velocity. The model resolves the internal turbulent shear in the flow
and thus may be used in further work to rationally predict erosion and
transport in turbulent floods.

features due to very high expansion velocity, normally seen in hypernovae. The
photospheric velocity is higher than other normal Type Ic supernovae. It is
lower than SN 1998bw at $\sim$ 8 days after the explosion, but is comparable at
later epochs. The light curve evolution of SN 2007ru indicates a fast rise time
of 8$\pm$3 days to $B$ band maximum and post-maximum decline more rapid than
other broad-line Type Ic supernovae. With an absolute $V$ magnitude of -19.06,
SN 2007ru is comparable in brightness with SN 1998bw and lies at the brighter
end of the observed Type Ic supernovae. The ejected mass of \Nifs is estimated
to be $\sim0.4\Msun$. The fast rise and decline of the light curve and the high
expansion velocity suggest that SN 2007ru is an explosion with a high kinetic
energy/ejecta mass ratio ($E_{\rm K}/M_{\rm {ej}}$). This adds to the diversity
of Type Ic supernovae. Although the early phase spectra are most similar to
those of broad-line SN 2003jd, the [OI] line profile in the nebular spectrum of
SN 2007ru shows the singly-peaked profile, in contrast to the doubly-peaked
profile in SN 2003jd. The singly-peaked profile, together with the high
luminosity and the high expansion velocity, may suggest that SN 2007ru could be
an aspherical explosion viewed from the polar direction. Estimated oxygen
abundance 12 + log(O/H) of $\sim$8.8 indicates that SN 2007ru occurred in a

thermal component, supposedly at 10^6 K, attributed to the Local Bubble and
(iv) the very recently identified unabsorbed Solar Wind Charge-eXchange (SWCX)
emission from the heliosphere and the geocorona. We study the SWCX heliospheric
component and its contribution to observed data. In a first part, we apply a
SWCX heliospheric simulation to model the oxygen lines (3/4 keV) local
intensities during shadowing observations of the MBM12 molecular cloud and a
dense filament in the south galactic hemisphere with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and
Suzaku telescopes. In a second part, we present a preliminary comparison of
SWCX model results with ROSAT and Wisconsin surveys data in the 1/4 keV band.
We conclude that, in the 3/4 keV band, the total local intensity is entirely
heliospheric, while in the 1/4 keV band, the heliospheric component seems to
contribute significantly to the local SXRB intensity and has potentially a
strong influence on the interpretation of the ROSAT and Wisconsin surveys data
in terms of Local Bubble hot gas temperature.

We then construct some indicators to evaluate performances. The algorithm is

could be potentially very attractive for the purpose of building winning

from NGC 2273 and NGC 2985 show systematic variations in velocity dispersion
with azimuth, as one would expect if the shapes of their velocity ellipsoids
are significantly anisotropic, while the hotter disks in NGC 3898 and NGC 5533
appear to have fairly isotropic velocity dispersions. Correcting the rotational
motion for asymmetric drift using the derived velocity dispersions reproduces
the rotation curves inferred from emission lines reasonably well, implying that
this correction is quite robust, and that the use of the asymmetric drift
equation is valid. NGC 2985 is sufficiently close to face on for the data,
combined with the asymmetric drift equation, to determine all three components
of the velocity ellipsoid. The principal axes of this velocity ellipsoid are
found to be in the ratio sigma_z:sigma_phi:sigma_R ~ 0.7:0.7:1, which shows
unequivocally that this disk distribution function respects a third integral of
motion. The ratio is also consistent with the predictions of epicyclic theory,

due to neutrinos, a new source term for gravitational waves is shown to arise
from the neutrino anisotropic stress tensor. The importance of such a source
term, so far completely disregarded in the literature, is related to the high
velocity dispersion of neutrinos in the considered epoch; its computation
requires solving the full second-order Boltzmann equation for collisionless

of moderate extra mixing. The extra mixing affects the most luminous AGB stars

the C/O ratio, which has been fixed by the cumulative action of several third
dredge-up episodes. We find indications that the F abundance also increases

characterized by a density law in the equatorial plane of $\rho(R) \propto
R^{-3.5}$. The continuous radiation is calculated with the $\Lambda$ iteration
in the integral form, while we adopt a single-flight escape probability for
lines. We describe the non-LTE state, the radiation flow and conversion in the
disk. We conclude that the stellar Balmer continuum plays a key role in the
non-LTE state of the disk. The examination of the local energy gain and loss
suggests that the disk temperature has double minima along the equatorial plane
in the optically thick case: the intermediate region caused by deficient
ultraviolet radiation and the outer Lyman $\alpha$ cooling region. We have also
calculated some observable quantities, such as the spectral energy
distribution, the $UBV$ colors, the infrared excess and the Balmer line
profiles. Our calculations with the mass loss rate less than $10^{-10}
M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ reproduce the observed continuum quantities. However,
we could not get large H$\alpha$ emission strength observed in Be stars. We
suggest that the density gradient of the Be star disk is slower than that of

by discussing a general magnetic field with three components ($r, \phi, z$) in
advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). We also investigate the effects of
a global magnetic field on flows with convection. For these purposes, we first
adopt a simple form of the kinematic viscosity $\nu=\alpha
c_{s}^{2}/\Omega_{K}$ to study magnetized ADAFs. Then we consider a more
realistic model of the kinematic viscosity $\nu=\alpha c_{s}H$, which makes the
infall velocity increase but the sound speed and toroidal velocity decrease. We
next use two methods to study magnetized flows with convection, i.e., we take
the convective coefficient $\alpha_{c}$ as a free parameter to discuss the
effects of convection for simplicity. We establish the $\alpha_{c}-\alpha$
relation for magnetized flows using the mixing-length theory and compare this
relation with the non-magnetized case. If $\alpha_{c}$ is set as a free
parameter, then $|v_{r}|$ and $c_{s}$ increase for a large toroidal magnetic
field, while $|v_{r}|$ decreases but $|v_{\phi}|$ increases (or decreases) for
a strong and dominated radial (or vertical) magnetic field with increasing
$\alpha_{c}$. In addition, the magnetic field makes the $\alpha_{c}-\alpha$
relation be distinct from that of non-magnetized flows, and allows the
$\rho\propto r^{-1}$ or $\rho\propto r^{-2}$ structure for magnetized
non-accreting convection-dominated accretion flows with $\alpha+g\alpha_{c}< 0$

elliptical galaxies by using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board Spitzer.
We have significantly detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features
from 14 out of the 18 galaxies, and thus found that the presence of PAHs is not
rare but rather common in dusty elliptical galaxies. Most of these galaxies
show an unusually weak 7.7 um emission feature relative to 11.3 um and 17 um
emission features. A large fraction of the galaxies also exhibit H2 rotational
line and ionic fine-structure line emissions, which have no significant
correlation with the PAH emissions. The PAH features are well correlated with
the continuum at 35 um, whereas they are not correlated with the continuum at 6
um. We conclude that the PAH emission of the elliptical galaxies is mostly of
interstellar origin rather than of stellar origin, and that the unusual PAH
interband strength ratios are likely to be due to a large fraction of neutral
to ionized PAHs.

theory stimulated analysis of proposed computational, cryptographic and
teleportational schemes from the viewpoint of quantum foundations. It is
evident that not all mathematical calculations performed in complex Hilbert
space can be directly realized in physical space. Recently by analyzing the
original EPR paper we found that they argument was based on the misuse of the
von Neumann's projection postulate. Opposite to von Neumann, Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen (EPR) applied this postulate to observables represented by operators
with degenerate spectra. It was completely forbidden by von Neumann's
axiomatics of QM. It is impossible to repeat the EPR considerations in the von
Neumann's framework. In this note we analyze quantum teleportation by taking
into account von Neumann's projection postulate. Our analysis shows that so
called quantum teleportation is impossible in von Neumann's framework. On the
other hand, our analysis implies that the main quantum algorithms are totally
consistent with von Neumann's projection postulate.

We use density engineering on the healing length scale to produce such a pair

newly founded colony is a mixture multinomial distribution reflecting the
colonizing process. The environmental and demographic data are incorporated
into the model through a hierarchical prior structure. A simulation study is
conducted to investigate the performance of the model by using different levels
of population divergence and number of genetic markers included in the
analysis. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to conduct
inference for the posterior distributions of model parameters. We apply the

kinetic term, may provide a mechanism for the generation of thick branes, based
on the following observations. Firstly, K field theories allow for soliton
solutions with compact support, i.e., compactons. Compactons in 1+1 dimensions
may give rise to topological defects of the domain wall type and with finite
thickness in higher dimensions. Secondly, propagation of linear perturbations
is confined inside the compacton domain wall. Further, these linear
perturbations inside the topological defect are of the standard type, in spite
of the non-standard kinetic term. Thirdly, when gravity is taken into account,
location of gravity in the sense of Randall--Sundrum works for these compacton
domain walls provided that the backreaction of gravity does not destabilize the
compacton domain wall. It is the purpose of the present paper to investigate in
detail the existence and stability of compacton domain walls in the full K
field and gravity system, using both analytical and numerical methods. We find
that the existence of the domain wall in the full system requires a correlation
between the gravitational constant and the bulk cosmological constant, which is
thoroughly analyzed.

remedied by using local regression. The local regression approach relies on an

out to be very closely related to the characterisation of models admitting

the condition for the existence of viable inflationary trajectories is a

This condition depends on the ratio between the scale of inflation and the

and numerical methods. Approximate analytical descriptions of the problem
reveal that onset of thermal runaway instability is controlled by only two

continuous and extreme localization of the strain and temperature profiles in

Examples of time evolutions of the spatial distribution of the shear

angular degree, n the radial order, and, m the azimuthal order. This separation
--usually called rotational splitting (or just splitting)-- depends on the
rotation rate in the region sampled by the mode. In the same way, the precise
frequency of a mode depends on the physical properties of the cavity where the

described by seven oblique parameters at leading order in m_W^2/M_{1,2}^2. At
tree level we find that the only non-zero oblique parameters are Y =
-m_W^2/M_1^2 and W = -m_W^2/M_2^2, where the negative sign is due to the
presence of the negative norm states. The Lee-Wick operators do not violate the
SU(2)_L or custodial symmetry at tree level implying S=0 and T=0 respectively.
Our results differ substantially from a prior analysis in this respect. We show
a plot including all three constraints. The LEP1/SLC constraints are slightly
stronger than LEP2 and much stronger than the low energy ones. The LEP1/SLC
results exclude gauge boson masses of M_1 ~ M_2 ~ 3 TeV at the 99% confidence

large value. Loop corrections to the electroweak observables are suppressed by
the standard ~1/(4 \pi)^2 factor and are therefore not expected to change the
constraints on M_1 and M_2. This assertion is most transparent from the higher

and the effect of Si doping on it have been investigated by photoemission and
soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy. We have confirmed that Cr in GaN is
predominantly trivalent substituting for Ga, and that Cr 3$d$ states appear
within the band gap of GaN just above the N 2$p$-derived valence-band maximum.
As a result of Si doping, downward shifts of the core levels (except for Cr
2$p$) and the formation of new states near the Fermi level were observed, which
we attribute to the upward chemical potential shift and the formation of a
small amount of Cr$^{2+}$ species caused by the electron doping. Possibility of
Cr-rich cluster growth by Si doping are discussed based on the spectroscopic
and magnetization data.

computed within the SU(2) parity doublet model in mean field and in the
relativistic Hartree approximation. The mass of the chiral partner of the
nucleon is assumed to be 1200 MeV. The transition to the chiral restored phase
turns out to be a smooth crossover in all the cases considered, taking place at
a baryon density of just $2\rho_0$. The mass-radius relations of compact stars
are calculated to constrain the model parameters from the maximum mass limit of
neutron stars. It is demonstrated that chiral symmetry starts to be restored,
which in this model implies the appearance of the chiral partners of the
nucleons, in the center of neutron stars. However, the analysis of the decay
width of the assumed chiral partner of the nucleon poses limits on the validity
of the present version of the model to describe vacuum properties.

collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) calculations. These improved CIE
fractional abundances were calculated using state-of-the-art electron-ion
recombination data for K-shell, L-shell, Na-like, and Mg-like ions of all
elements from H through Zn and, additionally, Al- through Ar-like ions of Fe.
They also incorporate the latest recommended electron impact ionization data
for all ions of H through Zn. Improved CIE calculations based on these
recombination and ionization data are presented here. We have also developed a
new systematic method for determining the average emission measure ($EM$) and
electron temperature ($T_e$) of an isothermal plasma. With our new CIE data and
our new approach for determining average $EM$ and $T_e$, we have reanalyzed
SUMER observations of the solar corona. We have compared our results with those
of previous studies and found some significant differences for the derived $EM$
and $T_e$. We have also calculated the enhancement of coronal elemental
abundances compared to their photospheric abundances, using the SUMER
observations themselves to determine the abundance enhancement factor for each
of the emitting elements. Our observationally derived first ionization
potential (FIP) factors are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical model
of Laming (2008).

studied. We derived the equation for the motion of magnetization in the
presence of a spin current by using the local equilibrium assumption in
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We show that, in the resultant equation, the
ratio of the Gilbert damping constant, $\alpha$, and the coefficient, $\beta$,
of the current-induced torque, called non-adiabatic torque, depends on the
relaxation time of the fluctuating field $\tau_{c}$. The equality
$\alpha=\beta$ holds when $\tau_c$ is very short compared to the time scale of
magnetization dynamics. We apply our theory to current-induced magnetization
reversal in magnetic multilayers and show that the switching time is a
decreasing function of $\tau_{c}$.
