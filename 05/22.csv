significant systematic effect in deriving the dark energy equation of state w,
at level of a few percent. Here we illustrate how the peculiar velocity effect
in SN Ia data can be turned from a 'systematic' into a probe of cosmological
parameters. We assume a flat Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model (w=-1) and use low
and high redshift SN Ia data to derive simultaneously three distinct estimates
of the matter density Omega_m which appear in the problem: from the geometry,
from the dynamics and from the shape of the matter power spectrum. We find that
each of the three Omega_m's agree with the canonical value Omega_m=0.25 to
within 1 sigma, for reasonably assumed fluctuation amplitude and Hubble
parameter. This is consistent with the standard cosmological scenario for both
the geometry and the growth of structure. For fixed Omega_m = 0.25 for all
three Omega_m's, we constrain gamma = 0.72 +/- 0.21 in the growth factor
Omega_m(z)^gamma, so we cannot currently distinguish between standard Einstein
gravity and predictions from some modified gravity models. Future surveys of
thousands of SN Ia, or inclusion of peculiar velocity data, could significantly
improve the above tests.

major starburst that cannot last for long. We have identified galaxies which
may be BCDs during quiescence (QBCD), i.e., before the characteristic starburst
sets in or when it has faded away. These QBCD galaxies are assumed to be like
the BCD host galaxies. The SDSS/DR6 database provides ~21500 QBCD candidates.
We also select from SDSS/DR6 a complete sample of BCD galaxies to serve as
reference. The properties of these two galaxy sets have been computed and
compared. The QBCD candidates are thirty times more abundant than the BCDs,
with their luminosity functions being very similar except for the scaling
factor, and the expected luminosity dimming associated with the end of the
starburst. QBCDs are redder than BCDs, and they have larger HII region based
oxygen abundance. QBCDs also have lower surface brightness. The BCD candidates
turn out to be the QBCD candidates with the largest specific star formation
rate (actually, with the largest H_alpha equivalent width). One out of each
three dwarf galaxies in the local universe may be a QBCD. The properties of the
selected BCDs and QBCDs are consistent with a single sequence in galactic
evolution, with the quiescent phase lasting thirty times longer than the
starburst phase. The resulting time-averaged star formation rate is low enough
to allow this cadence of BCD -- QBCD phases during the Hubble time.

as applied to three disks with known dust gaps or inner holes out to 4-45 AU

$0.1-0.5$ AU. While one possible gap formation mechanism is dynamical clearing
by giant planets, other equally good explanations (stellar companions, grain
growth, photo-evaporation) exist. One way of distinguishing between different
scenarios is the presence and distribution of gas inside the dust gaps.
Keplerian disk models are fit to the spectro-astrometric position-velocity
curves to derive geometrical parameters of the molecular gas. We determine the
position angles and inclinations of the inner disks with accuracies as good as
1-2\degr, as well as the radial extent of the gas emission. Molecular gas is
detected well inside the dust gaps in all three disks. The gas emission extends
to within a radius of 0.5 AU for HD 135344B and to 0.1 AU for TW Hya,
supporting partial clearing by a $< 1-10 M_{\rm Jup}$ planetary body as the
cause of the observed dust gaps, or removal of the dust by extensive grain
coagulation and planetesimal formation. The molecular gas emission in SR 21
appears to be truncated within $\sim 7 $AU, which may be caused by complete
dynamical clearing by a more massive companion. We find a smaller inclination
angle of the inner disk of TW Hya than that determined for the outer disk,
suggestive of a disk warp. We also detect significant azimuthal asymmetries in

in general sensitive to the interaction strength between fermions, the
magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields, and to the angular
momentum projection of the order parameter. In particular, due to the
anisotropic nature of p-wave interactions we show that the time-of-flight
expansion of a p-wave superfluid is anisotropic even if the superfluid is
confined to a completely isotropic trap, unlike the case of Bose or s-wave
Fermi condensates, which under the same circumstances expand isotropically.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that expanding p-wave superfluids released from
axially symmetric traps experience anisotropy inversions, where the aspect
ratio between the axial and radial directions change during expansion, while
the axial symmetry can also be lost reflecting the spatial anisotropy of the
underlying interaction.

first main result, using the abstract framework established by the authors in
the companion work \cite{GMWZ6}, is to show that existence and stability of
arbitrary amplitude exact boundary-layer solutions follow from a uniform
spectral stability condition on layer profiles that is expressible in terms of
an Evans function (uniform Evans stability). Whenever this condition holds we
give a rigorous description of the small viscosity limit as the solution of a
hyperbolic problem with ""residual"" boundary conditions. Our second is to show
that uniform Evans stability for small-amplitude layers is equivalent to Evans
stability of the limiting constant layer, which in turn can be checked by a
linear-algebraic computation. Finally, for a class of symmetric-dissipative
systems including the physical examples mentioned above, we carry out energy
estimates showing that constant (and thus small-amplitude) layers always
satisfy uniform Evans stability. This yields existence of small-amplitude
multi-dimensional boundary layers for the compressible Navier-Stokes and MHD
equations. For both equations these appear to be the first such results in the

concept of homogeneity of the standard relativistic cosmology considering its
various definitions of distance. We study the physical consequences of the
distinction between the usual concept of spatial homogeneity (SH), as defined
by the Cosmological Principle, and the concept of observational homogeneity
(OH), arguing that OH is in principle falsifiable by means of astronomical
observations, whereas verifying SH is only possible indirectly. Simulated
counts of cosmological sources are produced by means of a generalized
number-distance expression that can be specialized to produce either the counts
of the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, which has SH by construction, or
other types of counts, which do, or do not, have OH by construction.
Expressions for observational volumes and differential densities are derived
with the various cosmological distance definitions in the EdS model. Simulated
counts that have OH by construction do not always exhibit SH features. The
reverse situation is also true. Besides, simulated counts with no OH features
at low redshift start showing OH characteristics at high redshift. The comoving
distance seems to be the only distance definition where both SH and OH appear
simultaneously. The results show that observations indicating possible lack of
OH do not necessarily falsify the standard Friedmannian cosmology, meaning that
this cosmology will not necessarily always produce observable homogeneous
densities. The general conclusion is that the use of different cosmological
distances in the characterization of the galaxy distribution lead to
significant ambiguities in reaching conclusions about the behavior of the
large-scale galaxy distribution in the Universe.

relies on accurate theoretical models of the binary dynamics. We cast the
equations describing binary inspiral in the extreme mass ratio limit in terms
of action angle variables, and derive properties of general solutions using a
two-timescale expansion. This provides a rigorous derivation of the
prescription for computing the leading order orbital motion. As shown by Mino,
this leading order or adiabatic motion requires only knowledge of the
orbit-averaged, dissipative piece of the self force. The two timescale method
also gives a framework for calculating the post-adiabatic corrections. For
circular and for equatorial orbits, the leading order corrections are
suppressed by one power of the mass ratio, and give rise to phase errors of
order unity over a complete inspiral through the relativistic regime. These
post-1-adiabatic corrections are generated by the fluctuating piece of the
dissipative, first order self force, by the conservative piece of the first
order self force, and by the orbit-averaged, dissipative piece of the second
order self force. We also sketch a two-timescale expansion of the Einstein
equation, and deduce an analytic formula for the leading order, adiabatic
gravitational waveforms generated by an inspiral.

lexicographic, Gray-code, and block-wise sorting. We found that a lexicographic
sort improves compression--sometimes generating indexes twice as small--and
make indexes several times faster. While sorting takes time, this is partially
offset by the fact that it is faster to index a sorted table. Column order is
significant: it is generally preferable to put the columns having more distinct
values at the beginning. A block-wise sort is much less efficient than a full
sort. Moreover, we found that Gray-code sorting is not better than

by Suzaku (Tamagawa et al. 2008) to derive a metallicity of log(Z) = -1.32
(+0.67,-0.33) for the progenitor of this supernova, which corresponds to
log(Z/Zsun)= 0.60 (+0.31,-0.60) according to the latest determination of the
solar metallicity by Asplund et al. (2005). The uncertainty in the measurement
is large, but metallicities much smaller than the solar value can be
confidently discarded. We discuss the implications of this result for future
research on Type Ia supernova progenitors.

by the neutrino mechanism. We find that a
critical-luminosity/mass-accretion-rate condition distinguishes non-exploding
from exploding models in hydrodynamic one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
(2D) simulations. We present 95 such simulations that parametrically explore
the dependence on neutrino luminosity, mass accretion rate, resolution, and
dimensionality. While radial oscillations mediate the transition between 1D
accretion (non-exploding) and exploding simulations, the non-radial standing
accretion shock instability characterizes 2D simulations. We find that it is
useful to compare the average dwell time of matter in the gain region with the
corresponding heating timescale, but that tracking the residence time
distribution function of tracer particles better describes the complex flows in
multi-dimensional simulations. Integral quantities such as the net heating
rate, heating efficiency, and mass in the gain region decrease with time in
non-exploding models, but for 2D exploding models, increase before, during, and
after explosion. At the onset of explosion in 2D, the heating efficiency is
$\sim$2% to $\sim$5% and the mass in the gain region is $\sim$0.005 M$_{\sun}$
to $\sim$0.01 M$_{\sun}$. Importantly, we find that the critical luminosity for
explosions in 2D is $\sim$70% of the critical luminosity required in 1D. This
result is not sensitive to resolution or whether the 2D computational domain is
a quadrant or the full 180$^{\circ}$. We suggest that the relaxation of the
explosion condition in going from 1D to 2D (and to, perhaps, 3D) is of a
general character and is not limited by the parametric nature of this study.

halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and
how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy
stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of
galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e.
more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. Halos
at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated
from N-body simulations. The halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs in
conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection
between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of
merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer
the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo
mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar
mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate --
stellar mass relation to z~1. The data demands, for example, that the star
formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with Mstar~10^{10.0-10.5} Msun
from 0<z<1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with
M~10^{11.5-12.5} Msun. The star formation rate -- halo mass relation is
approximately Gaussian over the range 0<z<1 with a mildly evolving mean and
normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues,
including 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharp
characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) the
dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxies
with Mstar<10^11 Msun at z<1.

the measurements and precision of relative astrometry. Specifically, we address
the problem of measuring the separations of close pairs of binary stars with
adaptive optics in the J and K bands. We investigate the influence of weather
conditions, zenithal distance, star's spectral type and observing wavelength on
the astrometric precision and determine the accuracy of these parameters that
is necessary to detect exoplanets with existing and planned large ground based
telescopes with adaptive optics facilities.
  The analytical formulae for simple monochromatic refraction and a full
approach, as well as moderately simplified procedure, are used to compute
refraction corrections under a variety of observing conditions. It is shown
that the atmospheric refraction must be taken into account in astrometric
studies but the full procedure is not neccessary in many cases. Requirements
for achieving a certain astrometric precision are specified.

detect M_HI = 1.8 x 10^9 M_sun of HI emission-line gas that is distributed in a
140 kpc wide disc-like structure along the optical disc and dust-lane of NGC
612. The bulk of the gas in the disc appears to be settled in regular rotation
with a total velocity range of 850 km/s, although asymmetries in this disc
indicate that perturbations are being exerted on part of the gas, possibly by a
number of nearby companions. The HI disc in NGC 612 suggests that the total
mass enclosed by the system is M_enc ~ 2.9 x 10^12 sin^-2(i) M_sun, implying
that this early-type galaxy contains a massive dark matter halo. We also
discuss an earlier study by Holt et al. that revealed the presence of a
prominent young stellar population at various locations throughout the disc of
NGC 612, indicating that this is a rare example of an extended radio source
that is hosted by a galaxy with a large-scale star-forming disc. In addition,
we map a faint HI bridge along a distance of 400 kpc in between NGC 612 and the
gas-rich (M_HI = 8.9 x 10^9 M_sun) barred galaxy NGC 619, indicating that
likely an interaction between both systems occurred. From the unusual amounts
of HI gas and young stars in this early-type galaxy, in combination with the
detection of a faint optical shell and the system's high infra-red luminosity,
we argue that either ongoing or past galaxy interactions or a major merger
event are a likely mechanism for the triggering of the radio source in NGC 612.

cosmological origin or not should be answerable in no uncertain terms because
both the spectrum characteristics and the count distribution law arising from
the two distinct settings are completely different. If the redshift of GRB is
generated by gravity, then the afterglow spectrum will certainly contain both
the gravitational redshits (containing emission and absorption feature) and
Doppler absorption redshift, and hold a definite relation between the two
redshifts. In this paper, we present nine direct and decisive evidences to show
that the gamma-ray burst redshift is indeed generated by gravity of neutron
stars in their merging process; in which, 114 GRBs' redshifts showed that the
statistical count distribution law for the two kinds redshift is the same (with

to have a building block that produces a considerable amount of entanglement

consider permanently-coupled spin networks and study entanglement generation
between qubit pairs to find low-complexity structures capable of generating
considerable entanglement between various qubit pairs. We find that in axially
symmetric networks the generated entanglement between some qubit pairs is
rather larger than generic networks. We show that in uniformly-coupled spin
rings each pair can be considerably entangled through controlling suitable
vertices. To set the location of controlling-vertices, we observe that the
symmetry has to be broken for a definite time. To achieve this, a magnetic flux
can be applied to break symmetry via Aharonov-Bohm effect. Such a set up can
serve as an efficient entanglement distributor bus in which each vertex-pair
can be efficiently entangled through exciting only one fixed vertex and
controlling the evolution time. The low-complexity of this scheme makes it
attractive for use in nanoscale quantum information processors.

Galaxy. These provide a measure of the amount of enrichment by high-mass versus
intermediate-mass stars. Such ratios, derived from the C18O and C17O J=1-0
lines alone, may be affected by systematic errors. Therefore, the C18O and C17O
(1-0), (2-1), and (3-2), as well as the 13CO (1-0) and (2-1) lines, were
observed towards 18 prominent galactic targets (a total of 25 positions). The
combined dataset was analysed with an LVG model, accounting for optical depth
effects. The data cover galactocentric radii R between 0.1 and 16.9 kpc (solar
circle at 8.5 kpc). Near the centre of the Galaxy, 18O/17O = 2.88 +/- 0.11. For
the galactic disc out to an R of ca. 10 kpc, 18O/17O = 4.16 +/- 0.09. At ca. R
= 16.5 kpc, 18O/17O = 5.03 +/- 0.46. Assuming that 18O is synthesised
predominantly in high-mass stars (M > 8 Msun), while C17O is mainly a product
of lower-mass stars, the ratio from the inner Galaxy indicates a dominance of
CNO-hydrogen burning products that is also apparent in the C- and N-isotope
ratios. The high 18O/17O value of the solar system (5.5) relative to that of
the ambient ISM suggests contamination by nearby high-mass stars during its
formation. High values in the metal-poor environment of the outer Galaxy are
not matched by the low values observed towards the even more metal-poor LMC.
Apparently, the outer Galaxy cannot be considered as an intermediate
environment between the solar neighbourhood and the ISM of small metal-poor
galaxies. The apparent 18O/17O gradient along the galactic disc and the
discrepancy between outer disc and LMC isotope ratios may be explained by
different ages of the respective stellar populations.

is a widely established approach to study the ability of traffic models to
describe emergent traffic jams. Besides deriving a collection of useful
formulas for stability analyses, the main attention is put on the
characteristic speeds, which are related to the group velocities of the
linearized model equations. Most macroscopic traffic models with a dynamic
velocity equation appear to predict two characteristic speeds, one of which is
faster than the average velocity. This has been claimed to constitute a
theoretical inconsistency. We will carefully discuss arguments for and against
this view. In particular, we will shed some new light on the problem by
comparing Payne's macroscopic traffic model with the Aw-Rascle model and
macroscopic with microscopic traffic models.

specifically with the X-rays, to search for possible connections between the
emission at different energies. 3C 273 shows variability at all frequencies,
with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being the
signatures of the different emission mechanisms. The variability properties of
the X-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly a
Seyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timing
properties to account for the X-ray emission below and above ~20 keV. The
dominant hard X-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons accelerated
by the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with the
flaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescale
variations in the optical. This optical component is consistent with being
optically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hard
X-rays would be produced through inverse Compton processes (SSC and/or EC) by
the same electron population. We show evidence that this synchrotron component
extends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended by
emission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-year

continuum sky suitable for aiding the design of next generation radio
interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The emphasis is on
modelling the large-scale cosmological distribution of radio sources rather
than the internal details of individual galaxies. Here we provide a description
of the simulation to accompany the online release of a catalogue of 320 million
simulated radio sources. The simulation covers 20x20 deg^2 - a plausible upper
limit to the instantaneous field of view attainable with future (e.g. SKA)
aperture array technologies - out to redshift z=20, and down to flux density
limits of 10 nJy at 151, 610 MHz, 1.4, 4.86 and 18 GHz. Five distinct source
types are included: radio-quiet AGN, radio-loud AGN of the FRI and FRII
structural classes, and star-forming galaxies, the latter split into
populations of quiescent and starbursting galaxies.
  In our semi-empirical approach, the simulated sources are drawn from observed
(or extrapolated) luminosity functions and grafted onto an underlying dark
matter density field with biases which reflect their measured large-scale
clustering. A numerical Press-Schechter-style filtering of the density field is
used to identify and populate clusters of galaxies. Radio source structures are
built from point source and elliptical sub-components, and for FRI and FRII
sources an orientation-based unification and beaming model is used to partition
flux between the core and extended lobes and hotspots. The simulation output
can be post-processed to achieve more complete agreement with observational
data in the years ahead, with the aim of using these 'idealised skies' in
telescope simulators to optimise the design of the SKA itself (abridged).

between exploring the environment to find profitable actions and exploiting
what is already known. In the stationary case, the distributions of the rewards
do not change in time, Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) policies have been shown to
be rate optimal. A challenging variant of the MABP is the non-stationary bandit
problem where the gambler must decide which arm to play while facing the
possibility of a changing environment. In this paper, we consider the situation
where the distributions of rewards remain constant over epochs and change at
unknown time instants. We analyze two algorithms: the discounted UCB and the
sliding-window UCB. We establish for these two algorithms an upper-bound for
the expected regret by upper-bounding the expectation of the number of times a
suboptimal arm is played. For that purpose, we derive a Hoeffding type
inequality for self normalized deviations with a random number of summands. We
establish a lower-bound for the regret in presence of abrupt changes in the
arms reward distributions. We show that the discounted UCB and the
sliding-window UCB both match the lower-bound up to a logarithmic factor.

linear instability, the wavelength of the former scaling on the grain size,
that of the latter being controled by the water depth. We revisit here this
problem, using the computation of the turbulent flow over a wavy bottom
performed in Part 1. The details of the different mechanisms controlling
sediment transport are encoded into three quantities: the saturated flux, the
saturation length and the threshold shear stress. Theses quantities are
modelled in the case of erosion and momentum limited bed loads. This framework
allows to give a clear picture of the instability in terms of dynamical
mechanisms. The relation between the wavelength at which ripples form and the
flux saturation length is quantitatively derived. Inverting the problem,
experimental data is used to determine the saturation length as a function of
grain size and shear velocity. Finally, using the systematic expansion of the
flow field with respect to the corrugation amplitude, we discuss the non-linear
selection of ripple aspect ratio. Investingating the effect of a free surface
on the linear instability, we show that the excitation of standing waves at the
surface has a stabilising effect, independently of the details of the flow and
sediment transport models. Consequently, the shape of the dispersion relation
is such that dunes can not result from a primary linear instability. We present
the results of field experiments performed in the natural sandy Leyre river,
which evidence the formation of ripples by a linear instability and the
formation of dunes by a non-linear pattern coarsening limited by the free
surface. We show that mega-dunes form when the sand bed presents
heterogeneities such as a wide distribution of grain sizes.

curved spacetime, the theory must be formulated in a local and covariant manner
in terms of locally measureable field observables. Since a generic curved
spacetime does not possess symmetries or a unique notion of a vacuum state, the
theory also must be formulated in a manner that does not require symmetries or
a preferred notion of a ``vacuum state'' and ``particles''. We propose such a
formulation of quantum field theory, wherein the operator product expansion
(OPE) of the quantum fields is elevated to a fundamental status, and the
quantum field theory is viewed as being defined by its OPE. Since the OPE
coefficients may be better behaved than any quantities having to do with
states, we suggest that it may be possible to perturbatively construct the OPE
coefficients--and, thus, the quantum field theory. By contrast, ground/vacuum
states--in spacetimes, such as Minkowski spacetime, where they may be
defined--cannot vary analytically with the parameters of the theory. We argue
that this implies that composite fields may acquire nonvanishing vacuum state
expectation values due to nonperturbative effects. We speculate that this could
account for the existence of a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the
stress-energy tensor of a quantum field occurring at a scale much smaller than
the natural scales of the theory.

visualizes the emergence of successively larger scale fluctuations to result
from the space-time integration of enclosed smaller scale fluctuations. The
model predicts a universal inverse power law incorporating the golden mean for
fractal fluctuations and for the corresponding power spectra, i.e., the

Fractal fluctuations therefore exhibit quantum-like chaos. The model predicted

the temperature power-law of the conductance. Even more importantly, we
demonstrate that multiple-quasiparticles tunneling at low energies becomes the
most relevant process. This result will be used to explain the experimental

  We use the rotation measures (RMs) of low-latitude Galactic pulsars and
combine them with their dispersion measures and estimated distances to map out
the line-of-sight component of the interstellar magnetic field in the near half
of the Galactic disk. We then fit our map of the line-of-sight field to the

than the others. From this we conclude that the large-scale interstellar

blue-cloud galaxies, and their relation to the dark matter distribution in the
COMBO-17 survey as function of scale down to z~1. We measure the 2nd-order
auto- and cross-correlation functions of galaxy clustering and express the
relative biasing by using aperture statistics. Also estimated is the relation
between the galaxies and the dark matter distribution exploiting galaxy-galaxy
lensing (GGL). All observables are further interpreted in terms of a halo
model. To fully explain the galaxy clustering cross-correlation function with a
halo model, we need to introduce a new parameter,R, that describes the
statistical relation between numbers of red and blue galaxies within the same
halo. We find that red and blue galaxies are clearly differently clustered, a
significant evolution of the relative clustering with redshift was not found.
There is evidence for a scale-dependence of relative biasing. The relative
clustering, the GGL and, with some tension, the galaxy numbers can be explained
consistently within a halo model. For the cross-correlation function one
requires a HOD variance that becomes Poisson even for relatively small
occupancy numbers. For our sample, this rules out with high confidence a
""Poisson satellite"" scenario as found in semi-analytical models. Red galaxies
have to be concentrated towards the halo centre, either by a central red galaxy
or by a concentration parameter above that for dark matter.The value of R
depends on the presence or absence of central galaxies: If no central galaxies
or only red central galaxies are allowed, R is consistent with zero, whereas a
positive correlation $R=+0.5\pm0.2$ is needed if both blue and red galaxies can
have central galaxies.[ABRIDGED]

distribution. We report arcsecond resolution observations of dust and CO line
emissions with the IRAM array. The disk properties are derived using a standard
disk model. We use the Meudon PDR code to study the chemistry. The two disks
share some common properties. The mean CO abundance is low despite disk
temperatures above the CO condensation temperature. Furthermore, the CO surface
density and dust opacity have different radial dependence. The CQ Tau disk
appears warmer, and perhaps less dense than that of MWC 758. Modeling the
chemistry, we find that photodissociation of CO is a viable mechanism to
explain the low abundance. The photospheric flux is not sufficient for this: a
strong UV excess is required. In CQ Tau, the high temperature is consistent
with expectation for a PDR. The PDR model has difficulty explaining the mild
temperatures obtained in MWC 758, for which a low gas-to-dust ratio is
preferred. A yet unexplored alternative could be that, despite currently high
gas temperatures, CO remains trapped in grains, as the models suggest that
large grains can be cold enough to prevent thermal desorption of CO. The low
inclination of the CQ Tau disk, ~30^\circ, challenges previous interpretations
given for the UX Ori - like luminosity variations of this star. We conclude
that CO cannot be used as a simple tracer of gas-to-dust ratio, the CO
abundance being affected by photodissociation, and grain growth.

maps are locally linearizable (i.e., become a rotation under an appropriate
change of coordinates which is analytic in a neighborhood of the origin). The
dynamical behavior of the iterates of the map on the boundary of the Siegel
disk exhibits strong scaling properties which have been intensively studied in
the physical and mathematical literature.
  In the cases we study, the boundary of the Siegel disk is a Jordan curve
containing a critical point of the map (we consider critical maps of different
orders), and there exists a natural parameterization which transforms the
dynamics on the boundary into a rotation. We compute numerically this
parameterization and use methods of harmonic analysis to compute the global
Holder regularity of the parameterization for different maps and rotation
numbers.
  We obtain that the regularity of the boundaries and the scaling exponents are
universal numbers in the sense of renormalization theory (i.e., they do not
depend on the map when the map ranges in an open set), and only depend on the
order of the critical point of the map in the boundary of the Siegel disk and
the tail of the continued function expansion of the rotation number. We also
discuss some possible relations between the regularity of the parameterization
of the boundaries and the corresponding scaling exponents.

exchange between objects in the Pluto system. We find that ejecta velocities
from KB impacts are too low to escape from Pluto and Charon. However, ejecta
can escape Nix and Hydra, and is capable of covering one another to depths as
high as 10s of meters, and Charon and Pluto, perhaps to depths up to several
10s of cm. Although Pluto's annual atmospheric frost deposition cycle will
cover such imported debris on timescales faster than it is emplaced, no such
masking mechanism is available on Hydra, Nix, and Charon. As a result, ejecta
exchange between these bodies is expected to evolve their colors, albedos, and
other photometric properties to be similar. We examined the ability of ejecta
exchange to work for other Kuiper Belt binaries and found the process can be
effective in many cases. This process may also operate in asteroid binary
systems.

dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Quantum dots that couple to the
photonic crystal waveguide are found to decay up to 27 times faster than
uncoupled quantum dots. From these measurements $\beta$-factors of up to 0.89
are derived, and an unprecedented large bandwidth of 20 nm is demonstrated.
This shows the promising potential of photonic crystal waveguides for efficient
single-photon sources. The scaled frequency where the enhancement is observed
is in excellent agreement with theory taking into account that the light-matter
coupling is strongly enhanced due to the significant slow-down of light in the
photonic crystal waveguide.

group as it was proposed in a recent model, they can acquire electroweak scale
masses and are thus accessible experimentally in the near future. When this
idea is combined with quark-lepton unification \`{a} la Pati-Salam, one is
forced to introduce new neutral particles which are singlets under the Standard
Model (SM). These ""sterile neutrinos"" which exist in both helicities and which
are different in nature from the popular particles with the same name can have
their own seesaw with masses in the keV range for the lighter of the two
eigenstates. The keV sterile neutrinos have been discussed in the literature as
warm dark matter candidates with wide ranging astrophysical consequences such
as structure formation, supernova asymetries, pulsar kicks, etc..In addition,
the model contains W-like and Z-like heavy gauge bosons which might be
accessible at the LHC or the ILC. An argument is presented on why, in this
model, it is natural to have four families which can obey existing constraints.

magnet. The model has a spin liquid groundstate and is constructed so as to
mimic the macroscopically large quasi-degeneracies expected in the low-lying
energy structure of a Kagome system. We use numerical studies of finite size
systems to investigate the static as well as the dynamical response at finite
temperatures. The results obtained using our simple model are compatible with a
large number of recent experiments including neutron scattering data. Our study
suggests that many of the anomalous features observed in experiments have a
natural interpretation in terms of a spin-1/2 defects (impurities) coupled to
an underlying Kagome-type spin liquid.

joined in an atomic nucleus. Phenomenological nuclear potentials, fitted to
experimental data, allow one to know about the nuclear behaviour with more or
less success where quantum mechanics is hard to be used. A nuclear potential is
suggested and an expression for the potential energy of two nuclear entities,
either nuclei or nucleons, is developed. In order to estimate parameters in
this expression, some nucleon additions to nuclei are considered and a model is
suggested as a guide of the addition process. Coulomb barrier and energy for
the addition of a proton to each one of several nuclei are estimated by taking
into account both the nuclear and electrostatic components of energy. Studies
on the binding energies of several nuclei and on the fusion reaction of two
nuclei are carried out.
