  Sc. 9099, 169 (2015)",,,"quant-ph nlin.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum dynamics can be regarded as a generalization of classical
finite-state dynamics. This is a familiar viewpoint for workers in quantum
computation, which encompasses classical computation as a special case. Here
this viewpoint is extended to mechanics, where classical dynamics has
traditionally been viewed as a macroscopic approximation of quantum behavior,
not as a special case.
  When a classical dynamics is recast as a special case of quantum dynamics,
the quantum description can be interpreted classically. For example, sometimes
extra information is added to the classical state in order to construct the
quantum description. This extra information is then eliminated by representing
it in a superposition as if it were unknown information about a classical
statistical ensemble. This usage of superposition leads to the appearance of
Fermions in the quantum description of classical lattice-gas dynamics and turns
continuous-space descriptions of finite-state systems into illustrations of
classical sampling theory.
  A direct mapping of classical systems onto quantum systems also allows us to
determine the minimum possible energy scale for a classical dynamics, based on
a localized rate of state change. We use a partitioning description of dynamics
to define locality, and discuss the ideal energy of two model systems.

fluxes in Type II string compactifications with N=1 supersymmetry. The
mediation arises due to an U(1) vector multiplet coupling to both a hidden
supersymmetry breaking flux sector and a visible D-brane sector. The required
internal manifolds can be constructed by non-Kaehler resolutions of singular
Calabi-Yau manifolds. The effective action encoding the U(1) coupling is then
determined in terms of the global topological properties of the internal space.
We investigate suitable local geometries for the hidden and visible sector in
detail. This includes a systematic study of orientifold symmetries of del Pezzo
surfaces realized in compact geometries after geometric transition. We
construct compact examples admitting the key properties to realize flux
supersymmetry breaking and U(1) mediation. Their toric realization allows us to
analyze the geometry of curve classes and confirm the topological connection
between the hidden and visible sector.

the sub-parsec/parsec scale where the dynamical friction with the neighboring
stars is no longer effective (the so-called the final parsec problem). In this
paper, we propose a new mechanism by which the massive BBH can naturally
coalesce within a Hubble time. We study the evolution of the BBH with triple
disks which are composed of an accretion disk around each black hole and one
circumbinary disk surrounding them. While the circumbinary disk removes the
orbital angular momentum of the BBH via the binary-disk resonant interaction,
the mass transfer from the circumbinary disk to each black hole adds some
fraction of its angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum of the BBH. We
find that there is a critical value of the mass-transfer rate where the
extraction of the orbital angular momentum from the BBH is balanced with the
addition of the orbital angular momentum to the BBH. The semi-major axis of the
BBH decays with time whereas the orbital eccentricity of the BBH grows with
time, if the mass transfer rate is smaller than the critical one, and vice
versa. Its evolutionary timescale is characterized by the product of the
viscous timescale of the circumbinary disk and the ratio of the total black
hole mass to the mass of the circumbinary disk. Since a minimum value of the
critical mass-transfer rate is larger than the Eddington accretion rate of
massive black holes with masses in the 10^{6}M_{sun} to $10^{9}M_{sun} range,
it is promising that the critical mass-transfer rate is larger than the mass
transfer rate. Most of massive BBHs, therefore, enable to merge within a Hubble
time by the proposed mechanism, which helps to solve the final parsec problem.

basis function (CBF) theory to include the strong, short range spatial
correlations due to realistic nuclear forces and the pairing correlations of

contains central as well as tensor components. The correlated BCS scheme of
Ref. [Nucl. Phys. A363 (1981) 383], developed for simple scalar correlations,
is generalized to this more realistic case. The energy of the correlated pair
condensed phase of neutron matter is evaluated at the two--body order of the
cluster expansion, but considering the one--body density and the corresponding
energy vertex corrections at the first order of the Power Series expansion.
Based on these approximations, we have derived a system of Euler equations for
the correlation factors and for the BCS amplitudes, resulting in correlated non
linear gap equations, formally close to the standard BCS ones. These equations
have been solved for the momentum independent part of several realistic
potentials (Reid, Argonne v_{14} and Argonne v_{8'}) to stress the role of the
tensor correlations and of the many--body effects. Simple Jastrow correlations
and/or the lack of the density corrections enhance the gap with respect to
uncorrelated BCS, whereas it is reduced according to the strength of the tensor
interaction and following the inclusion of many--body contributions.

Various general dynamical results supporting this construction, such as the
light-wedge causality condition and the integrability condition for
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, are presented. Based on this analysis, the claim

evolution in the high redshift universe. However, without a rigorous
understanding of the processes which regulate the Lya escape fraction, physical
interpretations of high-z observations remain questionable. We examine six
nearby star-forming galaxies to disentangle the role of the dust from other
parameters such as gas kinematics, geometry and ISM morphology in the
obscuration of Ly-alpha. Thereby we aim to understand the Ly-a escape physics
and infer the implications for high-redshift studies. We use HST/ACS to produce
continuum-subtracted Lya maps, and ground-based observations (ESO/NTT and NOT)
to map the Halpha emission and the extinction E(B-V) in the gas phase derived
from the Balmer decrement Halpha/Hbeta. When large outflows are present, the
Lya emission appears not to correlate with the dust content, confirming the
role of the HI kinematics in the escape of Lya photons. In the case of a dense,
static HI covering, we observe a damped absorption with a declining
relationship between Lya and E(B-V). We found that the Lya escape fraction does
not exceed 10% in all our galaxies and is mostly about 3% or below. Finally,
because of the radiative transfer complexity of the Lya line, star formation
rate based on Lya luminosity is underestimated with respect to that derived
from UV luminosity. The failure of simple dust correction to recover the
intrinsic Lya/Ha ratio or the total star formation rate should prompt us to be
more cautious when interpreting high-z observations and related properties,
such as SFRs based on Lya alone. To this end we propose a more realistic
calibration for SFR(Lya) which accounts for dust attenuation and resonant
scattering effects via the Lya escape fraction.

Observatory (OVRO) millimeter interferometer. In each system, the 3 mm
continuum maps show dust emission at the location of the primary star, but no
emission at the position of the secondary. This result is different from
observations of less evolved Class 0 binaries, in which dust emission is
detected from both sources. The nondetection of secondary disks is, however,
similar to the dust distribution seen in wide Class II Taurus binaries. The
combined OVRO results from the Ophiuchus and Taurus binaries suggest that
secondary disk masses are significantly lower than primary disk masses by the
Class II stage, with initial evidence that massive secondary disks are reduced
by the Class I stage. Although some of the secondaries retain hot inner disk
material, the early dissipation of massive outer disks may negatively impact
planet formation around secondary stars. Masses for the circumprimary disks are
within the range of masses measured for disks around single T Tauri stars and,
in some cases, larger than the minimum mass solar nebula. More massive primary
disks are predicted by several formation models and are broadly consistent with
the observations. Combining the 3 mm data with previous 1.3 mm observations,
the dust opacity power-law index for each primary disk is estimated. The
opacity index values are all less than the scaling for interstellar dust,
possibly indicating grain growth within the circumprimary disks.

recently launched program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of
computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that logic has more
traditionally been. Formulas in it represent computational problems, ""truth""
means existence of an algorithmic solution, and proofs encode such solutions.
Within the line of research devoted to finding axiomatizations for ever more
expressive fragments of CL, the present paper introduces a new deductive system
CL12 and proves its soundness and completeness with respect to the semantics of
CL. Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering
considerable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a
reasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical
logic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such
theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano
arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of
the present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author
wishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of
interesting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual
metatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems.

low-energy ``fluctuating stripes''. We study the quantum critical behavior and
find evidence that, contrary to the classical case, the gauge-type of coupling
between the nematic and smectic is irrelevant at this QCP. The collective modes

the low-energy bosonic modes on the fermionic quasiparticles are studied
perturbatively, for both a model with full rotational symmetry and for a system

that at the nematic-smectic critical point, due to the critical smectic
fluctuations, the dynamics of the fermionic quasiparticles near several points

Landau Fermi liquid theory. On the other hand, the quasiparticles in the

subspaces of the vector space $\F_q^{n}$. In this work, we consider
error-correcting codes in the projective space, focusing mainly on constant
dimension codes. We start with the different representations of subspaces in
the projective space. These representations involve matrices in reduced row
echelon form, associated binary vectors, and Ferrers diagrams. Based on these
representations, we provide a new formula for the computation of the distance
between any two subspaces in the projective space. We examine lifted maximum
rank distance (MRD) codes, which are nearly optimal constant dimension codes.
We prove that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a way that it forms
a block design known as a transversal design. The incidence matrix of the
transversal design derived from a lifted MRD code can be viewed as a
parity-check matrix of a linear code in the Hamming space. We find the
properties of these codes which can be viewed also as LDPC codes. We present
new bounds and constructions for constant dimension codes. First, we present a
multilevel construction for constant dimension codes, which can be viewed as a
generalization of a lifted MRD codes construction. This construction is based
on a new type of rank-metric codes, called Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes.
Then we derive upper bounds on the size of constant dimension codes which
contain the lifted MRD code, and provide a construction for two families of
codes, that attain these upper bounds. We generalize the well-known concept of
a punctured code for a code in the projective space to obtain large codes which
are not constant dimension. We present efficient enumerative encoding and
decoding techniques for the Grassmannian. Finally we describe a search method
for constant dimension lexicodes.

mergers give rise to two-component profiles: an outer profile established by
violent relaxation acting on stars present in the progenitors prior to the
final merger, and an inner stellar population comprising the extra light,
formed in a compact starburst. Combining a large set of hydrodynamical
simulations with data that span a broad range of profiles and masses, we show
that this picture is borne out -- cusp ellipticals are indeed 'extra light'
ellipticals -- and examine how the properties of this component scale with
global galaxy properties. We show how to robustly separate the 'extra' light,
and demonstrate that observed cusps are reliable tracers of the degree of
dissipation in the spheroid-forming merger. We show that the typical degree of
dissipation is a strong function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas
fractions at each mass. We demonstrate a correlation between extra light
content and effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation are
more compact. The outer shape of the light profile does not depend on mass,
with a mean outer Sersic index ~2.5. We explore how this relates to shapes,
kinematics, and stellar population gradients. Simulations with the gas content
needed to match observed profiles also reproduce observed age, metallicity, and
color gradients, and we show how these can be used as tracers of the degree of
dissipation in spheroid formation.

of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We discuss the main binary interactions, i.e.,
stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and common envelope (CE) evolution, and show
evolutionary channels leading to the formation of various binary-related
objects. In the first example, we show that the binary model of sdB stars of
Han et al. (2002, 2003) can reproduce field sdB stars and their counterparts,
extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars, in globular clusters. By applying the
binary model to the study of evolutionary population synthesis, we have
obtained an ``a priori'' model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies and
showed that the UV-upturn is most likely resulted from binary interactions.
This has major implications for understanding the evolution of the UV excess

single degenerate channel and the double degenerate channel for the progenitors

observation of either H+ --> tau+ nubar or H+ --> e+ nubar will be particularly

the first stars in the universe, the baryonic infall compresses the dark matter
further. The resultant dark matter density is presented here, using an
algorithm originally developed by Young to calculate changes to the profile as
the result of adiabatic infall in a spherical halo model; the Young
prescription takes into account the non-circular motions of halo particles. The
density profiles obtained in this way are found to be within a factor of two of
those obtained using the simple adiabatic contraction prescription of
Blumenthal et al. Our results hold regardless of the nature of the dark matter
or its interactions and rely merely on gravity. If the dark matter consists of
weakly interacting massive particles, which are their own antiparticles, their
densities are high enough that their annihilation in the first protostars can
indeed provide an important heat source and prevent the collapse all the way to
fusion. In short, a ``Dark Star'' phase of stellar evolution, powered by DM
annihilation, may indeed describe the first stars in the universe.

example of protein assemblies that communicate ligand binding through
allosteric change. The switch is a dimeric complex of troponin C (TnC), an
allosteric sensor for Ca, and troponin I (TnI), an allosteric reporter.
Time-resolved equilibrium FRET measurements suggest that the switch activates
in two steps: a TnI-independent Ca-priming step followed by TnI-dependent
opening. To resolve the mechanistic role of TnI in activation we performed
stopped-flow FRET measurements of activation following rapid addition of a
lacking component (Ca or TnI) and deactivation following rapid chelation of Ca.
The time-resolved measurements, stopped-flow measurements, and Ca-titration
measurements were globally analyzed in terms of a new quantitative dynamic
model of TnC-TnI allostery. The analysis provided a mesoscopic parameterization
of distance changes, free energy changes, and transition rates among the
accessible coarse-grained states of the system. The results reveal (i) the
Ca-induced priming step, which precedes opening, is the rate limiting step in
activation, (ii) closing is the rate limiting step in deactivation, (iii) TnI
induces opening, (iv) an incompletely deactivated population when regulatory Ca
is not bound, which generates an accessory pathway of activation, and (v)
incomplete activation by Ca--when regulatory Ca is bound, a 3:2 mixture of
dynamically inter-converting open (active) and primed-closed (partially active)
conformers is observed (15 C). Temperature-dependent stopped-flow FRET
experiments provide a near complete thermo-kinetic parametrization of opening.

the algebraic. The exponential model is a one-parameter (r) model, and the
algebraic model is a two-parameter (r,m) model, where r is the ratio of the
characteristic wetting length to the height of the unperturbed film, and m is
the exponent of h (film height) in a smooth function that interpolates the

The exponential model gives monotonically decreasing (with h) wetting chemical
potential, while this dependence is monotonic only for the m=1 case of the
algebraic model. Linear stability analysis of the planar equilibrium surface is
performed. Simulations of the surface dynamics in the strongly nonlinear regime
(large deviations from the planar equilibrium) and for large surface energy

anthropic prediction is validated. However, we argue that for small $c$, the

proposed for the half-filled Hubbard model. We show that with the addition of a
gauge variable, the formalism can be extended to finite doping. The resulting
spin problem can be solved using the cluster mean-field approximation. This
approximation takes short-range correlations into account by exact
diagonalization on the cluster, whereas long-range correlations beyond the size
of clusters are treated at the mean-field level. In the limit where the cluster
has only one site and the interaction strength $U$ is infinite, this approach
reduces to the Gutzwiller approximation. There are some qualitative differences
when the size of the cluster is finite. We first compute the critical $U$ for
the Mott transition as a function of a frustrating second-neighbor interaction
on lattices relevant for various correlated systems, namely the cobaltites, the
layered organic superconductors and the high-temperature superconductors. For
the triangular lattice, we also study the extended Hubbard model with
nearest-neighbor repulsion. In additionto a uniform metallic state, we find a
$\sqrt(3) \times \sqrt(3)$ charge density wave in a broad doping regime,
including commensurate ones. We find that in the large $U$ limit, intersite
Coulomb repulsion $V$ strongly suppresses the single-particle weight of the
metallic state.

this phenomenon, and give parameters of its emission-line spectrum comprising

a positive volume form on M. Let D^+(M) denote the group of orientation
preserving diffeomorphisms of M endowed with the compact-open C^infty topology
and D(M; omega) denote the subgroup of omega-preserving diffeomorphisms of M.
In this paper we propose a unified approach for realization of mass transfer
toward ends by diffeomorphisms of M. This argument together with Moser's
theorem enables us to deduce two selection theorems for the groups D^+(M) and
D(M; omega). The first one is the extension of Moser's theorem to noncompact
manifolds, that is, the existence of sections for the orbit maps under the
action of D^+(M) on the space of volume forms. This implies that D(M; omega) is
a strong deformation retract of the group D^+(M; E^omega_M) consisting of h in
D^+(M) which preserves the set E^omega_M of omega-finite ends of M. The second
one is related to the mass flow toward ends under volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms of M. Let D_{E_M}(M; omega) denote the subgroup consisting of
all h in D(M; omega) which fix the ends E_M of M. S.R.Alpern and V.S.Prasad
introduced the topological vector space S(M; omega) of end charges of M and the
end charge homomorphism c^omega : D_{E_M}(M; omega) to S(M; omega), which
measures the mass flow toward ends induced by each h in D_{E_M}(M; omega). We
show that the homomorphism c^omega has a continuous section. This induces the
factorization D_{E_M}(M; omega) cong ker c^omega times S(M; omega) and it
implies that ker c^omega is a strong deformation retract of D_{E_M}(M; omega).

based on LTE and NLTE level populations. The results will be used in a
forthcoming paper for differential abundance analyses of metal-poor stars. A
detailed analysis of silicon line spectra leads to setting up realistic model
atoms, which are exposed to interactions in plane-parallel solar atmospheric
models. The resulting departure coefficients are entered into a line-by-line
analysis of the visible and near-infrared solar silicon spectrum. The
statistical equilibrium of \ion{Si}{i} turns out to depend marginally on
bound-free interaction processes, both radiative and collisional. Bound-bound
interaction processes do not play a significant role either, except for
hydrogen collisions, which have to be chosen adequately for fitting the cores
of the near-infrared lines. Except for some near-infrared lines, the NLTE
influence on the abundances is weak. Taking the deviations from LTE in silicon
into account, it is possible to calculate the ionisation equilibrium from
neutral and ionised lines. The solar abundance based on the experimental
$f$-values of Garz corrected for the Becker et al.'s measurement is $7.52 \pm
0.05$. Combined with an extended line sample with selected NIST $f$-values, the
solar abundance is $7.52 \pm 0.06$, with a nearly perfect ionisation

multi-electron hops that each go to the nearest neighbor but are synchronized
to move charge over distances of several particles. In order to test how the

clusters of nodes. We derive the network throughput of this communication
scheme and determine the optimal cluster size. This provides a constructive
lower bound on the network capacity. We first show that in \textit{regular

scaling of $\Theta(N^{\frac{\alpha}{6}-{1/3}})$, where $\alpha>2$ is the signal

$\Theta(N^{\alpha/6-1/3}(\log{N})^{-(\alpha-2)^2/6})$ in a random network with

sources in the universe, a signature of which is non-thermal hard X-ray
emission from the accelerated relativistic particles. We present early results
on Suzaku observations of non-thermal emission from Abell 3376, which is a
nearby on-going merger cluster. Suzaku observed the cluster twice, focusing on
the cluster center containing the diffuse radio emission to the east, and
cluster peripheral region to the west. For both observations, we detect no
excess hard X-ray emission above the thermal cluster emission. An upper limit
on the non-thermal X-ray flux of $2.1\times10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
(15--50 keV) at the 3$\sigma$ level from a $34\times34$ arcmin$^2$ region,
derived with the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), is similar to that obtained with
the BeppoSAX/PDS. Using the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) data, the upper
limit on the non-thermal emission from the West Relic is independently
constrained to be $<1.1\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (4$-$8 keV) at
the 3$\sigma$ level from a 122 arcmin$^2$ region. Assuming Compton scattering
between relativistic particles and the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
photons, the intracluster magnetic field $B$ is limited to be $>0.03\mu$G (HXD)
and $>0.10\mu$G (XIS).

aspect of preventive medical science. This paper proposes a new coupled
loading-rate hypothesis for the traumatic brain injury (TBI), which states that
the main cause of the TBI is an external Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an
impulsive loading that strikes the head in several coupled degrees-of-freedom
simultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force
law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of brain's micro-motions
within the cerebrospinal fluid and derive from it the coupled SE(3)-jolt
dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is a cause of the TBI in two forms of brain's rapid
discontinuous deformations: translational dislocations and rotational
disclinations. Brain's dislocations and disclinations, caused by the
SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum
brain model.

the choice of the importance sampling distribution. A good choice is often hard
to achieve especially for high-dimensional integration problems. Nonparametric
estimation of the optimal importance sampling distribution (known as
nonparametric importance sampling) is a reasonable alternative to parametric
approaches.In this article nonparametric variants of both the self-normalized
and the unnormalized importance sampling estimator are proposed and
investigated. A common critique on nonparametric importance sampling is the
increased computational burden compared to parametric methods. We solve this
problem to a large degree by utilizing the linear blend frequency polygon
estimator instead of a kernel estimator. Mean square error convergence
properties are investigated leading to recommendations for the efficient
application of nonparametric importance sampling. Particularly, we show that
nonparametric importance sampling asymptotically attains optimal importance
sampling variance. The efficiency of nonparametric importance sampling
algorithms heavily relies on the computational efficiency of the employed
nonparametric estimator. The linear blend frequency polygon outperforms kernel
estimators in terms of certain criteria such as efficient sampling and
evaluation. Furthermore, it is compatible with the inversion method for sample
generation. This allows to combine our algorithms with other variance reduction
techniques such as stratified sampling. Empirical evidence for the usefulness
of the suggested algorithms is obtained by means of three benchmark integration
problems. As an application we estimate the distribution of the queue length of
a spam filter queueing system based on real data.

on the empirical regularities of order placement and cancelation in a purely
order-driven market, which can successfully reproduce the whole distribution of
returns, not only the well-known power-law tails, together with several other
important stylized facts. There are three key ingredients in the Mike-Farmer
(MF) model: the long memory of order signs characterized by the Hurst index
$H_s$, the distribution of relative order prices $x$ in reference to the same
best price described by a Student distribution (or Tsallis' $q$-Gaussian), and
the dynamics of order cancelation. They showed that different values of the
Hurst index $H_s$ and the freedom degree $\alpha_x$ of the Student distribution
can always produce power-law tails in the return distribution $f(r)$ with
different tail exponent $\alpha_r$. In this paper, we study the origin of the
power-law tails of the return distribution $f(r)$ in the MF model, based on
extensive simulations with different combinations of the left part $f_L(x)$ for
$x<0$ and the right part $f_R(x)$ for $x>0$ of $f(x)$. We find that power-law
tails appear only when $f_L(x)$ has a power-law tail, no matter $f_R(x)$ has a
power-law tail or not. In addition, we find that the distributions of returns
in the MF model at different timescales can be well modeled by the Student
distributions, whose tail exponents are close to the well-known cubic law and
increase with the timescale.

melt are used to study the accuracy with which the entropy of ionic and
molecular liquids can be estimated from atom-atom radial distribution function
data. All three systems are known to display similar liquid-state thermodynamic
and kinetic anomalies due to a region of anomalous excess entropy behaviour
where entropy rises on isothermal compression. The pair correlation entropy is
demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate that the density-temperature regime of
anomalous behaviour as well as the strength of the entropy anomaly can be
predicted reliably for both ionic melts as well as different rigid-body pair
potentials for water. Errors in the total thermodynamic entropy for ionic melts
due to the pair correlation approximation are of the order of 10% or less for
most state points but can be significantly larger in the anomalous regime at
very low temperatures. In the case of water, as expected given the rigid-body
constraints for a molecular liquids, the pair correlation approximation causes
significantly larger errors, between 20 and 30%, for most state points.
Comparison of the excess entropy, Se, of ionic melts with the pair correlation
entropy, S2, shows that the temperature dependence of Se is well described by T
??2=5 scaling across both the normal and anomalous regimes, unlike in the case
of S2. As a function of density, the Se(rho) curves shows only a single maximum
while the S2(rho) curves show both a maximum and a minimum. These differences
in the behaviour of S2 and Se are due to the fact that the residual
multiparticle entropy, delta(S) = Se - S2, shows a strong negative correlation
with tetrahedral order in the anomalous regime.

introduce a new methodology, called gene profiling, that uses simultaneous
differential and equivalent gene expression level testing to rank genes
according to a pre-specified gene expression profile. Gene profiling treats the
vector of true gene expression levels as a linear combination of appropriate
vectors, i.e., vectors that give the required criteria for the profile. This
gene-profile model is fitted to the data and the resultant parameter estimates
are summarized in a single test statistic that is then used to rank the genes.
The theoretical underpinnings of gene profiling (equivalence testing,
intersection-union tests) are discussed in this paper, and the gene profiling
methodology is applied to our motivating stem cell experiment.

(Lya) line profiles and strengths in Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lya
emitters (LAEs), the physical parameters governing them, and hence deriving
constraints on the gas and dust content and stellar populations of these
objects.
  Using our 3D Lya radiation transfer code including gas and dust (Verhamme et
al. 2006), we fit 11 LBGs from the FORS Deep Field with redshifts between 2.8
and 5 observed by Tapken et al. (2007). A simple geometry of a spherically
expanding shell of HI is adopted.
  RESULTS : The variety of observed Lya profiles is successfully reproduced.
Most objects show outflow velocities of 150-200 km/s; two objects are most
likely quasi-static. The radial HI column density ranges from NH=2.10^{19} to
7.10^{20} cm^{-2}. Our Lya profile fits yield values of E(B-V)~0.05-0.2 for the
gas extinction. We find indications for a dust-to-gas ratio higher than the
Galactic value, and for a substantial scatter. The escape fraction of Lya
photons is found to be determined primarily by the extinction, and a simple fit
formula is proposed. Intrinsic EW(Lya)~50-100 Angstroms are found for 8/11
objects, as expected for stellar populations forming constantly over long
periods (> 10-100 Myr). In three cases we found indications for younger
populations. Correlations between the observed EW(Lya) and other observables
such as FWHM(Lya), E(B-V),SFR(UV) etc, are reproduced. We also show that there
is a clear overlap between LBGs and LAEs. Radiation transfer and dust effects
explain the increase of the LAE/LBG ratio, and a higher percentage of LBGs with
strong Lya emission with increasing redshift. [shortened]

The source was observed in its highest flux state to date, and we find that it
brightened by about 20 per cent during the observation. We see evidence of
spectral hardening as the count rate increases and also find that the rms
variability increases with energy up to about 4 keV. We clearly detect a
broadened Fe line but conclude that it does not require any emission from
inside about 50 r_g, although a much smaller inner radius cannot be ruled out.
The large inner radius of our best fit implies that the inner disc is either
missing or not strongly illuminated. We suggest that the latter scenario may
occur if the power-law source is located high above the disc, or if the
emission is beamed away from the disc.

  Reliability","16 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Equivocation rate has been widely used as an information-theoretic measure of
security after Shannon[10]. It simplifies problems by removing the effect of
atypical behavior from the system. In [9], however, Merhav and Arikan
considered the alternative of using guessing exponent to analyze the Shannon's
cipher system. Because guessing exponent captures the atypical behavior, the
strongest expressible notion of secrecy requires the more stringent condition
that the size of the key, instead of its entropy rate, to be equal to the size
of the message. The relationship between equivocation and guessing exponent are
also investigated in [6][7] but it is unclear which is a better measure, and
whether there is a unifying measure of security.
  Instead of using equivocation rate or guessing exponent, we study the wiretap
channel in [2] using the success exponent, defined as the exponent of a
wiretapper successfully learn the secret after making an exponential number of
guesses to a sequential verifier that gives yes/no answer to each guess. By
extending the coding scheme in [2][5] and the converse proof in [4] with the
new Overlap Lemma 5.2, we obtain a tradeoff between secrecy and reliability
expressed in terms of lower bounds on the error and success exponents of
authorized and respectively unauthorized decoding of the transmitted messages.
  From this, we obtain an inner bound to the region of strongly achievable
public, private and guessing rate triples for which the exponents are strictly
positive. The closure of this region is equivalent to the closure of the region
in Theorem 1 of [2] when we treat equivocation rate as the guessing rate.
However, it is unclear if the inner bound is tight.

trajectories. The proposed strategy is applicable to cases when the input
trajectories are generated by subjecting the system to a external
time-dependent force (as opposed to canonically-equilibrated trajectories).
Secondly, it provides an explicit control on the statistical uncertainty of the
drift and diffusion profiles. These features lend to the possibility of
designing the external force driving the system so to maximize the accuracy of
the drift and diffusions profile throughout the phase space of interest.
Quantitative criteria are also provided to assess a posteriori the
satisfiability of the requisites for applying the method, namely the Markovian

its structure and kinematical properties, two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations have been carried out. Numerical calculations reveal that the
striking features in NGC 6782 can be reproduced provided that the gas flow is
governed by the gravitational potential associated with a slowly rotating
strong bar. In particular, the response of the gaseous disk to the bar
potential leads to the excitation of spiral density waves at the inner Lindblad
resonance giving rise to the appearance of a nearly circular nuclear ring with
a pair of dust lanes. For a sufficiently strong bar potential, the inner 4:1
spiral density waves are also excited. The interaction of the higher harmonic
waves with the waves excited at the inner Lindblad resonance and confined by
the outer Lindblad resonance results in the observed diamond-shaped (or pointy
oval) inner ring structure. The overall gas morphology and kinematical features
are both well reproduced by the model provided that the pattern speed of the
bar is $\sim 25$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.

Navier-Stokes equations by smoothing the advective transport. Here we assess
the potential of the Leray-$\alpha$ model in its standard formulation to
simulate wall-bounded flows. Three flow cases are considered: plane channel
flow at $\Re_\tau=590$, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at $\Ra=10^7$ and
$\Pr=1$, and a side-heated vertical channel at $\Ra=5 \times 10^6$ and
$\Pr=0.7$. The simulations are compared to results from a well resolved and
coarse DNS. It is found that for all three flow cases, the variance in the
velocity field increases as the filter width parameter $a$ is increased, where
$a$ is connected to the filter width as $\alpha_i = a \Delta x_i$, with $\Delta
x_i$ the local grid size. Furthermore, the viscous and diffusive wall regions
tend to thicken relative to the coarse DNS results as a function of $a$. In the
cases where coarse DNS overpredicts wall gradients (as for Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection and the side-heated vertical channel), the thickening is beneficial.
However, for the plane channel flow, coarse DNS underpredicts the wall-shear
velocity, and increasing $a$ only degrades the results. It is shown that
buoyancy effects need to be included with care, because of the close relation
of turbulent heat flux and the production of turbulent kinetic energy.

vortex state. It was found that for extreme type-II superconductors and low
magnetic fields, the fitted value of $\lambda$ is practically independent of
$\xi$. The second-moment method frequently used to analyze $\mu$SR spectra by
means of a multi-component Gaussian fit, generally yields reliable values of
$\lambda$ in the whole range of applied fields $ H_{c1} \ll H \lesssim H_{c2}$
($H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ are the first and second critical fields, respectively).
These results are also relevant for the interpretation of small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS) experiments of the vortex state in type-II superconductors.

angular momentum transport and material transport in a rotating solar model. We
assumed that the transport of both angular momentum and chemical elements
caused by magnetic fields could be treated as a diffusion process. The
diffusion coefficient depends on the stellar radius, angular velocity, and the
configuration of magnetic fields. By using of this coefficient, it is found
that our model becomes more consistent with the helioseismic results of total
angular momentum, angular momentum density, and the rotation rate in a
radiative region than the one without magnetic fields. Not only can the
magnetic fields redistribute angular momentum efficiently, but they can also
strengthen the coupling between the radiative and convective zones. As a
result, the sharp gradient of the rotation rate is reduced at the bottom of the
convective zone. The thickness of the layer of sharp radial change in the
rotation rate is about 0.036 $R_{\odot}$ in our model. Furthermore, the
difference of the sound-speed square between the seismic Sun and the model is
improved by mixing the material that is associated with angular momentum
transport.

12CO(J=2-1) with the Submillieter Array (SMA). The 12CO(J=2-1) map shows a
central concentration and a surrounding ring, which coincide respectively with
the Seyfert nucleus and a starburst ring. The line intensity peaks at the
nucleus, whereas in a previously published 12CO(J=1-0) map the intensity peaks
at the starburst ring. The molecular ring has an azimuthally averaged
12CO(J=2-1)/(J=1-0) intensity ratio (R21) of about unity, which is similar to
those in nearby active star forming galaxies, suggesting that most of the
molecular mass in the ring is involved in fueling the starburst. The molecular
gas can last for only about 1.2\times10^8 years without further replenishment
assuming a constant star formation rate and a perfect conversion of gas to
stars. The velocity map shows that the central molecular gas is rotating with
the molecular ring in the same direction, while its velocity gradient is much
steeper than that of the ring. This velocity gradient of the central gas is
similar to what is usually observed in some Seyfert 2 galaxies. To view the
active nucleus directly in the optical, the central molecular gas structure can
either be a low-inclined disk or torus but not too low to be less massive than
the mass of the host galaxy itself, be a highly-inclined thin disk or clumpy
and thick torus, or be an inner part of the galactic disk. The R21 value of
~1.9 of the central molecular gas component, which is significantly higher than
the value found at the molecular gas ring, indicates that the activity of the
Seyfert nucleus may have a significant influence on the conditions of the
molecular gas in the central component.

absorption and emission of elementary dislocations, is found to be facilitated
by curvature walls connecting interacting disclinations. At intermediate times

only the off-shell form of the scattering matrix. These terms are of higher

well as quantitative description which can be applied to LMC/SMC-type stellar
populations. For that purpose we apply the same approach as we did for solar
metallicity stars and calculate hydrodynamical wind models including dust
formation with LMC and SMC abundances under consideration of an adapted model
assumption. In particular, we improved the treatment of the radiative transfer
problem in order to accommodate larger non-local contributions occurring with
smaller opacities. For each wind model we determine an averaged mass-loss rate.
The resulting, approximate mass-loss formulae are then applied to well-tested
and calibrated stellar evolution calculations in order to quantify the stellar
mass loss. The dynamical models for LMC and SMC metallicity result in mass-loss
rates of the same order of magnitude as the solar metallicity models which is
in this basic approach in agreement with observations. The hydrodynamical
properties like e.g. the outflow velocity differ (for fixed C/O abundance
ratio) noticeably, though. While critical luminosities of LMC and solar
metallicity models fairly coincide, the SMC models need higher luminosities to
develop dust-driven winds.
