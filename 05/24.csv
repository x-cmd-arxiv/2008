scale-dependent bias, whose amplitude is growing with scale. Here we first
rederive this result within the context of peak-background split formalism and
show that it only depends on the assumption of universality of mass function,
assuming halo bias only depends on mass. We then use extended Press-Schechter
formalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependent
bias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. In
particular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed.
Next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scale
data to put a limit on the value of f_NL. When combining all data assuming that
halo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 ~ (-65)< f_NL
< +70 ~(+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. While we use a wide range of datasets,
our combined result is dominated by the signal from the SDSS photometric quasar
sample. If the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to
-31 ~(-96) < f_NL < +70 ~ (+96) . These limits are comparable to the strongest
current limits from the WMAP 5 year analysis, with no evidence of a positive
signal in f_NL. While the method needs to be thoroughly tested against large
scale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models,
our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to CMB and
should be further pursued both observationally and theoretically.

beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) physics at the Tevatron. The results reported
correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.5 fb-1 of Run II data
collected by the two Collaborations. Searches covered include: the standard
model (SM) Higgs boson (including sensitivity projections), the neutral Higgs
bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM),
charged Higgs bosons and extended Higgs models, supersymmetric decays that
conserve or violate R-parity, gauge-mediated supersymmetric breaking models,
long-lived particles, leptoquarks, compositeness, extra gauge bosons, extra
dimensions, and finally signature-based searches. Given the excellent
performance of the collider and the continued productivity of the experiments,
the Tevatron physics potential looks promising for discovery with the coming
larger data sets. In particular, evidence for the SM Higgs boson could be
obtained if its mass is light or near 160 GeV. The observed (expected) upper
limits are currently a factor of 3.7 (3.3) higher than the expected SM Higgs

the literature for other Local Group galaxies, we consider the origin and
evolution of the stellar progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in galaxies
where star formation ceased long ago. The ratio of neon to oxygen abundances in
bright planetary nebulae is either identical to that measured in the
interstellar medium of star-forming dwarf galaxies or at most changed by a few
percent, indicating that neither abundance is significantly altered as a result
of the evolution of their stellar progenitors. Several planetary nebulae appear
to have dredged up oxygen, but these are the exception, not the rule. The
progenitors of bright planetary nebulae typically enhance their original helium
abundances by less than 50%. In contrast, nitrogen enhancements can reach
factors of 100. However, nitrogen often shows little or no enhancement,
suggesting that nitrogen enrichment is a random process. The helium, oxygen,
and neon abundances argue that the typical bright planetary nebulae in all of
the galaxies considered here are the progeny of stars with initial masses of
approximately 1.5 Msun or less, based upon the nucleosynthesis predictions of
current theoretical models. These models, however, are unable to explain the
nitrogen enrichment or its scatter. Similar conclusions hold for the bright
planetary nebulae in galaxies with ongoing star formation. Thus, though
composition varies significantly, there is unity in the sense that the
progenitors of typical bright planetary nebulae appear to have undergone
similar physical processes. (Abridged)

unlikely to establish variability of the solar neutrino flux since the count

examine data from both the Homestake and GALLEX experiments. These show
evidence of modulation with a frequency of 11.85 yr-1, which could be
indicative of rotational modulation originating in the solar core. We find that
precisely the same frequency is prominent in power spectrum analyses of the
ACRIM irradiance data for both the Homestake and GALLEX time intervals. These

this way is only 2 parts in 10,000. This rotation rate is significantly lower
than that of the inner radiative zone (13.97 yr-1) as recently inferred from
analysis of Super-Kamiokande data, suggesting that there may be a second, inner
tachocline separating the core from the radiative zone. This opens up the
possibility that there may be an inner dynamo that could produce a strong
internal magnetic field and a second solar cycle.

is a ground-based experiment to measure the faint ``B-mode'' polarisation
pattern in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To achieve this goal, clover
will make polarimetric observations of approximately 1000 deg^2 of the sky in
spectral bands centred on 97, 150 and 225 GHz. The observations will be made
with a two-mirror compact range antenna fed by profiled corrugated horns. The
telescope beam sizes for each band are 7.5, 5.5 and 5.5 arcmin, respectively.
The polarisation of the sky will be measured with a rotating half-wave plate
and stationary analyser, which will be an orthomode transducer. The sky
coverage combined with the angular resolution will allow us to measure the
angular power spectra between 20 < l < 1000. Each frequency band will employ
192 single polarisation, photon noise limited TES bolometers cooled to 100 mK.
The background-limited sensitivity of these detector arrays will allow us to
constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to 0.026 at 3sigma, assuming any polarised
foreground signals can be subtracted with minimal degradation to the 150 GHz
sensitivity. Systematic errors will be mitigated by modulating the polarisation
of the sky signals with the rotating half-wave plate, fast azimuth scans and
periodic telescope rotations about its boresight. The three spectral bands will
be divided into two separate but nearly identical instruments - one for 97 GHz
and another for 150 and 225 GHz. The two instruments will be sited on identical
three-axis mounts in the Atacama Desert in Chile near Pampa la Bola.
Observations are expected to begin in late 2009.

traditional statistical and clustering procedures in expression profiling, our

explore the cross-correlation of the kSZ generated in groups and clusters to
the all sky E-mode polarization in the context of upcoming CMB experiments like

probing redshifts below $z=3-4$ (where most of baryons cannot be seen), and
that it arises in the very large scales ($l<10$). The significance with which
this cross-correlation can be measured depends on the Poissonian uncertainty
associated to the number of halos where the kSZ is measured and on the accuracy
of the kSZ estimations themselves. Assuming that Planck can provide a cosmic
variance limited E-mode polarization map at $l<20$ and S/N $\sim 1$ kSZ
estimates can be gathered for all clusters more massive than $10^{14}
M_{\odot}$, then this cross-correlation should be measured at the 2--3 $\sigma$
level. Further, if an all-sky ACT or SPT type CMB experiment provides similar
kSZ measurements for all halos above $10^{13} M_{\odot}$, then the
cross-correlation total signal to noise (S/N) ratio should be at the level of
4--5. A detection of this cross-correlation would provide direct and definite

region, one approximately a day earlier that preconditions the solar wind for
the much faster CME on the 28th. This second CME travels through the corona at
a rate of over 2500 km s$^{-1}$ driving a strong forward shock. We clearly
identify this shock in an image produced by the Large Angle Spectrometric
Coronagraph (LASCO) C3, and reproduce the shock and its appearance in synthetic
white light images from the simulation. We find excellent agreement with both
the general morphology and the quantitative brightness of the model CME with
LASCO observations. These results demonstrate that the CME shape is largely
determined by its interaction with the ambient solar wind and may not be
sensitive to the initiation process. We then show how the CME would appear as
observed by wide-angle coronagraphs onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. We find complex time evolution of the
white-light images as a result of the way in which the density structures pass
through the Thomson sphere. The simulation is performed with the Space Weather
Modeling Framework (SWMF).

(ACPS) method. Apply both methods on a Integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) - Large
Scale Structure (LSS) cross correlation scenario and study how sky masks
influence the multipole range where signal arises and its comparison to
theoretical predictions.
  Methods: The MF requires the inversion of a multipole covariance matrix that
if $f_{sky} \lt 1$ is generally non-diagonal and singular. We use a SVD
approach that focuses on those modes carrying most of the information. We
compare the MF to the ACPS in ISW-LSS Monte Carlo simulations, paying attention
on the effect that a limited sky coverage has on the cross-correlation results.
  Results: Within the linear data model for which the MF is defined, the MF
performs comparatively better than the ACPS for smaller values of $f_{sky}$ and
scale dependent (non-Poissonian) noise fields. In the context of ISW studies
both methods are comparable, although the MF performs slightly more sensitively
under more restrictive masks. A preliminary study predicts that most of the
ISW--LSS cross correlation S/N ratio should be found in the very large scales
(50% of the S/N at $l\lt 10$, 90% at $l\lt 40-50$), and this is confirmed by
Monte Carlo simulations. The statistical significance of our cross-correlation
statistics reaches its maximum when considering $l\in [2,l_{max}]$, with
$l_{max} \in[5,40]$ for all values of $f_{sky}$ observed, despite of the
smoothing and power aliasing that aggressive masks introduce in Fourier space.
This $l$-confinement of the ISW-LSS cross correlation should enable a safe
distinction from other secondary effects arising at smaller angular scales.

fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if
we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that
subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the
resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball
configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating
two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we
can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small
and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to
tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been
emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.

real-world communication and transportation networks. We find strong empirical
evidence that the actual capacity of the network elements tends to be similar
to the maximum available capacity, if the cost is not strongly constraining. As
more weight is given to the cost, however, the capacity approaches the load
nonlinearly. In particular, all systems analyzed show larger unoccupied
portions of the capacities on network elements subjected to smaller loads,
which is in sharp contrast with the assumptions involved in (linear) models
proposed in previous theoretical studies. We describe the observed behavior of
the capacity-load relation as a function of the relative importance of the cost

fluctuations. These results suggest that infrastructure systems have evolved
under pressure to minimize local failures, but not necessarily global failures

existence of regions around these objects where no irregular satellites are
observed. Surveys have shown that, around Jupiter, such a region extends from
the outermost regular satellite Callisto, to the vicinity of Themisto, the
innermost irregular satellite. To understand the reason for the existence of
such a satellite-void region, we have studied the dynamical evolution of Jovian
irregulars by numerically integrating the orbits of several hundred test
particles, distributed in a region between 30 and 80 Jupiter-radii, for
different values of their semimajor axes, orbital eccentricities, and
inclinations. As expected, our simulations indicate that objects in or close to
the influence zones of the Galilean satellites become unstable because of
interactions with Ganymede and Callisto. However, these perturbations cannot
account for the lack of irregular satellites in the entire region between
Callisto and Themisto. It is suggested that at distances between 60 and 80
Jupiter-radii, Ganymede and Callisto may have long-term perturbative effects,
which may require the integrations to be extended to times much longer than 10
Myr. The interactions of irregular satellites with protosatellites of Jupiter
at the time of the formation of Jovian regulars may also be a destabilizing
mechanism in this region. We present the results of our numerical simulations
and discuss their applicability to similar satellite void-regions around other
giant planets.

However, when $B$ decreases, the number of filled negative Landau levels
increases, which surprisingly turns out to decrease the amount of Landau level
mixing. The resulting states at fixed filling factor $\nu$ (for $\nu$ not too

fields. Thus in the density-field phase diagram, many different phases may
persist down to the origin, in contrast to the more standard two dimensional
electron gas, in which the origin is surrounded by Wigner crystal states. We
demonstrate that the stripe amplitudes scale roughly as $B$, so that the
density waves ``evaporate'' continuously as $B\to 0$. Tight-binding
calculations give the same scaling for stripe amplitude and demonstrate that
the effect is not an artifact of the cutoff procedure used in the continuum

show that the recently discovered 5-dimensional solution of Lu, Mei and Pope
also admits such integrable distributions, although this does not quite fit
into the story as the obvious associated two-form is not conformal
Killing-Yano. We give conditions on the Weyl curvature tensor imposed by the
existence of a non-degenerate conformal Killing-Yano tensor; these give an
appropriate generalization of the type D condition on a Weyl tensor from four
dimensions.

the eigenvalues, see arXiv:0801.4043. This is a condition on the sign changes
of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue along the oriented bicharacteristics of
the real part.
  In the generic case when the principal symbol does not have constant
characteristics, condition (PSI) is not sufficient, not invariant and in
general not well defined. Instead we study systems which are
quasi-symmetrizable, these systems have natural invariance properties and are
of principal type. We prove that quasi-symmetrizable systems are locally
solvable. We also study the subellipticity of quasi-symmetrizable systems in
the case when principal symbol vanishes of finite order along the
bicharacteristics. In order to prove subellipticity, we assume that the
principal symbol has the approximation property, which implies that there are
no transversal bicharacteristics.

set of long-range links is introduced. Networks parametrized by a positive
integer k are constructed by starting from a one-dimensional lattice and
iteratively connecting each site of degree 2 with a $k$th neighboring site of
degree 2. Specifying the way pairs of sites to be connected are selected,
various random and regular networks are defined, all of which have a power-law
edge-length distribution of the form $P_>(l)\sim l^{-s}$ with the marginal
exponent s=1. In all these networks, lengths of shortest paths grow as a power
of the distance and random walk is super-diffusive. Applying a renormalization
group method, the corresponding shortest-path dimensions and random-walk
dimensions are calculated exactly for k=1 networks and for k=2 regular
networks; in other cases, they are estimated by numerical methods. Although,
s=1 holds for all representatives of this class, the above quantities are found
to depend on the details of the structure of networks controlled by k and other
parameters.
