Fundamental Plane (FP) known to characterize the properties of early-type
galaxies. We reexamine the issue on a sample of 48 GCs selected in terms of
homogeneity criteria for the photometric data available from the literature and
perform a model-independent analysis of surface brightness profiles (SBP) and
distance moduli, estimating error bars and studying selection effects with
non-parametric statistical tests. We determine the coefficients of the FP and
their error bars. The scatter from the FP relation is likely to be intrinsic,
i.e. not due to measurement errors only. We find that in the standard FP
coordinates our sample occupies a slim, axisymmetric region of parameter space,
suggesting that the scaling relation might be around a Fundamental Line, rather
than a plane, confirming a result noted earlier. This is likely to be the
origin of the difficulties in the fit by a plane mentioned in previous
investigations. Such FL relation would imply a pure photometric scaling law,
which might be tested on wider samples and on extra-galactic GC systems. We
find a correlation of the residuals from the FP relation with the central slope
of the SBP. No other correlations are found. Finally, we reconstruct the
distribution of the values of the quantity log(K_V/(M/L)) (virial coefficient
divided by the mass-to-light ratio) through kernel density estimation and find
evidence for bimodality, which suggests that the galactic GC system may be
composed of at least two dynamically different populations. Yet, these
populations do not reflect the standard dichotomy between disk and halo

study the Coxeter group that controls the dynamics for energy scales below the

The group may or may not be a simplex Coxeter group; (ii) The billiard region
may or may not be a fundamental domain. When it is not a fundamental domain, it
can be described as a sequence of pairwise adjacent chambers, known as a

hospitals with serious injuries. Each time a clinician has to urgently take a
patient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma
treatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the
condition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly.
What happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about
the severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can
be fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from
posttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can
we reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been
shown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of
averaging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty
in decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at
selecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We
assume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows
us to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in
decisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce
the cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers. In our experiments we
use the UK Trauma data to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique in
terms of the performance. We also compare the uncertainty in decisions in terms
of entropy.

(<=1,700 year-old), and slow (P=408 ms) radio pulsar associated with the
supernova remnant (SNR) G292.2-0.5. In 2003, Chandra allowed the detection of
the X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar, and provided the first evidence for
a compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We here present new Chandra observations
which allowed for the first time an imaging and spectroscopic study of the
pulsar and PWN independently of each other. The PWN is only evident in the hard
band and consists of jet-like structures extending to at least 7"" from the
pulsar, with the southern `jet' being longer than the northern `jet'. The
spectrum of the PWN is described by a power law with a photon index~1.1 for the
compact PWN and ~1.4 for the southern long jet (at a fixed column density of
1.8E22/cm2), and a total luminosity of 4E32 ergs/s (0.5-7 keV), at a distance
of 8.4 kpc. The pulsar's spectrum is clearly softer than the PWN's spectrum. We
rule out a single blackbody model for the pulsar, and present the first
evidence of non-thermal (presumably magnetospheric) emission that dominates
above ~3keV. A two-component model consisting of a power law component (with
photon index ~1.5--2.0) plus a thermal component provides the best fit. The
thermal component can be fit by either a blackbody model with a temperature
kT~0.21 keV, or a neutron star atmospheric model with a temperature kT~0.14
keV. The efficiency of the pulsar in converting its rotational power, Edot,
into non-thermal X-ray emission from the pulsar and PWN is ~5E-4, comparable to
other rotation-powered pulsars with a similar Edot. We discuss our results in
the context of the X-ray manifestation of high-magnetic field radio pulsars in
comparison with rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars.

in the asymptotic infinity the spacetime approaches $D$-dimensional Minkowski.
We consider the brane motion from the near-horizon region toward the spatial
infinity, which induces cosmology on the brane. As is expected, in the early
times, namely when the brane is located in the near-horizon region, the
effective cosmology on the brane coincides with that in the second
Randall-Sundrum (RS II) model. Then, the brane cosmology starts to deviate from
the RS type one since the dynamics of KK compactified dimensions becomes
significant. We find that the brane Universe cannot reach the asymptotic

coding is considered under an adversarial model. For coherent network coding,
where knowledge of the network topology and network code is assumed at the
source and destination nodes, the error correction capability of an (outer)
code is succinctly described by the rank metric; as a consequence, it is shown
that universal network error correcting codes achieving the Singleton bound can
be easily constructed and efficiently decoded. For noncoherent network coding,
where knowledge of the network topology and network code is not assumed, the
error correction capability of a (subspace) code is given exactly by a new
metric, called the injection metric, which is closely related to, but different
than, the subspace metric of K\""otter and Kschischang. In particular, in the
case of a non-constant-dimension code, the decoder associated with the
injection metric is shown to correct more errors then a
minimum-subspace-distance decoder. All of these results are based on a general
approach to adversarial error correction, which could be useful for other
adversarial channels beyond network coding.

their historical context. Until the fifties, the Italian research was only
marginally involved, if at all, in the main streams of advancement in solid
state physics. Starting from the early fifties, an interest for technical
applications of the newly introduced semiconductor devices began to grow in the
electronic engineering community. In the following years, the birth of a few
experimental and theoretical groups lead by highly motivated scientists (some
of them with international experience) allowed to deal with the main topics
related to condensed matter and semiconductor phenomena. The work developed by
these ""pioneers"", discussed in this paper, represented an invaluable
contribution for the new generations of physicists in this research field.

dark matter halos pass each other in a soliton-like way as observed in the
Bullet cluster. If not, the halos merge due to the tiny repulsive interaction
among dark matter particles as observed in the Abell 520. This idea can also
explain the origin of the dark galaxy and the galaxy without dark matter.

processes in vitro and in vivo, yet how the environment tunes their optical

calculate such properties on large scale systems, like biologically relevant
molecules in aqueous solution. Our approach is based on many body perturbation
theory combined with quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) approach. We
show here how to include quasi-particle and excitonic effects for the
calculation of optical absorption spectra in a QM/MM scheme. We apply this
scheme, together with the well established TDDFT approach, to indole in water
solution. Our calculations show that the solvent induces a redshift in the main
spectral peak of indole, in quantitative agreement with the experiments and
point to the importance of performing averages over molecular dynamics
configurations for calculating optical properties.

found only two good propagating torsion modes; they are effectively a scalar
and a pseudoscalar. Cosmology affords a natural situation where one might see
observational effects of these modes. Here we consider only the ``scalar
torsion'' mode. This mode has certain distinctive and interesting qualities. In
particular this type of torsion does not interact directly with any known
matter and it allows a critical non-zero value for the affine scalar curvature.
Via numerical evolution of the coupled nonlinear equations we show that this
mode can contribute an oscillating aspect to the expansion rate of the
Universe. From the examination of specific cases of the parameters and initial
conditions we show that for suitable ranges of the parameters the dynamic
``scalar torsion'' model can display features similar to those of the presently
observed accelerating universe.

  of Anatomical Morphometry of Brain Tissues",,,,"Technical Report KU-EC-08-2","stat.CO stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anatomical shape differences in cortical structures in the brain can be
associated with various neuropsychiatric and neuro-developmental diseases or
disorders. Labeled Cortical Distance Map (LCDM), can be a powerful tool to
quantize such morphometric differences. In this article, we investigate various
issues regarding the analysis of LCDM distances in relation to morphometry. The
length of the LCDM distance vector provides the number of voxels (approximately
a multiple of volume (in mm^3)); median, mode, range, and variance of LCDM
distances are all suggestive of size, thickness, and shape differences. However
these measures provide a crude summary based on LCDM distances which may convey
much more information about the tissue in question. To utilize more of this
information, we pool (merge) the LCDM distances from subjects in the same group
or condition. The statistical methodology we employ require normality and
within and between sample independence. We demonstrate that the violation of
these assumptions have mild influence on the tests. We specify the types of
alternatives the parametric and nonparametric tests are more sensitive for. We
also show that the pooled LCDM distances provide powerful results for group
differences in distribution, left-right morphometric asymmetry of the tissues,
and variation of LCDM distances. As an illustrative example, we use gray matter
(GM) tissue of ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) from subjects with
major depressive disorder, subjects at high risk, and control subjects. We find
significant evidence that VMPFCs of subjects with depressive disorders are
different in shape compared to those of normal subjects.
