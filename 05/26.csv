complex structure moduli space to continuously connect flux vacua. After
describing the generic features of a flux-induced potential for the complex
structure and Type IIB axio-dilaton, we specialize to the Mirror Quintic
Calabi--Yau to obtain an example landscape. Studying the cosmological dynamics
of the complex structure moduli, we find that the potential generically does
not support slow-roll inflation and that in general the landscape separates
neatly into basins of attraction of the various minima. We then discuss
tunneling, with the inclusion of gravitational effects, in many-dimensional
field spaces. A set of constraints on the form of the Euclidean paths through
field space are presented, and then applied to construct approximate instantons
mediating the transition between de Sitter vacua in the flux landscape. We find
that these instantons are generically thick-wall and that the tunneling rate is
suppressed in the large-volume limit. We also consider examples where
supersymmetry is not broken by fluxes, in which case near-BPS thin-wall bubbles
can be constructed. We calculate the bubble wall tension, finding that it
scales like a D- or NS-brane bubble, and comment on the implications of this
correspondence. Finally, we present a brief discussion of eternal inflation in
the flux-landscape.

the front propagation with a characteristic exponent $\lambda$, the front
velocity is determined by $v_f \approx 2 \beta_{\rm m}/\lambda$, where
$\beta_{\rm m} \equiv \beta(E_{\rm m})$ is the corresponding ionization
frequency. By a proper choice of the preionization profile one can achieve
front velocities $v_f$ that exceed the saturated drift velocity $v_s$ by
several orders of magnitude even in moderate electric fields. Our propagation

such a short time? We address this question using a microscopic, protein-level,
sequence-based model of humoral immune response with explicitly defined
interactions between Immunoglobulins, host and pathogen proteins. Potent
Immunoglobulins are discovered in this model via clonal selection and affinity
maturation. Possible outcomes of an infection (extinction of cells, survival
with complete elimination of viruses, or persistent infection) crucially depend
on mutation rates of viral and Immunoglobulin proteins. The model predicts that
there is an optimal Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) rate close to experimentally
observed 10-3 per nucleotide per replication. Further, we developed an
analytical theory which explains the physical reason for an optimal SHM program
as a compromise between deleterious effects of random mutations on nascent
maturing Immunoglobulins (adversity) and the need to generate diverse pool of
mutated antibodies from which highly potent ones can be drawn (diversity). The
theory explains such effects as dependence of B cell fate on affinity for an
incoming antigen, ceiling in affinity of mature antibodies, Germinal Center
sizes and maturation times. The theory reveals the molecular factors which
determine the efficiency of affinity maturation, providing insight into
variability of immune response to cytopathic (direct response by germline
antibodies) and poorly cytopathic viruses (crucial role of SHM in response).
These results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of microscopic
sequence-based models of immune system, where population dynamics of evolving
Immunoglobulins is explicitly tied to their molecular properties.

complex Legendrian subvarieties are much more rigid and have more exceptional
properties. The most remarkable case is the Legendrian subvarieties of
projective space and prior to the author's research only few smooth examples of
these were known.
  The first series of results of this thesis is related to the automorphism
group of any Legendrian subvariety in any projective contact manifold. The
connected component of this group (under suitable minor assumptions) is
completely determined by the sections of the distinguished line bundle on the
contact manifold vanishing on the Legendrian variety. Moreover its action
preserves the contact structure.
  The second series of results is devoted to finding new examples of smooth
Legendrian subvarieties of projective space. The contribution of this thesis is
in three steps: First we find an example of a smooth toric surface. Next we
find a smooth quasihomogeneous Fano 8-fold that admits a Legendrian embedding.
Finally, we realise that both of these are special cases of a very general
construction: a general hyperplane section of a smooth Legendrian variety,
after a suitable projection, is a smooth Legendrian variety of smaller
dimension. By applying this result to known examples and decomposable
Legendrian varieties, we construct infinitely many new examples in every

other invariants.

is to differentiate the explicit dependence of the line on the endpoint. The
other method is a functional derivative and corresponds in a limiting case to
the Mandelstam derivative. We also show that the only path that can be used in
the Wilson line integral that leaves the unparticle action both Poincare and
scale invariant is the straight line.

concepts and their combinations carry and influence meaning and what this
implies for human thought. More specifically, we examine the use of the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics as a modeling instrument and
propose a general mathematical modeling scheme for the combinations of
concepts. We point out that quantum mechanical principles, such as
superposition and interference, are at the origin of specific effects in
cognition related to concept combinations, such as the guppy effect and the
overextension and underextension of membership weights of items. We work out a
concrete quantum mechanical model for a large set of experimental data of
membership weights with overextension and underextension of items with respect
to the conjunction and disjunction of pairs of concepts, and show that no
classical model is possible for these data. We put forward an explanation by
linking the presence of quantum aspects that model concept combinations to the
basic process of concept formation. We investigate the implications of our
quantum modeling scheme for the structure of human thought, and show the
presence of a two-layer structure consisting of a classical logical layer and a
quantum conceptual layer. We consider connections between our findings and
phenomena such as the disjunction effect and the conjunction fallacy in
decision theory, violations of the sure thing principle, and the Allais and
Elsberg paradoxes in economics.

change threaten to destabilize key planetary carbon pools, especially the
Earth's forests which link the micro-ecology of insect infestation to climate.
To the extent mean temperature increases, insect populations accelerate
deforestation. This alters climate via the loss of active carbon sequestration
by live trees and increased carbon release from decomposing dead trees. A
positive feedback loop can emerge that is self-sustaining--no longer requiring
independent climate-change drivers. Current research regimes and insect control
strategies are insufficient at present to cope with the present regional scale
of insect-caused deforestation, let alone its likely future global scale.
Extensive field recordings demonstrate that bioacoustic communication plays a
role in infestation dynamics and is likely to be a critical link in the
feedback loop. These results open the way to novel detection and monitoring
strategies and nontoxic control interventions.

progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In the model, a carbon-oxygen white
dwarf (CO WD) accretes hydrogen-rich material from an unevolved or a slightly
evolved non-degenerate companion to increase its mass to Chandrasekhar mass
limit. Incorporating the prescription of \cite{HAC99a} for the accretion
efficiency into Eggleton's stellar evolution code and assuming that the
prescription is valid for all metallicities, we performed binary stellar
evolution calculations for more than 25,000 close WD binary systems with
various metallicities. The initial parameter spaces for SNe Ia are presented in
an orbital period-secondary mass ($\log P_{\rm i}, M_{\rm 2}^{\rm i}$) plane
for each $Z$.
  Adopting the results above, we studied the birth rate of SNe Ia for various
$Z$ via binary population synthesis. From the study, we see that for a high
$Z$, SNe Ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birth rate is
larger if a single starburst is assumed. The Galactic birth rate from the
channel is lower than (but comparable to) that inferred from observations.
  We also showed the distributions of the parameters of the binary systems at
the moment of supernova explosion and the distributions of the properties of
companions after supernova explosion. The former provides physics input to
simulate the interaction between supernova ejecta and its companion, and the
latter is helpful to search for the companions in supernova remnants.

Ignoring back reaction effects may lead one to conclude that the incident wave
may overspin the black hole, thereby exposing its inner singularity to distant

radial momentum term $p_{r}^{2}$ in polar coordinates is replaced by the
operator $\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{r} \hat{P}_{r}$, where the operator $\hat{P}_{r}$
is not hermitian in general. This fact has important implications for the path
integral and semi-classical approximations. When one defines a formal hermitian
radial momentum operator $\hat{p}_{r}=(1/2)((\frac{\hat{\vec{x}}}{r})
\hat{\vec{p}}+\hat{\vec{p}}(\frac{\hat{\vec{x}}}{r}))$, the relation
$\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{r}
\hat{P}_{r}=\hat{p}_{r}^{2}+\hbar^{2}(d-1)(d-3)/(4r^{2})$ holds in
$d$-dimensional space and this extra potential appears in the path integral
formulated in polar coordinates. The extra potential, which influences the
classical solutions in the semi-classical treatment such as in the analysis of
solitons and collective modes, vanishes for $d=3$ and attractive for $d=2$ and
repulsive for all other cases $d\geq 4$. This extra term induced by the
non-hermitian operator is a purely quantum effect, and it is somewhat analogous
to the quantum anomaly in chiral gauge theory.

All the stars were found to be flaring frequently and altogether a total of

changes during the flares by using colour-colour diagram and by detailed

decay of the X-ray light curves, and time evolution of the plasma temperature

near-field of the aperture, strongly localized electromagnetic fields are
effectively coupled to the aperture with a radius that is twenty times smaller
than the resonance wavelength. We obtained 740-fold transmission enhancement by
exciting the electric resonance of SRR. A different coupling mechanism, through
the magnetic resonance of SRR, is also verified to yield enhanced transmission.
Good agreement is obtained between the microwave measurements and numerical

lasted for ~30s. More than 40 bursts were detected both by BAT and by XRT,
seven of which are rare intermediate flares (IFs): several times 10^{42} ergs
were released. The BAT data were used to carry out time-resolved spectroscopy
in the 14-100keV range down to 8ms timescales.
  This unique dataset allowed us to test the magnetar model predictions such as
the magnetically trapped fireball and the twisted magnetosphere over an
unprecedented range of fluxes and with large statistics (in terms of both
photons and IFs). We confirmed that a two blackbody component fits adequately
the time-resolved and integrated spectra of IFs. However, Comptonization models
give comparable good reduced chi^2. Moreover, we found: i) a change of
behavior, around ~10^{41} erg/s, above which the softer blackbody shows a sort
of saturation while the harder one still grows to a few times 10^{41} erg/s;
ii) a rather sharp correlation between temperature and radii of the blackbodies
(R^2 prop kT^{-3}), which holds for the most luminous parts of the flares
(approximately for L_{tot} > 10^{41} erg/s). Within the magnetar model, the
majority of these findings can be accounted for in terms of thermalised
emission from the E-mode and O-mode photospheres. Interestingly, the maximum
observed luminosity coming from a region of ~15km matches the magnetic
Eddington luminosity at the same radius, for a surface dipole field of ~8 x
10^{14} G (virtually equal to the one deduced from the spindown of SGR
1900+14).

range of nuclear radio-power spanning 5 orders of magnitude, to unveil the
accretion mechanism in these galaxies. We estimate the accretion rate of gas
associated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival Chandra data, to derive
the deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation.
Measuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that the
accretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency of
conversion from rest mass into jet power of ~0.012. These results strengthen
and extend the validity of the results obtained by Allen and collaborators for
9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process in
FR I radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity.
  We find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by global
differences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. A linear relation
links the jet power with the host X-ray surface brightness. This implies that a
substantial change in the jet power must be accompanied by a global change in
its ISM properties, driven for example by a major merger. This correlation
provides a simple widely applicable method to estimate the jet-power of a given
object by observing the intensity of its host X-ray emission.
  To maintain the mass flow in the jet, the fraction of gas that crosses the
Bondi radius reaching the accretion disk must be > 0.002. This implies that the
radiative efficiency of the disk must be < 0.005, an indication that accretion
in these objects occurs not only at a lower rate, but also at lower efficiency
than in standard accretion disks.

scattering peak is broadened. The part of the spin excitation dispersion seems

scattering by applying an external magnetic field large enough.

excess AC conductance of the system, defined as the difference between the AC
differential conductances at finite and zero voltage, and thus disappears for a
linear system. In the quantum regime, for temperatures much smaller than the

equal to the impurity partition noise. For the case of a weak impurity we
expand our results for the AC conductance and the noise perturbatively. In
particular, if the impurity is located in the middle of the wire or at one of

of the sensors. Alternatively, the exposure to ionizing irradiation increases
the pedestals in a more homogeneous way, this coming from the generation of
interface states at the Si/SiO2 interface supplemented by the presence of
positively charged traps in the oxides. the sensors' leakage current is then
increased. We discuss the results in view of increasing the radiation-hardness

effects associated with the exchange of density and spin fluctuations. Both
effects are found to be important and to lead to an overall quenching of the
pairing gap. This result, whose quantitative value is dependent on the
effective interaction used to generate the single-particle levels, is a
consequence of the balance between the attractive (repulsive) induced
interaction arising from the exchange of density (spin) modes, balance which in
turn is influenced by the presence of the protons and depends on the
single-particle structure of the system.

feature selection to answer questions such as: selecting signature genes which

elements such as genes, proteins, external stimuli and other elements of

perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states.
A myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions are proposed,

profile due to a depletion of charge and reduction of screening near the source

localization of the HOMO and LUMO states in different parts of the system. The
reduction in overlap, caused by localization, results in a significant
reduction in the transmission coefficient and current with increasing bias. An
atomic chain connected to two Graphene ribbons was investigated to illustrate
these effects. For a chain substituting a molecule, an even-odd effect is also

descriptions in which a single evolution equation is posed for the surface
height, we overcome (some of) them by explicitly formulating the dynamics of
the species that transport along the surface, and by coupling it to that of the
surface height proper. In this we follow recent proposals inspired by
``hydrodynamic'' descriptions of pattern formation in aeolian sand dunes and
ion-sputtered systems. From this enlarged model, and by exploiting the
time-scale separation among various dynamical processes in the system, we
derive a single height equation in which coefficients can be related to
experimental parameters. This equation generalizes those obtained by previous
continuum models and is able to account for many experimental features of
pattern formation by IBS at oblique incidence, such as the evolution of the
irradiation-induced amorphous layer, transverse ripple motion with non-uniform
velocity, ripple coarsening, onset of kinetic roughening and other.
Additionally, the dynamics of the full two-field model is compared with that of

magnetization (M), with J_C is proportional to M^2.6. The domain wall motion is
strongly influenced by the presence of local pinning centres.
