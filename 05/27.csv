are difficult to study theoretically. We consider here the steady state limit
of a single electron transistor, which is attached to ferromagnetic leads and
subjected to a finite bias voltage (V). In equilibrium (i.e., V=0), this system
undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition with a critical destruction of
the Kondo effect. We construct an exact quantum Boltzmann treatment in a
dynamical large-N limit, and determine the universal scaling functions for the
I-V characteristics covering both the linear and non-linear regimes. We also
elucidate the scaling properties of both the fluctuation-dissipation ratios and
the decoherence properties as encoded in the local spin response.

relation via the affine group representation formalism for gravity, wherein a
family of gauge-diffeomorphism invariant affine coherent states are constructed
from a fiducial state. In this article, the role of the fiducial state is
played by a regularized Gaussian peaked on densitized triad configurations

group manifold consists of points in the upper half plane, wherein each point
is labeled by two local gravitational degrees of freedom from the Yamabe

of affine coherent states constitute a set of exact solutions of the

physical interpretation analogous to a continuous plane wave energy spectrum,
where the curvature constant $k$ plays the role of the energy. This result
shows that the affine translational subgroup generates transformations in the

$\bSigma^{-1}$, or the precision matrix. We form blocks of parameters based on
each off-diagonal band of the Cholesky factor from its modified Cholesky
decomposition, and penalize each block of parameters using the $L_2$-norm
instead of individual elements. We develop a one-step estimator, and prove an
oracle property which consists of a notion of block sign-consistency and
asymptotic normality. In particular, provided the initial estimator of the
Cholesky factor is good enough and the true Cholesky has finite number of
non-zero off-diagonal bands, oracle property holds for the one-step estimator
even if $p_n \gg n$, and can even be as large as $\log p_n = o(n)$, where the
data $\y$ has mean zero and tail probability $P(|y_j| > x) \leq K\exp(-Cx^d)$,
$d > 0$, and $p_n$ is the number of variables. We also prove an operator norm
convergence result, showing the cost of dimensionality is just $\log p_n$. The
advantage of this method over banding by Bickel and Levina (2008) or nested
LASSO by Levina \emph{et al.} (2007) is that it allows for elimination of
weaker signals that precede stronger ones in the Cholesky factor. A method for
obtaining an initial estimator for the Cholesky factor is discussed, and a
gradient projection algorithm is developed for calculating the one-step

mobility of localized excitations is very poor. This is attributed to a large
separation in parameter space of the bifurcation points of the involved
stationary modes. At these points the stability of the fundamental modes is
changed and an asymmetric intermediate solution appears that connects the

applications for power-coupling devices. In certain parameter regimes, the

continuously tunable by amplitude variation (with fixed phase gradient). More

one and two dimensions by a well-controlled numerical method. The method allows
to calculate directly the probabilities of particular phases in the approximate

with the highest probabilities. Depending on the electron filling $n$ and the
magnitude of the asymmetry $t_f/t_d$ between the hopping integrals of $f$ and
$d$ electrons two different scenarios in formation of ground states are
observed. At low electron fillings ($n\leq 1/3$) the ground states are always
phase segregated in the limit of strong asymmetry ($t_d\gg t_f$). With
decreasing asymmetry the system undergoes a transition to the phase separated
state and then to the homogeneous state. For electron fillings $n>1/3 $ and
weak Coulomb interactions the ground state is homogeneous for all values of
asymmetry, while for intermediate and strong interactions the system exhibits
the same sequence of phase transitions as for $n$ small. Moreover, it is shown
that the segregated phase is significantly stabilized with increasing electron
filling, while the separated phases disappear gradually from the ground-state
phase diagrams.

phase transition is strongly reduced, by about ~30K, by increasing the internal
chemical pressure going from LaOFeAs to NdOFeAs. In contrast the
superconducting critical temperature increases from 27 K to 51 K going from

star formation properties, and gas structure and dynamics, in models of
galactic disks. We extend previous models by implementing feedback in
gravitationally bound clouds: momentum is injected at a rate proportional to
the star formation rate. This mechanical energy disperses cloud gas back into
the surrounding ISM, truncating star formation in a given cloud, and raising
the overall level of ambient turbulence. Propagating star formation can however
occur as expanding shells collide, enhancing the density and triggering new
cloud and star formation. By controlling the momentum injection per massive
star and the specific star formation rate in dense gas, we find that the
negative effects of high turbulence outweigh the positive ones, and in net
feedback reduces the fraction of dense gas and thus the overall star formation
rate. The properties of the large clouds that form are not, however, very
sensitive to feedback, with cutoff masses of a few million solar masses,
similar to observations. We find a relationship between the star formation rate
surface density and the gas surface density with a power law index ~2 for our
models with the largest dynamic range, consistent with theoretical expectations
for our model of disk flaring. We point out that the value of the
""Kennicutt-Schmidt"" index depends on the thickness of the disk. With our simple
feedback prescription (a single combined star formation event per cloud), we
find that global spiral patterns are not sustained; less correlated feedback
and smaller scale turbulence appear to be necessary for spiral patterns to
persist.

atomic level. An open problem in numerical analysis is to explain the apparent
reliability of molecular dynamics simulations. The difficulty is that
individual trajectories computed in molecular dynamics are accurate for only
short time intervals, whereas apparently reliable information can be extracted
from very long-time simulations. It has been conjectured that long molecular
dynamics trajectories have low-dimensional statistical features that accurately
approximate those of the original system. Another conjecture is that numerical
trajectories satisfy the shadowing property: that they are close over long time
intervals to exact trajectories but with different initial conditions. We prove
that these two views are actually equivalent to each other, after we suitably
modify the concept of shadowing. A key ingredient of our result is a general
theorem that allows us to take random elements of a metric space that are close
in distribution and embed them in the same probability space so that they are
close in a strong sense. This result is similar to the Strassen-Dudley Theorem
except that a mapping is provided between the two random elements. Our results
on shadowing are motivated by molecular dynamics but apply to the approximation
of any dynamical system when initial conditions are selected according to a
probability measure.

dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, which provide the strongest evidence to date
that the electron cyclotron maser instability is the dominant mechanism
producing radio emission in the magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. As has
previously been reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of
100% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected from both
dwarfs with periods of 2.84 +/- 0.01 and 3.08 +/- 0.05 hours respectively for
LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized
radio emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and brightness
temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron radiation as a source of this
radio emission. The unpolarized emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs
is also attributed to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become
depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere, possibly due to
propagations effects such as scattering. Based on available v sin i data in the
literature and rotation periods derived from the periodic radio data for the
three confirmed sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546,
LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that the rotation axes
of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular to our line of sight. This
suggests a possible geometrical selection effect due to the inherent
directivity of electron cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the
previously reported relationship between radio activity and v sin i observed
for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf LSR J1835+3259

initial results of Subaru/Suprime-Cam deep imaging observation of the SSA22
proto-cluster region at z=3.09, using a special narrow-band filter to optimally
trace Lyman continuum (LyC) from galaxies at z~3. The unique wide field-of-view
of Suprime-Cam enabled us to search for ionizing photons from 198 galaxies (73
Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and 125 Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs)) with
spectroscopically measured redshifts z~3.1. We detected LyC from 7 LBGs, as
well as from 10 LAE candidates. Some of the detected galaxies show significant
spatial offsets of LyC from non-ionizing UV emission. For some LBGs the
observed non-ionizing UV to LyC flux density ratios are smaller than values
expected from population synthesis models with a standard Salpeter initial mass
function (IMF) with moderate dust attenuation (which is suggested from the
observed UV slopes), even if we assume very transparent IGM along the
sightlines of these objects. This implies an intrinsically bluer spectral
energy distribution, e.g, that produced by a top-heavy IMF, for these LBGs. The
observed flux desity ratios of non-ionizing UV to LyC of 7 detected LBGs range
from 2.4 to 23.8 and the median is 6.6. The observed flux density ratios of the
detected LAEs are even smaller than LBGs, if they are truly at z~3.1. We find
that the median value of the flux density ratio for the deteced LBGs suggest
that their escape fractions is likely to be higher than 4%, if the LyC escape
is isotropic. The results imply that some of the LBGs in the proto-cluster at
z~3 have the escape fraction significantly higher than that of galaxies (in a
general field) at z~1 studied previously.

of the critical density at the present time, is postulated. This implies that

the pre-Main Sequence (MS) phase of a grid of metal-free stars with masses in
the range 5-600 solar mass forming in the centre of a 1e6 solar mass halo at
redhisft z=20. DM particles of the parent halo are accreted in the
proto-stellar interior by adiabatic contraction and scattering/capture
processes, reaching central densities of order 1e12 GeV/cm3 at radii of the
order of 10 AU. Energy release from annihilation reactions can effectively
counteract the gravitational collapse, in agreement with results from other
groups. We find this stalling phase (known as ""dark"" star) is transients and
lasts from 2.1e3 yr (M=600 solar mass) to 1.8e4 yr (M=9 solar mass). Later in
the evolution, DM scattering/capture rate becomes high enough that energy
deposition from annihilations significantly alters the pre-MS evolution of the
star in a way that depends on DM (i) velocity dispersion, (ii) density, (iii)
elastic scattering cross section with baryons. For our fiducial set of
parameters (10 km/s, 1e11 GeV/cm3, 1e-38 cm2) we find that the evolution of
stars of mass lower than 40 solar masses ""freezes"" on the HR diagram before
reaching the ZAMS. Stars with bigger masses manage to ignite nuclear reactions;
however, DM ""burning"" prolonges their lifetimes by a factor 2 (5) for a 600

linear index when including emission from the entire galaxy. This result may
imply that the volumetric Schmidt relation is the underlying driver behind the

recent numerical models. While the data exclude the possibility of a constant

integral equation of acoustic scattering in two dimensions. These equations
have oscillatory kernels that we represent in a basis of wave atoms, and
compress by thresholding the small coefficients to zero. This phenomenon was
perhaps first observed in 1993 by Bradie, Coifman, and Grossman, in the context
of local Fourier bases \cite{BCG}. Their results have since then been extended
in various ways. The purpose of this paper is to bridge a theoretical gap and
prove that a well-chosen fixed expansion, the nonstandard wave atom form,
provides a compression of the acoustic single and double layer potentials with
wave number $k$ as $O(k)$-by-$O(k)$ matrices with $O(k^{1+1/\infty})$
nonnegligible entries, with a constant that depends on the relative $\ell_2$
accuracy $\eps$ in an acceptable way. The argument assumes smooth, separated,
and not necessarily convex scatterers in two dimensions. The essential features
of wave atoms that enable to write this result as a theorem is a sharp
time-frequency localization that wavelet packets do not obey, and a parabolic
scaling wavelength $\sim$ (essential diameter)${}^2$. Numerical experiments
support the estimate and show that this wave atom representation may be of
interest for applications where the same scattering problem needs to be solved
for many boundary conditions, for example, the computation of radar cross

approximate continuous global symmetries. Two methods stand out, both of which
occur for local brane constructions within the LARGE volume scenario of moduli

global symmetries associated with local Calabi-Yau isometries. These symmetries
are exact in the non-compact limit and are spontaneously broken by the LARGE

symmetries are phenomenologically attractive and may allow the fermion mass
hierarchies to be connected to the electroweak hierarchy via the large volume.

composed of a compressible hyperelastic material with a non-convex strain
energy function. We aim to construct the asymptotic solutions based on an
axisymmetrical three-dimensional setting and use the results to describe the
key features (in particular, instability phenomena) observed in the experiments
by others. The difficult problem of the solution bifurcations of the governing
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) is solved through a novel
approach. By using a methodology involving coupled series-asymptotic
expansions, we derive the normal form equation of the original complicated
system of nonlinear PDE's. By writing the normal form equation into a
first-order dynamical system and with a phase-plane analysis, we manage to
deduce the global bifurcation properties and to solve the boundary-value
problem analytically. The asymptotic solutions (including post-bifurcation
solutions) in terms of integrals are obtained. The engineering stress-strain
curve plotted from the asymptotic solutions can capture the key features of the
curve measured in a few experiments (e.g., the stress drop, the stress plateau,
and the small stress valley). It appears that the asymptotic solutions obtained
shed certain light on the instability phenomena associated with phase
transitions in a cylinder, in particular the role played by the radius-length
ratio. Also, an important feature of this work is that we consider the clamped
end conditions, which are more practical but rarely used in literature for
phase transition problems.

that early type galaxies show larger central concentration. The comparison of

important factor in concentrating gas into the central regions than bars.

the resonant tunneling through ferromagnetic quantum wells is theoretically
investigated. It is shown that the carrier-mediated magnetic order in the

robust, and sustainable high-frequency current oscillations over a large window
of nominally steady bias voltages. This phenomenon could spawn a new class of
quantum electronic devices based on ferromagnetic semiconductors.

can be obtained from a category of twisted diagrams which do not necessarily
satisfy any gluing condition by inverting maps which induce homology
isomorphisms on hyper-derived inverse limits. Moreover, we given an explicit
construction of a finite set of weak generators for the derived category.
  For example, if X is projective n-space then D(X) is generated by n+1
successive twists of the structure sheaf; the present paper gives a new
homotopy-theoretic proof of this classical result.
  The approach taken uses the language of model categories, and the machinery
of Bousfield-Hirschhorn colocalisation. The first step is to characterise
colocal objects; these turn out to be homotopy sheaves in the sense that chain
complexes over different open sets agree on intersections up to
quasi-isomorphism only. In a second step it is shown that the homotopy category
of homotopy sheaves is the derived category of X.

  Doppler Formula and Poincare's expansion of space","6 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently Einstein's invariance of the phase of a plane wave (1905) has been
described as ""questionable"" (Huang). Another definition of this phase, taking
into account a ""relativistically induced optical anisotropy"" for isotropic
medium in moving, has been proposed (Gjurkinovski). We suggest (logically) to
determine this ""relativistically induced effect"" if the isotropic medium is the
vacuum. We prove that the basic Lorentz invariant, in vacuum, is not the phase
of a plane wave but the phase of a spherical wave. According to Poincare an
isotropic spherical wave is not LTed (Lorentz transformed) into an isotropic
spherical wave (Einstein 1905) but LTed into an anisotropic ellipsoidal wave
(relativity of simultaneity). Poincare's ellipsoidal wavefront (1906) is an
{equiphase} surface. The Lorenz gauge is connected with the invariance of the
phase of a spherical wave and the transverse gauge with Einstein's invariant.
We deduce from Poincare's invariant a relativistic Doppler formula which is
unseparable from Poincare's theory of expansion of space and therefore the
measurements of Hubble.

respectively. The higher Tc of the SC transition here (as compared with
conventional (LTSC) BCS-systems without (e-h)-pairing) is a natural consequence
of (e-e)-pairing at the background of high density of states which arises in
the narrow energy range near dielectric-(SDW)-gap (pseudogap) edges due to
removing of electronic states from the energy region of dielectric (SDW) gap
(pseudogap) (already formed at the part of the Fermi surface in the normal
state with onset temperature T* (near the same for corresponding structural
transition) due to (e-h)-pairing). Below Tc the system enters the coexistence
(SC+SDW) state. The SDW formed is incommensurate with lattice and dynamic in
character. The phase diagram for such system is determined: the doping
dependence of the SC gap (and Tc) has a maximum (optimal doping) while the
dielectric (SDW) gap (pseudogap) (and T*) is a decreasing function of doping.

another data for Fe-based superconductors on the basis of model with partial
dielectrization of electron energy spectra. The picture obtained and

Variance method to determine a pulsational period of 5.5675 days. A fit of
time-dependent Fourier coefficients is performed and a search for proper motion
is conducted. The light curve exhibits a previously unobserved and spectacular
change in both mean magnitude and amplitude, which has no clear theoretical
explanation. Our analysis of the spectrum implies a radial velocity of 104 km

low-metallicity environments. In both cases, model predictions are consistent
with the Swift number counts and with the number of detections at z>2.5 and
z>3.5. To discriminate between the two evolutionary scenarios, we compare the

luminosity in excess of 10^53 erg s^-1) detected by Swift in its first three

redshift determination and measured peak energy. We find that pure luminosity
evolution models can account for the number of sure identifications. In the
case of a pure density evolution scenario, models with Z_th>0.3 Zsun are ruled
out with high confidence. For lower metallicity thresholds, the model results
are still statistically consistent with available lower limits. However, many
factors can increase the discrepancy between model results and data, indicating
that some luminosity evolution in the GRB LF may be needed also for such low
values of Z_th. Finally, using these new constraints, we derive robust upper
limits on the bright-end of the GRB LF, showing that this cannot be steeper

Yang-Mills plasma at finite temperature can be computed within the AdS/CFT
correspondence, with results which are suggestive of a parton picture for the
plasma. Via successive branchings, essentially all partons cascade down to very
small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction x and to transverse momenta
smaller than the saturation momentum Q_s\sim T/x. This scale Q_s controls the
plasma interactions with a hard probe, in particular, the jet energy loss and
its transverse momentum broadening.

unambiguously detected with a mean period of 0.078828(6) days, firstly
classifying the object as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova. It also turned out that
the outburst contained a precursor. At the end of the precursor, immature
profiles of humps were observed. By a phase analysis of these humps, we
interpreted the features as superhumps. This is the second example that the
superhumps were shown during a precursor. Near the maximum stage of the
outburst, we discovered an abrupt shift of the superhump period by ${\sim}$
0.002 days. After the supermaximum, the superhump period decreased at the rate
of $\dot{P}/P$=$-8.2{\times}10^{-5}$, which is typical for SU UMa-type dwarf
novae. Although the outburst light curve was characteristic of SU UMa-type
dwarf novae, long-term monitoring of the variable shows no outbursts over the

foundation for compound Poisson approximation limit theorems (analogous to the
corresponding developments for the central limit theorem and for simple Poisson
approximation), this work examines sufficient conditions under which the
compound Poisson distribution has maximal entropy within a natural class of
probability measures on the nonnegative integers. We show that the natural
analog of the Poisson maximum entropy property remains valid if the measures
under consideration are log-concave, but that it fails in general. A parallel
maximum entropy result is established for the family of compound binomial
measures. The proofs are largely based on ideas related to the semigroup
approach introduced in recent work by Johnson for the Poisson family.
Sufficient conditions are given for compound distributions to be log-concave,
and specific examples are presented illustrating all the above results.

powerful energy carriers, thought to be fed by accretion, which produce
non-thermal emission at different energy bands. To date, several Galactic
sources showing extended radio emission, among them at least one confirmed
microquasar, Cygnus X-1, have been detected in the TeV range. All of them show
complex patterns of spectral and temporal behavior. In this work, we discuss
the physics behind the very high-energy emission in microquasars. In concrete,
we focus on the microquasar Cygnus X-1, and also in the other two TeV binaries
with detected extended outflows, LS 5039 and LS I +61 303, pointing out
relevant aspects of the complex phenomena occurring in them. We conclude that
the TeV emission is likely of leptonic origin, although hadrons cannot be
discarded. In addition, efficient electromagnetic cascades can hardly develop
since even relatively low magnetic fields suppress them. Also, the modeling of
the radiation from some of the detected sources points to them as either
extremely efficient accelerators, and/or having the TeV emitter at a distance
from the compact object of about 10e12 cm. Finally, we point out that the role
of a massive and hot stellar companion, due to its strong photon field and
wind, cannot be neglected when trying to understand the behavior of
microquasars at high and very high energies. The complexity of microquasars
precludes straightforward generalizations to a whole population, and are better
studied presently in a source by source base.

local to the binary, which has been suggested as a possible spectral signature
of Neon rich degenerate companions. XMM-Newton observed the source twice, in
2006 September and October. High resolution spectroscopy with the RGS was used
to estimate the ratio of the neutral neon to oxygen column densities to search
for an anomalous Ne abundance in this X-ray binary. We find no evidence for
anomalous Ne/O ratios, finding Ne/O=0.18+/-0.06 and Ne/O=0.17+/-0.03 (1 sigma
uncertainties), in the two observations, respectively. These values are
consistent with that in the interstellar medium. Timing analysis of EPIC data
suggests possible periodicities at 9170+/-235 s and 18616 +/- 531 s, which need
confirmation. A by-product of these observations consists of the spatial
analysis of the source field, which resulted in the detection of 46 faint

\emph{network-based inference} (NBI), which has higher accuracy than the
classical algorithm, namely \emph{collaborative filtering}. In the NBI, the
correlation resulting from a specific attribute may be repeatedly counted in
the cumulative recommendations from different objects. By considering the
higher order correlations, we design an improved algorithm that can, to some
extent, eliminate the redundant correlations. We test our algorithm on two
benchmark data sets, \emph{MovieLens} and \emph{Netflix}. Compared with the
NBI, the algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, can be further
improved by 23% for \emph{MovieLens} and 22% for \emph{Netflix}, respectively.
The present algorithm can even outperform the \emph{Latent Dirichlet
Allocation} algorithm, which requires much longer computational time.
Furthermore, most of the previous studies considered the algorithmic accuracy
only, in this paper, we argue that the diversity and popularity, as two
significant criteria of algorithmic performance, should also be taken into
account. With more or less the same accuracy, an algorithm giving higher
diversity and lower popularity is more favorable. Numerical results show that
the present algorithm can outperform the standard one simultaneously in all
five adopted metrics: lower ranking score and higher precision for accuracy,
larger Hamming distance and lower intra-similarity for diversity, as well as
smaller average degree for popularity.

explanation of a transition from regular to irregular motions and more
generally of the nature of a certain kind of deterministic chaos. To this end
we introduced a simple model analogous to a three-body problem in the plane,
whose general solution is obtained via quadratures all performed in terms of
elementary functions. For some values of the coupling constants the system is
isochronous and explicit formulas for the period of the solutions can be given.
For other values, the motions are confined but feature aperiodic (in some sense
chaotic) motions.
  This rich phenomenology can be understood in remarkable, quantitative detail
in terms of travel on a certain (circular) path on the Riemann surfaces defined
by the solutions of a related model considered as functions of a complex time.
This model is meant to provide a paradigmatic first step towards a somewhat
novel understanding of a certain kind of chaotic phenomena.

by this fact, we introduce the Poisson cloning model $G_{PC} (n,p)$ for random

Then, we first establish a theorem that shows the new model is equivalent to

cut-off line algorithm enables us to very precisely analyze the sizes of the
largest component and the $t$-core of $G(n,p)$. This new approach to the
problems yields not only elegant proofs but also improved bounds that are
essentially best possible. We also consider the Poisson cloning models for
random hypergraphs and random $k$-SAT problems. Then, the $t$-core problem for

posit the existence of ""dark energy""--a mysterious energy field that permeates

modern cosmology. After describing the scientific background in depth, we
formulate the task as a nonlinear inverse problem that expresses the comoving
distance function in terms of the dark-energy equation of state. We present two
classes of methods for making sharp statistical inferences about the equation
of state from observations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe). First, we derive a
technique for testing hypotheses about the equation of state that requires no
assumptions about its form and can distinguish among competing theories.
Second, we present a framework for computing parametric and nonparametric
estimators of the equation of state, with an associated assessment of
uncertainty. Using our approach, we evaluate the strength of statistical
evidence for various competing models of dark energy. Consistent with current
studies, we find that with the available Type Ia SNe data, it is not possible
to distinguish statistically among popular dark-energy models, and that, in
particular, there is no support in the data for rejecting a cosmological
constant. With much more supernova data likely to be available in coming years
(e.g., from the DOE/NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission), we address the more
interesting question of whether future data sets will have sufficient
resolution to distinguish among competing theories.

geometric queries in optimal time. Our first and main result is a succinct
geometric index that can answer point location queries, a fundamental problem
in computational geometry, on planar triangulations in O(lg n) time. We also
design three variants of this index. The first supports point location using
$\lg n + 2\sqrt{\lg n} + O(\lg^{1/4} n)$ point-line comparisons. The second
supports point location in o(lg n) time when the coordinates are integers
bounded by U. The last variant can answer point location in O(H+1) expected
time, where H is the entropy of the query distribution. These results match the
query efficiency of previous point location structures that use O(n) words or
O(n lg n) bits, while saving drastic amounts of space.

design indexes for other types of queries. Finally, we apply our techniques to

be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production. The inverse slope parameter
Teff associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the
rho, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise, coupled to a
hierarchy in hadron freeze-out, points to radial flow of a hadronic decay
source, the decline above signals a transition to a low-flow source, presumably
of partonic origin. The mass spectra show at low transverse momenta the steep
rise towards low masses characteristic for Planck-like radiation. The
polarization of the excess referred to the Collins Soper frame is found to be
isotropic. All observations are consistent with the interpretation of the
excess as thermal radiation.

including the recoilless part can be derived in a frequency modulation
approach. The nue lines of natural width in 3H to 3He 2-body beta-decay can
then be resonantly captured with geometrical cross section. The extreme

we observe a substantial transfer probability even at energies below the

an increase in the rate of dark pulses and the loss of uniformity in the pixel
gains. Higher radiation doses reduced also the photon detection efficiency. The
results are especially relevant for applications of SiPM in fibre detectors at

model of low-scale electroweak (EW) hybrid inflation. We show how the
inhomogeneities in the Higgs field, resulting from tachyonic preheating after
inflation, seed the magnetic fields in a way analogous to that predicted by
Vachaspati and Cornwall in the context of the EW symmetry breaking. At this
stage, the helical nature of the generated magnetic fields is linked to the
non-trivial winding of the Higgs-field. We analyze non-perturbatively the
evolution of these helical seeds through the highly non-linear stages of
symmetry breaking (SB) and beyond. Electroweak SB occurs via the nucleation and
growth of Higgs bubbles which squeeze the magnetic fields into string-like
structures. The W-boson charge density clusters in lumps around the magnetic
strings. After symmetry breaking, a detailed analysis of the magnetic field
Fourier spectrum shows two well differentiated components: a UV radiation tail
at a temperature T ~ 0.23 m_higgs slowly growing with time, and an IR peak
associated to the helical magnetic fields, which seems to follow inverse
cascade. The system enters a regime in which we observe that both the amplitude
(\rho_B/\rho_{EW} ~ 0.01) and the correlation length of the magnetic field grow
linearly with time. During this stage of evolution we also observe a power-law
growth in the helical susceptibility. These properties support the possibility
that our scenario could provide the seeds eventually evolving into the
microgauss fields observed today in galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
