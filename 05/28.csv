Quantum Paraelectrics near quantum critical point. From a microscopic theory we
first show that near the critical point the transition temperature $T_c(p)$
varies as $ (1-p/p_c)^\xi$ with $\xi={1/2}$. Within the Landau scheme, it is
shown that for $\xi \leq 1$, a condition satisfied by most quantum
paraelectrics the transition is inevitably first order in nature. The present
analysis is valid for non-polar impurity induced transitions in these materials
and is supported by some recent experiment.

access to it both by simple physical occlusion and by providing the substrate
for numerous covalent epigenetic tags. While nucleosome positions in vitro are
determined by sequence alone, in vivo competition with other DNA-binding
factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes play a role that needs to be
quantified. We developed a biophysical model for the sequence dependence of DNA
bending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free
energies of nucleosome formation and a nucleosome crystal structure; we also
successfully designed both strong and poor histone binding sequences ab initio.
For in vivo data from S.cerevisiae, the strongest positioning signal came from
the competition with other factors. Based on sequence alone, our model predicts
that functional transcription factor binding sites have a tendency to be
covered by nucleosomes, but are uncovered in vivo because functional sites
cluster within a single nucleosome footprint, making transcription factors bind
cooperatively. Similarly a weak enhancement of nucleosome binding in the TATA
region for naked DNA becomes a strong depletion when the TATA-binding protein
is included, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Predictions at specific
loci were also greatly enhanced by including competing factors. Our physically
grounded model distinguishes multiple ways in which genomic sequence can
influence nucleosome positions and thus provides an alternative explanation for
several important experimental findings.

as a power law: phi(t;k)~k/(1+kt)^(1+beta), 0<beta<1. The parameter k, which is
the diffusion coefficient for the jump, is a random quantity also; in each
jump, it is drawn from a PDF, p(k)~1/k^gamma (0<gamma<1). We show that this
system exhibits a transition in the scaling law of its effective WT-PDF,
psi(t), which is obtained when averaging phi(t;k) with p(k). psi(t) decays as a
power law, psi(t)~1/t^(1+mu), and mu is given by two different formula. When
1-gamma> beta;, mu=beta, but when 1-gamma<beta, mu=1-gamma. The transition in
the scaling of psi(t) reflects the competition between two different mechanisms
for subdiffusion: subdiffusion due to the heavily tailed phi(t;k) for
microscopic jumps, and subdiffusion due to the collective effect of an
environment made of many slow local regions. These two different mechanisms for
subdiffusion are not additive, and compete each other. The reported transition
is dimension independent, and disappears when the power beta is also

to increase the absorption depth of the storage material, in contrast to
previously known quantum memories. Efficient readout is possible thanks to
rephasing of the atomic dipoles due to the AFC structure. Long-time storage and

a 2-letter alphabet. They are also the balanced sequences over a 2-letter
alphabet and the sequences describing discrete lines. They are famous and have
been extensively studied since the 18th century. One of the {extensions} of
these sequences over a $k$-letter alphabet, with $k\geq 3$, are the episturmian
sequences, which generalizes a construction of Sturmian sequences using the
palindromic closure operation. There exists a finite version of the Sturmian
sequences called the Christoffel words. They are known since the works of
Christoffel and have interested many mathematicians. In this paper, we
introduce a generalization of Christoffel words for an alphabet with 3 letters
or more, using the episturmian morphisms. We call them the {\it epichristoffel
words}. We define this new class of finite words and show how some of the
properties of the Christoffel words can be generalized naturally or not for
this class.

the question recently posed in Fluctuation and Noise Letters (December 2007),
if there is and interaction between bodies with correlated information content,
and weather the observed weight transients during/after changing the
information content in memory devices is due to a new type of interaction, a
new type of ""fifth force"", or it is only a classical mechanism. We briefly
discuss the issue of the great experimental uncertainty of the Newtonian
gravitation constant. We also mention the peculiar experiments about sudden
weight changes of humans and animals at the moment of death. The extended
monitoring of four 4GB flash drives with no casing and various information
content indicate a significant correlation between their weight variations and
the fluctuations of ambient humidity. This is an evidence for the role of
humidity and hygroscopic components, at least, for long-term weight
fluctuations. A sequence of information changing experiments with such a flash
drives at stable humidity conditions shows a significant variability of the
transients of the absolute mass with some dependence on the information
content. Finally, a related new experiment was carried out with olive oil and
chilli pepper powder that was dissolved in it while the mass variations were
recorded and a positive mass transient of 0.3 milligram was observed for about
10 minutes. The process represents the writing of new random information into a
medium. The only classical interpretation of this mechanism would be the
compression of trapped air between the grains by the surface tension of the
oil, or that of in pores by capillary forces, and the resulting decrease of the
Archimedes force due volume reduction.

automatically has an Sp(4) = SO(5) internal symmetry. The free theory has
resistivity linear in temperature. The interacting theory has a low-energy
interacting fixed point and is thus a non-Landau/Fermi liquid.
Anti-ferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) order parameters are bilinears
in the fields and form the 5-dimensional vector representation of SO(5). An AF
phase occurs at low doping which terminates in a first order transition. We
incorporate momentum dependent scattering of Cooper pairs near the Fermi
surface to 1-loop and derive a new kind of SC gap equation beyond mean field
with a d-wave gap solution. Taking into account the renormalization group (RG)
scaling properties near the low energy fixed point, we calculate the complete
phase diagram as a function of doping, which shows some universal geometric
features. The d-wave SC dome terminates on the over-doped side at the fixed
point of the RG,which is a quantum critical point. Optimal doping is estimated
to occur just below 3/2\pi^2. The critical temperature for SC at optimal doping
is set mainly by the universal nodal Fermi velocity and lattice spacing, and is
estimated to average around 140K for LSCO. The pseudogap energy scale is
identified as the RG scale of the coupling.

detection is not surprising: the estimated probability of finding a single z>6

field, called dilaton
\cite{Heide:1993yz,Carter:1995zi,Carter:1996rf,Carter:1997fn}. We provide a
phase diagram describing the restoration of chiral and scale symmetries. We
show that chiral symmetry is restored at large temperatures, but at low
temperatures it remains broken at all densities. We also show that scale
invariance is more easily restored at low rather than large baryon densities.
The masses of vector mesons scale with the value of the dilaton and their
values initially slightly decrease with the density but then they increase
again for densities larger than $\sim 3 \rho_0$. The pion mass increases
continuously with the density and at $\rho_0$ and T=0 its value is $\sim$ 30
MeV larger than in the vacuum. We show that the model is compatible with the
bounds stemming from astrophysics, as e.g. the one associated with the maximum
mass of a neutron star. The most striking feature of the model is a very
significant softening at large densities, which manifests also as a strong
reduction of the adiabatic index. While the softening has probably no
consequence for Supernova explosion via the direct mechanism, it could modify

binary-black-hole initial data, focusing on their ability to generate black
holes with nearly-extremal spins: (i) Bowen-York initial data, including
standard puncture data (based on conformal flatness and Bowen-York extrinsic
curvature), (ii) standard quasi-equilibrium initial data (based on the
extended-conformal-thin-sandwich equations, conformal flatness, and maximal
slicing), and (iii) quasi-equilibrium data based on the superposition of
Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the two conformally-flat methods (i) and (ii)
perform similarly, with spins up to about 0.99 obtainable at the initial time.
However, in an evolution, we expect the spin to quickly relax to a
significantly smaller value around 0.93 as the initial geometry relaxes. For
quasi-equilibrium superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) data [method (iii)], we
construct initial data with \emph{initial} spins as large as 0.9997. We evolve
SKS data sets with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find that the spin drops by only
a few parts in 10^4 during the initial relaxation; therefore, we expect that
SKS initial data will allow evolutions of binary black holes with relaxed spins
above 0.99. [Abstract abbreviated; full abstract also mentions several

three-dimensional torus model for the expanding radio shell, in which the
emission is confined to an inclined equatorial belt; our model also
incorporates both a correction for light travel-time effects and an overall
east-west gradient in the radio emissivity. By deriving an analytic expression
for the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the projected three-dimensional
brightness distribution, we can fit our spatial model directly to the
interferometric visibility data. This provides robust estimates to the radio
morphology at each epoch. The best-fit results suggest a constant remnant
expansion at 4000 +/- 400 km/s over the 16-year period covered by the
observations. The model fits also indicate substantial mid-latitude emission,
extending to 40 degree on either side of the equatorial plane. This likely
corresponds to the extra-planar structure seen in H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$
emission from the supernova reverse shock, and broadly supports hydrodynamic
models in which the complex circumstellar environment was produced by a
progression of interacting winds from the progenitor. Our model quantifies the
clear asymmetry seen in the radio images: we find that the eastern half of the
radio remnant is consistently ~40 brighter than the western half at all epochs,
which may result from an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution between these two
hemispheres.

array, we create maps unusually sensitive to faint (few mJy per beam) extended
(approx. 5 arcmin) thermal dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm wavelength.
Complementary information on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and
2MASS. RESULTS: Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize
extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact intensity peaks in our
data separately to pay attention to this complexity. We derive, e.g., sizes,
masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as column densities and
related properties for the peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then
enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and temperatures, as well as
envelope masses, for the young embedded stars. CONCLUSIONS: (abridged) Starless
and star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in many core properties;
a picture of dense core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively
form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g., mass, density, or both,
is inconsistent with our data. Comparison of various evolutionary indicators
for young stellar objects in our sample (e.g., bolometric temperatures) reveals
inconsistencies between some of them, possibly suggesting a revision of some of
these indicators.

similar to disk galaxies) and classical bulges (bulges which appear similar to

bulge Sersic indices is bimodal, and this bimodality correlates with the
morphology of the bulge. Pseudobulges have n<2 and classical bulges have n>2
with little overlap. Also, pseudobulges do not follow the correlations of
Sersic index with structural parameters or the photometric projections of the
fundamental plane in the same way as classical bulges and elliptical galaxies
do. We find that pseudobulges are systematically flatter than classical bulges
and thus more disk-like in both their morphology and shape. We do not find
significant differences between different bulge morphologies that we are
collectively calling pseudobulges (nuclear spirals, nuclear rings, nuclear
bars, and nuclear patchiness) appear to behave similarly in all parameter
correlations. In Sersic index, flattening, and bulge-to-total ratio, the
distinction appears to be between classical bulges and pseudobulges, not
between different pseudobulge morphologies. The Sersic index of the
pseudobulges does not correlate with B/T, in contrast to classical bulges.
Also, the half-light radius of the pseudobulge correlates with the scale length
of the disk; this is not the case for classical bulges. The correlation of
Sersic index and scale lengths with bulge morphology suggests that secular
evolution is creating pseudobulges with low-Sersic index, and that other
processes (e.g. major mergers) are responsible for the higher Sersic index in
classical bulges and elliptical galaxies.

and used to provide an approximation of the ergodic partition of the phase
space. We term the graphical representation of this approximation - based on
time averages of observables - a Mesochronic Plot (from Greek: \textit{meso} -
mean, \textit{chronos} - time}. The method is useful for identifying
low-dimensional projections (e.g. two-dimensional slices) of invariant
structures in phase spaces of dimensionality bigger than two. We also introduce
the concept of the ergodic quotient space, obtained by assigning a point to
every ergodic set, and provide an embedding method whose graphical
representation we call the Mesochronic Scatter Plot (MSP). We use the Chirikov
standard map as a well-known and dynamically rich example in order to
illustrate the implementation of our methods. In addition, we expose
applications to other higher dimensional maps such as the Fro\'eschle map for
which we utilize our methods to analyze merging of resonances and, the
three-dimensional Extended standard map for which we study the conjecture on
its ergodicity [3]. We extend the study in our next paper [4] by investigating
the visualization of periodic sets using harmonic time averages. Both of these

knowledge, no NN algorithm that learns either Kalman prediction or Kalman

optimal Kalman prediction and control (KPC), as well as system identification,

  The requirements of KPC appear to impose significant constraints on the

constraints bears certain resemblances to the local-circuit architecture of
mammalian cerebral cortex. We discuss these resemblances, as well as caveats
that limit our current ability to draw inferences for biological function. It
has been suggested that the local cortical circuit (LCC) architecture may
perform core functions (as yet unknown) that underlie sensory, motor,and other
cortical processing. It is reasonable to conjecture that such functions may
include prediction, the estimation or inference of missing or noisy sensory
data, and the goal-driven generation of control signals. The resemblances found
between the KPC NN architecture and that of the LCC are consistent with this

repeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the
network performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such
networks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on
them. This problem is sometimes known as {\em the curse of the boundary nodes}.
To overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in
which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone
nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing
to forward the boundary nodes' packets. Here, the concept of core is used to
study the stability of the coalitions in such games. Then three types of
fairness are investigated, namely, min-max fairness using nucleolus, average
fairness using the Shapley function, and a newly proposed market fairness.
Based on the specific problem addressed in this paper, market fairness is a new
fairness concept involving fairness between multiple backbone nodes and
multiple boundary nodes. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated
games and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and
backbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria. The
proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about 50%, compared
with pure repeated game schemes.

almost a singlet, and corresponds to those Fe nuclei, which have two oxygen

corresponds to Fe nuclei, which have vacancies in their immediate neighborhood.
The spectrum at 95 K, exhibits a broadened magnetic split major (84%)

relative intensities of the subspectra facilitate in estimating the actual

the energy of the spin-orbit splitting $\Delta$. These resonances originate in
the intersubband transitions between spin-split subbands. Such resonances can
be observed in the frequency dependence of the surface impedance. Plasmons in
thin metal films are gapless and can be strongly affected by these spin
resonances, acquiring significant modification of the spectrum when it
intersects the $\omega=\Delta$ line. Finally, an interesting demonstration of
the intersubband resonances can be obtained when metal films are coated with
ionic dielectrics that have a frequency of longitudinal/transverse optical
phonons above/below $\Delta$. The dielectric function between the two optical
phonon frequencies is negative which forbids propagation of conventional

transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and
torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and
the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the
geometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the
long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by
velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the
blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the
inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the
outer accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the
scattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so
high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as
is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass
estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line
region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a
similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad
absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from
the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering
for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh
scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line
profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.

of a pulsar with an orbiting planet is derived for the case in which the orbits
of the moon and the planet-moon barycenter are both circular and coplanar. The
signal consists of two sinusoids with frequency (2n_p - 3n_b) and (2n_p - n_b
), where n_p and n_b are the mean motions of the planet and moon around their
barycenter, and the planet-moon system around the host, respectively. The
amplitude of the signal is equal to the fraction sin I[9(M_p M_m)/16(M_p +
M_m)^2] [r/R]^5 of the system crossing time R/c, where M_p and M_m are the the
masses of the planet and moon, r is their orbital separation, R is the distance
between the host pulsar and planet-moon barycenter, I is the inclination of the
orbital plane of the planet, and c is the speed of light. The analysis is
applied to the case of PSR B1620-26 b, a pulsar planet, to constrain the
orbital separation and mass of any possible moons. We find that a stable moon
orbiting this pulsar planet could be detected, if the moon had a separation of
about one fiftieth of that of the orbit of the planet around the pulsar, and a
mass ratio to the planet of ~5% or larger.

We use the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to derive the luminosity function
(LF) of the first-ranked (brightest) group/cluster galaxies, the LF of
second-ranked, satellite and isolated galaxies, and the LF of groups of
galaxies.
  Methods. We investigate the LFs of different samples in various environments:
in voids, filaments, superclusters and supercluster cores. We compare the
derived LFs with the Schechter and double-power-law analytical expressions. We
also analyze the luminosities of isolated galaxies.
  Results. We find strong environmental dependency of luminosity functions of
all populations. The luminosities of first-ranked galaxies have a lower limit,
depending on the global environment (higher in supercluster cores, and absent
in voids). The LF of second-ranked galaxies in high-density regions is similar
to the LF of first-ranked galaxies in a lower-density environment. The
brightest isolated galaxies can be identified with first-ranked galaxies at
distances where the remaining galaxies lie outside the observational window
used in the survey.
  Conclusions. The galaxy and cluster LFs can be well approximated by a
double-power-law; the widely used Schechter function does not describe well the
bright end and the bend of the LFs. Properties of the LFs reflect differences
in the evolution of galaxies and their groups in different environments.

of curvature perturbations. We introduce a vector field which has a non-minimal
kinetic term and couples with a waterfall field in hybrid inflation model. In
such a system, the vector field gives fluctuations of the end of inflation and
hence induces a subcomponent of curvature perturbations. Since the vector has a
preferred direction, the statistical anisotropy could appear in the
fluctuations. We present the explicit formula for the statistical anisotropy in
the primordial power spectrum and the bispectrum of curvature perturbations.
Interestingly, there is the possibility that the statistical anisotropy does
not appear in the power spectrum but does appear in the bispectrum. We also
find that the statistical anisotropy provides the shape dependence to the
bispectrum.

using a vector magnetograph and a H-alpha Lyot filtergraph with Domeless Solar
Telescope at Hida Observatory on October 22, 2006. In H-alpha wing images, we
could see many Ellerman bombs (EBs) in the EFR. Two observation modes, slit
scan and slit fixed, were performed with the vector magnetograph, along with
H-alpha filtergraph. Using H-alpha wing images, we detected 12 EBs during slit
scan observation period and 9 EBs during slit fixed observation period. With
slit scan observation, we found that all the EBs were distributed in the area
where the spatial gradient of vertical field intensity was large, which
indicates the possibility of rapid topological change in magnetic field in the
area of EBs. With slit fixed observation, we found that EBs were distributed in
the areas of undulatory magnetic fields, both in vertical and horizontal
components. This paper is the first to report the undulatory pattern in
horizontal components of magnetic field, which is also evidence for emerging
magnetic flux by Parker instability. These results allow us to confirm the
association between EBs and emerging flux tubes. Three triggering mechanism of
EBs is discussed with respect to emerging flux tubes: 9 out of 21 EBs occurred
at the footpoints of emerging flux tubes, 8 out of 21 EBs occurred at the top
of emerging flux tubes, and 4 out of 21 EBs occurred at unipolar region. Each
case can be explained by magnetic reconnection in the low chromosphere.

films, formed between neighboring bubbles/drops in the shear flow. The model
predicts that the viscous stress in these systems should be a proportional to
Ca^1/2, where Ca is the capillary number and n = 1/2 is the power-law index. In
the current paper we explain in detail our model and develop it further in
several aspects: First, we extend the model to account for the effects of
viscous friction in the curved meniscus regions, surrounding the planar films,
on the dynamics of film formation and on the total viscous stress. Second, we
consider the effects of surface forces (electrostatic, van der Waals, etc.)
acting between the surfaces of the neighboring bubbles/drops and show that
these forces could be important in emulsions, due to the relatively small
thickness of emulsion films (often comparable to the range of action of the
surface forces). Third, additional consideration is made for bubbles/drops
exhibiting high surface viscosity, for which we demonstrate an additional
contribution to the macroscopic viscous stress, created by the surface
dissipation of energy. The new upgraded model predicts that the energy
dissipation at the bubble/drop surface leads to power-law index n < 1/2,
whereas the contribution of the surface forces leads to n > 1/2, which explains
the rich variety of foam/emulsion behaviors observed upon steady shear. Various
comparisons are made between model predictions and experimental results for
both foams and emulsions, and a very good agreement is found.

source with low velocity must be super-fast magnetosonic before passing through
the event horizon. We work out and apply a trans-fast magnetosonic solution
without the detailed analysis of the regularity conditions at the magnetosonic
point, by introducing the bending angle $\beta$ of magnetic field line, which
is the ratio of the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field. To
accrete onto a black hole, the trans-magnetosonic solution has some
restrictions on $\beta$, which are related to the field-aligned parameters of
the MHD flows. One of the restrictions gives the boundary condition at the
event horizon for the inclination of a magnetic field line. We find that this
inclination is related to the energy and angular momentum transport to the
black hole. Then, we discuss the spin-up/down process of a rotating black hole
by cold MHD inflows in a secular evolution timescale. There are two asymptotic
states for the spin evolution. One is that the angular velocity of the black
hole approaches to that of the magnetic field line, and the other is that the
spin-up effect by the positive angular momentum influx and the spin-down effect
by the energy influx (as the mass-energy influx) are canceled. We also show

In this
paper, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a

of perfect hash functions if for every $S \subseteq [n]$, $|S|=k$, the number
of functions that are 1-1 on $S$ is between $T/\delta$ and $\delta T$ for some
constant $T>0$. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions
requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on $S$, for each
$S$ of size $k$. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number
of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking $\delta$ to be close to 1) for
every such $S$. Our main result is that for any constant $\delta > 1$, a
$\delta$-balanced $(n,k)$-family of perfect hash functions of size $2^{O(k \log

devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In
particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for
approximating both the number of simple paths of length $k$ and the number of
simple cycles of size $k$ for any $k \leq O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log \log n})$

average energy of the system for various values of the transverse field at
different temperatures. The antiferromagnetic order is seen to get immediately
broken as soon as the thermal or quantum fluctuations are added. We also
discuss the phase diagram for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with the
same LRIAF bias, also in presence of a transverse field. We find that while the
antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken as one adds an infinitesimal
transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the system, an infinitesimal SK spin
glass disorder is enough to induce a stable glass order in the antiferromagnet.
This glass order eventually gets destroyed as the thermal or quantum
fluctuations increased beyond their threshold values and the transition to para
phase occurs. Indications of this novel phase transition are discussed. Because
of the presence of full frustration, this surrogate property of the LRIAF for
incubation of stable spin glass phase in it (induced by addition of a small
disorder) should enable eventually the study of classical and quantum spin
glass phases by using some perturbation theory with respect to the disorder.

frequency gravitational waves in the band $10^{-5} - 1$ Hz. In order to attain
the requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be
suppressed below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise,
acceleration noise etc. This is achieved by combining time-delayed data for
which precise knowledge of time-delays is required. The gravitational field,
mainly that of the Sun and the motion of LISA affect the time-delays and the

the orbits of spacecraft is included. This leads to additional flexing over and
above that of the Sun. We have written a numerical code which computes the
optical links, that is, the time-delays with great accuracy $\sim 10^{-2}$
metres - more than what is required for time delay interferometry (TDI) - for
most of the orbit and with sufficient accuracy within $\sim 10$ metres for an
integrated time window of about six days, when one of the arms tends to be
tangent to the orbit. Our analysis of the optical links is fully general
relativistic and the numerical code takes into account effects such as the
Sagnac, Shapiro delay, etc.. We show that with the deemed parameters in the
design of LISA, there are symmetries inherent in the configuration of LISA and
in the physics, which may be used effectively to suppress the residual laser
noise in the modified first generation TDI. We demonstrate our results for some

R- and D- errors. Further, I compare how the two approaches can justify the
R-D-error correlation, focusing on the advantages of the Q-cell approach. The
positive role of environmentally induced decoherence (EID) on both steps of the
adaptation process is emphasized. A starving bacterial cell is proposed to be
in an einselected state. The intracellular dynamics in this state has a unitary
character and I propose to interpret it as 'exponential growth in imaginary
time', analogously to the commonly considered 'diffusion' interpretation of the
Schroedinger equation. Addition of a substrate leads to Wick rotation and a
switch from 'imaginary time' reproduction to a 'real time' reproduction regime.
Due to the variations at the genomic level (such as base tautomery), the
starving cell has to be represented as a superposition of different components,
all 'reproducing in imaginary time'. Adidtion of a selective substrate,
allowing only one of these components to amplify, will cause Wick rotation and
amplification of this component, thus justifying the occurence of the R-D-error
correlation. Further ramifications of the proposed ideas for evolutionary
theory are discussed.

each edge a player must pay a cost \alpha, and the individual cost for a player
represents a trade-off between edge costs and shortest path lengths to all
other players. We extend the model to a penalized game (PCG), for which we
reduce the penalty counted towards the individual cost for a pair of
disconnected players to a finite value \beta. Our analysis concentrates on
existence, structure, and cost of disconnected Nash and strong equilibria.
Although the PCG is not a potential game, pure Nash equilibria always and pure
strong equilibria very often exist. We provide tight conditions under which
disconnected Nash (strong) equilibria can evolve. Components of these
equilibria must be Nash (strong) equilibria of a smaller NCG. However, in
contrast to the NCG, for almost all parameter values no tree is a stable
component. Finally, we present a detailed characterization of the price of
anarchy that reveals cases in which the price of anarchy is \Theta(n) and thus
several orders of magnitude larger than in the NCG. Perhaps surprisingly, the
strong price of anarchy increases to at most 4. This indicates that global
communication and coordination can be extremely valuable to overcome socially
inferior topologies in distributed selfish network design.

confinement of quarks, in terms of bag over the threshold in the excitation

from red giant mass loss and here we model the interaction between this stellar
mass loss and the hot ambient medium. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations, we adopt a temperature for the ambient medium of 3E6 K along with
a range of ambient densities and stellar velocities. When the stellar velocity
is supersonic relative to the ambient medium, a bow shock occurs, along with a
shock driven into the stellar ejecta, which heats only a fraction of the gas.
Behind the bow shock, a cool wake develops but the fast flow of the hot medium
causes Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to grow and these fingers are shocked and
heated (without radiative cooling). Along with the mixing of this wake material
with the hot medium, most of the stellar ejecta is heated to approximately the
temperature of the hot ambient medium within 2 pc of the star. With the
addition of radiative cooling, some wake material remains cool (< 1E5 K),
accounting for up to 25% of the stellar mass loss. Less cooled gas survives
when the ambient density is lower or when the stellar velocity is higher than
in our reference case. These results suggest that some cooled gas should be
present in the inner part of early-type galaxies that have a hot ambient
medium. These calculations may explain the observed distributed optical
emission line gas as well as the presence of dust in early-type galaxies.

Under the assumption that the L\'evy measure of the inverse local time is

the ""rate limiting step"" in a complex reaction network by evaluating how the
overall rate of product formation changes when a small change is made in one of
the kinetic parameters. We examine two definitions of this concept by applying
it to first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the CO oxidation at
RuO2(110). Instead of studying experimental data we examine simulations,
because in them we know the surface structure, reaction mechanism, the rate
constants, the coverage of the surface and the turn-over frequency at steady
state. We can test whether the insights provided by the DRC are in agreement
with the results of the simulations thus avoiding the uncertainties inherent in
a comparison with experiment. We find that the information provided by using
the DRC is non-trivial: It could not have been obtained from the knowledge of
the reaction mechanism and of the magnitude of the rate constants alone. For
the simulations the DRC provides furthermore guidance as to which aspects of
the reaction mechanism should be treated accurately and which can be studied by
less accurate and more efficient methods. We therefore conclude that a
sensitivity analysis based on the DRC is a useful tool for understanding the
propagation of errors from the electronic structure calculations to the
statistical simulations in first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

compared them to a grid of models to extract the relations between the
supernova properties and the luminosity-weighted age/composition of the host
galaxies. The same analysis was applied to a large number of early-type field
galaxies selected from the SDSS spectroscopic survey. We find no difference in
the age and abundance distributions between the field galaxies and the SN Ia
host galaxies. We do find a strong correlation suggesting that SNe Ia in
galaxies whose populations have a characteristic age greater than 5 Gyr are ~ 1
mag fainter at V(max) than those found in galaxies with younger populations.
However, the data cannot discriminate between a smooth relation connecting age
and supernova luminosity or two populations of SN Ia progenitors. We find that
SN Ia distance residuals in the Hubble diagram are correlated with host-galaxy
metal abundance, consistent with the predictions of Timmes, Brown & Truran
(2003). The data show that high iron abundance galaxies host less-luminous
supernovae. We thus conclude that the time since progenitor formation primarily
determines the radioactive Ni production while progenitor metal abundance has a
weaker influence on peak luminosity, but one not fully corrected by light-curve
shape and color fitters. Assuming no selection effects in discovering SNe Ia in
local early-type galaxies, we find a higher specific SN Ia rate in E/S0
galaxies with ages below 3 Gyr than in older hosts. The higher rate and
brighter luminosities seen in the youngest E/S0 hosts may be a result of recent
star formation and represents a tail of the ""prompt"" SN Ia progenitors.

proposed outer bounds reduce to new capacity outer bounds for the discrete
memory broadcast channel.

the behavior of the atom-field interaction in photonic crystals. By studying
the spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal with one-band
isotropic model, we found that the long-time inducing memory of the spontaneous
emission is a fractional phenomenon. This behavior could be well described by
the fractional calculus. And the results show no steady photon-atom bound state
for the atomic resonant transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed
band edge which is encountered in the previous study [J. Opt. B: Quantum
Semiclass. Opt. {\bf 5}, R43 (2003)]. The correctness of this result is
validated by the ``cut-off smoothing'' density of photon states (DOS) with
fractional calculus. By obtaining a rigorous solution without the
multiple-valued problem for the system, we show the method of fractional
calculus has logically concise property.

observed 10 mum feature of protoplanetary disks and how this may affect the
interpretation of the observations.
  Methods: Using a combination of modeling tools, we simulated the
sedimentation of a dust grain size distribution in an axisymmetric 2-D model of
a turbulent protoplanetary disk, and we used a radiative transfer program to
compute the resulting spectra.
  Results: We find that the sedimentation can turn a flat feature into a pointy
one, but only to a limited degree and for a very limited set of particle size
distributions. Only if we have a bimodal size distribution, i.e. a very small
grain population and a bigger grain population, do we find that the
transformation from a flat to a pointy feature upon dust sedimentation is
strong. However, our model shows that, if sedimentation is the sole reason for
the variety of silicate feature strengths observed in protoplanetary disks,
then we would expect to find a correlation such that disks with weak mid- to
far-infrared excess have a stronger 10 mum silicate feature than disks with a
strong mid- to far-infrared excess. If this is contrary to what is observed,
then this would indicate that sedimentation cannot be the main reason for the
variety of 10 mum silicate features observed in protoplanetary disks.

characteristic variety of the configuration space of $n$ distinct labeled

degree of $\alpha$ and the codimension of the zero set of $\alpha$ on a good
