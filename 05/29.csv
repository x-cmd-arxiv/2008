models with universal extra dimensions (UEDs), emphasizing the complementarity
between high-energy colliders and dark matter direct detection experiments. In
models with relatively small mass splittings between the dark matter candidate
and the rest of the (colored) spectrum, the collider sensitivity is diminished,
but direct detection rates are enhanced. UEDs provide a natural framework for
such mass degeneracies. We consider both 5-dimensional and 6-dimensional
non-minimal UED models, and discuss the detection prospects for various KK dark
matter candidates: the KK photon $\gamma_1$, the KK $Z$-boson $Z_1$, the KK
Higgs boson $H_1$ and the spinless KK photon $\gamma_H$. We combine collider
limits such as electroweak precision data and expected LHC reach, with
cosmological constraints from WMAP, and the sensitivity of current or planned
direct detection experiments. Allowing for general mass splittings, we show
that neither colliders, nor direct detection experiments by themselves can
explore all of the relevant KK dark matter parameter space. Nevertheless, they
probe different parameter space regions, and the combination of the two types
of constraints can be quite powerful. For example, in the case of $\gamma_1$ in
5D UEDs the relevant parameter space will be almost completely covered by the
combined LHC and direct detection sensitivities expected in the near future.

of these sources in terms of embedded young clusters. We derive extinctions and
ionising photon production rates for two of the clusters.

during a bright event that occurred in 2006 September, and which was
simultaneous with a detection at 0.15-1 TeV energies by the MAGIC telescope. We
analyse the hard X-ray emission from 18 to 700 keV with the INTEGRAL data taken
on 2006 September 24-26. We present the light curves and fit the high energy
spectrum with various spectral models. Despite variations in the flux by a
factor of ~2 in the the 20-700 keV energy band, the shape of the energy
spectrum remained remarkably stable. It is very well represented by an e-folded
power law with the photon index of 1.4 and a high energy cut-off around 130-140
keV. The spectrum is also well described by thermal Comptonisation including a
moderate reflection component, with a reflectionamplitude R around 0.4. The
temperature of the hot Comptonising electrons is ~70 keV and their Thomson
optical depth is ~2.5. These spectral properties are typical of those observed
in the low/hard state. This shows that Cyg X-1 may stay in the low hard state
at least up to the flux level of 2 Crab, which corresponds to ~2-3 percent of
the Eddington luminosity. It is the first time a persistent high-mass
black-hole binary is observed at a few percent of the Eddington luminosity with
a stable low/hard state spectrum over a period of a few days. The TeV detection
coincides with the peak of a small X-ray flare just after a very fast rise in
hard X-ray flux. In contrast, the source remained undetected by MAGIC at the
peak of a larger X-ray flare occurring one day later and corresponding to the
maximum of the X-ray luminosity of the whole outburst. We do not find any
obvious correlation between the X-ray and TeV emission.

phase functions associated with photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) for
high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The generation of secure
quantum keys requires not only this pure phase basis, but also additional bases
comprised of orthonormal superposition states formed from the pure states.
These bases are also known as mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and include
quantum states whose wave functions are modulated in both phase and amplitude.
While modulo 2\pi optical path control with high-resolution spatial light
modulators (SLMs) is well suited to creating the azimuthal phases associated
with the pure states, it does not introduce the amplitude modulation associated
with the MUB superposition states. Using computer-generated holography (CGH)
with the Leith-Upatnieks approach to hologram recording however, both phase and
amplitude modulation can be achieved. This paper presents a description of the
OAM states of a 3-dimensional MUB system and analyzes the construction of these
states via CGH with a phase modulating SLM. The effects of phase holography
artifacts on quantum-state generation are quantified and a prescription for
avoiding these artifacts by preconditioning the hologram function is presented.
Practical effects associated with spatially isolating the first-order
diffracted field are also quantified and a demonstration utilizing a liquid
crystal SLM is presented.

permeated by non-uniform magnetic field has been done. It has been found that
the Gradient of Magnetic Field when coupled with Rotation becomes capable to
generate few instabilities (Temporal or Spatial) leading to the damping or
amplification of MHD waves. The Jean's criterion is not sufficient for
stability always. Rather, the waves will suffer instability unless their wave
length (frequency) is less (greater) than certain critical values. Otherwise,
those will smoothly propagate outward. Out of different scenarioes depending on
the direction of the magnetic field, its gradient, rotation and wave
propagation three important Special Cases have been discussed and different
stability criteria have been derived.
  Finally, using the above theory we have obtained the stability/instability
criteria for the waves moving parallel and perpendicular to the galactic plane
in the Core and Periphery of the Central Region of Galaxy (C.R.G.) due to the
coupled action of Rotation and Non-Uniform Magnetic field. The possibility of
heating or occuring diffused condition inside the central region by MHD waves
or smooth propagation of these waves (under some restrictions) through the
C.R.G. has been briefly discussed. The numerical values of the parameters of
those waves for instabilities or smooth propagation have been estimated
roughly. One may find some clues for the formation of Halo and Spiral Arms.

represent extreme assumptions on the role of collisional excitation and
ionisation by neutral hydrogen for the NLTE level populations of neutral
oxygen. The error of our analysis is +-0.04 +- 0.03 dex, the last being related

recommended value, considering our present ignorance of the role of collisions
with hydrogen atoms on the NLTE level populations of oxygen, is
log(Noxygen/Nhydrogen) = 8.76 +- 0.07. The reasons which have led to lower O
abundances in the past are identified as (1) the lower equivalent widths

stress history. We calculate how the stress history with a given
parametrization affects the CMB observables, and a qualitative discussion of
the physical effects involved is supplemented with numerical examples. It is
found that, in general, alternative gravity theories can be efficiently
constrained by the CMB temperature and polarization spectra. There exist,
however, special cases where modified gravity cannot be distinguished from the
CDM model even by using both CMB and matter power spectrum observations, nor
can they be efficiently restricted by other observables in perturbed
cosmologies. Our results show how the stress properties of dark matter, which
determine the evolutions of both density perturbations and the gravitational

equations and without assuming any specific theoretical gravitational theory

behind this calculation, we use a Fokker-Planck equation derived by BPS to
compute the electron-ion energy partitioning of a charged particle traversing a
plasma. The motivation for this application is ignition for inertial
confinement fusion -- more energy delivered to the ions means a better chance
of ignition, and conversely. It is therefore important to calculate the
fractional energy loss to electrons and ions as accurately as possible, as this
could have implications for the Laser Megajoule (LMJ) facility in France and
the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States. The traditional
method by which one calculates the electron-ion energy splitting of a charged
particle traversing a plasma involves integrating the stopping power dE/dx.
However, as the charged particle slows down and becomes thermalized into the
background plasma, this method of calculating the electron-ion energy splitting
breaks down. As a result, the method suffers a systematic error of order T/E0,
where T is the plasma temperature and E0 is the initial energy of the charged
particle. In the case of DT fusion, for example, this can lead to uncertainties
as high as 10% or so. The formalism presented here is designed to account for
the thermalization process, and in contrast, it provides results that are
near-exact.

resolution for NIR and MIR, resp. The first K-band fringe detection of a GC
star suggests that IRS7 could be marginally resolved at 2um, which would imply
that the photosphere of the supergiant is enshrouded by a molecular and dusty
envelope. At 10um, IRS7 is strongly resolved with a visibility of approximately
0.2. The MIR is dominated by moderately warm (200 K), extended dust, mostly
distributed outside of a radius of about 120 AU (15 mas) around the star. A
deep 9.8-silicate absorption in excess of the usual extinction law with respect
to the NIR extinction has been found. This confirms recent findings of a
relatively enhanced, interstellar 9.8-silicate absorption with respect to the
NIR extinction towards another star in the central arcsec, suggesting an
unusual dust composition in that region. Our VLTI observations show that
interferometric NIR phase-referencing experiments with mas resolution using
IRS7 as phase-reference appear to be feasible, but more such studies are
required to definitely characterize the close environment around this star. We
demonstrate that interferometry is required to resolve the innermost

compact object mergers, focusing on the energy available from accretion at late
times and the composition of the disk and its outflows. We calculate the
dynamics near the outer edge of the disk, which contains the majority of the
mass and sets the accretion rate onto the central black hole. This allows us to
follow the evolution over much longer timescales than current hydrodynamic
simulations. At late times the disk becomes advective and its properties
asymptote to self-similar solutions with accretion rate dM/dt ~ t^(-4/3)
(neglecting outflows). This late-time accretion can in principle provide
sufficient energy to power the late-time activity observed from some
short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, because outflows during the
advective phase unbind the majority of the remaining mass, it is difficult for
the remnant disk alone to produce significant accretion power well beyond the
onset of the advective phase. Unless the viscosity is quite low (alpha ~1e-3),
this occurs before the start of observed flaring at ~ 30 s; continued mass
inflow thus appears required to explain the late-time activity from short GRBs.
We show that the composition of the disk freezes-out relatively neutron-rich
(electron fraction Ye ~ 0.3). Roughly 1e-2 Msun of this neutron-rich material
is ejected by winds at late times. During earlier, neutrino-cooled phases of
accretion, neutrino irradiation of the disk produces a wind with Ye ~ 0.5,
which synthesizes at most ~ 1e-3 Msun of Ni56. We highlight what conditions are
favorable for Ni56 production and predict, in the best cases, optical and
infrared transients peaking ~ 0.5-2 days after the burst, with fluxes a factor
of ~ 10 below the current observational limits.

wide-area Chandra observations. The sample has a total of 6295 unique sources
over an area of $\rm 11.8deg^2$ and is the largest used to date to determine
the X-ray number counts. We determine, for the first time, the break flux in
the 5-10 keV band, in the case of a double power-law source count distribution.
We also find an upturn in the 0.5-2keV counts at fluxes below about
6e-17erg/s/cm2. We show that this can be explained by the emergence of normal
star-forming galaxies which dominate the X-ray population at faint fluxes. The
fraction of the diffuse X-ray background resolved into point sources at
different spectral bands is also estimated. It is argued that a single
population of Compton thick AGN cannot be responsible for the entire unresolved

function. The simulated host plus active nucleus systems span broad ranges in
luminosity, structural properties, redshift, and polarization; this allows us
to test the response of the results against each of these parameters.
  Our simulations show that, as expected, the measured polarization is always
lower than the intrinsic value, due to the contamination by non-polarized star
light from the host. This effect is more significant when the host is brighter
than the active nucleus, and/or a large photometric aperture is used. On the
other hand, if seeing changes along the observing time under certain particular
conditions, spurious microvariability could be obtained, especially when using
a small photometric aperture. We thus give some recommendations in order to
minimise both unwanted effects, as well as basic guidelines to estimate a lower
limit of the true (nuclear) polarization.
  As an example, we apply the results of our simulations to real polarimetric
observations, with high temporal resolution, of the blazar PKS 0521-365.

channels, where the number of independent data-streams is adapted to trade-off
the data-rate with the transmitter complexity. Towards the goal of a
low-complexity implementation, a structured precoder is proposed, where the
precoder matrix evolves fairly slowly at a rate comparable with the statistical
evolution of the channel. Here, the eigenvectors of the precoder matrix
correspond to the dominant eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix,
whereas the power allocation across the modes is fixed, known at both the ends,
and is of low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme (semiunitary
precoding), where the spatial modes are excited with equal power, is shown to
be near-optimal in matched channels. A matched channel is one where the
dominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and
their number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive
covariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels, where the
above conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with
semiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information
benchmark is substantial. This loss needs to be mitigated via limited feedback
techniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. More
importantly, we develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of
a channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix
channels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.

dominated by photospheric continuum. We have used FUSE to obtain spectra of the
subcoronal O VI emission lines, which lie at a wavelength where the
photospheric continuum of the mid- and early-A stars is relatively weak. We
observed 14 stars spanning a range in T_eff from 7720 to 10,000 K. Eleven of
the 14 stars showed O VI emission lines, including 6 of the 8 targets with
T_eff > 8300 K. At face value, this suggests that activity does not fall off
with increasing temperature. However, the emission lines are narrower than
expected from the projected rotational velocities of these rapidly-rotating
stars, suggesting that the emission could come from unresolved late-type
companions. Furthermore, the strength of the O VI emission is consistent with
that expected from an unseen active K or M dwarf binary companinon, and the
high x-ray to far uv luminosity ratios observed indicate that this must be the
case. Our results are therefore consistent with earlier studies that have shown
a rapid drop-off in activity at the radiative/convective boundary expected at
T_eff about 8300 K, in agreement with conventional stellar structure models.

specific scenario, Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity, gives rise to a
potentially observable anomaly in the solar system: all planets would exhibit a
common anomalous precession, dw/dt, in excess of the prediction of General
Relativity. We have used the Planetary Ephemeris Program (PEP) along with
planetary radar and radio tracking data to set a constraint of |dw/dt| < 0.02
arcseconds per century on the presence of any such common precession. This
sensitivity falls short of that needed to detect the estimated universal
precession of |dw/dt| = 5e-4 arcseconds per century expected in the DGP
scenario. We discuss the fact that ranging data between objects that orbit in a
common plane cannot constrain the DGP scenario. It is only through the relative
inclinations of the planetary orbital planes that solar system ranging data
have sensitivity to the DGP-like effect of universal precession. In addition,
we illustrate the importance of performing a numerical evaluation of the
sensitivity of the data set and model to any perturbative precession.

  We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what

program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The

replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of

we replace functors to sets by categories fibered in groupoids, allowing us to
keep track of automorphisms, and we work with deformation problems naturally
associated to a scheme X, and which naturally localize on X, so that we can
formalize the local behavior. The first step is already carried out by Rim in
the context of his homogeneous groupoids, but we develop the theory
substantially further. In this setting, many statements known for a range of

magnetic polarities is consistent with the Hale-Nicholson's polarity law. These

X-ray Observatory of the gravitationally lensed quasars RX J1131-1231 and HE

quasars. The flux variability detected in image A of RX J1131-1231 is of
particular interest because of its high amplitude (a factor of ~ 20). We
interpret it as arising from microlensing since the variability is uncorrelated
with that of the other images and the X-ray flux ratios show larger changes
than the optical as we would expect for microlensing of the more compact X-ray
emission regions. The differences between the X-ray and optical flux ratios of
HE 1104-1805 are less dramatic, but there is no significant soft X-ray or dust
absorption, implying the presence of X-ray microlensing in this system as well.
Combining the X-ray data with the optical light curves we find that the X-ray
emitting region of HE 1104-1805 is compact with a half-light radius ~ 6 r_g,
where the gravitational radius is r_g = 3.6 x 10^14 cm, thus placing
significant constraints on AGN corona models. We also find that the

dominated by dark matter. Finally, we better characterize the massive
foreground cluster near RX J1131-1231, set limits on other sources of extended

sigma) times fainter than the observed images.

the magnetic phases of Ho near the $M_{4,5}$ absorption edges. At the $M_5$
edge in the uniform helical phase, the calculated spectra of the absorption
coefficient, the RXS intensities at the first and second satellite spots
capture the properties the experimental data possess, such as the spectral
shapes and the peak positions. This demonstrates the plausibility of the
adoption of the localized picture in this material and the effectiveness of the
spectral shape analysis. The latter point is markedly valuable since the
azimuthal angle dependence, which is one of the most useful informations RXS
can provides, is lacking in the experimental conditions. Then, by focusing on
the temperature dependence of the spectral shape at the second satellite spot,
we expect that the spectrum is the contribution of the pure rank two profile in
the uniform helical and the conical phases while that is dominated by the rank
one profile in the intermediate temperature phase, so-called spin slip phase.
The change of the spectral shape as a function of temperature indicates a
direct evidence of the change of magnetic structures undergoing. Furthermore,
we predict that the intensity, which is the same order observed at the second
satellite spot, is expected at the fourth satellite spot from the conical phase

luminescence measurements on two defects chosen as model systems for our
analysis: extrinsic Oxygen Deficient Centers (ODC(II)) in amorphous silica and
F+ 3 centers in crystalline Lithium Fluoride. Measurements evidence that only
defects embedded in the amorphous matrix feature a dependence of the radiative
decay lifetime on the emission energy and a time dependence of the first moment
of the emission band. A theoretical model is developed to link these properties
to the structural disorder typical of amorphous solids. Specifically, the
observations on ODC(II) are interpreted by introducing a gaussian statistical
distribution of the zero phonon line energy position. Comparison with the
results obtained on F+ 3 crystalline defects strongly confirms the validity of
the model. By analyzing experimental data within this frame, we obtain separate
estimations of the homogenous and inhomogeneous contributions to the measured
total linewidth of ODC(II), which results to be mostly inhomogeneous.

models from loosely annotated images for automatic image annotation and
indexing. The given annotation in training images is loose due to: (1)
ambiguous correspondences between visual features and annotated keywords; (2)
incomplete lists of annotated keywords. The second reason motivates us to
enrich the incomplete annotation in a simple way before learning topic models.
In particular, some imagined keywords are poured into the incomplete annotation
through measuring similarity between keywords. Then, both given and imagined
annotations are used to learning probabilistic topic models for automatically
annotating new images. We conduct experiments on a typical Corel dataset of
images and loose annotations, and compare the proposed method with
state-of-the-art discrete annotation methods (using a set of discrete blobs to
represent an image). The proposed method improves word-driven probability
Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA-words) up to a comparable performance with the
best discrete annotation method, while a merit of PLSA-words is still kept,

frequencies from 1mHz to 10kHz. The shear-mechanical relaxation spectra show
two processes, which follow the typical scenario of a structural (alpha)
relaxation and an additional (Johari-Goldstein) beta relaxation. The dielectric
relaxation spectra are dominated by a Debye-type peak with an additional
non-Debye peak visible. This Debye-type relaxation is a common feature peculiar
to mono-alcohols. The time scale of the non-Debye dielectric relaxation process
is shown to correspond to the mechanical structural (alpha) relaxation.
Glass-transition temperatures and fragilities are reported based on the
mechanical alpha relaxation and the dielectric Debye-type process, showing that
the two glass-transition temperatures differ by approximately 10K and that the
fragility based on the Debye-type process is a factor of two smaller than the
structural fragility. If a mechanical signature of the Debye-type relaxation
exists in these liquids, its relaxation strength is at most 1% and 3% of the
full relaxation strength of 2-butanol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol respectively. These
findings support the notion that it is the non-Debye dielectric relaxation

numbers, the more the formation of $\alpha$ cluster is difficult inside the
mother nucleus. The penetration probabilities reflect that 126 is a neutron
magic number. The penetration probability range is very large compared to that

between the stars, while further downstream the gas is assumed to behave
ballistically. An archimedean spiral structure is formed by the motion of the
stars, with clear resemblance to high resolution images of the so-called

particle hydrodynamic models is its significantly reduced computational cost,
while it also allows the study of the structure obtained in an eccentric orbit.
The model is relevant to symbiotic systems and Gamma-ray binaries, as well as
systems with O-type and Wolf-Rayet stars.
  As an example application, we simulate the X-ray emission from hypothetical
O+O and WR+O star binaries, and describe a method of ray tracing through the 3D
spiral structure to account for absorption by the circumstellar material in the

target surface contaminations due to residual gases in the vacuum as well as
from inhomogeneities and instabilities in the deuteron density distribution in
the targets. In order to address these problems an improved differential

scrutiny of the other experiments demonstrates that the observed unusual

rotor having twelve proton-binding sites. This model is closely related to the
membrane-embedded F$_0$ motor of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which
converts the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons
into mechanical motion of the rotor. It is shown that the Coulomb coupling
between the negative charge of the empty rotor site and the positive stator
charge, located near the periplasmic proton-conducting channel (proton source),
plays a dominant role in the torque-generating process. When approaching the
source outlet, the rotor site has a proton energy level higher than the energy
level of the site, located near the cytoplasmic channel (proton drain). In the
first stage of this torque-generating process, the energy of the
electrochemical potential is converted into potential energy of the
proton-binding sites on the rotor. Afterwards, the tangential component of the
Coulomb force produces a mechanical torque. We demonstrate that, at low
temperatures, the loaded motor works in the shuttling regime where the energy
of the electrochemical potential is consumed without producing any
unidirectional rotation. The motor switches to the torque-generating regime at
high temperatures, when the Brownian ratchet mechanism turns on. In the
presence of a significant external torque, created by ATP hydrolysis, the
system operates as a proton pump, which translocates protons against the
transmembrane potential gradient. Here we focus on the F$_0$ motor, even though
our analysis is applicable to the bacterial flagellar motor.

halo. The model is axially and reflection symmetric and its time evolution is
self-similar. It describes the halo as a set of discrete dark matter flows with
stated densities and velocity vectors everywhere. We first discuss the general
conditions under which the time evolution of a cold collisionless
self-gravitating fluid is self-similar, and show that symmetry is not necessary
for self-similarity. When spherical symmetry is imposed, the model is the same
as described by Fillmore and Goldreich, and by Bertschinger, twenty-three years
ago. The spherically symmetric model depends on one dimensionless parameter
$\epsilon$ and two dimensionful parameters. We set $\epsilon$ = 0.3, a value
consistent with the slope of the power spectrum of density perturbations on
galactic scales. The dimensionful parameters are determined by the Galactic
rotation velocity (220 km/s) at the position of the Sun and by the age of the
Galaxy (13.7 Gyr). The properties of the outer caustics are derived in the
spherically symmetric model. The structure of the inner halo depends on the
angular momentum distribution of the dark matter particles. We assume that
distribution to be axial and reflection symmetric, and dominated by net overall
rotation. The inner caustics are rings whose radii are determined in terms of a
single additional parameter $j_{\rm max}$. We summarize the observational
evidence in support of the model. The evidence is consistent with $j_{\rm max}$
= 0.18 in Concordance Cosmology, equivalent to $j_{\rm max,old}$ = 0.26 in
Einstein - de Sitter cosmology. We give formulas to estimate the flow densities
and velocity vectors anywhere in the Milky Way halo. The properties of the

select a sample of fast rotating ultracool dwarfs with no detectable radio
activity at 8.5 GHz, observing each of them at 4.9 GHz. From the 8 dwarfs in

level of 286 $\pm$ 24 $\mu Jy$. The light-curve of 2MASS J07464256+2000321, is
dominated towards the end of the observation by a very bright, $\approx $100 %
left circularly polarized burst during which the flux reached 2.4 mJy. The
burst was preceded by a raise in the level of activity, with the average flux
being $\approx$ 160 $\mu Jy$ in the first hour of observation rising to
$\approx$ 400 $\mu Jy$ in the 40 minutes before the burst. During both periods,
there is significant variability. The detection of 100% circular polarization

emission mechanism. However, the observations at 4.9 GHz and 8.5 GHz were not
simultaneous, thus the actual fraction of dwarfs capable of producing radio
emission, as well as the fraction of those that show periodic pulsations is
still unclear, as indeed are the relative roles played by the electron
