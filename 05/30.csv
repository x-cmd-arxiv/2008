advantages of both single dishes and interferometers. The electric field is
digitized by antennas on a rectangular grid, after which a series of Fast
Fourier Transforms recovers simultaneous multifrequency images of up to half
the sky. Thanks to Moore's law, the bandwidth up to which this is feasible has
now reached about 1 GHz, and will likely continue doubling every couple of
years. The main advantages over a single dish telescope are cost and orders of
magnitude larger field-of-view, translating into dramatically better
sensitivity for large-area surveys. The key advantages over traditional
interferometers are cost (the correlator computational cost for an N-element
array scales as N log N rather than N^2) and a compact synthesized beam. We
argue that 21 cm tomography could be an ideal first application of a very large
Fast Fourier Transform Telescope, which would provide both massive sensitivity
improvements per dollar and mitigate the off-beam point source foreground
problem with its clean beam. Another potentially interesting application is
cosmic microwave background polarization.

Galactic dark matter subhalos in gamma-rays from dark matter pair annihilations
in their centers. Our method is based on a hybrid approach, employing the
highest resolution numerical simulations available (including the recently
completed one billion particle Via Lactea II simulation) as well as analytical
models for the extrapolation beyond the simulations' resolution limit. We
include a self-consistent treatment of subhalo boost factors, motivated by our
numerical results, and a realistic treatment of the expected backgrounds that
individual subhalos must outshine. We show that for reasonable values of the
dark matter particle physics parameters (M_X ~ 50 - 500 GeV and <sigma*v> ~
10^-26 - 10^-25 cm^3/s) GLAST may very well discover a few, even up to several
dozen, such subhalos, at 5 sigma significance, and some at more than 20 sigma.
We predict that the majority of luminous sources would be resolved with GLAST's
expected angular resolution. For most observer locations the angular
distribution of detectable subhalos is consistent with a uniform distribution
across the sky. The brightest subhalos tend to be massive (median Vmax of 24
km/s) and therefore likely hosts of dwarf galaxies, but many subhalos with Vmax
as low as 5 km/s are also visible. Typically detectable subhalos are 20 - 40
kpc from the observer, and only a small fraction are closer than 10 kpc. The
total number of observable subhalos has not yet converged in our simulations,
and we estimate that we may be missing up to 3/4 of all detectable subhalos.

has a time-dependent anisotropy in momentum space. Such anisotropies can arise
during the earliest stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution due to the rapid
longitudinal expansion of the created matter. Two phenomenological models for
the proper time dependence of the parton hard momentum scale, p_hard, and the
plasma anisotropy parameter, xi, are constructed which describe the transition
of the plasma from its initial non-equilibrium state to an isotropic
thermalized state. The first model constructed interpolates between 1+1
dimensional free streaming at early times and 1+1 dimensional ideal
hydrodynamical expansion at late times. In the second model we include the
effect of collisional broadening of the parton distribution functions in the
early-time pre-equilibrium stage of plasma evolution. We find for both cases
that for fixed initial conditions high-energy dilepton production is enhanced
by pre-equilibrium emission. When the models are constrained to fixed final
pion multiplicity the dependence of the resulting spectra on the assumed plasma
isotropization time is reduced. Using our most realistic
collisionally-broadened model we find that high-transverse momentum dilepton
production would be enhanced by at most 40% at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider and 50% at CERN Large Hadron Collider if one assumes an
isotropization/thermalization time of 2 fm/c. Given sufficiently precise
experimental data this enhancement could be used to determine the plasma
isotropization time experimentally.

black holes close enought to each other such that gravitational radiation
becomes the leading dissipative effect. Gravitational radiation takes away
energy, momentum and angular momentum from the compact binary, such that the
black holes finally merge. In the process, the spin of the dominant black hole
is reoriented. On observational level, the spins are directly related to the
jets, which can be seen at radio frequencies. Images of the X-shaped radio
galaxies together with evidence on the age of the jets illustrate that the jets
are reoriented, a phenomenon known as spin-flip. Based on the galaxy luminosity
statistics we argue here that the typical galaxy encounters involve mass ratios
between 1:3 to 1:30 for the central black holes. Based on the spin-orbit
precession and gravitational radiation we also argue that for this typical mass
ratio in the inspiral phase of the merger the initially dominant orbital
angular momentum will become smaller than the spin, which will be reoriented.
We prove here that the spin-flip phenomenon typically occurs already in the

proposed as the source for the excitation of Alfv\'en waves. However, the
photosphere is a) very weakly ionized, and, b) the dynamics of the plasma

facts on the above scenario and their effects on the electromagnetic waves. It
is shown that the ions and electrons in the photosphere are both un-magnetized;
their collision frequency with neutrals is much larger than the gyro-frequency.
This implies that eventual Alfv\'en-type electromagnetic perturbations must
involve the neutrals as well. This has the following serious consequences: i)
in the presence of perturbations, the whole fluid (plasma + neutrals) moves;
ii) the Alfv\'en velocity includes the total (plasma + neutrals) density and is
thus considerably smaller compared to the collision-less case; iii) the
perturbed velocity of a unit volume, which now includes both plasma and
neutrals, becomes much smaller compared to the ideal (collision-less) case; and
iv) the corresponding wave energy flux for the given parameters becomes much
smaller compared to the ideal case.

Surprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One
frequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or
better-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut
edges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].
This definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community
detection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher
than expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative
definition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have
more influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We
present a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based
modularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into
communities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in

including spin-down and wandering of the fuel impact point around the magnetic
pole. In this Letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source are
coherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all of
the observed fluctuations. Only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretion
rates, shows a significant phase offset. We discuss what might lead to such
rigid phase-locking between the modulations in the accretion and thermonuclear
burst emission, and consider the implications for spin variation and the burst
oscillation mechanism. Wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixed
magnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phase
variations. This means that the burst asymmetry is coupled to the hot spot, not
the magnetic pole. If premature ignition at this point (due to higher local
temperatures) triggers a burning front that stalls before spreading over the
entire surface, the resulting localized nuclear hot spot may explain the
unusual burst and burst oscillation properties of this source.

raising the tantalizing questions of the different pairing mechanisms in these

are the superconducting gap, its value, structure, and temperature dependence.
Here we report the observation of a single gap in the superconductor
SmFeAsO_0.85F_0.15 with T_C = 42 K as measured by Andreev spectroscopy. The gap
value of 2Delta = 13.34+/-0.3 meV gives 2Delta/k_BT_C = 3.68, close to the BCS

manner consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) prediction but
dramatically different from that of the pseudogap behavior in the cuprate

which is nearly isotropic in size across different sections of the Fermi

continuous. We provide scaling arguments to suggest that the change in the
order of the transitions in going from a monolayer to bilayer adsorbed system
results from the interactions of defects in the multilayers. We also report

which was achieved by partial substitution of the barium site with potassium.
We have discovered bulk superconductivity up to Tc = 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2
with x = 0.4. The parent compound BaFe2As2 as well as KFe2As2 both crystallize
in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure, which consists of (FeAs)- iron
arsenide layers separated by barium or potassium ions. BaFe2As2 is a poor metal
and exhibits a SDW anomaly at 140 K. By substituting Ba2+ for K+ ions we have
introduced holes in the (FeAs)- layers, which suppress the SDW anomaly and
induce superconductivity. This scenario is very similar to the recently
discovered arsenide-oxide superconductors. The Tc of 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 is
the highest observed critical temperature in hole doped iron arsenide
superconductors so far. Therefore, we were able to expand this class of
superconductors by oxygen-free compounds with the ThCr2Si2-type structure. Our
results suggest, that superconductivity in these systems essentially evolves
from the (FeAs)- layers and may occur in other related compounds.

well as the standard model. We assume that the quirk mass m is in the
phenomenologically interesting range 100 GeV--TeV, and that the new gauge group
gets strong at a scale Lambda < m. In this case breaking of strings is
exponentially suppressed, and quirk production results in strings that are long
compared to 1/Lambda. The existence of these long stable strings leads to
highly exotic events at colliders. For 100 eV < Lambda < keV the strings are
macroscopic, giving rise to events with two separated quirk tracks with
measurable curvature toward each other due to the string interaction. For keV <
Lambda < MeV the typical strings are mesoscopic: too small to resolve in the
detector, but large compared to atomic scales. In this case, the bound state
appears as a single particle, but its mass is the invariant mass of a quirk
pair, which has an event-by-event distribution. For MeV < Lambda < m the
strings are microscopic, and the quirks annihilate promptly within the
detector. For colored quirks, this can lead to hadronic fireball events with
10^3 hadrons with energy of order GeV emitted in conjunction with hard decay
products from the final annihilation.

explore the extent to which transient outflows injecting directed energy and

turbulent motions. We show that turbulence can readily be sustained by these
interactions and show that it is possible to broadly characterize an effective
driving scale of the outflows. We compare the velocity spectrum obtained in our

outflow driven turbulence a power law is indeed achieved. However we find a
steeper spectrum (beta ~ 3) is obtained in outflow driven turbulence models

capture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \emph{White-Box
Property (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the
WBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a
\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an
obfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak
some ``useless'' non-black-box information.
  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an
obfuscation (under \emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every
specification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a
\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply
that under \emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We
then show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist
(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.
  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a
non-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain
specification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but
approximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.
  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between
``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information.

of two types of white dwarf-main sequence star (WDMS) binaries within the
cataclysmic variable period gap. The first are post-common envelope binaries
with secondary stars that have masses between 0.17 and 0.36 Msun (gPCEBs), such
that they will commence mass transfer within the period gap. The second type
are systems that were CVs at some point in their past, but detached once they
evolved down in orbital period to ~3 h as a consequence of disrupted magnetic
braking, and are crossing the period gap via gravitational radiation (dCVs).
Full population synthesis calculations are performed where we assume either
constant, global values of the common envelope ejection efficiency, or consider
the ejection efficiency as a function of secondary mass. Several forms of
magnetic braking are also considered. We predict an excess of dCVs over gPCEBs
within the period gap of ~4 to ~13 assuming an ejection efficiency between 0.1
and 0.6, and a flat initial mass ratio distribution. This excess is revealed as
a prominent peak at the location of the period gap in the orbital period
distribution of the combined gPCEB and dCV population. We suggest that if such
a feature is observed in the orbital period distribution of an observed sample

which incorporates the effects due to the quasiparticle-number fluctuation
(QNF) around Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean field and dynamic coupling to
quasiparticle-pair vibrations within the self-consistent quasiparticle
random-phase approximation (SCQRPA). The numerical calculations of pairing gap,
total energy, and heat capacity were carried out within a doubly folded
multilevel model as well as realistic nuclei $^{56}$Fe and $^{120}$Sn. The
results obtained show that, under the effect of QNF, in the region of moderate
and strong couplings, the sharp transition between the superconducting and
normal phases is smoothed out, resulting in a thermal pairing gap, which does
not collapse at the BCS critical temperature, but has a tail, which extends to
high temperature. The dynamic coupling of quasiparticles to SCQRPA vibrations
significantly improves the agreement with the results of exact calculations and
those obtained within the finite-temperature quantal Monte Carlo method for the
total energy and heat capacity. It also causes a deviation of the quasiparticle
occupation numbers from the Fermi-Dirac distributions for free fermions.

behavior suggests that the structural evolution with age under a deformation
field, as represented by the dependence of dominant relaxation mode on age,
becomes weaker as the system becomes progressively less homogeneous due to
enhanced attractive interactions caused by addition of salt. Creep-recovery
behavior at same elastic modulus shows more viscous dissipation for a system
having more salt, demonstrating increase in the mechanical fragility. This
study shows that an increase in the concentration of salt, which enhances
attractive interactions and causes greater inhomogeneity, leads to a state
wherein the particles are held together by weaker interactions. This work leads
to important insights into how microstructure affects the ageing dynamics. We
discuss the observed behavior in the context of ageing in colloidal glasses and

the systematic expansion in the shortness of the pulse is extended to the case

For this reason, we present a short introduction to the necessary background.
The method of system realizations of analytic functions often provides new
insights into and interpretations of results relating to the objects under
consideration. In this paper we will use a well-studied topic from classical
analysis as an example. More precisely, we will look at the classical Schur
algorithm from the perspective of System Theory. We will confine our
considerations to rational inner functions. This will allow us to avoid
questions involving limits and will enable us to concentrate on the algebraic
aspects of the problem at hand. Given a non-negative integer (n), we describe
all system realizations of a given rational inner function of degree (n) in
terms of an appropriately constructed equivalence relation in the set of all
unitary ((n + 1) \times (n + 1) )-matrices. The concept of Redheffer coupling
of colligations gives us the possibility to choose a particular representative
from each equivalence class. The Schur algorithm for a rational inner function
is, consequently, described in terms of the state space representation.

density with irreversible aggregation and a time dependent input of particle in
the space dimensions $d=1,2$. For this purpose we use the rate equation
resulting from a generalized mean field approach. A well-known technique for
growing surfaces at the atomic scale is molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Another
approach is the pulsed laser deposition method (PLD). The main difference
between MBE and PLD is that in the case of MBE we have a continuous rate of
deposition $F$ of adatoms on the surface whereas in the case of PLD the adatoms
are deposited during a pulse of a laser which is very short in comparison to
the time span $T$ between the pulses. The generalized mean field theory is a
useful model for both MBE and PLD with the most simple approximation,
point-like island. We show that the parameter $T$ distinguishes the MBE regime
from the PLD regime. We solve the rate equation for the PLD regime. We consider
the time evolution of the density of immobile islands. For large time $t\gg T$,
the PLD regime dominates the MBE regime and we find that the density of
immobile islands grows as $t^{1/2}$ whereas for MBE we find the known behavior
of the density, $t^{1/3}$ for $d=2$ and $t^{1/4}$ for $d=1$. We illustrate this
result with Monte-Carlo simulations for $d=1,2$.

determine its asymptotics, which is identical to the one satisfied by the
linearization. In terms of the rescaled representation, which is a nonlinear
Fokker--Planck equation, the convergence rate turns out to be polynomial in
time. This result is in contrast with the known exponential decay of such
representation for all other values of $m$.

J/psi polarization in the process pp -> J/psi+X has been standing as a puzzle
for a long time. Our early work indicates that if only considering the
color-singlet state, NLO corrections may drastically change the distribution,
but are not sufficient to accommodate the data. The color-octet intermediate
state was suggested to make up the gap. Therefore a direct motivation is to
evaluate if the NLO corrections to the J/psi production via a color-octet can
indeed remedy the problem. Unfortunately, our results show that even the NLO
corrections to both color-singlet and octet states are accounted, the data
cannot be understood yet in the framework of the present theory, but there, as
observed, still a small window remains, namely a P-wave octet might
substantially contribute.

photodisintegration reactions on existing seed nuclei in the so-called ""p

experimental techniques and have to be inferred from statistical
Hauser-Feshbach model calculations. The parametrization of these models has to
be constrained by measurements on stable proton-rich nuclei. A series of

to the respective photodisintegrations, were carried out at the Karlsruhe Van

independently of a specific theory and is encoded in the embedding tensor that

is deformed in an intricate way and in general will only close up to equations

possible? And what is not? If there are no practical limits, what are the

foundations of optics and at connections between optics and other areas of

geometrical ideas normally applied in general relativity and the propagation of

ambient radiation fields also affects their composition. We review the effect
of photo-dissociation interactions on different nuclear species and analyze the
phenomenology of secondary proton production as a function of energy. We show
that, by itself, the UHECR spectrum does not constrain the cosmic-ray

(i.e., as observed at Earth) cannot contain significant amounts of intermediate
mass nuclei (say between He and Si), whatever the source composition, and while
it is vastly proton-dominated when protons are able to reach energies above
$10^{20}$ eV at the source, we show that the propagated composition can be
dominated by Fe and sub-Fe nuclei at the highest energies, either if the
sources are very strongly enriched in Fe nuclei (a rather improbable
situation), or if the accelerated protons have a maximum energy of a few
$10^{19}$ eV at the sources. We also show that in the latter cases, the
expected flux above $3 10^{20}$ eV is very much reduced compared to the case
when protons dominate in this energy range, both at the sources and at Earth.

have used the Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) at 870 micron and the
MAx-Planck Millimeter BOlometer (MAMBO-2) at 1.2 mm to detect the dust ring for
the first time at submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We have constructed
a model of the galaxy to separate the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and dust
ring components. The ring radius at both 870 micron and 1.2 mm agrees well with
the radius determined from optical absorption and atomic gas studies. The
spectral energy distribution of the ring is well fitted by a single grey-body
with dust emissivity index beta=2 and a dust temperature T_d=18.4 K. The dust
mass of the ring is found to be 1.6\pm0.2x10^7Msun which, for a Galactic
gas-to-dust ratio, implies a gas mass that is consistent with measurements from
the literature.

states, were first introduced in the context of high temperature
superconductivity where they were recognized as important example of states
allowing for off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). In this paper we describe
the structure of the correlations present in these states when considered in
their momentum representation and we explore the relations between the quantum
bipartite/multipartite correlations exhibited in k space and the direct lattice
superconducting correlations. In particular, we show how the negativity between
paired momentum modes is directly related to the ODLRO. Moreover, we
investigate the dependence of the block entanglement on the choice of the modes
forming the block and on the ODLRO; consequently we determine the multipartite
content of the entanglement through the evaluation of the generalized ""Meyer
Wallach"" measure in the direct and reciprocal lattice. The determination of the
persistency of entanglement shows how the network of correlations depicted
exhibits a self-similar structure which is robust with respect to ""local""
measurements. Finally, we recognize how a relation between the momentum-space
quantum correlations and the ODLRO can be established even in the case of BCS
states.

observations of the radio galaxy 3C 120 revealing a systematic presence of
gradients in Faraday rotation and degree of polarization across and along the
jet. The degree of polarization increases with distance from the core and
toward the jet edges, and has an asymmetric profile in which the northern side
of the jet is more highly polarized. The Faraday rotation measure is also
stratified across the jet width, with larger values for the southern side. We
find a localized region of high Faraday rotation measure superposed on this
structure between approximately 3 and 4 mas from the core, with a peak of about
6000 rad/m^2. Interaction of the jet with the external medium or a cloud would
explain the confined region of enhanced Faraday rotation, as well as the
stratification in degree of polarization and the flaring of superluminal knots
when crossing this region. The data are also consistent with a helical field in
a two-fluid jet model, consisting of an inner, emitting jet and a sheath
containing nonrelativistic electrons. However, this helical magnetic field
model cannot by itself explain the localized region of enhanced Faraday
rotation. The polarization electric vectors, predominantly perpendicular to the
jet axis once corrected for Faraday rotation, require a dominant component
parallel to the jet axis (in the frame of the emitting plasma) for the magnetic
field in the emitting region.

neighborhood, we need to measure their stellar parameters to high accuracy. We
present a catalogue of accurate stellar parameters for 451 stars that represent
the HARPS Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) ``high precision'' sample.
Spectroscopic stellar parameters were measured using high signal-to-noise (S/N)
spectra acquired with the HARPS spectrograph. The spectroscopic analysis was
completed assuming LTE with a grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and the recent
ARES code for measuring line equivalent widths. We show that our results agree
well with those ones presented in the literature (for stars in common). We
present a useful calibration for the effective temperature as a function of the
index color B-V and [Fe/H]. We use our results to study the metallicity-planet
correlation, namely for very low mass planets. The results presented here
suggest that in contrast to their jovian couterparts, Neptune-like planets do
not form preferentially around metal-rich stars. The ratio of
jupiter-to-neptunes is also an increasing function of stellar metallicity.
These results are discussed in the context of the core-accretion model for
planet formation.

choice is a high granularity sampling calorimeter with tungsten as absorber and
silicon detectors as sensitive material. A ``physics prototype'' has been
constructed, consisting of thirty sensitive layers. Each layer has an active
area of 18x18 cm2 and a pad size of 1x1 cm2. The absorber thickness totals 24
radiation lengths. It has been exposed in 2006 and 2007 to electron and hadron
beams at the DESY and CERN beam test facilities, using a wide range of beam
energies and incidence angles. In this paper, the prototype and the data
acquisition chain are described and a summary of the data taken in the 2006
beam tests is presented. The methods used to subtract the pedestals and
calibrate the detector are detailed. The signal-over-noise ratio has been
measured at 7.63 +/- 0.01. Some electronics features have been observed; these
lead to coherent noise and crosstalk between pads, and also crosstalk between
sensitive and passive areas. The performance achieved in terms of uniformity
and stability is presented.
