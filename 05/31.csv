investigated by a generalization of the Onsager-Machlup (OM) path integral
approach for systems in an equilibrium state (ES). A thermodynamics formally
identical to that in an ES can be formulated, but with definitions of work and
heat as those needed to maintain the NESS. In this approach, the heat plays a
crucial role and is directly related to the different behavior of a system?s
forward and backward paths in time in an appropriate function space. However,
an ambiguity in the choice of the time- backward path corresponding to a given
time-forward path prevents a unique general formal theory for systems in a
NESS. Unique unambiguous physically acceptable physical results for a system in
a NESS appear to be obtainable only after specifying the physical
nonequilibrium parameters, which define a system in a NESS as part of a larger
system. NESS systems are therefore fundamentally different from those in an ES.
Furthermore, an example is given for a particular system that the fluctuations
of a system in a NESS behave in many respects very differently from those in a
system in an ES.

pair-ion-plasmas containing charged dust impurities a thorough discussion is
given of three-component Plasmas. Space-time responses of multi-component
linearized Vlasov plasmas on the basis of multiple integral equations are
invoked. An initial-value problem for Vlasov-Poisson -Ampere equations is
reduced to the one multiple integral equation and the solution is expressed in
terms of forcing function and its space-time convolution with the resolvent
kernel. The forcing function is responsible for the initial disturbance and the
resolvent is responsible for the equilibrium velocity distributions of plasma
species. By use of resolvent equations, time-reversibility, space-reflexivity
and the other symmetries are revealed. The symmetries carry on physical
properties of Vlasov pair plasmas, e.g., conservation laws. Properly choosing
equilibrium distributions for dusty pair plasmas, we can reduce the resolvent
equation to: (i) the undamped dispersive wave equations, (ii) wave-diffusive
transport equation (iii) and diffusive transport equations of oscillations. In
the last case we have to do with anomalous diffusion employing fractional
derivatives in time and space. Fractional diffusion equations account for
typical anomalous features, which are observed in many systems, e.g. in the
case of dispersive transport in amorphous semiconductors, liquid crystals,
polymers, proteins and biosystems.

natural explanation for large mixing angles and economically explain the
distinction between the quark and lepton flavor sectors. We show how to
naturally generate Majorana neutrino masses assuming a gauged a U(1)_{B-L}
symmetry broken in the UV that generates see-saw masses of the right size. This
model requires lepton minimal flavor violation (LMFV) in which only Yukawa
matrices (present on the IR brane) break the flavor symmetries. The
symmetry-breaking is transmitted to charged lepton bulk mass parameters as well
to generate the hierarchy of charged lepton masses. With LMFV, a GIM-like
mechanism prevents dangerous flavor-changing processes for charged leptons and
permits flavor-changing processes only in the presence of the neutrino Yukawa
interaction and are therefore suppressed when the overall scale for the
neutrino Yukawa matrix is slightly smaller than one in units of the curvature.
In this case the theory can be consistent with a cutoff of 10 TeV and 3 TeV
Kaluza-Klein masses.

``squirkonium'' loses energy to radiation before annihilating back into
Standard Model particles. We calculate the branching fractions into various

probably due to synchrotron self-absorption, and become steeper at high

reasonable upper limits could be obtained for polarised intensity. Statistical
comparisons have been made between the spectral index distributions of samples
of BAL and non-BAL QSOs, both in the observed and the rest-frame, finding
steeper spectra among non-BAL QSOs. However constraining this comparison to
compact sources results in no significant differences between both
distributions. This comparison is consistent with BAL QSOs not being oriented

production of three pseudoscalar mesons or a meson and a scalar resonance.
Special attention is paid to final state interactions associated with elastic
meson-meson scattering. The corresponding two-body amplitude is unitarized by
ressumming s-channel diagrams and can be expressed in terms of the usal phase
shifts $\delta$. This procedure preserves the chiral properties of the
amplitude at low-energies. Final state interactions also involve another phase
$\omega$, which describes intermediate two-meson propagation and is
theoretically unambiguous. This phase is absent in the K-matrix approximation.
Partial contributions to the decay amplitude involve a real term, another one
with phase $\delta$ and several others with phases $\delta+\omega$. Our main
result is a simple and almost model independent chiral generalization of the
usual Breit-Wigner expression, suited to be used in analyses of production data

weak lensing observables. In particular, we consider three modified gravity
scenarios: f(R) gravity, the DGP model, and TeVeS theory. Weak lensing is
sensitive to the growth of structure and the relation between matter and
gravitational potentials, both of which will in general be affected by modified
gravity. Restricting ourselves to linear scales, we compare the predictions for
galaxy-shear and shear-shear correlations of each modified gravity cosmology to
those of an effective Dark Energy cosmology with the same expansion history. In
this way, the effects of modified gravity on the growth of perturbations are
separated from the expansion history. We also propose a test which isolates the
matter-potential relation from the growth factor and matter power spectrum. For
all three modified gravity models, the predictions for galaxy and shear
correlations will be discernible from those of Dark Energy with very high
significance in future weak lensing surveys. Furthermore, each model predicts a
measurably distinct scale dependence and redshift evolution of galaxy and shear
correlations, which can be traced back to the physical foundations of each
model. We show that the signal-to-noise for detecting signatures of modified
gravity is much higher for weak lensing observables as compared to the ISW
effect, measured via the galaxy-CMB cross-correlation.

shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ in the range from $1/4\pi$ up
to $1/\pi$, finding that the $v_2$ saturation value varies by about a factor 2.
Scaling of $v_2(p_T)/\epsilon_x$ is seen also for finite $\eta/s$ which
indicates that it does not prove a perfect hydrodynamical behavior, but is
compatible with a plasma at finite $\eta/s$. Introducing a suitable freeze-out
condition, we see a significant reduction of $v_2(p_T)$ especially at
intermediate $p_T$ and for more peripheral collisions. This causes a breaking
of the scaling for both $v_2(p_T)$ and the $p_T-$averaged $v_2$, while keeping
the scaling of $v_2(p_T)/\la v_2\ra$. This is in better agreement with the
experimental observations and shows as a first indication that the $\eta/s$
should be significantly lower than the pQCD estimates. We finally point out the
necessity to include the hadronization via coalescence for a definite
evaluation of $\eta/s$ from intermediate $p_T$ data.

suggest instead that a dust-free cavity was produced in the magnetar

Considering the total energy released in the flare, the theoretical
dust--destruction radius matches well with the observed dimensions of the ring.
We conclude that SGR 1900+14 is unambiguously associated with a cluster of
massive stars, thereby solidifying the link between magnetars and massive

some work of Levi in 1942. In the 1960's Richard J. Thompson created a group F

ALL instances of the associative law, and also showed that many non-solvable

observers just outside the horizon measure an invariantly redshifted
temperature, diverging at the horizon itself. In static, asymptotically flat
cases, the Hawking temperature as usually defined by the Killing vector agrees
in standard cases, but generally differs by a relative redshift factor between
the horizon and infinity, being the temperature measured by static observers at
infinity. Likewise, the geometrical surface gravity reduces to the Newtonian
surface gravity in the Newtonian limit, while the Killing definition instead
reflects measurements at infinity. This may resolve a longstanding puzzle
concerning the Hawking temperature for the extremal limit of the charged
stringy black hole, namely that it is the local temperature which vanishes. In
general, this confirms the quasi-stationary picture of black-hole evaporation
in early stages. However, the geometrical surface gravity is generally not the

effect have focused on steady-state generation and time-averaged detection,
without directly addressing the accumulation dynamics on the timescale of the
spin coherence time. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved measurement of the
dynamics of spin accumulation generated by the extrinsic spin Hall effect in a
doped GaAs semiconductor channel. Using electrically-pumped time-resolved Kerr
rotation, we image the accumulation, precession, and decay dynamics near the
channel boundary with spatial and temporal resolution and identify multiple
evolution time constants. We model these processes using time-dependent
diffusion analysis utilizing both exact and numerical solution techniques and
find that the underlying physical spin coherence time differs from the

in microlensing event MOA-2007-BLG-192. The best fit microlensing model shows
both the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can be
combined to obtain the lens masses of M = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) M_sun for the
primary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) M_earth for the planet. However, the
observational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, and
the radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source star
color measurement. As a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finite
source measurements are weak. Nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signal
clearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finite
source effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. Adaptive optics
images taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) NACO instrument are consistent
with a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of the
main sequence. Follow-up VLT and/or Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations
will either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-mass
lens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. In either case, the
lens star, MOA-2007-BLG-192L, is the lowest mass primary known to have a
companion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, is

spherical spin glass model with short range, random interactions. Since the
model allows for rigorous detailed calculations, we can show how the effective
partition function calculated with help of the replica method for the spin
glass fluctuating fields separates into a mean field contribution for the
replica diagonal fields and a strictly short range partition function for the
replica off-diagonal fields. The mean field part coincides with previous
results. The short range part describes a phase transition in a Q^3-field
theory, where the fluctuating fields depend on a space variable and two
independent time variables.This we analyze using the renormalization group with
dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction of dimensional poles. By
generalizing standard field theory methods to our particular situation, we can
identify the critical dimensionality as d_c = 5 at very low temperatures due to
the dimensionality shift D_c = d_c + 1. we then perform a \epsilon' expansion
to order one loop to calculate the critical exponents by solving the
renormalization group equations.

$N_{\rm obs}\lesssim 60$, leading to a suppression of the number of nearly
circular orbits. Assuming intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters, we
generate a large number of mock RV data sets and study the selection effect on
the eccentricity distribution. We find the overall detection efficiency only
mildly decreases with eccentricity. This is because although high eccentricity
orbits are more difficult to sample, they also have larger RV amplitudes for
fixed planet mass and orbital semi-major axis. Thus the primary source of
uncertainties in the eccentricity distribution comes from biases in Keplerian
fits to detections with low-amplitude and/or small $N_{\rm obs}$, rather than
from selection effects. Our results suggest that the abundance of

traveling at hypersonic velocities. Structure within jet beams is often
attributed to periodic or ``pulsed'' variations of conditions at the jet
source. Simulations based on this scenario result in knots extending across the
jet diameter. Observations and recent high energy density laboratory
experiments shed new light on structures below this scale and indicate they may
be important for understanding the fundamentals of jet dynamics. In this paper
we offer an alternative to ``pulsed'' models of protostellar jets. Using direct
numerical simulations we explore the possibility that jets are chains of
sub-radial clumps propagating through a moving inter-clump medium. Our models
explore an idealization of this scenario by injecting small ($r<r_{jet}$),
dense ($\rho>\rho_{jet}$) spheres embedded in an otherwise smooth inter-clump
jet flow. The spheres are initialized with velocities differing from the jet
velocity by $\sim15$%. We find the consequences of shifting from homogeneous to
heterogeneous flows are significant as clumps interact with each other and with
the inter-clump medium in a variety of ways. Structures which mimic what is
expected from pulsed-jet models can form, as can previously unseen
``sub-radial'' behaviors including backward facing bow shocks and off-axis
working surfaces. While these small-scale structures have not been seen before
in simulation studies, they are found in high resolution jet observations. We
discuss implications of our simulations for the interpretation of protostellar
jets with regard to characterization of knots by a ``lifetime'' or ``velocity
history'' approach as well as linking observed structures with central engines
which produce the jets.

first proof was given by Andr\'e Weil in 1942. This proof uses the intersection
of divisors on $\C\times\C$, making the application to the original Riemann
hypothesis so far unsuccessful, because $\spec\Z\times\spec\Z=\spec\Z$ is
one-dimensional. A new method of proof was found in 1969 by S. A. Stepanov.
This method was greatly simplified and generalized by Bombieri in 1973.
  Bombieri's method uses functions on $\C\times\C$, again precluding a direct
translation to a proof of the original Riemann hypothesis. However, the two
coordinates on $\C\times\C$ have different roles, one coordinate playing the
geometric role of the variable of a polynomial, and the other coordinate the
arithmetic role of the coefficients of this polynomial. The Frobenius
automorphism of $\C$ acts on the geometric coordinate of $\C\times\C$. In the

seen to increase with the Reynolds number ($R$) up to a distance of almost 20
body scales. This increase levels up to a Reynolds number close to the critical
value for the onset of the first instability. The entrainment is observed to be
almost extinguished at a distance which is nearly the same for all the steady
wakes within the $R$ range here considered, i.e. [20-100], which indicates that
supercritical steady wakes have the same entrainment length as the subcritical

indicated by a large compilation of experimental results. {\it A fortiori} of
these findings, we propose to interpret the unsteady bifurcation as a process
that allows a smooth increase-redistribution of the entrainment along the wake

imposed on a free shear flow is considered. The viscous perturbation equations
are then combined in terms of the vorticity and velocity, and are solved by
means of a combined Laplace-Fourier transform in the plane normal to the basic
flow. This treatment allows for a simplification of the governing equations
such that it is possible to observe long transients, that can last hundreds
time scales. This result would not be possible over an acceptable lapse of time
by carrying out a direct numerical integration of the linearized Navier-Stokes
equations. The exploration is done with respect to physical inputs as the angle
of obliquity, the symmetry of the perturbation and the streamwise damping rate.
The base flow is an intermediate section of the growing 2D circular cylinder
wake where the entrainment process is still active. Two Reynolds numbers of the
order of the critical value for the onset of the first instability are
considered. The early transient evolution offers very different scenarios for
which we present a summary for particular cases. For example, for amplified
perturbations, we have observed two kinds of transients, namely (1) a monotone
amplification and (2) a sequence of growth - decrease - final growth. In the
latter case, if the initial condition is an asymmetric oblique or longitudinal
perturbation, the transient clearly shows an initial oscillatory time scale.
Furthermore, the more a perturbation is longitudinally confined the more it is
amplified in time. The long-term behavior of two-dimensional disturbances shows
excellent agreement with a recent two-dimensional spatio-temporal multiscale
modal analysis and with laboratory data concerning the frequency and wave
length of the parallel vortex shedding in the cylinder wake.

resolution angle-integrated photoemission spectroscopy. The density-of-states
suppression is observed with decreasing temperature in all samples, revealing
two characteristic energy scales (10meV and 80meV). However, no obvious doping
dependence is observed. We argue that the 10meV suppression is due to an
anomalously doping-independent normal state pseudogap, which becomes the
superconducting gap once in the superconducting state; and alert the
possibility that the 80meV-scale suppression might be an artifact of the
polycrystalline samples.

  Balance","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027532",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use the idea of dependence balance to obtain a new outer bound for the
capacity region of the discrete memoryless multiple access channel with
noiseless feedback (MAC-FB). We consider a binary additive noisy MAC-FB whose
feedback capacity is not known. The binary additive noisy MAC considered in
this paper can be viewed as the discrete counterpart of the Gaussian MAC-FB.
Ozarow established that the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian MAC-FB is
given by the cut-set bound. Our result shows that for the discrete version of
the channel considered by Ozarow, this is not the case. Direct evaluation of
our outer bound is intractable due to an involved auxiliary random variable
whose large cardinality prohibits an exhaustive search. We overcome this
difficulty by using functional analysis to explicitly evaluate our outer bound.
Our outer bound is strictly less than the cut-set bound at all points on the
capacity region where feedback increases capacity. In addition, we explicitly
evaluate the Cover-Leung achievable rate region for the binary additive noisy
MAC-FB in consideration. Furthermore, using the tools developed for the
evaluation of our outer bound, we also explicitly characterize the boundary of
the feedback capacity region of the binary erasure MAC, for which the
Cover-Leung achievable rate region is known to be tight. This last result
confirms that the feedback strategies developed by Kramer for the binary
erasure MAC are capacity achieving.

Lev, are systems which in addition to the standard axioms and structural rules
have only logical rules in which exactly one occurrence of a connective is
introduced and no other connective is mentioned. A constructive coherence
criterion for the non-triviality of such systems was defined and it was shown
that a system of this kind admits cut-elimination iff it is coherent. The
semantics of such systems is provided using two-valued non-deterministic
matrices (2Nmatrices). In 2005 Zamansky and Avron extended these results to
systems with unary quantifiers of a very restricted form. In this paper we
substantially extend the characterization of canonical systems to (n,k)-ary
quantifiers, which bind k distinct variables and connect n formulas, and show
that the coherence criterion remains constructive for such systems. Then we
focus on the case of k&#8712;{0,1} and for a canonical calculus G show that it
is coherent precisely when it has a strongly characteristic 2Nmatrix, which in
turn is equivalent to admitting strong cut-elimination.

the Enskog equation with an external force. Since the collision operator of the
Enskog equation is more complicated than that of the Boltzmann equation, these
hypotheses are more complicated than those given by Duan et al. for the
Boltzmann equation. The hypotheses are very related to collision of particles
of moderately or highly dense gases along the bicharacteristic curves and they
can be used to make the estimation of the so-called gain and loss integrals of
the Enskog integral equation. Then, by controlling these integrals, we show the
existence and uniqueness of the global mild solution to the Enskog equation in
an infinite vacuum for moderately or highly dense gases. Finally, we make some
remarks on the locally Lipschitz assumption of the collision factors in the
Enskog equation.

and discrete Wigner representations. We also emphasise the special role played
by Bell states in this approach and propose a new protocol for Quantum Key
