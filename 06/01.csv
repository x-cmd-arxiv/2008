constant mass-to-light ratio M/L and (ii) a velocity ellipsoid that is aligned
with cylindrical coordinates (R,z) and characterized by the classic anisotropy
parameter beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_R^2. Our simple models are fit to SAURON
integral-field observations of the stellar kinematics for a set of fast-rotator

the models generally provide remarkably good descriptions of the shape of the
first (V) and second (V_rms=sqrt{V^2+sigma^2}) velocity moments, once a
detailed description of the surface brightness is given. This is consistent
with previous findings on the simple dynamical structure of these objects. With
the observationally-motivated assumption that beta_z>0, the method is able to
recover the inclination. The technique can be used to determine the dynamical
mass-to-light ratios and angular momenta of early-type fast-rotators and spiral
galaxies, especially when the quality of the data does not justify more
sophisticated modeling approaches. This formalism allows for the inclusion of
dark matter, supermassive black holes, spatially varying anisotropy, and

increased CoP displacements along the antero-posterior axis in the fatigue than

dilute magnetic semiconductors. For this purpose, we present results on the
Haldane-Anderson model of transition-metal impurities in a semiconductor host,
which were obtained by using the Hirsch-Fye Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
algorithm. In particular, we present results on the impurity-impurity and
impurity-host magnetic correlations in two and three-dimensional semiconductors
with quadratic band dispersions. In addition, we use the tight-binding
approximation with experimentally-determined parameters to obtain the host band
structure and the impurity-host hybridization for Mn impurities in GaAs. When
the chemical potential is located between the top of the valence band and the
impurity bound state (IBS), the impurities exhibit ferromagnetic (FM)
correlations with the longest range. We show that these FM correlations are
generated by the antiferromagnetic coupling of the host electronic spins to the
impurity magnetic moment. Finally, we obtain an IBS energy of 100 meV, which is
consistent with the experimental value of 110 meV, by combining the QMC
technique with the tight-binding approach for a Mn impurity in GaAs.

determined by the many-body bath evolution. We develop a cluster-correlation
expansion (CCE) theory for the spin bath dynamics relevant to the qubit
decoherence problem. A cluster correlation term is recursively defined as the
evolution of a group of bath spins divided by the cluster correlations of all
the subgroups. The so-defined correlation accounts for the authentic collective
excitations within a given group. The bath propagator is the product of all
possible cluster correlation terms. For a finite-time evolution as in the qubit
decoherence problem, a convergent result can be obtained by truncating the
expansion up to a certain cluster size. The two-spin cluster truncation of the
CCE corresponds to the pair-correlation approximation [PRB 74,195301(2006)]. In
terms of the standard linked cluster expansion, a cluster correlation term is
the infinite summation of all the connected diagrams with all and only the
spins in the group flip-flopped, and thus the expansion is exact whenever
converges. When the individual contribution of each higher-order correlation
term to the decoherence is small, as the usual case for relatively large baths
where the decoherence could complete well within the bath spin flip-flop time,
the CCE coincides with the cluster expansion [PRB 74,035322(2006)]. For small
baths, however, the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin
flip-flop timescale and thus individual higher-order cluster correlations could
grow significant. In such cases, only the CCE converges to the exact coherent
dynamics of multi-spin clusters. We check the accuracy of the CCE in an exactly
solvable spin-chain model.

discern the biological complexity transition and to evaluate the critical role

calculate the time of the Cambrian explosion by an innovative and accurate

the Cambrian explosion. A general formula for evaluating genome size of
different species has been found, by which major questions of the C-value
enigma can be solved and the genome size evolution can be illustrated. The
Cambrian explosion is essentially a major transition of biological complexity,
which corresponds to a turning point in genome size evolution. The observed
maximum prokaryotic complexity is just a relic of the Cambrian explosion and it
is supervised by the maximum information storage capability in the observed
universe. Our results open a new prospect of studying metazoan origins and

Sensors gather information about the state of physical world. Actuators react
to this information by performing appropriate actions. WSANs thus enable cyber
systems to monitor and manipulate the behavior of the physical world. WSANs are
growing at a tremendous pace, just like the exploding evolution of Internet.
Supporting quality of service (QoS) will be of critical importance for
pervasive WSANs that serve as the network infrastructure of diverse

this paper examines and discusses the requirements, critical challenges, and

was recently discovered that the sparsity pattern of the Lasso estimator can
only be asymptotically identical to the true sparsity pattern if the design

can easily be violated in the presence of highly correlated variables. Here we
examine the behavior of the Lasso estimators if the irrepresentable condition

dynamics of repeated interaction quantum systems in a deterministic and random
framework. We describe the non equilibrium steady states (NESS) such systems
display and we present, as a macroscopic consequence, a second law of
thermodynamics these NESS give rise to. We also explain in some details the
analysis of products of certain random matrices underlying this dynamical
problem.

of the embedding of flavor D-brane probes in HQCD models. The models we
consider include a generalization of the Sakai Sugimoto model at zero
temperature and at the ""high-temperature intermediate phase"", where the system
is in a deconfining phase while admitting chiral symmetry breaking and a
non-critical 6d model at zero temperature. All these models are based on
backgrounds associated with near extremal N_c D4 branes and a set of N_f<<N_c
flavor probe branes that admit geometrical chiral symmetry breaking. We point
out that the spectra of these models include a 0^{--} branch which does not
show up in nature.
  At zero temperature we found that the masses of the mesons M_n depend on the
""constituent quark mass"" parameter m^c_q and on the excitation number n as
M_n^2 m^c_q and M^2_n n^{1.7} for the ten dimensional case and as M_n m^c_q and
M_n n^{0.75} in the non-critical case. At the high temperature intermediate
phase we detect a decrease of the masses of low spin mesons as a function of
the temperature similar to holographic vector mesons and to lattice
calculations.

It implies that under physically
reasonable conditions, spacetimes which are free from singularities are
necessarily stably causal and hence admit a time function. Read as a
singularity theorem it states that if there is some form of causality violation
on spacetime then either it is the worst possible, namely violation of
chronology, or there is a singularity. The analogous result: ""Non-totally
vicious spacetimes without lightlike rays are globally hyperbolic"" is also
proved, and its physical consequences are explored.
