conditions. Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation, which were
ignored in the calculation of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser & Szalay (1986), are
included in our analysis. These functions exhibit large oscillations around the
sound horizon scale for generic CDM power spectra. We derive the exact
leading-order expression for the correlation of density peaks and demonstrate
the contribution of those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that
these functions can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of
density maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends
upon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size, and the
small-scale behaviour of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM cosmology, for
maxima identified in the density field smoothed at mass scale M\approx
10^{12}-10^{14}M_sun/h and with linear threshold height \nu=1.673/\sigma(M),
the contrast of the BAO can be a few tens of percent larger than in the linear
matter correlation. Overall, the BAO is amplified (damped) for threshold
heights larger (less) than unity. Density maxima thus behave quite differently
than linearly biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is
a simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation. We also
calculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasi-linear regime. We show
that the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise velocity of density
peaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local biasing relation involving
gradients of the density field. Biasing will be an important issue in
ascertaining how much of the enhancement of the BAO in the primeval correlation
of density maxima propagates into the late-time clustering of galaxies.

subsequent top decay products are not isolated. For hadronic boosted tops, we
consider variables which probe the jet substructure in order to reduce the
background from QCD jets with large invariant mass. Substructure variables
related to two-body kinematics are least sensitive to the modeling of parton
shower, while those which involve multi-body kinematics may still have
discrimination power. For leptonic boosted tops, we consider variables which
characterize the separation between the lepton--although not isolated by
conventional criterion--and the hadronic activity in the top jet. Such
variables are useful in reducing the backgrounds both from heavy-flavor jets
and from accidental jet-lepton overlap. We give numerical estimates of the top
identification efficiency versus background rejection rate as a functions of
cuts on these variables, and find that these variables offer additional useful
information above invariant mass alone.

Adopting a bottom up
approach, the assumption that the dynamics of the GUT model can in principle
decouple from Planck scale physics leads to a surprisingly predictive
framework. An internal U(1) hypercharge flux Higgses the GUT group directly to
the MSSM or to a flipped GUT model, a mechanism unavailable in heterotic
models. This new ingredient automatically addresses a number of puzzles present
in traditional GUT models. The internal U(1) hyperflux allows us to solve the
doublet-triplet splitting problem, and explains the qualitative features of the
distorted GUT mass relations for lighter generations due to the Aharanov-Bohm
effect. These models typically come with nearly exact global symmetries which
prevent bare mu terms and also forbid dangerous baryon number violating
operators. Strong curvature around our brane leads to a repulsion mechanism for
Landau wave functions for neutral fields. This leads to large hierarchies of
the form exp(-c/B^(2*g)) where c and g are order one parameters and B ~
M_(GUT)/(M_(pl)*alpha_(GUT)). This effect can simultaneously generate a viably
small mu term as well as an acceptable Dirac neutrino mass on the order of 0.5
* 10^(-2 +/- 0.5) eV. In another scenario, we find a modified seesaw mechanism
which predicts that the light neutrinos have masses in the expected range while
the Majorana mass term for the heavy neutrinos is ~ 3 * 10^(12 +/- 1.5) GeV.
Communicating supersymmetry breaking to the MSSM can be elegantly realized
through gauge mediation. In one scenario, the same repulsion mechanism also
leads to messenger masses which are naturally much lighter than the GUT scale.

thermoviscous Newtonian fluid, and includes nonlinear terms up to second order,
is proposed. In contrast to the model known as the Kuznetsov equation, the
proposed nonlinear wave equation preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the
fundamental fluid dynamical equations in the non-dissipative limit. An exact
traveling front solution is obtained from a generalized traveling wave
assumption. This solution is, in an overall sense, equivalent to the Taylor
shock solution of the Burgers equation. However, in contrast to the Burgers
equation, the model equation considered here is capable to describe waves
propagating in opposite directions. Owing to the Hamiltonian structure of the
proposed model equation, the front solution is in agreement with the classical
Rankine-Hugoniot relations. The exact front solution propagates at supersonic
speed with respect to the fluid ahead of it, and subsonic speed with respect to
the fluid behind it, similarly to the fluid dynamical shock. Linear stability
analysis reveals that the front is stable when the acoustic pressure belongs to
a critical interval, and is otherwise unstable. These results are verified
numerically. Studies of head-on colliding fronts demonstrate that the front
propagation speed changes upon collision.

the observed variability of the H alpha line of Arp 102B and 3C 390.3. We find
that spots need to be concentrated in the outer parts of the line emitting
region to reproduce the observed variability properties for Arp 102B. This
rules out spot production by star/disk collisions and favors a scenario where
the radius of marginal self-gravity is within the line emitting region,
creating a sharp increase in the radial spot distribution in the outer parts.

associated to the auxiliary measurement of external vibrations, can be operated
beyond its linear range and still keep a high acceleration sensitivity. We
propose and compare two measurement procedures (fringe fitting and nonlinear
lock) that can be used to extract the mean phase of the interferometer when the
interferometer phase fluctuations exceed $2\pi$. Despite operating in the urban
environment of inner Paris without any vibration isolation, the use of a low
noise seismometer for the measurement of ground vibrations allows our atom
gravimeter to reach at night a sensitivity as good as $5.5\times10^{-8}$g at 1
s. Robustness of the measurement to large vibration noise is also demonstrated
by the ability of our gravimeter to operate during an earthquake with excellent
sensitivity. Our high repetition rate allows for recovering the true low
frequency seismic vibrations, ensuring proper averaging. Such techniques open
new perspectives for applications in other fields, such as navigation and
geophysics.

Newtonian framework can be extended to all speeds. For this aim, it is
formulated the concept of actor scenario vs. observer scenario. This
differentiation is essential to avoid confusion between effective reality
(actor scenario) and appearance (observer scenario). Measurements are subjected
to kinematical aberrations, the observer scenario being inertial. These must be
removed to attain intrinsic reality, i.e. that of actors. The lack of

amended Newtonian mechanics is of full application. Here, it has been mainly
applied to the Newtonian Doppler effect, amended to suit all speeds.

of detailed balance in nonequilibrium processes. It is an approach based on
another known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by
Darwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,
has been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics
and thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an
awkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we
present from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between
thermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show
that the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,
hence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative
entropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without
detailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system. In
particular, the dynamical component responsible for breaking detailed balance
condition does not contribute to the change of the relative entropy. Two types
of stochastic dynamical equalities of current interest are explicitly discussed
in the present approach: One is based on Feynman-Kac formula and another is a
generalization of Einstein relation. Both are directly accessible to
experimental tests. Our demonstration indicates that Darwinian dynamics
represents logically a simple and straightforward starting point for
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics and is complementary to and consistent
with conservative dynamics that dominates the physical sciences. Present
exploration suggests the existence of a unified stochastic dynamical framework
both near and far from equilibrium.

astronomical images can be obtained from second-order correlations only when a
priory information is used about the object. The third-order intensity
correlations contain information about the Fourier phase and need no such
assumptions. In the ordinary way we can make measurements of the second-order
intensity correlations with an intensity interferometer. We can also calculate
the third-order intensity correlations from the data set of measured
intensities for each distance triplet. After that we can reconstruct the
Fourier phase from third-order correlations by using bipectral technique. When
this is combining with the Fourier magnitude obtained from the second-order
intensity correlations, we have the ultimate Fourier transform of the source
brightness distribution. An inverse Fourier transform recovers the source

asteroseismic observations as complementary constraints and to determine the
fundamental parameters of the star. Additionally, we propose a new quantity to
lift the degeneracy between the initial chemical composition and stellar age.
Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC7), we construct a series of stellar
evolutionary tracks for the mass range $M$ = 0.85 -- 0.93 $M_{\odot}$ with
different composition $Y_{i}$ (0.26 -- 0.30) and $Z_{i}$ (0.017 -- 0.023).
Along these tracks, we select a grid of stellar model candidates that fall
within the error box in the HR diagram to calculate the theoretical
frequencies, the large- and small- frequency separations using the Guenther's
stellar pulsation code. Following the asymptotic formula of stellar $p$-modes,
we define a quantity $r_{01}$ which is correlated with stellar age. Also, we
test it by theoretical adiabatic frequencies of many models. Many detailed
models of 70 Ophiuchi A have been listed in Table 3. By combining all
non-asteroseismic observations available for 70 Ophiuchi A with these
seismological data, we think that Model 60, Model 125 and Model 126, listed in
Table 3, are the optimum models presently. Meanwhile, we predict that the
radius of this star is about 0.860 -- 0.865 $R_{\odot}$ and the age is about

laser via four-wave mixing is demonstrated. Radio frequency outcoupling is used
to extract atoms from a Bose Einstein condensate near the center of the
condensate and initiate scattering between trapped and untrapped atoms. The
unequal strengths of the interactions for different internal states allows an
energy-momentum resonance which leads to the creation of pairs of atoms
scattered from the zero-velocity condensate. The resulting scattered beams are
well separated from the main atom laser in the 2-dimensional transverse atom
laser profile. Numerical simulations of the system are in good agreement with
the observed atom laser spatial profiles, and indicate that the scattered beams
are generated by a four-wave mixing process, suggesting that the beams are
correlated.

The CO emission peaks around the two merger nuclei with a velocity signature of
gas rotation around each nucleus, and is also detected in a kpc-size disk
encompassing the binary nucleus. The dust continuum, in contrast, is mostly
from the two nuclei. The beam-averaged brightness temperature of both line and
continuum emission exceeds 50 K at and around the nuclei, revealing the
presence of warm molecular gas and dust. The dust emission morphologically
agrees with the distribution of radio supernova features in the east nucleus,
as expected when a starburst heats the nucleus. In the brighter west nucleus,
however, the submillimeter dust emission is more compact than the supernova
distribution. The 860 micron core, after deconvolution, has a size of 50-80 pc,
consistent with recent 1.3 mm observations, and a peak brightness temperature
of (0.9-1.6)x10^2 K. Its bolometric luminosity is at least 2x10^{11} Lsun and
could be ~10^{12} Lsun depending on source structure and 860 micron opacity,
which we estimate to be of the order of tau_{860} ~ 1 (i.e., N_{H_2} ~ 10^{25}

stellar parameters and internal structure. Several frequency combinations are
largely used for comparisons between models and observations. In particular,
the ``small separations'' are very sensitive to stellar cores. We showed in a
previous paper that they can change sign, in contradiction with the
``asymptotic theory'', and that this behaviour could correspond to signatures
of convective and/or helium cores. Here we analyse this behaviour in detail by
systematic modelling during stellar evolution. We computed evolutionary tracks
for models with various masses (from 1.05 to 1.25 Msun) and various chemical
composition, with and without overshooting. We computed the adiabatic
oscillation frequencies of the models and analysed the evolution of their small
separations along an evolutionary track. We found that, for all cases, the
stars go through a stage, during their evolution time, where the small
separations computed between degrees l=0 and l=2 become negative in the
observed range of frequencies. This behaviour is clearly related to the
signature of a helium-rich core. We discuss the consequences for the

'jet-quenching', is currently attributed to partonic energy loss in the hot
medium created in the collision. The RHIC experiments show that at large enough
p_T, hadron quenching is strong, and of similar magnitude for light and heavy
flavours. This point is difficult to understand in a parton energy loss
scenario, where the energy loss is believed to be dominantly radiative, and
quantitatively different for light partons and heavy quarks: gluon radiation
off a heavy quark is suppressed at small angles - within the so-called dead
cone - and a heavy quark suffers less radiative energy loss than a light
parton. In this context it is important to reconsider the collisional
contribution to partonic energy loss. Although it seems difficult to see how
collisional losses could substantially increase heavy flavour quenching without
simultaneously increasing light hadron quenching, it is theoretically important
to establish correct results for the heavy quark collisional energy loss.

microscopic vortex rings -- which, together with phonons, are thermal
excitations of He II -- forms in the second-sound standing halfwave. This flux
partially orders the chaotically oriented dipole moments of the atoms, which
results in volume polarization of He II. The observed electric induction can be
explained theoretically under the assumption that each vortex ring possesses a
dipole moment of the order of ten atomic moments. It is shown also that the
theoretical value of the voltage U induced in He II by the volume system of
dipoles strongly depends on the dimensions of the resonator for dipoles of any
origin. The experimental value of U is the same for two resonators of different
size; therefore, this voltage may be not connected with the volume polarization
of He II.

searching for similar phenomenon in other compounds. With the exception of MgB2

breakthrough has been made in a new class of oxypnictide compounds. Following
the initial discovery of superconductivity in LaO1-x FxFeAs (Tc =26 K), Tc
onset has been raised to 55 K in ReO1-xFxFeAs (Re: Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm). Meanwhile,
unravelling the nature of the energy associated with the formation of

finding superconductors with still higher Tc. Here we show that, on the basis
of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in PrO0.89F0.11FeAs (Tc
=45 K), the Cooper pair is in the spin-singlet state (two spins are
anti-paralleled), with two energy gaps opening below Tc. The results strongly
suggest the existence of nodes (zeros) in the gap. None of superconductors

superconductor, which spontaneously breaks baryon number and chiral symmetry.
Its low-energy thermodynamic and transport properties are therefore dominated
by the H (superfluid) boson, and the octet of pseudoscalar pseudo-Goldstone
bosons of which the neutral kaon is the lightest. We study the CFL-K^0 phase,
in which the stress induced by the strange quark mass causes the kaons to
condense, and there is an additional ultra-light ""K^0"" Goldstone boson arising
from the spontaneous breaking of isospin. We compute the bulk viscosity of
matter in the CFL-K^0 phase, which arises from the beta-equilibration processes
K^0<->H+H and K^0+H<->H. We find that the bulk viscosity varies as T^7, unlike
the CFL phase where it is exponentially Boltzmann-suppressed by the kaon's
energy gap. However, in the temperature range of relevance for r-mode damping
in compact stars, the bulk viscosity in the CFL-K^0 phase turns out to be even
smaller than in the uncondensed CFL phase, which already has a bulk viscosity
much smaller than all other known color-superconducting quark phases.

unresolved binarity and Malmquist bias, we estimate that there are 17+-4 >=T4

exponent alpha between -1.0 and 0. This is consistent with the latest
2MASS/SDSS constraint (which is based on lower number statistics), and is
significantly lower than the alpha~1.0 suggested by L dwarf field populations,
possibly a result of the lower mass range probed by the T dwarf class.

the development and installation of a silicon tracker and fast-timing detectors
in the LHC tunnel at 420 m from the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS
experiments. These detectors would measure precisely very forward protons in
conjunction with the corresponding central detectors as a means to study
Standard Model (SM) physics, and to search for and characterise New Physics
signals. This report includes a detailed description of the physics case for
the detector and, in particular, for the measurement of Central Exclusive
Production, pp --> p + phi + p, in which the outgoing protons remain intact and
the central system phi may be a single particle such as a SM or MSSM Higgs
boson. Other physics topics discussed are gamma-gamma and gamma-p interactions,
and diffractive processes. The report includes a detailed study of the trigger
strategy, acceptance, reconstruction efficiencies, and expected yields for a
particular p p --> p H p measurement with Higgs boson decay in the b-bbar mode.
The document also describes the detector acceptance as given by the LHC beam
optics between the interaction points and the FP420 location, the machine
backgrounds, the new proposed connection cryostat and the moving (""Hamburg"")
beam-pipe at 420 m, and the radio-frequency impact of the design on the LHC.
The last part of the document is devoted to a description of the 3D silicon
sensors and associated tracking performances, the design of two fast-timing
detectors capable of accurate vertex reconstruction for background rejection at
high-luminosities, and the detector alignment and calibration strategy.

Chromodynamics (pQCD) shower developing after a hard process embedded in a
heavy-ion collision. The main assumption is that the cascade of branching
partons traverses a medium which (consistent with standard radiative energy
loss pictures) is characterized by a local transport coefficient qhat which
measures the virtuality per unit length transferred to a parton which
propagates in this medium. This increase in parton virtuality alters the
development of the shower and in essence leads to extra induced radiation and
hence a softening of the momentum distribution in the shower. After
hadronization, this leads to the concept of a medium-modified fragmentation
function. On the level of observables, this is manifest as the suppression of
high transverse momentum (PT) hadron spectra. We simulate the soft medium
created in heavy-ion collisions by a 3-d hydrodynamical evolution and average
the medium-modified fragmentation function over this evolution in order to
compare with data on single inclusive hadron suppression and extract the qhat
which characterizes the medium. Finally, we discuss possible uncertainties of
the model formulation and argue that the data in a soft momentum show evidence
of qualitatively different physics which presumably cannot be described by a
medium-modified parton shower.

abelian group with $n_1|n_2|...|n_r$. A conjecture of Hamidoune says that if
$W=w_1... w_n$ is a sequence of integers, all but at most one relatively prime
to $|G|$, and $S$ is a sequence over $G$ with $|S|\geq |W|+|G|-1\geq |G|+1$,
the maximum multiplicity of $S$ at most $|W|$, and $\sigma(W)\equiv 0\mod |G|$,
then there exists a nontrivial subgroup $H$ such that every element $g\in H$
can be represented as a weighted subsequence sum of the form
$g=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_is_i$, with $s_1... s_n$ a subsequence of $S$. We give two
examples showing this does not hold in general, and characterize the
counterexamples for large $|W|\geq {1/2}|G|$.
  A theorem of Gao, generalizing an older result of Olson, says that if $G$ is
a finite abelian group, and $S$ is a sequence over $G$ with $|S|\geq
|G|+D(G)-1$, then either every element of $G$ can be represented as a
$|G|$-term subsequence sum from $S$, or there exists a coset $g+H$ such that
all but at most $|G/H|-2$ terms of $S$ are from $g+H$. We establish some very
special cases in a weighted analog of this theorem conjectured by Ordaz and
Quiroz, and some partial conclusions in the remaining cases, which imply a
recent result of Ordaz and Quiroz. This is done, in part, by extending a
weighted setpartition theorem of Grynkiewicz, which we then use to also improve
the previously mentioned result of Gao by showing that the hypothesis $|S|\geq
|G|+D(G)-1$ can be relaxed to $|S|\geq |G|+d^*(G)$, where
$d^*(G)=\Sum_{i=1}^{r}(n_i-1)$. We also use this method to derive a variation
on Hamidoune's conjecture valid when at least $d^*(G)$ of the $w_i$ are
relatively prime to $|G|$.

each other and result in a coherence scale, which is independent of alloy

subsystems and the central region of the outer one are homogeneous, the last
surrounded by an isothermal homeoid. The virial equations are explicitly
written under additional restrictions. An application is made to hole + vortex
+ bulge systems, in the limit of flattened inner subsystems. Using the
Faber-Jackson relation, the standard $M_{\rm H}$-$\sigma_0$ form is deduced
from qualitative considerations. The projected bulge velocity dispersion to
projected vortex velocity ratio, $\eta$, as a function of the fractional
radius, y_{\rm BV}, and the fractional masses, $m_{\rm BH}$, and $m_{\rm VH}$,
is plotted for several cases. It is shown that a fixed value of $\eta$ below
the maximum corresponds to two different configurations: a compact bulge on the
left and an extended bulge on the right. In addition, for fixed $m_{\rm BH}$ or
$m_{\rm BV}$, and $y_{\rm BV}$, more massive bulges are related to larger
$\eta$ and vice versa. The model is applied to NGC 4374 and NGC 4486, and the
bulge mass is inferred and compared with results from different methods. In
presence of a massive vortex $(m_{\rm VH}=5)$, the hole mass has to be reduced
by a factor 2-3 with respect to the case of a massless vortex, to get the fit.

redshifts, we study the effects of proximity to the background quasar. In a
sample of sixteen quasars at z(QSO) between 2.14 and 2.87 observed at 6.6 km/s
resolution with VLT/UVES, we detect 35 OVI absorption-line systems lying within
8000 km/s of z(QSO). The systems can be categorized into 9 strong and 26 weak
OVI absorbers. The strong absorbers are defined by the presence of either
broad, fully saturated OVI absorption or partial coverage of the continuum
source, and have log N(OVI)>~15.0; these systems are intrinsic to the AGN. The
weak (narrow) systems show no partial coverage or saturation, and are
characterized by log N(OVI)<14.5 and have a median total velocity width of only
42 km/s. The incidence dN/dz of weak OVI systems within 2000 km/s of the quasar
is 42+/-12. Between 2000 and 8000 km/s, dN/dz falls to 14+/-4, equal to the
incidence of intervening OVI absorbers. Whereas the accompanying H I and C IV
column densities are significantly lower (by a mean of ~1 dex) in the weak OVI
absorbers within 2000 km/s of z(QSO) than in those at larger velocities, the
OVI column densities display no dependence on proximity. Furthermore,
significant offsets between the HI and OVI centroids in ~50% of the weak
absorbers imply that (at least in these cases) the HI and OVI are not formed in
the same phase of gas. In summary, we find no firm evidence that quasar
radiation influences the OVI-bearing gas, suggesting the OVI is collisionally
ionized rather than photoionized, possibly in the multi-phase halos of
foreground galaxies. Non-equilibrium collisional ionization models are needed
to explain the low temperatures in the absorbing gas, which are implied by
narrow line widths (b<14 km/s) in over half of the observed OVI components.
