O3/O7 flux compactifications. We consider a special family of examples with a
single nonvanishing Yukawa coupling in the large complex structure limit, which
allows us to study all possible stable vacua of the tree-level no-scale
potential very explicitly. We find that, by tuning fluxes, both supersymmetric
and nonsupersymmetric vacua can be realized at almost any point in the large
complex structure moduli space of one-, two-, and three-parameter models. We
also consider the effects of stringy corrections on tree-level vacua. We argue
quite generally that, in certain regimes, both supersymmetric and
nonsupersymmetric tree-level vacua could serve as consistent, controllable
foundations for full stabilization beyond tree level (including Kahler moduli),
leading to either AdS or dS cosmological constants. We show how to achieve
these regimes in our models. Finally, we discuss some implications of
minimizing at tree level the no-scale form of the scalar potential, versus
other potentials used in statistical studies.

\emph{allocation problem}, we are given a planar graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
together with an $n$-point set $X$ in the plane and have to draw $G$ without
edge crossings so that as many vertices as possible are located in $X$. Let
$fit(G)$ denote the maximum number of points fitting this purpose in the worst
case. As $fix(G)\le fit(G)$, we are interested in upper bounds for the latter
and lower bounds for the former parameter.
  For each $\epsilon>0$, we construct an infinite sequence of graphs with
$fit(G)=O(n^{\sigma+\epsilon})$, where $\sigma<0.99$ is a known graph-theoretic
constant, namely the shortness exponent for the class of cubic polyhedral
graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of graphs with

can have only few collinear vertices in any crossing-free drawing. To prove the
lower bound for $fix(G)$, we show that graphs of tree-width 2 admit drawings

color-charges. I reviewed the possibilities in a talk explaining that there was
a general consensus that for Au+Au central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV, leading particles are the only way to find jets because of the large
particle density. The good news was that hard-scattering in p-p collisions was
originally observed by the method of leading particles and that these
techniques could be used to study hard-scattering and jets in Au+Au collisions.
Notably, I described ``How everything you want to know about jets can be found
using 2-particle correlations''. In fact, the predicted ``jet quenching'' and
other new phenomena were discovered by this method. However, this past year, I
had to soften the statement to {\em almost everything} because we found by
explicit calculation in PHENIX that the away-side two-particle correlation
$p_{T_a}$ spectrum from a $\pi^0$ trigger with $p_{T_t}$ is not sensitive to
the fragmentation function--overturning a belief dating from the seminal paper
of Feynman, Field and Fox in 1977. A new formula was derived which showed that
the shape of the $p_{T_a}$ spectrum depends only on the power $n$ of the parton
invariant cross section so that NLO pQCD calculations of the two particle
away-side correlations are, in fact, less sensitive to the shape of the
fragmentation function than calculations of the inclusive $\pi^0$ cross
section.

Diagnostic quantities constructed from the angle coordinates both allow the

should be responsible for energy dissipation of very energetic relativistic
fluids such as ultrarelativistic shocks in gamma-ray bursts and jets in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this case, the photon breeding process operates. It
is a kind of the converter mechanism with the high-energy photons and e^+ e^-
pairs converting into each other via pair production and inverse Compton
scattering. Under certain conditions, which should be satisfied in powerful
AGNs, the photon breeding mechanism becomes supercritical: the high-energy
photons breed exponentially until their feedback on the fluid changes its
velocity pattern. Then the system comes to a self-adjusting near-critical
steady state. Monte-Carlo simulations with the detailed treatment of particle
propagation and interactions demonstrate that a jet with the Lorentz factor
Gamma ~ 20 can radiate away up to a half of its total energy and for Gamma=40
the radiation efficiency can be up to 80 per cent. Outer layers of the jet
decelerate down to a moderate Lorentz factor 2-4, while the spine of the jet
has the final Lorentz factor in the range 10-20 independently on the initial
Gamma. Such sharp deceleration under the impact of radiation must cause a
number of interesting phenomena such as formation of internal shocks and an
early generation of turbulence.

photons propagating from the jet to the external environment and back with the
conversion into electron-positron pairs. The exponential growth of the energy
density of these photons is a super-critical process powered by the bulk energy
of the jet. The efficient deceleration of the jet outer layers creates a
structured jet morphology with the fast spine and slow sheath. In initially
fast and high-power jets even the spine can be decelerated efficiently leading
to very high radiative efficiencies of conversion of the jet bulk energy into
radiation. The decelerating, structured jets have angular distribution of
radiation significantly broader than that predicted by a simple blob model with
a constant Lorentz factor. This reconciles the discrepancy between the high
Doppler factors determined by the fits to the spectra of TeV blazars and the
low apparent velocities observed at VLBI scales as well as the low jet Lorentz
factors required by the observed statistics and luminosity ratio of
Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxies and BL Lac objects. Photon breeding produces a
population of high-energy leptons in agreement with the constraints on the
electron injection function required by spectral fits of the TeV blazars.
Relativistic pairs created outside the jet and emitting gamma-rays by inverse
Compton process might explain the relatively high level of the TeV emission
from the misaligned jet in the radio galaxies. The mechanism reproduces basic
spectral features observed in blazars including the blazar sequence (shift of
the spectral peaks towards lower energies with increasing luminosity). The
mechanism is very robust and can operate in various environments characterised
by the high photon density.

high-density morphology (core of supercluster) at mass fraction $m_f \approx

  Aims. We present the expected characteristics of the low-frequency
magnetospheric radio emission of all currently known extrasolar planets,
including the maximum emission frequency and the expected radio flux. We also
discuss the escape of exoplanetary radio emission from the vicinity of its
source, which imposes additional constraints on detectability.
  Methods. We compare the different predictions obtained with all four existing
analytical models for all currently known exoplanets. We also take care to use
realistic values for all input parameters.
  Results. The four different models for planetary radio emission lead to very
different results. The largest fluxes are found for the magnetic energy model,
followed by the CME model and the kinetic energy model (for which our results
are found to be much less optimistic than those of previous studies). The
unipolar interaction model does not predict any observable emission for the
present exoplanet census. We also give estimates for the planetary magnetic
dipole moment of all currently known extrasolar planets, which will be useful
for other studies.
  Conclusions. Our results show that observations of exoplanetary radio
emission are feasible, but that the number of promising targets is not very
high. The catalog of targets will be particularly useful for current and future
radio observation campaigns (e.g. with the VLA, GMRT, UTR-2 and with LOFAR).

CC methods with a complete treatment of one- and two-body clusters (CCSD) and a

discuss the impact of the center-of-mass contaminations, the choice of the

the probability density function (pdf) of the fluctuations of total energy is
related to the characterization of velocity correlations. Two different regimes
are addressed: the gas driven at the boundaries and the homogeneously driven
gas. In a granular gas, due to non-Gaussianity of the velocity pdf or lack of
homogeneity in hydrodynamics profiles, even in the absence of velocity
correlations, the fluctuations of total energy are non-trivial and may lead to
erroneous conclusions about the role of correlations. In the second part of the
chapter we take into consideration the fluctuations of injected power in driven
granular gas models. Recently, real and numerical experiments have been
interpreted as evidence that the fluctuations of power injection seem to
satisfy the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Relation. We will discuss an
alternative interpretation of such results which invalidates the
Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry. Moreover, starting from the Liouville equation and
using techniques from large deviation theory, the general validity of a
Fluctuation Relation for power injection in driven granular gases is
questioned. Finally a functional is defined using the Lebowitz-Spohn approach
for Markov processes applied to the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation
relevant to describe the motion of a tracer particle. Such a functional results
to be different from injected power and to satisfy a Fluctuation Relation.

with K-band photometry from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)
Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS), Data Release 3 and
optical photometry from Data Release 5 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Various features and limitations of the new UKIDSS data are examined, such as a
problem affecting Petrosian magnitudes of extended sources. Selection limits in
K- and r-band magnitude, K-band surface brightness and K-band radius are
included explicitly in the 1/Vmax estimate of the space density and luminosity
function. The bivariate brightness distribution in K-band absolute magnitude
and surface brightness is presented and found to display a clear
luminosity--surface brightness correlation that flattens at high luminosity and
broadens at low luminosity, consistent with similar analyses at optical
wavelengths. Best fitting Schechter function parameters for the K-band
luminosity function are found to be M*-5 log h=-23.19 +/- 0.04, alpha=-0.81 +/-
0.04 and phi*=(0.0166 +/- 0.0008)h^3 Mpc^{-3}, although the Schechter function
provides a poor fit to the data at high and low luminosity, while the
luminosity density in the K band is found to be j = (6.305 +/- 0.067) x 10^8
L_sun h Mpc^{-3}. However, we caution that there are various known sources of
incompleteness and uncertainty in our results. Using mass-to-light ratios
determined from the optical colours we estimate the stellar mass function,
finding good agreement with previous results. Possible improvements are
discussed that could be implemented when extending this analysis to the full

inspection shows the existence of many long-lived (several hours) structures
that interact frequently, and may migrate over distances ~7 Mm over a period of
a few hours. About a fifth of the elements have an associated bright point in
G-band or Ca II H intensity. We apply a hysteresis-based algorithm to identify
elements. The algorithm is able to track elements for about 10 min on average.
Elements intermittently drop below the detection limit, though the associated
flux apparently persists and often reappears some time later. We infer proper
motions of elements from their successive positions, and find that they obey a
Gaussian distribution with an rms of 1.57+-0.08 km/s. The apparent flows
indicate a bias of about 0.2 km/s toward the network boundary. Elements of
negative polarity show a higher bias than elements of positive polarity,
perhaps as a result of to the dominant positive polarity of the network in the
field of view, or because of increased mobility due to their smaller size. A
preference for motions in X is likely explained by higher supergranular flow in
that direction. We search for emerging bipoles by grouping elements of opposite
polarity that appear close together in space and time. We find no evidence
supporting Joy's law at arcsecond scales.

The corresponding scattering matrix is nontrivial but breaks the Lorentz

M/L ratios than Virgo UCDs, suggesting possible differences in age or dark
matter content between Fornax and Virgo UCDs. For our sample of Fornax UCDs we
find no significant correlation between M/L ratio and mass. We combine our data
with available M/L ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with
10^4<M/M_*<10^8, and normalise all M/L estimates to solar metallicity. We find
that UCDs (M > 2*10^6 M_*) have M/L ratios twice as large as GCs (M < 2*10^6
M_*). We show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamical
M/L ratios of UCDs and over-predict those of GCs. Considering the scaling
relations of stellar spheroids, UCDs align well along the 'Fundamental
Manifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. The
alignment for UCDs is especially clear for r_e >~ 7 pc, which corresponds to
dynamical relaxation times that exceed a Hubble time. In contrast, GCs exhibit
a broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. We argue that
UCDs are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with M > 2*10^6
M_* and 7<r_e<100 pc. Future studies should aim at explaining the elevated M/L
ratios of UCDs and the environmental dependence of their properties.

RXJ1648 contains a central string of seven bright galaxies, which have a
smaller velocity dispersion, are on average brighter, and have less star
formation (lower EW([OII]) and EW(H_delta)) than other group galaxies. The 4-5
brightest galaxies in this string should sink to the center and merge through
dynamical friction by z=0, forming a BCG consistent with a system of RXJ1648's
mass even if 5-50% of the light is lost to an intracluster light component
(ICL). The L_X-T_X relation for intermediate-redshift groups/poor clusters is

fact be \emph{identified}. Recently, it has been shown that the simplest s-wave
superconducting state for the Dirac fermion approximation of the honeycomb
lattice at precisely half filling, supports zero modes inside the cores of
vortices (P. Ghaemi and F. Wilczek, 2007). We find that within the continuum
Dirac theory the zero modes are not unique neither to this phase, nor to half
filling. In addition, we find the \emph{exact} wavefunctions for vortex bound
zero modes, as well as the complete edge state spectrum of the phases we
discuss. The zero modes in all the phases we examine have even-numbered
degeneracy, and as such pairs of any Majorana modes are simply equivalent to
one ordinary fermion. As a result, contrary to bound state zero modes in $p_x+i
p_y$ superconductors, vortices here do \emph{not} exhibit non-Abelian exchange
statistics. The zero modes in the pure Dirac theory are seemingly topologically
protected by the effective low energy symmetry of the theory, yet on the

to search for the primordial gravitational waves through the B-modes.
Bolometric interferometry is an appealing alternative to direct imaging that
combines the advantages of interferometry in terms of systematic effects
handling and those of bolometric detectors in terms of sensitivity. Aims: We
calculate the signal from a bolometric interferometer in order to investigate
its sensitivity to the Stokes parameters paying particular attention to the
choice of the phase-shifting scheme applied to the input channels in order to
modulate the signal. Methods: The signal is expressed as a linear combination
of the Stokes parameter visibilities whose coefficients are functions of the
phase-shifts. Results: We show that the signal to noise ratio on the
reconstructed visibilities can be maximized provided the fact that the
phase-shifting scheme is chosen in a particular way called coherent summation
of equivalent baselines. As a result, a bolometric interferometer is
competitive with an imager having the same number of horns, but only if the
coherent summation of equivalent baselines is performed. We confirm our
calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation. We also discuss the impact of the
uncertainties on the relative calibration between bolometers and propose a way
to avoid this systematic effect.

either the initial or final Hamiltonian is a one-dimensional projector
Hamiltonian on the corresponding ground state. The minimum energy gap which
governs the time required for a successful evolution is shown to be
proportional to the overlap of the ground states of the initial and final
Hamiltonians. We show that such evolutions exhibit a rapid crossover as the
ground state changes abruptly near the transition point where the energy gap is

partial adiabatic evolution within a narrow interval around the transition
point. These results generalize and quantify earlier works.

direct and simple method for modeling three-phase permanent-magnet and
induction machines. The Lagrangian is the sum a mechanical one and of a
magnetic one. This magnetic Lagrangian is expressed in terms of rotor angle,
complex stator and rotor currents. A complexification procedure widely used in
quantum electrodynamic is applied here in order to derive the Euler-Lagrange
equations with complex stator and rotor currents. Such complexification process
avoids the usual separation into real and imaginary parts and simplifies
notably the calculations. Via simple modifications of such magnetic Lagrangians
we derive new dynamical models describing permanent-magnet machines with both
saturation and saliency, and induction machines with both magnetic saturation
and space harmonics. For each model we also provide its Hamiltonian thus its
magnetic energy. This energy is also expressed with complex currents and can be
directly used in Lyapunov and/or passivity based control. Further, we briefly
investigate the observability of this class of Euler-Lagrange models, in the
so-called sensorless case when the measured output is the stator current and
the load torque is constant but unknown. For all the dynamical models obtained
via such variational principles, we prove that their linear tangent systems are
unobservable around a one-dimensional family of steady-states attached to the
same constant stator voltage and current. This negative result explains why
sensorless control of three-phase electrical machines around zero stator
frequency remains yet a difficult control problem.

the geometry of the array and is, therefore, considered as fixed independently

propose a new characteristic distance, which we call ropt, specifically
determined for each individual shower, with the objective of optimizing the
energy reconstruction. This parameter may not only improve the energy
determination, but also allow a more reliable reconstruction of the shape and
position of rapidly varying spectral features. We show that the use of a
specific ropt determined on a shower-to-shower basis, instead of using a fixed
characteristic value, is of particular benefit in dealing with the energy
reconstruction of events with saturated detectors, which are in general a large
fraction of all the events detected by an array as energy increases.
Furthermore, the ropt approach has the additional advantage of applying the
same unified treatment for all detected events, regardless of whether they have
saturated detectors or not.

i.e. they are narrow and have small velocity offset (Dv < 20 km/s) from
absorption lines associated with neutral gas. In addition, the NV absorption
has similar velocity as the UV-pumped fine-structure lines indicating these
high ions are located within ~1kpc of the GRB afterglow. These characteristics
are unlike those for NV gas detected in the halo/disk of the Milky Way or along

that GRB afterglows photoionize nitrogen to NV at r~10pc. This process can
produce NV absorption with characteristics resembling the majority of our

sightlines. Therefore, the observations provide a snapshot of the physical
conditions at this distance. In this scenario, the observations imply the
progenitor's stellar wind is confined to r<10pc which suggests the GRB
progenitors occur within dense (n > 10^3 cm^-3) environments, typical of

into account the fact that the quantum entanglement between the degrees of
freedom of a scalar field, traced inside the event horizon, can be the origin
of black hole entropy. The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the
well-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called
`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,
provided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum
uncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.
However, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a
superposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area
law is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,
so that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On
ascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to
the entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees
of freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the
contributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for
excited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from
the area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the
far-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced
over) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.
Although most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a
hypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we
show that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static
asymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.

correlated and anti-correlated surfaces morphologies is studied using the
Keldysh non-equilibrium Green function technique. Due to the pseudo-periodicity
of these structures, the energy-resolved transmission possesses pseudo-bands
and pseudo-gaps. Channels with correlated surfaces exhibit wider pseudo-bands
than their anti-correlated counterparts. By surveying channels with various
combinations of material parameters, we found that a smaller transport mass
increases the channel transmittivity and energy bandwidth of the pseudo-bands.
A larger quantization mass yields a larger transmittivity in channels with
anti-correlated surfaces. For channels with correlated surfaces, the dependence
of transmittivity on quantization mass is complicated by odd-to-even mode
transitions. An enhanced threshold energy in the energy-resolved transmission
can also be observed in the presence of surface roughness. The computed
enhanced threshold energy was able to achieve agreement with the experimental
data for Si[110] and Si[100] devices.

into a 3-manifold, specifically $R^3$. The F\'ary-Milnor Theorem says that any
curve in $R^3$ of total curvature less than $4\pi$ is unknotted. More
generally, a (finite) graph consists of a finite number of edges and vertices.
Given a topological type of graphs $\Gamma$, what limitations on the isotopy
class of $\Gamma$ are implied by a bound on total curvature? What does ``total
curvature"" mean for a graph? We define a natural notion of net total curvature
of a graph $\Gamma$ in $R^3$, and prove that if $\Gamma$ is homeomorphic to the
$\theta$-graph, then the net total curvature of $\Gamma$ \geq 3\pi$; and if it
is $< 4\pi$, then $\Gamma$ is isotopic in $R^3$ to a planar $\theta$-graph.
Further, the net total curvature $= 3\pi$ only when $\Gamma$ is a convex plane
curve plus a chord. We begin our discussion with piecewise smooth graphs, and
extend all these results to continuous graphs in the final section. In
particular, we show that continuous graphs of finite total curvature are
isotopic to polygonal graphs.

carried out with the Arecibo telescope in two fields that permit sampling of

Hi around M33 detected by our survey is $\sim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. At least 50%
of this mass is made of HI clouds that are related both in space and velocity
to the galaxy. We discuss several scenarios for the origin of these clouds
focusing on the two most interesting ones: $(a)$ dark-matter dominated gaseous
satellites, $(b)$ debris from filaments flowing into M33 from the intergalactic
medium or generated by a previous interaction with M31. Both scenarios seem to
fit with the observed cloud properties. Some structures are found at anomalous
velocities, particularly an extended HI complex previously detected by Thilker
et al. (2002). Even though the ALFALFA observations seem to indicate that this
cloud is possibly connected to M33 by a faint gas bridge, we cannot firmly
establish its extragalactic nature or its relation to M33. Taking into account
that the clouds associated with M33 are likely to be highly ionised by the
extragalactic UV radiation, we predict that the total gas mass associated with

aboard \textit{Hinode} clearly show that the outer boundary of the penumbra
fluctuates around its averaged position. The penumbral outer boundary moves
inward when granules appear in the outer penumbra. We discover that such
granules appear one after another while moving magnetic features (MMFs) are
separating from the penumbral ``spines'' (penumbral features that have stronger
and more vertical fields than those of their surroundings). These granules that
appear in the outer penumbra often merge with bright features inside the
penumbra that move with the spines as they elongate toward the moat region.
This suggests that convective motions around the penumbral outer boundary are
related to the disintegration of magnetic flux in the sunspot. We also find
that dark penumbral filaments frequently elongate into the moat region in the
vicinity of MMFs that detach from penumbral spines. Such elongating dark
penumbral filaments correspond to nearly horizontal fields extending from the
penumbra. Pairs of MMFs with positive and negative polarities are sometimes
observed along the elongating dark penumbral filaments. This strongly supports
the notion that such elongating dark penumbral filaments have magnetic fields
with a ``sea serpent''-like structure. Evershed flows, which are associated
with the penumbral horizontal fields, may be related to the detachment of the
MMFs from the penumbral spines, as well as to the formation of the MMFs along
the dark penumbral filaments that elongate into the moat region.

conditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their
higher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.
Furthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion

demonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific

maximum in the network. When the network has a modular structure, the model
generates the phase synchronization within each module, however, not over the

Holeums could have been produced in the early universe and could be a component
of the Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM) present in galactic halos. We show that
Holeums of masses of the order of 10**13 to 10**14 GeV and above are stable
enough to survive in the present-day universe. We identify such Holeums as
promising candidates for the SHDM ""X-particle"" and show that the decay of such
Holeums by pressure ionization can give rise to cosmic rays of all observed
energies, including Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). The absence of the
GZK cut-off is explained by the galactic halo origin of the UHECR. We predict
that the cosmic rays are a manifestation of the end-stage Hawking radiation
burst of the primordial black holes (PBH) liberated by the ionization of
Holeums. Antimatter detected in cosmic rays could be a signature of their
Holeum origin.

Energy Sum Rule (FESR) involving the correlator of axial-vector divergences, to

non-perturbative QCD and higher order quark mass corrections. This FESR is
designed to reduce considerably the systematic uncertainties arising from the

less than 3-4% to the quark mass. This is achieved by introducing an
integration kernel in the form of a second degree polynomial, restricted to
vanish at the peak of the two lowest lying resonances. The driving hadronic
contribution is then the pion pole, with parameters well known from experiment.
The determination is done in the framework of Contour Improved Perturbation

constant mass-to-light ratio. The halo component we chose corresponds to the so
called universal rotation curve. In each case, we used the response of gaseous
and stellar particle disc to rigidly rotating potential to determine the
pattern speed.
  We find that the pattern speed of the bar depends roughly on the
morphological type. The average value of corotation resonance radius to bar
radius, $\mathcal{R}$, increases from $1.15 \pm 0.25$ in types SB0/a -- SBab to
$1.44 \pm 0.29$ in SBb and $1.82\pm 0.63$ in SBbc -- SBc. Within the error
estimates for the pattern speed and bar radius, all galaxies of type SBab or
earlier have a fast bar ($\mathcal{R} \le 1.4$), whereas the bars in later type
galaxies include both fast and slow rotators. Of 16 later type galaxies with a
nominal value of $\mathcal{R} > 1.4$, there are five cases, where the fast
rotating bar is ruled out by the adopted error estimates.
  We also study the correlation between the parameter $\mathcal{R}$ and other
galactic properties. The clearest correlation is with the bar size: the slowest
bars are also the shortest bars when compared to the galaxy size. A weaker
correlation is seen with bar strength in a sense that slow bars tend to be
weaker. These correlations leave room for a possibility that the determined
pattern speed in many galaxies corresponds actually that of the spiral, which
rotates more slowly than the bar. No clear correlation is seen with either the
galaxy luminosity or colour.

rapidity showing a larger suppression at forward rapidity. J/psi suppression
mechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with
co-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected
that more c\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity
via recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production
from initially produced c\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of
uncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the
elliptic flow (v2).
  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected. The statistics has been increased compared to
previous 2004 data set, thus allowing a more precise measurement of the J/psi
production at both mid and forward rapidity. Furthermore, the PHENIX experiment
benefited from the addition of a new detector, which improves the reaction
plane resolution and allows us to measure the J/psi v2. Comparing this
measurement to the positive D-mesons v2 (through non-photonic electron decays)
will help constraining the J/psi production mechanisms and getting a more
precise picture of the proportion of J/psi coming from direct production or
charm quark coalescence.
  Details on how the J/psi v2 is measured at both rapidities are presented. The
J/psi v2 as a function of transverse momentum are compared to existing models.

close to its rotation axis (i.e. along its angular momentum vector and
orthogonal to any attendant accretion disc). Many YSOs are formed from dense
prestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations
of outflows and filaments may place useful constraints on the dynamics of core
formation.
  Aims: We explore this possibility, from the viewpoint of what it may tell us
about the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress
that we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and
outflows to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently
also an interesting issue.
  Results: Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible
selection effects or correlations between nearby outflows, we infer that the
observed outflows have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that
contain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions
of the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that 72%
of outflows are within $45^{\rm o}$ of being orthogonal to the filament, and
only 28% are within $45^{\rm o}$ of being parallel to the filament.
  Conclusions: This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs
driving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately
orthogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed. We briefly discuss
the implications of this for two proposed core formation mechanisms.

V is not contained in any proper algebraic subgroup of A, and transverse if it
is not contained in any translate of such a subgroup.
  Assume a conjectural lower bound for the normalized height of V. For V
transverse, we prove that the algebraic points of bounded height of V which lie
in the union of all algebraic subgroups of A of codimension at least d+1
translated by the points close to a subgroup G of finite rank are non

this hypothesis because they are the only stellar objects whose absolute neon

Handling of Clumpy Media","To appear in ApJ September 20, 2008",,"10.1086/590482",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to unified schemes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the central
engine is surrounded by dusty, optically thick clouds in a toroidal structure.
We have recently developed a formalism that for the first time takes proper
account of the clumpy nature of the AGN torus. We now provide a detailed report
of our findings in a two-paper series. Here we present our general formalism
for radiative transfer in clumpy media and construct its building blocks for
the AGN problem -- the source functions of individual dusty clouds heated by
the AGN radiation field. We show that a fundamental difference from smooth
density distributions is that in a clumpy medium, a large range of dust
temperatures coexist at the same distance from the radiation central source.
This distinct property explains the low dust temperatures found close to the
nucleus of NGC1068 in 10 \mic interferometric observations. We find that
irrespective of the overall geometry, a clumpy dust distribution shows only
moderate variation in its spectral energy distribution, and the 10\mic\
absorption feature is never deep. Furthermore, the X-ray attenuating column
density is widely scattered around the column density that characterizes the IR
emission. All of these properties are characteristic of AGN observations. The
assembly of clouds into AGN tori and comparison with observations is presented
in the companion paper.

models with \No \about 5--15 dusty clouds along radial equatorial rays
successfully explain AGN infrared observations. The dust has standard Galactic
composition, with individual cloud optical depth \tV \about 30--100 at visual.
The models naturally explain the observed behavior of the 10\mic silicate
feature, in particular the lack of deep absorption features in AGN of any type.
The weak 10\mic emission feature tentatively detected in type 2 QSO can be
reproduced if in these sources \No drops to \about 2 or \tV exceeds \about 100.
The clouds angular distribution must have a soft-edge, e.g., Gaussian profile,
the radial distribution should decrease as $1/r$ or $1/r^2$. Compact tori can
explain all observations, in agreement with the recent interferometric evidence
that the ratio of the torus outer to inner radius is perhaps as small as \about
5--10. Clumpy torus models can produce nearly isotropic IR emission together
with highly anisotropic obscuration, as required by observations. In contrast
with strict variants of unification schemes where the viewing-angle uniquely
determines the classification of an AGN into type 1 or 2, clumpiness implies
that it is only a probabilistic effect; a source can display type 1 properties
even from directions close to the equatorial plane. The fraction of obscured
sources depends not only on the torus angular thickness but also on the cloud
number \No. The observed decrease of this fraction at increasing luminosity can
be explained with a decrease of either torus angular thickness or cloud number,
but only the latter option explains also the possible emergence of a 10\mic
emission feature in QSO2.

CO multi-transitional line observations as a mass-loss-rate estimator for AGB
stars. Mass-loss rates for 10 intermediate- to high-mass-loss-rate AGB stars
are derived using a detailed non-LTE, non-local radiative transfer code based
on the Monte-Carlo method to model the CO radio line intensities. The
circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically symmetric and formed by
constant mass-loss rates. The energy balance is solved self-consistently and
the effects of dust on the radiation field and thermal balance are included. An
independent estimate of the mass-loss rate is also obtained from the
combination of dust radiative transfer modelling with a dynamical model of the
gas and dust particles. We find that the CO radio line intensities and shapes
are successfully reproduced for the majority of our objects assuming a constant
mass-loss rate. Moreover, the CO line intensities are only weakly dependent on
the adopted micro-turbulent velocity, in contrast to recent claims in the
literature. The two methods used in the present work to derive mass-loss-rates
are consistent within a factor of ~3 for intermediate- to high-mass-loss-rate
objects, indicating that this is a lower limit to the uncertainty in present
mass-loss-rate estimates. We find a tentative trend with chemistry. Mass-loss
rates from the dust/dynamical model are systematically higher than those from
the CO model for the carbon stars and vice versa for the M-type stars. This
could be ascribed to a discrepancy in the adopted CO/H_2-abundance ratio, but
we caution that the sample is small and systematic errors cannot be excluded.

performances and properties has been reached. This is due to the
characteristics of these techniques that have been studied essentially through
numerical simulations based on semi-empirical models of the CMB and the
Galactic foregrounds. Such models often have different level of sophistication
and/or are based on different physical assumptions (e.g., the number of the
Galactic components and the level of the noise). Hence, a reliable comparison
is difficult. What actually is missing is a statistical analysis of the
properties of the proposed methodologies. Here, we consider the ""Internal
Linear Combination"" method (ILC) which, among the separation techniques,
requires the smallest number of ""a priori"" assumptions. This feature is of
particular interest in the context of the CMB polarization measurements at
small angular scales where the lack of knowledge of the polarized backgrounds
represents a serious limit. METHODS: The statistical characteristics of ILC are
examined through an analytical approach and the basic conditions are fixed in a
way to work satisfactorily. RESULTS: ILC provides satisfactory results only
under rather restrictive conditions. This is a critical fact to take into
consideration in planning the future ground-based observations (e.g., with
ALMA) where, contrary to the satellite experiments, there is the possibility to
have a certain control of the experimental conditions.

the Josephson critical current exhibits an asymmetric resonance against the QD

the insulating barrier and the resonant one through the QD. Moreover, we find
that the Josephson critical current changes its sign around the resonance when

were carried out with the MIDI instrument at the Very Large Telescope

spectral resolution of 30 in the wavelength range from 8 to 13 micron. For the
interpretation we developed a simple dusty disk model with small and variable

measured flux with wavelength with no apparent silicate feature around 10
micron. We find that the mid-IR emission from the nucleus can be reproduced by
an extended dust disk or torus with a small covering factor of the radiating
dust clouds. Our mid-IR observations of NGC 3783 are consistent with a clumpy
circumnuclear dust environment. The interpretation in terms of a dusty torus
with low covering factor supports a clumpy version of the unified scheme for

frequency of the other (radio-frequency) field \omega_{rf} is close to the Rabi
frequency \omega_{1} in a micro-wave field. It is shown theoretically that Rabi
oscillations between dressed-spin states with the frequency \epsilon are
accompanied by higher-frequency oscillations at frequencies n\omega_{rf} and
n\omega_{rf}\pm \epsilon, where n = 1, 2, .... The most intense among these are
the signals corresponding to n = 1. The counter-rotating (antiresonance)
components of the RF field give rise to a shift of the dressed-state energy,
i.e., to a frequency shift similar to the Bloch-Siegert shift. In particular,
this shift is manifested as the dependence of the Rabi-oscillation frequency
\epsilon on the sign of the detuning \omega{1} -\omega{rf} from resonance. In
the case of double resonance, the oscillation amplitude is asymmetric; i.e.,
the amplitude at the sum frequency \omega_{rf} +\epsilon increases, while the
amplitude at the difference frequency \omega_{rf} -\epsilon decreases. The
predicted effects are confirmed by observations of the nutation signals of the

adjusted so as to coerce admissibility of the votes (rather than excluding
inadmissible votes a priori), with respect to procedural control. In such
control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election
via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.
SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of
candidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'
approval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred
candidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule
coerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and
hybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.

corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of
constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to
control than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a

Carlo simulation based derivative pricing. Existing importance sampling methods
are based on a parametric choice of the proposal. This article proposes an
algorithm that estimates the optimal proposal nonparametrically using a
multivariate frequency polygon estimator. In contrast to parametric methods,
nonparametric estimation allows for close approximation of the optimal
proposal. Standard nonparametric importance sampling is inefficient for
high-dimensional problems. We solve this issue by applying the procedure to a
low-dimensional subspace, which is identified through principal component
analysis and the concept of the effective dimension. The mean square error
properties of the algorithm are investigated and its asymptotic optimality is
shown. Quasi-Monte Carlo is used for further improvement of the method. It is
easy to implement, particularly it does not require any analytical computation,
and it is computationally very efficient. We demonstrate through path-dependent
and multi-asset option pricing problems that the algorithm leads to significant
efficiency gains compared to other algorithms in the literature.

Dirac-like spinor model with random vector potential is studied. These
correlations originate from a spontaneously broken symmetry and their
corresponding Goldstone modes. Using a strong-disorder expansion, correlation
functions and matrix elements are analyzed and compared with results from a
weak-disorder expansion. The local density of states correlation and the
overlap between states above and below the Dirac point are characterized by a
long-range behavior. The correlation range decreases with the distance from the

proportional to the one-particle scattering time for any strength of disorder.
A consequence of the special properties of particle-hole scattering is a
constant microwave conductivity for weak as well as for strong disorder,
describing a deviation from conventional Drude-like transport. Some properties

an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities (RVs) and
stellar atmosphere parameters of up to one million stars using the 6dF
multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m UK Schmidt Telescope of the
Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO). It is obtaining medium resolution spectra
(median R=7,500) in the Ca-triplet region (8,410--8,795 \AA) for southern
hemisphere stars in the magnitude range 9<I<12. Following the first data
release (Steinmetz et al. 2006) the current release doubles the sample of
published RVs, now containing 51,829 RVs for 49,327 individual stars observed
on 141 nights between April 11 2003 and March 31 2005. Comparison with external
data sets shows that the new data collected since April 3 2004 show a standard
deviation of 1.3 km/s, about twice better than for the first data release. For
the first time this data release contains values of stellar parameters from
22,407 spectra of 21,121 individual stars. They were derived by a penalized
\chi^2 method using an extensive grid of synthetic spectra calculated from the
latest version of Kurucz models. From comparison with external data sets, our
conservative estimates of errors of the stellar parameters (for a spectrum with
S/N=40) are 400 K in temperature, 0.5 dex in gravity, and 0.2 dex in
metallicity. We note however that the internal errors estimated from repeat
RAVE observations of 822 stars are at least a factor 2 smaller. We demonstrate
that the results show no systematic offsets if compared to values derived from
photometry or complementary spectroscopic analyses. The data release includes
proper motion and photometric measurements. It can be accessed via the RAVE
webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org and through CDS.

Their ground-state wave functions have been obtained using a self-consistent
axially-symmetric mean-field approximation with density-dependent effective
two-body Skyrme interactions. Some differences from previous shell-model
calculations appear for the isovector Coulomb form factors which play a role in
determining the parity-violating asymmetry. To gain an understanding of how
these differences arise, the results have been expanded in a spherical harmonic
oscillator basis. Results are obtained not only within the plane-wave Born
approximation, but also using the distorted-wave Born approximation for
comparison with potential future experimental studies of parity-violating
electron scattering. To this end, for each nucleus the focus is placed on
kinematic ranges where the signal (isospin-mixing effects on the
parity-violating asymmetry) and the experimental figure-of-merit are maximized.
Strangeness contributions to the asymmetry are also briefly discussed, since
they and the isospin mixing contributions may play comparable roles for the
nuclei being studied at the low momentum transfers of interest in the present

three matrix model that exhibits an exotic phase transition. The nature of the
transition is very different if approached from the high or low temperature
side. The high temperature phase is described by three self interacting random
matrices with no background spacetime geometry. As the system cools there is a
phase transition in which a classical two-sphere condenses to form the
background geometry. The transition has an entropy jump or latent heat, yet the
specific heat diverges as the transition is approached from low temperatures.
We find no divergence or evidence of critical fluctuations when the transition
is approached from the high temperature phase. At sufficiently low temperatures
the system is described by small fluctuations, on a background classical
two-sphere, of a U(1) gauge field coupled to a massive scalar field. The
critical temperature is pushed upwards as the scalar field mass is increased.
Once the geometrical phase is well established the specific heat takes the
value 1 with the gauge and scalar fields each contributing 1/2.

concen- trated frozen ferrofluid exhibiting a low temperature superspin glass
transition. With a method initially developed for spin glasses, we investigate
the field dependence of the relaxations that take place after different aging
times. We extract the typical number of correlated spins involved in the aging
dynamics. This brings important insights into the dynamical correlation length
and its time growth. Our results, consistent with expressions obtained for spin
glasses, extend the generality of these behaviours to the class of superspin
glasses. Since the typical flipping time is much larger for superspins than for
atomic spins, our experiments probe a time regime much closer to that of
numerical simulations.

processes affecting cluster galaxies. Both CCD R band and H alpha narrow-band
imaging was used to determine photometric parameters (m_(r), r_(24), H alpha
flux and equivalent width) and derive star formation rates for 227 CGCG
galaxies in 8 low-redshift clusters. The galaxy sample is a subset of CGCG
galaxies in an objective prism survey of cluster galaxies for H alpha emission.
It is found that detection of emission-line galaxies in the OPS is 85%, 70%,
and 50% complete at the mean surface brightness values of 1.25 x 10^(-19), 5.19
x 10^(-20), and 1.76 x 10^(-20) W m^(-2) arcsec^(-2), respectively, measured
within the R band isophote of 24 mag arcsec^(-2) for the galaxy. The CCD data,
together with matched data from a recent H alpha galaxy survey of UGC galaxies
within 3000 km s^(-1), will be used for a comparative study of R band and H
alpha surface photometry between cluster and field spirals.

positions of the unresolved QSO images and of the lens; (4) resolving extended
lensed structures from the QSO hosts into faint NIR or optical rings or arcs.
These observations have helped to break some degeneracies on the lens
potential, to probe the galaxy evolution and to reconstruct the true shape of
the QSO host with an increased angular resolution.

two-dimensional manifold in the space of effective radius R_e, projected mass
M_p (measured via strong gravitational lensing) and projected velocity
dispersion sigma within R_e/2. The MP is less `tilted' than the Fundamental
Plane, and the two have comparable associated scatter. This means that
c_e2=2*G*M_p/(R_e*sigma^2) is a nearly universal constant in the range
sigma=175-400 km/s. This finding can be used to constrain the mass distribution
and internal dynamics of early-type galaxies. We find that a relatively wide
class of spherical galaxy models has values of c_e2 in the observed range,
because c_e2 is not very strongly sensitive to the mass distribution and
orbital anisotropy. If the total mass distribution is isothermal, a broad range
of stellar luminosity profile and anisotropy is consistent with the
observations, while NFW dark-matter halos require more fine tuning of the
stellar mass fraction, luminosity profile and anisotropy. If future data can
cover a broader range of masses, the MP could be seen to be tilted and the
value of any such tilt would provide a discriminant between models for the
total mass-density profile of the galaxies. [Abridged]

addressed by assuming $p^2=0$. While this approximation turns out to be
excellent for temperatures $\le 2 T_{\tiny{CMB}}$ the exact result exhibits a
much faster (power-like) shrinking of the gap in the black-body spectral
intensity with rising temperature. Our previous statements on anomalous
