compressible convection with uniform horizontal shear are used to study dynamo
action and the generation of large-scale magnetic fields. Methods: We consider
cases where the magnetic Reynolds number is either marginal or moderately
supercritical with respect to small-scale dynamo action in the absence of shear
and rotation. The effects of magnetic helicity fluxes are studied by comparing
results for the magnetic field with open and closed boundaries. Results:
Without shear no large-scale dynamos are found even if the ingredients
necessary for the alpha-effect (rotation and stratification) are present in the
system. When uniform horizontal shear is added, a large-scale magnetic field
develops, provided the boundaries are open. In this case the mean magnetic
field contains a significant fraction of the total field. For those runs where
the magnetic Reynolds number is between 60 and 250, small-scale dynamo is
expected to be excited, but the field distribution is found to be similar to
cases with smaller magnetic Reynolds number where the small-scale dynamo is not
excited. In the case of closed (perfectly conducting) boundaries, magnetic
helicity fluxes are suppressed and no large-scale fields are found. Similarly,
poor large-scale field development is seen when vertical shear is used in
combination with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions. If,
however, open (normal-field) boundary conditions are used in the x-direction, a
large-scale field develops. These results support the notion that shear not
only helps to generate the field, but it also plays a crucial role in driving
magnetic helicity fluxes out of the system along the isocontours of shear,
thereby allowing efficient dynamo action.

uncovered an important clue to how that coupling might work. Observations of

only if the minimum specific entropy of the intracluster gas is less than 30

physics of electron thermal conduction, implying that conduction is critical
for channeling AGN energy input toward incipient star-forming regions and
limiting the progress of star formation.

potential into the non-singular distorting potential and a remaining singular
part we develop explicitly the secular equations of our approach and prove a
result concerning the symmetry of the atomic matrices. The new secular
equations are similar in overall form to those of related methods, requiring
coupled radial Schr\""odinger-equation solutions for each atomic center,
together with atomic-sphere surface integrals, but no volume integrals. We

multiband signals that have high bandwidths. In this paper we propose a new
scheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of
sampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling
(SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose
sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are
reconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an
accurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling
channels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates
increases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a
significant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate
increases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an
accurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices
that are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low
condition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in
signals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the
sampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be
unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to
multicoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to
an alias in all channels. We have demonstrated that the SMRS scheme obtains
similar performance using 3 sampling channels and a total sampling rate 8 times
the Landau rate to an implementation of a multicoset sampling scheme that uses
6 sampling channels with a total sampling rate of 13 times the Landau rate.

in images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of B-scan

distributions are derived using the square root of the generalized inverse
Gaussian distribution for the amplitude backscatter within the multiplicative

with respect to the widespread ${\mathcal K}_{A}$ distribution when fitting
urban, forested and deforested areas in remote sensing data. This article deals
with the modeling and the simulation of correlated ${\mathcal
G}_{A}^{0}$-distributed random fields. It is accomplished by means of the
Inverse Transform method, applied to Gaussian random fields with spatial
correlation. The main feature of this approach is its generality, since it
allows the introduction of negative correlation values in the resulting
process, necessary for the proper explanation of the shadowing effect in many

brittle fracture. Here, we analyze these theories in the quasistatic regime of
crack propagation. We show how to derive the laws of crack motion either by
using solvability conditions in a perturbative treatment for slight departure
from the Griffith threshold, or by generalizing the Eshelby tensor to
phase-field models. The analysis provides a simple physical interpretation of
the second component of the classic Eshelby integral in the limit of vanishing
crack propagation velocity: it gives the elastic torque on the crack tip that
is needed to balance the Herring torque arising from the anisotropic interface
energy. This force balance condition reduces in this limit to the principle of
local symmetry in isotropic media and to the principle of maximum energy
release rate for smooth curvilinear cracks in anisotropic media. It can also be
interpreted physically in this limit based on energetic considerations in the
traditional framework of continuum fracture mechanics, in support of its
general validity for real systems beyond the scope of phase-field models.
Analytical predictions of crack paths in anisotropic media are validated by
numerical simulations. Simulations also show that these predictions hold even
if the phase-field dynamics is modified to make the failure process
irreversible. In addition, the role of dissipative forces on the process zone
scale as well as the extension of the results to motion of planar cracks under
pure antiplane shear are discussed.

many of the observed characteristics of large-scale structure. But some glaring
problems still remain, including the over-prediction (by a factor 10) of the
number of dwarf galaxies within the virialized population of the local group.
Several secondary effects have already been proposed to resolve this problem.
It is still not clear, however, whether the principal solution rests with
astrophysical processes, such as early feedback from supernovae, or possibly
with as yet undetermined properties of the dark matter itself. In this paper,
we carry out a detailed calculation of the dwarf halo evolution incorporating
the effects of a hypothesized dark-matter decay, D -> D'+l, where D is the
unstable particle, D' is the more massive daughter particle and l is the other,
lighter (or possibly massless) daughter particle. This process preferentially
heats the smaller haloes, expanding them during their evolution and reducing
their present-day circular velocity. We find that this mechanism can account
very well for the factor 4 deficit in the observed number of systems with
velocity 10--20 km/s compared to those predicted by the numerical simulations,
if dm/m_D' ~ 5-7 x 10^{-5}, where dm is the mass difference between the initial

dimensions. In this paper we study the observational consequences of such
couplings for models with large non-gaussianities. Our focus is on the
Gauss-Bonnet term. In particular, we study an effective action where the scalar

enhances the production of gravitational waves, and allows a smaller speed of
sound for scalar perturbations. This, in turn, can lead to larger
non-gaussianities which can be constrained by observations. Using current WMAP
limits on $f_{NL}$ and the tensor/scalar ratio, we put constraints on all
parameters. As an example, we show that for DBI inflation, the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling leads to an interesting observational window with both large $f_{NL}$
and a large amplitude of gravitational waves. Finally, we show that the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling admits a de-Sitter phase with a relativistic dispersion
relation for scalar perturbations.

of a sparse signal using noisy projections defined by various classes of
measurement matrices. Our analysis is high-dimensional in nature, in which the
number of observations $n$, the ambient signal dimension $p$, and the signal
sparsity $k$ are all allowed to tend to infinity in a general manner. This
paper makes two novel contributions. First, we provide sharper necessary
conditions for exact support recovery using general (non-Gaussian) dense
measurement matrices. Combined with previously known sufficient conditions,
this result yields sharp characterizations of when the optimal decoder can
recover a signal for various scalings of the sparsity $k$ and sample size $n$,
including the important special case of linear sparsity ($k = \Theta(p)$) using
a linear scaling of observations ($n = \Theta(p)$). Our second contribution is
to prove necessary conditions on the number of observations $n$ required for
asymptotically reliable recovery using a class of $\gamma$-sparsified
measurement matrices, where the measurement sparsity $\gamma(n, p, k) \in
(0,1]$ corresponds to the fraction of non-zero entries per row. Our analysis
allows general scaling of the quadruplet $(n, p, k, \gamma)$, and reveals three
different regimes, corresponding to whether measurement sparsity has no effect,
a minor effect, or a dramatic effect on the information-theoretic limits of the
subset recovery problem.

observations of 10 submm-detected QSOs selected at the epoch of peak activity
in both QSOs and submm galaxies (SMGs). CO is detected in 5/6 very optically
luminous (M_B~-28) submm-detected QSOs with BH masses M_BH~10^9-10^10 Msun,
confirming the presence of large gas reservoirs of M_gas~3.4x10^10 Msun.
However, we find that their BH masses are ~30 times too large and their surface
density is ~300 times too small to be related to typical SMGs in an
evolutionary sequence. Conversely, we measure weaker CO emission in four
fainter (M_B~-25) submm-detected QSOs with properties, BH masses (M_BH~5x10^8
Msun), and surface densities similar to SMGs. These QSOs appear to lie near the
local M_BH/M_sph relation, making them plausible `transition objects' in the
proposed evolutionary sequence linking QSOs to the formation of massive young
galaxies and BHs at high-redshift. We show that SMGs have a higher incidence of
bimodal CO line profiles than seen in our QSO sample, which we interpret as an
effect of their relative inclinations, with the QSOs seen more face-on.
Finally, we find that the gas masses of the four fainter submm-detected QSOs
imply that their star formation episodes could be sustained for ~10 Myr, and
are consistent with representing a phase in the formation of massive galaxies
which overlaps a preceding SMG starburst phase, before subsequently evolving
into a population of present-day massive ellipticals. [abridged]

Magellan I/LDSS2 and VLT/VIMOS, as well as deep VLT/FORS1 images in V and I
bands were examined. We identify cluster members by radial velocity
measurements and select other cluster galaxy candidates by their morphology.
One possible UCD candidate with M_V=-13.26 mag is found. Our sample of 100
morphologically selected dwarf galaxies defines a CMR that extends the CMR of
the giant cluster galaxies to the magnitude limit of our survey (M_V~-10 mag).
It matches the relations found for the Local Group and the Fornax cluster
dwarfs almost perfectly. The Hydra I dwarfs also follow a magnitude-surface
brightness relation similar to that of the LG dwarfs. Moreover, we observe a
continuous relation for dwarf galaxies and giant early-type galaxies when
plotting the central surface brightness \mu_0 of a S\'ersic model vs. the
galaxy magnitude. The effective radius is found to be largely independent of
the luminosity for M_V>-18 mag, being R_e~0.8 kpc. We derive a very flat
faint-end slope of the LF (\alpha = -1.13 \pm 0.04) from fitting a Schechter
function, whereas fitting a power law for M_V>-14 mag gives \alpha = -1.40 \pm
0.18. Our findings suggest that early-type dwarf and giant galaxies are the
same class of objects. The similarity of the dwarf galaxy scaling relations to
other environments implies that internal processes could be more important for
their global photometric properties than external influences. (abridged)

star clusters due to two-body relaxation in external tidal fields, using
Aarseth's collisional N-body code NBODY4 on GRAPE6 special-purpose computers.
When extrapolating results of initially not mass segregated models to globular
clusters, we obtain a correlation between the time until destruction and the
slope of the mass function, in the sense that globular clusters which are
closer to dissolution are more strongly depleted in low-mass stars. This
correlation fits observed mass functions of most globular clusters. The mass
functions of several globular clusters are however more strongly depleted in
low-mass stars than suggested by these models. Such strongly depleted mass
functions can be explained if globular clusters started initially mass
segregated. Primordial mass segregation also explains the correlation between
the slope of the stellar mass function and the cluster concentration which was
recently discovered by De Marchi et al. (2007). In this case, it is possible
that all globular clusters started with a mass function similar to that seen in
young open clusters in the present-day universe, at least for stars below m=0.8
Msun. This argues for a near universality of the mass function for different
star formation environments and metallicities in the range -2 < [Fe/H] < 0. We
finally describe a novel algorithm which can initialise stationary mass
segregated clusters with arbitrary density profile and amount of mass
segregation.

responsible for the primordial curvature perturbation. We write down the full
non-linear equations that relate the primordial perturbation to the curvaton
perturbations on large scales, and solve them in a sudden-decay approximation.
We calculate the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation, and finally go
to second order to find the non-linearity parameter, fNL.
  Not surprisingly, we find large positive values of fNL if the energy
densities of the curvatons are sub-dominant when they decay, as in the single
curvaton case. But we also find a novel effect, which can be present only in
multi-curvaton models: fNL becomes large even if the curvatons dominate the
total energy density in the case when the inhomogeneous radiation produced by
the first curvaton decay is diluted by the decay of a second nearly homogeneous
curvaton. The minimum value min(fNL)=-5/4 which we find is the same as in the
single-curvaton case.
  Using (non-)Gaussianity observations, Planck can be able to distinguish
between single-field inflation and curvaton model. Hence it is important to
derive theoretical predictions for curvaton model. From particle physics point
of view it is more natural to assume multiple scalar fields (rather than just
one ``curvaton'' in addition to inflaton). Our work updates the theoretical
predictions of curvaton model to this case.

gravitational wave signal produced during the inspiral phase can be detected by
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and is promptly followed, in an
extended portion of the black hole and white dwarf mass parameter space, by an
electro-magnetic signal generated by the tidal disruption of the star,
detectable with X-ray, optical and UV telescopes. This class of sources could
therefore yield a considerable number of scientific payoffs, that include
precise cosmography at low redshift, demographics of black holes in the mass
range ~10^4-10^5\Msun, insights into dynamical interactions and populations of
white dwarfs in the cores of dwarf galaxies, as well as a new probe into the
structure and equation of state of white dwarfs. By modelling the gravitational

in both observational windows at a distance ~200 Mpc, and possibly beyond for
selected regions of the parameter space. We also estimate the detection rate
for a number of model assumptions about black hole and white dwarf mass
functions and dynamical interactions: the rate is (not surprisingly) highly
uncertain, ranging from ~0.01 yr^-1 to ~100 yr^-1. This is due to the current
limited theoretical understanding and minimal observational constraints for

X-ray binaries (LMXBs) per galaxy in nearby massive early-type galaxies. These
studies have raised important issues regarding the behavior of this population
of remnants of the once massive stars in early-type galaxies, namely the
connection between LMXBs and globular clusters (GCs) and the nature of the LMXB
luminosity function (LF). In this paper, we combine five epochs of Chandra
observations and one central field Hubble Space Telescope Advance Camera for
Surveys observation of NGC 4697, one of the nearest, optically luminous
elliptical (E6) galaxies, to probe the GC-LMXB connection and LMXB-LF down to a
detection/completeness limit of (0.6/1.4) x 10^{37} ergs/s. We detect 158
sources, present their luminosities and hardness ratios, and associate 34 LMXBs
with GCs. We confirm that GCs with higher encounter rates (\Gamma_h) and redder
colors (higher metallicity Z) are more likely to contain GCs, and find that the
expected number of LMXBs per GC is proportional to \Gamma_h^{0.79+0.18/-0.15}
Z^{0.50+0.20/-0.18}, consistent with fainter X-ray sources in Galactic GCs and
LMXBs in Virgo early-type galaxies. Approximately 11+/-2% / 8 +/-2% of GCs in
NGC 4697 contain an LMXB at the detection/completeness limit. We propose that
the larger proportion of metal-rich GCs in NGC 4697 compared to the Milky Way
explains why these fractions are much higher than those of the Milky Way at
similar luminosities. We confirm that a broken power-law is the best fit to the
LMXB-LF, although we cannot rule out a cutoff power-law, and argue that this
raises the possibility that there is no universal form for the LMXB-LF in
early-type galaxies. We find marginal evidence for different LFs of LMXBs in
GCs and the field and different spectra of GC-LMXBs and Field-LMXBs.

five sources with significant variability. Approximately 7% of sources show
variability between any two observations, and 16+/-4% of sources do not have a

identify eleven transient candidates, with which we estimate that if all LMXBs
in NGC 4697 are long-term transients then they are on for ~ 100 yr and have a
7% duty cycle. These numbers are consistent with those found for brighter LMXBs

approached, and diverges exactly at the horizon. In Eddington-Finkelstein
reference frame the temperature at the horizon is finite, since the observer in
that frame is not accelerated. These results are in agreement with what is
generically expected in the absence of backreaction. We also discuss some
subtleties related to the physical interpretation of the infinite local

planetary systems since they provide the widest spectrum of information for
both the planet and the host star. If a transiting planet is on an eccentric
orbit, the duration of transits T_D is sensitive to the orientation of the
orbital ellipse relative to the line of sight. The precession of the orbit
results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit
events and the observed period between successive transits, P_obs. The
periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and
possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession
can be detected through the long-term change in P_obs (transit timing
variations, TTV) or in T_D (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the
corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations
of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ
436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV

can be orders of magnitude larger than the magnitude of the same effect for
Mercury. The realization that some of the close-in exoplanets have significant
eccentricities raises the possibility that this precession might be detectable.
We explore in this work the observability of the periastra precession using
radial velocity and transit light curve observations. Our analysis is
independent of the source of precession, which can also have significant
contributions due to additional planets and tidal deformations. We find that
precession of the periastra of the magnitude expected from general relativity
can be detectable in timescales of <~ 10 years with current observational
capabilities by measuring the change in the primary transit duration or in the
time difference between primary and secondary transits. Radial velocity curves
alone would be able to detect this precession for super-massive, close-in
exoplanets orbiting inactive stars if they have ~100 datapoints at each of two
epochs separated by ~20 years. We show that the contribution to the precession
by tidal deformations may dominate the total precession in cases where the
relativistic precession is detectable. Studies of transit durations with Kepler
might need to take into account effects arising from the general relativistic
and tidal induced precession of periastra for systems containing close-in,
eccentric exoplanets. Such studies may be able to detect additional planets
with masses comparable to that of Earth by detecting secular variations in the

combination of an entrance pupil apodizer and an opaque mask in the following

pupil stop. Our goal is to stress the interest of using this coronagraphic
solution, in particular for instruments for which the introduction of a stellar
coronagraph with Lyot stop is made impossible. We estimate the intensity
attenuation achieved with SLLC and carry out our study with a focus on the case
of Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). In a first step, numerical simulations are
made assuming the absence of any aberration, thereafter SLLC performance is
evaluated considering AO corrected wavefronts in our approach for ground-based
instruments. SLLC performance proves to be equivalent to that obtained with
APLC in presence of AO compensated atmospheric turbulence images, which Strehl
ratio is S=0.552 at the wavelength lambda=1.57 mu m. This coronagraph allows to
remove the peak intensity of a star image and therefore, avoid detector
saturation. Moreover, it helps increasing the image dynamic range. A mean

APLC reaches a value Delta m=0.38.

WENSS and 12,000 by GB6. About one third of each sample is detected by SDSS. An
automated classification method based on 20 cm fluxes defines three radio
morphology classes: complex, resolved, and compact. Radio color-magnitude-
morphology diagrams for these classes show structure suggestive of strong
underlying physical correlations. Complex and resolved sources tend to have a
steep spectral slope (alpha ~ -0.8) that is nearly constant from 6 to 92 cm,
while the compact class contains a significant number of flat-spectrum (alpha ~
0) sources. In the optically-detected sample, quasars dominate the
flat-spectrum compact sources while steep-spectrum and resolved objects contain
substantial numbers of both quasars and galaxies. Differential radio counts of
quasars and galaxies are similar at bright flux levels (>100 mJy at 20 cm),
while at fainter levels the quasar counts are significantly reduced below
galaxy counts. The optically-undetected sample is strongly biased toward
steep-spectrum sources. In samples of quasars and galaxies with SDSS spectra,

loudness are correlated with optical color and luminosity.

that the replenishment may occur naturally through gas infall, although
measured rates of gas infall in nearby galaxies are insufficient to match
consumption. We identify an alternative mechanism for this replenishment,
associated with expanding supershells within galaxies. Pre-existing ionized gas
can cool and recombine efficiently in the walls of supershells, molecular gas
can form in situ in shell walls, and shells can compress pre-existing molecular
clouds to trigger collapse and star formation. We show that this mechanism

them, the class of unlabeled (2+2)-free posets and a certain class of
involutions (or chord diagrams), already appeared in the literature, but were
apparently not known to be equinumerous. We present a direct bijection between
them. The third class is a family of permutations defined in terms of a new
type of pattern. An attractive property of these patterns is that, like
classical patterns, they are closed under the action of $D_8$, the symmetry
group of the square. The fourth class is formed by certain integer sequences,
called ascent sequences, which have a simple recursive structure and are shown
to encode (2+2)-free posets and permutations. Our bijections preserve numerous
statistics.
  We determine the generating function of these classes of objects, thus
recovering a non-D-finite series obtained by Zagier for the class of chord
diagrams. Finally, we characterize the ascent sequences that correspond to
permutations avoiding the barred pattern $3{\bar 1}52{\bar 4}$ and use this to
enumerate those permutations, thereby settling a conjecture of Pudwell.

cognitive radio (CR) link and a primary radio (PR) link. It is assumed that the
CR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called
interference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit
regardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference
power level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the
fading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver
is usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average
interference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to
limit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's
perspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP
constraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more
flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states.
On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more
restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than
the AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of
capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and
outage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This
result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e.,
randomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more
advantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the
resultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger
fading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.

become larger with the increasing of the system-size. It may also support the

morphology of ionomers describe Nafion as an aggregation of polymeric backbone
chains forming elongated objects embedded in a continuous ionic medium.
Uniaxial stretching of a recast Nafion film causes a preferential orientation
of these objects in the direction of stretching. Our simulations of humid
Nafion show that this has a strong effect on the proton conductivity, which is
enhanced along the stretching direction, while the conductivity perpendicular
to the stretched polymer backbone is reduced. Stretching also causes the
perfluorinated side chains to orient perpendicular to the stretching axis.
  This in turn affects the distribution of water at low water contents. The
water forms a continuous network with narrow bridges between small water
clusters absorbed in head-group multiplets.

  Estimation","23 pages, 9 figures, technical report, related paper under submission",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In block-matching motion estimation (BMME), the search patterns have a
significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and
the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion
vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world
sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to
describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution
and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more
exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen
popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by
utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search
patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the
horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical
diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is
called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS
algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or
HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on
speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%. The simulation results show
that DCDS is efficient, effective and robust, and it can always give the faster
search speed on different sequences than other fast block-matching algorithm in
common use.

generate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize
the dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory
theories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key
properties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level
cortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase
transitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase
transitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe
this LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the
corresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able
to rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common
LSF--manifold. The model yields substantial qualitative differences in
geometrical properties between bilateral and multi-lateral co-action due to
intrinsic chaotic coupling between $n$ actors when $n\geq 3$.

the signal-to-noise ratio was too low. The observed temperature trend in
western Europe over the last decades appears much stronger than simulated by
state-of-the-art GCMs. The difference is very unlikely due to random

important; in spring and summer changes in soil moisture and cloud cover. A
misrepresentation of the North Atlantic Current affects trends along the coast.

acts mainly due to two mechanisms: gravitational drag by stellar encounters and
evaporation by strong stellar winds and radiation. If encounters play a role in
disc destruction, one would expect that stars devoid of disc material would
show unexpectedly high velocities as an outcome of close interactions. We want
to quantify this effect by numerical simulations and compare it to
observations. As a model cluster we chose the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We
found from the observational data that 8 to 18 stars leave the ONC with
velocities several times the velocity dispersion. The majority of these
high-velocity stars are young low-mass stars, among them several lacking
infrared excess emission. Interestingly, the high-velocity stars are found only
in two separate regions of the ONC. Our simulations give an explanation for the
location of the high-velocity stars and provide evidence for a strong
correlation between location and disc destruction. The high-velocity stars can
be explained as the outcome of close three-body encounters; the partial lack of
disc signatures is attributed to gravitational interaction. The spatial
distribution of the high-velocity stars reflects the initial structure and
dynamics of the ONC. Our approach can be generalized to study the evolution of
other young dense star clusters, like the Arches cluster, back in time.

significantly larger than in the Sun. They are compared with those computed
with an excitation model that includes two sources of driving, the Reynolds
stress contribution and the advection of entropy fluctuations. The model also
uses a closure model, the Closure Model with Plumes (CMP hereafter), that takes
the asymmetry between the up- and down-flows (i.e. the granules and plumes,
respectively) into account. Different prescriptions for the eddy-time
correlation function are also confronted to observational data. Calculations
based on a Gaussian eddy-time correlation underestimate excitation rates
compared with the values derived from observations for Alpha Cen A. On the
other hand, calculations based on a Lorentzian eddy-time correlation lie within
the observational error bars. This confirms results obtained in the solar case.
With respect to the helioseismic data, those obtained for Alpha Cen A
constitute an additional support for our model of excitation. We show that mode
masses must be computed taking turbulent pressure into account. Finally, we
emphasize the need for more accurate seismic measurements in order to
discriminate, in the case of Alpha Cen A, between the CMP closure model and the
quasi-Normal Approximation as well as to confirm or not the need to include the

that the dark matter and gas distributions are indistinguishable as

we develop an effective Bayesian analysis connected with information theory,
which clearly demonstrates that the gas is biased in a long range of scales, up

Within a parton recombination approach we show that a negative elliptic flow
puts a lower limit on the collective transverse velocity of heavy quarks. The

for period of the cycle. It was found that dynamo cycles of fully convective

long term activity of the star is not periodic process. Rather one can speak
about quasi cyclic activity with characteristic time of $\sim 4$ yr and chaotic

over longitude is the reason of long term variations of V410 Tau brightness. It
means that one can not compare directly results of photometric observations

methods, we compute the \emph{average nucleation time} (= the first time a
critical droplet appears and starts growing) up to a multiplicative factor that
tends to one as $\b\to\infty$. It turns out that this time grows as
$Ke^{\Gamma\b}/|\L_\b|$ for Glauber dynamics and $K\b e^{\Gamma\b}/|\L_\b|$ for
Kawasaki dynamics, where $\Gamma$ is the local canonical, respectively,
grand-canonical energy to create a critical droplet and $K$ is a constant
reflecting the geometry of the critical droplet, provided these times tend to
infinity (which puts a growth restriction on $|\L_\b|$). The fact that the
average nucleation time is inversely proportional to $|\L_\b|$ is referred to
as \emph{homogeneous nucleation}, because it says that the critical droplet for
the transition appears essentially independently in small boxes that partition
$\L_\b$.

scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or

entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the
water change dramatically. While some work has been done to study
small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures, little work has been done on
large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We propose a basic two-fluid model in

It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water wave impacts on
coastal structures. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order
finite volume method. Numerical results are presented for two examples: the dam

theory for back-tracing the orbits of O-type stars and of candidate parent open
clusters. Results: From the 370 O-stars in the ``Galactic O star catalog v
2.0'' (GOSV2) we have investigated 93 stars classified as ""field"", and found
the origin for 73 of them in 48 open clusters younger than 30 Myrs. Only for 32
stars or about 9% of all O-stars from this catalogue, the question of their
origin in groups is not solved; some of them may have originated in isolation
or may have disintegrated the group in which they formed. Fifty percent of the
young open clusters (age < 30 Myr) in the ``Catalogue of Open Cluster Data''

first 10 Myrs of their life, or both. During this period the average mass loss
from open clusters by ejecting O-stars is found to be 3 to 5 M_Sun per Myr. We
prove that zeta Pup had its origin in the open cluster Trumpler 10 which it
left about 2.5 Myrs ago, and that its present-day distance is 300 pc (compared
to 440 pc before). The revised distance implies a significant revision of the
stellar parameters (a radius of 14 R_Sun, a mass of 22.5 M_Sun, and a
luminosity of log L/L_Sun of 5.74) i.e, zeta Pup is closer, less massive, and
less luminous than previously thought. Our findings provide independent
estimates of the present-day distances and absolute magnitudes of field
O-stars.

However, the amount of energy required for emission is smaller for atoms

corner ion in an alkali halide cube the binding is the weakest, so it should be
easier to remove that atom, once it is neutralized. We carried out first

that detachment of neutral Cl corner atoms will require a limited energy of
about 0.8 eV. Conversely, following the donation of an excess electron to the

about 0.6 eV. Since the cube electron affinity level (close to that a NaCl(100)

improved the servo system algorithm which now controls the mirror displacement

small Atwood numbers is studied by means of a phase-field description. In this
method the sharp fluid interface is replaced by a thin, yet finite, transition
layer where the interfacial forces vary smoothly. This is achieved by
introducing an order parameter (the phase field) whose variation is continuous
across the interfacial layers and is uniform in the bulk region. The phase
field model obeys a Cahn--Hilliard equation and is two-way coupled to the
standard Navier--Stokes equations. Starting from this system of equations we
have first performed a linear analysis from which we have analytically
rederived the known gravity-capillary dispersion relation in the limit of
vanishing mixing energy density and capillary width. We have performed
numerical simulations and identified a region of parameters in which the known
properties of the linear phase (both stable and unstable) are reproduced in a
very accurate way. This has been done both in the case of negligible viscosity
and in the case of nonzero viscosity. In the latter situation only upper and
lower bounds for the perturbation growth-rate are known. Finally, we have also
investigated the weakly-nonlinear stage of the perturbation evolution and
identified a regime characterized by a constant terminal velocity of
bubbles/spikes. The measured value of the terminal velocity is in perfect
agreement with available theoretical prediction. The phase-field approach thus
appears to be a valuable tecnhique for the dynamical description of the stages
where hydrodynamic turbulence and wave-turbulence enter into play.

of pressure on big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), we explore the effect of
pressure's self-gravity on the structure of neutron stars. We construct an ad
hoc modification of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation wherein pressure's
self-gravity is parameterized by a constant, $\chi$, with $0 \le \chi \le 1$.
The full general relativistic contribution to the gravity of pressure is
recovered with $\chi = 1$, and is eliminated when $\chi = 0$. This formulation
is not proposed as an alternative theory of gravity, but is merely used to
quantify the extent to which the self-gravity of pressure contributes to the
structure of dense objects. As can be surmised qualitatively, neutron star
masses can be quite sensitive to $\chi$, with higher values of neutron-star
mass (by $\sim$20--25%) allowed for smaller values of $\chi$. However, for a
given equation of state, neither the range of neutron star radii nor the radii
at fixed central density depend sensitively on $\chi$. Over the neutron star
mass range measured so far, the presence or absence of pressure's self-gravity
yields a nearly immeasurable change in radius -- much smaller than the
variations in radius due to the uncertainty in the equation of state. In
contrast to the result for BBN, we thus find that neutron stars are not likely
to be useful testbeds for examining the self-gravity of pressure.

quantization corresponds to a functor between two certain categories. At the
abstract level, the ordinary fields, could be thought as natural
transformations in the sense of category theory. We show that, the Wick
monomials without derivatives (Wick powers), can be interpreted as fields in
this generalized sense, provided a non trivial choice of the renormalization
constants is given. A careful analysis shows that the transformation law of
Wick powers is characterized by a weight, and it turns out that the sum of
fields with different weights breaks the conformal covariance. At this point
there is a difference between the previously given picture due to the presence
of a bigger group of covariance. It is furthermore shown that the construction
does not depend upon the scale mu appearing in the Hadamard parametrix, used to
regularize the fields. Finally, we briefly discuss some further examples of
more involved fields.

the bright filaments of sunspot penumbrae. Expectations are high that such
dark-cored filaments are the basic building blocks of the penumbra, but their
nature remains unknown.
  Aims: We investigate the origin of dark cores in penumbral filaments and the
surplus brightness of the penumbra. To that end we use an uncombed penumbral
model.
  Methods: The 2D stationary heat transfer equation is solved in a stratified
atmosphere consisting of nearly horizontal magnetic flux tubes embedded in a
stronger and more vertical field. The tubes carry an Evershed flow of hot
plasma.
  Results: This model produces bright filaments with dark cores as a
consequence of the higher density of the plasma inside the tubes, which shifts
the surface of optical depth unity toward higher (cooler) layers. Our
calculations suggest that the surplus brightness of the penumbra is a natural
consequence of the Evershed flow, and that magnetic flux tubes about 250 km in
diameter can explain the morphology of sunspot penumbrae.

mass spectrum were observed and are attributed to the production of
f2(1270)/a02(1320), f'2(1525) and f0(1710). Masses and widths were obtained
using a fit which takes into account theoretical predictions based on SU(3)
symmetry arguments, and are consistent with the PDG values. The f0(1710) state,
which has a mass consistent with a glueball candidate, was observed with a
statistical significance of 5 standard deviations. However, if this state is
the same as that seen in gamma gamma -> K0SK0S, it is unlikely to be a pure
glueball state.
