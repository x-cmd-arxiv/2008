models with a general kinetic term. The models include the multi-field
K-inflation and the multi-field Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation as special
cases. We find that, in general, the sound speeds for the adiabatic and entropy
perturbations are different and they can be smaller than 1. Then the
non-gaussianity can be enhanced. The multi-field DBI-inflation is shown to be a
special case where both sound speeds are the same due to a special form of the
kinetic term. We derive the exact second and third order actions including
metric perturbations. In the small sound speed limit and at leading order in
the slow-roll expansion, we derive the three point function for the curvature
perturbation which depends on both adiabatic and entropy perturbations. The
contribution from the entropy perturbations has a different momentum dependence
if the sound speed for the entropy perturbations is different from the
adiabatic one, which provides a possibility to distinguish the multi-field
models from single field models. On the other hand, in the multi-field DBI
case, the contribution from the entropy perturbations has the same momentum
dependence as the pure adiabatic contributions and it only changes the
amplitude of the three point function. This could help to ease the constraints
on the DBI-inflation models.

with matched optical and mid-IR photometry taken from the Subaru XMM Deep

construct a K-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts.
Excluding stars, objects with uncertain z_phot solutions, those that fall in
bad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-frame
colors could not be derived, 30108 galaxies with K<22.4 (AB) and z<2.5 remain.
The galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in the
rest-frame U-V vs. V-J color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies
(analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extending
from blue to red U-V colors. This bimodal behavior is seen up to z~2. Due to a
combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color
diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z>2 for this
sample, but we show that MIPS 24um data suggest that a significant population
of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z=1-2, the most
luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming
and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies
are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered
more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with
early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos.
This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps
brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.

mechanism also requires, however, that the two Higgs doublets are strictly
vector-like under all underlying gauge symmetries, and consequently there is a
limit in a class of modes and their phenomenology for which the Wilson line can
be used. An alternative is to turn on a non-flat line bundle in the U(1)_Y
direction on an internal manifold, which does not have to be non-simply
connected. The U(1)_Y gauge field has to remain in the massless spectrum, and
its coupling has to satisfy the GUT relation. In string theory
compactifications, however, it is not that easy to satisfy these conditions in
a natural way; we call it U(1)_Y problem. In this article, we explain how the
problem is solved in some parts of moduli space of string theory
compactifications. Two major ingredients are an extra strongly coupled U(1)
gauge field and parametrically large volume for compactification that is also
essential in accounting for the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the GUT
scale. Heterotic-M theory vacua and F-theory vacua are discussed. This article
also shows that the toroidal orbifold GUT approach using discrete Wilson lines
corresponds to the non-flat line-bundle breaking above when orbifold
singularities are blown up. Thus, the orbifold GUT approach also suffers from
the U(1)_Y problem, and this article shows how to fix it.

the sigma properties we obtain results which are less dependent on the
parameterization than in the standard local NJL model, and which are in
reasonable agreement with the recently reported empirical values. We also show
that the inclusion of the WFR tend to improve the description of the $\pi-\pi$

crucial planetesimals-to-embryos phase. Our code computes the relative velocity
distribution, and thus the accretion vs. fragmentation trend, of planetesimal
populations having any given size distribution. This is a critical aspect of
planet formation in binaries since the pericenter alignment of planetesimal
orbits due to the gravitational perturbations of the companion star and to gas
friction strongly depends on size. We find that, for the nominal case of a MMSN
gas disc, the region beyond 0.5AU from the primary is hostile to planetesimal
accretion. In this area, impact velocities between different-size bodies are
increased, by the differential orbital phasing, to values too high to allow
mutual accretion. For any realistic size distribution for the planetesimal
population, this accretion-inhibiting effect is the dominant collision outcome
and the accretion process is halted. Results are robust with respect to the
profile and density of the gas disc: except for an unrealistic almost gas-free
case, the inner accretion safe area never extends beyond 0.75AU. We conclude
that planet formation is very difficult in the terrestrial region around alpha
Cen A, unless it started from fast-formed very large (>30km) planetesimals.
Notwithstanding these unlikely initial conditions, the only possible
explanation for the presence of planets around 1 AU from the star would be the
hypothetical outward migration of planets formed closer to the star or a
different orbital configuration in the binary's early history. Our conclusions
differ from those of several studies focusing on the later embryos-to-planets
stage, confirming that the planetesimals-to-embryos phase is more affected by
binary perturbations.

adapting the grid description of the fields and moments and adapting the

issues. First, we describe how grid adaptation can be guided by appropriate
measures of the local accuracy of the solution. Based on such information, grid
adaptation can be obtained by moving grid points from regions of lesser
interest to regions of higher interest or by adding and removing points. We
discuss both strategies. Second, we describe how to adapt the local number of
particles to reach the required statistical variance in the description of the

shown: collisionless shocks and charging of small bodies immersed in a plasma.

possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Its particular
robustness however comes with one major difficulty: it will be very hard if not
impossible to test experimentally in a foreseeable future, as most of the
mechanics typically takes place at high energy or results from suppressed
interactions, without unavoidable low-energy implications. An alternate
approach is taken by asking: can it be at least falsified? We show that
possible discoveries at current and future colliders, most notably that of
right-handed gauge interactions, would indeed forbid at least the ""canonical""
leptogenesis mechanisms, namely those based on right-handed neutrino decay.
General lower bounds for successful leptogenesis on the mass of the
right-handed gauge boson W_R are given. Other possibilities to falsify
leptogenesis, including from the observation of a Z', are also considered.

different for both type of objects, but at infinity it could be difficult to
discern black holes from their mimickers. To disentangle this possible
confusion, we examine the near-horizon properties, and their connection with
far away properties, of some candidates to black mimickers. We study
spherically symmetric uncharged or charged but non-extremal objects, as well as
spherically symmetric charged extremal objects. Within the uncharged or charged
but non-extremal black hole mimickers, we study non-extremal
$\epsilon$-wormholes on the threshold of the formation of an event horizon, of
which a subclass are called black foils, and gravastars. Within the charged
extremal black hole mimickers we study extremal $\epsilon$-wormholes on the
threshold of the formation of an event horizon, quasi-black holes, and
wormholes on the basis of quasi-black holes from Bonnor stars. We elucidate,
whether or not the objects belonging to these two classes remain regular in the
near-horizon limit. The requirement of full regularity, i.e., finite curvature
and absence of naked behavior, up to an arbitrary neighborhood of the
gravitational radius of the object enables one to rule out potential mimickers
in most of the cases. A list ranking the best mimickers up to the worse is
given. Since, in observational astrophysics it is difficult to find extremal
configurations (the best mimickers in the ranking), whereas non-extremal

into the $M$-$T_{\rm X}$ relation, using a sample of 121 galaxy clusters

statistics previously proposed to measure X-ray surface brightness
substructure. These are the centroid variation ($w$), the axial ratio ($\eta$),

radius R_p = 4.90 +0.45/-0.33 R_earth. The radius we determine for the planet
is larger than the previous findings from analyses of an infrared light curve
obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Although this discrepancy has a 92%
formal significance (1.7 sigma), it might be indicative of systematic errors
that still influence the analyses of even the highest-precision transit light
curves. Comparisons of all the measured radii to theoretical models suggest
that GJ436b has a H/He envelope of ~10% by mass. We also find that the transit
times for GJ436b are constant to within 10 s over the 11 planetary orbits that
the HST data span. However, the ensemble of published values exhibits a
long-term drift and our mean transit time is 128 s later than that expected
from the Spitzer ephemeris. The sparseness of the currently available data
hinders distinguishing between an error in the orbital period or perturbations
arising from an additional object in the system as the cause of the apparent
trend. Assuming the drift is due to an error in the orbital period we obtain an
improved estimate for it of P = 2.643904 +/- 0.000005 d. This value and our
measured transit times will serve as important benchmarks in future studies of
the GJ436 system. (abridged)

low to be explained by `canonical' cluster models, in which dynamical effects
are not accounted for. Moreover, these models do not reproduce a recently
reported trend of increasing M/L with cluster mass, but instead predict
mass-to-light ratios that are independent of cluster mass for a fixed age and
metallicity. This study aims to explain the M/L of globular clusters in four
galaxies by including stellar evolution, stellar remnants, and the preferential
loss of low-mass stars due to energy equipartition. Analytical cluster models
are applied that account for stellar evolution and dynamical cluster
dissolution to samples of globular clusters in Cen A, the Milky Way, M31 and
the LMC. The models include stellar remnants and cover metallicities in the
range Z=0.0004-0.05. Both the low observed mass-to-light ratios and the trend
of increasing M/L with cluster mass can be reproduced by including the
preferential loss of low-mass stars, assuming reasonable values for the
dissolution timescale. This leads to a mass-dependent M/L evolution and
increases the explained percentage of the observations from 39% to 92%. This
study shows that the hitherto unexplained discrepancy between observations and
models of the mass-to-light ratios of globular clusters can be explained by
dynamical effects, provided that the globular clusters exhibiting low M/L have
dissolution timescales within the ranges assumed in this Letter. Furthermore,
it substantiates that M/L cannot be assumed to be constant with mass at fixed
age and metallicity.

By using the generalized Abel-Plana formula, in this paper we derive a

function of the first kind with respect to the degree. The summation formula
for the series over the zeros of the Bessel function, previously discussed in
the literature, is obtained as a limiting case. The Wightman function for a
scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter is considered inside a
spherical boundary on background of constant negative curvature space. The
corresponding mode sum contains series over the zeros of the associated
Legendre function. The application of the summation formula allows us to
present the Wightman function in the form of the sum of two integrals. The
first one corresponds to the Wightman function for the bulk geometry without
boundaries and the second one is induced by the presence of the spherical
shell. For points away from the boundary the latter is finite in the
coincidence limit. In this way the renormalization of the vacuum expectation

observational foundation for the XMM-Newton Distant Cluster Project (XDCP).
This new serendipitous survey is focused on the most distant systems at z>1,
based on the selection of extended X-ray sources, their identification as
clusters via two-band imaging, and their final spectroscopic confirmation.
Almost 1000 extended sources were selected as cluster candidates from the
analysis of 80 deg^2 of deep XMM-Newton archival data, of which 75% could be
readily identified as systems at z<~0.6. For the remaining 250 distant cluster
candidates a new strategy for their confirmation and redshift estimates was
adopted, based on Z- and H-band photometry and the observed Z-H red-sequence
color of early-type cluster galaxies. From observations of 25% of the sample,
more than 20 X-ray clusters were discovered at a photometric redshift of
z>~0.9. The new Z-H method has allowed a cluster sample study over an
unprecedented redshift baseline of 0.2<~z<~1.5. From a comparison of the
observed color evolution of the red-sequence with model predictions, the
formation epoch of early-type galaxies could be constrained as z_f=4.2+-1.1,
confirming their well-established old age. The preliminary investigation of the
H-band luminosity evolution of 63 BCGs provides for the first time direct
observational indications that the most massive cluster galaxies have doubled
their stellar mass since z~1.5. The finding that BCGs were assembled in the
last 9Gyr is now in qualitative agreement with the latest simulations.

negligible amount of warm gas 10^5K < T < 10^6K; (8) the gas is unlikely
illuminated by the foreground quasar, implying anisotropic or intermittent

significant, amounting to a few percent of the total expected baryonic mass

stars in globular and old open clusters. Hydrodynamical simulations have shown
that the remnants of such collisions are out of thermal equilibrium, are not
strongly mixed and can rotate very rapidly.
  Detailed evolution models of collision products are needed to interpret
observed blue straggler populations and to use them to probe the dynamical
history of a star cluster. We expand on previous studies by presenting an
efficient procedure to import the results of detailed collision simulations
into a fully implicit stellar evolution code. Our code is able to evolve
stellar collision products in a fairly robust manner and allows for a
systematic study of their evolution.
  Using our code we have constructed detailed models of the collisional blue
stragglers produced in the $N$-body simulation of M67 performed by Hurley
\emph{et al.} in 2005. We assume the collisions are head-on and thus ignore the
effects of rotation in this paper.
  Our detailed models are more luminous than normal stars of the same mass and
in the same stage of evolution, but cooler than homogeneously mixed versions of
the collision products. The increased luminosity and inefficient mixing
decrease the remaining main-sequence lifetimes of the collision products, which
are much shorter than predicted by the simple prescription commonly used in
$N$-body simulations.

extend this work by studying the evolution of the collision products in open
clusters as a function of mass and age of the progenitor stars.
  We calculated a grid of head-on collisions covering the section of parameter
space relevant for collisions in open clusters. We create detailed models of
the merger remnants using an entropy-sorting algorithm and follow their
subsequent evolution during the initial contraction phase, through the main
sequence and up to the giant branch with our detailed stellar evolution code.
  We compare the location of our models in a colour-magnitude diagram to the
observed blue straggler population of the old open clusters M67 and NGC 188 and
find that they cover the observed blue straggler region of both clusters. For
M67, collisions need to have taken place recently. Differences between the
evolution tracks of the collision products and normal main sequence stars can
be understood quantitatively using a simple analytic model. We present an
analytic recipe that can be used in an $N$-body code to transform a precomputed

surrounding field. We detect three main diffuse components: the Virgo ICM at
~2.4 keV, the extended halo of M86 at ~1.2 keV, and the cooler central and
stripped gas of M86 at ~0.8 keV. The most striking feature is a long tail of
emission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of M86 and two main extensions
emanating from the plume. Based on the morphology and temperature structure of
the tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of M86 as it
falls into the Virgo cluster and interacts with the Virgo ICM, in agreement
with earlier work. The tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimate
gives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this the
longest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. The total gas mass in the
plume (7x10^8 M_sun) and tail (1x10^9 M_sun) is about three times that in the
core of M86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was stripped
rapidly and recently. The projected position of the plume can be understood if
M86 has an aspherical potential, as suggested by optical isophotes. Ram
pressure stripping from an aspherical potential can also explain the split
""double tails"" seen in M86 and in other Virgo cluster galaxies in the field.
The large line-of-sight velocity of M86 (1550 km/s with respect to M87), its
position relative to the Virgo cluster, and the orientation of the tail tightly
constrain its orbital parameters. The data are inconsistent with a radial
orbit, and imply inner and outer turning radii of r_i ~ 300 kpc and r_o > 8.8
Mpc, indicating that M86 is, at best, only weakly bound to the Virgo cluster.

perform direct optical identification of SMGs by searching for BzKs around

obtain the current best estimate on the surface density of BzK-selected SMGs,

disk-like galaxies at z~ 2 as indicated by the correlation between their star
formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass and also by dynamical properties, SMGs
are likely to be merging BzKs. In this case, a typical enhancement of SFR due
to merging is only a factor of ~ 3, which is an order of magnitude lower than
that of local ULIRGs. This may indicate that most of the merging BzKs could be

least it would be higher than the fraction at z> 1 of ~ 10 per cent), it is
rather puzzling to find such a low fraction of SMGs in the progenitor

retrieved up to a projective transformation, from corresponding configurations
in a pair of camera images. Consequently, the projective shape of a 3D

to increase spectrum utilization by exploiting unused spectrum in dynamically

fading channels. More specifically, we allow the secondary-to-primary and
secondary-to-secondary user channels to undergo Rayleigh or Rician fading, with
arbitrary link power. In order to compute the capacity, we derive the
distributions of ratios of Rayleigh and Rician variables. Compared to the

metrics that have been evaluated for certain specific types of wireless
networks. However, there is a lack of comprehensive results for larger classes
of networks, and there is no systematic approach that permits the convenient
comparison of the performance of networks with different geometries and levels
of randomness.
  The uncertainty cube is introduced to categorize the uncertainty present in a
network. The three axes of the cube represent the three main potential sources
of uncertainty in interference-limited networks: the node distribution, the
channel gains (fading), and the channel access (set of transmitting nodes). For
the performance analysis, a new parameter, the so-called {\em spatial
contention}, is defined. It measures the slope of the outage probability in an
ALOHA network as a function of the transmit probability $p$ at $p=0$. Outage is
defined as the event that the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is below a
certain threshold in a given time slot. It is shown that the spatial contention
is sufficient to characterize outage and throughput in large classes of
wireless networks, corresponding to different positions on the uncertainty
cube. Existing results are placed in this framework, and new ones are derived.
  Further, interpreting the outage probability as the SIR distribution, the
ergodic capacity of unit-distance links is determined and compared to the
throughput achievable for fixed (yet optimized) transmission rates.

photospheric, near-star, and outflow regions of the late-B supergiant (SG) HD
199478. The analysis is based primarily on optical spectroscopic datasets
secured between 1999 and 2000 from the Bulgarian NAO, Tartu, and Ritter
Observatories. The temporal behaviour of HD 199478 is characterised by three
key empirical properties: (i) systematic central velocity shifts in the
photospheric absorption lines, including C II and He I, over a characteristic
time-scale of abou 20 days; (ii) extremely strong, variable H alpha emission
with no clear modulation signal, and (iii) the occurrence in 2000 of a (rare)
high-velocity absorption (HVA) event in H alpha, which evolved over about 60
days, showing the clear signature of mass infall and outflows. In these
properties HD 199478 resembles few other late-B SGs with peculiar emission and
HVAs in H alpha (HD 91619, HD 34085, HD 96919). Non-LTE line synthesis
modelling is conducted using FASTWIND for these late-B SGs to constrain and
compare their fundamental parameters within the context of extreme behaviour in
the H alpha lines. Our analysis indicate that at the cooler temperature edge of
B SGs, there are objects whose wind properties, as traced by H alpha, are
inconsistent with the predictions of the smooth, spherically symmetric wind
approximation. This discordance is still not fully understood and may highlight
the role of a non-spherical, disk-like, geometry, which may result from
magnetically-driven equatorial compression of the gas. Ordered dipole magnetic
fields may also lead to confined plasma held above the stellar surface, which
ultimately gives rise to transient HVA events.

probes of cosmology. We explore the distance and growth factor measurements
from photometric BAO and WL techniques and investigate the roles of the
distance and growth factor in constraining dark energy. We find for WL that the
growth factor has a great impact on dark energy constraints but is much less
powerful than the distance. Dark energy constraints from WL are concentrated in
considerably fewer distance eigenmodes than those from BAO, with the largest
contributions from modes that are sensitive to the absolute distance. Both
techniques have some well determined distance eigenmodes that are not very
sensitive to the dark energy equation of state parameters w_0 and w_a,
suggesting that they can accommodate additional parameters for dark energy and
for the control of systematic uncertainties. A joint analysis of BAO and WL is
far more powerful than either technique alone, and the resulting constraints on
the distance and growth factor will be useful for distinguishing dark energy
and modified gravity models. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will
yield both WL and angular BAO over a sample of several billion galaxies. Joint
LSST BAO and WL can yield 0.5% level precision on ten comoving distances evenly
spaced in log(1+z) between redshift 0.3 and 3 with cosmic microwave background
priors from Planck. In addition, since the angular diameter distance, which
directly affects the observables, is linked to the comoving distance solely by
the curvature radius in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric solution, LSST
can achieve a pure metric constraint of 0.017 on the mean curvature parameter
Omega_k of the universe simultaneously with the constraints on the comoving
distances.

flows in galaxy clusters is reexamined. Recent investigations have shown that
the anisotropic Coulomb heat flux caused by a magnetic field in a dilute plasma
drives a dynamical instability. A long standing problem of cooling flow theory
has been to understand how thermal conduction can offset radiative core losses
without completely preventing them. In this Letter we propose that
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the heat flux instability regulates
field-line insulation and drives a reverse convective thermal flux, both of
which may mediate the stabilization of the cooling cores of hot clusters. This
model suggests that turbulent mixing should accompany strong thermal gradients
in cooling flows. This prediction seems to be supported by the spatial
distribution of metals in the central galaxies of clusters, which shows a much
stronger correlation with the ambient hot gas temperature gradient than with
the parent stellar population.

observational programme designed to return a large, high-resolution

  Aims: A critical part of our follow-up programme is to conduct 13CO molecular
line observations in order to determine kinematic distances to all of our MYSO
candidates. These distances will allow us to identify and remove nearby
low-mass YSOs and help in identifying evolved stars which are weak CO emitters.
  Method: We have used the 15 m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the 13.7
m telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), the 20 m Onsala telescope
and the 22m Mopra telescope to conduct molecular line observations towards 508
MYSOs candidates located in the 1st and 2nd Quadrants.
  Results: We detect 13CO emission towards 780 RMS sources which corresponds to
approximately 84% of those observed (911). A total of 2595 emission components
are detected above 3sigma level (typically T^*_{\rm{A}} > 0.3K), with multiple
components being observed towards the majority of these sources -- 520 sources
(~56%) -- with an average of ~4 molecular clouds detected along each line of
sight. We have used archival CS (J=2-1) and maser velocities to resolve the
component multiplicity towards 175 sources (~20%) and have derived a criterion
which is used to identify the most likely component for a further 191 multiple
component sources. Combined with the single component detections we have
obtained unambiguous kinematic velocities for 638 of the 780 MYSOs candidates

Once the kink crystal begins to move under the Galilean boost, the spin-density
accumulation occurs inside each kink and there emerges periodic arrays of the
induced magnetic dipoles carrying the transport spin current. The coherent
motion of the kink crystal dynamically generates the spontaneous
demagnetization field. This mechanism is analogous to the

Dirac's canonical formulation for the singular Lagrangian system, we derived
the closed formulae for the mass, spin current and induced magnetic dipole

power spectrum to the accuracy required by future generation surveys. Here, a
new approach is presented, in which the power spectrum, the bispectrum and
higher order correlations, are obtained -- at any redshift and for any momentum
scale -- by integrating a system of differential equations. The method is
similar to the familiar BBGKY hierarchy. Truncating at the level of the
trispectrum, the solution of the equations corresponds to the summation of an
infinite class of perturbative corrections. Compared to other resummation
frameworks, the scheme discussed here is particularly suited to cosmologies
other than LambdaCDM, such as those based on modifications of gravity and those
containing massive neutrinos. As a first application, we compute the Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillation feature of the power spectrum, and compare the results
with perturbation theory, the halo model, and N-body simulations. The
density-velocity and velocity-velocity power spectra are also computed, showing
that they are much less contaminated by nonlinearities than the density-density
one. The approach can be seen as a particular formulation of the
renormalization group, in which time is the flow parameter.

cell of the considered quantum crystalline phase. SLQCSs accurately reproduce
the low density behaviour of the quantum crystals that, as Wigner's crystalline
phase of the jellium model, can become very dilute. Our analysis explicitly
deals with this system. We show that the SLQCS energy per particle at large
dilution ($r_s$) behaves as $-M_{dl,\sigma}/r_s+C_{\sigma}/{r_s}^{3/2}$, where
$M_{dl,\sigma}$ turns out to be the Madelung constant of the considered cubic
symmetry $\sigma$ and $C_{\sigma}$ is a positive constant only numerically
determined. Moreover, as the density gets smaller and smaller, each electron
becomes more and more confined to the centre of its cell.

matrix element methods and likelihoods are used. No excess above the Standard

systems. We simulate one-dimensional two-component systems with predator-prey
local interaction and pursuit-evasion taxis between the components. In a
sufficiently large domain, spatially uniform oscillations in such systems are
unstable with respect to small perturbations. This instability, through a
transient regime appearing as spontanous focal sources, leads to establishment
of periodic traveling waves. The traveling waves regime is established even if
boundary conditions do not favor such solutions. The stable wavelength are
within a range bounded both from above and from below, and this range does not
coincide with instability bands of the spatially uniform oscillations.

dislocations by applying Noether's theorem. We present an improved
translational gauge theory of dislocations including the dislocation density
tensor and the dislocation current tensor. The invariance of the variational
principle under the continuous group of transformations is studied. Through
Lie's-infinitesimal invariance criterion we obtain conserved translational and
rotational currents for the total Lagrangian made up of an elastic and
dislocation part. We calculate the broken scaling current. Looking only on one
part of the whole system, the conservation laws are changed into balance laws.
Because of the lack of translational, rotational and dilatation invariance for
each part, a configurational force, moment and power appears. The corresponding
J, L and M integrals are obtained. Only isotropic and homogeneous materials are
considered and we restrict ourselves to a linear theory. We choose constitutive
laws for the most general linear form of material isotropy. Also we give the
conservation and balance laws corresponding to the gauge symmetry and the
addition of solutions. From the addition of solutions we derive a reciprocity
theorem for the gauge theory of dislocations. Also, we derive the conservation
laws for stress-free states of dislocations.

oscillations using the O(1 GeV) neutrino beam produced by the Booster
synchrotron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The Booster
delivers protons with 8 GeV kinetic energy (8.89 GeV/c momentum) to a beryllium
target, producing neutrinos from the decay of secondary particles in the beam
line. We describe the Monte Carlo simulation methods used to estimate the flux
of neutrinos from the beamline incident on the MiniBooNE detector for both
polarities of the focussing horn. The simulation uses the Geant4 framework for
propagating particles, accounting for electromagnetic processes and hadronic
interactions in the beamline materials, as well as the decay of particles. The
absolute double differential cross sections of pion and kaon production in the
simulation have been tuned to match external measurements, as have the hadronic
cross sections for nucleons and pions. The statistical precision of the flux
predictions is enhanced through reweighting and resampling techniques.
Systematic errors in the flux estimation have been determined by varying
parameters within their uncertainties, accounting for correlations where
appropriate.
