decaying top quarks) from light quark and gluon jets using jet substructure.
The procedure involves parsing the jet cluster to resolve its subjets, and then
imposing kinematic constraints. With this method, light quark or gluon jets
with pT ~ 1 TeV can be rejected with an efficiency of around 99% while
retaining up to 40% of top jets. This reduces the dijet background to heavy
t-tbar resonances by a factor of ~10,000, thereby allowing resonance searches
in t-tbar to be extended into the all-hadronic channel. In addition,
top-tagging can be used in t-tbar events when one of the tops decays
semi-leptonically, in events with missing energy, and in studies of b-tagging
efficiency at high pT.

the q-tetrahedron algebra $\boxtimes_q$. Let V denote a finite dimensional

tridiagonal pair on V. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ let $\theta_i$ (resp.
$\theta^*_i$) denote a standard ordering of the eigenvalues of A (resp. A^*).
Fix a nonzero scalar q which is not a root of unity. T. Ito and P. Terwilliger
have shown that when $\theta_i = q^{2i-d}$ and $\theta^*_i = q^{d-2i}$ there
exists an irreducible $\boxtimes_q$-module structure on V such that the
$\boxtimes_q$ generators x_{01}, x_{23} act as A, A^* respectively. In this
paper we examine the case in which there exists a nonzero scalar c in K such
that $\theta_i = q^{2i-d}$ and $\theta^*_i = q^{2i-d} + c q^{d-2i}$. In this
case we associate to A,A^* a polynomial P and prove the following equivalence.
The following are equivalent: (i) There exists a $\boxtimes_q$-module structure
on V such that x_{01} acts as A and x_{30} + cx_{23} acts as A^*, where x_{01},
x_{30}, x_{23} are standard generators for $\boxtimes_q$. (ii) P(q^{2d-2}

tagged molecule in a heterogeneous glass-forming liquid at temperatures just
above a glass transition. Among other features of this system, we postulated a
relation between heterogeneity and stretched-exponential decay of correlations,
and we also confirmed that systems of this kind generally exhibit non-Gaussian
diffusion on intermediate length and time scales. Here I extend this analysis
to higher temperatures approaching the point where the heterogeneities
disappear and thermal activation barriers become small. I start by modifying
the continuous-time random-walk theory proposed earlier, and supplement this
analysis with an extension of the excitation-chain theory of glass dynamics. I
also use a key result from the shear-transformation-zone theory of viscous
deformation of amorphous materials. Elements of each of these theories are then
used to interpret experimental data for ortho-terphenyl, specifially, the
diffusion and viscosity coefficients and neutron scattering measurements of the
self intermediate scattering function. Reconciling the theory with these data
sets provides insights about the crossover between super-Arrhenius and
Arrhenius dynamics, length scales of spatial heterogeneities, violation of the
Stokes-Einstein relation in glass-forming liquids, and the origin of stretched

present results for the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter,

(ungapped) quark phase. While the ungapped quark phase supports a temperature
window between 10^8 K and 5x10^9 K where the r-mode is damped even for rapid
rotation, the r-mode in a rapidly rotating pure CFL star is not damped in the
temperature range 10^10 K - 10^11 K. Rotating hybrid stars with quark matter
cores display an instability window whose width is determined by the amount of
quark matter present, and they can have large spin frequencies outside this
window. Except at high temperatures T > 10^10 K, the presence of a quark phase
allows for larger critical frequencies and smaller spin-periods compared to
rotating neutron stars. If low-mass X-ray binaries contain a large amount of
ungapped or CFL quark matter, then our estimates of the r-mode instability
suggest that there should be a population of rapidly rotating binaries at

equation which turns out to be a particular case of the generalized Langevin
equation introduced by Kubo on 1966. The importance of our approach is to model
the Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the
classical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding
effects due to hydrodynamic backflow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset memory
drag. On the basis of the two fluctuation-dissipation theorems and of the
techniques of the Fractional Calculus we have provided the analytical
expressions of the correlation functions (both for the random force and the
particle velocity) and of the mean squared particle displacement. The random
force has been shown to be represented by a superposition of the usual white
noise with a ""fractional"" noise. The velocity correlation function is no longer
expressed by a simple exponential but exhibits a slower decay, proportional to
$t^{-3/2}$ as $t \to \infty$, which indeed is more realistic. Finally, the mean
squared displacement has been shown to maintain, for sufficiently long times,
the linear behaviour which is typical of normal diffusion, with the same
diffusion coefficient of the classical case. However, the Basset history force
induces a retarding effect in the establishing of the linear behaviour, which
in some cases could appear as a manifestation of anomalous diffusion to be
correctly interpreted in experimental measurements.

Collider (RHIC) have identified a new form of matter formed in nuclei-nuclei
collisions at energy densities more than 100 times that of a cold atomic
nucleus. Measurements and comparison with relativistic hydrodynamic models
indicate that the matter thermalizes in an unexpectedly short time, has an
energy density at least 15 times larger than needed for color deconfinement,
has a temperature about twice the critical temperature predicted by lattice
QCD, and appears to exhibit collective motion with ideal hydrodynamic
properties - a ""perfect liquid"" that appears to flow with a near-zero viscosity
to entropy ratio - lower than any previously observed fluid and perhaps close
to a universal lower bound. However, a fundamental understanding of the medium
seen in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC does not yet exist. The most important
scientific challenge for the field in the next decade is the quantitative
exploration of the new state of nuclear matter. That will require new data that
will, in turn, require enhanced capabilities of the RHIC detectors and
accelerator. In this report we discuss the scientific opportunities for an
upgraded RHIC facility - RHIC II - in conjunction with improved capabilities of
the two large RHIC detectors, PHENIX and STAR. We focus solely on heavy flavor
probes. Their production rates are calculable using the well-established
techniques of perturbative QCD and their sizable interactions with the hot QCD
medium provide unique and sensitive measurements of its crucial properties
making them one of the key diagnostic tools available to us.

VLA survey produced by Condon et al. (2003), along with infrared data in up to
seven wavebands from the Spitzer Space Telescope, optical photometry from SDSS
and a range of spectroscopic redshift surveys, we are able to study the
relationship between radio luminosity and star formation rate in star-forming
galaxies up to z ~ 1. The large amount of multi-wavelength data available
allows accurate k-corrections to be performed in the radio due to the knowledge
of the radio spectral index, and in the infrared through the use of a
semi-empirical radiative transfer model which models star-forming regions, warm
dust surrounding these regions, and diffuse interstellar dust, taking into
account the star formation rate, star formation history and hydrogen column
density within each galaxy. A strong correlation is seen between radio
luminosity and infrared-derived star formation rates, which is best fit by a
slightly non-linear power-law. We look for cosmic evolution in the comparative
radio brightness of star-forming galaxies by searching for deviations away from
the global relationship. Any such deviation would indicate a systematic
variation in one or more of the properties controlling synchrotron radiation,
in particular an increase in the magnetic field strengths of star-forming
galaxies. The data shows no evidence for such an effect, suggesting that there
has been little evolution in the magnetic fields of galaxies since z ~ 1.

interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies
consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared
wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to
compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the
ambient ISM in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the
power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three
components: a component of PAHs; a mid-IR continuum characterising the emission
from hot grains; and a component of warm grains in thermal equilibrium with
adjustable temperature. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative
proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of
diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold
grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. Our model can be
used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust
contents of large samples of galaxies using UV, optical and IR observations. We
illustrate this by deriving median-likelihood estimates of the star formation
rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses, and relative
strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star- forming
galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). From this
analysis, we conclude that the mid- and far-IR colours of galaxies correlate
strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other
galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter. Our model can be
straightforwardly applied to interpret UV, optical and IR spectral energy
distributions from any galaxy sample. [abridged]

the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, Orion, to perform high-resolution
simulations of molecular cloud cores and protostars in environments with both
driven and decaying turbulence. We include self-gravity, use a barotropic
equation of state, and represent regions exceeding the maximum grid resolution

shape, linewidth, and rotational energy, and we find reasonable agreement with
observation. At high resolution, the different rates of core accretion in the
two cases have a significant effect on protostellar system development. Clumps
forming in a decaying turbulence environment produce high-multiplicity
protostellar systems with Toomre-Q unstable disks that exhibit characteristics
of the competitive accretion model for star formation. In contrast, cores
forming in the context of continuously driven turbulence and virial equilibrium
form smaller protostellar systems with fewer low-mass members. Our simulations
of driven and decaying turbulence show some statistically significant
differences, particularly in the production of brown dwarfs and core rotation,

the high redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) promises to be an excellent probe
of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). On large scales, the 21 cm and galaxy
fields are anti-correlated during most of the reionization epoch. However, on
scales smaller than the size of the H II regions around detectable galaxies,
the two fields become roughly uncorrelated. Consequently, the 21 cm-galaxy
cross power spectrum provides a tracer of bubble growth during reionization,
with the signal turning over on progressively larger scales as reionization
proceeds. The precise turnover scale depends on the minimum host mass of the
detectable galaxies, and the galaxy selection technique. Measuring the turnover
scale as a function of galaxy luminosity constrains the characteristic bubble
size around galaxies of different luminosities. The cross spectrum becomes
positive on small scales if ionizing photons fail to escape from low mass
galaxies, and these galaxies are detectable longward of the hydrogen ionization
edge, because in this case some identifiable galaxies lie outside of ionized
regions. LOFAR can potentially measure the 21 cm-galaxy cross spectrum in
conjunction with mild extensions to the existing Subaru survey for $z=6.6$
Lyman-alpha emitters, while the MWA is slightly less sensitive for detecting
the cross spectrum. A futuristic galaxy survey covering a sizable fraction of
the MWA field of view ($\sim 800$ deg$^2$) can probe the scale dependence of
the cross spectrum, constraining the filling factor of H II regions at
different redshifts during reionization, and providing other valuable
constraints on reionization models.

Lens Survey. The Sloan database is used to determine two measures of
overdensity of galaxies around each lens: the projected number density of
galaxies inside the tenth nearest neighbor (\Sigma_{10}) and within a cone of
radius one h^{-1} Mpc (D_1). Our main results are: 1) The average overdensity
is somewhat larger than unity, consistent with lenses preferring overdense
environments as expected for massive early-type galaxies (12/70 lenses are in
known groups/clusters). 2) The distribution of overdensities is
indistinguishable from that of ""twin"" non-lens galaxies selected from SDSS to
have the same redshift and stellar velocity dispersion \sigma_*. Thus, within
our errors, lens galaxies are an unbiased population, and the SLACS results can
be generalized to the overall population of early-type galaxies. 3) Typical
contributions from external mass distribution are no more than a few per cent,
reaching 10-20% (~0.05-0.10 external convergence) only in the most extreme
overdensities. 4) No significant correlation between overdensity and slope of
the mass density profile of the lens is found. 5) Satellite galaxies (those
with a more luminous companion) have marginally steeper mass density profiles
than central galaxies (those without). This result suggests that tidal
stripping may affect the mass structure of early-type galaxies down to kpc
scales probed by strong lensing, when they fall into larger structures

search, which uses multi-epoch 2MASS observations covering ~4700 square degrees
of sky. 2MASS J18212815+1414010 and 2MASS J21481628+4003593 were overlooked by
earlier surveys due to their faint optical magnitudes and their proximity to
the Galactic Plane (10 degrees < |b| < 15 degrees). Assuming that both dwarfs
are single, we derive spectrophotometric distances of ~10 pc, thus increasing
the number of known L dwarfs within 10 pc to 10. In the near-infrared, 2MASS
J21481628+4003593 shows a triangular-shaped H-band spectrum, strong CO
absorption, and a markedly red J-Ks color (2.38+/-0.06) for its L6 optical
spectral type. 2MASS J18212815+1414010 also shows a triangular-shaped H-band
spectrum and a slightly red J-Ks color (1.78+/-0.05) for its L4.5 optical
spectral type. Both objects show strong silicate absorption at 9-11 microns.
Cumulatively, these features imply an unusually dusty photosphere for both of
these objects. We examine several scenarios to explain the underlying cause for
their enhanced dust content and find that a metal-rich atmosphere or a
low-surface gravity are consistent with these results. 2MASS J18212815+1414010
may be young (and therefore have a low-surface gravity) based on its low
tangential velocity of 10 km/s. On the other hand, 2MASS J21481628+4003593 has
a high tangential velocity of 62 km/s and is therefore likely old. Hence, high
metallicity and low-surface gravity may lead to similar effects.

solid tumors, such as compact morphology with irregular borders, are captured.
The parameter space is studied in order to analyze the occurrence of necrosis
and the response to therapy. Our findings suggest that transitions exist
between necrotic and non-necrotic phases (no-therapy cases), and between the
states of cure and non-cure (therapy cases). To analyze cure, the control and
order parameters are, respectively, the highest probability of cancer cell
proliferation and the probability of the therapeutic effect on cancer cells.
With respect to patterns, it is possible to observe the inner necrotic core and
the effect of the therapy destroying the tumor from its outer borders inwards.

is to choose a set of histogram bucket boundaries or wavelet coefficients to
optimize the accuracy of the approximate representation of a collection of
probabilistic tuples under a given error metric. For a variety of different

(Pop III) stars by performing a series of two-dimensional rotational collapse
simulations of Pop III stellar cores. Our results show that rotation enhances
the neutrino luminosities and the average energies of emitted neutrinos. This
is because the thermalized inner core, which is the dominant neutrino source
from Pop III stars, can be enlarged, due to rotational flattening, enough to
extend the inner core outside the neutrinospheres. This is in sharp contrast to
the case of spherical collapse, in which the case of inner core shrinks deeper
inside the neutrinospheres before black hole formation, which hinders the
efficient neutrino emission. In the case of rotational core-collapse, the
emitted neutrino energies are found to become larger in the vicinity near the
pole than the ones near the equatorial plane. These factors make the emergent
neutrino spectrum broader and harder than the spherical collapse case. By
computing the overall neutrino signals produced by the ensemble of individual
rotating Pop III stars, we find that the amplitudes of the relic neutrinos,
depending on their star formation rates, can dominate over the contributions
from ordinary core-collapse supernovae below a few MeV. A detection of this
signal could be an important tool to probe star formation history in the early

does not enter. Such masses can be generated in several ways: they can arise as
a consequence of flux about internal spatial dimensions, they may arise as
thermal fermion masses in a quasi-static phase in the early universe, and they
will arise after the breaking of supersymmetry at late times. The vacuum
contribution to the potential for the Dilaton is evaluated up to two loops. The
result shows a minimum which could stabilize the Dilaton for reasonable ranges
of parameter values.

analog-to-digital conversion; in contrast to classical binary quantization, in
which each analog sample x in [-1,1] is mapped to the first N bits of its
base-2 expansion, beta-encoders replace each sample x with its expansion in a
base beta satisfying 1 < beta < 2. This expansion is non-unique when 1 < beta <
2, and the beta-encoder exploits this redundancy to correct inevitable errors
made by the quantizer component of its circuit design.
  The multiplier element of the beta-encoder will also be imprecise;
effectively, the true value beta at any time can only be specified to within an
interval [ beta_{low}, beta_{high} ]. This problem was addressed by the golden
ratio encoder, a close relative of the beta-encoder that does not require a
precise multiplier. However, the golden ratio encoder is susceptible to
integrator leak in the delay elements of its hardware design, and this has the
same effect of changing beta to an unknown value.
  In this paper, we present a method whereby exponentially precise
approximations to the value of beta in both golden ratio encoders and beta
encoders can be recovered amidst imprecise circuit components from the
truncated beta-expansions of a ""test"" number x_{test} in [-1,1], and its
negative counterpart, -x_{test}. That is, beta-encoders and golden ratio
encoders are robust with respect to unavoidable analog component imperfections
that change the base beta needed for reconstruction.

~10$^11$ M_o systems (elliptical galaxies). The lack of measured velocity
dispersions for dwarf ellipticals with -16 > M_K > -18 (~10$^8$ M_o) currently
inhibits our ability to determine how, or indeed if, these galaxies connect
continuously with GCs in terms of their virial-to-stellar mass ratios. We find
elliptical galaxies to have roughly equal fractions of dark and stellar matter
within a virial radius; only in the most massive (greater than 10$^11$ M_o)
ellipticals does dark matter dominate the virial mass. Although the IMOs reveal
slightly higher virial-to-stellar mass ratios than lower mass GCs, this may
simply reflect our limited understanding of their IMF (and hence their stellar
mass-to-light ratios) or structural properties. We argue that most of these
intermediate mass objects are a natural extension of the GC sequence to higher
masses, i.e. IMOs are essentially massive star clusters. [Abridged].

agents is modeled as a time non-homogeneous Markov chain. Such a model is
appropriate for mobile networks, as the network topology changes across time in

distribution of the obstructing cloud, the numerical experiments show that the
deflection angle is mainly determined by the impact parameter and the density
contrast between the outflow and the cloud. The deflection angle is, however,
relatively insensitive to the velocity of the outflow. Using a numerical model
with physical conditions that are particularly suitable for the IRAS 4A system,
we produce a column-density image and a position-velocity diagram along the
outflow, and they are consistent with the observations. Based on our numerical
simulations, if we assume that the initial density and the velocity of the
outflow are $\sim 10 \cm3$ and $\sim 100 \kms$, the densities of the dense core
and ambient medium in the IRAS 4A system are most likely to be $\sim 10^5 \cm3$

simulations that the directional variability of the IRAS 4A outflow can be

(dis-)similarity measure between two genomes, e.g. in order to construct a
phylogeny. All the existing measures are defined on genomes without duplicates.
However, we know that genes can be duplicated within the same genome. One
possible approach to overcome this difficulty is to establish a one-to-one
correspondence (i.e. a matching) between genes of both genomes, where the
correspondence is chosen in order to optimize the studied measure. In this
paper, we are interested in three measures (number of breakpoints, number of
common intervals and number of conserved intervals) and three models of
matching (exemplar, intermediate and maximum matching models). We prove that,
for each model and each measure M, computing a matching between two genomes
that optimizes M is APX-hard. We also study the complexity of the following
problem: is there an exemplarization (resp. an intermediate/maximum matching)
that induces no breakpoint? We prove the problem to be NP-Complete in the
exemplar model for a new class of instances, and we show that the problem is in
P in the maximum matching model. We also focus on a fourth measure: the number
of adjacencies, for which we give several approximation algorithms in the
maximum matching model, in the case where genomes contain the same number of
duplications of each gene.

First, we elaborate the Banks-Casher relations in the complex plane extended

condensates and clarify the characteristic spectral change corresponding to the

the Aoki (parity-flavor broken) phase and conclude from the point of view of
the spectral density that the artificial pion condensation is not induced by
the density effect in strong-coupling two-color QCD.

an increase of dissipated energy with increasing temperature. While the

bosons with gauge kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon, predicted by many
extensions of the Standard Model. The setup consists of a highly sensitive
magnetometer inside a superconducting shielding. This is then placed inside a
strong (but sub-critical) magnetic field. In ordinary electrodynamics the
magnetic field cannot permeate the superconductor and no field should register
on the magnetometer. However, photon -- hidden-sector photon -- photon
oscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field
would ""leak"" into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer.
Although this setup resembles a classic ``light shining though a wall
experiment'' there are two crucial differences. First, the fields are (nearly)
static and the photons involved are virtual. Second, the magnetometer directly
measures the field-strength and not a probability. This improves the dependence
of the signal on the kinetic mixing chi (\ll 1) to chi^2 instead of chi^4. For
hidden photon masses in the range 0.002-200 meV the projected sensitivity for
the mixing parameter lies in the 5 10^-9 to 10^-6 range. This surpasses current
astrophysical and laboratory limits by several orders of magnitude -- ample

of equal spheres, at different volume filling factor. The spatial correlation
given by the constraint that particles cannot superimpose produces a
diffraction peak with a low $S(q)$ in its low-$q$ tail, which is relevant for
light scattering. The physical mechanism producing high transparency in
glass-ceramics is demonstrated to be the low density fluctuation in the number
of scatterers.

determine the system parameters via a parametrized model of the eclipse fitted

systems possess brown dwarf donor stars and are believed to have evolved past
the orbital period minimum. This is in line with predictions that 40-70 per
cent of CVs should have evolved past the orbital period minimum. Therefore, the
main result of our study is that the missing population of post-period minimum
CVs has finally been identified. The donor star masses and radii are, however,
inconsistent with model predictions; the donor stars are approximately 10 per
cent larger than expected across the mass range studied here. One explanation
for the discrepancy is enhanced angular momentum loss (e.g. from circumbinary
discs), however the mass-transfer rates, as deduced from white dwarf effective
temperatures, are not consistent with enhanced angular momentum loss. We show
it is possible to explain the large donor radii without invoking enhanced
angular momentum loss by a combination of geometrical deformation and the
effects of starspots due to strong rotation and expected magnetic activity.
Choosing unambiguously between these different solutions will require
independent estimates of the mass-transfer rates in short period CVs.

the nanotube length is varied between 0.1 and 0.8 $\mu$m. The spatial
distributions of channeled protons are generated using a computer simulation
method, which includes the numerical solving of the proton equations of motion
in the transverse plane. We show that the dynamic polarization effect can
strongly affect the rainbow maxima in the spatial distributions, so as to
increase the proton flux at the distances from the nanotube wall of the order
of a few tenths of a nanometer at the expense of the flux at the nanotube
center. While our findings are connected to the possible applications of
nanosized ion beams created with the nanotubes embedded in various dielectric
media for biomedical research and in materials modification, they also open the
prospects of applying ion channeling for detecting and locating the atoms and
molecules intercalated inside the nanotubes.

It also features several remarkable properties such as being jointly concave

supermultiplicative and does not behave monotonically under quantum operations.

for unambiguous state discrimination enable one to completely eliminate
spin-flip errors in the resulting qubit states, as they would occur in a
homodyne-based scheme due to the finite overlap of the optical states in phase

innovation there was the introduction of ""ghost elements,"" which also play the
key role in our structure theory. Here, we work somewhat more generally over an
ordered monoid, and develop a theory which contains the analogs of several
basic theorems of classical commutative algebra. This structure enables one to
develop a Zariski-type algebraic geometric approach to tropical geometry,
viewing tropical varieties as sets of roots of (supertropical) polynomials,
leading to an analog of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz. Particular attention is
paid to factorization of polynomials. In one indeterminate, any polynomial can
be factored into linear and quadratic factors, and unique factorization holds
in a certain sense. On the other hand, the failure of unique factorization in
several indeterminates is explained by geometric phenomena described in the
paper.

light curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060526 at $z=3.221$.
Methods: We present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for a
GRB afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultraviolet
to the near infrared. The data set contains 412 data points in total to which
we add additional data from the literature. Furthermore, we present
low-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. The afterglow
light curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power law
fits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.
The absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive column
densities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis from
which we derive the metallicity of the host of GRB 060526. Results: The
temporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law with
breaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. It shows deviations
from the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energy
injections from the central engine, although some significant microvariability
remains. The broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows no
significant extinction along the line of sight. The metallicity derived from
\ion{S}{II} and \ion{Fe}{II} of [S/H] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [Fe/H] =
--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparable
to the metallicity of other GRB hosts at similar redshifts. At the position of
the afterglow, no host is detected to F775W(AB) = 28.5 mag with the HST,
implying an absolute magnitude of the host M(1500 \AA{})$>$--18.3 mag which is
fainter than most long-duration hosts, although the GRB may be associated with
a faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

affect the fits to the strongest degree.

12000 stars in 46 fields with lines of sight toward the Pipe nebula to
investigate the properties of the polarization across this dark cloud complex.
Mean polarization vectors show that the magnetic field is locally perpendicular
to the large filamentary structure of the Pipe nebula (the `stem'), indicating
that the global collapse may have been driven by ambipolar diffusion. The
polarization properties clearly change along the Pipe nebula. The northwestern
end of the nebula (B59 region) is found to have a low degree of polarization
and high dispersion in polarization position angle, while at the other extreme
of the cloud (the `bowl') we found mean degrees of polarization as high as
$\approx$15% and a low dispersion in polarization position angle. The plane of
the sky magnetic field strength was estimated to vary from about 17 $\mu$G in
the B59 region to about 65 $\mu$G in the bowl. We propose that three distinct
regions exist, which may be related to different evolutionary states of the
cloud; this idea is supported by both the polarization properties across the
Pipe and the estimated mass-to-flux ratio that varies between approximately
super-critical toward the B59 region and sub-critical inside the bowl. The
three regions that we identify are: the B59 region, which is currently forming
stars; the stem, which appears to be at an earlier stage of star formation
where material has been through a collapsing phase but not yet given birth to
stars; and the bowl, which represents the earliest stage of the cloud in which
the collapsing phase and cloud fragmentation has already started.

technicolor model (WTC) can provide a composite dark matter candidate, by
forming bound states between a -2 electrically charged techniparticle and a
$^4He^{++}$. We studied the properties of these \emph{techni-O-helium} $tOHe$
""atoms"", which behave as warmer dark matter rather than cold. In this paper we
extend our work on several different aspects. We study the possibility of a
mixed scenario where both $tOHe$ and bound states between +2 and -2
electrically charged techniparticles coexist in the dark matter density. We
argue that these newly proposed bound states solely made of techniparticles,
although they behave as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), due to
their large elastic cross section with nuclei, can only account for a small
percentage of the dark matter density. Therefore we conclude that within the
minimal WTC, composite dark matter should be mostly composed of $tOHe$.
Moreover in this paper, we put cosmological bounds in the masses of the
techniparticles, if they compose the dark matter density. Finally we propose
within this setup, a possible explanation of the discrepancy between the
DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA findings and the negative results of CDMS and other
direct dark matter searches that imply nuclear recoil measurement, which should
accompany ionization.

Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory, and is applied to liquid sodium at all
wavevectors q from the hydrodynamic regime to the free particle limit. In this
theory the zeroth-order Hamiltonian describes the vibrational motion in a
single random valley harmonically extended to infinity. This Hamiltonian is
tractable, is evaluated a priori for monatomic liquids, and the same
Hamiltonian (the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) is used for
equilibrium and nonequlibrium theory. Here, for the self intermediate
scattering function Fself(q,t) we find the vibrational contribution is in near
perfect agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) through short and intermediate
times, at all q. This is direct confirmation that normal mode vibrational
correlations are present in the motion of the liquid state. The primary transit
effect is diffusive motion of the vibrational equilibrium positions, as the
liquid transits rapidly among random valleys. This motion is modeled as a
standard random walk, and the resulting theoretical Fself(q,t) is in excellent
agreement with MD results at all q and t. In the limit for q to infinity, the
theory automatically exhibits the correct approach to the free-particle limit.
Also in the limit for q to zero, the hydrodynamic limit emerges as well. In
contrast to the benchmark theories of generalized hydrodynamics and mode
coupling, the present theory is near a priori, while achieving modestly better
accuracy. Therefore, in our view, it constitutes an improvement over the
traditional theories.

traversable by humanoid travelers are subject to severe constraints from
quantum field theory, particularly the so-called quantum inequalities, here
slightly extended. Moreover, self-collapse of such wormholes can only be
prevented by the use of ""exotic matter,"" which, being rather problematical,
should be used in only minimal quantities. However, making the layer of exotic
matter arbitrarily thin leads to other problems, such as the need for extreme
fine-tuning. This paper discusses a class of wormhole geometries that strike a
balance between reducing the proper distance across the exotic region and the
degree of fine-tuning required to achieve this reduction. Surprisingly, the
degree of fine-tuning appears to be a generic feature of the type of wormhole
discussed. No particular restriction is placed on the throat size, even though
the proper thickness of the exotic region can indeed be quite small. Various
traversability criteria are shown to be met.

critical to better understand the evolutionary sequence which leads to the
formation of high-mass stars. IRAS 18151-1208 is a nearby massive region (d =
3kpc, L ~ 20000 Lsun) which splits into three cores: MM1, MM2 and MM3
(separated by 1'-2'). We aim at (1) studying the physical and chemical
properties of the individual MM1, MM2 and MM3 cores; (2) deriving their
evolutionary stages; (3) using these results to improve our view of the
evolutionary sequence of massive cores. The region was observed in the CS,
C34S, H2CO, HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ lines at mm wavelengths with the IRAM 30m
and Mopra telescopes. We use 1D and 2D modeling of the dust continuum to derive
the density and temperature distributions, which are then used in the RATRAN
code to model the lines and constrain the abundances of the observed species.
All the lines were detected in MM1 and MM2. MM3 shows weaker emission, or even
is undetected in HCO+ and all isotopic species. MM2 is driving a newly
discovered CO outflow and hosts a mid-IR-quiet massive protostar. The abundance
of CS is significantly larger in MM1 than in MM2, but smaller than in a
reference massive protostar such as AFGL2591. In contrast the N2H+ abundance
decreases from MM2 to MM1, and is larger than in AFGL2591. Both MM1 and MM2
host an early phase massive protostar, but MM2 (and mid-IR-quiet sources in
general) is younger and more dominated by the host protostar than MM1
(mid-IR-bright). The MM3 core is probably in a pre-stellar phase. We find that
the N2H+/C34S ratio varies systematically with age in the massive protostars
for which the data are available. It can be used to identify young massive
protostars.
