provide us with a unique window into the physics of early universe. We show
that the impact of a small local primordial non-gaussianity (generated on
super-horizon scales) on the statistics of collapsed objects (such as galaxies
or clusters) can be approximated by using slightly modified, but gaussian,
initial conditions, which we describe through simple analytic expressions.
Given that numerical simulations with gaussian initial conditions are
relatively well-studied, this equivalence provides us with a simple tool to
predict signatures of primordial non-gaussianity in the statistics of collapsed
objects. In particular, we describe the predictions for non-gaussian mass
function, and also confirm the recent discovery of a non-local bias on large
scales (arXiv:0710.4560, arXiv:0801.4826) as a signature of primordial
non-gaussianity. We then study the potential of galaxy surveys to constrain
non-gaussianity using their auto-correlation and cross-correlation with the CMB
(due to the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect), as a function of survey
characteristics, and predict that they will eventually yield an accuracy of
Delta f_{NL} ~ 0.1 and 3 respectively, which will be better than or competitive
with (but independent of) the best predicted constraints from the CMB.
Interestingly, the cross-correlation of CMB and NVSS galaxy survey already
shows a hint of a large local primordial non-gaussianity: f_{NL} = 236 +/- 127.

N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be computed by diagonalizing a long
range integrable Hamiltonian by means of perturbative asymptotic Bethe ansatz.
This formalism breaks down when the number of fields of the composite operator
is smaller than the range of the Hamiltonian which coincides with the order in
perturbation theory at study. We analyze two spin chain toy models which might
shed some light on the physics behind these wrapping effects. One of them, the
Hubbard model, is known to be closely related to N=4 SYM. In this example, we
find that the knowledge of the effective spin chain description is insufficient
to reconstruct the finite size effects of the underlying electron theory. We
compute the wrapping corrections for generic states and relate them to a
Luscher like approach. The second toy models are long range integrable
Hamiltonians built from the standard algebraic Bethe anstatz formalism. This
construction is valid for any symmetry group. In particular, for non-compact
groups it exhibits an interesting relation between wrapping interactions and
transcendentality.

Phi=phi+fNL (phi-<phi^2>)+gNL phi^3+..., where Phi is proportional to the
initial potential fluctuations and phi is a Gaussian field, using
beyond-linear-order perturbation theory. I find that the need to eliminate
large higher-order corrections necessitates the addition of a new term to the
bias model, proportional to phi, i.e., delta_g=b_delta delta+b_phi fNL phi+...,
with all the consequences this implies for clustering statistics, e.g.,
P_gg(k)=b_delta^2 P_deltadelta(k)+2 b_delta b_phi fNL P_phidelta(k)+b_phi^2
fNL^2 P_phiphi(k)+... . This result is consistent with calculations based on a
model for dark matter halo clustering, showing that the form is quite general,
not requiring assumptions about peaks, or the formation or existence of halos.
The halo model plays the same role it does in the usual bias picture, giving a
prediction for b_phi for galaxies known to sit in a certain type of halo.
Previous projections for future constraints based on this effect have been very
conservative -- there is enough volume at z<~2 to measure fNL to ~+-1, with
much more volume at higher z. As a prelude to the bias calculation, I point out
that the beyond-linear (in phi) corrections to the power spectrum of
mass-density perturbations are naively infinite, so it is dangerous to assume
they are negligible; however, the infinite part can be removed by a
renormalization of the fluctuation amplitude, with the residual k-dependent
corrections negligible for models allowed by current constraints.

weighted number of possible matchings among particles in two consecutive
snapshots, the partition function of the underlying graphical model. The
partition function is then maximized over the model parameters, namely
diffusivity and velocity gradient. A Belief Propagation (BP) scheme is the
backbone of our algorithm, providing accurate results for the flow parameters

Loop Series (LS) contributions. For the weighted matching problem, LS is
compactly expressed as a Cauchy integral, accurately estimated by a saddle
point approximation. Numerical experiments show that the quality of our
improved BP algorithm is comparable to the one of a fully polynomial randomized
approximation scheme, based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method,

Density evolution equations for simple faulty iterative decoders are derived.
In one model, computing nonlinear estimation thresholds shows that performance

paired-quark clusters (PQ)(pi, s, b, c), and four alpha^4 pairing gaps between
the fast PQ decays (which conserve flavor) and the slow UQ decays (which do

Variational
trial functions for the Meissner state are combined with variational functions
for a vortex near the surface. The latter is based on Clem's trial solutions
for a vortex in bulk, which were adapted to include surface effects through
consideration of an image vortex. Three variational parameters are considered,
corresponding to the effective coherence length of the vortex, the effective
penetration length for the Meissner currents, and the value of the order
parameter at the surface. The results show that the last two variational
parameters are independent of vortex position. Explicit calculations are
presented for several $\kappa$ values. The energy barrier for vortex
penetration is shown to be in good agreement with full numerical calculations
of the Ginzburg--Landau equations. We consider the variation of the magnetic
flux carried by a vortex as it gets inside the superconductor and agreement
with known experimental and theoretical results is obtained. The model was
extended to calculate the force between two vortices, and the results show that
the force goes to zero as the pair comes close to the surface. This result can
be of interest for the study of the melting of the vortex lattice and for
vortices confined in mesoscopic superconductors. The variational approach can
be very helpful for intermediate $\kappa$ values when numerical calculations
become computationally demanding because it provides manageable expressions for
all physically relevant quantities.

Using brane constructions we argue that the U(N)xU(N) theory at level k
describes the low energy limit of N M2-branes probing a C^4/Z_k singularity. At
large N the theory is then dual to M theory on AdS_4xS^7/Z_k. The theory also
has a 't Hooft limit (of large N with a fixed ratio N/k) which is dual to type
IIA string theory on AdS_4xCP^3. For k=1 the theory is conjectured to describe
N M2-branes in flat space, although our construction realizes explicitly only
six of the eight supersymmetries. We give some evidence for this conjecture,
which is similar to the evidence for mirror symmetry in d=3 gauge theories.
When the gauge group is SU(2)xSU(2) our theory has extra symmetries and becomes
identical to the Bagger-Lambert theory.

and reward. Quantitative studies of professional careers are traditionally

radiation starting right after the central engine shuts off. The latter
scenario consists of the emission from an ""ember"" that cools via adiabatic
expansion and, if the jet angle is larger than the inverse of the source
Lorentz factor, the large angle emission. In this work, we calculate the
temporal and spectral properties of the emission from such a cooling ember,
providing a new treatment for the micro-physics of the adiabatic expansion. We
use the adiabatic invariance of p_{\perp}^2/B (p_{\perp} is the component of
the electrons' momentum normal to the magnetic field, B) to calculate the
electrons' Lorentz factor during the adiabatic expansion; the electron momentum
becomes more and more aligned with the local magnetic field as the expansion
develops. We compare the theoretical expectations of the adiabatic expansion
(and the large angle emission) with the current observations of the early x-ray
data and find that only about 20% of our sample of 107 bursts is potentially
consistent with this model. This leads us to believe that, for most bursts, the
central engine does not turn off completely during the steep decay of the x-ray
light curve; therefore, this phase is produced by the continued rapidly
declining activity of the central engine.

that the observed variations cannot be originated by the presence of a

improve both the secrecy of the key generated by the PRG and the secrecy of the

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/590902",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that using either the method of Page & Carrera or the well-known
$1/V_a$ method to construct the binned luminosity function (LF) of a flux
limited sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can produce an artificial
flattening (or steepening in the case of negative evolution) of the binned LF
for bins intersected by the flux cutoff of the sample. This effect is more
pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still
present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true
LF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of
the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power law
functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the binned
LF. We show that these spurious breaks in the binned LFs can be avoided if the
binning is done in the flux--redshift plane instead of the typically used
luminosity--redshift plane. Binning in the flux--redshift plane can be used in
conjunction with the binning in the luminosity--redshift plane to test for real
breaks in the binned LFs and to identify the features that are the result of
binning biases. We illustrate this effect for most typical forms of luminosity
dependence and redshift evolution and show how the proposed method helps
address this problem. We also apply this method to the MOJAVE AGN sample and
show that it eliminates an apparent break in the binned LF.

focus specifically on the role of anharmonic effects that are expected to be
non-negligible due to the significant zero-point motion. For this purpose, we
compute the formation free energies using both the harmonic approximation (HA)

cylindrical layer of fluid with meridional convective circulation was studied
experimentally. Two cases were considered: direct circulation provided by a rim
heater at the periphery and indirect circulation provided by a central heater.
The detailed 3D structure of the mean large-scale velocity field is
reconstructed using the PIV technique. Due to the action of the Coriolis force
the meridional flow results in differential rotation. Differential rotation is
characterized by the mean values of radial and vertical gradients of azimuthal
velocity. Strong negative mean radial gradient which grows with the Grasshoff
number is provided by direct circulation. In the case of indirect circulation a
pronounced negative gradient arises at moderate Grashoff number. The behavior
of the mean vertical gradient is quite different: a positive vertical gradient
grows logarithmically with Grasshoff number under direct circulation, whereas a
weak negative gradient characterizes the indirect circulation. This difference
follows from the structure of the flow -- the direct circulation provides a
large cyclonic area localized above the anticyclonic flow, while indirect
circulation leads to a strong separation of these two areas in the radial
direction (the central part is occupied by the cyclonic flow and the periphery
by the anticyclonic flow). Meridional circulation leads to substantial
variation of the integral angular momentum. Direct circulation results in the
growth of the integral angular momentum and indirect circulation causes it to
decrease. At the same heating power, the increase of angular momentum at direct
circulation is much stronger than its decrease at indirect circulation.

show that this detection is inconsistent with the inverse-Compton model
proposed in the literature, and instead implies a synchrotron origin of the
X-ray jet photons. We also find that the width of the X-ray counterjet is
possibly narrower than that measured in radio bands, that the radio-to-X-ray

are substantial (kpc-scale) offsets between the positions of the X-ray and

without the surface roughness has a non-monotonic and oscillatory dependence on
$R$, the size of the particles, with the amplitude of the fluctuations varying
linearly with $R$. The geometry of the particle also matters a lot in the
calculation of the net magnetic moment. An oblate spheroid shape particle shows
an increase in net magnetic moment by increasing oblateness of the particle.
However, the magnetic moment values thus calculated are very small compared to
the experimental values for various sizes, indicating that the bulk
antiferromagnetic structure may not hold near the surface. We incorporate the
surface roughness in two different ways; an ordered surface with surface spins
inside a surface roughness shell aligned due to an internal field, and a
disordered surface with randomly oriented spins inside surface roughness shell.
Taking a variational approach we find that the core interaction strength is
modified for nontrivial values of $\Delta$ which is a signature of
multi-sublattice ordering for nanoparticles. The surface roughness scale
$\Delta $ is also showing size dependent fluctuations, with an envelope decay
$\Delta\sim R^{-1/5}$. The net magnetic moment values calculated using
spheroidal shape and ordered surface are close to the experimental values for
different sizes.

principle of the biofeedback consisted of providing supplementary information
related to foot sole pressure distribution through a wireless embedded

Results showed that (1) the Extended head posture yielded increased CoP
displacements relative to the Neutral head posture in the No-biofeedback

ligand-dependent transcription factors that share two conserved domains: the
DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). In order to gain
further insight into the evolution of metamorphosis and gene regulation by
ecdysone in arthropods, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of both partners
of the heterodimer ECR/USP-RXR. Overall, 38 USP-RXR and 19 ECR protein
sequences, from 33 species, have been used for this analysis. Interestingly,
sequence alignments and structural comparisons reveal high divergence rates,
for both ECR and USP-RXR, specifically among Diptera and Lepidoptera. The most
impressive differences affect the ligand-binding domain of USP-RXR. In
addition, ECR sequences show variability in other domains, namely the
DNA-binding and the carboxy-terminal F domains. Our data provide the first
evidence that ECR and USP-RXR may have coevolved during holometabolous insect
diversification, leading to a functional divergence of the ecdysone receptor.

cross-correlation function (CCF). The derived $t_{peak}$ and $t_{cen}$ are a
power-law function of energy. The lag calculated by CCF is strongly correlated
with that derived from $t_{peak}$. But the lag derived from $t_{cen}$ is less
correlated with that derived from $t_{peak}$ and CCF. The energy dependence of
the lags is shallower at higher energy bands. These characteristics are well
consistent with that observed in typical long-lag, wide-pulse GRBs, suggesting
that GRBs 980425 and 060218 may share the similar radiation physics with them.

observed simultaneously by the three \emph{Swift} instruments. Its main peak
also triggered Konus-Wind and HETE-II. Therefore, investigation on both the
temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission can be extended to
X-ray bands. We perform a detailed analysis on the two well identified pulses
of this burst, and find that the pulses are narrower at higher energies, and
both X-rays and gamma-rays follow the same $w - E$ relation for an individual
pulse. However, there is no a universal power-law index of the $w - E$ relation
among pulses. We find also that the rise-to-decay ratio $r/d$ seems not to
evolve with $E$ and the $r/d$ values are well consistent with that observed in
typical GRBs. The broadband spectral energy distribution also suggest that the
X-rays are consistent with the spectral behavior of the gamma-rays. These
results indicates that the X-ray emission tracks the gamma-ray emission and the
emissions in the two energy bands are likely to be originated from the same
physical mechanism.

HOL and PVS. Church's logic has a simple set-theoretic semantics, making it
trustworthy and extensible. We factor HOL into a constructive core plus axioms
of excluded middle and choice. We similarly factor standard set theory, ZFC,
into a constructive core, IZF, and axioms of excluded middle and choice. Then
we provide the standard set-theoretic semantics in such a way that the
constructive core of HOL is mapped into IZF. We use the disjunction, numerical
existence and term existence properties of IZF to provide a program extraction
capability from proofs in the constructive core.
  We can implement the disjunction and numerical existence properties in two
different ways: one using Rathjen's realizability for IZF and the other using a
new direct weak normalization result for IZF by Moczydlowski. The latter can
also be used for the term existence property.

disorder at paramagnetic temperatures are investigated in single-site coherent
potential approximation. It is shown that the nonmagnetic impurity shifts the
band of carriers and suppresses the van Hove singularities of the local density
of states (LDOS) depending on the value of impurity concentration. The magnetic
impurity, however, broadens the band which depends on the strength of exchange
coupling, and in the high impurity concentration, the van Hove singularities in
the LDOS can completely disappear and the curves become smooth.

doped spin-Peierls compound Ti(1-x)Sc(x)OCl (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03). These
measurements reveal that the presence of non-magnetic dopants has a profound
effect on the unconventional spin-Peierls behavior of this system, even at
concentrations as low as 1%. Sc-doping suppresses commensurate fluctuations in
the pseudogap and incommensurate spin-Peierls phases of TiOCl, and prevents the
formation of a long-range ordered spin-Peierls state. Broad incommensurate
scattering develops in the doped compounds near Tc2 ~ 93 K, and persists down
to base temperature (~ 7 K) with no evidence of a lock-in transition. The width
of the incommensurate dimerization peaks indicates short correlation lengths on
the order of ~ 12 angstroms below Tc2. The intensity of the incommensurate
scattering is significantly reduced at higher Sc concentrations, indicating
that the size of the associated lattice displacement decreases rapidly as a
function of doping.
