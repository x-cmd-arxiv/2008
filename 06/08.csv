increased the need for testing modifications to GR, as the inference of such

this work I outline a general scheme for constructing consistent and covariant

for the calibrator stars, 44 detached binaries were selected from the Hipparcos

corrected absolute magnitude for optical and near-infrared pass bands are valid
for wide ranges of colours and absolute magnitudes: $-0.18<(B-V)_{0}<0.91$,
$-1.6<M_{V}<5.5$ and $-0.15<(J-H)_{0}<0.50$, $-0.02<(H-K_{s})_{0}<0.13$,

one can associate some abelian algebras that we call directed abelian algebras

algebras depend on several parameters and are semisimple. Using any DAA one can
define a family of Hamiltonians which give the continuous time evolution of a
stochastic process. The calculation of the spectra and ground state
wavefunctions (stationary states probability distributions) is an easy
algebraic exercise. If one considers D-dimensional lattices and choose
Hamiltonians linear in the generators, in the finite-size scaling the
Hamiltonian spectrum is gapless with a critical dynamic exponent $z = D$. One
possible application of the DAA is to sandpile models. In the paper we present
this application considering one and two dimensional lattices. In the one
dimensional case, when the DAA conserves the number of particles, the
avalanches belong to the random walker universality class (critical exponent

broad line radio galaxies and 57 narrow line radio galaxies, allowing
unification to be considered in terms of source morphological properties. Radio
maps of all the targets have been presented in earlier papers. Here we carry
out a systematic analysis of the properties of the jets, cores, lobes and
hotspots of objects in the sample. The majority of the tests that we perform
show that the data are consistent with a model in which quasars and broad-line
radio galaxies are unified with narrow-line objects. Relativistic beaming is
the main effect that determines the properties of kiloparsec-scale jets, and it
may also have some effect on hotspots. However, some properties of the sample
are difficult to account for in simple unified models.

thin film form with the aim of understanding the experimentally observed metal
to insulator transition at reduced thickness. Although the spatial extent of
the 4$d$ orbitals is quite large, many experimental results have suggested that
electron-electron correlations play an important role in determining this
material's electronic structure. In order to investigate the importance of
correlation, we use two approaches which go beyond the conventional local
density approximation to density functional theory (DFT): the local spin
density approximation + Hubbard $U$ (LSDA+$U$) and the pseudopotential
self-interaction correction (pseudo-SIC) methods. We find that the details of
the electronic structure predicted with the LSDA do not agree with the
experimental spectroscopic data for bulk and thin film SrRuO$_3$. Improvement
is found by including electron-electron correlations, and we suggest that bulk
orthorhombic SrRuO$_3$ is a {\it weakly strongly-correlated} ferromagnet whose
electronic structure is best described by a 0.6 eV on-site Hubbard term, or
equivalently with corrections for the self-interaction error. We also perform
{\it ab initio} transport calculations that confirm that SrRuO$_3$ has a
negative spin polarization at the Fermi level, due to the position of the
minority Ru 4$d$ band center. Even with correlations included in our
calculations we are unable to reproduce the experimentally observed
metal-insulator transition, suggesting that the electronic behavior of
SrRuO$_3$ ultra-thin films might be dominated by extrinsic factors such as
surface disorder and defects.

propositions/hypotheses in the light of new evidence lies at the heart of
Bayesian inference. The basic natural assumption, as summarized in van
Fraassen's Reflection Principle ([1984]), would be that in the absence of new
evidence the belief should not change. Yet, there are examples that are claimed
to violate this assumption. The apparent paradox presented by such examples, if
not settled, would demonstrate the inconsistency and/or incompleteness of the
Bayesian approach and without eliminating this inconsistency, the approach
cannot be regarded as scientific.
  The Sleeping Beauty Problem is just such an example. The existing attempts to
solve the problem fall into three categories. The first two share the view that
new evidence is absent, but differ about the conclusion of whether Sleeping
Beauty should change her belief or not, and why. The third category is
characterized by the view that, after all, new evidence (although hidden from
the initial view) is involved.
  My solution is radically different and does not fall in either of these
categories. I deflate the paradox by arguing that the two different degrees of
belief presented in the Sleeping Beauty Problem are in fact beliefs in two
different propositions, i.e. there is no need to explain the (un)change of
belief.

within the collective pinning model. A crossover field, Bsb, from the single
vortex to the small vortex bundle pinning regime was observed. The temperature
dependence of Bsb(T) is in good agreement with the delta-l pinning mechanism,
i.e., pinning associated with fluctuations in the charge-carrier mean free

activated flux flow is found to be responsible for the resistivity contribution
in the vicinity of Tc. The activation energy U0/kB is 2000 K in low fields and
scales as B (-1/3) over a wide field range. Our results indicate that the

hidden by the difficulties to disentangle magnetic flux through the resolution
element from the field strength of unresolved structures. The observation of
spectral lines with strong coupling with hyperfine structure, like the observed
MnI line at 553.7 nm, allows such differentiation.
  The main aim is to analyse the distribution of field strengths in the network
and intranetwork of the solar photosphere through inversion of the MnI line at
553.7 nm.
  An inversion code for the magnetic field using the Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) has been developed. Statistical tests are run on the code to
validate it. The code has to draw information from the small-amplitude spectral
feature oppearing in the core of the Stokes V profile of the observed line for
field strengths below a certain threshold, coinciding with lower limit of the
Paschen-Back effect in the fine structure of the involved atomic levels.
  The inversion of the observed profiles, using the circular polarization (V)
and the intensity (I), shows the presence of magnetic fields strengths in a
range from 0 to 2 kG, with predominant weak strength values. Mixed regions with
mean strength field values of 1130 and 435 Gauss are found associated with the
network and intranetwork respectively.
  The MnI line at 553 nm probes the field strength distribution in the quiet
sun and shows the predominance of weak, hectoGauss fields in the intranetwork,
and strong, kiloGauss fields in the network. It also shows that both network
and intranetwork are to be understood at our present spatial resolutions as
field distributions of which we hint the mean properties.
