presented. Using the method, the feasibility of recovering SFHs with multi-band
photometry is investigated. The method divides a galaxy's history into discrete
time intervals and reconstructs the average rate of star formation in each
interval. This directly gives the total stellar mass. A simple linear inversion
solves the problem of finding the most likely discretised SFH for a given set
of galaxy parameters. It is shown how formulating the method within a Bayesian
framework lets the data simultaneously select the optimal regularisation
strength and the most appropriate number of discrete time intervals for the
reconstructed SFH. The method is demonstrated by applying it to mono-metallic
synthetic photometric catalogues created with different input SFHs, assessing
how the accuracy of the recovered SFHs and stellar masses depend on the
photometric passband set, signal-to-noise and redshift. The results show that
reconstruction of SFHs using multi-band photometry is possible, being able to
distinguish an early burst of star formation from a late one, provided an
appropriate passband set is used. Although the resolution of the recovered SFHs
is on average inferior compared to what can be achieved with spectroscopic
data, the multi-band approach can process a significantly larger number of
galaxies per unit exposure time.

schemes of 4-canonically embedded curves of genus $g\ge 3$ are the moduli space
$\bar{M}_g^{\text{ps}}$ of pseudo-stable curves constructed by Schubert in
\cite{Schubert} using Chow varieties and 3-canonical models. The only new
ingredient needed in the Hilbert scheme variant is a more careful analysis of
the stability with respect to a certain 1-ps $\lambda$ of the $m^{\text{th}}$
Hilbert points of curves $X$ with elliptic tails. We compute the exact weight
with which $\lambda$ acts, and not just the leading term in $m$ of this weight.
A similar analysis of stability of curves with rational cuspidal tails allows
us to determine the stable and semistable 4-canonical Chow loci. Although here
the geometry of the quotient is more complicated because there are strictly
semi-stable orbits, we are able to again identify it as
$\bar{M}_g^{\text{ps}}$. Our computations yield, as byproducts, examples of
both $m$-Hilbert unstable and $m$-Hilbert stable $X$ that are Chow strictly
semi-stable.

randomly switched systems under a class of switching signals. The switching
signal is modeled as a jump stochastic (not necessarily Markovian) process
independent of the system state; it selects, at each instant of time, the
active subsystem from a family of systems. Sufficient conditions for stochastic
stability (almost sure, in the mean, and in probability) of the switched system
are established when the subsystems do not possess control inputs, and not
every subsystem is required to be stable. These conditions are employed to
design stabilizing feedback controllers when the subsystems are affine in
control. The analysis is carried out with the aid of multiple Lyapunov-like
functions, and the analysis results together with universal formulae for
feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems constitute our primary tools for
control design

time correlations. For a representant of the KPZ class, the polynuclear growth
model, we show that the space-time is non-trivially fibred, having slow
directions with decorrelation exponent equal to 1 instead of the usual 2/3.
These directions are the characteristic curves of the PDE associated to the
surface's slope. As a consequence, previously proven results for space-like
paths will hold in the whole space-time except along the slow curves.

continuous debate in the State of Indiana and nationwide. In Indiana,
highway-related accidents result in about 900 fatalities and forty thousand
injuries annually and place an incredible social and economic burden on the
state. Still, speed limits posted on highways and other roads are routinely
exceeded as individual drivers try to balance safety, mobility (speed), and the
risks and penalties associated with law enforcement efforts. The
speed-limit/safety issue has been a matter of considerable concern in Indiana
since the state raised its speed limits on rural interstates and selected
multilane highways on July 1, 2005. In this paper, the influence of the posted
speed limit on the severity of vehicle accidents is studied using Indiana
accident data from 2004 (the year before speed limits were raised) and 2006
(the year after speed limits were raised on rural interstates and some
multi-lane non-interstate routes). Statistical models of the injury severity of
different types of accidents on various roadway classes were estimated. The
results of the model estimations showed that, for the speed limit ranges
currently used, speed limits did not have a statistically significant effect on
the severity of accidents on interstate highways. However, for some
non-interstate highways, higher speed limits were found to be associated with
higher accident severities - suggesting that future speed limit changes, on
non-interstate highways in particular, need to be carefully assessed on a
case-by-case basis.

Euclidean space is used to derive a 1+1 dimensional hierarchy of integrable
SO(3)-invariant vector models containing the Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin
model as well as a model given by a spin-vector version of the mKdV equation.
These models describe a geometric realization of the NLS hierarchy of soliton
equations whose bi-Hamiltonian structure is shown to be encoded in the Frenet
equations of the moving frame. This derivation yields an explicit
bi-Hamiltonian structure, recursion operator, and constants of motion for each
model in the hierarchy. A generalization of these results to geometric surface
flows is presented, where the surfaces are non-stretching in one direction
while stretching in all transverse directions. Through the Frenet equations of
a moving frame, such surface flows are shown to encode a hierarchy of 2+1
dimensional integrable SO(3)-invariant vector models, along with their
bi-Hamiltonian structure, recursion operator, and constants of motion,
describing a geometric realization of 2+1 dimensional bi-Hamiltonian NLS and
mKdV soliton equations. Based on the well-known equivalence between the
Heisenberg model and the Schrodinger map equation in 1+1 dimensions, a
geometrical formulation of these hierarchies of 1+1 and 2+1 vector models is
given in terms of dynamical maps into the 2-sphere. In particular, this
formulation yields a new integrable generalization of the Schrodinger map
equation in 2+1 dimensions as well as a mKdV analog of this map equation
corresponding to the mKdV spin model in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions.

analytical solution with much reduced complexity is developed from a geometric
perspective. It is shown that both algorithms obtain the same optimal solution.

and workload variability, which lead to uncertainty in resource availability.
This raises great challenges to software design and programming in multitasking
environments. In this paper, the emerging methodology of feedback scheduling is
introduced to address these challenges. As a closed-loop approach to resource
management, feedback scheduling promises to enhance the flexibility and
resource efficiency of various software programs through dynamically
distributing available resources among concurrent tasks based on feedback
information about the actual usage of the resources. With emphasis on the
behavioral design of feedback schedulers, we describe a general framework of
feedback scheduling in the context of real-time control applications. A simple
yet illustrative feedback scheduling algorithm is given. From a programming
perspective, we describe how to modify the implementation of control tasks to
facilitate the application of feedback scheduling. An event-driven paradigm
that combines time-triggered and event-triggered approaches is proposed for
programming of the feedback scheduler. Simulation results argue that the
proposed event-driven paradigm yields better performance than time-triggered
paradigm in dynamic environments where the workload varies irregularly and
unpredictably.

deleterious extra-auditory effects of noise are those leading to sleep
disturbances. These disturbances seem to be related to both endogenous
(physical parameters) and exogenous (sex, age) factors of noise. Despite
correlative relations between noise level and awakenings, the scientific
community has not reached consensus regarding a specific action of these
factors on the different sleep stages. In animal research, 2 complementary main
fields of research exist. One is focused on the positive modulation of sleep by
repeated tone stimulation. The other concerns noise-related sleep disturbances.
The few studies that have investigated noise-related sleep disturbances suggest
the following conclusions. First, sleep disturbances are greater upon exposure
to environmental noise, whose frequency spectrum is characterized by high and
ultrasonic sounds, than white noise. Second, unpredictability and pattern of
noise events are responsible for extractions from both SWS and PS. Third,
chronic exposure to noise permanently reduces and fragments sleep. Finally, in
chronic noise exposure, an inter-individual variability in SWS deficits is
observed and correlated to a psychobiological profile related to an
incapability to face stressful situations. Based on results from other
research, acute noise-related sleep perturbations could result from an
imbalance in the sleep-wake cycle in favor of arousing ascending systems.
Chronic noise-related sleep disturbances may arise due to imbalance of the
sleep-wake cycle and malfunctioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis
which may both contribute to the development of pathology.

foreground, we simulate galaxy catalogs and compute the magnification along
individual lines of sight using the multiple lens plane algorithm. The dark
matter haloes of the galaxies are modelled as gravitational lenses using
singular isothermal sphere or Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. Scaling laws
between luminosity and mass, provided by Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher
relations, are used to estimate the masses of the haloes.
  While our simulations show that the SDSSII supernova survey is marginally
affected by gravitational lensing, we find that the effect will be measurable
in the SNLS survey that probes higher redshifts. Our simulations show that the
probability to measure a significant (3 sigma) correlation between the Hubble
diagram residuals and the calculated lensing magnification is ~95% in the SNLS
data. Moreover, with this data it should be possible to constrain the
normalisation of the masses of the lensing galaxy haloes at the 1 sigma and 2
sigma confidence level with ~30% and ~60% accuracy, respectively.

(pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,
1,2-propanediol, and m-touluidine). The shear-mechanical spectra are obtained
by the piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge (PSG) method. This technique allows
one to measure the shear modulus ($10^{5} -10^{10}$ Pa) of the liquid within a
frequency range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent
response functions to investigate whether time-temperature superposition (TTS)
is obeyed. We also study the shear-modulus loss-peak position and its
high-frequency part. It has been suggested that when TTS applies, the
high-frequency side of the imaginary part of the dielectric response decreases
like a power law of the frequency with an exponent -1/2. This conjecture is
analyzed on the basis of the shear mechanical data. We find that TTS is obeyed
for pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane and in 1,2-propanediol while in the
remaining liquids evidence of a mechanical $\beta$ process is found. Although
the the high-frequency power law behavior $\omega^{-\alpha}$ of the shear-loss
may approach a limiting value of $\alpha=0.5$ when lowering the temperature, we
find that the exponent lies systematically above this value (around 0.4). For
the two liquids without beta relaxation (pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane and
1,2-propanediol) we also test the shoving model prediction, according to which
the the relaxation-time activation energy is proportional to the instantaneous
shear modulus. We find that the data are well described by this model.

frequency-dependent complex conductivity of a superconducting thin film near
the critical temperature. The instrument is based on a broadband measurement of
the complex reflection coefficient, $S_{\rm 11}$, of a coaxial transmission
line, which is terminated to a thin film sample with the electrodes in a
Corbino disk shape. In the vicinity of the critical temperature, the standard
calibration technique using three known standards fails to extract the strong
frequency dependence of the complex conductivity induced by the superconducting
fluctuations. This is because a small unexpected difference between the phase
parts of $S_{\rm 11}$ for a short and load standards gives rise to a large
error in the detailed frequency dependence of the complex conductivity near the
superconducting transition. We demonstrate that a new calibration procedure
using the normal-state conductivity of a sample as a load standard resolves
this difficulty. The high quality performance of this spectrometer, which
covers the frequency range between 0.1 GHz and 10 GHz, the temperature range
down to 10 K, and the magnetic field range up to 1 T, is illustrated by the
experimental results on several thin films of both conventional and high

hydroxyapatite in neutral and acidic fluoridation agents are investigated. For
synthetic hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH = HAp), the elemental depth profiles were
determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to reveal the effect of
fluoridation in nearly neutral (pH = 6.2) and acidic agents (pH = 4.2). Due to
the high surface sensitivity of the technique, the depth profiles have a
resolution on the nm scale. With respect to the chemical composition and the
crystal structure XPS depth profiling revealed very different effects of the
two treatments. In both cases, however, the fluoridation affects the surface
only on the nm scale which is in contrast to recent literature, where a
penetration depth up to several microns was reported. Moreover, evidence is
given that the actual fluoridation depth depends on the pH value. Recently, a
qualitative three layer model was proposed for the fluoridation of HAp in an
acidic agent. In addition to the elemental depth profile, as presented also by
various other authors, we present a quantitative depth profile of the compounds
CaF2, Ca(OH)2 and fluorapatite (FAp) that are predicted by the three layer
model. The analysis of our experimental data exactly reproduces the structural
order of the model, however, on a scale that differs by nearly two orders of
magnitude from previous predictions. Our results also reveal that the amount of
Ca(OH)2 and FAp is small as compared to that of CaF2. Therefore, it has to be
questioned whether such narrow Ca(OH)2 and FAp layers really can act as
protective layers for the enamel.

grains aggregate to form planetesimals, one needs to simultaneously model grain
growth, vertical settling and radial migration of dust in protoplanetary disks.
In this study, we implement an analytical prescription for grain growth into a
3D two-phase hydrodynamics code to understand its effects on the dust
distribution in disks. Methods: Following the analytic derivation of Stepinski
& Valageas (1997), which assumes that grains stick perfectly upon collision, we
implement a convenient and fast method of following grain growth in our 3D,
two-phase (gas+dust) SPH code. We then follow the evolution of the size and
spatial distribution of a dust population in a classical T Tauri star disk.
Results: We find that the grains go through various stages of growth due to the
complex interplay between gas drag, dust dynamics, and growth. Grains initially
grow rapidly as they settle to the mid-plane, then experience a fast radial
migration with little growth through the bulk of the disk, and finally pile-up
in the inner disk where they grow more efficiently. This results in a bimodal
distribution of grain sizes. Using this simple prescription of grain growth, we
find that grains reach decimetric sizes in 10^5 years in the inner disk and
survive the fast migration phase.

longitudinal nonlinear magnetic field generated by a static source. These
solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizons but have a conic
geometry with a deficit angle $\delta$. We find that, as the Born-Infeld
parameter decreases, which is a measure of the increase of the nonlinearity of
the electromagnetic field, the deficit angle increases. We generalize this
class of solutions to the case of spinning magnetic solutions and find that,
when one or more rotation parameters are nonzero, the brane has a net electric
charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameters.
Finally, we use the counterterm method in third order Lovelock gravity and
compute the conserved quantities of these spacetimes. We found that the
conserved quantities do not depend on the Born-Infeld parameter, which is
evident from the fact that the effects of the nonlinearity of the

that the properties of our solution, such as deficit angle, are independent of

superconducting single electron resonator (SSET) coupled to a resonator,
focusing on the regime where the SSET is operated in the vicinity of the
Josephson quasiparticle resonance. We consider a range of coupling strengths
and resonator frequencies to reflect the fact that in practice the system can
be tuned to quite a high degree with the resonator formed either by a
nanomechanical oscillator or a superconducting stripline fabricated in close
proximity to the SSET. For very weak couplings the SSET acts on the resonator
like an effective thermal bath. In this regime the current characteristics of
the SSET are only weakly modified by the resonator. Using a mean field
approach, we show that the current noise is nevertheless very sensitive to the
correlations between the resonator and the SSET charge. For stronger couplings,
the SSET can drive the resonator into limit cycle states where self-sustained
oscillation occurs and we find that regions of well-defined bistability exist.
Dynamical transitions into and out of the limit cycle state are marked by
strong fluctuations in the resonator energy, but these fluctuations are
suppressed within the limit cycle state. We find that the current noise of the

scattering formalism (MSMS). A frequency pass band is shown to be formed near
every Mie resonances inherent in the spheres. The manifestation of the pass

Such a distinction is due to different behavior of the far-field dipolar
interaction between the spheres induced by the external source. The edges of
the pass bands are defined by the guiding wave criterion based on the
light-cone constraint. The criterion of creation of the pass bands correlate

  Results. The mean metallicity profile shows a peak in the center, and gently
declines out to 0.2 R_{180}. Beyond 0.2 R_{180} the metallicity is roughly 0.2
solar and, at variance with recently published expectations based on

equations'' suggests, the main topic of my thesis is the investigation of
generalized solution concepts for differential equations, in particular first
order hyperbolic partial differential equations with real-valued, non-smooth
coefficients and their characteristic system of ordinary differential
equations.
  In Colombeau theory there have been developed existence results that yield
solutions for ordinary and partial differential equations beyond the scope of
classical approaches. Nevertheless this comes at the price of sacrificing
regularity (in general a Colombeau solution may even lack a distributional
shadow). It is prevailing in the Colombeau setting that the question of mere
existence of solutions is much easier to answer than to determine their
regularity properties (i.e. if a distributional shadow exists and how regular
it is). In order order to address these regularity question and encouraged by
the fact that the solution of a (homogeneous) first order partial differential
equation can be written as a pullback of the initial condition by the
characteristic backward flow, a main topic of my thesis deals with the
microlocal analysis of pullbacks of c-bounded Colombeau generalized functions.
  Another topic is the comparsion of Colombeau techniques for solving ordinary
and partial differential equations to other generalized solution concepts,
which has led to a joint article with G\""unther H\""ormann. A useful tool for
this purpose is the concept of a generalized graph, which has been developed in
the thesis.

due to primordial or dynamical processes), the current relaxation time is only

using recent findings that the mass of the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) in extended radio-loud quasars is systematically a few times that of
their counterparts in radio-quiet quasars. This sensitive dependence of radio
jet ejection upon SMBH mass probably arises from the blockage of jets by the
presence of substantial quantities of gas tidally stripped from stars by the
central BH. This disruptive gas, however, will only be available around BHs
with masses less than $M_c ~\gtrsim ~10^8\Msun$, for which the tidal disruption
radius lies outside the SMBH's event horizon. Consequently, we find that AGN
with $M_{BH} > M_c$ can successfully launch jets with a wide range of powers,
thus producing radio-loud quasars. The great majority of jets launched by less
massive BHs, however, will be truncated in the vicinity of the SMBH due to mass
loading from this stellar debris. This scenario also can naturally explain the

very mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and nondemented controls and how
it changes over a two-year period. Morphometric differences with respect to a
template hippocampus were measured by the metric distance obtained from the
Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) algorithm which was
previously used to calculate dense one-to-one correspondence vector fields
between the shapes. LDDMM assigns metric distances on the space of anatomical
images thereby allowing for the direct comparison and quantization of
morphometric changes. We use various statistical methods to compare the metric
distances in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. At baseline, the metric
distances for demented subjects are found not to be significantly different
from those for nondemented subjects. At follow-up, the metric distances for
demented subjects were significantly larger compared to nondemented subjects.
The metric distances for demented subjects increased significantly from
baseline to follow-up but not for nondemented subjects. We also use the metric
distances in logistic regression for diagnostic discrimination of subjects. We
compare metric distances with the volumes and obtain similar results. In
classification, the model that uses volume, metric distance, and volume loss
over time together performs better in detecting DAT. Thus, metric distances
with respect to a template computed via LDDMM can be a powerful tool in
detecting differences in shape in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal
studies.

time for a dissipative current in the causal and dissipative hydrodynamic
equation derived by Israel and Stewart. We point out that the Israel-Stewart
equation is not unique as a causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation, and
the form of the causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation is determined by
the shape of a spectral function reflecting the properties of elementary
excitations in the system we consider. Our method utilizes a relaxation
function, which can be calculated from QCD using the linear response theory. We
show that the relaxation function can be derived from a spectral function for a
microscopic representation of the dissipative current. We also show that the
Israel-Stewart equation is acceptable only as long as the calculated relaxation
function is approximated well by a exponentially damping function, and the
relaxation time can be obtained as its damping time constant. Taking a
baryon-number dissipative current of a plasma consisting of charm quarks and
gluons as a simple example, we present the first calculation of the relaxation
function with use of the spectral function derived employing the quenched
lattice QCD together with the maximum entropy method. The calculated relaxation
function shows a strongly-oscillation damping behaviour due to the charmed
vector hadron $J/\Psi$ surviving above the deconfinement phase transition
temperature in QCD. This result suggests that the applicability of the
Israel-Stewart equation to the baryon-number dissipative current of the charm
quark-gluon plasma is quite doubtful. We present an idea for the improvement of
the Israel-Stewart equation by deriving the hydrodynamic equation consistent
with the strongly-oscillation damping relaxation function.
