idea is to impose the minimal amount of flavor protection to make warped models
compatible with all current flavor and electroweak precision constraints. We
discuss a particular realization of this minimal flavor protection in the quark
sector, by means of a flavor symmetry acting on the right handed down sector.
Hierarchical quark masses and mixing angles are naturally reproduced through
wave function localization, and flavor violating processes are predicted, in
the absence of large brane kinetic terms for the right handed down quarks,
below but not too far from current experimental limits in several channels.
With this new flavor pattern, models with warped extra dimensions can be
accessible through direct production of new resonances at the LHC and also
through precision flavor experiments.

technique at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal
metallic behavior and a resistive transition to the superconducting state at a
critical temperature T_c ~ 6.6 K. Magnetization measurements also show the
onset of superconductivity near 6 K. In contrast, specific heat measurements
manifest no discontinuity at T_c. These results lend support to the conclusion
that the superconductivity is associated with oxygen vacancies that alter the
carrier concentration in a small fraction of the sample, although
superconductivity characterized by an unusually small gap value can not be
ruled-out. Under applied magnetic fields, T_c is suppressed anisotropically for
fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane, suggesting that the
crystalline anisotropy strongly influences the superconducting state.
Preliminary high-pressure measurements show that T_c passes through a maximum
of nearly 14 K at ~ 110 kbar, demonstrating that significantly higher T_c
values may be achieved in the phosphorus-based oxypnictides.

the Wilson loop formed by the quark-antiquark dipole. We model the nucleus by a
metric of a shock wave in AdS_5. We then calculate the expectation value of the
Wilson loop by finding the extrema of the Nambu-Goto action for an open string
attached to the quark and antiquark lines of the loop in the background of an
AdS_5 shock wave. We find three extrema of the Nambu-Goto action: the string
coordinates at the extrema are complex-valued and are given by three different
branches of the solution of a cubic equation. The physically meaningful
solutions for the total DIS cross section are given either by the only branch
with a purely imaginary string coordinate in the bulk or by a superposition of
the two other branches. For both solutions we obtain the forward scattering
amplitude N for the quark dipole-nucleus scattering. We study the onset of
unitarity with increasing center-of-mass energy and transverse size of the

remnant RX J1713.7-3946 by the Suzaku satellite. The observations cover about
two-thirds of the remnant surface. We successfully detected hard X-rays up to ~
40 keV from each pointing. The hard X-ray spectra are described by power-law
functions with photon indices of ~ 3.0, which are larger than those in the
energy region below 10 keV. Connection of the spatially-integrated XIS and HXD
spectra clearly reveals a spectral cutoff in the 0.4--40 keV X-ray spectrum.
This cutoff is interpreted to correspond to the maximum acceleration energy of
electrons emitting synchrotron radiation. The wide-band coverage of Suzaku for
the first time allows us to derive the parent electron spectrum in the cutoff
region, which shows good agreement with theoretical predictions. The inferred
cutoff energy in the spatially-integrated X-ray spectrum indicates that
particle acceleration in the remnant is so efficient that it is almost at the
theoretical limit, the so-called Bohm limit. Based on the Suzaku data, we
present results of multi-wavelength studies from spectral and morphological
points of view. The spectral energy distribution favors the hadronic scenario
rather than the leptonic scenario. For the morphology studies, we compare the
surface brightness maps from the Suzaku XIS and the H.E.S.S. telescope. We
confirm the strong correlation between X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission. In
addition to the correlation, we found that in the bright western rim regions

gamma-ray correlation.

observations of a low-extinction galactic bulge sample from an intensive seven
day campaign. Variations in the red giants are shown to be a strong function of
position within the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) in accord with general
expectations from theory. Amplitudes are greater for stars with larger radii,
whether this results from higher luminosity at the same effective temperature
or lower temperature at a fixed apparent magnitude. Likewise, characteristic
time scales for the variations increase to the upper right in a CMD as does the
ratio of amplitudes measured at 606 nm compared to 814 nm. Characteristic
variation time scales are well matched by low-order radial pulsation modes. The
effective sample discussed here extends from about two magnitudes above the
bulge turnoff at which red giant radii are ~7 R/R_{\odot} at 5,000 K with
typical amplitudes of ~0.5 mmag to ~40 R/R_{\odot} at 4,000 K with amplitudes
of ~3.5 mmag. Variability characteristics are quite similar at any given
position in the CMD, and at levels in the CMD where oscillations are easily
detected nearly all red giants show such. If these variations represent
oscillations with sufficient lifetimes to derive accurate mode frequencies more
extensive observations, e.g. as should soon be provided by the Kepler Mission},

through the small Yukawa bottom coupling in the Standard Model. Even in the
limit where this coupling vanishes, electroweak one-loop effects, through the
top-Higgs Yukawa coupling in particular, can still trigger this reaction. This
contribution is small for Higgs masses around 120GeV but it quickly picks up
for higher Higgs masses especially because the one-loop amplitude develops a
leading Landau singularity and new thresholds open up. These effects can be
viewed as the production of a pair of top quarks which rescatter to give rise
to Higgs production through WW fusion. We study the leading Landau singularity
in detail. Since this singularity is not integrable when the one-loop amplitude
is squared, we regulate the cross section by taking into account the width of
the internal top and W particles. This requires that we extend the usual box
one-loop function to the case of imaginary masses. We show how this can be
implemented analytically in our case. We study in some detail the cross section
at the LHC as a function of the Higgs mass and show how some distributions can
be drastically affected compared to the tree-level result.

giant planets around intermediate mass stars. In the gaseous protoplanetary
disks surrounding rapidly-accreting intermediate-mass stars we show that the
midplane temperature (heated primarily by turbulent dissipation) can reach >
1000 K out to 1 AU. Thermal ionization of this hot gas couples the disk to the
magnetic field, allowing the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to generate
turbulence and transport angular momentum. Further from the central star the
ionization fraction decreases, decoupling the disk from the magnetic field and
reducing the efficiency of angular momentum transport. As the disk evolves
towards a quasi-steady state, a local maximum in the surface density and in the
midplane pressure both develop at the inner edge of the MRI-dead zone, trapping
inwardly migrating solid bodies. Small particles accumulate and coagulate into
planetesimals which grow rapidly until they reach isolation mass. In contrast
to the situation around solar type stars, we show that the isolation mass for
cores at this critical radius around the more massive stars is large enough to
promote the accretion of significant amounts of gas prior to disk depletion.
Through this process, we anticipate a prolific production of gas giants at ~1

large-scale structure formation. Shocks with Mach<5 typically trace mergers and
complex flows, while 5<Mach<20 and Mach>20 generally follow accretion onto

a consistent interacting quantum field theory with this causal structure we
discuss a non-linear SO(1,1) sigma-model, where SO(1,1) is the Lorentz

parameters. It provides an example of a microscopic Poincare invariant quantum
field theory with local action, but non-local physical properties. Being

algorithm for intersection is presented. And its running time is
sqrt(|A|*|B|*|C|) for set operation C = A intersection B, while classical
computation needs O (|A| *|B|) steps of computation in general, where |.|
denotes the size of set. The presented algorithm is the combination of Grover's
algorithm, classical memory and classical iterative computation, and the
combination method decrease the complexity of designing quantum algorithm.The

setting is presented. The spherical model follows closely a twisted magnetic
flux tube Riemannian geometrical model or flux rope in solar physics, presented
previously by Ricca [Solar Physics (1997)]. The spherical model presented here
present new and interesting feature concerning its connection with spherical
steady solar dynamos. One of this new feature is represented by the fact that
the by considering poloidal magnetic field component much weaker than its
toroidal counterpart, one obtains a stretch dynamo action where the Riemannian
solar spherical line element is proportional to differential rotation. This
result is obtained also by using the Vainshtein-Zeldovich stretch, twist and
fold (STF) method to generate dynamos. One notes that for high magnetic
Reynolds of $R{m}=O({10^{7}})$ the dynamo action is present for a corresponding
small stretching factor of $K^{2}=1.6$ where $K^{2}=1$ represents the
unstretched dynamo. The constant stretched dynamos considered here are shown to
be Riemann-flat, where the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes. Solar cycle
dynamos are therefore compatible with the Riemann-flat stretching dynamo model
from solar differential rotation presented here.

  Solar Photosphere","submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A proxy for horizontal electric currents in the solar photosphere was
suggested. For a set of evolving active regions (ARs) observed with {\it Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)} Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) in the high
resolution mode, the dissipation spectrum, $k^2E(k)$, and the spatial structure
of dissipation, i.e., the Stokes dissipation function $\epsilon(x,y)$, were
calculated from the observed $B_z$ component of the magnetic field. These
functions allowed us to calculate (a part of) the horizontal electric current
density in the photosphere. It was shown that as an active region emerges,
large-scale horizontal electric currents are gradually generated and determine
a bulk of dissipation. When an active region decays, the large-scale horizontal
currents decay faster than the small-scale ones. The density of horizontal
currents in active regions is in the range of $<j_h > \sim (0.008 - 0.028)$
A/m$^2$, that is compatible with the density of vertical currents in active
regions. We suggest two possible mechanisms for generation of such horizontal
currents in the photosphere. One of them is the drift motions of charged
particles in the medium of varying plasma pressure gradient in a horizontal
plane at the periphery of a sunspot. Such a drift can produce quasi-circular
closed horizontal currents around sunspots. Another possibility could be an
existence of horizontal axial current inside a highly twisted horizontal
magnetic structure laying in the photosphere along the magnetic neutral line.
The horizontal currents may contribute significantly to the dynamics of the
photosphere/corona coupling, as well as the estimation of non-potentiality of
ARs.

indicating more blue spectral energy distribution, whereas the night-to-night
variability has an infrared character. For the simultaneous UBVRI photometry,
the slopes increase with wavelength from dU/dR=0.23(1) to dI/dR=1.18(1). Such
wavelength dependence is opposite to that observed in non-magnetic cataclysmic
variables, in an agreement to the model of cyclotron emission. The principal
component analysis shows two (with a third at the limit of detection)

possibly correspond to different regions of emission. The scalegram analysis
shows a highest peak corresponding to the 200-min spin variability, its quarter
and to the 30-min and 8-min QPOs. The amplitudes of all these components are

turbulence on the propagation properties of such laser arrays has been studied
in great detail. Our main results show that the atmospheric turbulence may
result in the prohibition of the formation of the optical vortex or the
disappearance of the formed optical vortex, which are very different from that
in the free space. The formed optical vortex with the higher topological charge
may propagate over a much longer distance in the moderate or weak turbulent
atmosphere. After the sufficient long-distance atmospheric propagation, all the

equilibrium charge inhomogeneity, we find that, in the intermediate regime, a
variety of nonstationary states can also exist. We catalog the possibilities we
have seen in our simulations. Within a particular phenomenological model, we
show that linearizing the nonlinear charge continuity equation about a
particularly simple domain wall configuration and analyzing the eigenmodes
allows us to estimate the periods of the solutions to the full nonlinear
equation.

the Gaussian interference channel in a fully distributed fashion via game
theory. This problem has been studied in a number of papers during the past
decade for the case of frequency-selective channels. A variety of conditions
guaranteeing the uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and convergence of
many different distributed algorithms have been derived. In this paper we
provide a unified view of the state-of-the-art results, showing that most of
the techniques proposed in the literature to study the game, even though
apparently different, can be unified using our recent interpretation of the
waterfilling operator as a projection onto a proper polyhedral set. Based on
this interpretation, we then provide a mathematical framework, useful to derive
a unified set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the NE
and the global convergence of waterfilling based asynchronous distributed
algorithms.
  The proposed mathematical framework is also instrumental to study the
extension of the game to the more general MIMO case, for which only few results
are available in the current literature. The resulting algorithm is, similarly
to the frequency-selective case, an iterative asynchronous MIMO waterfilling
algorithm. The proof of convergence hinges again on the interpretation of the
MIMO waterfilling as a matrix projection, which is the natural generalization
of our results obtained for the waterfilling mapping in the frequency-selective
case.

where the network traffic load may vary unpredictably over time. The sampling
in sensors is conventionally time triggered with fixed periods. In this
context, only worse-than-possible quality of control (QoC) can be achieved when
the network is underloaded, while overloaded conditions may significantly
degrade the QoC, even causing system instability. This is particularly true
when the bandwidth of the wireless network is limited and shared by multiple
control loops. To address these problems, a flexible time-triggered sampling
scheme is presented in this work. Smart sensors are used to facilitate dynamic
adjustment of sampling periods, which enhances the flexibility and resource
efficiency of the system based on time-triggered sampling. Feedback control
technology is exploited for adapting sampling periods in a periodic manner. The
deadline miss ratio in each control loop is maintained at/around a desired
level, regardless of workload variations. Simulation results show that the
proposed sampling scheme is able to deal with dynamic and unpredictable
variations in network traffic load. Compared to conventional time-triggered
sampling, it leads to much better QoC in WCSs operating in dynamic

network of corner-sharing triangles. We argue that both low temperature
thermodynamic measurements and the impurity susceptibility induced by dilute
substitution of Ti for Ir are suggestive of significant spin-orbit effects.
Because of uncertainties in the crystal-field parameters, we consider two
limits in which the spin-orbit coupling is either weak or strong compared to
the non-cubic atomic splittings. A semi-microscopic calculation of the exchange
Hamiltonian confirms that indeed large antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
and/or symmetric exchange anisotropy may be present. In the strong spin-orbit
limit, the Ir-O-Ir superexchange contribution consists of unfrustrated strong
symmetric exchange anisotropy, and we suggest that spin-liquid behavior is
unlikely. In the weak spin-orbit limit, and for strong spin-orbit and direct
Ir-Ir exchange, the Hamiltonian consists of Heisenberg and DM interactions. The
DM coupling is parametrized by a three component DM vector (which must be
determined empirically). For a range of orientation of this vector, frustration
is relieved and an ordered state occurs. For other orientations, even the
classical ground states are very complex. We perform spin-wave and exact
diagonalization calculations which suggest the persistence of a quantum spin
liquid in the latter regime. Applications to Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$ and broader

dynamics are found to exhibit universal scaling in terms of a field-dependent
low energy coherence scale. Although the bare applied field is globally
uniform, the effective fields experienced by the conduction electrons and the
$f$-electrons differ because of correlation effects. A continuous
insulator-metal transition is found to occur on increasing the applied field,
closure of the hybridization gap reflecting competition between Zeeman
splitting and screening of the $f$-electron local moments. For intermediate
interaction strengths the hybridization gap depends non-linearly on the applied
field, while in strong coupling its field dependence is found to be linear. For

consider invariant subspaces of a tensor product of irreducible representations
of SU(2). These quantum spaces admit natural sets of commuting observables. We
prove that these operators form a semi-classical integrable system, in the

vectors concentrate on the Lagrangian submanifolds of constant action. The

functional theory (DFT) and ligand field multiplet theory (LFM). We also
present an efficient method, based on symmetry considerations, to compute the
dichroism of the cubic crystal starting from the dichroism of a single
substitutional site. DFT shows that the electric dipole transitions do not
contribute to the features visible in the pre-edge and provides a clear vision
of the assignment of the 1s-->3d transitions. However, DFT is unable to
reproduce quantitatively the angular dependence of the pre-edge, which is, on
the other side, well reproduced by LFM calculations. The most relevant factors
determining the dichroism of Cr K pre-edge are identified as the site
distortion and 3d-3d electronic repulsion. From this combined DFT, LFM approach
is concluded that when the pre-edge features are more intense than 4 % of the
edge jump, pure quadrupole transitions cannot explain alone the origin of the
pre-edge. Finally, the shape of the dichroic signal is more sensitive than the
isotropic spectrum to the trigonal distortion of the substitutional site. This
suggests the possibility to obtain quantitative information on site distortion
from the x-ray linear dichroism by performing angular dependent measurements on
single crystals.

wave theory. We discover a remarkable geometry of the minimum energy surface in
the N-spin space. The classical ground states, called Cartesian or CN-ground
states, whose number grows exponentially with the number of spins N, form a set
of points in the N-spin space. These points are connected by a network of flat
valleys in the N-spin space, giving rise to a continuous family of classical
ground states. Further, the CN-ground states have a correspondence with dimer
coverings and with self avoiding walks on a honeycomb lattice. The zero point
energy of our spin wave theory picks out a subset from a continuous family of
classically degenerate states as the quantum ground states; the number of these
states also grows exponentially with N. In the second part, we present some
exact results. For arbitrary spin-S, we show that localized Z_2 flux
excitations are present by constructing plaquette operators with eigenvalues
\pm 1 which commute with the Hamiltonian. This set of commuting plaquette
operators leads to an exact vanishing of the spin-spin correlation functions,
beyond nearest neighbor separation, found earlier for the spin-1/2 model [G.
Baskaran, S. Mandal and R. Shankar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 247201 (2007)]. We
introduce a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation for the case of general
spin-S, and find a complete set of commuting link operators, similar to the
spin-1/2 model, thereby making the Z_2 gauge structure more manifest. The
Jordan-Wigner construction also leads, in a natural fashion, to Majorana
fermion operators for half-integer spin cases and hard-core boson operators for
integer spin cases, strongly suggesting the presence of Majorana fermion and
boson excitations in the respective low energy sectors.

in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations. Recent observations suggest the
possibility that the beating results from the Berry-phase pickup by the

In this study, we also observed beats in the AB oscillations in a gate-defined
closed-loop interferometer fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional
electron-gas heterostructure. Since this heterostructure has very small SOI,
the picture of the Berry-phase pickup is ruled out. The observation of beats in
this study, with the controllability of forming a single transverse subband
mode in both arms of our gate-defined interferometer, also rules out the
often-claimed multiple transverse subband effect. It is observed that nodes of
the beats with an h/2e period exhibit a parabolic distribution for varying the
side gate. These results are shown to be well interpreted, without resorting to
the SOI effect, by the existence of two-dimensional multiple longitudinal modes
in a single transverse subband. The Fourier spectrum of measured conductance,
despite showing multiple h/e peaks with the magnetic-field dependence that are
very similar to that from strong-SOI materials, can also be interpreted as the
two-dimensional multiple-longitudinal-modes effect.

state at non-ferromagnetic compositions (z >= 0.6), while more moderate Pr
substitutions (0.2 <= z <= 0.4) induce a spin reorientation transition within
the ferromagnetic phase.
  A large magnetic susceptibility is detected at {Tc,TN} < T < 250K at all

assigned to the intergrowth of a ferromagnetic pseudocubic phase
(La(1-z)Pr(z))(1-x)Sr(x)MnO3, with an overall volume fraction estimated as
0.5-0.7% from magnetometry. Evidence is provided for the coupling of the
magnetic moments of these inclusions with the magnetic moments of the

combination. The advantages of VoIP in comparison to classic telephony are
location independence, simplification of transport networks, ability to
establish multimedia communications and the low costs. Nevertheless one can
easily see, that combining two technologies, always brings up new challenges
and problems that have to be solved. It is undeniable that one of the most
annoying facet of the Internet nowadays is email spam. According to different
sources email spam is considered to be 80 to 90 percent of the email traffic
produced. The threat of so called voice spam or Spam over Internet Telephony
(SPIT) is even more fatal, for the annoyance and disturbance factor is much
higher. As instance an email that hits the inbox at 4 p.m. is useless but will
not disturb the user much. In contrast a ringing phone at 4 p.m. will lead to a
much higher disturbance. From the providers point of view both email spam and
voice spam produce unwanted traffic and loss of trust of customers into the
service. In order to mitigate this threat different approaches from different
parties have been developed. This paper focuses on state of the art anti voice
spam solutions, analyses them and reveals their weak points. In the end a SPIT

probability density function of the temperature or its fluctuations is found to
be always non-Gaussian. The asymmetry and strength of deviations from the
Gaussian distribution are quantified as a function of the cell height. The
deviations of the temperature fluctuations from the local isotropy, as measured
by the skewness of the vertical derivative of the temperature fluctuations,
decrease in the bulk, but increase in the thermal boundary layer for growing
Rayleigh number, respectively. Similar to the passive scalar mixing, the
probability density function of the thermal dissipation rate deviates
significantly from a log-normal distribution. The distribution is fitted well
by a stretched exponential form. The tails become more extended with increasing
Rayleigh number which displays an increasing degree of small-scale
intermittency of the thermal dissipation field for both the bulk and the
thermal boundary layer. We find that the thermal dissipation rate due to the
temperature fluctuations is not only dominant in the bulk of the convection
cell, but also yields a significant contribution to the total thermal
dissipation in the thermal boundary layer. This is in contrast to the ansatz
used in scaling theories and can explain the differences in the scaling of the
total thermal dissipation rate with respect to the Rayleigh number.

pulse excitation is driven by thermal phenomena of different origins the
accurate description of which is crucial for interpreting experimental results:
hot electron gas generation, electron-phonon coupling, heat transfer to the
particle environment and heat propagation in the latter. Regardingthis last
mechanism, it is well known that heat transport in nanoscale structures and/or
at ultrashort timescales may deviate from the predictions of the Fourier law.
In these cases heat transport may rather be described by the Boltzmann
transport equation. We present a numerical model allowing us to determine the
electron and lattice temperature dynamics in a spherical gold nanoparticle core
under subpicosecond pulsed excitation, as well as that of the surrounding shell
dielectric medium. For this, we have used the electron-phonon coupling equation
in the particle with a source term linked with the laser pulse absorption, and
the ballistic-diffusive equations for heat conduction in the host medium.
Either thermalizing or adiabatic boundary conditions have been considered at
the shell external surface. Our results show that the heat transfer rate from
the particle to the matrix can be significantly smaller than the prediction of
Fourier's law. Consequently, the particle temperature rise is larger and its
cooling dynamics might be slower than that obtained by using Fourier's law.
This difference is attributed to the nonlocal and nonequilibrium heat
conduction in the vicinity of the core nanoparticle. These results are expected
to be of great importance for analyzing pump-probe experiments performed on
single nanoparticles or nanocomposite media.

first obtain the second quantized expression for the EM field with boundary

any analytic continuation techniques. The second approach involves the routine
zeta function regularization along with some analytic continuation techniques.
Our two approaches yield identical results. This energy has been calculated
previously for the EM field in a rectangular waveguide using an indirect
approach invoking analogies between EM fields and massless scalar fields, and
using complicated analytic continuation techniques, and the results are
identical to ours. We have also calculated the pressures on different sides and
the total Casimir energy per unit length, and plotted these quantities as a
function of the cross-sectional dimensions of the waveguide. We also present a
physical discussion about the rather peculiar effect of the change in the sign
of the pressures as a function of the shape of the cross-sectional area.

shown that, under some circumstances, the conditions for stability of

Galcons are initialized at high redshift (z~3) after galaxy dark matter halos
have formed but before the cluster has virialized. Each galcon moves
self-consistently within the evolving cluster potential and injects mass,
metals, and energy into intracluster (IC) gas through a well-resolved spherical

refinement code and carried out a simulation of cluster formation in a
LambdaCDM universe. With our approach, we are able to economically follow the
impact of a large number of galaxies on IC gas. We compare the results of the
galcon simulation with a second, more standard simulation where star formation
and feedback are treated using a popular heuristic prescription. One advantage
of the galcon approach is explicit control over the star formation history of
cluster galaxies. Using a galactic SFR derived from the cosmic star formation
density, we find the galcon simulation produces a lower stellar fraction, a
larger gas core radius, a more isothermal temperature profile, and a flatter
metallicity gradient than the standard simulation, in better agreement with

sticking of smaller dust aggregates has to face at least two severe obstacles,
namely the rapid loss of material due to radial inward drift and particle
fragmentation due to destructive collisions. We present a scenario to
circumvent these two hurdles. Our dust evolution model involves two main
mechanisms. First, we consider a disk with a dead zone. In an almost laminar
region close to the midplane, the relative velocities of the turbulent
particles are comparatively small, which decreases the probability of
destructive particle collisions. Second, turbulence is not the only source of
violent relative particle velocities, because high radial drift speeds can also
lead to boulder fragmentation. For this reason, we focus additionally on the
snow line. Evaporation fronts can be associated with gas pressure maxima in
which radial drift basically vanishes. This implies that particle fragmentation
becomes even less likely. Our simulation results suggest that particles can
overcome the fragmentation barrier. We find that boulders of several 100 m can
form within only a few thousand years.

source classification, we observe an abrupt deceleration in FR-I jets while
relativistic motions persist up to Mpc scale in FR-II. Moreover, VLBI
observations of some object like B2 1144+35, Mrk501 and M87 show limb
brightening of the jet radio emission at the parsec scale. This effect is
interpreted kinematically as due to the presence of a deboosted central spine
at high Lorentz factor and of a weakly relativistic external layer. In this
paper we investigate whether these effects can be interpreted by a breaking of
the collimated flow by external medium entrainment favored by shear
instabilities, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We examine in details the
physical conditions under which significant deceleration of a relativistic flow
is produced. We investigate the phenomenon by means of high-resolution
three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code
for computational astrophysics. We find that the parameter of utmost importance
in determining the instability evolution and the entrainment properties is the
ambient/jet density contrast. We show that lighter jets suffer stronger slowing
down in the external layer than in the central part and conserve a central
spine at high Lorentz factor. Our model is verified by constructing synthetic
emission maps from the numerical simulations that compare reasonably well with
VLBI observations of the inner part of FR-I sources.

and so it has been intensively studied during recent years. Previous work has
shown the relevance of some features, such as the synchronicity of the
updating, the clustering of the network or the influence of the update rule.
This has been done, however, for concrete settings with particular games,
networks and update rules, with the consequence that some contradictions have
arisen and a general understanding of these topics is missing in the broader
context of the space of 2x2 games. To address this issue, we have performed a
systematic and exhaustive simulation in the different degrees of freedom of the
problem. In some cases, we generalize previous knowledge to the broader context
of our study and explain the apparent contradictions. In other cases, however,
our conclusions refute what seems to be established opinions in the field, as
for example the robustness of the effect of spatial structure against changes
in the update rule, or offer new insights into the subject, e.g. the relation

length of the shortest intervals based on the hard-thresholding estimator is
larger than the length of the shortest interval based on the adaptive LASSO,
which is larger than the length of the shortest interval based on the LASSO,

they were much more massive than the Pop II and Pop I stars observed today.
This is due to the collapse dynamics of metal-free gas, which is regulated by
the radiative cooling of molecular hydrogen. We study how the collapse of gas
clouds is altered by the addition of metals to the star-forming environment by
performing a series of simulations of pre-enriched star formation at various
metallicities. For metallicities below the critical metallicity, Z_cr, collapse
proceeds similarly to the metal-free case, and only massive objects form. For
metallicities well above Z_cr, efficient cooling rapidly lowers the gas
temperature to the temperature of the CMB. The gas is unable to radiatively
cool below the CMB temperature, and becomes thermally stable. For high
metallicities, Z >= 10^-2.5 Zsun, this occurs early in the evolution of the gas
cloud, when the density is still relatively low. The resulting cloud-cores show
little or no fragmentation, and would most likely form massive stars. If the
metallicity is not vastly above Z_cr, the cloud cools efficiently but does not
reach the CMB temperature, and fragmentation into multiple objects occurs. We
conclude that there were three distinct modes of star formation at high
redshift (z >= 4): a `primordial' mode, producing massive stars (10s to 100s
Msun) at very low metallicities (Z <= 10^-3.75 Zsun); a CMB-regulated mode,
producing moderate mass (10s of Msun) stars at high metallicites (Z >= 10^-2.5
Zsun at redshift z ~ 15-20); and a low-mass (a few Msun) mode existing between
those two metallicities. As the universe ages and the CMB temperature
decreases, the range of the low mass mode extends to higher metallicities,
eventually becoming the only mode of star formation. (Abridged)

to liquid transition at 26.2C and a fluid to fluid transition at 31C. The
occurrence of melting at a volume fraction of 0.85 and the absence of change in

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) channels assuming binary inputs and binary
signature codes in the presence of additive noise with an arbitrary
distribution. The envelope of this family gives a relatively tight lower bound
in terms of the number of users, spreading gain and the noise distribution. The
derivation methods for the noiseless and the noisy channels are different but
when the noise variance goes to zero, the noisy channel bound approaches the
noiseless case. The behavior of the lower bound shows that for small noise
power, the number of users can be much more than the spreading gain without any
significant loss of information (overloaded CDMA). A conjectured upper bound is
also derived under the usual assumption that the users send out equally likely
binary bits in the presence of additive noise with an arbitrary distribution.
As the noise level increases, and/or, the ratio of the number of users and the
spreading gain increases, the conjectured upper bound approaches the lower
bound. We have also derived asymptotic limits of our bounds that can be
compared to a formula that Tanaka obtained using techniques from statistical
physics; his bound is close to that of our conjectured upper bound for large

adequate bandwidth for efficient continuum observations as well as sufficient
spectral resolution (40 kHz) for observations of narrow lines. We demonstrate
that the polarimetry specific calibrations are handled with sufficient
precision, in particular the relative phase between the Observatory's two
orthogonally linearly polarized receivers. The many facets of instrumental
polarization are studied at 3mm wavelength in all Stokes parameters: on-axis
with point sources and off-axis with beam maps. Stokes Q which is measured as
the power difference between the receivers is affected by instrumental
polarization at the 1.5% level. Stokes U and V which are measured as cross
correlations are very little affected (maximum sidelobes 0.6% (U) and 0.3%
(V)). These levels critically depend on the precision of the receiver
alignment. They reach these minimum levels set by small ellipticities of the
feed horns when alignment is optimum (<~ 0.3""). A second critical prerequisite
for low polarization sidelobes turned out to be the correct orientation of the
polarization splitter grid. Its cross polarization properties are modeled in
detail. XPOL observations are therefore limited only by receiver noise in
Stokes U and V even for extended sources. Systematic effects set in at the 1.5%
level in observations of Stokes Q. With proper precautions, this limitation can
be overcome for point sources. Stokes Q observations of extended sources are
the most difficult with XPOL.

indicates that the strong temperature dependence of $R_H$ cannot be easily
understood with the simple multi-band model either. A picture concerning a
suppression to the density of states at the Fermi energy in lowering
temperature is more reasonable. A comparison between the Hall coefficient of
the undoped sample and the superconducting sample suggests that the doping may
remove the nesting condition for the formation of the SDW order, since both
samples have very similar temperature dependence above 175 K.

manifestation, indeed the epitome, of the very paradoxical and mysterious
nature of quantum theory itself. It is commonly regarded as genuinely quantum
and essentially paradoxical. Although a common approach to teleportation
amongst physicists nowadays is a somewhat operational one, some researchers are
making an effort to deflate the above views.
  On the one hand, it was recently argued that the paradox of information
transfer taking place in teleportation is dissolved (Timpson, 2006) by
appealing the very notion of information. On the other hand, it was
demonstrated that some classical versions of teleportation retain its important
features, which hitherto were considered genuinely quantum (Cohen, 2003;
Collins&Popescu, 2002; Hardy, 1999; Mor, 2006; Spekkens, 2007).
  I will present a special version of a quantum teleportation protocol which is
in a sense split into classical and quantum steps. This description provides us
with a unified picture of teleportation in both domains. It will be explicitly
shown how classical teleportation is embedded in the quantum protocol.
Moreover, the classical step can be successfully accomplished even if the state
shared by the parties is completely disentangled [this is consistent with the
result obtained in (Wang, 2005)]. Yet, all the (apparent) paradoxical features
usually associated with quantum teleportation are clearly present in this step.
In particular, this demonstrates that entanglement cannot be ultimately
responsible and not necessary for the (paradoxical?) information transfer.
  Thus, even if one considers teleportation as mysterious, all its mysteries
are shifted from quantum domain into purely classical one.

discuss the origin of enigmatic correlations that turn a doped NaCoO2 into a
strongly correlated electronic system. A minimal model including orbital
degeneracy is proposed and its predictions are discussed. The model is based on
a key property of cobalt oxides - the spin-state quasidegeneracy of CoO6
octahedral complex - which has been known, e.g., in the context of an unusual
physics of LaCoO3 compound. Another important ingredient of the model is the
90-degree Co-O-Co bonding in NaxCoO2 which allows nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}-e_g$
hopping. This hopping introduces a dynamical mixture of electronic
configurations $t_{2g}^6, S=0$ and $t_{2g}^5e_g^1, S=1$ of neighboring cobalt
ions. We show that scattering of charge carriers on spin-state fluctuations
suppresses their coherent motion and leads to the spin-polaron physics at
$x\sim 1$. At larger doping when coherent fermionic bands are formed, the model
predicts singlet superconductivity of extended s-wave symmetry. The presence of
low-lying spin states of Co$^{3+}$ is essential for the pairing mechanism.
Implications of the model for magnetic orderings are also discussed.

that the dynamical response only for an adiabatic approximation of mass loss
can simultaneously account for the rotation velocity and disc size as observed
particularly in dwarf spiral galaxies, thus reproducing the Tully-Fisher
relation and the size versus magnitude relation over the full range of

La(O,F)FeAs. TEP dramatically changes from positive to negative in the
nonsuperconducting as-grown sample to the superconducting samples with oxygen
deficiency. While $R_H$ is always negative for all samples (even for Sr-doped
as grown sample). It suggests that the $La_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}O_{1-\delta}FeAs$ is
still electron-type superconductor.

orbital eccentricities of the terrestrial planets after their formation via

planetesimals during and after the giant impact stage are unknown, because
simulations of planetary accretion in the runaway growth and giant impact
stages have been conducted independently. Here we report results of direct
N-body simulations of the formation of terrestrial planets beginning with a
compact planetesimal disk. The initial planetesimal disk has a total mass and
angular momentum as observed for the terrestrial planets, and we vary the width
(0.3 and 0.5AU) and the number of planetesimals (1000-5000). This initial
configuration generally gives rise to three final planets of similar size, and
sometimes a fourth small planet forms near the location of Mars. Since a
sufficient number of planetesimals remains, even after the giant impact phase,
the final orbital eccentricities are as small as those of the Earth and Venus.

fundamental importance for the understanding of mathematical aspects of
supersymmetric and other extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics,
which may play an increasingly important role at the beginning of the LHC era.
The interplay between the two-component and the four-component formalism is
highlighted in an introductory way. Majorana particles are predicted both by
grand unified theories, in which these particles are neutrinos, and by
supersymmetric theories, in which they are photinos, gluinos and other states.

representations of this group we associate a Fock space of 'cosmological

Milne's spacetime into 'slices' of fixed macroscopic width in age, with
'cosmological rays' defined on (hyperbolic) slice boundaries-Fock space
attaching only to these exceptional universe ages. Each (fixed-age) preon
locates within a 6-dimensional manifold, one of whose 3 'extra' dimensions
associates in Dirac sense to a self-adjoint operator that represents preon
(continuous) local time, the operator canonically-conjugate thereto
representing preon (total) energy. Self-adjoint-operator expectations at any
spacetime-slice boundary prescribe throughout the following slice a
non-fluctuating 'mundane reality'- electromagnetic and gravitational potentials
'tethered' to current densities of locally-conserved electric charge and
energy-momentum. The ray at the upper boundary of a slice is determined from
the lower-boundary ray by branched slice-traversing Feynman paths that carry
(divergence-free) potential-depending action. A macroscopically-stable
positive-energy single-preon wave function identifies either with a
Standard-Model elementary particle or with a graviton. Within
intermediate-density universe regions such as the solar system, where

  In this paper, we prove that the Gaussian Liouville number and its relatives

  We use methods similar to that of Dekking's proof of the transcendence of the
Thue--Morse number \cite{Dek1} as well as a theorem of Mahler's \cite{Mahl1}.
(For completeness we provide proofs of all needed results.) This method
involves proving the transcendence of formal power series arising as generating

heavy ion reactions. This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic
Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate
hydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.
Event-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the
non-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and
string fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional
ideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons
via the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation
within UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a
realistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic
transport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same
initial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the
underlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory
- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are
investigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the
baryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion
and proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the
isentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are
enhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution. The
results of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation
function, rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species
at three different beam energies are discussed in the context of the available
data.
