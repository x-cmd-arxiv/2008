to 30 Dor, and is important as a laboratory for understanding how massive young
stellar clusters interact with the surrounding interstellar medium. Here, we
present deep (300ks) X-ray imagery of NGC604 obtained as part of the Chandra
ACIS Survey of M33 (ChASeM33), which show highly structured X-ray emission
covering ~70% of the full Halpha extent of NGC604. The main bubbles and
cavities in NGC604 are filled with hot (kT=0.5keV) X-ray emitting gas and X-ray
spectra extracted from these regions indicate that the gas is thermal. For the
western part of NGC604 we derive an X-ray gas mass of ~4300M_sol and an
unabsorbed (0.35-2.5keV) X-ray luminosity of L_X = 9.3E35 erg/s. These values
are onsistent with a stellar mass loss bubble entirely powered by about 200
OB-stars. This result is remarkable because the standard bubble model tends to
underpredict the luminosity of X-ray bright bubbles and usually requires
additional heating from SNRs. Given a cluster age of ~3Myr it is likely that
the massive stars have not yet evolved into SNe. We detect two discrete spots
of enhanced and harder X-ray emission, which we consider to be fingerprints
from a reverse shock produced by a supersonic wind after it collided with the
shell wall. In the eastern part of NGC604 the X-ray gas mass amounts to
~1750M_sol. However, mass loss from young stars cannot account for the
unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of L_X = 4.8E35 erg/s. Off-center SNRs could
produce the additional luminosity. The bubbles in the east seem to be much
older and were most likely formed and powered by stars and SNe in the past.

potential systems which are constructed with single conservation laws having no

classes of porous medium equations and then using the corresponding conserved

symmetries. The provenance of potential symmetries is explained for the porous
medium equations by using potential equivalence transformations. Point and

on potential symmetries and corresponding invariant solutions from known ones.

considering a supersonic phase transition and using a simplified equation of
state, but our calculations are general relativistic (using 2D simulations in
the conformally flat approximation) as compared with their 3D Newtonian
treatment. We also improved the treatment of the initial phase transformation,
avoiding the introduction of artificial convection. As before, we find that the
emitted gravitational-wave spectrum is dominated by the fundamental
quasi-radial and quadrupolar pulsation modes but the strain amplitudes are much
smaller than suggested previously, which is disappointing for the detection
prospects. However, we see significantly smaller damping and observe a
nonlinear mode resonance which substantially enhances the emission in some
cases. We explain the damping mechanisms operating, giving a different view
from the previous work. Finally, we discuss the detectability of the
gravitational waves, showing that the signal-to-noise ratio for current or
second generation interferometers could be high enough to detect such events in
our Galaxy, although third generation detectors would be needed to observe them

corona and particle transport to the chromosphere. Using satellites available
to date it has become possible to distinguish between the two processes of
acceleration and transport, and study the particle propagation in flare loops
in detail, as well as complete comparisons with theoretical predictions.
  Aims: We complete a quantitative comparison between flare hard X-ray spectra
observed by RHESSI and theoretical predictions. This enables acceleration to be
distinguished from transport and the nature of transport effects to be
explored.
  Methods: Data acquired by the RHESSI satellite were analyzed using full sun
spectroscopy as well as imaging spectroscopy methods. Coronal source and
footpoint spectra of well observed limb events were analyzed and quantitatively
compared to theoretical predictions. New concepts are introduced to existing
models to resolve discrepancies between observations and predictions.
  Results: The standard thin-thick target solar flare model cannot explain the
observations of all events. In the events presented here, propagation effects
in the form of non-collisional energy loss are of importance to explain the
observations. We demonstrate that those energy losses can be interpreted in
terms of an electric field in the flare loop. One event seems consistent with
particle propagation or acceleration in lower than average density in the
coronal source.
  Conclusions: We find observational evidence for an electric field in flare
loops caused by return currents.

advantage of phased array technology: AO40. This would further speed up the
survey performance of the telescope. It is shown how the figure of merit for
survey speed of AO40 would be comparable with that of SKA-precursor facilities,

new surveys that would become possible with AO40 are briefly discussed.

deduction of all propositions of the geometry from axioms, appears to be
imperfect in the sense, that multivariant geometries cannot be constructed by
means of this method. Multivariant geometry is such a geometry, where at the
point P there are many vectors PP', PP'',... which are equivalent to the vector
QQ' at the point Q, but they are not equivalent between themselves. In the
conventional (Euclidean) method the equivalence relation is transitive, whereas
in a multivariant geometry the equivalence relation is intransitive, in
general. It is a reason, why the multivariant geometries cannot be deduced from
a system of axioms. The space-time geometry in microcosm is multivariant.
Multivariant geometry is a grainy geometry, i.e. the geometry, which is partly
continuous and partly discrete. Multivariance is a mathematical method of the
graininess description. The graininess (and multivariance) of the space-time
geometry generates a multivariant (quantum) motion of particles in microcosm.
Besides, the grainy space-time generates some discrimination mechanism,
responsible for discrete parameters (mass, charge, spin) of elementary
particles. Dynamics of particles appears to be determined completely by
properties of the grainy space-time geometry. The quantum principles appear to
be needless.

considered one such problem, determining whether a curve is the boundary of an

more difficult: it is NP-complete to determine whether an immersed disk is the
projection of a surface embedded in space, or whether a curve is the boundary
of an immersed surface in the plane that is not constrained to be a disk.
However, when a casing is supplied with a self-intersecting curve, describing
which component of the curve lies above and which below at each crossing, we
may determine in time linear in the number of crossings whether the cased curve
forms the projected boundary of a surface in space. As a related result, we
show that an immersed surface with a single boundary curve that crosses itself

have a collection of n players or nodes each of whom has a budget for

set of preference weights for each of the remaining nodes; the objective of
each node is to use its budget to buy a set of outgoing links so as to minimize
its sum of preference-weighted distances to the remaining nodes.
  We study the structural and complexity-theoretic properties of pure Nash
equilibria in BBC games. We show that determining the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium in general BBC games is NP-hard. However, in a natural variant,
fractional BBC games - where it is permitted to buy fractions of links - a pure
Nash equilibrium always exists. A major focus is the study of (n,k)-uniform BBC
games - those in which all link costs, link lengths and preference weights are
equal (to 1) and all budgets are equal (to k). We show that a pure Nash
equilibrium or stable graph exists for all (n,k)-uniform BBC games and that all
stable graphs are essentially fair (i.e. all nodes have similar costs). We
provide an explicit construction of a family of stable graphs that spans the
spectrum from minimum total social cost to maximum total social cost. We also
study a special family of regular graphs in which all nodes imitate the ""same""
buying pattern, and show that if n is sufficiently large no such regular graph
can be a pure Nash equilibrium. We analyze best-response walks on the
configuration defined by the uniform game. Lastly, we extend our results to the
case where each node seeks to minimize its maximum distance to the other nodes.

point of confinement deconfinement phase transition. In large N QCD such a
change in theta behavior can be related to the breakdown of the instanton
expansion at some critical temperature T_c. Associating this temperature with
confinement-deconfinement phase transition leads to the description of the
latter in terms of dissociation of instantons into the fractionally charged
instanton quarks. To elucidate this picture, we introduce the nonvanishing
chiral condensate in the deconfining phase and assume a specific lagrangian for
the eta' field in the confining phase. In the resulting picture the high
temperature phase of the theory consists of the dilute gas of instantons, while

brane is replaced by a smoothly decaying warp factor. The electroweak symmetry
of the Standard Model is embedded in a larger symmetry group whose gauge bosons
propagate in the bulk of a warped fifth dimension. This gauge symmetry is
partly broken by UV boundary conditions and by a condensate of a bulk scalar
field. The Higgs boson lives partly in the 5th component of the gauge field,
and partly in the the bulk scalar. The Higgs potential is not UV sensitive if
the condensate vanishes fast enough in the UV region. The soft-wall realization
opens new possibilities for the spectrum and the couplings of the Kaluza-Klein
resonances. We study two particular soft-wall backgrounds: one with resonances
whose masses follow the linear Regge trajectory, and another with a continuum
above a mass gap. We find that constraints on the Kaluza-Klein scale from
electroweak precision tests are less severe than in analogous models with the
IR brane. For the linear spectrum the typical constraint on the lightest
resonance mass is 2 TeV, while the continuum is allowed to start below 1 TeV.

destroyed in interactions. Based on dynamical arguments, we show gas primarily
loses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger. Gas within some
characteristic radius (a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, and
gas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum to
the stars sharing the perturbed disk, fall to the center and be consumed in a
starburst. A similar analysis predicts where violent relaxation of the stellar
disks is efficient. Our model allows us to predict the stellar and gas content
that will survive to re-form a disk in the remnant, versus being violently
relaxed or contributing to a starburst. We test this in hydrodynamic
simulations and find good agreement as a function of mass ratio, orbital
parameters, and gas fraction, in simulations spanning a wide range in these
properties and others, including different prescriptions for gas physics and
feedback. In an immediate sense, the amount of disk that re-forms can be
understood in terms of well-understood gravitational physics, independent of
details of ISM gas physics or feedback. This allows us to explicitly quantify
the requirements for such feedback to (indirectly) enable disk survival, by
changing the pre-merger gas content and distribution. The efficiency of disk
destruction is a strong function of gas content: we show how and why
sufficiently gas-rich major mergers can, under general conditions, yield
systems with small bulges (B/T<0.2). We provide prescriptions for inclusion of

chondrule formation and the FU Orionis phenomenon can be caused by the

two scenarios for bursting dead zones can work, in principle. If the disk is on
the verge of fragmention, GI activation near $r\sim4$ to 5 AU can produce
chondrule-forming shocks, at least under extreme conditions. Mass fluxes are
also high enough during the onset of GIs to suggest that the outburst is
related to an FU Orionis phenomenon. This situation is demonstrated by
numerical simulations. In contrast, as supported by analytic arguments, if the
burst takes place close to $r\sim1$ AU, then even low pitch angle spiral waves
can create chondrule-producing shocks and outbursts. We also study the
stability of the massive disks in our simulations against fragmentation and
find that although disk evolution is sensitive to changes in opacity, the disks

contribution to the angular power spectrum of unresolved radio point sources is
included either when optimally constructing the CMB angular power spectrum, as
with WMAP data, or when extracting cosmological parameters, we suggest that

This is especially necessary at high frequencies above 150 GHz, where the
clustering of far-IR sources is expected to dominate the shot-noise level of
the angular power spectrum at tens of arcminute angular scales of both radio
and sub-mm sources. We make an estimate of source clustering of unresolved
radio sources in both WMAP and ACBAR, and marginalize over the amplitude of
source clustering in each CMB data set when model fitting for cosmological
parameters. For the combination of WMAP 5-year data and ACBAR, we find that the

clustering with future datasets such as Planck, especially to properly model
fit anisotropies at arcminute angular scales. If clustering is not accounted

$Z_M$, where $M \geq |G|^{\delta(c)}$ and $\alpha(c), \delta(c) > 0$ are

  This addresses a question of Trevisan, and is proved by scaling down

Our results are twofold. First, we identify a large class of quantum
Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can

stoquastic local Hamiltonians with a ""frustration free"" ground-state. A
Hamiltonian belongs to this class iff it can be represented as $H=\sum_a H_a$

(2) every term $H_a$ has real non-positive off-diagonal matrix elements in the
standard basis, and (3) the ground-state of $H$ is a ground-state of every term
$H_a$. Secondly, we generalize the Cook-Levin theorem proving NP-completeness
of the satisfiability problem to the complexity class MA -- a probabilistic
analogue of NP. Specifically, we construct a quantum version of the k-SAT
problem which we call ""stoquastic k-SAT"" such that stoquastic k-SAT is
contained in MA for any constant $k$, and any promise problem in MA is
Karp-reducible to stoquastic 6-SAT. This result provides the first non-trivial

  Generalizing the argument, it is shown that if we are given an algebra and
subalgebras, A_0\supseteq ... \supseteq A_n, in a prevariety (SP-closed class

  Some further results on coproducts are noted:
  If P satisfies the amalgamation property, one has the stronger ""transitivity""
statement: if A has a finite family of subalgebras (B_i)_{i\in I} such that the
subalgebra of A generated by the B_i is their coproduct, and each B_i has a

relationships are proved between the least number of algebras needed to
generate P as a prevariety or quasivariety, and behavior of the coproduct
operation in P.
  It is shown by example that for B a subgroup of the group S = Sym(\Omega) of
all permutations of an infinite set \Omega, the group S need not have a

sensitive to embedded protostars with Lint > 4E-3 (d/140 pc)^2 solar
luminosities, a factor of 25 better than the sensitivity of IRAS to such
objects. We present selection criteria used to identify candidates from the
Spitzer data and examine complementary data to decide whether each candidate is
truly an embedded protostar. We find a tight correlation between the 70 micron
flux and internal luminosity of a protostar, an empirical result based on
observations and two-dimensional radiative transfer models of protostars. We
identify 50 embedded protostars with Lint < 1 solar luminosities; 15 have Lint
< 0.1 solar luminosities. The intrinsic distribution of source luminosities
increases to lower luminosities. While we find sources down to the above
sensitivity limit, indicating that the distribution may extend to luminosities
lower than probed by these observations, we are able to rule out a continued
rise in the distribution below 0.1 solar luminosities. Between 75-85% of cores
classified as starless prior to being observed by Spitzer remain starless to
our luminosity sensitivity; the remaining 15-25% harbor low-luminosity,
embedded protostars. We compile complete Spectral Energy Distributions for all
50 objects and calculate standard evolutionary signatures, and argue that these
objects are inconsistent with the simplest picture of star formation wherein
mass accretes from the core onto the protostar at a constant rate.

abstraction for sensor networks is challenging due to communication errors and
platform constraints. This paper investigates properties and implementation
reliability for a \emph{local read-write} abstraction. Local read-write is
inspired by the class of read-modify-write operations defined for shared-memory
multiprocessor architectures. The class of read-modify-write operations is
important in solving consensus and related synchronization problems for
concurrency control. Local read-write is shown to be an atomic abstraction for
synchronizing neighborhood states in sensor networks. The paper compares local
read-write to similar lightweight operations in wireless sensor networks, such
as read-all, write-all, and a transaction-based abstraction: for some
optimistic scenarios, local read-write is a more efficient neighborhood
operation. A partial implementation is described, which shows that three
outcomes characterize operation response: success, failure, and cancel. A
failure response indicates possible inconsistency for the operation result,
which is the result of a timeout event at the operation's initiator. The paper
presents experimental results on operation performance with different timeout
values and situations of no contention, with some tests also on various
neighborhood sizes.

gas accretion by means of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations. The disk torque
distribution per unit disk mass as a function of radius provides an important
diagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider
torque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there
is general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present
results of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an
initial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard
parameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup),
the torque distributions per unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration
and accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets
are in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet
migration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through
gas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill
radius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher
planet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet
migrates inwards by only about 20% in radius before achieving a mass of ~1
Mjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by
coorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III
migration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold
and massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before
gap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which
the torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading
side of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.

position representation, we have derived the analytical expressions for the
fidelity, purity and logarithmic negativity (entanglement) of the resulting
quantum state after the long-distance atmospheric transportation. Based on the
derived formulae, the effects of the atmospheric turbulences on the evolutions
of quantum properties of the resulting two-mode quantum state are discussed in
detail under different input parameters of the initial two-mode quantum state.
The results show that the maximal distributing distance of quantum entanglement
is strongly dependent on the atmospheric conditions: when the atmospheric
turbulence becomes stronger and stronger, the maximal distance becomes shorter
and shorter, and both the fidelity and purity decrease quicker and quicker as
functions of propagating distances. Under a certain atmospheric condition, with
the increasing of the input entanglement of the initial two-mode spatially
Gaussian-entangled quantum state, the maximal distributing distance for
preserving the entanglement gradually increases and always has a saturated
(upper) limitation, and both the evolutions of the fidelity and purity are
affected by the input parameters of the initial two-mode quantum state, Finally
the optimal parameters of the input two-mode quantum state with the fixed input
entanglement are discussed in order to obtain the optimal transfer distribution
of the quantum entanglement over a long distance under a certain atmosphere.
Our theoretical results are very helpful for building the distribution of the
quantum entanglement via free-space atmosphere link.

transfers available so far are obtained. With these energies that have improved
more than 50% over that of pure GGA and LDA, we show the density functional
theory predicts the predominance of oxygen defects over uranium ones at any
compositions, which is possible only after treated the localized 5f electrons
properly. Calculations also suggest an upper bound of x~0.03 for oxygen
clusters to start off. The volume change induced by point uranium defects is
monotonic but nonlinear, whereas for oxygen defects, increase x always reduces
the system volume linearly, except dimers that require extra space for
accommodation, which has been identified as meta-stable ionic molecule. Though
oxygen dimers usually occupy Willis O'' sites and mimic a single oxygen in
energetics and charge state, they are rare at ambient conditions. Its
decomposition process and vibrational properties have been studied carefully.
To obtain a general clustering mechanism in anion-excess fluorites
systematically, we also analyze the local stabilities of possible basic
clustering modes of oxygen defects. The result shows an unified way to
understand the structure of Willis type and cuboctahedral clusters in UO2+x and
beta-U4O9. Finally we generalize the point defect model to the independent

fragments which propagate with different velocities along different directions.
The time taken for this conversion to happen is of the order of few $ms$. This
calculation indicates the inadequacy of non-relativistic (NR) or even Special
Relativistic (SR) treatments for these cases.

Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A allow us to test existing models and
determine the physical parameters of various regions of the fast-moving knots
(FMKs), which are metal-dominated clouds of material ejected by the supernova
explosion. Methods: The fluxes of the far-infrared [O i] and [O iii] lines are
extracted from the previously unpublished archival ISO data. The archival
Spitzer data are used to determine the fluxes of the O, Ne, Si, S, Ar and Fe
ion fine-structure lines originating in the FMKs. The ratios of these line
fluxes are used for the plasma diagnostics. We also determine the infrared line
flux ratios to the optical [O iii] 5007 A line in the knots having previously
measured reddening. Additionally, we analyze several optical and near-infrared
observations of the FMKs to obtain clearer insight into the post-shock
photoionized region (PIR) structure. Results: We show that the infrared oxygen
line flux predictions of all existing theoretical models are correct only to
within a factor of several. For the models to reproduce the observations it is
essential to include the electron conductivity and effects of the dust.
Detailed analysis of the diagnostic line flux ratios allows us to qualitatively
confirm the general model of the FMK emission and to determine observationally
the physical conditions in the PIR after the shock front. We infer that the
pre-shock cloud densities most probably constitute several hundred particles
per cm^3. We also determine the Cas A luminosities in the infrared continuum
and lines. We show that accounting for the charge exchange processes in the
post-shock PIR allows us to reproduce most of the relevant spectral line ratios
even in the frame of a single-temperature model of this region. We also
estimate its plasma parameters, thickness, and carbon abundance.

the conflict in the decision step, thirdly, we can take into account the

variants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one

variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not
prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better
performance.
  This paper shows how to use variable views, previously introduced for an
implementation architecture, to derive perfect propagator variants. A model for
views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are proved to
be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as correctness
and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically deriving
propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization, and
channeling are developed for several variable domains. We evaluate the massive
impact of derived propagators. Without derived propagators, Gecode would
require 140000 rather than 40000 lines of code for propagators.

After classifying all elements of this algebra according to their U(1) x SU(3)
and SU(2) transformation properties, we identify the element which might be
associated with the concept of lepton mass. This element is then transformed
into a corresponding element for a single coloured quark. It is shown that -
although none of the three thus obtained individual quark mass elements is
rotationally invariant - the rotational invariance of the quark mass term is
restored when the sum over quark colours is performed.

of spectral characteristics, including variance anisotropy and scale-dependent

well-documented reconnection events, occurring between the positions of Cluster
(X = -14--16 $R_e$) and TC-2 (X = -6.6 $R_e$). Another factor of key importance
is that the magnetometers on the spacecraft are similar. The comparisons
provide further evidence for asymmetry of physical processes in
Earthward/tailward reconnection outflow regions. Variance anisotropy and
spectral anisotropy angles estimated from the multi-scale magnetic fluctuations
in the tailward outflow region show features which are characteristic for
magnetohydrodynamic cascading turbulence in the presence of a local mean
magnetic field. The multi-scale magnetic fluctuations in the Earthward outflow
region are exhibiting more power, lack of variance and scale dependent
anisotropies, but also having larger anisotropy angles. In this region the
magnetic field is more dipolar, the main processes driving turbulence are flow
breaking/mixing, perhaps combined with turbulence ageing and non-cascade
related multi-scale energy sources.

displayed a different behavior in the optical UV and soft X-ray bands. The 4-10
keV flux, most probably dominated by the inverse Compton component, remained
instead constant. The counting statistics in the relatively short AGILE GRID
observation was low and consistent with a constant gamma-ray flux at a level
similar to the maximum observed by EGRET. An estimate of the gamma-ray spectral
slope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2 suggesting that the
peak of the inverse Compton component in the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)

different parts of the SED exclude interpretations predicting highly correlated
flux variability like changes of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field in
simple SSC scenarios. The observed SED changes may instead be interpreted as
due to the sum of two SSC components, one of which is constant while the other
is variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

disagreement (for strong dissipation) between computer simulations and
previously calculated theoretical transport coefficients for a monocomponent

coefficients with the use of a new Sonine approach in the Chapman-Enskog
theory. Our new approach consists in replacing, where appropriate in the
Chapman-Enskog procedure, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution weight function
(used in the standard first Sonine approximation) by the homogeneous cooling
state distribution for each species. The rationale for doing this lies in the
fact that, as it is well known, the non-Maxwellian contributions to the
distribution function of the granular mixture become more important in the
range of strong dissipation we are interested in. The form of the transport
coefficients is quite common in both standard and modified Sonine
approximations, the distinction appearing in the explicit form of the different
collision frequencies associated with the transport coefficients. Additionally,
we numerically solve by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method the
inelastic Boltzmann equation to get the diffusion and the shear viscosity
coefficients for two and three dimensions. As in the case of a monocomponent
gas, the modified Sonine approximation improves the estimates of the standard
one, showing again the reliability of this method at strong values of
dissipation.

quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for the solution of optimization

theoretical foundation of quantum annealing. In particular, theorems are
presented for convergence conditions of quantum annealing to the target optimal
state after an infinite-time evolution following the Schroedinger or stochastic
(Monte Carlo) dynamics. It is proved that the same asymptotic behavior of the
control parameter guarantees convergence both for the Schroedinger dynamics and
the stochastic dynamics in spite of the essential difference of these two types
of dynamics. Also described are the prescriptions to reduce errors in the final
approximate solution obtained after a long but finite dynamical evolution of
quantum annealing. It is shown there that we can reduce errors significantly by
an ingenious choice of annealing schedule (time dependence of the control
parameter) without compromising computational complexity qualitatively. A
review is given on the derivation of the convergence condition for classical
simulated annealing from the view point of quantum adiabaticity using a

transcription factors at sites on the DNA that are not immediately adjacent to
the promoter of interest. This action at a distance is often mediated by the
formation of DNA loops: Binding at two or more sites on the DNA results in the
formation of a loop, which can bring the transcription factor into the
immediate neighborhood of the relevant promoter. Though there have been a
variety of insights into the combinatorial aspects of transcriptional control,
the mechanism of DNA looping as an agent of combinatorial control in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes remains unclear. We use single-molecule techniques
to dissect DNA looping in the lac operon. In particular, we measure the
propensity for DNA looping by the Lac repressor as a function of the
concentration of repressor protein and as a function of the distance between
repressor binding sites. As with earlier single-molecule studies, we find (at
least) two distinct looped states and demonstrate that the presence of these
two states depends both upon the concentration of repressor protein and the
distance between the two repressor binding sites. We find that loops form even
at interoperator spacings considerably shorter than the DNA persistence length,
without the intervention of any other proteins to prebend the DNA. The
concentration measurements also permit us to use a simple statistical
mechanical model of DNA loop formation to determine the free energy of DNA
looping, or equivalently, the J-factor for looping.

constants for the backwards and forwards case is therefore g_b/g_f = (0.92 +/-
0.03), and hence exhibits a qualitatively different behavior from pair
separation in three dimensional turbulence, where g_b > g_f (J Berg et al.,
2006, Phys.Rev.E, 74(1), p.016304). This indicates that previously proposed
explanations for this time asymmetry based on the strain tensor eigenvalues are
not sufficient to describe this phenomenon in two dimensional turbulence. We
suggest an alternative qualitative explanation based on the time asymmetry
related to the inverse versus forward energy cascade. In two dimensional
turbulence, this asymmetry manifests itself in merging eddies due to the
inverse cascade, leading to the observed ratio of Richardson constants.

show that reconnection can completely suppress the disease, both by continuous

observed from the disk with 1.4'' resolution using the Submillimeter Array. We
adopt the disk physical structure derived from a model which fits the spectral
energy distribution of HD169142. We obtain the full three-dimensional
information on the CO emission with the aid of a molecular excitation and
radiative transfer code. This information is used for the analysis of our
observations and previous 12CO J=2-1 and 1.3 mm continuum data. The disk is in
Keplerian rotation and seen at an inclination close to 13 deg from face-on. We
conclude that the regions traced by different CO isotopologues are distinct in
terms of their vertical location within the disk, their temperature and their
column densities. With the given disk structure, we find that freeze-out is not
efficient enough to remove a significant amount of CO from gas phase. Both
observed lines match the model prediction both in flux and in the spatial
structure of the emission. Therefore we use our data to derive the 13CO and
C18O mass and consequently the 12CO mass using standard isotopic ratios. We
constrain the total disk gas mass to (0.6-3.0)x10(-2) Msun. Adopting a maximum
dust opacity of 2 cm2 per gram of dust we derive a minimum dust mass of
2.16x10(-4) Msun from the fit to the 1.3 mm data. Comparison of the derived gas
and dust mass shows that the gas to dust mass ratio of 100 is only possible
under the assumption of a dust opacity of 2 cm2/g and 12CO abundance of 10(-4)
with respect to H2. However, our data are also compatible with a gas to dust
ratio of 25, with a dust opacity of 1 cm2/g and 12CO abundance of 2x10(-4).

measure the mean logarithmic temperature gradients in two radial regions: from
0--2 $J$-band effective radii $R_J$ (excluding the central point source), and
from 2--$4R_J$. We find the outer gradient to be uncorrelated with intrinsic
host galaxy properties, but strongly influenced by the environment: galaxies in
low-density environments tend to show negative outer gradients, while those in
high-density environments show positive outer gradients, suggesting influence
of circumgalactic hot gas. The inner temperature gradient is unaffected by the
environment but strongly correlated with intrinsic host galaxy characteristics:
negative inner gradients are more common for smaller, optically faint, low
radio-luminosity galaxies, whereas positive gradients are found in bright
galaxies with stronger radio sources. There is no evidence for bimodality in
the distribution of inner or outer gradients. We propose three scenarios to
explain the inner temperature gradients: (1) Weak AGN heat the ISM locally,
higher-luminosity AGN heat the system globally through jets inflating cavities
at larger radii; (2) The onset of negative inner gradients indicates a
declining importance of AGN heating relative to other sources, such as
compressional heating or supernovae; (3) The variety of temperature profiles

observed in the 4080-4530 Angstrom range by resonant 2-color 2-photon
ionization spectroscopy. The strongest feature at 4264 Angstrom is estimated to
have an oscillator strength of f=1.4x10^-3, placing an upper limit on the
interstellar abundance of this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon at 4x10^12
cm^-2, accounting for a maximum of ~0.02% of interstellar carbon. This study
opens up the possibility to rigorously test neutral polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons as carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands in the near future.

inhomogeneous vortex tangles, thus generalizing the well known
Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov equations, which do not take them in
consideration. These effects contribute to the mutual friction force ${\bf
F}_{ns}$ between normal and superfluid components and to the vortex tension
force $\rho_s{\bf T}$. These equations are complemented by an evolution
equation for the vortex line density $L$, which takes into account these
contributions. These equations are expected to be more suitable than the usual
ones for rotating counterflows, or turbulence behind a cylinder, or turbulence
produced by a grid of parallel thin cylinders towed across a superfluid,
because in these situations polarization is expected to play a relevant role.

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200809917",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the possible existence of an extended halo of early-type stars
around Cygnus OB2, which is hinted at by near-infrared color-color diagrams,
and its relationship to Cygnus OB2 itself, as well as to the nearby association
Cygnus OB9 and to the star forming regions in the Cygnus X North complex. A
total of 96 early-type stars are identified in the targeted region, which
amounts to nearly half of the observed sample. Most of them have featureless
near-infrared spectra as expected from OB stars at the available resolution.
Another 18 stars that display Brackett emission lines can be divided between
evolved massive stars (most likely Be stars) and Herbig Ae/Be stars based on
their infrared excesses. A component associated with Cygnus OB9/NGC 6910 is
clearly identified, as well as an enhancement in the surface density of
early-type stars at Cygnus X North. We also find a field population, consisting
largely of early B giants and supergiants, which is probably the same as
identified in recent studies of the inner 1-degree circle around Cygnus OB2.
The age and large extension of this population discards a direct relationship
with Cygnus OB2 or any other particular association. Earlier claims of the
possible large extent of Cygnus OB2 beyond its central, very massive aggregate
seem to be dismissed by our findings. The existence of a nearly ubiquitous
population of evolved stars with massive precursors suggests a massive star
formation history in Cygnus having started long before the formation of the
currently observed OB associations in the region.

consumption / mobility / guaranteed deadlines, in suggesting an adaptive
network structure from a concept of MANET.
