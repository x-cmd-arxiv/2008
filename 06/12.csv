obtained by means of an approximate mapping between a spin-1 anisotropic
Hamiltonian onto a fermionic model of noninteracting Bogolioubov quasiparticles
related in turn to the XY spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field. This approach
allows us to express the spin-1 string operators in terms of fermionic
operators so that the dominant contribution to the string correlators at large
distances can be computed using the technique of Toeplitz determinants. As
expected, we find long-range string order both in the longitudinal and in the
transverse channel in the Haldane phase, while in the Neel phase only the
longitudinal order survives. In this way, the long-range string order can be
explicitly related to the components of the magnetization of the XY model.
Moreover, apart from the critical line, where the decay is algebraic, we find
that in the gapped phases the decay is governed by an exponential tail
multiplied by algebraic factors. As regards the usual two points correlation
functions, we show that the longitudinal one behaves in a 'dual' fashion with
respect to the transverse string correlator, namely both the asymptotic values
and the decay laws exchange when the transition line is crossed. For the
transverse spin-spin correlator, we find a finite characteristic length which
is an unexpected feature at the critical point. We also comment briefly the
entanglement features of the original system versus those of the effective

vertices, known as the Curie-Weiss model. It is well-known that the mixing-time
in the high temperature regime ($\beta < 1$) has order $n\log n$, whereas the
mixing-time in the case $\beta > 1$ is exponential in $n$. Recently, Levin,
Luczak and Peres proved that for any fixed $\beta < 1$ there is cutoff at time
$[2(1-\beta)]^{-1} n\log n$ with a window of order $n$, whereas the mixing-time
at the critical temperature $\beta=1$ is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$. It is natural to
ask how the mixing-time transitions from $\Theta(n\log n)$ to $\Theta(n^{3/2})$
and finally to $\exp(\Theta(n))$. That is, how does the mixing-time behave when
$\beta=\beta(n)$ is allowed to tend to 1 as $n\to\infty$.
  In this work, we obtain a complete characterization of the mixing-time of the
dynamics as a function of the temperature, as it approaches its critical point
$\beta_c=1$. In particular, we find a scaling window of order $1/\sqrt{n}$
around the critical temperature. In the high temperature regime, $\beta = 1 -
\delta$ for some $0 < \delta < 1$ so that $\delta^2 n \to\infty$ with $n$, the
mixing-time has order $(n/\delta)\log(\delta^2 n)$, and exhibits cutoff with
constant 1/2 and window size $n/\delta$. In the critical window, $\beta = 1\pm
\delta$ where $\delta^2 n$ is O(1), there is no cutoff, and the mixing-time has
order $n^{3/2}$. At low temperature, $\beta = 1 + \delta$ for $\delta > 0$ with
$\delta^2 n \to\infty$ and $\delta=o(1)$, there is no cutoff, and the mixing
time has order $(n/\delta)\exp(({3/4}+o(1))\delta^2 n)$.

surface is subject to rearrangement beyond the QCP. If the sequence of maps
converges, a multi-connected Fermi surface is formed. If it fails to converge,
the Fermi surface swells into a volume that provides a measure of entropy
associated with formation of an exceptional state of the system characterized
by partial occupation of single-particle states and dispersion of their
spectrum proportional to temperature. Based on this dual scenario, the
thermodynamics of Fermi systems beyond the QCP exhibits striking departures
from the predictions of standard FL theory. Mechanisms for the release of the

energy distribution (SED), or by using the absolutely calibrated SED of the sun
in comparison with solar-type stellar photometry (the solar analog method).
After the rejection of a small number of stars with anomalous SEDs (or bad
measurements), upper limits of ~ 1.5% (rms) are placed on the intrinsic
infrared SED variations in both A dwarf and solar-type stars. These types of
stars are therefore suitable as general-purpose standard stars in the infrared.
We provide absolutely calibrated SEDs for a standard zero magnitude A star and
for the sun to allow extending this work to any other infrared photometric
system. They allow the recommended calibration to be applied from 1 to 25
microns with an accuracy of ~2 %, and with even higher accuracy at specific
wavelengths such as 2.2, 10.6, and 24 microns, near which there are direct
measurements. However, we confirm earlier indications that Vega does not behave
as a typical A0V star between the visible and the infrared, making it
problematic as the defining star for photometric systems. The integration of
measurements of the sun with those of solar-type stars also provides an

audience. With content fast becoming a commodity, interest in using social
networks to promote and find content has grown, both on the side of content
producers (viral marketing) and consumers (recommendation). Here we study the
role of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator
that allows users to submit links to and vote on news stories. Digg's goal is
to feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates
opinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking
sites, Digg allows users to designate other users as ``friends'' and see what
stories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news
stories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the
spread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the
story will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's
neighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through
submitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is
visible already in the early stages of voting, and one can make a prediction
about the potential audience of a story simply by analyzing where the initial
votes come from.

holds a word $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, and wishes to broadcast a codeword to $n$
receivers, $R_1,...,R_n$. The receiver $R_i$ is interested in $x_i$, and has
prior \emph{side information} comprising some subset of the $n$ bits. This
corresponds to a directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, where $i j$ is an edge iff
$R_i$ knows the bit $x_j$. An \emph{index code} for $G$ is an encoding scheme
which enables each $R_i$ to always reconstruct $x_i$, given his side
information. The minimal word length of an index code was studied by
Bar-Yossef, Birk, Jayram and Kol (FOCS 2006). They introduced a graph
parameter, $\minrk_2(G)$, which completely characterizes the length of an
optimal \emph{linear} index code for $G$. The authors of BBJK showed that in
various cases linear codes attain the optimal word length, and conjectured that
linear index coding is in fact \emph{always} optimal.
  In this work, we disprove the main conjecture of BBJK in the following strong
sense: for any $\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$, there is an
$n$-vertex graph $G$ so that every linear index code for $G$ requires codewords
of length at least $n^{1-\epsilon}$, and yet a non-linear index code for $G$
has a word length of $n^\epsilon$. This is achieved by an explicit
construction, which extends Alon's variant of the celebrated Ramsey
construction of Frankl and Wilson.
  In addition, we study optimal index codes in various, less restricted,
natural models, and prove several related properties of the graph parameter
$\minrk(G)$.

treated as equal, and the more fundamental mu and B Higgs potential parameters
are fixed by potential minimization conditions. We find that, if instead a flat
(""natural"")prior measure on mu and B is placed, a strong preference exists for
the focus point region from fits to particle physics and cosmological data. In
particular, we find that the lightest neutralino is strongly favored to be a
mixed bino-higgsino (~10% higgsino). Such mixed neutralinos have large elastic
scattering cross sections with nuclei, leading to extremely promising prospects
for both underground direct detection experiments and neutrino telescopes. In
particular, the majority of the posterior probability distribution falls within
parameter space within an order of magnitude of current direct detection
constraints. Furthermore, neutralino annihilations in the sun are predicted to
generate thousands of neutrino induced muon events per years at IceCube. Thus,
assuming the framework of the CMSSM and using the natural prior measure, modulo
caveats regarding astrophysical uncertainties, we are likely to be living in a
world with good prospects for the direct and indirect detection of neutralino
dark matter.

degree n, Euler wants to define a ""resolvent equation"" of degree n-1 whose
roots are related to the roots of the original equation. Thus by solving the
resolvent we can solve the original equation. In sections 2 to 7 he works this
out for quadratic, cubic and biquadratic equations. Apparently he gives a new
method for solving the quartic in section 5. Then in section 8 Euler says that
he wants to try the same approach for solving the quintic equation and general
nth degree equations. In the rest of the paper Euler tries to figure out in
what cases resolvents will work.

systems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, X-ray-emitting
gas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radio
sources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio
properties themselves. Using these measurements, we examine the ratio between
radio power and total jet power (the radiative efficiency). We find that jet
(cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as P_jet ~
(L_radio)^beta, where 0.35 < beta < 0.70 depending on the bandpass of
measurement and state of the source. However, the scatter about these relations
caused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than four orders of
magnitude. After accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency
(age), the scatter is reduced by ~ 50%, yielding the most accurate scaling
relation available between the lobe bolometric radio power and the jet (cavity)
power. We place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content of
the radio lobes using a variety of X-ray constraints. We find that the lobe
magnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgauss
depending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. If the cavities are
maintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported by
internal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy in
electrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to
4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.

protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to
compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional, but any voter can
cause the protocol to fail, in which case information about the tally may
nevertheless transpire. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which
allow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction
and limiting it to be only between voters and authorities and among the
authorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the
authorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is
unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter
can cause the protocol to fail. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against
corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to
revoke incorrect votes. We also discuss the implementation of a simultaneous

accreting black hole X-ray binaries is not understood. It has been suggested
that these variabilities are associated with diskoseismic oscillation modes of
the black hole accretion disk. In particular, in a disk with no magnetic field,
the so-called g-modes (inertial oscillations) can be self-trapped at the inner
region of the disk due to general relativistic effects. Real accretion disks,
however, are expected to be turbulent and contain appreciable magnetic fields.
We show in this paper that even a weak magnetic field (with the magnetic energy
much less than the thermal energy) can modify or ""destroy"" the self-trapping
zone of disk g-modes, rendering their existence questionable in realistic black
hole accretion disks. The so-called corrugation modes (c-modes) are also

this structure and the magnetic flux. We explicitly evaluate the part in the

fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux to flux quantum leads to

analytical density to describe neutral atoms is proposed. This density is
inspired in the Tietz potential model. The parameters of this density are
determined from the normalization condition and from a variational calculation
of the energy, which is a functional of the density. The density is
non-singular at the origin and its specific form is selected so as to fit the
results coming from non-relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations. The main
ingredients of the energy functional are the non-relativistic kinetic energy,
the nuclear-electron attraction energy and the classical term of the electron

to be less important than the other terms and they have been discarded in this
study. When the statistical measure of complexity is calculated in position
space with the analytical density derived from this model, the increasing trend

we consider the resulting decrease in the dark matter annihilation flux due to
centrally destroyed cusps, and we present a new theory for the formation of
close binary nuclei -- the `stalled binary' model. We focus on one particularly
interesting binary nucleus system, the dwarf spheroidal galaxy VCC 128 which is
dark matter dominated at all radii. We show that its nuclei would rapidly
coalesce within a few million years if it has a central dark matter cusp slope
steeper than r^{-1}. However, if its initial dark matter cusp is slightly
shallower than a log slope of -0.75 at ~0.1% of the virial radius, then the
sinking nuclei naturally create a core equal to their observed separation and
stall. This is close to the log slope measured a recent billion particle CDM

multi-field inflationary setups within string theory; for instance, it can
manifest itself when fields are related to tachyons that condense, or
inter-brane distances that become meaningless when branes annihilate.
Considering a separable potential, and promoting the number of fields to a
smooth time-dependent function, we derive the formalism to deal with these

the scalar spectral index and the running. We recover known results of e.g. a
dynamically relaxing cosmological constant in the appropriate limits. We
further show that isocurvature perturbations are suppressed during inflation,
so that perturbations are adiabatic and nearly Gaussian. The resulting setup
might be interpreted as a novel type of warm inflation, readily implemented
within string theory and without many of the shortcomings associated with warm
inflation.
  To exemplify the applicability of the formalism we consider three concrete
models: assisted inflation with exponential potentials as a simple toy model (a
graceful exit becomes possible), inflation from multiple tachyons (a constant
decay rate of the number of fields and negligible slow roll contributions turns
out to be in good agreement with observations) and inflation from multiple

a phase separation effect that proceeds via spinodal decomposition of the lens

protein content are analyzed with the aid of two methods providing information
on the populations and dynamics of the scattering elements associated with cold
cataract. It is found that the temperature dependence of many measurable

is associated with the onset of cold cataract. Extending the temperature range
of this work to previously inaccessible regimes, i.e. well below the phase
separation or coexistence curve at Tcc, we have been able to accurately
determine the temperature dependence of the collective and self-diffusion
coefficient of proteins near the spinodal. The analysis showed that the
dynamics of proteins bears some resemblance to the dynamics of structural
glasses where the apparent activation energy for particle diffusion increases
below Tcc indicating a highly cooperative motion. Application of ideas
developed for studying the critical dynamics of binary protein/solvent

almost insensitive to density profiles outside the scale radius, combinations
of both effects promise to constrain density profiles of galaxy clusters well,
and thus to allow testing of the CDM expectation on dark-matter halo density
profiles.
  METHODS. We develop an algorithm further that we had recently proposed for
this purpose. It recovers a lensing potential optimally reproducing
observations of both strong and weak-lensing effects by combining high
resolution in cluster cores with the larger-scale information from weak
lensing. The main extensions concern the accommodation of mild non-linearity in
inner iterations, the progressive increase in resolution in outer iterations,
and the introduction of a suitable regularisation term. The linearity of the
method is essentially preserved.
  RESULTS. We demonstrate the success of the algorithm with both idealised and
realistic simulated data, showing that the simulated lensing mass distribution
and its density profile are well reproduced. We then apply it to weak and
strong lensing data of the cluster MS 2137 and obtain a parameter-free solution
which is in good qualitative agreement with earlier parametric studies.

curve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine
transformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this
paper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy
images than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with
other types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral
invariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants
for spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive
variation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of
Euclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature
and the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization
(curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial
point and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore
sensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more
sensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is
not sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence
of curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their
application to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted

accretion rate (${\dot m}$) of the flow. We present all possible accretion
solutions. We find that a significant region of the parameter space in the
${\cal E}-\lambda$ plane allows global accretion shock solutions. The effective
area of the parameter space for which the Rankine-Hugoniot shocks are possible
is maximum when the flow is dissipation free. It decreases with the increase of
cooling effects and finally disappears when the cooling is high enough. We show
that shock forms further away when the black hole is rotating compared to the
solution around a Schwarzschild black hole with identical flow parameters at a
large distance. However, in a normalized sense, the flow parameters for which
the shocks form around the rotating black holes are produced shocks closer to
the hole. The location of the shock is also dictated by the cooling efficiency
in that higher the accretion rate (${\dot m}$), the closer is the shock
location. We believe that some of the high frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations may be due to the flows with higher accretion rate around the

renormalizable minimal SO(10) GUT, and its future prospect.
  It consists of two parts. In part I, I review how the minimal renormalizable
supersymmetric SO(10) GUT, an SO(10) framework with only one ${\bf 10}$ and one
$\bar{\bf 126}$ Higgs multiplets in the Yukawa sector, is attractive because of
its high predictivity. Indeed it not only gave a consistent predictions on
neutrino oscillation data but also did reasonable and interesting values for
Leptogenesis, LFV, muon g-2, neutrinoless double beta decay etc. However, this
model suffers from problems, apart from the small deviations from the observed
values, related to running of gauge couplings and proton decay. The gauge
coupling unification may be spoiled due to the presence of intermediate scales
much lighter than the grand unification (GUT) scale. In addition, the gauge
couplings blow up around the GUT scale because of the presence of Higgs
multiplets of large representations. In order to remedy these pathologies, in
part II, we extend GUT into 5D. We propose two approaches: one is to consider
the warped extra dimension, using the bulk Higgs profile to explain the
intermediate energy scales. Another is to use the orbifold GUT. Both approaches
are complementary to each other.

(1)The PPF has maximum at a longitudinal symmetrical surface of the GB where
the transverse background photon flux (BPF) vanishes; (2) the resonant effect

We show that the structure of the Coulomb branch is consistent with this

s_1,...,s_k in S_n to the permutation obtained by replacing for each i, every
occurrence of g_i in w by s_i. We investigate the random variable X_w^n that
counts the fixed points in this permutation when the s_i are selected uniformly
at random. A major ingredient of our work is a new categorization of words
which considerably extends the dichotomy of primitive vs. imprimitive words. We
establish some results and make a few conjectures about the relation between
the expectation E(X_w^n) and this new categorization.
  This analysis contributes deeply to our study of the spectra of random lifts
of graphs. Let G be a connected graph, and let the infinite tree T be its
universal cover space. If L and R are the spectral radii of G and T
respectively, then, as shown by J. Friedman, for almost every n-lift H of G,
all ""new"" eigenvalues of H are < O(L^(1/2)R^(1/2)). We improve this upper bound
to O(L^(1/3)R^(2/3)), and our aforementioned conjectures suggest a possible
approach to proving an upper bound of O(R). This is a generalization of the
problem of bounding the second eigenvalue in a random 2d-regular graph.
  As an aside, we obtain a new conceptual and relatively simple proof of a
theorem of A. Nica, which determines, for every fixed w, the limit distribution
(as n \to \infty) of X_w^n. A surprising aspect of this theorem is that the
answer depends only on the largest integer d so that w=u^d for some word u.

a cycle about 303(15)d. We analyzed the profile of the composite (or mean)
outburst. We discovered however, that a variety of different outburst heights
and durations had occurred, contrary to theoretical predictions. With
increasing maximum brightness, we find that the decay time also increases; this
is in contrast to the model predictions, which indicate that outbursts should
have a constant shape. This is interpreted as representing the presence of
outburst-to-outburst variability of the magnetospheric radius. A presence of a
number of missed weak narrow outbursts is predicted from this statistical
relationship. A new type of variability is detected, during 3 subsequent nights
in 2007: periodic (during one nightly run) oscillations with rapidly-decreasing
frequency from 86 to 47 cycles/day and a semi-amplitude increasing from 0.06 to
0. 10, during a monotonic brightness increase from 14. 27 to 14. 13. This
phenomenon was observed only during an unusually prolonged event of about 1 mag
brightening in 2007 (lasting till autumn), during which no (expected) outburst
was detected. We refer to this behaviour as to the transient periodic
oscillations (TPO). To study this new and interesting phenomenon, new regular
photometric and spectral (in a target of opportunity mode) observations are

steadily decreasing sizes at fainter fluxes and higher redshifts, reflecting
the hierarchical formation of galaxies over cosmic time. HST has imaged this

objects start to unavoidably overlap because of their own sizes, which only SKA

and Saturn, for example, have several bands of alternating eastward (prograde)
and westward (retrograde) jets relative to the angular velocity of their global
magnetic fields. These surface wind profiles are likely manifestations of the
variations in depth and latitude of angular velocity deep within the liquid
interiors of these planets. Two decades ago it was proposed that this
differential rotation could be maintained by vortex stretching of convective
fluid columns that span the interiors of these planets from the northern
hemisphere surface to the southern hemisphere surface. This now classic
mechanism explains the differential rotation seen in laboratory experiments and
in computer simulations of, at best, weakly turbulent convection in rotating
constant-density fluid spheres. However, these experiments and simulations are
poor approximations for the density-stratified strongly-turbulent interiors of
giant planets. The long thin global convective columns predicted by the classic
geostrophic theory for these planets would likely not develop. Here we propose
a much more robust mechanism for maintaining differential rotation in radius
based on the local generation of vorticity as rising plumes expand and sinking
plumes contract. Our high-resolution two-dimensional computer simulations
demonstrate how this mechanism could maintain either prograde or retrograde
surface winds in the equatorial region of a giant planet depending on how the
density scale height varies with depth.

measurements on magnetoelectric multiferroic CuFe1-xAlxO2 (x=0.0155), which has
a proper helical magnetic structure with incommensurate propagation wave vector
in the ferroelectric phase. The present measurements revealed that the
ferroelectric phase is accompanied by lattice modulation with a wave number 2q,
where q is the magnetic modulation wave number. We have calculated the Fourier
spectrum of the spatial modulations in the local electric polarization using a
microscopic model proposed by Arima [T. Arima, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 073702
(2007)]. Comparing the experimental results with the calculation results, we
found that the origin of the 2q-lattice modulation is not conventional
magnetostriction but the variation in the metal-ligand hybridization between
the magnetic Fe^3+ ions and ligand O^2- ions. Combining the present results
with the results of a previous polarized neutron diffraction study [Nakajima et
al., Phys. Rev. B 77 052401 (2008)], we conclude that the microscopic origin of
the ferroelectricity in CuFe1-xAlxO2 is the variation in the metal-ligand
hybridization with spin-orbit coupling.

of finite cycle groups with generating set given by choosing a generator for
each cyclic factor. In this article we study the spectral theory of the
combinatorial Laplacian for sequences of discrete tori when the orders of the
cyclic factors tend to infinity at comparable rates. First we show that the
sequence of heat kernels corresponding to the degenerating family converges,
after re-scaling, to the heat kernel on an associated real torus. We then
establish an asymptotic expansion, in the degeneration parameter, of the
determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian. The zeta-regularized determinant of
the Laplacian of the limiting real torus appears as the constant term in this
expansion. On the other hand, using a classical theorem by Kirchhoff the
determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian of a finite graph divided by the
number of vertices equals the number of spanning trees, called the complexity,
of the graph. As a result, we establish a precise connection between the
complexity of the Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups and heights of real
tori. It is also known that spectral determinants on discrete tori can be
expressed using trigonometric functions and that spectral determinants on real
tori can be expressed using modular forms on general linear groups. Another
interpretation of our analysis is thus to establish a link between limiting
values of certain products of trigonometric functions and modular forms. The
heat kernel analysis which we employ uses a careful study of I-Bessel
functions. Our methods extend to prove the asymptotic behavior of other
spectral invariants through degeneration, such as special values of spectral
zeta functions and Epstein-Hurwitz type zeta functions.

afterward, a finite neutrino mass can affect all modes of the CMB. In this
work, we expand on earlier studies of the scalar mode effects by constructing
the vector and tensor mode equations in the presence of massive neutrinos and a
PMF. We compute the power spectrum of the various modes in an illustrative
example and find that the neutrino mass can significantly affect the vector and
tensor modes when a PMF exists, while the effects are negligible for no PMF.
The most prominent result of the present analysis is the behavior of the EE
component of the tensor mode at low multipoles. For massive neutrinos the EE
mode can become comparable to the observed primary anisotropy. Therefore, if
and when the EE mode power spectrum is measured at low multipoles the
possibility exists to place a strong constraint on the sum of the neutrino

splitting in a suitable way each path length between two taxa into two lengths.
We prove that the resulting splitted path lengths matrices single out arbitrary

radio emission and the total magnetic field strength grow nonlinearly with SFR.
We also studied the magnetic field structure and disk thicknesses in highly
inclined (edge-on) galaxies. We found in five galaxies that - despite their
different radio appearance - the vertical scale heights for both, the thin and
thick disk/halo, are about equal (0.3/1.8kpc), independently of their different
SFR. They also show a similar large-scale magnetic field configuration,
parallel to the midplane and X-shaped further away from the disk plane,
independent of Hubble type and SFR in the disk. Hence we conclude that the
amplification and formation of the large-scale magnetic field structure is
independent of SFR.

exsting methods such as the perturbation theory, the variational method, the
WKBJ method and other approximation schemes. The current method has been
successfully applied to a variety of interacting systems including the
anharmonic/ double-well oscillators (with quartic-, sextic- and octic
couplings) and the scalar field theory with quartic-coupling in the symmetric
phase. The method yields important insight in to the structure and stability of
the interacting-vacuum of the theory. The results are in good agreement with
the exact predictions of supersymmetry where ever applicable. Possible further
applications in the areas of quantum statistics, finite temperature field

we combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark
phase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an
expanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance
formation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and
obeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball
background is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au
collisions at RHIC. To facilitate the applicability of the Langevin process, we
focus on strange and charm quarks. Their interactions in the QGP are modeled
using leading-order perturbative QCD augmented by effective Lagrangians with
resonances which smoothly merge into hadronic states formed at T_c. The
interaction strength is adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation value
for the quark-elliptic flow, v_{2,q}^{sat}~7-8%. The resulting phi and J/\psi
elliptic flow recover CQNS over a large range in transverse momentum (p_T)

medium (ICM) is not determined by radiative processes alone. If the ICM is in
quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium in the fixed gravitational field of the dark
matter halo then energy losses incurred by the gravitational potential energy
of the gas should also be taken into account. This ""gravitational heating"" has
been known for a while using explicit solutions to the equations of motion.
Here, we re-visit this effect by applying the virial theorem to gas in
quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium in an external gravitational field, neglecting
the gravity of the gas. For a standard NFW form of halo profiles and for a
finite gas density, the response of the gas temperature to changes in the total
energy is significantly delayed. The effective cooling time could be prolonged
by more than an order of magnitude inside the scale radius ($\rs$) of the halo.
Gas lying at a distance twice the scale radius, has negative heat capacity so
that the temperature increases as a result of energy losses. Although external
heating (e.g. by AGN activity) is still required to explain the lack of cool
ICM near the center, the analysis here may circumvent the need for heating in
farther out regions where the effective cooling time could be prolonged to

are avoided. This is done in the light of the generalized sampling theory by
using the oversampling technique: more samples than strictly necessary are
used. For a suitable choice of the sampling period, a necessary and sufficient
condition is given in terms of the Kronecker canonical form of a matrix pencil.
Comparing with other characterizations in the mathematical literature, the
given here has an important advantage: it can be reliable computed by using the

algebra $A$ need not have an identity and the coproduct $\Delta$ does not map
$A$ into $A\otimes A$ but rather into its multiplier algebra $M(A\otimes A)$.
In this paper, we study {\it some tools} that are frequently used when dealing
with such multiplier Hopf algebras and that are typical for working with
algebras without identity in this context.
  The {\it basic ingredient} is a unital left $A$-module $X$. And the basic
construction is that of extending the module by looking at linear maps
$\rho:A\to X$ satisfying $\rho(aa')=a\rho(a')$ where $a,a'\in A$. We write the
module action as multiplication. Of course, when $x\in X$, and when
$\rho(a)=ax$, we get such a linear map. And if $A$ has an identity, all linear
maps $\rho$ have this form for $x=\rho(1)$. However, the point is that in the
case of a non-unital algebra, the space of such maps is in general strictly
bigger than $X$ itself. We get an {\it extended module}, denoted by $\bar X$
(for reasons that will be explained in the paper).
  We study all sorts of more complicated situations where such extended modules
occur and we illustrate all of this with {\it several examples}, from very
simple ones to more complex ones where iterated extensions come into play. We
refer to cases that appear in the literature.
  We use this basic idea of extending modules to explain, in a more rigorous
way, the so-called {\it covering technique}, which is needed when using {\it
Sweedler notations} for coproducts and coactions. Again, we give many examples
and refer to the existing literature where this technique is applied.

species of vinyl cyanide have been studied in natural abundances between 64 and
351 GHz. In combination with previous results, greatly improved spectroscopic
parameters have been obtained which in turn helped to identify transitions of
the $^{13}$C species for the first time in space through a molecular line
survey of the extremely line-rich interstellar source Sagittarius B2(N) in the
3 mm region with some additional observations at 2 mm. The $^{13}$C species are
detected in two compact ($\sim 2.3''$), hot (170 K) cores with a column density
of $\sim 3.8 \times 10^{16}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively.
In the main source, the so-called ``Large Molecule Heimat'', we derive an
abundance of $2.9 \times 10^{-9}$ for each $^{13}$C species relative to H$_2$.
An isotopic ratio $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C of 21 has been measured. Based on a
comparison to the column densities measured for the $^{13}$C species of ethyl
cyanide also detected in this survey, it is suggested that the two hot cores of
Sgr B2(N) are in different evolutionary stages. Supplementary laboratory data
for the main isotopic species recorded between 92 and 342 GHz permitted an
improvement of its spectroscopic parameters as well.

q-query locally decodable quantum code encodes n classical bits in an m-qubit
state, in such a way that each of the encoded bits can be recovered with high
probability by a measurement on at most q qubits of the quantum code, even if a
constant fraction of its qubits have been corrupted adversarially. We show that
such a quantum code can be transformed into a classical q-query locally
decodable code of the same length that can be decoded well on average (albeit
with smaller success probability and noise-tolerance). This shows, roughly
speaking, that q-query quantum codes are not significantly better than q-query
classical codes, at least for constant or small q.

that the sharp anomaly at about 150 K and the low temperature upturn of
resistivity are suppressed by doping holes into the parent phase. Interestingly
both the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lattice constants
(a-axis and c-axis) increase monotonously with hole concentration, in sharp
contrast with the electron doped side where the $T_c$ increases with a
continuing shrinkage of the lattice constants either by dope more fluorine or
oxygen vacancies into the system. Our data clearly illustrate that the
superconductivity can be induced by doping holes via substituting the trivalent
La with divalent Sr in the LaFeAsO system with single FeAs layer, and the $T_c$
in the present system exhibits a symmetric behavior at the electron and hole
doped sides, as we reported previously.

  From this analysis, clear and insightful pictures of the physics involved in
this kind of processes are obtained, which are of general validity (i.e.,
regardless of the type of wave packets considered) in the understanding of more
complex cases where interference is crucial (e.g., scattering problems, slit
diffraction, quantum control scenarios or, even, multipartite interactions). In
particular, we show how problems involving wave-packet interference can be
mapped onto problems of wave packets scattered off potential barriers.

case of diversity-induced reseonance: that of a system of globally-coupled
linear oscillators subjected to a periodic forcing. Diversity appears as the
parameters characterizing each oscillator, namely its mass, internal frequency
and damping coefficient are drawn from a probability distribution. The main
ingredients for the diversity-induced-resonance phenomenon are present in this
system as the oscillators display a variability in the individual responses but
are induced, by the coupling, to synchronize their responses. A steady state
solution for this model is obtained. We also determine the conditions under
which it is possible to find a resonance effect.
