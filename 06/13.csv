spacetimes using approximate methods. Black rings in AdS exist with arbitrarily
large radius and satisfy a bound |J| \leq LM, which they saturate as their
radius becomes infinitely large. For angular momentum near the maximum, they
have larger area than rotating AdS black holes. Thin black rings also exist in
deSitter space, with rotation velocities varying between zero and a maximum,
and with a radius that is always strictly below the Hubble radius. Our general
analysis allows us to include black Saturns as well, which we discuss briefly.
We present a simple physical argument why supersymmetric AdS black rings must
not be expected: they do not possess the necessary pressure to balance the AdS
potential. We discuss the possible existence or absence of `large AdS black
rings' and their implications for a dual hydrodynamic description. An analysis
of the physical properties of rotating AdS black holes is also included.

  Our main result is a variant of spectral partitioning, which can be
implemented in nearly linear time. Given a graph in which the Max Cut optimum
is a $1-\epsilon$ fraction of edges, our spectral partitioning algorithm finds
a set $S$ of vertices and a bipartition $L,R=S-L$ of $S$ such that at least a
$1-O(\sqrt \epsilon)$ fraction of the edges incident on $S$ have one endpoint

Iterating this procedure yields the approximation results stated above.

wavelength RMS. We propose a novel method based on a pre-optics setup that
behaves partly as a low-efficiency coronagraph, and partly as a
high-sensitivity wavefront aberration compensator (phase and amplitude). The
combination of the two effects results in a highly accurate corrected
wavefront. First, an (intensity-) unbalanced nulling interferometer (UNI)
performs a rejection of part of the wavefront electric field. Then the
recombined output wavefront has its input aberrations magnified. Because of the
unbalanced recombination scheme, aberrations can be free of phase singular
points (zeros) and can therefore be compensated by a downstream phase and
amplitude correction (PAC) adaptive optics system, using two deformable
mirrors. In the image plane, the central star's peak intensity and the noise
level of its speckled halo are reduced by the UNI-PAC combination: the
output-corrected wavefront aberrations can be interpreted as an improved
compensation of the initial (eventually already corrected) incident wavefront
aberrations. The important conclusion is that not all the elements in the
optical setup using UNI-PAC need to reach the lambda/10000 rms surface error
quality.

time at many sites (origins) along the chromosome. Stochastic initiation
implies fluctuations in the time to complete and may lead to cell death if
replication takes longer than the cell cycle time ($\approx 25$ min).
Surprisingly, although the typical replication time is about 20 min, \textit{in
vivo} experiments show that replication fails to complete only about 1 in 300
times. How is replication timing accurately controlled despite the
stochasticity? Biologists have proposed two solutions to this

but increases their rate of initiation as S phase proceeds, while the second
uses regularly spaced origins. In this paper, we investigate the
random-completion problem using a type of model first developed to describe the
kinetics of first-order phase transitions. Using methods from the field of
extreme-value statistics, we derive the distribution of replication-completion
times for a finite genome. We then argue that the biologists' first solution to
the problem is not only consistent with experiment but also nearly optimizes
the use of replicative proteins. We also show that spatial regularity in origin
placement does not alter significantly the distribution of replication times
and, thus, is not needed for the control of replication timing.

which vortices and anti-vortices coexist is investigated theoretically in thin
superconducting films with nanostructured defects. A simple London model is
proposed for the vortex dynamics in films with periodic arrays of nanomagnets
or cylindrical holes (antidots). Common to these films is that vortex
anti-vortex pairs may be created in the vicinity of the defects by relatively
small transport currents, because it adds to the current generated by the
defects - the nanomagnets screening current, or the antidots backflow current -
and may exceed locally the critical value for vortex anti-vortex pair creation.
The model assumes that vortex matter dynamics is governed by Langevin
equations, modified to account for creation and annihilation of vortex
anti-vortex pairs. For pair creation, it is assumed that whenever the total
current at some location exceeds a critical value, equal to that needed to
separate a vortex from an anti-vortex by a vortex core diameter, a pair is
created instantaneously around this location. Pair annihilation occurs by
vortex anti-vortex collisions. The model is applied to films at zero external
magnetic field and low temperatures. It is found that several moving vortex
matter steady-states with equal numbers of vortices and anti-vortices are
possible.

is whether or not these variations are also present in the bulk, and how they
influence superconducting properties. As many theories and data analyses for

magnetoelectric multiferroics, in which both types of order are simultaneously

\cite{fennie} presents an analysis of the important ``ABO$_3$'' class of
perovskite multiferroics. This Letter argues that antiferromagnetic
multiferroics with magnetic ions on the B site, such as the well-studied
room-temperature multiferroic bismuth ferrite (A=Bi, B=Fe), cannot show linear
magnetoelectric coupling of the form ${\bf P} \cdot ({\bf L} \times {\bf M})$.
Here ${\bf P}$ is polarization and ${\bf L}$ and ${\bf M}$ are
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic moments. The conclusion of Ref.
\onlinecite{fennie} is that only materials with magnetic A-site have this

in the ABO$_3$ multiferroics. We show that the argument of Ref.
\onlinecite{fennie} does forbid $E_{PLM}$ if the final low-symmetry phase
contains only one distortion that, like ${\bf P}$, breaks all inversion
symmetries. In reality, there are multiple distortions in this symmetry class,

at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths appear in the region of the IRAC
colour-colour diagrams previously identified as the domain of luminous active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our analysis using a set of empirical and theoretical
dusty starburst spectral energy distribution (SED) models shows that power-law
continuum sources associated with hot dust heated by young (<100 Myr old),
extreme starbursts at z>2 also occupy the same general area as AGNs in the IRAC
colour-colour plots. A detailed comparison of the IRAC colours and SEDs
demonstrates that the two populations are distinct from each other, with
submillimetre-bright galaxies having a systematically flatter IRAC spectrum (>1
mag bluer in the observed [4.5]-[8.0] colour). Only about 20% of the objects
overlap in the colour-colour plots, and this low fraction suggests that
submillimetre galaxies powered by a dust-obscured AGN are not common. The red
IR colours of the submillimetre galaxies are distinct from those of the
ubiquitous foreground IRAC sources, and we propose a set of IR colour selection
criteria for identifying SMG counterparts that can be used even in the absence
of radio or Spitzer MIPS 24 micron data.

and lack of precise quantum control is a central challenge that must be
overcome if a large robust quantum computer is to be constructed. The
traditional approach to achieving this is via active quantum error correction
using fault-tolerant techniques. An alternative to this approach is to engineer
strongly interacting many-body quantum systems that enact the quantum error
correction via the natural dynamics of these systems. Here we present a method
for achieving this based on the concept of concatenated quantum error
correcting codes. We define a class of Hamiltonians whose ground states are
concatenated quantum codes and whose energy landscape naturally causes quantum
error correction. We analyze these Hamiltonians for robustness and suggest
methods for implementing these highly unnatural Hamiltonians.

log plot, and the time plot. The main conclusions of this work are: a) The
comet shows activity at perihelion and aphelion, caused by two different active
areas: Source 1, close to the South pole, active at perihelion, and Source 2,
at the North pole, centered at aphelion. b) More than 18 physical parameters
are measured from the secular light curves, many of them new, and are listed in
the individual plots of the comet. Specifically we find for Source 1 the
location of the turn on and turn off points of activity, RON= -1.63+-0.03 AU,
ROFF= +1.49+-0.20 AU, TON= -87+-5 d, TOFF= +94+-15 d, the time lag, LAG(q)=
6+-1 d, the total active time, TACTIVITY= 181+-16 d, and the amplitude of the
secular light curve, ASEC(1,1) = 4.8+-0.1 mag. c) From this information the
photometric age and the time-age defined in Ferrin (Icarus 178, 493-516, 2005a,
and Icarus, 185, 523-543, 2006), can be calculated, and we find P-AGE=97+-8
comet years and T-AGE= 103+-9 comet years (cy). Thus comet 2P/Encke is an old
comet entering the methuselah stage (100 cy < age). d) The activity at aphelion
(Source 2), extends for TACTIVITY = 815+-30 d and the amplitude of the secular
light curve is ASEC (1,Q) = 3.0+-0.2 mag. e) From a new phase diagram an
absolute magnitude and phase coefficient for the nucleus are determined, and we
find RNUC(1,1,0)= 15.05+-0.14, and betha= 0.066+-0.003. From this data we find
a nucleus effective diameter DEFFE = 5.12(+2.5;-1.7) km. These values are not
much different from previous determinations but exhibit smaller errors.

O9.7 supergiant zeta Ori A, using spectropolarimetric observations obtained
with NARVAL at the 2m Telescope Bernard Lyot atop Pic du Midi (France). zeta
Ori A is the third O star known to host a magnetic field (along with theta^1
Ori C and HD 191612), and the first detection on a 'normal' rapidly-rotating O
star. The magnetic field of zeta Ori A is the weakest magnetic field ever
detected on a massive star. The measured field is lower than the thermal
equipartition limit (about 100 G). By fitting NLTE model atmospheres to our
spectra, we determined that zeta Ori A is a 40 Msun star with a radius of 25
Rsun and an age of about 5 - 6 Myr, showing no surface nitrogen enhancement and
losing mass at a rate of about 2x10^(-6) Msol/yr. The magnetic topology of zeta
Ori A is apparently more complex than a dipole and involves two main magnetic
polarities located on both sides of the same hemisphere; our data also suggest
that zeta Ori A rotates in about 7.0 d and is about 40 degrees away from
pole-on to an Earth-based observer. Despite its weakness, the detected magnetic
field significantly affects the wind structure; the corresponding Alfven radius
is however very close to the surface, thus generating a different rotational
modulation in wind lines than that reported on the two other known magnetic O
stars. The rapid rotation of zeta Ori A with respect to theta^1 Ori C appears
as a surprise, both stars having similar unsigned magnetic fluxes (once
rescaled to the same radius); it may suggest that the sub-equipartition field
detected on zeta Ori A is not a fossil remnant (as opposed to that of theta^1
Ori C and HD 191612), but the result of an exotic dynamo action produced
through MHD instabilities.

issues, the non-zero spin current in the equilibrium case, the non-conserved
spin current, and the violation of the Onsager relation, are intrinsic
properties of spin transport. We note that the conventional definition of the
spin current has very clear physical intuition and describes the spin motion
very well. Therefore we feel that the conventional definition of the spin
current makes physical sense and there is no need to modify it. In addition,
the relationship between the persistent spin current and transport spin
current, the persistent linear and angular spin currents in the SOI region of
the hybrid ring, are discussed. Finally, we show that if the spin-spin
interaction is included into the Hamiltonian, the persistent spin current is
automatically conserved using the conventional definition.

modifier gene models, in which a neutral gene is posited to control the

has found the manifestations of an ""evolutionary reduction principle"": in a
population near equilibrium, a new modifier allele that scales equally all
transition probabilities between different genotypes under selection can invade
if and only if it reduces the transition probabilities. Analytical results on
the reduction principle have always required some set of constraints for
tractability: limitations to one or two selected loci, two alleles per locus,
specific selection regimes or weak selection, specific genetic processes being
modified, extreme or infinitesimal effects of the modifier allele, or tight
linkage between modifier and selected loci. Here, I prove the reduction
principle in the absence of any of these constraints, confirming a twenty-year

spectacular degree of accuracy. However, from the very early days it has been
known that, in QED, there are two important problems which are linked with the
very foundation of the theory. In 1952, Dyson put forward strong argumnts to
suggest that the perturbation seires in quantum electrodynamics can not be
convergent. Just three years latter, in 1955, Landau argued that the effective
running coupling constant in QED has a pole (Landau singularity) albeit at some
very high energy scale. This paper addresses, in details, the question of
stability of perturbative vacuum state of QED in the light of these two well
known problems.

spectral energy distributions are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they
show a prominent 1.6micron bump thus minimizing the AGN emission contamination.
This AGN population comprises approximately 50% of the X-ray selected AGN at
these redshifts. AGN reside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts
probed here, with characteristic stellar masses that are intermediate between
those of local type 2 AGN and high redshift (z~2) AGN. The inferred black hole
masses of typical AGN are similar to those of optically identified quasars at
similar redshifts. Since the AGN in our sample are much less luminous than
quasars, typical AGN have low Eddington ratios. This suggests that, at least at
intermediate redshifts, the cosmic AGN 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease
in the characteristic stellar mass of the host galaxies, and less efficient
accretion. Finally there is no strong evidence in AGN host galaxies for either
highly suppressed star formation, expected if AGN played a role in quenching
star formation, or elevated star formation when compared to mass selected

simulations of the nonlinear field theory are difficult to perform in
(3+1)-dimensions, due to the existence of multiple length and time scales. In
this paper we study a (2+1)-dimensional analogue of cosmic vortons, which we
refer to as kinky vortons, where the cosmic string is replaced by a kink
string. Many of the expected qualitative aspects of cosmic vortons transfer to
kinky vortons, with the advantage that several approximations used in the study
of cosmic vortons can be replaced by exact results. Furthermore, the numerical
study of kinky vortons requires less computational resources than cosmic
vortons, so a number of issues can be addressed in some depth. The radius of
the kinky vorton is determined as a function of the charge and winding number,
and it is shown that the chiral limit is a repulsive fixed point. Stability to
both axial and non-axial perturbations is demonstrated in the electric and
chiral regimes, though surprisingly long lived ringing modes are observed.
Kinky vortons which are too magnetic are shown to suffer from a pinching
instability, which results in a reduction in the winding number and can convert
magnetic into electric solutions.

consider Hubbard model which includes only on-site repulsion U. We find that
the increase of interchain coupling enhances superconducting susceptibility,
although it deforms the nested Fermi surface and suppresses the spin
susceptibility. Next we consider an extended Hubbard model which includes
nearest-neighbor repulsion V . In this case we consider the competition between
different symmetries of electron pairing, d_{x^2-y^2} - and d_xy-wave symmetry,
and find that the particle-particle interaction vertex for d_{x^2-y^2}-wave
pairing is no longer attractive even in the region where nesting condition
still holds. On the other hand, the interaction vertex for d_xy-wave pairing
persists to be attractive. The obtained results for the Hubbard model show
qualitative agreement with recent renormalization group study, and have the

is to replace this static point of view on the genealogies by an analysis of

martingale problems to construct the tree-valued resampling dynamics of the
evolving genealogies for both the finite population Moran model and the
infinite population Fleming-Viot diffusion. We show that sufficient information

give explicit formulas for the evolution of the Laplace transform of the

Their evolution is determined by the orbital angular momentum loss and/or
nuclear evolution of the donors. All observed semidetached LMBHB are observed
as soft X-ray transients (SXTs). The absence of observed short-period stable
luminous X-ray sources with black holes and low-mass optical components
suggests that upon RLOF by the donor, the angular-momentum losses are
substantially reduced. The model with reduced angular-momentum loss reasonably
well reproduces the masses and effective temperatures of the observed
secondaries of SXTs. Theoretical mass-transfer rates in SXTs are consistent
with those deduced from observations only if the accretion discs in LMBHB are
truncated. The population of short-period LMBHB is formed mainly by systems
which at RLOF had unevolved or slightly evolved donors (abundance of hydrogen
in the center $> 0.35$). Our models suggest that a very high efficiency of
common envelopes ejection is necessary to form LMBHB.

  The TALYS predictions for the thermonuclear rates of relevance to

significantly from those of previous codes, in particular for nuclei for which

influence the astrophysics rates of exotic neutron-rich nuclei significantly.

\textit{unpolarized} particles, with emphasis placed on energy or speed of the
underlying particles involved in the process. An explicit expression is derived
for the corresponding transition probabilities in closed form to the leading
order. These expressions are unlike the ones obtained from simply combining
spins of the relevant particles which are of kinematic nature. It is remarkable
that these explicit results obtained from quantum field theory show a clear

spin-wave excitations and $\Z_2$ vortices. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations
show that the T=0 chiral order disappears at finite temperature in a continuous
phase transition in the 2D Ising universality class, despite misleading
intermediate-size effects observed at the transition. The analysis of
configurations reveals that short-range spin fluctuations and $\Z_2$ vortices
proliferate near the chiral domain walls explaining the strong renormalization
of the transition temperature. Chiral domain walls can themselves carry an
unlocalized $\Z_2$ topological charge, and vortices are then preferentially
paired with charged walls. Further, we conjecture that the anomalous
size-effects suggest the proximity of the present model to a tricritical point.

transitions obtained by Monte Carlo simulations on several related models (ii)

three-dimensional excitable media. Cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction are examples of such media. In cardiac tissue, chaotic behaviour is
believed to underlie fibrillation which, without intervention, precedes cardiac
death. In this study we investigate suppression of the turbulence using
stimulation of two different types, ""modulation of excitability"" and ""extra
transmembrane current"". With cardiac defibrillation in mind, we used a single
pulse as well as repetitive extra current with both constant and feedback
controlled frequency. We show that turbulence can be terminated using either a
resonant modulation of excitability or a resonant extra current. The turbulence
is terminated with much higher probability using a resonant frequency
perturbation than a non-resonant one. Suppression of the turbulence using a
resonant frequency is up to fifty times faster than using a non-resonant
frequency, in both the modulation of excitability and the extra current modes.
We also demonstrate that resonant perturbation requires strength one order of
magnitude lower than that of a single pulse, which is currently used in
clinical practice to terminate cardiac fibrillation. Our results provide a
robust method of controlling complex chaotic spatio-temporal processes.
Resonant drift of spiral waves has been studied extensively in two dimensions,
however, these results show for the first time that it also works in three
dimensions, despite the complex nature of the scroll wave turbulence.

diffractive photoproduction of dijets have appeared, we have recalculated these
cross sections in next-to-leading order (NLO) of perturbative QCD to see
whether they can be interpreted consistently. The results of these calculations
are compared to the data of both collaborations. We find that at NLO the cross
sections disagree with the data, showing that factorization breaking occurs at
this order. If direct and resolved contributions are both suppressed by the
same amount, the global suppression factor depends on the transverse-energy cut
and is 0.42 for the H1 and 0.71 for the ZEUS analysis. However, by suppressing
only the resolved contribution by a factor of approximately three, also
reasonably good agreement with all the data is found. The size of the
factorization breaking effects for resolved photons agrees with
absorptive-model predictions.

spinning rings inside a cryostat. Below a critical temperature (typically <30
K), the gyroscopes measure a significant deviation from their usual offset due
to Earth's rotation. This deviation is proportional to the applied angular ring
velocity with maximum signals towards lower temperatures. The anomalous
gyroscope signal is about 8 orders of magnitude smaller then the applied
angular ring velocity, compensating about one third of the Earth rotation
offset at an angular top speed of 420 rad/s. Moreover, our data shows a parity
violation as the effect appears to be dominant for rotation against the Earth's
spin. No systematic effect was found to explain this effect including the
magnetic environment, vibration and helium gas friction suggesting that our
observation is a new low temperature phenomenon. Tests in various
configurations suggest that the rotating low temperature helium may be the
source of our anomalous signals.

are studied in a light-cone description of the nucleon where the Fock expansion

derived in terms of the six amplitudes needed to describe the three-quark

T-even TMDs are presented in a light-cone constituent quark model, and the role
of the so-called pretzelosity is investigated to produce a nonspherical shape
