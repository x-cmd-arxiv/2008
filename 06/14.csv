catalogs. We observe for the first time an increase in the fraction of cluster
galaxies with mid-infrared star formation rates higher than 4 solar masses per
year from 3% at z=0.02 to 13% at z=0.83. This increase is reproduced even when
considering only the most massive members (Mstars >4x10^10 Msun). The 24 micron
observations reveal stronger evolution in the fraction of blue/star-forming
cluster galaxies than color-selected samples: the number of red but strongly
star-forming cluster galaxies increases with redshift, and combining these with
the optically-defined Butcher-Oemler members increases the total fraction of
blue/star-forming cluster galaxies to ~30% at z=0.83. These results, the first
of our Spitzer/MIPS Infra-Red Cluster Survey (SMIRCS), support earlier studies
indicating the increase in star-forming members is driven by cluster assembly
and galaxy infall, as is expected in the framework of hierarchical formation.

Galform code. Although the model successfully reproduces the observed total
mass function and the general trend of downsizing, it fails to accurately
reproduce the colour distribution and type-dependent mass functions at all
redshifts probed. This failure is shared by other semi-analytical models which
collectively appear to ""over-quench"" star formation in intermediate-mass
systems. These mock lightcones are also a valuable tool for investigating the
reliability of the observational results in terms of cosmic variance. Using
variance estimates derived from the lightcones we confirm the significance of
the decline since z=1 in the observed number density of massive blue galaxies

  We obtained four observations spaced in rotational phase with XMM-Newton and
with Chandra. A detailed analysis of the data was performed to derive both
photometric and spectral parameters from the EPIC data, searching for
rotational modulation, and to derive the location of the X-ray plasma from the

  The strong rotational modulation predicted by the early, static magnetically
confined wind model for the X-ray emission is not observed in Beta Cep. The
small modulation present goes in the opposite direction, pointing to the
absence of any optically thick disk of neutral material, and showing a
modulation consistent with the later, dynamic models of magnetically confined
wind models in B stars. The lack of observed bulk motion points to the plasma
being confined by a magnetic field, but the low plasma temperature and lack of
any flaring show that the plasma is not heated by magnetic reconnection.
Therefore, the observations point to X-ray emission from shocks in a
magnetically confined wind, with no evidence of an optically thick, dense disk

BD+30 3639 for a total of 300 ks with the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Low
Energy Transmission Gratings in combination with its Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer(LETG/ACIS-S). The LETG/ACIS-S spectrum of BD+30 3639 is dominated
by H-like resonance lines of O viii and C sc vi and the He-like triplet line
complexes of Ne ix and O vii. Other H-like resonance lines, such as N vii, as
well as lines of highly ionized Fe, are weak or absent. Continuum emission is
evident over the range 6-18 A. Spectral modeling indicates the presence of a
range of plasma temperatures from T~1.7x10^6 K to 2.9x10^6 K and an intervening
absorbing column N_H~2.4x10^21 cm-2. The same modeling conclusively
demonstrates that C and Ne are highly enhanced, with abundance ratios of
C/O~15-45 and Ne/O~3.3-5.0 (90% confidence ranges, relative to the solar
ratios), while N and Fe are depleted, N/O~0.0-1.0 and Fe/O~0.1-0.4. The
intrinsic luminosity of the X-ray source determined from the modeling and the
measured flux (F_X = 4.1x10^-13 ergs cm-2 s-1) is L_X~8.6x10^32 erg

consistent with earlier results obtained from X-ray CCD imaging spectroscopy of

estimating C_H(G). Previous results cover only a few specific instances of this
general problem, for example, the case when H has degree at most one
(monomer-dimer problem). In this paper, we present the first general subcase of
the subgraph isomorphism counting problem which is almost always efficiently
approximable. The results rely on a new graph decomposition technique.
Informally, the decomposition is a labeling of the vertices such that every
edge is between vertices with different labels and for every vertex all
neighbors with a higher label have identical labels. The labeling implicitly
generates a sequence of bipartite graphs which permits us to break the problem
of counting embeddings of large subgraphs into that of counting embeddings of
small subgraphs. Using this method, we present a simple randomized algorithm
for the counting problem. For all decomposable graphs H and all graphs G, the
algorithm is an unbiased estimator. Furthermore, for all graphs H having a
decomposition where each of the bipartite graphs generated is small and almost
all graphs G, the algorithm is a fully polynomial randomized approximation
scheme.
  We show that the graph classes of H for which we obtain a fully polynomial
randomized approximation scheme for almost all G includes graphs of degree at
most two, bounded-degree forests, bounded-length grid graphs, subdivision of
bounded-degree graphs, and major subclasses of outerplanar graphs,
series-parallel graphs and planar graphs, whereas unbounded-length grid graphs

address the issues of the evolution of oxygen and neon in the interstellar
medium (ISM) and in the late evolutionary phases of low- and intermediate-mass
stars (LIMS), as well as the currently hotly disputed solar Ne/O abundance
ratio. Through the comparisons, we find that neon abundance and Ne/O ratio
increase with increasing oxygen abundance in both types of nebulae, with
positive correlation coefficients larger than 0.75. The correlations suggest
different enrichment mechanisms for oxygen and neon in the ISM, in the sense
that the growth of neon is delayed compared to oxygen. The differences of
abundances between PNe and HII regions, are mainly attributed to the results of
nucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes that occurred in the progenitor stars
of PNe. We find that both these alpha-elements are significantly enriched at
low metallicity (initial oxygen abundance <= 8.0) but not at metallicity higher
than the SMC. The fact that Ne/O ratios measured in PNe are almost the same as
those in HII regions, regardless of the metallicity, suggests a very similar
production mechanism of neon and oxygen in intermediate mass stars (IMS) of low
initial metallicities and in more massive stars, a conjecture that requires
verification by further theoretical studies. This result also strongly suggests
that both the solar neon abundance and the Ne/O ratio should be revised upwards
by ~0.22 dex from the Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval values or by ~0.14 dex from
the Grevesse & Sauval values.

The main contenders are lattice vibrations (phonons) and spin-excitations with
the additional possibility of pairing without mediators. In conventional
superconductors, phonon-mediated pairing was unequivocally established by data
from tunnelling experiments. Proponents of phonons as the high-T c glue were
therefore encouraged by the recent scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments
on hole-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-delta (BSCCO) that reveal an oxygen lattice
vibrational mode whose energy is anticorrelated with the superconducting gap
energy scale. Here we report high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy

in PLCCO measured by inelastic neutron scattering (resonance mode) and a
low-energy acoustic phonon mode, but differs substantially from the oxygen
vibrational mode identified in BSCCO. Our analysis of the variation of the
local mode energy and intensity with the local gap energy scale indicates an
electronic origin of the mode consistent with spin-excitations rather than

using an electric current via the spin transfer effect. Time domain
measurements of nanopillar devices at low temperatures have directly shown that
magnetization dynamics and reversal occur coherently over a timescale of
nanoseconds. By adjusting the shape of a spin torque waveform over a timescale
comparable to the free precession period (100-400 ps), control of the
magnetization dynamics in nanopillar devices should be possible. Here we report
coherent control of the free layer magnetization in nanopillar devices using a
pair of current pulses as narrow as 30 ps with adjustable amplitudes and delay.
We show that the switching probability can be tuned over a broad range by
timing the current pulses with the underlying free-precession orbits, and that
the magnetization evolution remains coherent for more than 1 ns even at room
temperature. Furthermore, we can selectively induce transitions along
free-precession orbits and thereby manipulate the free magnetic moment motion.
We expect this technique will be adopted for further elucidating the dynamics
and dissipation processes in nanomagnets, and will provide an alternative for
spin torque driven spintronic devices, such as resonantly pumping microwave
oscillators, and ultimately, for efficient reversal of memory bits in magnetic
random access memory (MRAM).

The evolving stabilised shapes of histograms follow the rule that all are
either double- or triple-peaked. Moreover, at most one peak can be on the
central bins 2,...,9 and the distribution in these bins looks smooth
`Gaussian-like' while changes at the extremes (1 and 10) often look abrupt. It
is shown that this is well approximated under the assumption that histograms
are confined and discretised probability density functions of L\'evy skew
alpha-stable distributions. These distributions are the only stable
distributions which could emerge due to a generalized central limit theorem
from averaging of various independent random avriables as which one can see the
initial opinions of users. Averaging is also an appropriate assumption about
the social process which underlies the process of continuous opinion formation.
Surprisingly, not the normal distribution achieves the best fit over histograms
obseved on the web, but distributions with fat tails which decay as power-laws
with exponent -(1+alpha) (alpha=4/3). The scale and skewness parameters of the
Levy skew alpha-stable distributions seem to depend on the deviation from an
average movie (with mean about 7.6). The histogram of such an average movie has

formation of stars. However, in recent years, non-thermal radiation from
massive star forming regions has been detected.
  Synchrotron radio emission and non-thermal X-rays from the outflows of
massive young stellar objects (YSOs) provide evidence of the presence of
relativistic particles in these sources.
  In YSOs, the acceleration of particles is likely produced where the thermal
jet impacts on the surrounding medium and a shock wave is formed. Thus,
particles might be accelerated up to relativistic energies through a Fermi-I
type mechanism.
  Relativistic electrons and protons can interact with thermal particles and
photons, producing then gamma-rays. These energetic photons could be detected
by the new generation of instruments, making massive YSOs a new population of
gamma-ray surces.
  In the present contribution we briefly describe some massive star forming
regions from which non-thermal radio emission has been detected.
  In addition, we present a general model for high-energy radiation from the
massive YSOs embedded in these regions. We take into account both leptonic and
hadronic interactions of particles accelerated at the termination points of the
collimated outflows ejected from the protostar.

map, allowing us to estimate the mass in a localized disk+envelope around it to
be in the range of 0.001 to 0.01Ms. Thus IRAS04325C is unlikely to accrete
significantly more mass. The near-infrared spectrum cannot be explained with an
extincted photosphere alone, but is consistent with a 0.03-0.1Ms central source
plus moderate veiling, seen in scattered light, confirming the edge-on nature
of the disk. Based on K-band flux and spectral slope we conclude that a central
object mass >~0.1Ms is unlikely. Our comparison of the full spectral energy
distribution, including new Spitzer photometry, with radiative transfer models
confirms the high inclination of the disk (>~80deg), the very low mass of the
central source, and the small amount of circumstellar material. IRAS04325C is
one of the lowest mass objects with a resolved edge-on disk known to date,

similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray emitting gas
from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the
distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and
weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing
analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy
confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution
in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4sigma significance) from the
peak of the hot X-ray emitting gas (the main baryonic component), but aligned

those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor

of cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. Cusp
elliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting on
stars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipational
starbursts. Core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)
cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve a
compact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).
Comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how to
observationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. We
demonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation in
the initial gas-rich merger(s). The typical degree of dissipation is a strong
function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. We find a
correlation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with more
dissipation are more compact. The survival of this component and scattering of
stars into the envelope naturally explain high-Sersic index profiles
characteristic of massive core ellipticals. This is also closely related to the
kinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst components
from their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/core
ellipticals. We show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profiles
when attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered out
of the inner regions by binary black holes. Estimates of scoured mass ignoring
multi-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explaining

the LSP can be a well-tempered neutralino. We demonstrate explicitly that
competitive gauge-mediated terms can naturally appear within phenomenological

singlet field which is responsible for the masses of the messenger fields. For
viable stabilization mechanisms, the relation between the gauge and anomaly

mediation, despite the presence of the Kahler modulus. Turning to TeV scale

pass remarkably close to the galactic center. LSR1425+71 has a luminosity and
colors consistent with its metal-poor subdwarf spectral classification, while
LSR1610-00 has a luminosity and most colors indicative of being only mildly

ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group constitute the fossil
relic of a once ubiquitous population of dwarf galaxies formed before
reionization with circular velocities smaller than $v_{c}^{cr} \sim 20$ km/s.
We present several arguments in support of this model. The number of luminous
Milky Way satellites inferred from observations is larger than the estimated
number of dark halos in the Galaxy that have, or had in the past, circular
velocity $>v_{c}^{cr}$, as predicted by the ""Via Lactea"" simulation. This
implies that some ultra-faint dwarfs are fossils. However, this argument is
weakened by recent results from the ""Aquarius"" simulations showing that the
number of Galactic dark matter satellites is 2.5 larger than previously
believed. Secondly, the existence of a population of ultra-faint dwarfs was
predicted by cosmological simulations in which star formation in the first
minihalos is reduced -- but not suppressed -- by radiative feedback. Here, we
show the statistical properties of the fossil galaxies in those simulations are
consistent with observations of the new dwarf population and with the number
and radial distribution of Milky Way satellites as a function of their
luminosity. Finally, the observed Galactocentric distribution of dwarfs is
consistent with a fraction of dSphs being fossils. To make our case more
compelling, future work should determine whether stellar chemical abundances of
simulated ""fossils"" can reproduce observations and whether the tidal scenarios
for the formation of Local Group dwarf spheroidals are equally consistent with
all available observations.

SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) >> 1, indicative of star formation highly obscured by
dust. We focus on the substantial minority of A851 cluster members where strong
Balmer absorption points to a starburst on a 10^{8-9} year timescale. As is
typical, A851 galaxies with strong Balmer absorption occur in two types: with
optical emission (starforming), and without (post-starburst). Our principal
result is the former, so-called e(a) galaxies, are mostly detected (9 out of
12) at 24 um -- for these we find typically SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 4. Strong
Balmer absorption and high values of SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) both indicate
moderately active starbursts and support the picture that e(a) galaxies are the
active starbursts that feed the post-starburst population. While 24 um
detections are frequent with Balmer-strong objects (even 6 out of 18 of the
supposedly ""post-starburst'' galaxies are detected) only 2 out of 7 of the
continuously starforming `e(c)' galaxies (with weak Balmer absorption) are
detected -- for them, SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 1. Their optical spectra
resemble present-epoch spirals that dominate today's universe; we strengthen
this association by that SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 1 is the norm today. That is,
not just the amount of star formation, but its mode, has evolved strongly from
z ~ 0.4 to the present. By fitting spectrophotometric models we measure the
strength and duration of the bursts to quantify the evolutionary sequence from
active- to post-starburst, and to harden the evidence that moderately active
starbursts are the defining feature of starforming cluster galaxies at z ~ 0.4.

high-resolution X-ray spectra. This indicates that the stellar winds are
strongly clumped. Furthermore, the nearly symmetric shape of X-ray emission
line profiles can be explained if the wind clumps are radially compressed. In
massive binaries the orbital variations of X-ray emission allow to probe the
opacity of the stellar wind; results support the picture of strong wind
clumping. In high-mass X-ray binaries, the stochastic X-ray variability and the
extend of the stellar-wind part photoionized by X-rays provide further strong
evidence that stellar winds consist of dense clumps.

networks (MAHCN) is investigated. We model the two-dimensional plane on which
nodes move randomly with a triangular lattice. Demanding the best communication
of the network, we account the global connectivity $\eta$ as a function of
occupancy $\sigma$ of sites in the lattice by mobile nodes. Critical phenomena
of the connectivity for different transmission ranges $r$ are revealed by
numerical simulations, and these results fit well to the analysis based on the
assumption of homogeneous mixing . Scaling behavior of the connectivity is
found as $\eta \sim f(R^{\beta}\sigma)$, where $R=(r-r_{0})/r_{0}$, $r_{0}$ is
the length unit of the triangular lattice and $\beta$ is the scaling index in
the universal function $f(x)$. The model serves as a sort of site percolation
on dynamic complex networks relative to geometric distance. Moreover, near each
critical $\sigma_c(r)$ corresponding to certain transmission range $r$, there
exists a cut-off degree $k_c$ below which the clustering coefficient of such
self-organized networks keeps a constant while the averaged nearest neighbor
degree exhibits a unique linear variation with the degree k, which may be
useful to the designation of real MAHCN.

definition is given in [1], where an extensive consideration of Stirling
numbers is presented. In this paper an alternative definition of Stirling
numbers of both kind is given. Namely, Stirling numbers of the first kind
appear in the closed formula for the n-th derivative of ln x. In the same way
Stirling numbers of the second kind appear in the formula for the n-th
derivative of f(e^x), where f(x) is an arbitrary smooth real function. This
facts allow us to define Stirling numbers within the frame of differential
calculus. These definitions may be interesting because arbitrary functions
appear in them. Choosing suitable function we may obtain different properties
of Stirling numbers by the use of derivatives only. Using simple properties of
derivatives we obtain here three important properties of Stirling numbers.
First are so called two terms recurrence relations, from which one can easily
derive the combinatorial meaning of Stirling numbers. Next we obtain expansion
formulas of powers into falling factorials, and vise versa. These expansions
usually serve as the definitions of Stirling numbers, as in [1]. Finally, we
obtain the exponential generating functions for Stirling and Bell numbers. As a
by product the closed formulas for the $n$-th derivative of the functions
f(e^x) and f(ln x) are obtained.

life processes, depend on the binding of zinc ion for their proper folding. To
computationally study the zinc coupled folding of the zinc-fingers, charge
transfer and metal induced protonation/deprotonation effects have to be
considered. Here, by attempting to implicitly account for such effects in
classical molecular dynamics and performing intensive simulations with explicit
solvent for the peptides with and without zinc binding, we investigate the
folding of the Cys2His2 type zinc-finger motif and the coupling between the
peptide folding and zinc binding. We find that zinc ion not only stabilizes the
native structure, but also participates in the whole folding process. It binds
to the peptide at early stage of folding, and directs or modulates the folding
and stabilizations of the component beta-hairpin and alpha-helix. Such a
crucial role of zinc binding is mediated by the packing of the conserved
hydrophobic residues. We also find that the packing of the hydrophobic residues
and the coordination of the native ligands are coupled. Meanwhile, the
processes of zinc binding, mis-ligation, ligand exchange and zinc induced
secondary structure conversion, as well as the water behaviour, due to the
involvement of zinc ion are characterized. Our results are in good agreement
with related experimental observations, and provide significant insight into
the general mechanisms of the metal-cofactor dependent protein folding and
other metal induced conformational changes of biological importance.

star with nonvanishing NUT (Newman-Tamburino-Unti) parameter. For the
simplicity of calculations Goldreich-Julian charge density is analyzed for the
aligned neutron star with zero inclination between magnetic field,
gravitomagnetic field and rotation axis. From the system of Maxwell equations
in spacetime of slowly rotating NUT star, second-order differential equation
for electrostatic potential is derived. Analytical solution of this equation
indicates the general relativistic modification of an accelerating electric
field and charge density along the open field lines by the gravitomagnetic
charge. The implication of this effect to the magnetospheric energy loss
problem is underlined. In the second part of the paper we derive the equations
of motion of test particles in magnetosphere of slowly rotating NUT star. Then
we analyze particle motion in the polar cap and show that NUT parameter can
significantly change conditions for particle acceleration.

generalising the theory of the Weierstrass $\wp$-function. We demonstrate that
such functions can give a solution to the KP-equation, outlining how a general

expansion for $\sigma(\bu)$ and a new addition formula.

  Sandip Chakrabarti",,"10.1063/1.3009511",,"astro-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gravitational collapse of a star is an important issue both for general
relativity and astrophysics, which is related to the well known ""frozen star""
paradox. Following the seminal work of Oppenheimer and Schneider (1939), we
present the exact solution for two dust shells collapsing towards a
pre-existing black hole. We find that the inner region of the shell is
influenced by the property of the shell, which is contrary to the result in
Newtonian theory and and the clock inside the shell becomes slower as the shell
collapses towards the pre-existing black hole. This result in principle may be
tested experimentally if a beam of light travels across the shell. We conclude
that the concept of the ""frozen star"" should be abandoned, since matter can
indeed cross a black hole's horizon according to the clock of an external
observer. Since matter will not accumulate around the event horizon of a black
hole, we predict that only gravitational wave radiation can be produced in the
final stage of the merging process of two coalescing black holes. Our results
also indicate that for the clock of an external observer, matter, after
crossing the event horizon, will never arrive at the ""singularity"" (i.e. the
exact center of the black hole.

Fe)Al2O4 spinels from the quasicrystalline phases was investigated with the
variation of process parameters during milling and annealing. The milling of
the quasicrystalline materials was carried out in an attritor mill at 400 rpm
for 40 hours with ball to powder ratio of 40:1 in hexane medium. Subsequently,
annealing was performed in an air ambience for 10, 20, and 40 h at 400, 500,
600 and 700 C in side a furnace in order to oxidize the mechanically milled
quasicrystalline phase for the possible formation of the spinel phase. It was
found that after annealing at higher temperature (500 C), mechanically milled
quasicrystalline alloy transformed to spinel phase whereas annealing at lower
temperature (500 C) it led to the formation of B2 phase as a major one along
with minor amount of oxide phase. The X-ray diffraction and transmission
electron microscopy of the annealed samples confirmed the formation of spinel
phase with an average grain size of 20-40 nm. It is interesting to note that
the nanospinel phases showed the different colors during various annealing time
and temperature. The optical properties of nanospinel materials, investigated
employing UV visible spectrometer exhibited absorption characteristics.
