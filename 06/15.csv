equations appropriate for a perfectly conducting elastic continuous medium
threaded by a uniform magnetic field, the asteroseismic model of a neutron star
undergoing axisymmetric global torsional nodeless vibrations under the combined
action of Hooke's elastic and Lorentz magnetic forces is considered with
emphasis on a toroidal Alfv\'en mode of differentially rotational vibrations
about the dipole magnetic moment axis of the star. The obtained spectral
equation for frequency is applied to $\ell$-pole identification of
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of X-ray flux during the giant flares of SGR
1806-20 and SGR 1900+14. Our calculations suggest that detected QPOs can be
consistently interpreted, within the framework of this model, as produced by
global torsional nodeless vibrations of quaking magnetar if they are considered
to be restored by the joint action of bulk forces of shear elastic and magnetic
field stresses.

arbitrary isolated systems (particles, fields, strings, fluids)admitting a
Lagrangian description is given. The starting point is the parametrized
Minkowski theory describing the system in arbitrary admissible non-inertial
frames in Minkowski space-time, which allows one to define the energy-momentum
tensor of the system and to show the independence of the description from the
clock synchronization convention and from the choice of the 3-coordinates. In
the inertial rest frame the isolated system is seen as a decoupled
non-covariant canonical external center of mass carrying a pole-dipole
structure (the invariant mass $M$ and the rest spin ${\vec {\bar S}}$ of the
system) and an external realization of the Poincare' group. Then an isolated
system of positive-energy charged scalar articles plus an arbitrary
electro-magnetic field in the radiation gauge is investigated as a classical
background for defining relativistic atomic physics. The electric charges of
the particles are Grassmann-valued to regularize the self-energies. The
rest-frame conditions and their gauge-fixings (needed for the elimination of
the internal 3-center of mass) are explicitly given. It is shown that there is
a canonical transformation which allows one to describe the isolated system as
a set of Coulomb-dressed charged particles interacting through a Coulomb plus
Darwin potential plus a free transverse radiation field: these two subsystems
are not mutually interacting and are interconnected only by the rest-frame
conditions and the elimination of the internal 3-center of mass. Therefore in
this framework with a fixed number of particles there is a way out from the
Haag theorem,at least at the classical level.

decays to heavy standard model fermions, they exhibit no light dilepton
resonance. A heavy $Z'$ decaying to v-hadrons, which in turn decay mainly to
bottom quarks and tau leptons, is considered; six case studies are
investigated, using a new Monte Carlo simulation package. It is found that the
one-to-one correspondence of jets and partons is badly broken, and the
high-multiplicity heavy-flavor signal probably cannot be isolated by counting
jets, with or without heavy-flavor tags. Instead, other measures, such as
counting and correlating vertices or displaced tracks, and possibly counting of
(non-isolated) muons and use of event-shape variables, should be combined with
scalar transverse energy and/or missing transverse energy to reduce
backgrounds. Within the resulting sample, searches for the v-pion mass
resonance in both di-jet and single-jet invariant mass can help confirm a
signal. The best observable in a perfect calorimeter seems to be single-jet
invariant mass for jets of larger radius ($R$=0.7), although this needs further
study in a realistic setting. A more detailed signal-to-background study is
needed as a next step, but will face the difficulty of estimating the various

treatment superimposed on a random process reflecting variations in the
efficiency and effectiveness of treatment. The arithmetic mean represents the
net average annual cost of healthcare; and when multiplied by the arithmetic
standard deviation, which represents the effective risk, the result is a
measure of healthcare cost control. Policymakers, providers, payors, or
patients that decrease these parameters are generating value in healthcare. The
model has an average absolute prediction error of approximately 10-12% across
the range of expenditures which spans 6 orders of magnitude over a nearly

representing 20%-30% of total spending on healthcare, a power-law relationship
emerges. This relationship also applies to the most expensive medical

increasing concentration and the decreasing temperature of the intergalactic

and possibly star formation. We expect that pre-reionization fossils that
evolved on the outskirts of the Milky Way or in isolation show a bimodal star
formation history with 12 Gyr old and <10 Gyr old population of stars. Leo T
fits with this scenario. Another prediction of the model is the possible
existence of a population of gas rich minihalos that never formed stars. More
work is needed to understand whether a subset of compact high-velocity clouds
can be identified as such objects or whether an undiscovered population exists
in the voids between galaxies.

sample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebular
lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by
using Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in
these distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the
mass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much stronger
than observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive
galaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star
formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also
indications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger
relative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical
version of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at
z~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical
evolutionary models. Such discrepancies suggest that at z>3 galaxies are
assembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies with
low star formation efficiency. The bulk of the star formation and metallicity
evolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into bigger
systems.

monotone in the weak capillarity case, and become highly oscillatory as the
capillarity strength increases. Using a spectral energy estimate we prove that
small-amplitude monotone shocks are spectrally stable. We also show, through
the use of a novel spectral energy estimate, that monotone shocks have no
unstable real spectrum regardless of amplitude; this implies that any
instabilities of these monotone traveling waves, if they exist, must occur
through a Hopf-like bifurcation, where one or more conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis. We then conduct a systematic numerical
Evans function study, which shows that monotone and mildly oscillatory profiles
in an adiabatic gas are spectrally stable for moderate values of shock and
capillarity strengths. In particular, we show that the transition from monotone
to non-monotone profiles does not appear to trigger any instabilities.

properties only when the different paths the particle may take are
indistinguishable. In a canonical example of a two-path interferometer with a
which-path detector, observation of interference and obtaining which-path
information are mutually exclusive. Such duality has been demonstrated in
optics with a pair of correlated photons and in solid-state devices with
phase-coherent electrons. In the latter case, which-path information was
provided by a charge detector embedded near one path of a two-path electron
interferometer. Note that suppression of interference can always be understood
either as obtaining path information or as unavoidable back action by the
detector. The present study reports on dephasing of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring
interferometer via a coupled charge detector adjacent to the ring. In contrast
to the two-path interferometer, charge detection in the ring does not always
provide path information. Indeed, we found that the interference was suppressed
only when path information could be acquired, even if only in principle. This
demonstrates that dephasing does not always take place by coupling the
`environment' to the interfering particle: path information of the particle
must be available too. Moreover, this is valid regardless of the strength of
environment-interferometer coupling, which refutes the general notion of the
effect of strong interaction with the environment. In other words, it verifies
that an acquisition of which-path information is more fundamental than the
back-action in understanding quantum mechanical complementarity.

in r while for types II and D the r-dependence of the metric as well as of the
Weyl tensor is determined by an integer m corresponding to the rank of the
expansion matrix S_{ij}. It is shown that for non-vanishing expansion, all
these spacetimes contain a curvature singularity.
  As an illustrative example, a shearing expanding type N five-dimensional
vacuum solution is also re-derived using higher-dimensional NP formalism. This
solution can be, however, identified with a direct product of a known
four-dimensional type N metric with an extra dimension.

analysis and the performance of the metrics helps: (a) understand and learn how
well the model runs fits to different combinations of presence and absence of
transitions in a landscape, not simply how well the model fits our given data;
(b) derive (estimate) a theoretical accuracy that we would expect a model to
assess under the presence of incomplete information and measurement; (c)
understand the spatially explicit role and patterns of uncertainty in
simulations and model estimations, by comparing results across simulation runs;
(d) compare the significance or estimation contribution of transitional
presence and absence (change versus no change) to model performance, and the
contribution of the spatial drivers and variables to the explanatory value of
our model; and (e) compare measurements of informational uncertainty at
different scales of spatial resolution.

studied the edge states, focusing on the E=0 edge mode, which is unusual in
that the mode is embedded right within the n=0 bulk Landau level, while usual
QHE edge modes reside across adjacent Landau levels. Here we show that the n=0
Landau level, including the edge mode, has a wave function amplitude
accumulated along zigzag edges whose width scales with the magnetic length,
l_B. This contrasts with the usual QHE where the charge is depleted from the
edge. The implications are: (i) The E=0 edge states in strong magnetic fields
have a topological origin in the honeycomb lattice, so that they are outside
the continuum (""massless Dirac"") model. (ii) The edge-mode contribution decays
only algebraically into the bulk, but this is ""topologically"" compensated by
the bulk contribution, resulting in the accumulation over l_B. (iii) The real

matrix has one degree of freedom that can be described by the azimuthal angle
of a fixed unit vector with respect to the wave vector. This degree of freedom
allows us to find out such a beam solution in which every plane-wave component
is specified by the same fixed unit vector $\mathbf{I}$ and has the same

vector and the propagation axis acts as a parameter that describes the
vectorial property of the beam. The impact of $\theta_I$ is investigated on a
beam of angular-spectrum field scalar that is independent of the azimuthal
angle. The field vector in position space is calculated in the first-order
approximation under the paraxial condition. A transverse effect is found that a
beam of elliptically-polarized angular spectrum is displaced from the center in

depends sensitively on the scattering rate and phase shift of nonmagnetic
impurities. The transition into the superconducting state is always second
order for weak (Born) scattering, while in the unitarity (strong) scattering
limit a first-order transition into both uniform and spatially modulated
superconducting states is stabilized. Contrary to general belief, we find that
the FFLO phase is robust against disorder and survives impurity scattering
equivalent to a $T_c$ suppression of roughly 40%. Our results bear on the
search of FFLO states in heavy-fermion and layered organic superconductors.

primitive is captured logically using a predicate asserting reachability of a

non-trivial programming examples combining higher-order procedures and
dynamically generated local state. Axioms for reachability and local invariant
play a central role for reasoning about the examples.

leads to a backaction of the medium onto the probe field. Counter intuitively,
this pronounced in-medium dynamics throughout the propagation leads to an
additional enhancement of the cavity bandwidth.

analysis by mean of x-ray diffraction shows that the main phase of SmO1-xFxFeAs
was obtained by this synthesis method. The transition temperature of the
SmO0.65F0.35FeAs wires was confirmed to be as high as 52 K. Based on
magnetization measurements, it is found that a globe current can flow on
macroscopic sample dimensions with Jc of ~3.9x10^3 A/cm^2 at 5 K and self
field, while a high Jc about 2x10^5 A/cm^2 is observed within the grains,
suggesting that a significant improvement in the globle Jc is possible. It
should be noted that the Jc exhibits a very weak field dependence behavior.
Furthermore, the upper critical fields (Hc2) determined according to the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula are (T= 0 K) = 120 T, indicating a very
encouraging application of the new superconductors.

The transport in ab plane and along c-axis direction shares the same scattering
mechanism. In contrast to the magnetic behavior of polycrystalline samples, no
Curie-Weiss behavior are observed, a temperature linear dependent
susceptibility occurs above spin-density-wave (SDW) transition. The
susceptibility behavior is very similar to that of antiferromagnetic SDW
chromium. Magnetic behavior of single crystal definitely gives evidence for
existence of local moment except for the contribution to susceptibility from
itinerant electrons. A resistivity minimum strongly dependent on magnetic field
is observed. A log(1/T) divergency, similar to that of the underdoped cuprates,
happens at low temperature. Here we first present intrinsic transport and
magnetic properties, and their anisotropy from high quality single crystal.

ferromagnet realized by means of a random walker. The latter hops across the
sites of the lattice and flips the relevant spins according to a probability
depending on both the local magnetic arrangement and the temperature. The
random walker, intended to model a diffusing excitation, interacts with the
lattice so that it is biased towards those sites where it can achieve an energy
gain. In order to adapt our algorithm to systems made up of arbitrary spins,
some non trivial generalizations are implied. In particular, we will apply the
new dynamics to two-dimensional spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems analyzing their
relaxation and critical behavior. Some interesting differences with respect to
canonical results are found; moreover, by comparing the outcomes from the
examined cases, we will point out their main features, possibly extending the
results to spin-S systems.

multi-TeV emission from a region of the Galactic disk close to the inner
Galaxy. The emission is in excess of what is predicted by conventional models
for cosmic ray propagation, which are tuned to reproduce the spectrum of cosmic
rays observed locally. By assuming that the excess detected by MILAGRO is of
hadronic origin and that it is representative for the whole inner Galactic
region, we estimate the expected diffuse flux of neutrinos from a region of the
Galactic disk with coordinates $-40^{\circ} < l < 40^{\circ}$. Our estimate has
to be considered as the maximal expected neutrino flux compatible with all the
available gamma ray data, since any leptonic contribution to the observed
gamma-ray emission would lower the neutrino flux. The diffuse flux of
neutrinos, if close to the maximum allowed level, may be detected by a
km$^3$--scale detector located in the northern hemisphere. A detection would
unambiguously reveal the hadronic origin of the diffuse gamma-ray emission.
