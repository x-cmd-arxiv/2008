several phenomena, which deteriorate the material quality (e.g. the
redistribution of the crystal lattice defects, appearance of the
electrode-adjacent non-ferroelectric layers or the spontaneous polarization
screening due to a free charge injection across the electrode-adjacent layer,
etc.). It is also known that the permittivity of ferroelectric polydomain films
is controlled by the sum of two contributions: the crystal lattice (intrinsic)
contribution and the domain wall movement (extrinsic) contribution. It is the
latter one, which is very sensitive to the aforementioned phenomena and which
plays a key role in the deterioration of the dielectric response of the
ferroelectric polydomain films. In this Article, there is presented a method
for the identification of the process, which is responsible for the
ferroelectric ageing. The method is based on the analysis of the evolution of
both the linear and nonlinear permittivity during ageing. Applicability of the
method is theoretically demonstrated on four ageing scenarios in two
qualitatively different systems where the evolution of the nonlinear
permittivity is controlled, first, by a redistribution of the pinning centers
on the domain wall and, second, by microstructural changes at the interface
between the ferroelectric layer and the electrode. It is shown that each ageing
scenario is characterized by unique trend in the evolution between the linear
and nonlinear part of the permittivity, which can be verified experimentally.

tidal field using analytical predictions and direct N-body simulations. We find
that dN/dt depends on the ratio R=r_h/r_j, where r_h is the half-mass radius
and r_j the radius of the zero-velocity surface. For R>0.05, the ""tidal
regime"", there is almost no dependence of dN/dt on R. To first order this is
because the fraction of escapers per relaxation time, t_rh, scales
approximately as R^1.5, which cancels out the r_h^1.5 term in t_rh. For R<0.05,
the ""isolated regime"", dN/dt scales as R^-1.5. Clusters that start with their
initial R, Ri, in the tidal regime dissolve completely in this regime and their
t_dis is insensitive to the initial r_h. We predicts that clusters that start
with Ri<0.05 always expand to the tidal regime before final dissolution. Their
t_dis has a shallower dependence on Ri than what would be expected when t_dis
is a constant times t_rh. For realistic values of Ri, the lifetime varies by
less than a factor of 1.5 due to changes in Ri. This implies that the
""survival"" diagram for globular clusters should allow for more small clusters
to survive. We note that with our result it is impossible to explain the
universal peaked mass function of globular cluster systems by dynamical
evolution from a power-law initial mass function, since the peak will be at
lower masses in the outer parts of galaxies. Our results finally show that in
the tidal regime t_dis scales as N^0.65/w, with w the angular frequency of the
cluster in the host galaxy. [ABRIDGED]

interplay of the Josephson effect and Coulomb blockade. Coupling to a graphene
substrate with gapless excitations further enhances charge fluctuations
favoring superconductivity. The effect is shown to scale exponentially with the

develop a theory, which quantitatively describes the quantum phase transition

reliable qualitative description for one-dimensional systems as well. We argue
that the local effect of dissipation-induced enhancement of superconductivity
is very robust and a similar sharp crossover should be present in finite

In addition, information pertaining to evolutionary relationships is contained

work, there is no simple framework for deducing structure, function, and

is sufficient to yield common structure/function relationships and sequence
identities as large as 88% may yet result in distinct structure and function

of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the four sides can be treated. The total
energy is also investigated, path by path. These results are used in an attempt
to clarify the physical reality of the repulsive (outward) force on the sides
of the box predicted by calculations that neglect both boundary divergences and
the exterior of the box. Previous authors have studied ""piston"" geometries that
avoid these problems and have found the force to be attractive. We consider a
""pistol"" geometry that comes closer to the original problem of a box with a
movable lid. We find again an attractive force, although its origin and
detailed behavior are somewhat different from the piston case. However, the
pistol (and the piston) model can be criticized for extending idealized
boundary conditions into short distances where they are physically implausible.
Therefore, it is of interest to see whether leaving the ultraviolet cutoff
finite yields results that are more plausible. We then find that the force
depends strongly on a geometrical parameter; it can be made repulsive, but only
by forcing that parameter into the regime where the model is least convincing
physically.

limit) and is supported by interferometric angular diameter measurements above
3000 K. Our metallicities are in excellent agreement (usually within 0.2 dex)
with recent determinations via independent techniques. A subsample of cool M
dwarfs with metallicity estimates based on hotter Hipparcos common
proper-motion companions indicates our metallicities are also reliable below
3000 K, a temperature range unexplored until now.
  The high quality of our data allow us to identify a striking feature in the
bolometric luminosity versus temperature plane, around the transition from K to
M dwarfs. We have compared our sample of stars with theoretical models and
conclude that this transition is due to an increase in the radii of the M
dwarfs, a feature which is not reproduced by theoretical models.

average fragmentation spacing in the nonlinear phase of evolution is in
excellent agreement with the prediction of linear perturbation theory. The time
scale for nonlinear growth and runaway of the first core is $\approx 10$ times
the calculated growth time $\taugm$ of the eigenmode with minimum growth time,
when starting from a uniform background state with small-amplitude white-noise
perturbations. Subcritical and transcritical models typically evolve on a
significantly longer time scale than the supercritical models. Infall motions
in the nonlinear fully-developed contracting cores are subsonic on the core
scale in subcritical and transcritical clouds, but are somewhat supersonic in
supercritical clouds. Core mass distributions are sharply peaked with a steep
decline to large masses, consistent with the existence of a preferred mass
scale for each unique set of dimensionless free parameters. However, a sum
total of results for various initial mass-to-flux ratios yields a broad
distribution reminiscent of observed core mass distributions. Based on our
results, we conclude that fragmentation spacings, magnitude of infall motions,
core shapes, and, especially, the curvature of magnetic field morphology, may
serve as indirect observational means of determining a cloud's ambient

more evolved cluster. The deep IRAC imaging reveals at least twelve outflows in
eight out of the nine regions, with nine outflows prominent in the 4.5 $\mu$m
band most probably attributed to shocked H$_2$ emission, two outflows dominated
by scattered light in the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m bands, and one outflow standing
out from its hydrocarbon emission in the 8.0 $\mu$m band. In comparison with
previous ground-based observations, our IRAC observations reveal new outflow
structures in five regions. The dramatically different morphologies of detected
outflows can be tentatively interpreted in terms of possible evolution of
massive outflows. The driving sources of these outflows are deeply embedded in
dense dusty cores revealed by previous millimeter interferometric observations.
We detect infrared counterparts of these dusty cores in the IRAC or MIPS 24
$\mu$m bands. Reflection nebulae dominated by the emission from UV heated
hydrocarbons in the 8 $\mu$m band can be found in most regions and they may

to permit fairly precise measurements of at least a portion of the sparticle
spectrum. Proposed mass reconstruction methods rely upon either inverting
invariant mass endpoint expressions or upon solving systems of mass-shell
equations. These methodologies suffer from the weakness that one certain
specific sparticle decay chain is assumed to account for all the events in the
sample. Taking two examples of techniques utilizing mass-shell equations, it is
found that also applying the wedgebox technique allows for the isolation of a
purer event sample, thus avoiding errors, possibly catastrophic, due to
mistaken assumptions about the decay chains involved and simultaneously
improving accuracy. What is innovative is using endpoint measurements (via the
wedgebox technique) to obtain a more homogeneous, well-understood sample set
rather than just using said endpoints to constrain the values of the masses
(here found by the mass-shell technique). The fusion of different established

In a spherical fusion category C, an equivariant indicator of an object in C is
defined as a functional on the Grothendieck algebra of the quantum double Z(C)
via generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. The set of all equivariant
indicators admits a natural action of the modular group. Using the properties
of equivariant indicators, we prove a congruence subgroup theorem for modular
categories. As a consequence, all modular representations of a modular category
have finite images, and they satisfy a conjecture of Eholzer. In addition, we
obtain two formulae for the generalized indicators, one of them a
generalization of Bantay's second indicator formula for a rational conformal
field theory. This formula implies a conjecture of Pradisi-Sagnotti-Stanev, as
well as a conjecture of Borisov-Halpern-Schweigert.

the sequence length required to resolve the tree (independent of any particular
branch length). We also show that this rate of sequence length growth can be
achieved by existing methods (including the simple `maximum parsimony' method),

lattice distortion followed by a stripe like commensurate antiferromagnetic

using a specific example of a technologically realizable nanopatterned surface,
we demonstrate that while very high enhancement factors (~10^12) can be found

because even a minute, inevitable rounding-off strongly suppresses the

determined redshifts for 426 candidates using the AAOmega spectrograph on the
AAT in service time. We identify 17 QSOs (M_B<= -23) in this pilot survey at
z=1.57-3.29. We combine our sample with an X-ray selected sample of QSOs in the
same field (a large fraction of which also comply with our KX selection) to
constrain the surface density of QSOs with K<=20, deriving limits on the likely
surface density of 85-150/deg^2. We use the good image quality available from
our near-infrared imaging to detect a spatially extended component of the QSO
light which probably represents the host galaxies. We also use our sample to
investigate routes to improve the selection of KX QSOs at faint limits in the
face of the significant contamination by compact, foreground galaxies. The
brightest examples from our combined QSO sample will be used in conjunction
with a large VLT VIMOS spectroscopic survey of high redshift galaxies in this
region to study the structures inhabited by gas, galaxies and growing
super-massive black holes at high redshifts in the UKIDSS UDS.

choose a $^{208}$Pb target, which is a spin-saturated spherical nucleus for
which reliable nuclear structure models exist. Microscopic scalar and vector
optical potentials are generated by folding invariant scalar and vector
scattering nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitudes, based on our recently developed
relativistic meson-exchange model, with Lorentz scalar and vector densities
resulting from the accurately calibrated PK1 relativistic mean field model of
nuclear structure. It is seen that phenomenological Pauli blocking (PB) effects
and density-dependent corrections to $\sigma$N and $\omega$N meson-nucleon
coupling constants modify the RIA microscopic scalar and vector optical
potentials so as to provide a consistent and quantitative description of all
elastic scattering observables, namely total reaction cross sections,
differential cross sections, analyzing powers and spin rotation functions. In
particular, the effect of PB becomes more significant at energies lower than

VHE) observations. A model calculation for the evolving EBL density produced by

emission of an aging stellar population. Emission from the dense HII regions
surrounding the stars (nebula) is included. The resulting EBL density for
different scenarios (metallicity, star formation rate, initial mass function)
is compared to the limit on the EBL density. The potential for detecting a
cut-off in HE/VHE spectra is discussed. Assuming a maximum contribution from

reciprocity or `semidualisation'. The latter is an algebraic operation defined
using quantum group methods that interchanges position and momentum. Using this
we are able to clarify the structural relationships between the effective
non-commutative geometries that have been discussed in the context of 3d
gravity. We show that the spin model based on D(U(su_2)) for quantum gravity
without cosmological constant is the semidual of a quantum particle on a
three-sphere, while the bicrossproduct (DSR) model is the semidual of a quantum
particle on hyperbolic space. We show further how the different models are all
specific limits of q-deformed models with q=e^{-\hbar \sqrt{-\Lambda}/m_p},
where m_p is the Planck mass and \Lambda is the cosmological constant, and
argue that semidualisation interchanges m_p and l_c, where l_c is the
cosmological length scale l_c=1/\sqrt{|\Lambda|}. We investigate the physics of
semidualisation by studying representation theory. In both the spin model and
its semidual we show that irreducible representations have a physical picture
as solutions of a respectively non-commutative/curved wave equation. We
explain, moreover, that the q-deformed model, at a certain algebraic level, is
self-dual under semidualisation.

ingredients of black hole or cosmological applications. The conditions imposed
in addition to spherical symmetry turn out to take a simple form at the
kinematical level of loop quantum gravity, which allows a discussion of their
implications at the quantum level. Moreover, the spherically symmetric setting
of inhomogeneity illustrates several non-trivial properties of lattice
refinements of discrete quantum gravity. Nevertheless, the situation at the
dynamical level is quite non-trivial and thus provides insights to the anomaly
problem. At an effective level, consistent versions of the dynamics are
presented which implement the conditions together with the dynamical
constraints of gravity in an anomaly-free manner. These are then used for
analytical as well as numerical investigations of the fate of classical
singularities, including non-spacelike ones, as they generically develop in
these models. None of the corrections used here resolve those singularities by
regular effective geometries. However, there are numerical indications that the
collapse ends in a tamer shell-crossing singularity prior to the formation of
central singularities for mass functions giving a regular conserved mass
density. Moreover, we find quantum gravitational obstructions to the existence
of exactly homogeneous solutions within this class of models. This indicates
that homogeneous models must be seen in a wider context of inhomogeneous
solutions and their reduction in order to provide reliable dynamical
conclusions.

distinguish MSSM and LHT before the discovery of any new resonances. Starting
with the lone Higgs scenario and the deviation in this measurement from the
Standard Model prediction (whether or not statistically significant), we offer
tests that may discriminate the models and search strategies of discovering new
physics signatures with increasing integrated luminosity.

examples of strong gravitational lensing, providing five large images of a
single source with well-resolved substructure. Using the information contained
in the positions and the shapes of the images, combined with the null space
information, a non-parametric technique is used to infer the strong lensing
mass map of the central region of this cluster. This yields a strong lensing
mass of 1.60x10^14 M_O within a 0.5' radius around the cluster center. This
mass distribution is then used as a case study of the monopole degeneracy,
which may be one of the most important degeneracies in gravitational lensing
studies and which is extremely hard to break. We illustrate the monopole
degeneracy by adding circularly symmetric density distributions with zero total
mass to the original mass map of Cl 0024+1654. These redistribute mass in
certain areas of the mass map without affecting the observed images in any way.
We show that the monopole degeneracy and the mass-sheet degeneracy together lie
at the heart of the discrepancies between different gravitational lens
reconstructions that can be found in the literature for a given object, and
that many images/sources, with an overall high image density in the lens plane,
are required to construct an accurate, high-resolution mass map based on
strong-lensing data.

particularly simple picture of how the derived category remains invariant
across all phases. The combinatorial problems involving local cohomology used

significance for the spin Calogero particles system whose phase space such
pairs represent. In the case $r=1$, this reproduces well-known results of
Wilson and others from the 1990's relating (spinless) Calogero-Moser systems to
the bispectrality of (scalar) differential operators. This new class of pairs
$(L, \Lambda)$ of bispectral matrix differential operators is different than
those previously studied in that $L$ acts from the left, but $\Lambda$ from the

Compton scattering, $\pi^- \gamma \to \pi^- \gamma $. Ultraviolet and infrared
divergencies are both treated in dimensional regularization. Analytical
expressions for the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ corrections to the invariant Compton
scattering amplitudes, $A(s,u)$ and $B(s,u)$, are presented for 11 classes of
contributing one-loop diagrams. Infrared finiteness of the virtual radiative
corrections is achieved (in the standard way) by including soft photon
radiation below an energy threshold $\lambda$, and its relation to the
experimental detection threshold is discussed. We find that the radiative
corrections are maximal in backward directions, reaching e.g. -2.4% for a
center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=4m_\pi$ and $\lambda=5 $MeV. Furthermore, we
extend our calculation of the radiative corrections by including the leading
pion structure effect (at low energies) in form of its electric and magnetic
polarizability difference, $\alpha_\pi - \beta_\pi \simeq 6\cdot 10^{-4}
$fm$^3$. We find that this structure effect does not change the relative size
and angular dependence of the radiative corrections to pion Compton scattering.
Our results are particularly relevant for analyzing the COMPASS experiment at
CERN which aims at measuring the pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities
with high statistics using the Primakoff effect.
