fields and their nonlinear counterparts in the context of cosmological
perturbation theory. Such functions express how a non-linearly evolved Fourier
mode depends on the full ensemble of modes in the initial density field. We
identify and resum the dominant diagrams in the large-$k$ limit, showing
explicitly that multi-point propagators decay into the nonlinear regime at the
same rate as the two-point propagator. These analytic results generalize the
large-$k$ limit behavior of the two-point propagator to arbitrary order. We
measure the three-point propagator as a function of triangle shape in numerical
simulations and confirm the results of our high-$k$ resummation. We show that
any $n-$point spectrum can be reconstructed from multi-point propagators, which
leads to a physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the power
spectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations at large scales. As a
first application of these results, we calculate the reduced bispectrum at
one-loop in renormalized perturbation theory and show that we can predict the
decrease in its dependence on triangle shape at redshift zero, when standard
perturbation theory is least successful.

root system as the extended S-duality group PGL(2,Z) of the theory, and the
walls of Weyl chambers as the walls of marginal stability for the relevant
two-centered solutions. This leads to an interpretation for the Weyl group as
the group of wall-crossing, or the group of discrete attractor flows.
Furthermore we propose an equivalence between a ""second-quantized multiplicity""
of a charge- and moduli-dependent highest weight vector and the dyon
degeneracy, and show that the wall-crossing formula following from our proposal
agrees with the wall-crossing formula obtained from the supergravity analysis.
This can be thought of as providing a microscopic derivation of the

to the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. Here we report the first
direct measurements on the electronic structure of a parent compound of the
newly discovered iron-based superconductor, BaFe$_2$As$_2$, which provides a
foundation for further studies. We show that the energy of the spin density
wave (SDW) in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ is lowered through exotic exchange splitting of
the band structure, rather than Fermi surface nesting of itinerant electrons.
This clearly demonstrates that a metallic SDW state could be solely induced by
interactions of local magnetic moments, resembling the nature of
antiferromagnetic order in cuprate parent compounds.

the Rutherford one since the effective potential at short distances is softer

Population structure typically arises from the heterogeneous distribution of
individuals in physical space or on social networks. Here we introduce a new
type of space to evolutionary game dynamics: phenotype space. The population is
well-mixed in the sense that everyone is equally likely to interact with
everyone else, but the behavioral strategies depend on distance in phenotype
space. Individuals might behave differently towards those who look similar or
dissimilar. Individuals mutate to nearby phenotypes. We study the `phenotypic
space walk' of populations. We present analytic calculations that bring
together ideas from coalescence theory and evolutionary game dynamics. As a
particular example, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in phenotype
space. We obtain a precise condition for natural selection to favor cooperators
over defectors: for a one-dimensional phenotype space and large population size
the critical benefit-to-cost ratio is given by b/c=1+2/sqrt{3}. We derive the
fundamental condition for any evolutionary game and explore higher dimensional
phenotype spaces.

an atomic beam works as a reservoir for the radiation field trapped inside the

ground state and, as in the cited article, neither atomic detection nor precise
interaction times between the atoms and the cavity mode are required. From this
same interaction, we can also generate an ideal squeezed reservoir for atomic
systems. For this purpose we have to assume, besides the engineered atom-field
interaction, a strong decay of the cavity field (i.e., the cavity decay must be
much stronger than the effective atom-field coupling). With this scheme, some
interesting effects in the dynamics of an atom in a squeezed reservoir could be

circumstellar dust by the strong radiation field from the highest mass star(s)

magnetorotational instability (MRI) can also possess additional, purely
hydrodynamic, drivers of turbulence. Even when the hydrodynamic processes, on
their own, generate negligible levels of transport, they may still affect the
evolution of the disk via their influence on the MRI. Here, we study the
interaction between the MRI and hydrodynamic turbulence using local MRI
simulations that include hydrodynamic forcing. As expected, we find that
hydrodynamic forcing is generally negligible if it yields a saturated kinetic
energy density that is small compared to the value generated by the MRI. For
stronger hydrodynamic forcing levels, we find that hydrodynamic turbulence
modifies transport, with the effect varying depending upon the spatial scale of
hydrodynamic driving. Large scale forcing boosts transport by an amount that is
approximately linear in the forcing strength, and leaves the character of the
MRI (for example the ratio between Maxwell and Reynolds stresses) unchanged, up
to the point at which the forced turbulence is an order of magnitude stronger
than that generated by the MRI. Low amplitude small scale forcing may modestly
suppress the MRI. We conclude that the impact of hydrodynamic turbulence on the
MRI is generically ignorable in cases, such as convection, where the additional
turbulence arises due to the accretion energy liberated by the MRI itself.
Hydrodynamic turbulence may affect (and either enhance or suppress) the MRI if
it is both strong, and driven by independent mechanisms such as self-gravity,
supernovae, or solid-gas interactions in multiphase protoplanetary disks.

massive stars, we investigate the impact of such ``dark matter burning'' for
the first stars in different environments of dark matter (DM) halos, in terms
of the ambient WIMP density (rho_chi). We find that, in agreement with existing
literature, stellar life times can be significantly prolonged for a certain
range of rho_\chi (i.e., 10^{10} ~ < \rho_\chi GeV/cm3 ~ < 10^{11} with the
current upper limit for the spin-dependent elastic scattering cross section

induced chemical mixing in rotating stars, in favor of abundant production of
primary nitrogen, massive helium stars and long gamma-ray bursts, from the
first stars. We also find that stars with rho_chi > 2*10^{11} GeV/cm3 may not
undergo nuclear burning stages, confirming the previous work, and that ionizing
photon fluxes from such DM supported stars are very weak. Delayed metal
enrichment and slow reionization in the early universe would have resulted if

consequences of PopIII stars on the local metallicity distribution function of
the Galactic halo (from the recent Hamburg/ESO survey of metal-poor stars) and
on the evolution of abundances with metallicity (based on the ESO large program

generalizations are the inclusion of anisotropy in the pair-wise nearest

cumulant to estimate the correlation length exponent $\nu$ and the order
parameter exponent $\beta$. Our principal results are that in a range of
parameters, the Ashkin-Teller model as well as its generalization has an order
parameter susceptibility which diverges as $T \to T^*$ and an order parameter
below $T^*$. Importantly, however, there is no divergence in the specific heat.
This puts the properties of the model in accord with the experimental results
in the underdoped cuprates. We also calculate the magnitude of the ""bump"" in
the specific heat in the critical region to put limits on its observability.
Finally, we show that the staggered magnetization couples to the uniform

transients in quiescence. In this state mass accretion is thought to follow the
geometry of an outer optically thick, geometrically thin disc and an inner
optically thin, geometrically thick radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF). The inner flow is likely also coupled to the jets near the black hole
that are often seen in such systems. The goal of the study is to see whether
the X-ray emission in the quiescent state is mainly powered by the accretion
flow or the jets. Using data from deep XMM-Newton observations of selected
black hole transients, we have found that the quiescent X-ray spectra are, to a
high precision, of power-law shape in the cases of GRO J1655-40 and V404 Cyg.
Such spectra deviate significantly from the expected X-ray spectrum of the RIAF
at very low accretion rates. On the other hand, they can naturally be explained
by emission from the jets, if the emitting electrons follow a power-law
spectral distribution (as is often assumed). The situation remains ambiguous in
the case of XTE J1550-564, due to the relatively poorer quality of the data. We
discuss the implication of the results.

scoring functions out of RAId score, K-score, Hyperscore and XCorr, RAId_aPS
generates the corresponding score histograms of all possible peptides using

E-values for a list of candidate peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the

R-lattice which is functorial in finite (generically etale) K-morphisms of X
and which is preserved by the cup-product auto-duality on H^1_{dR}(X/K). Our
construction of this lattice uses a certain class of normal proper models of X
and relative dualizing sheaves. We show that our lattice naturally contains the
lattice furnished by the (truncated) de Rham complex of a regular proper
R-model of X and that the index for this inclusion of lattices is a numerical
invariant of X (we call it the de Rham conductor). Using work of Bloch and
Liu-Saito, we prove that the de Rham conductor of X is bounded above by the
Artin conductor, and bounded below by the Efficient conductor. We then study
how the position of our canonical lattice inside the de Rham cohomology of X is
affected by finite extension of scalars.

(GS) on typical complex networks, such as scale-free networks, small-world
networks, random networks and modular networks. By adopting the
auxiliary-system approach to networks, we show that GS can take place in
oscillator networks with both heterogeneous and homogeneous degree
distribution, regardless of whether the coupled chaotic oscillators are
identical or nonidentical. For coupled identical oscillators on networks, we
find that there exists a general bifurcation path from initial
non-synchronization to final global complete synchronization (CS) via GS as the
coupling strength is increased. For coupled nonidentical oscillators on
networks, we further reveal how network topology competes with the local
dynamics to dominate the development of GS on networks. Especially, we analyze
how different coupling strategies affect the development of GS on complex
networks. Our findings provide a further understanding for the occurrence and
development of collective behavior in complex networks.

unconditioned maximum of a function defined on a unit $N$-sphere for
equiprobable states and on an $N$-ellipsoid if the states are given with
different probabilities. We established that for equiprobable states a point on
the sphere with equal values of Cartesian coordinates, which we call symmetric

formulated for which the mean efficiency for equiprobable states takes its
maximal value at the symmetric point. This set, in particular, includes
previously studied symmetric states. A subset of symmetric states, for which
the optimal measurement corresponds to a POVM requiring a one-dimensional

function via quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Besides, it is found that the time
dependence of speckle correlation is determined by the relaxation dynamics of

stable, leading to a long relaxation time. While, at high temperature, cluster

relativistic illusion of ballistic moving ejecta, and confirmed in a few tens
of sources observationally. However, the recent results of the long-term
multi-epoch observations of quasars, active galaxies, tracing the structure
further along the jets and following the motion of individual features for
longer time, rise questions that are difficult to understand by the standard
ballistic model. I.e., the ejecta are aligned with the local jet direction,
instead of the core; and within individual jets apparently inward-moving
features are observed. Here we show that these unexpected phenomena, although
only a small fraction among large samples, indicate the existence of
non-ballistic jet motion, in which a continuous jet produces a discrete hot
spot. And the precession of such a hot spot in the plane of the sky appears
superluminal. Therefore, an unified and simple interpretation to the new
results is obtained, which can be further tested through its predictions on the
evolution of ejecta. The study is of importance in the understanding of the
nature of superluminal motion, the interaction of jets and surrounding
materials, as well as the common physics underlying quasars and microquasars.

a general overview of microscopic approaches based on mean-field and applied to

heavy-ion collisions. We present both formal aspects and practical applications
of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. The TDHF approach gives a
mean field dynamics of the system under the assumption that particles evolve
independently in their self-consistent average field. As an example, we study
the fusion of both spherical and deformed nuclei with TDHF. We also focus on
nucleon transfer which may occur between nuclei below the barrier. These
studies allow us to specify the range of applications of TDHF in one hand, and,
on the other hand, its intrinsic limitations: absence of tunneling below the
Coulomb barrier, missing dissipative effects and/or quantum fluctuations.
Time-dependent mean-field theories should be improved to properly account for
these effects. Several approaches, generically named ""beyond TDHF"" are
presented which account for instance for pairing and/or direct nucleon-nucleon
collisions. Finally we discuss recent progresses in exact ab-initio methods
based on the stochastic mean-field concept.

matter effects depend on the neutrino incident angle $\theta$, the neutrino
mass hierarchy $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$, the crossing probability at the high
resonance region inside the supernova, $P_{H}$, the neutrino temperature,
$T_{\alpha}$, and the pinching parameter in the neutrino spectrum,
$\eta_{\alpha}$. We also take into account the collective effects due to
neutrino-neutrino interactions inside the supernova. With the expression for
the dependence of $P_H$ on the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, we obtain
the relations between $\theta_{13}$ and the event numbers for various reaction
channels of supernova neutrinos. Using these relations, we propose a possible
method to acquire information about $\theta_{13}$ smaller than $1.5^\circ$.
Such a sensitivity cannot yet be achieved by the Daya Bay reactor neutrino

or constructive spin interferences caused by the SOI, the array can be totally
opaque for certain ranges of $k$, while there are parameter values where it is
completely transparent. Spin resolved transmission probabilities show
nontrivial spin transformations at the outputs of the arrays. When point-like
random scattering centers are placed between the rings, the Aharonov-Bohm peaks
split, and an oscillatory behavior of the conductance emerges as a function of
the SOI strength.

along with a new QML definition of the quantum teleport algorithm. The
categorical operational semantics of QML is also briefly introduced, in the
form of annotated quantum circuits. This definition leads to a denotational
semantics, given in terms of superoperators. Finally, an implementation in
Haskell of the semantics for QML is presented as a compiler. The compiler takes
QML programs as input, which are parsed into a Haskell datatype. The output
from the compiler is either a quantum circuit (operational), an isometry (pure
denotational) or a superoperator (impure denotational). Orthogonality
judgements and problems with coproducts in QML are also discussed.

turbulence. Quantum turbulence (QT) was discovered in superfluid $^4$He in the
1950s, and the research has tended toward a new direction since the mid 90s.
The similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence have
become an important area of research. QT is comprised of quantized vortices
that are definite topological defects, being expected to yield a model of
turbulence that is much simpler than the classical model. The general
introduction of the issue and a brief review on classical turbulence are
followed by a description of the dynamics of quantized vortices. Then, we
discuss the energy spectrum of QT at very low temperatures. At low wavenumbers,
the energy is transferred through the Richardson cascade of quantized vortices,
and the spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov law, which is the most important
statistical law in turbulence; this classical region shows the similarity to
conventional turbulence. At higher wavenumbers, the energy is transferred by
the Kelvin-wave cascade on each vortex. This quantum regime depends strongly on
the nature of each quantized vortex. The possible dissipation mechanism is
discussed. Finally, important new experimental studies, which include
investigations into temperature-dependent transition to QT, dissipation at very
low temperatures, QT created by vibrating structures, and visualization of QT,
are reviewed. The present article concludes with a brief look at QT in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates.

partitioning techniques that yields the optimal block-tridiagonal form for

performance gains in transport calculations, and allows to apply conventional
two-terminal algorithms to arbitrary complex geometries, including
multi-terminal structures. The block-tridiagonalization algorithm can thus be
the foundation for a generic quantum transport code, applicable to arbitrary
tight-binding systems. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying
the block-tridiagonalization algorithm together with the recursive Green's
function algorithm to various examples of mesoscopic transport in
two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductors and graphene.

characterize situations where a firm manager decides optimally to postpone
dividend distribution in order to invest in a reversible growth opportunity

means that the firm may disinvest from the modern technology and return back to

galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey sample. The relation
between PAH 8 and 24 micron emission measured in ~2 kpc regions is found to
exhibit a significant amount of scatter, and strong spatial variations are
observed in the (PAH 8 micron)/24 micron surface brightness ratio. In
particular, the (PAH 8 micron)/24 micron surface brightness ratio is observed
to be high in the diffuse interstellar medium and low in bright star-forming
regions and other locations with high 24 micron surface brightness. PAH 8
micron emission is found to be well-correlated with 160 micron emission on
spatial scales of ~2 kpc, and the (PAH 8 micron)/160 micron surface brightness
ratio is generally observed to increase as the 160 micron surface brightness
increases. These results suggest that the PAHs are associated with the diffuse,
cold dust that produces most of the 160 micron emission in these galaxies, and
the variations in the (PAH 8 micron)/160 micron ratio may generally be
indicative of either the intensity or the spectrum of the interstellar
radiation field that is heating both the PAHs and the diffuse interstellar
dust.

decoding effort grows exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas.
This was circumvented by orthogonal codes introduced by Wang and Xia [2].
Unfortunately, based on Alamouti code [3], this design is restricted to two
antennas. However, by relaxing the orthogonality condition, we prove here that
it is possible to design L2-orthogonal space-time codes which achieve full rate

two-antenna code proposed by Wang and Xia [2] from pointwise to
L2-orthogonality and in part two we present the first L2-orthogonal code for
CPM with three antennas. In this report, we detail these results and focus on
the properties of these codes. Of special interest is the optimization of the

go between substrates and products, or substrates and substrates, or both?
Should vertices represent substances or reactions? Different definitions encode
different information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four
different graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different
organisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing
the overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and
also by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that
other authors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find

(GRBs) is that the total energy emitted by a GRB in gamma-rays has a very
narrow distribution around 10^51 erg, which has led people to claim that GRBs
are standard energy explosions. As people made the claim they have ignored the
selection biases which must be important since GRB observations are strongly
fluence or flux-limited. In this paper we show that, when the selection effects
are considered, the intrinsic distribution of the GRB energy can be very broad.
The number of faint GRBs has been significantly underestimated because of the
fluence or flux limit. The bright part of the distribution has been affected by
another important selection effect arising from the beaming of GRB jets, which
is instrument-independent and caused by the fact that brighter GRBs tend to
have smaller jet angles and hence smaller probabilities to be detected. Our
finding indicates that GRBs are not a standard energy reservoir, and challenges
the proposal that GRBs can be used as standard candles to probe cosmology.

conjectured that the complete graph on two vertices $K_2$ is the only regular

It has long been assumed that the giant planet Jupiter acts as a shield,
significantly lowering the impact rate on the Earth from both cometary and
asteroidal bodies. Such shielding, it is claimed, enabled the development and
evolution of life in a collisional environment which is not overly hostile. The
reduced frequency of impacts, and of related mass extinctions, would have
allowed life the time to thrive, where it would otherwise have been suppressed.
However, in the past, little work has been carried out to examine the validity
of this idea. In the first of several papers, we examine the degree to which
the impact risk resulting from a population representative of the asteroids is
enhanced or lessened by the presence of a giant planet, in an attempt to fully
understand the impact regime under which life on Earth has developed. Our
results show that the situation is far less clear cut that has previously been
assumed - for example, the presence of a giant planet can act to enhance the
impact rate of asteroids on the Earth significantly.

nanostructures prepared by short time diffusion of boron after preliminary
oxidation of the n-type Si (100) surface. These Si-based nanostructures
represent the p-type high mobility silicon quantum well (Si-QW) confined by the
delta - barriers heavily doped with boron. The ESR studies show that the delta
- barriers appear to consist of the trigonal dipole centers, B(+)-B(-), which
are caused by the negative-U reconstruction of the shallow boron acceptors,
2B(0)=>B(+)-B(-). The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the
resistance, thermo-emf, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility demonstrate
that the high temperature superconductivity observed seems to result from the
transfer of the small hole bipolarons through these negative-U dipole centers
of boron at the Si-QW - delta - barrier interfaces. The value of the
superconductor energy gap obtained is in a good agreement with the data derived
from the oscillations of the conductance in normal state and of the
zero-resistance supercurrent in superconductor state as a function of the bias
voltage. These oscillations appear to be correlated by on- and off-resonance
tuning the two-dimensional subbands of holes with the Fermi energy in the
superconductor delta - barriers. Finally, the proximity effect in the S- Si-QW
-S structure is revealed by the findings of the multiple Andreev reflection
(MAR) processes and the quantization of the supercurrent.

late-type, nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud

decade-long effort of the Montr\'eal Massive Star Group to monitor every known
WR star in the Magellanic Clouds except for the 6 crowded WNL stars in R136,
which will be discussed elsewhere. The focus of our survey was to monitor the
so-called WNL stars for radial-velocity (RV) variability in order to identify
the short- to intermediate-period ($P \la 200$ days) binaries among them. Our
results are in line with results of previous studies of other WR subtypes, and
show that the binary frequency among LMC WNL stars is statistically consistent
with that of WNL stars in the Milky Way. We have identified four previously
unknown binaries, bringing the total number of known WNL binaries in the LMC to
nine. Since it is very likely that none but one of the binaries are classical,
helium-burning WNL stars, but rather superluminous, hence extremely massive,
hydrogen-burning objects, our study has dramatically increased the number of
known binaries harbouring such objects, and thus paved the way to determine
their masses through model-independent, Keplerian orbits. It is expected that
some of the stars in our binaries will be among the most massive known. With
the binary status of each WR star now known, we also studied the photometric
and X-ray properties of our program stars using archival MACHO photometry as
well as Chandra and ROSAT data. We find that one of our presumably single WNL
stars is among the X-ray brightest WR sources known. We also identify a binary
candidate from its RV variability and X-ray luminosity which harbours the most
luminous WR star known in the Local Group.

of the density functional allows us to study the phase behavior of the biaxial

tetratic symmetry, although metastable with respect to the crystal, as our MC

four--phase point where four spinodals, corresponding to phase transitions
between phases with different symmetries, meet together. The location of this
point is quite sensitive to particle cross section, which suggests that
optimizing the particle geometry could be a useful criterion in the design of
colloidal particles that can exhibit an increased stability of the biaxial

stars and their evolution is described as a simple cooling process. Recently,
it has been possible to determine with an unprecedented precision their
luminosity function, that is, the number of stars per unit volume and
luminosity interval. We show here that the shape of the bright branch of this
function is only sensitive to the averaged cooling rate of white dwarfs and we
propose to use this property to check the possible existence of axions, a
proposed but not yet detected weakly interacting particle. Our results indicate
that the inclusion of the emission of axions in the evolutionary models of
white dwarfs noticeably improves the agreement between the theoretical
calculations and the observational white dwarf luminosity function. The best
fit is obtained for m_a cos^2 \beta ~ 5 meV, where m_a is the mass of the axion
and cos^2 \beta is a free parameter. We also show that values larger than 10
meV are clearly excluded. The existing theoretical and observational
uncertainties do not allow yet to confirm the existence of axions, but our
results clearly show that if their mass is of the order of few meV, the white
dwarf luminosity function is sensitive enough to detect their existence.

measurable in the layers where Y and Eu are concentrated, increase in layers
where the Halpha core is formed, reach a maximum of 200-300 m/s in the layers

second pulsation maximum indicated by TbIII lines which form in the uppermost

confirmed in the Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 region. Through deep, I, z', J, H, K
photometry of a 20' x 20' field in OMC 2/3, we selected brown dwarf candidates
for follow-up spectroscopy. Low resolution far-red and near-infrared spectra
were obtained for the candidates, and 19 young brown dwarfs in the OMC 2/3
region are confirmed. They exhibit spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to
approximate masses of 0.075-0.015 M_solar using the evolutionary models of
Baraffe et al. (1998). At least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs has
strong Halpha emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. In addition,
we confirm 21 new low mass members with spectral types of M4-M6, corresponding
to approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 M_solar in OMC 2/3. By comparing pre-main
sequence tracks to the positions of the members in the H-R diagram, we find
that most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 Myr, but find a number of low
mass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 Myr. The discrepancy in the
stellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low luminosity
sources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an age
spread in the OMC 2/3 region. We discuss possible reasons for this apparent age
spread.

spin fluctuation theory with a high limit of accuracy. A magnetic field
suppresses the amplitude of the spin fluctuations and recovers conventional
Fermi liquid behavior, connecting both states continuously.

together with computable criteria for the separation of the two sets. When
applied to O(d)-covariant channels this leads to a complete characterization
and reveals a remarkable feature: instances of channels which are not in the
convex hull of unitaries can return to it when either taking finitely many
copies of them or supplementing with a completely depolarizing channel. In
these scenarios this implies that a channel whose noise initially resists any
environment-assisted attempt of correction can become perfectly correctable.

because the exclusion principle prevents them from forming sizable matter
contributions. They can thus describe the matter ingredients only truly
microscopically and it is not possible to avoid strong quantum regimes by
positing a large matter content. Moreover, possible parity violating effects
are important especially in loop quantum cosmology whose basic object is a
difference equation for the wave function of the universe defined on a discrete
space of triads. The two orientations of a triad are interchanged by a parity
transformation, which leaves the difference equation invariant for ordinary
matter. Here, we revisit and extend loop quantum cosmology by introducing
fermions and the gravitational torsion they imply, which renders the parity
issue non-trivial. A treatable locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi model is
introduced which clearly shows the role of parity. General wave functions
cannot be parity-even or odd, and parity violating effects in matter influence
the microscopic big bang transition which replaces the classical singularity in
loop quantum cosmology.

  on Astronomy and Relativistic Astrophysics, Joao Pessoa, Brazil)",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating is the most
challenging problem of modern cosmology. In the context of general relativity,
there are many dark energy candidates to explain the observed acceleration. In
this work we focus our attention on two kinds of simplified Chaplygin gas
cosmological accelerating models recently proposed in the literature. In the
first scenario, the simplified Chaplygin gas works like a Quintessence model
while in the second one, it plays the role of a Quartessence (an unification of
the dark sector). Firstly, in order to limit the free parameters of both
models, we discuss the age of high redshift objects with special emphasis to
the old quasar APM 08279+5255 at $z = 3.91$. The basic finding is that this old
high redshift object constrain severely the simplified Chaplygin cosmologies.
Secondly, through a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and a sample of old high redshift galaxies (OHRGs) we also estimate the
value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$. Our approach suggests that the
combination of these two independent phenomena provides an interesting method
to constrain the Hubble constant.

distribution in galaxy lenses based solely on the angular distribution of
images in quads around the lens center. The method requires the knowledge of
the lens center location, but the images' distances from the lens center are
not used at all. If the images of a quad are numbered in order of arrival time,
\theta_1 through \theta_4, and \theta_{ij} is the angle between images i and j,
then we define the 'bisector' plane whose axes are linear combinations of
\theta_{23} and \theta_{14}. The bisector plane of a given lens contains all
the quads produced by the lens. We show empirically that all two-fold symmetric
lenses with convex, i.e. non-wavy or petal-like isodensity contours are
identical in the bisector plane of their quads. We also study lenses with
twisting isodensity contours, lumpy substructure, etc. Our results suggest that
to reproduce the general characteristics of the observed quad population,
kpc-scale substructure must be a common feature of galaxy lenses.

echos, i.e. delayed inverse Compton emission from secondary $e^{\pm}$ pairs

radiation. We investigate the detectability of such emission with modern-day
gamma-ray telescopes. The spectra and light curves are calculated for a wide
range of parameters, applying the formalism recently developed by Ichiki et al.
The flux depends strongly on the unknown magnitude and coherence length of
intergalactic magnetic fields, and we delineate the range of field strength and
redshift that allow detectable echos. Relevant uncertainties such as the
high-energy cutoff of the primary gamma-ray spectrum and the intensity of the
cosmic infrared background are addressed. GLAST and MAGIC may be able to detect
pair echo emission from GRBs with redshift $\lesssim 1$ if the primary spectra
extend to $\sim 10 ~ {\rm TeV}$.
