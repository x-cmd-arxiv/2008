and other areas is briefly reviewed. Assuming such dimensionality to be $3 +
\epsilon$, a limit to $\epsilon$ can be inferred from COBE satellite data. The
available data for the cosmic microwave background radiation spectrum are
fitted by a Planck's radiation distribution generalized to non integer space
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that the shape of the CMBR spectrum, which
does not depend on the absolute normalization, is correctly described from this
distribution provided the absolute temperature is equal to 2.726 $\pm$
$0.003\times 10^{-2}$ K and $\epsilon = - (0.957 \pm 0.006) \times 10^{-5}$.
This value for $\epsilon$ is shown to be consistent with what is found on a
very different spatial scale based on a quantum field phenomenon. The
$|\epsilon|$ is interpreted as an upper limit for how much space dimensionality
could have deviated from three. In other words, this is the maximum fluctuation
space dimensionality should have experienced in a spatial and temporal scale
compared to that of the decoupling era.

morphology and symmetry suggested by Chandra observations (torus and jet-like
features) are basically preserved in the radio range in spite of the rich
structure observed in the radio emission of this PWN, including several arcs,
bright knots, extensions and filaments. The reprocessed X-ray images show for
the first time that the X-ray plasma fills almost the same volume as the radio
PWN. Notably the X-ray maximum does not coincide with the radio maximum and the
neutron star candidate CXOU J174722.8-280915 lies within a small depression in
the radio emission. From the new radio data we have refined the flux density
estimates, obtaining S(PWN) ~ 1.57 Jy, almost constant between 3.6 and 20 cm.
For the whole SNR (compact core and shell), a flux density S(at 20 cm)= 11.5 Jy
was estimated. Based on the new and the existing 90 cm flux density estimates,
we derived alpha(PWN)=-0.18+/-0.04 and alpha(shell)=-0.68+/- 0.07. From the
combination of the radio data with X-ray data, a spectral break is found near
nu ~ 2.4 x 10^(12) Hz. The total radio PWN luminosity is L(radio)=1.2 x 10^(35)
erg s^(-1) when a distance of 8.5 kpc is adopted. By assuming equipartition

relation between X-ray luminosity and pulsar energy loss rate, and the

structures in a thickened plane made out of intertwining strands of yarn.
Factoring out the group of translation symmetries of such a structure gives
rise to a link diagram in a thickened torus. Such a diagram on a standard torus
is converted into a classical link by including two auxiliary components which
form the cores of the complementary solid tori. The resulting link, called a
kernel for the structure, is determined by a choice of generators u and v for
the group of symmetries.
  A normalised form of the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of a kernel is
used to provide polynomial invariants of the original structure which are
essentially independent of the choice of generators. It gives immediate
information about the existence of closed curves and other topological features
in the original textile structure. Because of its natural algebraic properties
under coverings we can recover the polynomial for kernels based on a proper
subgroup from the polynomial derived from the full symmetry group of the
structure. This enables two structures to be compared at similar scales, even
when one has a much smaller minimal repeating cell than the other.
  Examples of simple traditional structures are given, and their Alexander data
polynomials are presented to illustrate the techniques and results.

the resulting transfer matrix. This allows efficient computation of phase
diagrams and force-extension curves (isotherms). While the main focus is on
exposition of the transfer matrix technique, we provide general arguments for a
reentrant melting transition in stiff double strands. Our theoretical approach
can also be extended to study polymers with bubbles of any number of strands,
with potential applications to molecules such as collagen.

perturbative expressions for the image positions, magnifications and time

  This book is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter briefly recalls
some of the basic concepts in order to make this book self-contained. Chapter
two introduces the notion of set vector spaces which is the most generalized
concept of vector spaces. Set vector spaces lends itself to define new classes
of vector spaces like semigroup vector spaces and group vector spaces. These
are also generalization of vector spaces. The fuzzy analogue of these concepts
are given in Chapter three. In Chapter four, set vector spaces are generalized
to biset bivector spaces and not set vector spaces. This is done taking into
account the advanced information technology age in which we live. As
mathematicians, we have to realize that our computer-dominated world needs
special types of sets and algebraic structures. Set n-vector spaces and their
generalizations are carried out in Chapter five. Fuzzy n-set vector spaces are
introduced in the sixth chapter. The seventh chapter suggests more than three
hundred problems.

Alexander polynomial of the singularity, we can deduce a formula of A'Campo

X-3 using the energy-resolved dust-scattered X-ray halo. By comparing the
observed X-ray halos in 200 eV bands from 2-5 keV to the halo profiles
predicted by the Weingartner & Draine interstellar grain model, we find that
the vast majority (about 70%) of the dust along the line of sight to the system
is located within about 300 pc of the Sun, although the halo measurements are
insensitive to dust very close to the source. One of the Chandra observations
occurred during an egress from eclipse as the pulsar emerged from behind the
mass-donating primary. By comparing model halo light curves during this
transition to the halo measurements, a source distance of 5.7 +/- 1.5 kpc (68%
confidence level) is estimated, although we find this result depends on the
distribution of dust on very small scales. Nevertheless, this value is
marginally inconsistent with the commonly accepted distance to Cen X-3 of 8
kpc. We also find that the energy scaling of the scattering optical depth
predicted by the Weingartner & Draine interstellar grain model does not
accurately represent the results determined by X-ray halo studies of Cen X-3.
Relative to the model, there appears to be less scattering at low energies or
more scattering at high energies in Cen X-3.

assumptions not necessarily valid in modern LCDM contexts: that satellites and
orbits are rigid and circular, with slow decay over many orbital times from
dynamical friction. This leads to a linear scaling of disk heating with
satellite mass: disk heights and velocity dispersions scale ~M_sat/M_disk. In
turn, observed disk thicknesses present strong constraints on merger histories:
the implication for the Milky Way is that <5% of its mass could come from
mergers since z~2, in conflict with cosmological predictions. More
realistically, satellites merge on nearly radial orbits, and once near the
disk, resonant interactions efficiently remove angular momentum while tidal
effects strip mass, leading to rapid merger/destruction in a couple of
free-fall plunges. Under these conditions the proper heating efficiency is
non-linear in mass ratio, ~(M_sat/M_disk)^2. We derive the scaling of disk
scale heights and velocity dispersions as a function of mass ratio and disk gas
content in this regime, and show this accurately describes the results of
simulations with proper 'live' halos and disks. Under realistic circumstances,
disk heating in minor mergers is suppressed by an order of magnitude relative
to expectations of previous models. We show that the Milky Way disk could have
absorbed ~5-10 1:10 mass-ratio mergers since z=2, in agreement with
cosmological models. These distinctions lead to dramatic differences in which
mass ratios are most important for disk heating and in the isophotal shapes of
disk+bulge systems.

contrast to $S_n$, the d-entropy is not conserved in time in closed Hamiltonian

very generic assumptions of the locality of the Hamiltonian and
non-integrability the d-entropy becomes a unique function of the average energy

Seyfert-like AGN that dominate the hard X-ray background at z~1. Over 1200
starburst disk models, based on the theory developed by Thompson et al., are
calculated for five input parameters: the black hole mass, the radial size of
the starburst disk, the dust-to-gas ratio, the efficiency of angular momentum
transport in the disk, and the gas fraction at the outer disk radius. We find
that a large dust-to-gas ratio, a relatively small starburst disk, a
significant gas mass fraction, and efficient angular momentum transport are all
important to produce a starburst disk that can potentially obscure an AGN. The
typical maximum star-formation rate in the disks is ~10 solar masses per year.
Assuming no mass-loss due to outflows, the starburst disks feed gas onto the
black hole at rates sufficient to produce hard X-ray luminosities of
10^{43}-10^{44} erg s^{-1}. The starburst disks themselves should be detectable
at mid-infrared and radio wavelengths; at z=0.8, the predicted fluxes are ~1
mJy at 24microns and ~10-30 microJy at 1.4GHz. Thus, we predict a large
fraction of radio/X-ray matches in future deep radio surveys. The starburst
disks should be easily distinguished from AGN in future 100microns surveys by
Herschel with expected fluxes of ~5 mJy. Any AGN-obscuring starbursts will be
associated with hot dust, independent of AGN heating, resulting in observable
signatures for separating galactic and nuclear star-formation. Finally, because
of the competition between gas and star-formation, nuclear starbursts will be
associated with lower-luminosity AGN. Thus, this phenomenon is a natural
explanation for the observed decrease in the fraction of obscured AGN with
luminosity.

using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including galactic outflows. We
consider the effects of ionization background variations, non-equilibrium
ionization and cooling, uniform metallicity, and small-scale (sub-resolution)
turbulence. Our main results are 1) IGM O VI is predominantly photo-ionized
with T= 10^(4.2+/-0.2) K. A key reason for this is that O VI absorbers
preferentially trace over-enriched regions of the IGM at a given density, which
enhances metal-line cooling such that absorbers can cool within a Hubble time.
As such, O VI is not a good tracer of the WHIM. 2) The predicted O VI
properties fit observables only if sub-resolution turbulence is added. The
required turbulence increases with O VI absorber strength such that stronger
absorbers arise from more recent outflows with turbulence dissipating on the
order of a Hubble time. The amount of turbulence is consistent with other
examples of turbulence observed in the IGM and galactic halos. 3) Metals traced
by O VI and H I do not trace exactly the same baryons, but reside in the same
large-scale structure. Observed alignment statistics are reproduced in our
simulations. 4) Photo-ionized O VI traces gas in a variety of environments, and
is not directly associated with the nearest galaxy, though is typically nearest
to ~0.1L* galaxies. Weaker O VI components trace some of the oldest cosmic
metals. 5) Very strong absorbers are more likely to be collisionally ionized,
tracing more recent enrichment (<2 Gyr) within or near galactic halos.

survival amplitude of an unstable state in the long time region: In 1957
Khalfin proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity
more slowly than any exponential function of $t$. This effect can be described
in terms of time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$ and then the Khalfin result
means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant for long times but that it tends
to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity. It appears that a similar conclusion can
be drawn for the energy of the unstable state for a large class of models of
unstable particles: This energy should be much smaller for suitably long times
$t$ than the energy of this state for $t$ of the order of the lifetime of the
considered state. Within a given model we show that the energy corrections in
the long ($t \to \infty$) and relatively short (lifetime of the state) time
regions, are different. It is shown that these corrections decrease to ${\cal

E}_{\phi}$ is the energy of the system in the state $|\phi>$ measured at times
$t \sim \tau_{\phi}= \frac{\hbar}{\gamma}$. This is a purely quantum mechanical
effect. It is hypothesized that there is a possibility to detect this effect by
analyzing the spectra of distant astrophysical objects. The above property of
unstable states may influence the measured values of astrophysical and
cosmological parameters.

maximum circular velocities in the range 200-250 km/seg and to have
bulge-to-disk ratios similar to that of the Milky Way. We find that model MW
galaxies formed quietly through the accretion of cold gas and small satellite
systems. Only 12 per cent of our model galaxies experienced a major merger
during their lifetime. Most of the stars formed in situ, with only about 15 per
cent of the final mass gathered through accretion. Supernovae and AGN feedback
play an important role in the evolution of these systems. At high redshifts,
when the potential wells of the MW progenitors are shallower, winds driven by
supernovae explosions blow out a large fraction of the gas and metals. As the
systems grow in mass, SN feedback effects decrease and AGN feedback takes over,
playing a more important role in the regulation of the star formation activity
at lower redshifts. Although model Milky Way galaxies have been selected to lie
in a narrow range of maximum circular velocities, they nevertheless exhibit a
significant dispersion in the final stellar masses and metallicities. Our
analysis suggests that this dispersion results from the different accretion
histories of the parent dark matter haloes. Statically, we also find evidences

formation

9 objects allow the rejection of one foreground star and the selection of four
O-type stars, which were later observed at higher resolution. In a subsequent
run, we observed three more stars in the classification region and three other
stars in the far red. We identify five (perhaps six) new evolved very massive
stars and three main sequence O-type stars, all of which are likely to be
members of Cyg OB2. The new findings allow a much better definition of the
upper HR diagram, suggesting an age ~2.5Myr for the association and hinting
that the O3-5 supergiants in the association are blue stragglers, either
younger or following a different evolutionary path from other cluster members.
Though the bulk of the early stars seems to belong to an (approximately)
single-age population, there is ample evidence for the presence of somewhat
older stars at the same distance. Our results suggest that, even though Cyg OB2
is unlikely to contain as many as 100 O-type stars, it is indeed substantially
more massive than was thought prior to recent infrared surveys.

approaches the Gaussian law. The degree of its similarity to the Gaussian

an event concentration diagram or a variant of the Error Diagram (ED).
  We demonstrate the application of the method by using our long-term forecast
of seismicity in two western Pacific regions. We compare the ED for these

earthquakes in these regions are concentrated in narrow subduction belts, using
the forecast density as a template or baseline for the ED is a more convenient

other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or
susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts may play a significant
role. We develop analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the
growth rate, probability, and size of epidemics and validate the predictions
with a realistic social network. We find that (for given degree distribution
and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the
growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling
the probability of an epidemic, and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the
dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring
closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist
between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in
reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering largest when the
population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also
strongly clustered. Our most significant contribution is a systematic way to
address clustering in infectious disease models, and our results have a number

recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different
graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic
assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node
compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main
research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for
approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In
this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate
compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching
problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide.
We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are
pairs of graphs and the `labels' are matches between them. Our experimental
results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of
standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear

field do not exceed 25% of the observed amplitude even for strong fields of
1400-1900 G. This can be an indication that other effects (e.g. background
flows and non-uniform distribution of magnetic field) can contribute to the
observed travel time variations. The travel time variations caused by the wave
interaction with magnetic field are in phase with the observations for strong
fields of 1400-1900 G if Doppler velocities are taken at the height of 300 km
above the photosphere where plasma parameter beta<<1. The simulations show that
the travel times only weakly depend on the height of velocity observation. For

discrepancy with the Standard Model, and comment on the direct CP asymmetries

important for the use of clusters for precision cosmology and for studies of
cluster physics. Previous attempts to measure robust temperatures at cluster
virial radii failed. Aims: The goal of this work is to measure the temperature
profile of the very relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2204 out to large radii,
possibly reaching the virial radius. Methods: Taking advantage of its low
particle background due to its low-Earth orbit, Suzaku data are used to measure
the outer temperature profile of Abell 2204. These data are combined with
Chandra and XMM-Newton data of the same cluster in order to make the connection
to the inner regions, unresolved by Suzaku, and to determine the smearing due
to Suzaku's PSF. Results: The temperature profile of Abell 2204 is determined
from 10 kpc to 1800 kpc, close to an estimate of r200 (the approximation to the
virial radius). The temperature rises steeply from below 4 keV in the very
center up to more than 8 keV in the intermediate range and then decreases again
to about 4 keV at the largest radii. Varying the measured particle background
normalization artificially by +-10 percent does not change the results
significantly. Predictions for outer temperature profiles based on hydrodynamic
simulations show good agreement. In particular, we find the observed
temperature profile to be slightly steeper but consistent with a drop of a
factor of 0.6 from 0.3 r200 to r200, as predicted by simulations. Conclusions:
Temperature measurements up to the virial radius seem feasible with Suzaku,
when a careful analysis of the different background components and the effects

  Games",,,,,"cs.GT cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article extends the idea of solving parity games by strategy iteration
to non-deterministic strategies: In a non-deterministic strategy a player
restricts himself to some non-empty subset of possible actions at a given node,
instead of limiting himself to exactly one action. We show that a
strategy-improvement algorithm by by Bjoerklund, Sandberg, and Vorobyov can
easily be adapted to the more general setting of non-deterministic strategies.
Further, we show that applying the heuristic of ""all profitable switches"" leads
to choosing a ""locally optimal"" successor strategy in the setting of
non-deterministic strategies, thereby obtaining an easy proof of an algorithm
by Schewe. In contrast to the algorithm by Bjoerklund et al., we present our
algorithm directly for parity games which allows us to compare it to the
algorithm by Jurdzinski and Voege: We show that the valuations used in both
algorithm coincide on parity game arenas in which one player can ""surrender"".
Thus, our algorithm can also be seen as a generalization of the one by
Jurdzinski and Voege to non-deterministic strategies. Finally, using
non-deterministic strategies allows us to show that the number of improvement
steps is bound from above by O(1.724^n). For strategy-improvement algorithms,
this bound was previously only known to be attainable by using randomization.

of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) employing the basic access
mechanism at the data link layer of IEEE 802.11 protocols. In order to broaden
the applicability of the proposed analysis, we consider general operating
conditions accounting for both non-saturated and saturated traffic in the
presence of transmission channel errors, as exemplified by the packet error
rate $P_e$.
  The main clue of this work stems from the relation that links the aggregate
throughput of the network to the packet rate $\lambda$ of the contending
stations. In particular, we show that the aggregate throughput $S(\lambda)$
presents two clearly distinct operating regions that depend on the actual value
of the packet rate $\lambda$ with respect to a critical value $\lambda_c$,
theoretically derived in this work.
  The behavior of $S(\lambda)$ paves the way to a cross-layer optimization
algorithm, which proved to be effective for maximizing the aggregate throughput
in a variety of network operating conditions. A nice consequence of the
proposed optimization framework relies on the fact that the aggregate
throughput can be predicted quite accurately with a simple, yet effective,
closed-form expression, which is also derived in the article.
  Finally, theoretical and simulation results are presented throughout the work
in order to unveil, as well as verify, the key ideas.

equations are integrated with a finite element method. A comparison between two
cases is performed. The first one corresponds to the classical situation of an
elastic homogeneous and isotropic half-space, which is traditionally used for
the generation of tsunamis. The second test case takes into account the
presence of a sediment layer separating the oceanic column from the hard rock.
Some important differences are revealed. We conjecture that deformations in the

model in combining information from different sources of information. This
method is particularly useful in small area problems. The variability of an
EBLUP is traditionally measured by the mean squared prediction error (MSPE),
and interval estimates are generally constructed using estimates of the MSPE.
Such methods have shortcomings like under-coverage or over-coverage, excessive
length and lack of interpretability. We propose a parametric bootstrap approach
to estimate the entire distribution of a suitably centered and scaled EBLUP.
The bootstrap histogram is highly accurate, and differs from the true EBLUP
distribution by only $O(d^3n^{-3/2})$, where $d$ is the number of parameters
and $n$ the number of observations. This result is used to obtain highly
accurate prediction intervals. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority
of this method over existing techniques of constructing prediction intervals in
linear mixed models.

may be sizable for practical measurement. Moreover, the BESIII will offer the
largest database on $J/\psi$ which makes more accurate measurements possible.
Furthermore, for such purely leptonic decays background is relatively low and

observing such processes from both theoretical and experimental aspects.

an extension of the model. Likely such extensions are that hard scatters probe
a denser matter distribution inside the proton in impact parameter space than
soft scatters, a conclusion also supported by Tevatron data on double-parton

the jets first travelled with constant velocity and then are slowed down by the
interactions between the jets and the interstellar medium (ISM). The best
fitted radius of the cavity is ~0.36 pc on the eastern side and ~0.46 pc on the
western side, and the densities also show asymmetry, of ~0.015 cm$^{-3}$ on the

galaxies, as well as to study the 2D cluster structure. The low values we
compute for the global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies (420-700
km/s) confirm that these clusters are low-mass clusters. Abell 610 shows a lot
of evidence of substructure. It seems to be formed by two structures separated
by about 700 km/s in the cluster rest-frame, having comparable velocity
dispersion (about 200 km/s) and likely causing a velocity gradient. The
analysis of the 2D galaxy distribution shows a bimodal distribution in the core
elongated in the SE-NW direction. Abell 725 and Abell 796, which are less
sampled, show marginal evidence of substructure in the velocity space. They are
elongated in the 2D galaxy distribution. For both Abell 610 and Abell 725 we
shortly discuss the possible connection with the hosted diffuse radio relic.
Our results show that relic radio sources are likely connected with merger
events,but are not limited to massive clusters. About the possible halo source
in Abell 796, there is some evidence of a merger event in this non-massive
cluster, but a pointed radio observation is necessary to confirm this halo.

developed using the order statistics derived from data depth. Specifically, the
spacing between two consecutive order statistics is the region which bridges
the two order statistics, in the sense that the region contains all the points
whose depth values fall between the depth values of the two consecutive order
statistics. These multivariate spacings can be viewed as a data-driven
realization of the so-called ``statistically equivalent blocks.'' These
spacings assume a form of center-outward layers of ``shells'' (``rings'' in the
two-dimensional case), where the shapes of the shells follow closely the
underlying probabilistic geometry. The properties and applications of these
spacings are studied. In particular, the spacings are used to construct
tolerance regions. The construction of tolerance regions is nonparametric and
completely data driven, and the resulting tolerance region reflects the true
geometry of the underlying distribution. This is different from most existing
approaches which require that the shape of the tolerance region be specified in
advance. The proposed tolerance regions are shown to meet the prescribed
specifications, in terms of $\beta$-content and $\beta$-expectation. They are
also asymptotically minimal under elliptical distributions. Finally, a
simulation and comparison study on the proposed tolerance regions is presented.

which have initially a triaxial configuration and are in equilibrium, we insert
to them central masses of various values. Immediately after such an insertion a
system presents a high fraction of particles moving in chaotic orbits, a fact
causing a secular evolution towards a new equilibrium state. The chaotic orbits
responsible for the secular evolution are identified. Their typical Lypaunov
exponents are found to scale with the central mass as a power law $L\propto
m^s$ with $s$ close to 1/2. The requirements for an effective secular evolution
within a Hubble time are examined. These requirements are quantified by
introducing a quantity called \emph{effective chaotic momentum} $\mathscr{L}$.
This quantity is found to correlate well with the rate of the systems' secular
evolution. In particular, we find that when $\mathscr{L}$ falls below a
threshold value (0.004 in our $N-$body units) a system does no longer exhibit
significant secular evolution.

same result in R^3 when K is a epsilon-minimal set, that is a generalization of
Reifenberg-flat sets with minimal cones of type Y and T. Moreover, the result
is still true for a further generalization of sets called (eps; eps_0)-minimal.
This article is a preliminary study for a forthcoming paper where a regularity

galaxies of the Fornax, Eridanus and Pegasus cluster, and NGC 7582 group.
  The structural parameters of the galaxies are derived from the R-band images
by performing a two-dimensional photometric decomposition of the
surface-brightness distribution. This is assumed to be the sum of the
contribution of a bulge and disc component characterized by elliptical and
concentric isophotes with constant (but possibly different) ellipticity and
position angles.
  The rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles are measured from the
spectra obtained along the major axis of galaxies. The radial profiles of the
Hb, Mg, and Fe line-strength indices are presented too. Correlations between
the central values of Mgd, <Fe>, Hb, and sigma are found.
  The age, metallicity and alpha/Fe enhancement of the stellar population in
the center and at the radius where bulge and disc give the same contribution to
the total surface brightness are obtained using stellar population models with
variable element abundance ratios.
  Three classes of bulges are identified. The youngest bulges (~2 Gyr) with
ongoing star formation, intermediate-age bulges (4-8 Gyr) have solar
metallicity, and old bulges (~10 Gyr) have high metallicity.
  Most of the sample bulges display solar alpha/Fe enhancement, no gradient in
age, and a negative gradient of metallicity. The presence of negative gradient
in the metallicity radial profile favors a scenario with bulge formation via
dissipative collapse. (abridged)

and the consequential crash and investigate how their proximate triggering
factor might relate to their fundamental mechanism, and vice versa. Our agents
invest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on
three sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)
information from their ""friendship"" network and (iii) private information. Our
bounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the
current market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in
their trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find
that bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due
to a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a
transient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the
price has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,
which brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients
provide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial
markets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current
market regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.
A positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms
(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles
and crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite
(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a
single framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the
distribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are
qualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.

in an expanding Universe with constant effective potential, there is a critical
value (k_c) of the comoving wave-number which discriminates the metric
perturbations into oscillating (k > k_c) and non-oscillating (k < k_c) modes.
As a consequence, if the non-oscillatory modes are outside the horizon they do
not freeze out. The effective potential is reduced to a non-vanishing constant
in a cosmological model which is driven by a two-component fluid, consisting of
radiation (dominant) and cosmic strings (sub-dominant). It is known that the
cosmological evolution gradually results in the scaling of a cosmic-string
network and, therefore, after some time (\Dl \ta) the Universe becomes
radiation-dominated. The evolution of the non-oscillatory GW modes during \Dl
\ta (while they were outside the horizon), results in the distortion of the GW
power spectrum from what it is anticipated in a pure radiation-model, at

data to measure an average gas-to-dust mass ratio of 120 +/- 28 (rms deviation
109) in the central regions of these galaxies, very similar to the value of 150
determined for the Milky Way. This similarity is interesting given the more
intense heating from the starburst and possibly accretion activity in the
luminous infrared galaxies compared to the Milky Way. We find that the peak H_2
surface density correlates with the far-infrared luminosity, which suggests
that galaxies with higher gas surface densities inside the central kiloparsec
have a higher star formation rate. The lack of a significant correlation
between total H_2 mass and far-infrared luminosity in our sample suggests that
the increased star formation rate is due to the increased availability of
molecular gas as fuel for star formation in the central regions. In contrast to
previous analyses by other authors, we do not find a significant correlation
between central gas surface density and the star formation efficiency, as trace
by the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to nuclear gas mass. Our data show that
it is the star formation rate, not the star formation efficiency, that

based upon radial velocities from the IUE spectra and use the orbital solutions
with a Doppler tomography algorithm to reconstruct the components' UV spectra.
The subdwarf is hot (T_eff = 45+/-5 kK) and has a mass of about 1.3 M_sun and a
radius of about 0.6 R_sun. It contributes about 4% as much flux as the Be star
does in the FUV. We also present observations of the H-alpha and He I 6678
emission features that are formed in the circumstellar disk of the Be star.
Orbital flux and velocity variations in the He I 6678 profile indicate that
much of the emission forms along the disk rim facing the hot subdwarf where the
disk is probably heated by the incident radiation from the subdwarf. A study of
the FUV infall shell lines discovered in the 1980s confirms their episodic
presence but reveals that they tend to be found around both quadrature phases,
unlike the pattern in Algol binaries. Phase-dependent variations in the UV N V

recession velocities and distances of galaxies. While the conversion of
observed velocities into true recession velocities has only a small effect on
the result, the derivation of unbiased distances which rest on a solid zero
point and cover a useful range of about 4-30 Mpc is crucial. A list of 279 such
galaxy distances within v<2000 km/s is given which are derived from the tip of
the red-giant branch (TRGB), from Cepheids, and from supernovae of type Ia (SNe
Ia). Their random errors are not more than 0.15 mag as shown by
intercomparison. They trace a linear expansion field within narrow margins from
v=250 to at least 2000 km/s. Additional 62 distant SNe Ia confirm the linearity
to at least 20,000 km/s. The dispersion about the Hubble line is dominated by
random peculiar velocities, amounting locally to <100 km/s but increasing
outwards. Due to the linearity of the expansion field the Hubble constant H_0
can be found at any distance >4.5 Mpc. RR Lyr star-calibrated TRGB distances of
78 galaxies above this limit give H_0=63.0+/-1.6 at an effective distance of 6
Mpc. They compensate the effect of peculiar motions by their large number.
Support for this result comes from 28 independently calibrated Cepheids that
give H_0=63.4+/-1.7 at 15 Mpc. This agrees also with the large-scale value of
H_0=61.2+/-0.5 from the distant, Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia. A mean value of
H_0=62.3+/-1.3 is adopted. Because the value depends on two independent zero
points of the distance scale its systematic error is estimated to be 6%.
Typical errors of H_0 come from the use of a universal, yet unjustified P-L
relation of Cepheids, the neglect of selection bias in magnitude-limited
samples, or they are inherent to the adopted models.

generates a dependent (spin) percolation model with parameter $r$. We show
that, on the triangular lattice and for $\beta<\beta_c$, this model has a
percolation phase transition at $r=1/2$, corresponding to the Ising model. This
sheds some light on the conjecture that the high temperature Ising model on the

GHz-detected sources follow the L_{FIR}--L_{bol} relationship derived from a
sample of local IR luminous quasars (L_{IR}>10^{12}L_{\odot}), while the
average L_{FIR}/L_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that of

weaker Ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. We discuss possible FIR

formation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. The average star formation

Specifically, the problem of distributed phase alignment is considered, where
neither the transmitters nor the receiver has perfect channel state
information, but there is a low-rate feedback link from the receiver to the
transmitters. In this setting, a framework is proposed for systematically
analyzing the performance of distributed beamforming schemes. To illustrate the
advantage of this framework, a simple adaptive distributed beamforming scheme
that was recently proposed by Mudambai et al. is studied. Two important
properties for the received signal magnitude function are derived. Using these
properties and the systematic framework, it is shown that the adaptive
distributed beamforming scheme converges both in probability and in mean.
Furthermore, it is established that the time required for the adaptive scheme
to converge in mean scales linearly with respect to the number of sensor/relay
nodes.

Colombeau solutions to Einstein field equations is obtained. The vacuum energy
density of free scalar quantum field ${\Phi}$ with a distributional background
spacetime also is considered.It has been widely believed that, except in very
extreme situations, the influence of acceleration on quantum fields should
amount to just small, sub-dominant contributions. Here we argue that this
belief is wrong by showing that in a Rindler distributional background
spacetime with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection the vacuum energy of
free quantum fields is forced, by the very same background distributional
space-time such a Rindler distributional background space-time, to become
dominant over any classical energy density component.This semiclassical gravity
effect finds its roots in the singular behavior of quantum fields on a Rindler
distributional space-times with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection. In
particular we obtain that the vacuum fluctuations $<{\Phi}^2({\delta})>$ have a
singular behavior at a Rindler horizon $\delta = 0$.Therefore sufficiently
strongly accelerated observer burns up near the Rindler horizon. Thus
Polchinski account does not violate of the Einstein equivalence principle.

  flux","20 pages, 5 figures, uses revtex4",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Even after the negative result by the MiniBooNE experiment, we can still have
a (3+1)-scheme with one sterile neutrino whose mixing lies within the allowed
region by MiniBooNE. In this note we discuss the possible effects of such a
scheme on the flavor ratio of high-energy cosmic neutrinos from cosmologically
distant astrophysical sources. It is shown that in principle there is still a
chance to observe deviation from the standard three flavor scenario in the
flavor ratio of the high-energy cosmic neutrinos. It is proposed to see the
energy spectrum to cope with the theoretical uncertainties which were recently
pointed out by Lipari, Lusignoli and Meloni. It is emphasized that the
$\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau$ ratio is relatively insensitive to the theoretical
uncertainties and therefore this ratio is the key ingredient to look for the
signatures of the sterile neutrino scheme. Although the statistics of data from
one source in the next generation of neutrino telescopes are estimated not to
be sufficient to distinguish the three and four family schemes, if we can gain
statistics by, e.g., summing over data from many sources, then it might be
possible to have a signature for the (3+1)-scheme.

water after its release from a capillary tube. Both pure heptane drops and
diluted crude oil drops are considered (in the second case the interface is
covered by amphiphilic species, natural components of crude oil). Shadowgraph
images of the drops are taken by means of a high speed camera and the drop
contour is detected by image processing. The axisymmetric drop shape is then
decomposed into spherical harmonics, which constitute the eigenmodes of
oscillations predicted by the Rayleigh-Lamb theory. Time evolution of each mode
is then obtained. The frequency and the damping rate of the principal mode
(n=2) are accurately determined and compared with theoretical values for an
immobile clean drop oscillating around spherical shape. For pure heptane drops,
theoretical value of the frequency agrees well with experiments whereas the
damping rate is significantly underestimated by theory. The experimental
results clearly show that the different modes are coupled. Energy is thus
transfered from mode n=2 to n=3, which probably explains the observed
enhancement of the damping rate. The effect of the interface viscoelastic
behaviour, induced by adsorbed amphiphilic species on the free oscillations was
examined. No significant effect was observed in the experiments conditions
(small amplitude oscillations and moderate aging).

proposed. It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept and on the
principle of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each
enterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local
and global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual
Enterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of
tiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner
constitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers.
Exchanges between the VENs ensure the autonomy of decision, and guarantiee the
consistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN
agents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA)
and one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If
supply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier
Negotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain
Mediator Agent (SCMA) working at the level of the enterprise network. These two
agents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs
process the flow of information alone. With this new approach, managing
enterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a
simple enterprise in the network. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows
physical distribution of the decisional system, and procures a heterarchical
organization structure with a decentralized control that guaranties the
autonomy of each entity and the flexibility of the network.

used of multi-agent concept. Each entity (like enterprise) is autonomous and
must perform local and global goals in relation with its environment. The base
component of our approach is a Virtual Enterprise Node (VEN). The supply chain
is viewed as a set of tiers (corresponding to the levels of production), in
which each partner of the supply chain (VEN) is in relation with several
customers and suppliers. Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives
global objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The Mediator
Agent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those
objectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to Negotiator
Agent at the tier level (NAT). These two agents are only active if a
perturbation occurs; otherwise information flows are only exchange between
VENs. This architecture allows supply chains management which is completely
transparent seen from simple enterprise of the supply chain. The used of
Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows physical distribution of the decisional system.
Moreover, the hierarchical organizational structure with a decentralized
control guaranties, in the same time, the autonomy of each entity and the whole

of wetting by the isotropic phase, the anchoring transition may interact with
the capillary isotropic-nematic transition in interesting ways. For general
anchoring conditions on this surface we confirm the existence of the step-tilt,
biaxial phase and the associated transition to the linear,
constant-tilt-rotation, configuration. The step-like phase is connected with
the bulk isotropic phase for increasing film thickness so that the latter
transition is to be interpreted as the capillary isotropic-nematic transition.
Finally, we suggest possible global surface phase diagrams.
