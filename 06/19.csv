show that electronic Green's function is fully determined by closed recursive
expressions that take the form of a high magnetic field expansion in powers of
the magnetic length l_B. For illustration we determine entirely Green's
function at order l_B^3, which is then used to obtain quantum expressions for
the local charge and current electronic densities at equilibrium. Such results
are valid at high but finite magnetic fields and for arbitrary temperatures, as
they take into account Landau level mixing processes and wave function
broadening. We also check the accuracy of our general functionals against the
exact solution of a one-dimensional parabolic confining potential,
demonstrating the controlled character of the theory to get equilibrium
properties. Finally, we show that transport in high magnetic fields can be
described hydrodynamically by a local equilibrium regime and that dissipation
mechanisms and quantum tunneling processes are intrinsically included at the
microscopic level in our high magnetic field theory. We calculate microscopic
expressions for the local conductivity tensor, which possesses both transverse

understanding of dissipative features in quantum Hall systems.

vacuum fluctuations of matter fields and critically assess the usual assertion
that vacuum energy implies a Planckian cosmological constant. A new stochastic
classical approach to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime is developed. The
work extends conceptually Boyer's random electrodynamics to a theory of random
gravity but has a considerably richer structure for inheriting nonlinearity
from general relativity. Attention is drawn to subtleties in choosing boundary
conditions for metric fluctuations in relation to their dynamical consequences.
Those compatible with the observed Lorentz invariance must allow for
spontaneous conformal fluctuations, in addition to stochastic gravitational
waves due to zero point gravitons. This is implemented through an effective
metric defined in terms of the random spacetime metric modulo a fluctuating
conformal factor. It satisfies an effective Einstein equation coupled to an
effective stress-energy tensor incorporating gravitational self energy of
metric fluctuations as well as matter fields. The effective Einstein equation
is expanded up to second order nonlinearity. A UV-cutoff is introduced whose
specific value, however, does not enter into the resulting description of
random gravity. The averaged effective metric satisfies the empty space
Einstein equation with an effective cosmological constant. This vanishes when
only the massless matter fields are included. More generally, a finite
effective cosmological constant compatible with the observational constraints
can be obtained as long as the bare masses of the massive matter fields are
nearly zero, or the conformal invariance of matter is restored at some high
energy scale.

from the location of approximately 70% of the polar X-ray (Hinode/XRT) and EUV
jets, with the plume haze appearing minutes to hours after the jet was
observed. The remaining jets occurred in areas where plume material previously
existed causing a brightness enhancement of the latter after the jet event.
Short-lived, jet-like events and small transient bright points are seen (one at
a time) at different locations within the base of pre-existing long-lived
plumes. X-ray images also show instances (at least two events) of
collimated-thin jets rapidly evolving into significantly wider plume-like
structures that are followed by the delayed appearance of plume haze in the

polar plumes, and in some cases cause brightenings of plumes. Possible

within a post-Newtonian external spacetime. The tidal perturbation created by
the external environment is treated as a small perturbation. At a large
distance from the black hole, the gravitational field of the external
distribution of matter is assumed to be sufficiently weak to be adequately
described by the (first) post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity.
There, the black hole is treated as a monopole contribution to the total
gravitational field. There exists an overlap in the domains of validity of each
description, and the black-hole and post-Newtonian metrics are matched in the
overlap. The matching procedure produces the equations of motion for the black
hole and the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tidal fields acting on the
black hole. We first calculate the equations of motion and tidal fields by
making no assumptions regarding the nature of the post-Newtonian environment;
this could contain a continuous distribution of matter or any number of
condensed bodies. We next specialize our discussion to a situation in which the

symmetric flows driven by young massive stellar clusters with a central
supermassive black hole. We demonstrate that the hydrodynamic regime of the
flow depends on the location of the cluster in the 3D (star cluster mechanical
luminosity - BH mass - star cluster radius) parameter space. We show that a
threshold mechanical luminosity (L_crit) separates clusters which evolve in the
BH dominated regime frome those whose internal structure is strongly affected
by the radiative cooling. In the first case(below the threshold energy) gravity
of the BH separates the flow into two distinct zones: the inner accretion zone
and the outer zone where the star cluster wind is formed. In the second case
(above the critical luminosity), catastrophic cooling sets in inside the
cluster. In this case the injected plasma becomes thermally unstable that
inhibits a complete stationary solution. We compared the calculated accretion
rates and the BH luminosities with those predicted by the classic Bondi
accretion theory and found that Bondi's theory is in good agreement with our
results in the case of low mass clusters. However, it substantially
underestimates the accretion rates and BH luminosities if the star cluster
mechanical luminosity, L_sc, approaches the threshold value (L_sc > 0.1

based on the energy principle show that such heating is caused by non-resonant
response of electron spins in the unfilled 3d shell to the wave magnetic field.
Small spin reorientation thus generated leads to a large internal energy change
through the exchange interactions between spins, which becomes maximal around $
T_{c} $ for magnetite $ {\rm Fe}_{3}{\rm O}_{4} $. The dissipative spin
dynamics simulation yields the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility,
which becomes largest around $ T_{c} $ and for the microwave frequency around 2
GHz. Hematite $ {\rm Fe}_{2}{\rm O}_{3} $ with weak spontaneous magnetization
responds much less to microwaves as observed in experiments. The heating of
titanium oxide by microwave magnetic field only when oxygen defects are present

These results are compared with those obtained from an accurate analysis based
on the reaction coordinate folding probability Pfold, and on structural
clustering methods. For both protein models, the transition state ensemble is
rather heterogeneous and splits-up into structurally different populations. For
the more complex geometry the identified subpopulations are actually
structurally disjoint. For the less complex native geometry we found a broad
transition state with microscopic heterogeneity. For both geometries, the
identification of the folding nucleus via the Pfold analysis agrees with the
identification of the folding nucleus carried out with the phi-value analysis.
For the most complex geometry, however, the apllied methodologies give more
consistent results than for the more local geometry. The study of the
transition state' structure reveals that the nucleus residues are not
necessarily fully native in the transition state. Indeed, it is only for the
more complex geometry that two of the five critical residues show a
considerably high probability of having all its native bonds formed in the
transition state. Therefore, one concludes that in general the phi-value
correlates with the acceleration/deceleration of folding induced by mutation,
rather than with the degree of nativeness of the transition state, and that the
traditional interpretation of phi-values may provide a more realistic picture
of the structure of the transition state only for more complex native
geometries.

waves interferometric detectors, where the thermal noise of the test masses is

  We provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of non-Gaussian beams on
different kinds of thermal noises. We developed the theory of mesa beam, in
view of a future implementation in advanced GW interferometers of the mesa beam
idea, focusing on the analytical derivation of the quantities (i.e. beam width,
divergence, propagation factor), which are chosen as ISO standard reference
parameters for the characterization of an optical beam. We also analytically
proved a new duality relation between optical cavities with non-spherical
mirrors. The interest of the GW community in this new beam technology led us to
the construction and testing of a prototype mesa beam Fabry-Perot cavity with
Mexican-hat mirror. Part of the work of this thesis was devoted to the
development of new simulation programs of optical systems. These programs
provided the theoretical expected behaviour of our experiment, in particular
cavity modes structure and misalignments sensitivity to be confronted with the
experimental results. We also explored another complementary way of reducing
the mirror thermal noise, beside the beam shaping, that is the multi-layered
coating thickness optimization. We show it to be effective in reducing the
coating noise and explore the possible implications for GW interferometers in
terms of sensitivity. During this analysis we developed an independent model
for the coating effective elastic parameters, which is based on the well
understood subject of homogenization theory.

estimate the success rate of retrieving each individual candidate as a function
of its redshift, the emission redshift of the quasar, the strength of the
absorber and the measured S/N of the spectrum by modelling typical Ly forest

contribution of OVI to the closure mass density at the redshifts probed here:
$\Omega _{OVI} (2.8 < z < 3.2) >1.9x10^{-8} h^-1. We show that the strong lines

Cluster HI-rich pair NGC 4532/DDO 137, detected as part of the Arecibo Legacy
Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey. The feature is the longest and most massive HI tail
structure so far found in the Virgo Cluster and, at 1.8 Mpc from M87, the most
distant from the main concentration of the intracluster medium. The structure
is spatially and spectrally separated into two ridges and is defined by diffuse
emission and discrete clumps of mass 2.5 - 6.8 x 10**7 solar masses. All
emission is blue-shifted with respect to the NGC 4532/DDO 137 pair emission.
Including diffuse emission, the structure has a total mass of up to 7 x 10**8
solar masses, equivalent to ~10% of the system's HI mass. Optical R-band
imaging finds no counterparts to a level of 26.5 mag arcsec**-2. The
characteristics of the structure appear most consistent with a tidal origin.

conditional CMB power spectrum sampling algorithm that allows for different
binning schemes for each power spectrum. This is useful because most CMB

densities of the lines in the Ly-alpha forest, on the basis of simple

carefully determined the redshifts of the QSOs in our sample and modelled in

density field obtained from the observed spectra shows a significant
over-density in the region within 4 proper Mpc from the QSO position,
confirming that QSOs are hosted in high density peaks. The absolute value of
rho/<rho> for the peak is uncertain by a factor of ~3, depending on the assumed
QSO spectral slope and the minimum HI column density detectable in the spectra.
We do not confirm the presence of a significant over-density extending to

detected at its faintest level of radio and X-ray emission with a 0.5-10 keV
unabsorbed luminosity of 8.3 x 10^32 (d/3.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. The X-ray spectrum
fit with an absorbed power-law model yields a photon index of 2.17 +/- 0.13.
Contrary to previous findings, this clearly indicates that V404 Cyg undergoes -
like most black holes in quiescence - a softening of its X-ray spectrum at very
low luminosity compared to the standard hard state. The quiescent radio
emission is consistent with the presence of self-absorbed compact jets. We have
also reanalyzed archival data from the decay of the 1989 outburst of V404 Cyg
in order to quantify more precisely the correlation between radio and X-ray
emission in the hard state of V404 Cyg. We show that this correlation extends
over five decades in X-ray flux and holds down to the quiescent state of V404
Cyg. The index of this correlation (~0.5) may suggest that synchrotron
self-Compton emission is the dominant physical process at high energy in V404
Cyg. However, this index is also consistent with scale invariant jet models
coupled to an inefficiently radiating accretion disc. We discuss the properties
of the quiescent state of black holes and highlight the fact that some of their

observations are inconsistent with neutrino masses ranging from 2 - 7 eV, and

ring-like structure within 100 AU of T Tau N. We present evidence to show that
the emission most likely arises from shocks in the atmosphere of a nearly
face-on disk around T Tau N. Using high spatial resolution 3D spectroscopic
K-band data, we trace the spatial distribution of several H2 NIR rovibrational
lines in the vicinity of T Tau N. We detect weak H2 emission from the v=1-0
S(0), S(1), Q(1) lines and the v=2-1 S(1) line in a ring-like structure around
T Tau N between 0.1'' (~15 AU) and 0.7'' (~100AU) from the star. The v=1-0 S(0)
and v=2-1 S(1) lines are detected only in the outer parts of the ring
structure. Closer to the star, the strong continuum limits our sensitivity to
these lines. The total flux of the v=1-0 S(1) line is 1.8 *10^{-14} ergs
s^{-1}cm^{-2}, similar to previous measurements of H2 in circumstellar disks.
The velocity of the H2 emitting gas around T Tau N is consistent with the rest
velocity of the star, and the H2 does not seem to be part of a collimated
outflow. Both shocks impinging on the surface of a disk and irradiation of a
disk by UV-photons and X-rays from the central star are plausible candidates
for the H2 excitation mechanism. However, irradiation should not create a large
degree of excitation at radii larger than 20 AU. Most likely the H2 emission
arises in the atmosphere of a flared disk with radius 85-100 AU and mass
0.005-0.5Msun, where the gas is excited by shocks created when a wide-angle
wind impinges on the disk. The H2 emission could also originate from shock
excitation in the cavity walls of an envelope, but this requires an unusually
high velocity of the wide-angle wind from T Tau N.

its basic physical properties--radius, temperature, luminosity--and how those
properties evolve with time. Thus, two stars born at the same time, from the
same natal material, and with the same mass are 'identical twins,' and as such
might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered
in the Orion Nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system.
Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to
within 2 percent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface
temperatures that differ by ~300K (~10%), and luminosities that differ by ~50%,
both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars'
radii also differ, by 5-10%. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one
of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its
formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected
in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system3 such as that reported
here. Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronisation of young
binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation

relevant case needs the presence of both particles and anti-particles, and that
it corresponds to models in which the bosonic particle is very light. Contrary
to common wisdom, the condensate should be a relativistic phenomenon. Some
cosmological implications are discussed in turn.

parameters most notably the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and is sensitive to
parameters which govern the growth of large scale structure (LSS) and evolution
of the gravitational potential. The primordial gravitational-wave- and
secondary lensing-induced B-mode signals are very weak and therefore prone to
various foregrounds and systematics. In this work we use Fisher-matrix-based
estimations and apply, for the first time, Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
simulations to determine the effect of beam systematics on the inferred
cosmological parameters from five upcoming experiments: PLANCK, POLARBEAR,
SPIDER, QUIET+CLOVER and CMBPOL. We consider beam systematics which couple the
beam substructure to the gradient of temperature anisotropy and polarization
(differential beamwidth, pointing and ellipticity) and beam systematics due to
differential beam normalization (differential gain) and orientation (beam
rotation) of the polarization-sensitive axes (the latter two effects are
insensitive to the beam substructure). We determine allowable levels of beam
systematics for given tolerances on the induced parameter errors and check for
possible biases in the inferred parameters concomitant with potential increases
in the statistical uncertainty. All our results are scaled to the 'worst case
scenario'. In this case and for our tolerance levels, the beam rotation should
not exceed the few-degree to sub-degree level, typical ellipticity is required
to be 1% level, the differential gain allowed level is a few parts in $10^{3}$
to $10^{4}$, differential beamwidth upper limits are of the sub-percent level
and differential pointing should not exceed the few- to sub-arcsec level.

explore the degree of overlap between 1200-micron- and 850-micron-selected

annihilation that was going on in the early Universe. Of all the particles that
could be generated by this process we consider only photons, as they are both
uncharged and easily detectable. The earlier the Universe was, the higher the
dark matter concentration $n$ and the annihilation rate (proportional to $n^2$)
were. However, the emission from the very early Universe cannot reach us
because of the opacity. The main part of the signal was generated at the moment
the Universe had just become transparent for the photons produced by the
annihilation. Thus, the dark matter annihilation in the early Universe should
have created a sort of relic emission. We obtain its flux and the spectrum.
  If weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) constitute dark matter, it is
shown that we may expect an extragalactic gamma-ray signal in the energy range
0.5 - 20 {MeV} with a maximum near 8 {MeV}. We show that an experimentally
observed excess in the gamma-ray background at 0.5 - 20 {MeV} could be created
by the relic WIMPs annihilation only if the dark matter structures in the
universe had appeared before the universe became transparent for the
annihilation products ($z \simeq 300$). We discuss in more detail physical
conditions whereby this interpretation could be possible.

with a special emphasis on the question of higher-order perturbative
corrections and different possibilities of resumming the perturbative series
with the renormalisation group: fixed-order (FOPT) vs. contour-improved
perturbation theory (CIPT). The difference between these approaches has evolved
into a systematic effect that does not go away as higher orders in the
perturbative expansion are added. We attempt to clarify under which
circumstances one or the other approach provides a better approximation to the
true result. To this end, we propose to describe the Adler function series by a
model that includes the exactly known coefficients and theoretical constraints
on the large-order behaviour originating from the operator product expansion
and the renormalisation group. Within this framework we find that while CIPT is
unable to account for the fully resummed series, FOPT smoothly approaches the
Borel sum, before the expected divergent behaviour sets in at even higher
orders. Employing FOPT up to the fifth order to determine $\alpha_s$ in the
$\MSb$ scheme, we obtain $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.320 {}^{+0.012}_{-0.007}$,
corresponding to $\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1185 {}^{+0.0014}_{-0.0009}$. Improving
this result by including yet higher orders from our model yields
$\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.316 \pm 0.006$, which after evolution leads to
$\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 \pm 0.0008$. Our results are lower than previous values

demanding a non-equilibrium entropy balance law dS = dQ/T + dS_i hold for all
local acceleration horizons through each point in spacetime. The entropy change
dS is proportional to the change in horizon area while dQ and T are the energy
flux across the horizon and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerating observer
just inside the horizon. The internal entropy production term dS_i is
proportional to the squared shear of the horizon and the ratio of the
proportionality constant to the area entropy density is \hbar/4\pi. Here we
will show that this derivation can be reformulated in the language of
hydrodynamics. We postulate that the vacuum thermal state in the Rindler wedge
of spacetime obeys the holographic principle. Hydrodynamic perturbations of
this state exist and are manifested in the dynamics of a stretched horizon
fluid at the horizon boundary. Using the equations of hydrodynamics we derive
the entropy balance law and show the Einstein equation is a consequence of
vacuum hydrodynamics. This result implies that \hbar/4\pi is the shear
viscosity to entropy density ratio of the local vacuum thermal state. The value
\hbar/4\pi has attracted much attention as the shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio for all gauge theories with an Einstein gravity dual. It has also
been conjectured as the universal lower bound on the ratio. We argue that our
picture of the vacuum thermal state is consistent with the physics of the
gauge/gravity dualities and then consider possible applications to open
questions.

simulated one year long observations of four 30 GHz detectors. The simulated
timestreams contained CMB, foreground components (both galactic and
extra-galactic), instrument noise (correlated and white), and the four
instrument systematic effects. We made maps from the timelines and examined the
magnitudes of the systematics effects in the maps and their angular power
spectra. We also compared the maps of different mapmaking codes to see how they
performed. We used five mapmaking codes (two destripers and three optimal
codes). None of our mapmaking codes makes an attempt to deconvolve the beam
from its output map. Therefore all our maps had similar smoothing due to beams
and sample integration. Temperature to polarization cross-coupling due to beam
mismatch causes a detectable bias in the TE spectrum of the CMB map. The
effects of cooler noise and pointing errors did not appear to be major concerns
for the 30 GHz channel. The only essential difference found so far between
mapmaking codes that affects accuracy (in terms of residual RMS) is baseline
length. All optimal codes give essentially indistinguishable results. A
destriper gives the same result as the optimal codes when the baseline is set
short enough. For longer baselines destripers require less computing resources
but deliver a noisier map.

  Fluids",,"10.1063/1.2957022",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study is concerned with the decay behaviour of a passive scalar $\theta$
in three-dimensional flows having bounded velocity gradients. Given an
initially smooth scalar distribution, the decay rate $d<\theta^2>/dt$ of the
scalar variance $<\theta^2>$ is found to be bounded in terms of controlled
physical parameters. Furthermore, in the zero diffusivity limit, $\kappa\to0$,
this rate vanishes as $\kappa^{\alpha_0}$ if there exists an $\alpha_0\in(0,1]$
independent of $\kappa$ such that $<|(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}\theta|^2><\infty$ for
$\alpha\le\alpha_0$. This condition is satisfied if in the limit $\kappa\to0$,
the variance spectrum $\Theta(k)$ remains steeper than $k^{-1}$ for large wave
numbers $k$. When no such positive $\alpha_0$ exists, the scalar field may be
said to become virtually singular. A plausible scenario consistent with
Batchelor's theory is that $\Theta(k)$ becomes increasingly shallower for
smaller $\kappa$, approaching the Batchelor scaling $k^{-1}$ in the limit
$\kappa\to0$. For this classical case, the decay rate also vanishes, albeit
more slowly -- like $(\ln P_r)^{-1}$, where $P_r$ is the Prandtl or Schmidt
number. Hence, diffusion anomaly is ruled out for a broad range of scalar
distribution, including power-law spectra no shallower than $k^{-1}$. The
implication is that in order to have a $\kappa$-independent and non-vanishing
decay rate, the variance at small scales must necessarily be greater than that
allowed by the Batchelor spectrum. These results are discussed in the light of
existing literature on the asymptotic exponential decay $<\theta^2>\sim
e^{-\gamma t}$, where $\gamma>0$ is independent of $\kappa$.

1969 and studied extensively, there are no significant results on lower bounds
for boxicity. In this paper, we develop two general methods for deriving lower
bounds. Applying these methods we give several results, some of which are
listed below:
  (1) The boxicity of a graph on $n$ vertices with no universal vertices and
minimum degree $\delta$ is at least $n/2(n-\delta-1)$. (2) Consider the
$\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ model of random graphs. Let $ p \le 1- \frac{40 \log

$box(G)=\Omega(np(1-p))$. On setting $p=1/2$ we immediately infer that almost
all graphs have boxicity $\Omega(n)$. (3) Spectral lower bounds for the
boxicity of $k$-regular graphs. (4) The boxicity of random $k$-regular graphs
on $n$ vertices (where $k$ is fixed) is $\Omega(k/\log k)$. (5) There exists a
positive constant$c$ such that almost all balanced bipartite graphs on $2n$

superposition and thinning as well as independent, identically distributed

degenerate vacua at some high energy scale $\Lambda$ caused by the MPP can
result in approximate U(1) and Z(2) symmetries that suppress FCNC and
CP--violating interactions in the 2HDM. We explore the renormalisation group
(RG) flow of the Yukawa and Higgs couplings within the MPP inspired 2HDM with
approximate custodial symmetries and show that the solutions of the RG
equations are focused near quasi--fixed points at low energies if the MPP scale

near the quasi--fixed point at moderate values of $\tan\beta$ and compute a
theoretical upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass. If $\Lambda\gtrsim
10^{10} {GeV}$ the lightest CP--even Higgs boson is always lighter than $125
{GeV}$. When the MPP scale is low, the mass of the lightest Higgs particle can
reach $180-220 {GeV}$ while its coupling to the top quark can be significantly
larger than in the SM, resulting in the enhanced production of Higgs bosons at

on the wavenumber index k. The mathematically impossible consequences can be
overcome if the periodic part of the electron wavefunction is represented as
un(r), which is dependent only on the band index, n, and is independent of the

the Bloch theorem and with all other properties of Bloch wavefunctions. The
correct form is also consistent with the Born-von Karman periodic boundary

less evolved into stars than high mass galaxies. There are strong variations in
the H-alpha to UV flux ratios within and between galaxies. The only plausible

latter interpretation, although either result has major implications for
astrophysics. A detailed dissection of the massive star content in the extended

  Our study suggests that the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of
neutral gaseous structures whose high column density tail represents the
population of common HI high-velocity clouds seen in 21 cm surveys. The CaII
column density distribution follows a power-law which is comparable to the
distribution found for intervening metal-line systems toward QSOs. Many of the
statistical and physical properties of the CaII absorbers resemble those of
strong MgII absorbing systems observed in the circumgalactic environment of
other galaxies, suggesting that both absorber populations may be closely

the presence of photospheric HeI absorption lines. In our high-resolution
optical spectra from 2000, however, we could not identify any HeI line. The
observed changes in spectral behaviour of S23 lead to different spectral
classifications at different observing epochs. The aim of this research is,
therefore, to find and discuss possible scenarios that might cause a
disappearance of the photospheric HeI absorption lines within a period of only
11 years. From our high-resolution optical spectra, we perform a detailed
investigation of the different spectral appearances of S23. We further
determine the projected rotational velocities of S23 in the two epochs of
observations. Based on its spectral appearance in 2000, we classify S23 as A1Ib
star with an effective temperature of about 9000 K. Further, an interstellar
extinction value of E(B-V) = 0.03 is derived. This is considerably lower than
the previously published value, which means that, if the circumstellar
extinction due to the stellar wind is neglected, the interstellar extinction,
and hence the luminosity of the star, are overestimated. We derive a rotation
velocity of v sin i = 150km/s, which means that S23 is rotating with about 75%
of its critical speed. The object S23 is thus the fourth B[e] supergiant with
confirmed high projected rotational velocity. The most striking result is the
apparent cooling of S23 by more than 1500 K with a simultaneous increase of its
rotation speed by about 35% within only 11 years. Since such a behaviour is
excluded by stellar evolution theories, we discuss possible scenarios for the
observed peculiar variations in S23.

In this paper, we first prove some properties related to highly connected
graph. Based on these properties, we then redefine the highly connected
subgraph which results in an algorithm that determines whether a given graph is
highly connected in linear time. Then we present a computationally efficient
algorithm, called MOHCS, for mining overlapping highly connected subgraphs. We

perform a detailed comparison with results from recent stellar evolutionary
models. uvby light curves and standard photometry were obtained at ESO,radial
velocity observations at CfA facilities, and high-resolution spectra with ESO's
FEROS spectrograph. State-of-the-art methods were applied for the analyses.
Masses and radii that are precise to 0.5-0.7% and 0.4-0.9%, respectively, have
been established for the components, which span the ranges of 1.1 to 1.4 M_sun
and 1.1 to 1.6 R_sun. The [Fe/H] abundances are from -0.27 to +0.10, with
uncertainties between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. We find indications of a slight
alpha-element overabundance of [alpha/Fe] ~ +0.1$ for WZ Oph. The secondary
component of AD Boo and both components of WZ Oph appear to be slightly active.
Yale-Yonsai and Victoria-Regina evolutionary models fit the components of AD
Boo and VZ Hya almost equally well, assuming coeval formation, at ages of about
1.75/1.50 Gyr (AD Boo) and 1.25/1.00 Gyr (VZ Hya). BaSTI models, however,
predict somewhat different ages for the primary and secondary components. For
WZ Oph, the models from all three grids are significantly hotter than observed.
A low He content, decreased envelope convection coupled with surface activity,
and/or higher interstellar absorption would remove the discrepancy, but its
cause has not been definitively identified. We have demonstrated the power of
testing and comparing recent stellar evolutionary models using eclipsing
binaries, provided their abundances are known. The strongest limitations and
challenges are set by T_eff and interstellar absorption determinations, and by
their effects on and correlation with abundance results.

Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs) with energies above 56 EeV and well determined
arrival directions as of 2007 August 31. They find that the arrival directions
are not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby
AGNs. Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their
arrival directions with more comprehensive source catalogs.
  Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy >56EeV detected by the Pierre Auger
Observatory have arrival directions within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of the extended
(>180kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BLLac
with extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six)
of all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of a
UHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower
exposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a
subset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9% level. This is the first direct
observational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. For
the remaining ~20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high
significance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27
UHECRs and AGNs in the Veron-Cetty & Veron catalog at D < 71Mpc has a much
lower significance when one considers only the ~20 UHECRs not `matched' to
nearby extended radiogalaxies. No correlation is seen between UHECRs and
supernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters
of galaxies. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre
Auger Observatory and previous experiments may thus be that the Southern
Hemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby extended radiogalaxies.

transverse homogeneous magnetic field drives carrier states from a quasi-2D

the cylinder surface. Furthermore, a magnetic field which is periodically
modulated along the cylinder axis may confine the carriers to tunnel-coupled
