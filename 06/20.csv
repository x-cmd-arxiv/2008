demonstrated why Bell inequalities must be violated in the manifestly local,

the gas content of low-mass galaxies, even those capable of efficient atomic
cooling, and thus lead to an extended reionization epoch. In this work, we
explore the importance of negative UV radiative feedback on Tvir > 10^4 K halos
during the middle and late stages of reionization. We do not try to
self-consistently model reionization; instead, we explore a large parameter
space in an attempt to draw general, robust conclusions. We do this using a
tiered approach. Using 1-D hydrodynamical simulations, we model the collapse of
gas onto halos of various masses under UVBs of various intensities. We then
generate realistic, parametrized maps of the inhomogeneous UVB, using
large-scale semi-numeric simulations. By combining these results, we find that
under all reasonably conservative scenarios, UV feedback on atomically-cooled
halos is not strong enough to notably delay the bulk of reionization. Such a
delay is only likely if ionizing efficiencies of z > 10 sources are much higher
(~ two orders of magnitude) than z ~ 6 data seem to imply. We also find that
feedback is very strongly dependent on halo mass. Our results suggest that the
natural time-scale for the bulk of reionization is the growth of the global
collapsed fraction contained in Tvir > 10^4 K halos. Finally, our results
underscore the importance of taking into account extended dynamical ranges when
modeling reionization.

investigated. The junctions' conductance at room temperature and
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at 4.2 K have been measured after the
consecutive stressing of the tunnel barrier at room temperature. Electrical
stress was applied using current ramps with increasing amplitude ranging from 0
to ~1000 Ic corresponding to voltages across the barrier up to 0.65 V where Ic
is the Josephson critical current. A very soft breakdown has been observed with
polarity-dependent breakdown current (voltage). A dramatic increase in subgap
conductance of the junctions, the appearance of subharmonic current steps, and
gradual increase in both the critical and the excess currents as well as a
decrease in the normal-state resistance have been observed. The observed
changes in superconducting tunneling suggest a model in which a progressively
increasing number of defects and associated additional conduction channels
(superconducting quantum point contacts (SQPCs)) are induced by electric field
in the tunnel barrier. By comparing the I-V characteristics of these conduction
channels with the nonstationary theory of current transport in SQPCs based on
multiple Andreev reflections by Averin and Bardas, the typical transparency D
of the induced SQPCs was estimated as D ~ 0.7. The number of induced SQPCs was
found to grow with voltage across the barrier as sinh(V/V_0) with V_0 = 0.045
V, in good agreement with the proposed model of defect formation by ion
electromigration. The observed polarity dependence of the breakdown current

consists of 578 HI detections within the range 11h 36m < R.A.(J2000) < 13h 52m
and +08 deg < Dec.(J2000) < +12 deg, and cz_sun < 18000 km/s. The catalog
entries are identified with optical counterparts where possible through the
examination of digitized optical images. The catalog detections can be
classified into three categories: (a) detections of high reliability with S/N >
6.5; (b) high velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery; and (c)
signals of lower S/N which coincide spatially with an optical object and known
redshift. 75% of the sources are newly published HI detections. Of particular
note is a complex of HI clouds projected between M87 and M49 that do not
coincide with any optical counterparts. Candidate objects without optical
counterparts are few. The median redshift for this sample is 6500 km/s and the
cz distribution exhibits the local large scale structure consisting of Virgo
and the background void and the A1367-Coma supercluster regime at cz_sun ~7000
km/s. Position corrections for telescope pointing errors are applied to the
dataset by comparing ALFALFA continuum centroid with those cataloged in the
NRAO VLA Sky Survey. The uncorrected positional accuracy averages
  27 arcsec ~(21 arcsec ~median) for all sources with S/N > 6.5 and is of order
~21 arcsec ~(16 arcsec ~median) for signals with S/N > 12. Uncertainties in
distances toward the Virgo cluster can affect the calculated HI mass
distribution.

Rather than passing messages consisting of symbol probabilities, this decoder
passes lists of possible symbols and marks some lists as verified. The density
evolution (DE) equations for this decoder are derived and used to compute
decoding thresholds. If the maximum list size is unbounded, then we find that
any capacity-achieving LDPC code for the binary erasure channel can be used to
achieve capacity on the q-SC for large q. The decoding thresholds are also
computed via DE for the case where each list is truncated to satisfy a maximum
list size constraint. Simulation results are also presented to confirm the DE
results. During the simulations, we observed differences between two
verification-based decoding algorithms, introduced by Luby and Mitzenmacher,
that were implicitly assumed to be identical. In this paper, we provide an
analysis of the node-based algorithms from that paper and verify that it
matches simulation results. The probability of false verification (FV) is also
considered and techniques are discussed to mitigate the FV. Optimization of the
degree distribution is also used to improve the threshold for a fixed maximum
list size. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with a variety of other
algorithms using both density evolution thresholds and simulation results.

and is therefore in practice often hard to realize. We thus propose the study
of an alternative set of invariants of algebraic concordance - the rational

to be transmitted when each block is of length t, and let \beta be the limit
\beta = \lim_{t \to \infty} \beta_t/t. In words, \beta is the average
communication cost per bit in each block (for long blocks). Finding the coding
rate \beta, for such an informed broadcast setting, generalizes several coding
theoretic parameters related to Informed Source Coding on Demand, Index Coding
and Network Coding.
  In this work we show that usage of large data blocks may strictly improve
upon the trivial encoding which treats each bit in the block independently. To
this end, we provide general bounds on \beta_t, and prove that for any constant
C there is an explicit broadcast setting in which \beta = 2 but \beta_1 > C.
One of these examples answers a question of Lubetzky and Stav.
  In addition, we provide examples with the following counterintuitive
direct-sum phenomena. Consider a union of several mutually independent
broadcast settings. The optimal code for the combined setting may yield a
significant saving in communication over concatenating optimal encodings for
the individual settings. This result also provides new non-linear coding
schemes which improve upon the largest known gap between linear and non-linear
Network Coding, thus improving the results of Dougherty, Freiling, and Zeger.

(ii) The distributions of the inner periods in triple and quadruple stars are

periods. (iii) The statistics of outer periods and mass ratios in triples and
quadruples are different. The median outer mass ratio in triples is 0.39
independently of the outer period, which has a smooth distribution. In
contrast, the outer periods of 25% quadruples concentrate in the narrow range

(v) The inner and outer orbital angular momenta and periods in triple and
quadruple systems with inner periods above 30d show some correlation, the ratio
of outer-to-inner periods is mostly comprised between 5 and 10^4. In the
systems with small period ratios the directions of the orbital spins are

will cause a redshift-dependent systematic shift in the Hubble diagram.
Utilizing an existing sample of 192 SNe Ia, we find that the average luminosity
difference between prompt and delayed SNe is constrained to be $(4.5 \pm

energy equation of state (EOS) determined from a sample of 2300 SNe Ia is
biased at $\sim1\sigma$. By incorporating the possibility of a two-population
systematic, this bias can be eliminated. However, assuming no prior on the
strength of the two-population effect, the uncertainty in the best-fit EOS is
increased by a factor of 2.5, when compared to the equivalent sample with no
underlying two-population systematic. To avoid introducing a bias in the EOS
parameters, or significantly degrading the measurement accuracy, it is
necessary to control the post-calibration luminosity difference between prompt

simulations indicate that AGN bubbles are disrupted into resolution-dependent
pockets of underdense gas, proper modeling of subgrid turbulence indicates that
this a poor approximation to a turbulent cascade that continues far beyond the
resolution limit. Instead, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities act to effectively mix
the heated region with its surroundings, while at the same time preserving it
as a coherent structure, consistent with observations. Thus bubbles are
transformed into hot clouds of mixed material as they move outwards in the
hydrostatic intracluster medium (ICM), much as large airbursts lead to a
distinctive ``mushroom cloud'' structure as they rise in the hydrostatic

important implications for many ICM properties. In particular, it significantly

enhanced due to resonant scattering of Lyman alpha photons in a clumpy
interstellar medium (ISM). Our results show a large range of stellar population
age (3 - 500 Myr), stellar mass (1.6 x 10^8 - 5.0 x 10^10 Msol) and dust
extinction (A_1200 = 0.3 - 4.5 mag), broadly consistent with previous studies.
With such a large number of individually analyzed objects, we have looked at
the distribution of stellar population ages in LAEs for the first time, and we
find a very interesting bimodality, in that our objects are either very young
(< 15 Myr) or old (> 450 Myr). This bimodality may be caused by dust, and it
could explain the Lyman alpha duty cycle which has been proposed in the
literature. We find that eight of the young objects are best fit with a clumpy
ISM. We find that dust geometry appears to play a large role in shaping the
SEDs that we observe, and that it may be a major factor in the observed Lyman
alpha equivalent width distribution in high redshift Lyman alpha galaxies,
although other factors (i.e. outflows) may be in play. We conclude that 12 out

predictions that are strongly inconsistent with the measured host star radial
velocities, transiting planet primary and secondary eclipse times, and
transiting planet orbital inclinations. A search for an alternative two planet
model that is consistent with the data yields a number of plausible solutions,
although no single one stands out as particularly unique by giving a
significantly better fit to the data than the nominal single planet model. We
conclude from this study that Ribas and collaborator's general hypothesis of an
additional short-period planet in the GJ436 system is still plausible, but that
there is not sufficient evidence to support their claim of a planet detection.

velocity dispersion of the host of a luminous quasar. The quasar PG1426+015
(z=0.086) was observed with the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer
(NIFS) on the 8m Gemini North telescope in the H-band as part of the Science
Verification phase of the new ALTAIR LGS AO system. The NIFS IFU and LGS AO are
well suited for host studies of luminous quasars because one can achieve a
large ratio of host to quasar light. We have measured the stellar velocity
dispersion of PG1426+015 from 0.1'' to 1'' (0.16 kpc to 1.6 kpc) to be 217+/-15
km/s based on high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of Si I, Mg I, and
several CO bandheads. This new measurement is a factor of four more precise
than a previous measurement obtained with long-slit spectroscopy and good,
natural seeing, yet was obtained with a shorter net integration time. We find
that PG1426+015 has a velocity dispersion that places it significantly above
the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies and lower-luminosity active galactic
nuclei with black hole masses estimated from reverberation mapping. We discuss
several possible explanations for this discrepancy that could be addressed with
similar observations of a larger sample of luminous quasars.

provide a unique opportunity to study thermal and non-thermal properties of the

relics traces structure formation shock waves and illuminates the large-scale
magnetic field. To show this, we model the population of shock-accelerated
relativistic electrons in high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy
clusters and calculate the resulting radio synchrotron emission. We find that
individual shock waves correspond to localized peaks in the radio surface
brightness map which enables us to measure Mach numbers for these shocks. We
show that the luminosities and number counts of the relics strongly depend on
the magnetic field properties, the cluster mass and dynamical state. By
suitably combining different cluster data, including Faraday rotation measures,
we are able to constrain some macroscopic parameters of the plasma at the
structure formation shocks, such as models of turbulence. We also predict upper
limits for the properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium, such as its
temperature and density. We predict that the current generation of radio
telescopes (LOFAR, GMRT, MWA, LWA) have the potential to discover a
substantially larger sample of radio relics, with multiple relics expected for
each violently merging cluster. Future experiments (SKA) should enable us to
further probe the macroscopic parameters of plasma physics in clusters.

In water, in particular, this effect combines with generic orientational
preferences induced by spatial asymmetry of water hydrogen bonding under
confined geometry, which may give rise to a Janus interface. The two effects
manifest themselves in considerable dependence of water polarization on both
the field direction relative to the interface, and the polarity (sign) of the
field. Using molecular simulations, we demonstrate strong field-induced
orientational forces acting on apolar surfaces through water mediation. At a
field strength comparable to electric fields around a DNA polyion, the torques
we predict to act on an adjacent nanoparticle are sufficient to overcome
thermal fluctuations. These torques can align a particle with surface as small

suspended nanoparticles as a means of tuning their properties, and can find
application in electro-nanomechanical devices.

motion of a ""small body"" in general relativity, taking into account the leading
order self-force effects. However, previous derivations of these equations have
made a number of ad hoc assumptions and/or contain a number of unsatisfactory
features. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper
justification, the step of ""Lorenz gauge relaxation"", wherein the linearized
Einstein equation is written down in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge,
but the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed--thereby making the
resulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized
Einstein equations. In this paper, we analyze the issue of ""particle motion"" in
general relativity in a systematic and rigorous way by considering a
one-parameter family of metrics, $g_{ab} (\lambda)$, corresponding to having a
body (or black hole) that is ""scaled down"" to zero size and mass in an
appropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of such a
one-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric, $g_{ab}
(\lambda=0)$. Gravitational self-force--as well as the force due to coupling of
the spin of the body to curvature--then arises as a first-order perturbative
correction in $\lambda$ to this worldline. No assumptions are made in our
analysis apart from the smoothness and limit properties of the one-parameter
family of metrics. Our approach should provide a framework for systematically
calculating higher order corrections to gravitational self-force, including
higher multipole effects, although we do not attempt to go beyond first order
calculations here. The status of the MiSaTaQuWa equations is explained.

suitable parameter range. The temporal distribution of these Grand Minima
appears chaotic, with a more or less exponential waiting time distribution,
typical of Poisson processes. In contrast however, the available reconstruction
of Grand Minima statistics based on cosmogenic isotope data demonstrates
substantial deviations from this exponential law. We were unable to reproduce
the non-Poissonic tail of the waiting time distribution either in the framework
of a simple alpha-quenched Parker model, or in its straightforward

statement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the

part of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate
sampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces,
generated by m kernels with period T. We model sparsity by treating the case in
which only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which
k are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T,
which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach
combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed
block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite
counterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the
framework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms
developed in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in
contrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider
sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model
exists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature

emission. Assuming a $\delta$ function emission we get formulas that get rid of
the impacts from the intrinsic emission duration, which are applicable to any
forms of continuum. The formulas predict that the same form of spectrum could
be observed at different times, with the peak energy of the spectrum shifting
from higher energy bands to lower bands following $E_{peak}\propto t^{-1}$.
When the emission is early enough the light curve in the form $f_{\nu

temporal power law index and the spectral power law index will be related by
$\alpha =2+\beta $. The analysis shows that there do exist a temporal steep
decay phase and a spectral softening which occur simultaneously, and both are
caused by the shifting of the Band function spectrum. According to the
analysis, we predict that the softening due to the curvature effect will appear
at different frequencies; it occurs earlier for higher frequencies and later
for lower frequencies; the maximum spectral index time follows the
$t_{b,max}\propto \nu^{-1}$ law. We also find: the softening duration would be
linearly correlated with the maximum spectral index time; the observed
$\beta_{min}$ and $\beta_{max}$ are determined by the low and high energy
indexes of the observed Band function spectrum. We propose to check the
curvature effect with the $\log f_{\nu}(t)t^{3}$ vs. $log t$ curve which would
be in agreement with the $\log \nu f_{\nu}$ vs. $log \nu$ curve. Applying this
to GRB 060614 shows that the peak energy of its observed spectrum is expected
to pass through the observation band at $\sim $175 s.

preventive health science. The spine, or vertebral column, represents a chain
of 26 movable vertebral bodies, joint together by transversal viscoelastic
intervertebral discs and longitudinal elastic tendons. This paper proposes a
new locally-coupled loading-rate hypothesis}, which states that the main cause
of both soft- and hard-tissue spinal injury is a localized Euclidean jolt, or
SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that strikes a localized spine in several
coupled degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. To show this, based on the
previously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler
dynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding
coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is the main cause of two basic
forms of spinal injury: (i) hard-tissue injury of local translational
dislocations; and (ii) soft-tissue injury of local rotational disclinations.
Both the spinal dislocations and disclinations, as caused by the SE(3)-jolt,
are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum model.

fact that a constant flux of a conserved quantity exactly determines the

applicable or not. We focus on cluster--cluster aggregation and discuss the
consequences of mass conservation for the steady state of aggregation models
with a monomer source in the diffusion-limited regime. We derive the CFR for
the flux-carrying correlation function for binary aggregation with a general
scale-invariant kernel and show that this exponent is unique. It is independent
of both the dimension and of the details of the spatial transport mechanism, a
property which is very atypical in the diffusion-limited regime. We then
discuss in detail the ``locality criterion'' which must be satisfied in order
for the CFR scaling to be realisable. Locality may be checked explicitly for
the mean-field Smoluchowski equation. We show that if it is satisfied at the
mean-field level, it remains true over some finite range as one perturbatively
decreases the dimension of the system below the critical dimension, $d_c=2$,
entering the fluctuation-dominated regime. We turn to numerical simulations to
verify locality for a range of systems in one dimension which are, presumably,
beyond the perturbative regime. Finally, we illustrate how the CFR scaling may
break down as a result of a violation of locality or as a result of finite size
effects and discuss the extent to which the results apply to higher order

form factors of hadrons in the framework of two quantum field theories (QFT),
(a) Dual-Large $N_c$ QCD (Dual-$QCD_\infty$) for the pion, proton, and
$\Delta(1236)$, and (b) the Kroll-Lee-Zumino (KLZ) fully renormalizable Abelian
QFT for the pion form factor. Both theories provide a QFT platform to improve
on naive (tree-level) Vector Meson Dominance (VMD). Dual-$QCD_\infty$ provides
a tree-level improvement by incorporating an infinite number of zero-width
resonances, which can be subsequently shifted from the real axis to account for
the time-like behaviour of the form factors. The renormalizable KLZ model
provides a QFT improvement of VMD in the framework of perturbation theory. Due
to the relative mildness of the $\rho\pi\pi$ coupling, and the size of loop
suppression factors, the perturbative expansion is well defined in spite of
this being a strong coupling theory. Both approaches lead to considerable
improvements of VMD predictions for electromagnetic form factors, in excellent
agreement with data.

also appear since the overall conformal mode of the induced metric for the

detailed dynamics of the F-string as well as the instability by mapping the
Nambu-Goto action of the F-string to the tachyon effective action of the

metastable vacua occur classically, i.e., at tree-level, and in which
supersymmetry-breaking is sourced by both D-terms and F-terms. All relevant
dynamics is perturbative, and hence calculations of vacuum energies and
lifetimes can be performed explicitly. Moreover, we find that our construction
can even give rise to multiple non-supersymmetric vacua which are degenerate.
The non-trivial vacuum structure of such models therefore suggests that they
can provide a rich arena for future studies of vacuum metastability in
supersymmetric field theories. Our results may also have important consequences
for Z' phenomenology and the string landscape.

The study of high redshift Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) is limited

field spectroscopy (SINFONI), by studying the rest frame K band and stellar
mass TFR, and by selecting targets without a bias to strongly star forming
galaxies. In this paper, we demonstrate our methods on our best case. This
galaxy, F257, at z=2.03, was selecte from a sample of candidate high redshift
large disk galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field South that were selected with
photometric and morphological criteria. Methods. We used SINFONI at the VLT to
obtain an integral field spectrum of the Halpha line and hence a velocity field
and rotation curve. We also use UBVIJHK+IRAC band photometry to determine a
stellar photometric mass. Results. We find that F257 is indistinguishable from
local late type galaxies in many respects: it has a regular velocity field,
increasing velocity disperion towards its center, its rotation curve flattens
at 1-2 disk scale lengths, it has the same specific angular momentum as local
disks, its properties are consistent with the local K band TFR. Although mainly
rotationally supported, its gas component is dynamically heated with respect to
local galaxies (V/sigma_z ~ 4) and it is offset from the local stellar mass TFR
at the 2sigma level. But, this offset depends on the SED modeling parameters.
In particular, for a 2-component star formation history (SFH), F257 is in
agreement with the local stellar mass TFR. F257 is then a nearly (~75%) maximum
disk. The dynamical properties of F257 are more like those of local galaxies
than those of any other galaxy at similar redshift observed to date. However,
the gas-to-stellar mass ratio is unusally large: 2.5.

quantitatively match N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) for small 't Hooft coupling
with weakly coupled type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5. We approach this
regime by taking the same decoupling limit on both sides of the correspondence.
On the gauge theory side only the states in the SU(2) sector survive, and in
the planar limit the Hamiltonian is given by the XXX_{1/2} Heisenberg spin
chain. On the string theory side we show that the decoupling limit corresponds
to a non-relativistic limit. In this limit some of the bosonic modes and all of
the fermionic modes of the string become infinitely heavy and decouple. We
first take the decoupling limit of the string sigma-model classically. This
enables us to identify a semi-classical regime with semi-classical string
states even though we are in a regime corresponding to small 't Hooft coupling.
We furthermore analyze the quantum corrections that enter in taking the limit.
  From this we infer that gauge theory and string theory match, both in terms
of the action and the spectrum, for the leading part and the first correction
away from the semi-classical regime. Finally we consider the implications for
the hitherto unexplained matching of the one-loop contribution to the energy of
certain gauge theory and string theory states, and we explain how our results
give a firm basis for the matching of the Hagedorn temperature in

than points in space, and there are closed loops which belong both to A and B.
Direct product structure and hence the reduction procedure with respect to the

extended by including the states of electric strings which can open on the

additional degrees of freedom which also contribute to the entanglement

begin to accrete matter. We examine a wide variety of TeV-scale gravity
scenarios, basing the resulting accretion models on first-principles, basic,
and well-tested physical laws. These scenarios fall into two classes, depending
on whether accretion could have any macroscopic effect on the Earth at times
shorter than the Sun's natural lifetime. We argue that cases with such effect
at shorter times than the solar lifetime are ruled out, since in these
scenarios black holes produced by cosmic rays impinging on much denser white
dwarfs and neutron stars would then catalyze their decay on timescales
incompatible with their known lifetimes. We also comment on relevant lifetimes
for astronomical objects that capture primordial black holes. In short, this
study finds no basis for concerns that TeV-scale black holes from the LHC could
pose a risk to Earth on time scales shorter than the Earth's natural lifetime.
Indeed, conservative arguments based on detailed calculations and the
best-available scientific knowledge, including solid astronomical data,
conclude, from multiple perspectives, that there is no risk of any significance
whatsoever from such black holes.

test masses of our solution, which is a gravitational wave, is discussed. In
our solution test masses have an apparent motion in the direction of
propagation of the wave, while in the transverse direction they appear at rest.
In this way it is possible to think that gravitational waves would be
longitudinal waves, but, from careful investigation of this solution, it is
shown that the tidal forces associated with gravitational waves act along the
directions orthogonal to the direction of propagation of waves. The computation
is first made in the long wavelengths approximation (wavelength much larger
than the linear distances between test masses), then the analysis is
generalized to all gravitational waves.

wavelengths studied (349-265 nm in the pump) the transient signals exhibit two
distinct and well-defined behaviours: (i) Short-term (on the order of a
picosecond) polarization dependent transients and (ii) longer (10 ps - 1 ns)
time-scale decays. This letter focuses on the short time transient. In contrast
to an earlier study by Diau et al.22 [J. Chem. Phys. 110 (1999) 9785.] we
unambiguously assign the fast initial decay signal to rotational dephasing of
the initial alignment created by the pump transition.

Clusters NGC 6397 and NGC 6752, and compare the cluster abundances with those

from the band head system at 3360 \AA, using spectra of resolution R=45000
obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the VLT. We apply the same method
previously used on field stars, to allow a direct comparison of the results.
Nitrogen is found to have the same abundance in two of the NGC 6397 stars, in
spite of a difference of one order of magnitude in oxygen abundance between
them. In a third star of NGC 6397 the value is slightly lower, but compatible
with the other two, within the uncertainties. All the stars in NGC 6397 are
N-rich with respect to field objects of similar metallicity. The two stars in
NGC 6752 show a difference in nitrogen abundance by over one order of
magnitude. The same stars differ in the abundances of other elements such as
Na, O and Li, only by a factor 3-4. The behaviour of N is different in the two
clusters: no variation is observed NGC 6397, while a large variation is
observed in NGC 6752. This is consistent with a picture in which the stars in
NGC 6752 have been formed by a mixture of ``pristine'' material and material
which has been processed by an early generation of stars, referred to as
``polluters''. The N abundances here reported will help to constrain the
properties of the polluters. In the case of NGC 6397 a simple pollution history
is probably not viable, since the observed variations in O abundances are not
accompanied by corresponding variations in N or Li.

2003 by the LHC Safety Study Group, who concluded that they presented no
danger. Here we review their 2003 analysis in light of additional experimental
results and theoretical understanding, which enable us to confirm, update and
extend the conclusions of the LHC Safety Study Group. The LHC reproduces in the
laboratory, under controlled conditions, collisions at centre-of-mass energies
less than those reached in the atmosphere by some of the cosmic rays that have
been bombarding the Earth for billions of years. We recall the rates for the
collisions of cosmic rays with the Earth, Sun, neutron stars, white dwarfs and
other astronomical bodies at energies higher than the LHC. The stability of
astronomical bodies indicates that such collisions cannot be dangerous.
Specifically, we study the possible production at the LHC of hypothetical
objects such as vacuum bubbles, magnetic monopoles, microscopic black holes and
strangelets, and find no associated risks. Any microscopic black holes produced
at the LHC are expected to decay by Hawking radiation before they reach the
detector walls. If some microscopic black holes were stable, those produced by
cosmic rays would be stopped inside the Earth or other astronomical bodies. The
stability of astronomical bodies constrains strongly the possible rate of
accretion by any such microscopic black holes, so that they present no
conceivable danger. In the case of strangelets, the good agreement of
measurements of particle production at RHIC with simple thermodynamic models
constrains severely the production of strangelets in heavy-ion collisions at
the LHC, which also present no danger.

the light of their connection with chameleon theories. Formulated as
scalar-tensor theories, the f(R) theories imply the existence of a strong
coupling of the scalar field to matter. This would violate all experimental
gravitational tests on deviations from Newton's law. Fortunately, the existence
of a matter dependent mass and a thin shell effect allows one to alleviate
these constraints. The thin shell condition also implies strong restrictions on
the cosmological dynamics of the f(R) theories. As a consequence, we find that
the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to be extremely close to -1
in the recent past. We also examine the potential effects of f(R) theories in
the context of the Eot-wash experiments. We show that the requirement of a thin
shell for the test bodies is not enough to guarantee a null result on
deviations from Newton's law. As long as dark energy accounts for a sizeable
fraction of the total energy density of the Universe, the constraints which we
deduce also forbid any measurable deviation of the dark energy equation of
state from -1. All in all, we find that both cosmological and laboratory tests
imply that f(R) models are almost coincident with a Lambda-CDM model at the
background level.

interfacial scattering strength. For nonzero spin polarization, the conductance
curves vary nonmonotonically with FWM. The FWM dependence of the
self-consistent results is stronger than that previously found in
non-self-consistent calculations, since, in the self-consistent case, the
effective scattering potential near the interface depends on the FWM. The
dependence on interfacial scattering is monotonic. These results confirm that
it is impossible to characterize both the the FWM and the interfacial

the causes and effects. This article examines the changes in our climate,
comparing the recent changes with those in the past. There have been changes in
temperature, resulting in an average global rise over the last 300 years, as
well as widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea
level. There are many theories for the causes of the recent change in the
climate, including some natural and some human influenced. The most widely
believed cause of the climate change is increasing levels of Greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere and as the atmosphere plays an important role in making our
planet inhabitable, it is important to understand it in order to protect it.
However, there are other theories for the cause of climate change, the Sun and
cosmic rays, for example, are felt by some to have a significant role to play.
There is also well-established evidence that the three Milankovitch cycles
change the amount and alter the distribution of sunlight over the Earth,
heating and cooling it. There are many influences on our planet and they all
have differing levels of impact. The purpose of this article is to review the
present overall position and urge open, reasoned discussion of the problem.
