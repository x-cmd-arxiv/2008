width under the influence of an external magnetic field exhibits three distinct
dynamical regimes. In a viscous regime at low fields the wall moves rigidly
with a velocity proportional to the field. Above a critical field the viscous
motion breaks down giving way to oscillations accompanied by a slow drift of
the wall. At still higher fields the drift velocity starts rising with the
field again but with a much lower mobility dv/dH than in the viscous regime. To
describe the dynamics of the wall we use the method of collective coordinates
that focuses on soft modes of the system. By retaining two soft modes,
parametrized by the coordinates of the vortex core, we obtain a simple
description of the wall dynamics at low and intermediate applied fields that
describes both the viscous and oscillatory regimes below and above the
breakdown. The calculated dynamics agrees well with micromagnetic simulations
at low and intermediate values of the driving field. In higher fields,
additional modes become soft and the two-mode approximation is no longer
sufficient. We explain some of the significant features of vortex domain wall
motion in high fields through the inclusion of additional modes associated with
the half-antivortices on the strip edge.

depend very sensitively on small changes in interatomic distances and bond
angles within the iron-pnictogen subunit. Using first-principles full-potential
electronic structure calculations, we investigate this sensitive dependence,
contrasting in particular LaOFeAs and LaOFeP. The width of the Fe-bands is
significantly larger for LaOFeP, indicating a better metal and weaker
electronic correlations. When calculated at their experimental crystal
structure these two materials have significantly different low-energy band
structure. The topology of the Fermi surface changes when going from LaOFeP to
LaOFeAs, with a three-dimensional hole pocket present in the former case
transforming into a tube with two-dimensional dispersion. We show that the
low-energy band structure of LaOFeAs evolves towards that of LaOFeP as the As
atom is lowered closer to the Fe plane with respect to its experimental
position. The physical origin of this sensitivity to the iron-pnictogen
distance is the covalency of the iron-pnictogen bond, leading to strong
hybridization effects. To illustrate this, we construct Wannier functions,
which are found to have a large spatial extension when the energy window is
restricted to the bands with dominant iron character. Finally, we show that the
Fe bandwidth slightly increases as one moves along the rare-earth series in
ReOFeAs and discuss the physical origin of this effect.

for the cases where the noise has a non trivial time-correlation structure and
when inertial effects cannot be neglected. Modified equations are used to

$d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$. Each of these Hamiltonians is an extended t-t'-J-J'

For the case of the undoped material the second subspace alone prefers a ground
state characterized by a spin-density-wave order similar to that observed in
recent experimental studies, while the other two subspaces prefer an
antiferromagnetic order. We argue that the observed spin-density-wave order
minimizes the ground state energy of the total hamiltonian.

density profile, which appears to be robust to changes in the overall density
of the universe and the underlying power spectrum. Despite its universality,
the physical origin of this profile has not yet been well understood.
Semi--analytic models by Barnes et al. (2005) have suggested that the density
structure of dark matter halos is determined by the onset of the radial orbit
instability (ROI). We have tested this hypothesis using N-body simulations of
collapsing dark matter halos with a variety of initial conditions. For
dynamically cold initial conditions, the resulting halo structures are triaxial
in shape, due to the mild aspect of the instability. We examine how variations
in initial velocity dispersion affect the onset of the instability, and find
that an isotropic velocity dispersion can suppress the ROI entirely, while a
purely radial dispersion does not. The quantity sigma^2/vc^2 is a criterion for
instability, where regions with sigma^2/vc^2 <~1 become triaxial due to the ROI
or other perturbations. We also find that the radial orbit instability sets a
scale length at which the velocity dispersion changes rapidly from isotropic to
radially anisotropic. This scale length is proportional to the radius at which
the density profile changes shape, as is the case in the semi--analytic models;
however, the coefficient of proportionality is different by a factor of ~2.5.
We conclude that the radial orbit instability is likely to be a key physical
mechanism responsible for the nearly universal profiles of simulated dark
matter halos.

transferred from the underlying disk into the disk corona by MHD turbulence
(anomalous turbulent diffusivity), or as a result of ambipolar diffusion in
partially ionized flows. We conclude that while the classical magnetic Reynolds
number $R_{\rm m}$ measures the importance of resistive effects in the
induction equation, a new introduced number, $\rbeta=(\beta/2)R_{\rm m}$ with
$\beta$ the plasma beta, measures the importance of the resistive effects in
the energy equation. Thus, in magnetised jets with $\beta<2$, when $\rbeta \la
1$ resistive effects are non-negligible and affect mostly the energy equation.
The presented simulations indeed show that for a range of magnetic
diffusivities corresponding to $\rbeta \ga 1$ the flow remains close to the

determining a local minimum of f--a vertex v for which f(v) is no more than f
evaluated at any of v's neighbors. In 1983, Aldous gave the first strong lower
bounds for the problem, showing that any randomized algorithm requires
$\Omega(2^{n/2 - o(1)})$ queries to determine a local minima on the
n-dimensional hypercube. The next major step forward was not until 2004 when
Aaronson, introducing a new method for query complexity bounds, both
strengthened this lower bound to $\Omega(2^{n/2}/n^2)$ and gave an analogous
lower bound on the quantum query complexity. While these bounds are very
strong, they are known only for narrow families of graphs (hypercubes and
grids). We show how to generalize Aaronson's techniques in order to give
randomized (and quantum) lower bounds on the query complexity of local search
for the family of vertex-transitive graphs. In particular, we show that for any
vertex-transitive graph G of N vertices and diameter d, the randomized and
quantum query complexities for local search on G are $\Omega(N^{1/2}/d\log N)$

tracers are morphologically similar, but important differences exist.
Dust-based measures give similar, log-normal, distributions for the full
Perseus region, once careful calibration corrections are made. We also compare
dust- and gas-based column density distributions for physically-meaningful
sub-regions of Perseus, and we find significant variations in the distributions
for those regions. Even though we have used 12CO data to estimate excitation
temperatures, and we have corrected for opacity, the 13CO maps seem unable to
give column distributions that consistently resemble those from dust measures.
We have edited out the effects of the shell around the B-star HD 278942. In
that shell's interior and in the parts where it overlaps the molecular cloud,
there appears to be a dearth of 13CO, likely due either to 13CO not yet having
had time to form in this young structure, and/or destruction of 13CO in the
molecular cloud. We conclude that the use of either dust or gas measures of
column density without extreme attention to calibration and artifacts is more
perilous than even experts might normally admit. And, the use of 13CO to trace
total column density in detail, even after proper calibration, is unavoidably
limited in utility due to threshold, depletion, and opacity effects. If one's
main aim is to map column density, then dust extinction seems the best probe.
Linear fits amongst column density tracers are given, quantifying the inherent
uncertainties in using one tracer (when compared with others). [abridged]

and objects in different age brackets, namely open clusters, HII regions,
cepheid variables and stars in OB associations. We find evidences for a space
variation of the radial gradients as measured for element ratios such as O/H,
S/H, Ne/H, Ar/H and [Fe/H], in the sense that the gradients tend to flatten out
at large galactocentric distances. Moreover, near the bulge-disk interface a
steep decrease in the abundances is observed. The time evolution of the
gradients is also evaluated on the basis of approximate ages attributed to the
central stars of planetary nebulae and open cluster stars. It is concluded that
the available data is consistent with a time flattening of the gradients during
the last 6 to 8 Gyr, a time interval in which the age determinations are

Schottky barrier at the Fe/Si contact as tunneling barrier. Our calculations
are based on density-functional theory for the description of the electronic
structure and on a Landauer-Buttiker approach for the current. The
current-carrying states correspond to the six conduction band minima of Si,
which, when projected on the (001) surface Brillouin zone (SBZ), form five
conductance hot spots: one at the SBZ center and four symmetric satellites. The
satellites yield a current polarization of about 50%, while the SBZ center can,
under very low gate voltage, yield up to almost 100%, showing a zero-gate
anomaly. This extremely high polarization is traced back to the symmetry
mismatch of the minority-spin Fe wavefunctions to the conduction band
wavefunctions of Si at the SBZ center. The tunneling current is determined by
the complex band structure of Si in the [001] direction, which shows
qualitative differences compared to that of direct-gap semiconductors.
Depending on the Fermi level position and Schottky barrier thickness, the
complex band structure can cause the contribution of the satellites to be
orders of magnitude higher or lower than the central contribution. Thus, by
appropriate tuning of the interface properties, there is a possibility to cut
off the satellite contribution and to reach high injection efficiency. Also, we
find that a moderate strain of 0.5% along the [001] direction is sufficient to
lift the degeneracy of the pockets so that only states at the zone center can
carry current.

disintegrate into many fragments during a short time (~100 fm/c). This
phenomenon known as nuclear multifragmentation was under intensive
investigation last 20 years. It was established that multifragmentation is an
universal process taking place in all reactions when the excitation energy
transferred to nuclei is high enough, more than 3 MeV per nucleon,
independently on the initial dynamical stage of the reactions. Very known
compound nucleus decay processes (sequential evaporation and fission), which
are usual for low energies, disappear and multifragmentation dominates at high
excitation energy. For this reason, calculation of multifragmentation must be
carried on in all cases when production of highly excited nuclei is expected,
including spallation reactions. From the other hand, one can consider
multifragmentation as manifestation of the liquid-gas phase transition in
finite nuclei. This gives way for studying nuclear matter at subnuclear
densities and for applications of properties of nuclear matter extracted from
multifragmentation reactions in astrophysics. In this contribution, the
Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM), which combines the compound nucleus
processes at low energies and multifragmentation at high energies, is
described. The most important ingredients of the model are discussed.

Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models to compute the galactic stellar masses and
extinctions. We determine the expected formed stellar mass density growth rates
produced by star formation and compare them with the growth rates measured from
the formed stellar mass functions by mass interval. We show that the growth
rates match if the IMF is slightly increased from the Salpeter IMF at
intermediate masses (~10 solar masses). We investigate the evolution of galaxy
color, spectral type, and morphology with mass and redshift and the evolution
of mass with environment. We find that applying extinction corrections is
critical when analyzing galaxy colors; e.g., nearly all of the galaxies in the
green valley are 24um sources, but after correcting for extinction, the bulk of
the 24um sources lie in the blue cloud. We find an evolution of the
metallicity-mass relation corresponding to a decrease of 0.21+/-0.03 dex

VDF at each redshift, and compare the accumulated total BH mass density with
that inferred from the integrated quasar luminosity function (LF; the
so--called Soltan argument). This comparison is insensitive to the assumed duty
cycle or Eddington ratio of quasar activity, and we find that the match between
the two BH mass densities favors a relatively mild redshift evolution, with
alpha ~ 0.26, with a positive evolution as strong as alpha>1.3 excluded at the
99% confidence level. A direct match between the characteristic BH mass in the
VDF--based and quasar LF--based BH mass functions also yields a mean Eddington
ratio of lambda ~ 0.5-1 that is roughly constant within 0<z<3. A strong
positive evolution in the M_BH-sigma relation is still allowed by the data if
galaxies increase, on average, their velocity dispersions since the moment of
formation, due to dissipative processes. If we assume that the mean velocity
dispersion of the host galaxies evolves as sigma(z)=sigma(0)*(1+z)^{-gamma}, we
find a lower limit of gamma>0.23 for alpha>1.5. abridged

differences in the simulation with metal cooling when compared to the run
without it: (1) the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced by about 50 &
20% at z=1 & 3, respectively; (2) the gas mass fraction in galaxies is lower;
(3) the total baryonic mass function (gas + star) at z=3 does not differ

galaxies at z=1; (4) the baryonic mass fraction of intergalactic medium (IGM)
is reduced at z<3 due to more efficient cooling and gas accretion onto
galaxies. Our results suggest that the metal cooling enhances the galaxy growth
by two different mechanisms: (1) increase of SF efficiency in the local
interstellar medium (ISM), and (2) increase of IGM accretion onto galaxies. The
former process is effective throughout most of the cosmic history, while the
latter is effective only at z<3 when the IGM is sufficiently enriched by metals

determines the amount of pressure in inhomogeneous and collapsed structures.
Since the evolution of these structures must be followed well into the
nonlinear regime, and a fully relativistic framework for this regime does not
exist yet, we compare two approximate schemes: the widely used spherical
collapse model, and the pseudo-Newtonian approach. We show that both
approximation schemes convey identical equations for the density contrast, when
the pressure perturbation of dark energy is parametrized in terms of an

spatially distributed signals, the information fields. A didactical approach is
attempted. Starting from general considerations on the nature of measurements,
signals, noise, and their relation to a physical reality, we derive the
information Hamiltonian, the source field, propagator, and interaction terms.
Free IFT reproduces the well known Wiener-filter theory. Interacting IFT can be
diagrammatically expanded, for which we provide the Feynman rules in position-,
Fourier-, and spherical harmonics space, and the Boltzmann-Shannon information
measure. The theory should be applicable in many fields. However, here, two
cosmological signal recovery problems are discussed in their IFT-formulation.
1) Reconstruction of the cosmic large-scale structure matter distribution from
discrete galaxy counts in incomplete galaxy surveys within a simple model of
galaxy formation. We show that a Gaussian signal, which should resemble the
initial density perturbations of the Universe, observed with a strongly
non-linear, incomplete and Poissonian-noise affected response, as the processes
of structure and galaxy formation and observations provide, can be
reconstructed thanks to the virtue of a response-renormalization flow equation.
2) We design a filter to detect local non-linearities in the cosmic microwave
background, which are predicted from some Early-Universe inflationary
scenarios, and expected due to measurement imperfections. This filter is the
optimal Bayes' estimator up to linear order in the non-linearity parameter and
can be used even to construct sky maps of non-linearities in the data.

suppression has been recently obtained by Vainshtein et al [PRE 56, (1997)] in
nonlinear ABC and stretch-twist-fold (STF) dynamos by using a magnetic Reynolds
number of the order of $Rm\approx{10^{4}}$. Here when torsion does not vanish
an expression between magnetic Reynolds number and length scale L as with
constant torsion ${\tau}_{0}$ itself is obtained, such as
$Rm\approx{\frac{{\tau}_{0}L}{\eta}}$ is obtained. At coronal loops
$Rm\approx{10^{12}}$ and torsion of the twisted structured loop from
astronomical data by Lopez-Fuentes et al [Astron. and Astrophys. (2003)] of
${\tau}\approx{9.0{\times}10^{-10}}cm^{-1}$ is used to compute a very slow
magnetic diffusion of ${\eta}\approx{10^{-8}}$. The slow dynamo obtained here
is in agreement with Vishik arguement that fast dynamo cannot be obtained in
non-stretched dynamo flows. When torsion vanishes helical turbulence is
quenched and but ${\alpha}$-dynamos cannot be maintained since exponential
stretching depends on torsion. This is actually Zeldovich antidynamo theorem
for torsion-free or planar filaments which has been discussed by the other also

the diffraction-interference cross correlation reconstruction method (DICC) is
developed in order to overcome the imaging performance degradation. Based on

with the stable norm. The stable norm on $H_1(M,\mathbb{R})$ arises from the
Riemannian length functional by homogenization. It is difficult and interesting
to decide which norms on the finite-dimensional vector space
$H_1(M,\mathbb{R})$ are stable norms of a Riemannian metric on $M$. If the
dimension of $M$ is at least three, I. Babenko and F. Balacheff proved in
\cite{baba} that every polyhedral norm ball in $H_1(M,\mathbb{R})$, whose
vertices are rational with respect to the lattice of integer classes in
$H_1(M,\mathbb{R})$, is the stable norm ball of a Riemannian metric on $M$.
This metric can even be chosen to be conformally equivalent to any given
metric. The proof in \cite{baba} uses singular Riemannian metrics on polyhedra
which are finally smoothed. Here we present an alternative construction of such
metrics which remains in the geometric framework of smooth Riemannian metrics.

proved. And a noise-aiding way is developed to stabilize perturbed systems to
be input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to (w.r.t.) perturbations. To
illustrate its effectiveness, the white-noise-aided control of a parameter
perturbed chaotic Chen system is given as an example. And numerically, it shows
that, comparing to the un-noise-aided case, noise-aided control can not only
shorten the control's transient process but also save its cost. These are also
demonstrated by various aiding noises such as common (symmetric) noise and
non-common (independent or asymmetric) noise, where common noise is found to be
the most efficient in enhancing the control.

The need to develop methods that can accurately calculate isotope shifts in

to measure possible variation of the fine-structure constant alpha over the
lifetime of the Universe. Isotope shift can also be used to measure isotope
abundances in gas clouds in the early Universe, which are needed in order to
test models of chemical evolution.

provides an avenue for advanced algorithms that require origins in a consistent

their linearization, but maintain all other equivalences. Using the variational
multiscale concept, we construct a stabilized formulation (that may be
considered an extension of the MINI element to nonlinear Navier-Stokes). We
then linearize the problem using fixed-point iteration and by deriving a
consistent tangent matrix for the update equation to obtain the solution via
Newton-Raphson iterations. We show that the consistent formulation converges in
fewer iterations, as expected, for several test problems. We also show that the
consistent formulation converges for problems for which fixed-point iteration
diverges. We present the results of both methods for problems of Reynold's
