following the decline from the 2001-2002 outburst that led to its discovery.
Here we report on the first detection of its quiescent counterpart in a 36 ks
observation taken in 2007 July with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The inferred
0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux is in the range 2.5-5.0x1e-15 erg/s/cm^2.
Notwithstanding large distance uncertainties, the measured luminosity is
comparable to that of the faintest detected black hole X-ray binaries, all
having orbital periods close to the expected bifurcation period between j- and
n-driven low-mass X-ray binaries. This suggests that a few 1e30 erg/s might be
a limiting luminosity value for quiescent black holes.

applying an ac voltage with controllable frequency and amplitude across the
junction. The voltage induces transitions when the ac frequency equals n times
the splitting between the ground and first excited quasi-bound state of the
junction. We calculate the transition matrix elements as functions of the dc
bias current I, and the frequency and amplitude of the ac voltage, for
representative junction parameters. We also calculate the frequency-dependent
absorption coefficient by solving the relevant Bloch equations when the ac
amplitude is sufficiently small. In this regime, the absorption coefficient is
a sum of Lorentzian lines centered at the n-photon absorption frequency, of
strength proportional to the squared matrix elements. For fixed ac voltage
amplitude, the n-photon transition rate usually decreases with increasing n. We
also find a characteristic even-odd effect: The absorption coefficient
typically increases with I for n even but decreases for n odd. Our results
agree qualitatively with recent experiments.

the physics of all unconventional superconductors, e.g. in
high-transition-temperature cuprates 1, heavy fermions 2 and organic
superconductors3. Here superconductivity is often found close to a quantum
critical point where long-range antiferromagnetic order is gradually suppressed
as a function of a control parameter, e.g. charge carrier doping or pressure.
It is believed that dynamic spin fluctuations associated with this quantum
critical behaviour are crucial for the mechanism of superconductivity. Recently
high-temperature superconductivity has been discovered in iron-pnictides
providing a new class of unconventional superconductors4,5,6. Similar to other
unconventional superconductors the parent compounds of the pnictides exhibit a
magnetic ground state7,8 and superconductivity is induced upon charge carrier
doping. In this Letter the structural and electronic phase diagram is
investigated by means of x-ray scattering, MuSR and Moessbauer spectroscopy on
the series LaO1-xFxFeAs. We find a discontinuous first-order-like change of the
Neel temperature, the superconducting transition temperature and of the
respective order parameters. Our results strongly question the relevance of
quantum critical behaviour in ironpnictides and prove a strong coupling of the
structural orthorhombic distortion and the magnetic order both disappearing at
the phase boundary to the superconducting state.

decay (plateau) observed prevalently in Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) early afterglows.
In this model the plateau is the scattered prompt X-ray emission by the dust
located close (about 10 to a few hundred pc) to the GRB site. In this paper we
carefully investigate the model and find that the scattered emission undergoes
strong spectral softening with time, due to the model's essential ingredient
that harder X-ray photons have smaller scattering angle thus arrive earlier,
while softer photons suffer larger angle scattering and arrive later. The model
predicts a significant change, i.e., $\Delta \b \sim 2 - 3$, in the X-ray
spectral index from the beginning of the plateau toward the end of the plateau,
while the observed data shows close to zero softening during the plateau and
the plateau-to-normal transition phase. The scattering model predicts a big
difference between the harder X-ray light curve and the softer X-ray light
curve, i.e., the plateau in harder X-rays ends much earlier than in softer
X-rays. This feature is not seen in the data. The large scattering optical
depths of the dust required by the model imply strong extinction in optical,
$A_V \gtrsim $ 10, which contradicts current findings of $A_V= 0.1 - 0.7$ from
optical and X-ray afterglow observations. We conclude that the dust scattering
model can not explain the X-ray plateaus.

zero collision with no control message exchange nor synchronization. ZC
(ZeroCollision) is neither reservation-based nor dynamic TDMA; the protocol
supports variable-length packets and does not lose efficiency when some of the
stations do not transmit. At the same time, ZC is not a CSMA; in its steady
state, it is completely collision-free. The stations transmit repeatedly in a
round-robin order once the convergence state is reached. If some stations skip
their turn, their transmissions are replaced by idle $20 \mu$-second mini-slots
that enable the other stations to keep track of their order. Because of its
short medium access delay and its efficiency, the protocol supports both
real-time and elastic applications. The protocol allows for nodes leaving and
joining the network; it can allocate more throughput to specific nodes (such as
an access point). The protocol is robust against carrier sensing errors or
clock drift. While collision avoidance is guaranteed in a single collision
domain, it is not the case in a multiple collision one. However, experiments
show ZC supports a comparable amount of goodput to CSMA in a multiple collision
domain environment. The paper presents an analysis and extensive simulations of
the protocol, confirming that ZC outperforms both CSMA and TDMA at high and low
load.

include all the quantum-mechanical levels of the junction, but treat the
junction-cavity interaction using a mean-field approximation developed

including only the two lowest energy levels per junction, but with two

XY-like coupling between the junctions. The modified Dicke model can be treated
using a mean-field theory, which in the limit of zero XY coupling gives the
solution of the Dicke model in the thermodynamic limit using Glauber coherent
states to represent the cavity. In all cases, for an $N$-independent
junction-cavity coupling, there is a critical junction number $N$ above which
there is a continuous transition from incoherence to coherence with decreasing
$T$. If the coupling scales with $N$ so as to give a well-behaved thermodynamic

compared with similar data for stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
Absorption from acetylene in carbon stars is found to be equally strong in the
SMC as in the LMC, but the LMC stars show stronger dust emission in their
infrared colours and veiling of the molecular bands. This suggests that a
critical link exists in the formation of dust from the molecular atmosphere in
carbon stars which scales with the initial metallicity. Nucleation seeds based
on a secondary element such as titanium or silicon provide a plausible
explanation. In oxygen-rich stars, both the nucleation seeds and molecular
condensates depend on secondary elements (in particular titanium, silicon,
and/or aluminium). Data for pulsating dusty AGB stars and supergiants in the
LMC are used to show that pulsation is likely the critical factor in driving
mass loss, as long as dust forms, rather than the stellar luminosity. Finally,
we suggest that the reduced dust production and consequently slower winds of
metal-poor AGB stars and red supergiants are more likely to result in chemical
inhomogeneities and small-scale structure in the interstellar medium.

colour group to hidden space-time isometries originating from extra dimensions.
These isometries ($\alpha$-symmetries) are the special symmetries of RNS
superstring theories under global non-linear space-time transformations. The
vertex operators for the octet of gluons are constructed by the procedure of
``photon painting'', that is, with the SU(3) subgroup of the $\alpha$-symmetry
generators acting on a regular open string photon, so the corresponding open
string excitations are in the adjoint of SU(3). Remarkably, the operator
algebra of these massless gluon vertices is closed and possesses the full
zigzag symmetry, crucial for the isomorphism between open strings and QCD. As a
result, the scattering amplitudes of the constructed open string vertex
operators have a field-theoretic rather than a stringy structure, including the
absense of standard tower of massive intermediate states.Our model also
suggests that the total number of underlying hidden dimensions is three, with
each extra dimension carrying its appropriate SU(3) colour and anticolour.

reflections across its faces. We construct an explicit diffeomorphism between
the moduli space of a mirror projective polyhedron with fixed dihedral angles
in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$, and the union of $n$ copies of $\R^d$, when the
polyhedron has the combinatorics of an \emph{ecimahedron}, an infinite class of
combinatorial polyhedra we introduce here. Moreover, the integers $n$ and $d$
can be computed explicitly in terms of the combinatorics and the fixed dihedral
angles.

  elasticity theory",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using numerical and analytical calculations we study the structure of
vacancies and interstitials in two-dimensional colloidal crystals. In
particular, we compare the displacement fields of the defect obtained
numerically with the predictions of continuum elasticity theory for a simple
defect model. In such a comparison it is of crucial importance to employ
corresponding boundary conditions both in the particle and in the continuum
calculations. Here, we formulate the continuum problem in a way that makes it
analogous to the electrostatics problem of finding the potential of a point
charge in periodic boundary conditions. The continuum calculations can then be
carried out using the technique of Ewald summation. For interstitials, the
displacement fields predicted by elasticity theory are accurate at large
distances, but large deviations occur near the defect for distances of up to 10
lattice spacings. For vacancies, the elasticity theory predictions obtained for
the simple model do not reproduce the numerical results even far away from the
defect.

with potassium fluoride as a source as a source of fluorine instead of LaF3.
This route also allows the substitution of potassium at lanthanum sites which
leads to an increase in the upper critical field as would be expected for a
multiband superconductor. We also report the highest reported Tc onset of 28.5K
and highest upper critical field in these superconductors.

in the manifold can be blocked by a finite number of point obstacles. Compact,
flat manifolds are secure. A standing conjecture says that these are the only
secure, compact riemannian manifolds. The conjecture claims, in particular,
that a riemannian torus of any dimension is secure if and only if it is flat.
We prove this for two-dimensional tori.
