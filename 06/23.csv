the framework of the Quantum Dimer Model. A minimal model describing the
proliferation of itinerant spinons above a critical field is proposed and
investigated by Lanczos exact diagonalizations and quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. For both square and triangular lattices, it is shown that spinons
are fully polarized and Bose-condense. This offers a novel scenario of a
Quantum Critical Point in the dimer-liquid phase (triangular lattice)
characterized by the continuous appearance of a spinon superfluid density,
contrasting with the usual triplet condensation picture. The possible role of
other spinon kinetic terms neglected in the model are discussed.

a class of reducible representations of CCR. $A_a(x)$ transforms as a Hermitian
four-vector field in Minkowski four-position space (no change of gauge), but in
momentum space it splits into spin-1 massless photons (optics) and two massless
scalars (similar to dark matter). Unitary dynamics is given by point-form
interaction picture, with minimal-coupling Hamiltonian constructed from fields
that are free on the null-cone boundary of the Milne universe. SL(2,C)
transformations and dynamics are represented unitarily in positive-norm Hilbert
space describing $N$ four-dimensional oscillators. Vacuum is a Bose-Einstein
condensate of the $N$-oscillator gas. Both the form of $A_a(x)$ and its
transformation properties are determined by an analogue of the twistor
equation. The same equation guarantees that the subspace of vacuum states is,
as a whole, Poincar\'e invariant. The formalism is tested on quantum fields
produced by pointlike classical sources. Photon statistics is well defined even
for pointlike charges, with UV/IR regularizations occurring automatically as a
consequence of the formalism. The probabilities are not Poissonian but of a
R\'enyi type with $\alpha=1-1/N$. The average number of photons occurring in
Bremsstrahlung splits into two parts: The one due to acceleration, and the one
that remains nonzero even if motion is inertial. Classical Maxwell
electrodynamics is reconstructed from coherent-state averaged solutions of
Heisenberg equations. Static pointlike charges polarize vacuum and produce
effective charge densities and fields whose form is sensitive to both the
choice of representation of CCR and the corresponding vacuum state.

turbulent flow over a large range of particle diameter, using a Langevin PDF
model. The first aim of the work is to test how the present Langevin model is
able to describe this phenomenon and to outline the physical as- pects which
play a major role in particle deposition. The general features and
characteristics of the present stochastic model are first recalled. Then,
results obtained with the standard form of the model are presented along with
an analysis which has been carried out to check the sensitivity of the
predictions on different mean fluid quantities. These results show that the
physical repre- sentation of the near-wall physics has to be improved and that,
in particular, one possible route is to introduce specific features related to
the near-wall coherent structures. In the following, we propose a simple
phenomenological model that introduces some of the effects due to the presence
of turbulent coherent structures on particles in a thin layer close to the
wall. The results obtained with this phenomenological model are in good
agreement with experimental evidence and this suggests to pursue in that
direction, towards the development of more general and rigorous stochastic
models that provide a link between a geometrical description of turbulent flow
and a statistical one.

epidemic patterns in different regions that are due to human movement and
introduce a null model in which the travel-induced correlations are cancelled.
They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza
outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for
1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between
several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range
spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The
stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions
about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The
authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found
that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly
dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest
that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the
spread of epidemics.

X-ray afterglows of short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using a
large sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation
between the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observed
fluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux
densities (F_R and F_X) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, F_gamma. For bursts
with a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux
densities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy,
Egi: F_{R,X} ~ Egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. The constant of proportionality is
nearly identical for long and short bursts, when Egi is obtained from the Swift
data. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F_gamma >10^{-7} erg
cm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early
observations. Finally, we show that the ratio F_R/F_X has very similar values
for short and long bursts. These results are difficult to explain in the
framework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) the
number density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typically
comparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) short
bursts explode into a density profile, n(r)\alpha r^{-2} or (3) the prompt
gamma-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. We therefore
find it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of the
circumburst environment of short GRBs or else the standard models of GRB
emission must be re-examined. We believe that the most likely solution is that
the ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than has
generally been expected: a typical value of ~1 per cm^{-3} is indicated.

profile of the latter being characterized by four free parameters. The
parameter space of the halo is optimized so as to match the observed HI
thickness distribution as well as the rotation curve on an equal footing,
unlike the previous studies of M31 which were based on rotation curves alone.
We show that an oblate halo, with an isothermal density profile, provides the
best fit to the observed data. This gives a central density of 0.011 M_sun

lie at the most oblate end of the distribution of halo shapes found in recent

cosmologies, contrary to the scalar field approach (e.g., Chaplygin gas), the
new approach leads to anisotropic pressure, raising the issues of stability of
the isotropic solution under anisotropic perturbations and, being it stable,
how the anisotropies evolve. In this work, the Eddington-Born-Infeld proposal
is extended to a Bianchi type I scenario and residual post-inflationary
anisotropies are shown to decay in time. Moreover, it is shown that the shears
decay following a damped oscillatory pattern, instead of the standard
exponential-like decay. Allowing for some fine tuning on the initial

Through muscular contraction and
expansion of their foot, they transmit waves of shear stress through a thin
layer of mucus onto a solid substrate. Since a free surface cannot support
shear stress, adhesive locomotion is not a viable propulsion mechanism for
water snails that travel inverted beneath the free surface. Nevertheless, the
motion of the freshwater snail, Sorbeoconcha physidae, is reminiscent of that
of its terrestrial counterparts, being generated by the undulation of the snail
foot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus. Here, a
lubrication model is used to describe the mucus flow in the limit of small
amplitude interfacial deformations. By assuming the shape of the snail foot to
be a traveling sine wave and the mucus to be Newtonian, an evolution equation
for the interface shape is obtained and the resulting propulsive force on the
snail is calculated. This propulsive force is found to be non-zero for moderate
values of Capillary number but vanishes in the limits of high and low Capillary
numbers. Physically, this force arises because the snail's foot deforms the
free surface, thereby generating curvature pressures and lubrication flows
inside the mucus layer that couple to the topography of the foot.

In the present contribution we show how basin-hopping global optimization can

both lower minima and conformations closer to the experimental structure than
does molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. For large systems the
efficiency of basin-hopping decreases for our initial implementation, where the
steps consist of random perturbations to the Cartesian coordinates. We
implemented umbrella sampling using basin-hopping to further confirm when the
global minima are reached. We have also improved the energy surface by
employing bioinformatic techniques for reducing the roughness or variance of
the energy surface. Finally, the basin-hopping calculations have guided
improvements in the excluded volume of the Hamiltonian, producing better
structures. These results suggest a novel and transferable optimization scheme
for future energy function development.

water-filling on their channel transfer matrix singular values, frequently, not

insuring zero-interference on the pre-existing link. We propose a linear

hadronic interaction between cosmic ray and atmosphere around the Earth, known
as atmospheric neutrino. Current measurements on neutrino flux is consistent
with theoretical prediction of atmospheric neutrino within the uncertainties.
In this paper, by requiring that the DM annihilation neutrino flux is less than
the current measurements, we obtain an upper bound on the cross section of dark
matter annihilation $ < {\sigma v} >$. Compared with previous investigations,
we improve the bound by including DM substructure contributions. In our paper,
two kinds of substructure effects are scrutinized. One is the substructure
average contribution over all directions. The other is point source effect by
single massive sub-halo. We found that the former can improve the bound by
several times, while the latter can improve the bound by $ 10^1 \sim 10^4$
utilizing the excellent angular resolution of neutrino telescope IceCube. The
exact improvement depends on the DM profile and the sub-halo concentration

  Comm.Math.Phys. (47 pages)",,"10.1007/s00220-008-0716-x",,"math.OA math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce `braidability' as a new symmetry for (infinite) sequences of
noncommutative random variables related to representations of the braid group
$B_\infty$. It provides an extension of exchangeability which is tied to the
symmetric group $S_\infty$. Our key result is that braidability implies
spreadability and thus conditional independence, according to the
noncommutative extended de Finetti theorem (of C. K\""{o}stler). This endows the
braid groups $B_n$ with a new intrinsic (quantum) probabilistic interpretation.
We underline this interpretation by a braided extension of the Hewitt-Savage
Zero-One Law.
  Furthermore we use the concept of product representations of endomorphisms
(of R. Gohm) with respect to certain Galois type towers of fixed point algebras
to show that braidability produces triangular towers of commuting squares and
noncommutative Bernoulli shifts. As a specific case we study the left regular
representation of $B_\infty$ and the irreducible subfactor with infinite Jones
index in the non-hyperfinite $II_1$-factor $L(B_\infty)$ related to it. Our
investigations reveal a new presentation of the braid group $B_\infty$, the
`square root of free generator presentation' $F_\infty^{1/2}$. These new
generators give rise to braidability while the squares of them yield a free
family. Hence our results provide another facet of the strong connection
between subfactors and free probability theory and we speculate about
braidability as an extension of (amalgamated) freeness on the combinatorial
level.

because of zero-point oscillations of the helium ions that would dissolve the

instead form a macroscopic quantum state in which the charged helium-4 nuclei
are in a Bose-Einstein condensate, while the relativistic electrons form a
neutralizing degenerate Fermi liquid. We discuss the electric charge screening,
and the spectrum of this substance, showing that the bosonic long-wavelength
fluctuations exhibit a mass gap. Hence, there is a suppression at low
temperatures of the boson contribution to the specific heat -- the latter being
dominated by the specific heat of the electrons near the Fermi surface. This
state of matter may have observational signatures.

  II"", RevMexAA",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss a new technique of studying magnetic fields in diffuse
astrophysical media, e.g. interstellar and intergalactic gas/plasma. This
technique is based on the angular momentum alignment of atoms and ions in their
ground or metastable states. As the life-time of atoms in such states is long,
the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation is susceptible to weak magnetic
fields ($1{\rm G}\gtrsim B\gtrsim0.1\mu$G). The alignment reveals itself in
terms of the polarization of the absorbed and emitted light. A variety of atoms
with fine or hyperfine splitting of the ground or metastable states exhibit the
alignment and the resulting polarization degree in some cases exceeds 20%. We
show that in the case of absorption the polarization direction is either
parallel or perpendicular to magnetic field, while more complex dependencies
emerge for the case of emission of aligned atoms. We show that the
corresponding studies of magnetic fields can be performed with optical and UV
polarimetry. A unique feature of these studies is that they can reveal the 3D
orientation of magnetic field.
  In addition, we point out that the polarization of the radiation arising from
the transitions between fine and hyperfine states of the ground level can
provide yet another promising diagnostics of magnetic fields, including the
magnetic fields in the Early Universe. We mention several cases of
interplanetary, circumstellar and interstellar magnetic fields for which the
studies of magnetic fields using ground state atomic alignment effect are
promising.

and collaborators, we look within the ``fireshell'' model for a relation
between the peak energy E_p of the \nu F_\nu total time-integrated spectrum of
the afterglow and the total energy of the afterglow E_{aft}, which in our model
encompasses and extends the prompt emission. METODS: [...] Within the fireshell
model [...] We can then build two sets of ``gedanken'' GRBs varying the total
energy of the electron-positron plasma E^{e^\pm}_{tot} and keeping the same
baryon loading B of GRB050315. The first set assumes for the effective CBM
density the one obtained in the fit of GRB050315. The second set assumes
instead a constant CBM density equal to the average value of the GRB050315
prompt phase. RESULTS: For the first set of ``gedanken'' GRBs we find a
relation E_p\propto (E_{aft})^a, with a = 0.45 \pm 0.01, whose slope strictly
agrees with the Amati one. Such a relation, in the limit B \to 10^{-2},
coincides with the Amati one. Instead, in the second set of ``gedanken'' GRBs
no correlation is found. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis excludes the Proper-GRB
(P-GRB) from the prompt emission, extends all the way to the latest afterglow
phases and is independent on the assumed cosmological model, since all
``gedanken'' GRBs are at the same redshift. The Amati relation, on the other
hand, includes also the P-GRB, focuses on the prompt emission only, and is
therefore influenced by the instrumental threshold which fixes the end of the
prompt emission, and depends on the assumed cosmology. This may well explain
the intrinsic scatter observed in the Amati relation.
