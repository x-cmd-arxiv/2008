orientifold six-planes, where M6 is a six-dimensional compact space that is
either a nilmanifold or a coset. For all known solutions of this type we obtain
the four-dimensional N=1 low energy effective theory by computing the
superpotential, the Kaehler potential and the mass spectrum for the light
moduli. For the nilmanifold examples we perform a cross-check on the result for
the mass spectrum by calculating it alternatively from a direct Kaluza-Klein
reduction and find perfect agreement. We show that in all but one of the coset
models all moduli are stabilized at the classical level. As an application we
show that all but one of the coset models can potentially be used to bypass a
recent no-go theorem against inflation in type IIA theory.

spite of the large number of VCV galaxies in Virgo, since most of the VCV
galaxies in the Virgo region are low luminosity AGNs. Interestingly, the
bolometric luminosities of most of the AGNs are significantly lower than

level (k, -k). The scaling limit (and Inonu-Wigner contraction) is to scale the
trace part of the bifundamental fields as X_0 -> \lambda^{-1} X_0 and an axial

we scale the level as k -> \lambda^{-1} k and then take \lambda -> 0 limit.

imposing finiteness of the action. In this scaling limit, M2-branes are located
far from the origin of C^4/Z_k compared to their fluctuations and Z_k
identification becomes a circle identification. Hence the scaled theory
describes N=8 supersymmetric theory of 2-branes with dynamical coupling. The
coupling constant is promoted to a space-time dependent SO(8) vector X_0^I and
we show that the scaled theory has a generalized conformal symmetry as well as
manifest SO(8) with the transformation of the background fields X_0^I.

interacting light particles, such as axions, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons
from the ADD model, sterile neutrinos and unparticles. We discuss the
possibility for an astrophysical scenario to (dis)confirm new physics for heavy
particles beyond TeV energy scale. In our scenario, the KK protons (the KK
excited quarks/gluons within protons) within the framework of universal extra
dimensions (UEDs), are produced by high energy p + p collisions in Fermi
accelerated environments, with protonic isotropic spectrum d N / d E \propto
E^-2 up to at least 10^18 eV. Thus, because they are also electrically charged,
they should be re-accelerated by mechanism similar to normal protons. The KK
states (no matter whether they have already decayed to the lightest KK particle
or not) should contaminate 10^-5 to 10^-2 of cosmic-ray events for some fixed
energy E (within some suitable assumptions). Hence, if we have techniques to
identify them from air shower data, we can constrain UEDs scenario. Our method
is an ""existence proof"" that we can constrain new physics beyond TeV scale or
much higher by classical astrophysical scenarios, which can also be generalized
to supersymmetric models, the bulk Standard Model fields within the RS model,
and the endlessly emerging new models. Moreover, it can exploit domains which
have no possibility to be studied in terrestrial experiments.

Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) in cosmic rays. We first summarise basic
aspects of cosmic rays, focusing on rays of ultra high energy (UHECRs). We
discuss the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) energy cutoff for cosmic protons,
which is predicted due to photopion production in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). This is a process of modest energy in the proton rest frame.
It can be investigated to a high precision in the laboratory, if Lorentz
transformations apply even at factors $\gamma \sim O(10^{11})$. For heavier
nuclei the energy attenuation is even faster due to photo-disintegration, again
if this process is Lorentz invariant. Hence the viability of Lorentz symmetry
up to tremendous gamma-factors - far beyond accelerator tests - is a central
issue. Next we comment on conceptual aspects of Lorentz Invariance and the
possibility of its spontaneous breaking. This could lead to slightly particle
dependent ``Maximal Attainable Velocities''. We discuss their effect in decays,
Cerenkov radiation, the GZK cutoff and neutrino oscillation in cosmic rays. We
also review the search for LIV in cosmic gamma-rays. For multi TeV gamma-rays
we possibly encounter another puzzle related to the transparency of the CMB,
similar to the GZK cutoff. The photons emitted in a Gamma Ray Burst occur at
lower energies, but their very long path provides access to information not far
from the Planck scale. No LIV has been observed so far. However, even extremely
tiny LIV effects could change the predictions for cosmic ray physics
drastically. An Appendix is devoted to the recent hypothesis by the Pierre
Auger Collaboration, which identifies nearby Active Galactic Nuclei - or
objects next to them - as probable UHECR sources.

find that sensible departures from the Thomson regime can bealready present at

been attributed either to a flared outer disk or to an infalling envelope. We
revisit this issue using detailed radiative transfer calculations to model the
recent, high signal-to-noise data from the IRS instrument on the {Spitzer Space
Telescope}. In the case of FU Ori, we find that a physically-plausible flared
disk irradiated by the central accretion disk matches the observations.
Building on our previous work, our accretion disk model with outer disk
irradiation by the inner disk reproduces the spectral energy distribution
between ~4000 angstroms to ~40 microns. Our model is consistent with
near-infrared interferometry but there are some inconsistencies with
mid-infared interferometric results. Including the outer disk allows us to
refine our estimate of the outer radius of the outbursting, high mass accretion
rate disk in FU Ori as ~ 0.5 AU, which is a crucial parameter in assessing
theories of the FU Orionis phenomenon. We are able to place an upper limit on
the mass infall rate of any remnant envelope infall rate to ~ 7e-7 Msun/yr
assuming a centrifugal radius of 200 AU. The FUor BBW 76 is also well modelled
by a 0.6 AU inner disk and a flared outer disk. However, V1515 Cyg requires an
envelope with an outflow cavity to adequately reproduce the IRS spectrum. In
contrast with the suggestion by Green et al., we do not require a flattened
envelope to match the observations; the inferred cavity shape is qualitatively
consistent with typical protostellar envelopes. This variety of dusty
structures suggests that the FU Orionis phase can be present at either early or
late stages of protostellar evolution.

related to that one of the isotropic system $\Delta_{\rm Casimir}(d)$ via
$\Delta_{\rm Casimir}(d|J_\perp,J_\parallel)=(J_\perp/J_\parallel)^{(d-1)/2}

weak-coupling limit the leading contribution to the real part of geometric
phase is given by the flux of the Dirac monopole plus quadrupole term, and the
expansion for its imaginary part starts with the dipolelike field. For a
two-level system governed by the generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a
formula to compute the non-adiabatic complex geometric phase by integral over
the complex Bloch sphere. We apply our results to to study a two-level
dissipative system driven by periodic electromagnetic field and show that in
the vicinity of the exceptional point the complex geometric phase behaves as
step-like function. Studying tunneling process near and at exceptional point,
we find two different regimes: coherent and incoherent. The coherent regime is
characterized by the Rabi oscillations and one-sheeted hyperbolic monopole
emerges in this region of the parameters. In turn with the incoherent regime
the two-sheeted hyperbolic monopole is associated. The exceptional point is the
critical point of the system where the topological transition occurs and both
of the regimes yield the quadratic dependence on time. We show that the
dissipation brings into existence of pulses in the complex geometric phase and
the pulses are disappeared when dissipation dies out. Such a strong coupling
effect of the environment is beyond of the conventional adiabatic treatment of

  Consider a real reductive algebraic group $G$ acting linearly and rationally
on a real vector space $V$. $G$ can be viewed as the real points of a complex
reductive group $G^\mathbb C$ which acts on $V^\mathbb C := V \otimes \mathbb
C$. Borel-Harish-Chandra show that $G^\mathbb C \cdot v \cap V$ is a finite
union of $G$-orbits; moreover, $G^\mathbb C \cdot v$ is closed if and only if
$G\cdot v$ is closed. We show that the same result holds not just for closed
orbits but for the so-called distinguished orbits. An orbit is called
distinguished if it contains a critical point of the norm squared of the moment
map on projective space. Our main result compares the complex and real settings
to show $G\cdot v$ is distinguished if and only if $G^\mathbb C \cdot v$ is
distinguished.
  In addition, we show that if an orbit is distinguished, then under the
negative gradient flow of the norm squared of the moment map the entire
$G$-orbit collapses to a single $K$-orbit. This result holds in both the
complex and real settings.

and somewhat controversial history of proposed structural assignments and
phase-transition mechanisms. Recently, Zhang and Scott found new indications
that the higher-temperature beta phase has space group I-42d and, by assuming a
group-subgroup relationship between phases, they argued that the
lower-temperature alpha phase should have lower symmetry than that of the
widely-accepted P4_12_12 space group. With this motivation, we use
first-principles calculations to investigate the energy, structure, and local
stability of P4_12_12 and I-42d structures. We also compute the frequencies of
the zone-center phonon modes in both structures, as well as certain
zone-boundary modes in the I-42d structure, and compare with experiment. We
then argue that the various P4_12_12 and I-42d enantiomorphs can be grouped
into three clusters, each of which is identified with a three-dimensional
manifold of structures of P2_12_12_1 symmetry in which the P4_12_12 and I-42d
appear as higher-symmetry special cases. We find that there are relatively high
energy barriers between manifolds, but low barriers within a manifold.
Exploring the energy landscape within one of these manifolds, we find a
minimal-energy path connecting P4_12_12 and I-42d structures with a
surprisingly low barrier of ~5 meV per formula unit. Possible implications for

seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that
give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally

concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to
important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as

of the intracluster medium (ICM) decreases toward the center, the metal
abundance increases. Except for the core (r<~50 kpc), the cluster is hot (~9-10
keV) and is almost isothermal for r<~1 Mpc; the latter contradicts a previous
study. We do not detect the variation of the redshift of the ICM in the
cluster; the upper limit of the velocity difference is 3000 km s^-1. The iron
line ratios in X-ray spectra indicate that the ICM has reached the ionization
equilibrium state. From these results, we conclude that the Ophiuchus cluster
is not a major merger cluster but one of the hottest clusters with a cool core.
We obtain the upper limit of non-thermal emission from the cluster, which is
consistent with both the recent claimed detection with INTEGRAL and the recent
upper limits with the Swift/BAT. If the cluster has bright non-thermal emission

synchrotron emission from the inside of the remnant is from the outward shock,
but projected toward the inner ring, or from the inner shell. We tackle this
problem by employing a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution technique and measuring
spectral indices in the 4.2-6 keV band.
  We show that most of the continuum emission is coming from an inner ring that
coincides with the location of the reverse shock. This inner ring includes
filaments, whose X-ray emission has been found to be dominated by X-ray
synchrotron emission. The X-ray emission from these filaments, both at the
forward shock and from the inner ring, have relatively hard spectra with
spectral index > -3.1. The regions emitting hard X-ray continuum contribute
about 54% of the total X-ray emission in the 4.2-6 keV. This is lower than
suggested by extrapolating the hard X-ray spectrum as measured by BeppoSAX-PDS
and INTEGRAL. This can be reconciled by assuming a gradual steepening of the
spectrum toward higher energies. We argue that the X-ray synchrotron emission
is mainly coming from the Western part of the reverse shock. The reverse shock
in the West is almost at rest in our observation frame, corresponding to a
relatively high reverse shock velocity of ~6000 km/s in the frame of the freely

still unclear. HST/ACS data for the rich cluster population in the interacting
galaxy M51 enables us to investigate this in more detail. We investigate
whether the cluster luminosity function (LF) in M51 shows evidence for an upper
limit to the mass function. The variations of the LF parameters with position
on the disk are addressed. We determine the cluster LF for all clusters in M51
falling within our selection criteria, as well as for several subsets of the
sample. In that way we can determine the properties of the cluster population
as a function of galactocentric distance and background intensity. By comparing
observed and simulated LFs we can constrain the underlying cluster initial mass
function and/or cluster disruption parameters. A physical upper mass limit for
star clusters will appear as a bend dividing two power law parts in the LF, if
the cluster sample is large enough to sample the full range of cluster masses.
The location of the bend in the LF is indicative of the value of the upper mass
limit. The slopes of the power laws are an interplay between upper masses,
disruption and fading. The LF of the cluster population of M51 is better
described by a double power law than by a single power law. We show that the
cluster initial mass function is likely to be truncated at the high mass end.
We conclude from the variation of the LF parameters with galactocentric
distance that both the upper mass limit and the cluster disruption parameters
are likely to be a function of position in the galactic disk. At higher
galactocentric distances the maximum mass is lower, cluster disruption slower,
or both.

unusual to most of the previously known radio-loud NLS1 AGN, but are
reminiscent of blazars. These include flat radio spectra, large amplitude flux
and spectral variability, compact VLBI cores, very high brightness temperatures
derived from variability, enhanced optical emission in excess of the normal
ionising continuum, flat X-ray spectra, and blazar-like SEDs. We interpret them
as evidence for the postulated blazar nature of these very radio-loud NLS1 AGN,
which might possess at least moderately relativistic jets. Intrinsically, some
of the objects have relatively low radio power and would have been classified
as radio-intermediate AGN. The black hole masses are estimated to be within
10^{6-8}Msun, and the inferred Eddington ratios are around unity. The results
imply that radio-loud AGN may be powered by black holes with moderate masses
(10^{6-7}Msun) accreting at high rates. We find that a significant fraction of
the objects, despite having strong emission lines, resemble high-energy peaked
BL Lacs (HBL) in their SED. Given the peculiarities of blazar-like NLS1
galaxies, questions arise as to whether they are plain downsizing extensions of
normal radio-loud AGN, or whether they form a previously unrecognised

employ alternative indicators in order to determine whether the reported

non-Gaussianity indicators, based on skewness and kurtosis of large-angle

large angular scales. A distinctive feature of these indicators is that they
provide sky maps of non-Gaussianity of the CMB temperature data, thus allowing
a possible additional window into their origins. Using these indicators, we
find no significant deviation from Gaussianity in the three and five-year WMAP
ILC map with KQ75 mask, while the ILC unmasked map exhibit deviation from
Gaussianity, quantifying therefore the WMAP team recommendation to employ the
new mask KQ75 for tests of Gaussianity. We also use our indicators to test for
Gaussianity the single frequency foreground unremoved WMAP three and five-year

from Gaussianity even with the KQ75 mask. We show that our findings are robust

is obtained. Though Riemannian curvature cannot be neglected since one
considers curved magnetic flux tube axis, the stretch can be neglect since one
only considers the limit of thin magnetic flux tubes. The theorem states that
marginal or slow dynamos along curved (folded), torsioned (twisted) and
non-stretched flux tubes endowed with diffusionless plasma flows, if a
constraint is imposed on the relation between poloidal and toroidal magnetic
fields in the helical dynamo case. A formula for the stretch of flux tubes is
derived. From this formula one shows that the Riemann flux tube is stretched by
an interaction between the plasma flow vorticity and torsion, in accordance
with our physical intuition. Marginal diffusionless dynamos are shown to exist
obtained in the case of flux tube dynamos exponential stretching. Thus slow
dynamos can be obtaining on the flux tube under stretching. Filamentary dynamos
anti-dynamos are also considered. As flux tubes possess a magnetic axis
torsioned filament, it can also be considered as thegerm of a fast dynamo in
flux tubes Riemannian curved space. It is shown that for non-stretched
filaments only untwist and unfold filaments can provide dynamo action in
diffusive case. A condition for exponential stretching and fast dynamos in
filaments is given. These results are actually in agreement with Vishik
argument that fast dynamo cannot be obtained in non-stretched flows. Actually
the flux tube result is the converse of Vishik's lemma.

key emission components: a soft unresolved source with a blackbody temperature
of 1 MK consistent with a neutron star, surrounded by a nonthermal nebula 40''
in diameter exhibiting a power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma =
1.6+/-0.3, typical of a pulsar wind nebula. The implied spin-down luminosity of
the neutron star, assuming a conversion efficiency to nebular flux appropriate
to Vela-like pulsars, is ~10^{35} ergs/s, again typical of objects a few tens
of kyr old. Morphologically, the nebular flux is slightly enhanced along a
direction, in projection on the sky, independently demonstrated to be of
significance in radio polarization observations; we argue that this represents
the orientation of the pulsar spin axis. At smaller scales, a narrow X-ray
feature is seen extending out 5'' from the point source, a distance consistent
with the sizes of resolved wind termination shocks around many Vela-like
pulsars. Finally, we argue based on synchrotron lifetimes in the estimated
nebular magnetic field that DA 495 represents a rare pulsar wind nebula in

flux, of the neutron star's wind, and that this high magnetization factor may

equivalence principle, that in such a scenario the cosmic acceleration felt by
distant standard candles like SNIa depends on the mass of the host system,
being larger in galaxies than in rich clusters. As a consequence, the scatter
in the observed SNIa Hubble diagram has mostly a physical origin in this
scenario: in fact, the SNIa distance modulus is increasing, at fixed redshift,
for SNe that are hosted in isolated galaxies with respect to the case of SNe
hosted in rich galaxy clusters. Due to its strong dependence on the
astrophysical environments of standard candles, we conclude that alternative
non-gravitational mechanisms for the observed accelerated expansion of the
universe can be interestingly contrasted against the standard metric
interpretation of the cosmological acceleration by means of an environmental
analysis of the cosmic structures in which SNIa are found. The possible absence
of such environmental effects would definitely exclude non-gravitational
mechanisms as responsible for the accelerated cosmological expansion and will
therefore reinforce a metric interpretation.

neutrinos and electron-positron pairs of anomalously large multiplicity in
close-to-central $pp$ collisions at LHC. The scenario is based on confining
SU(2) Yang-Mills dynamics of Hagedorn temperature $\sim m_e=511 $keV being
responsible for the emergence of the lightest lepton family and the weak
interactions of the Standard Model. Although cut off by LHC's detectors these
electrons-positron bursts would be seen indirectly by a large defect energy and
thus an anomalously strong decrease of events with interesting high-energy
secondaries for increasing $\sqrt{s}$ . This is because the formation of
superconducting (preconfining) SU(2) hot-spots `steals' a large fraction of
$\sqrt{s}$ subsequently transferring it to a thermal spectrum of electron
neutrinos, electrons, and positrons liberated through evaporation. We thus
propose the detection of electrons and positrons of kinetic energy $\sim m_e$
and photons of energy $\sim 2 m_e$.

present lens models with an Einstein radius of R_E=1.3"" which contains a mass
of M_{dyn}=10^{12 +- 0.5} M_{sol}, where the uncertainty reflects the range of
possible lens redshifts. The putative lens is not detected to J_{lim}=22.0 mag

limit could be as high as 30 M_sol/L_sol for A_V=0 mag. Since the radio source
is optically unidentified (V_{lim}=25.5 mag) and has a radio flux of S_{1.4

$\tilde{S}_{BH}=\pi \tilde{r}_+/2G_3$ as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This
entropy of CS-BTZ black hole satisfies the first-law of thermodynamics and the
area-law but it is slightly different from the shifted-entropy $S_c=\pi
r_+/2G_3+ (1/\mu l)\pi r_-/2G_3$ based on the BTZ black hole with outer $r_+$
and inner horizon $r_-$. In the case of $r_-=0$, $\tilde{S}_{BH}$ represents
the entropy of non-rotating BTZ black hole with the Chern-Simons term
(NBTZ-CS), while $S_c$ reduces to the entropy of NBTZ black hole. It shows that
$\tilde{S}_{BH}$ may be a candidate for the entropy of the CS-BTZ black hole.

from active galactic nuclei (AGN) as well as galactic sources such as
Black-Hole X-ray Binaries. Since the jet speeds cannot be constrained well from
observations, but are generally believed to be relativistic, physical
quantities inferred from observables are commonly expressed in terms of the
unknown beaming parameters: the bulk Lorentz factor and the line-of-sight
angle, usually in their combination as relativistic Doppler factor. This paper
aims to resolve the discrepancies existing in the literature about such
""de-beaming"" of derived quantities, in particular regarding the minimum-energy
magnetic field estimate. The discrepancies arise because the distinction is not
normally made between the case of a fixed source observed with different
beaming parameters and the case where the source projection on the sky is held
fixed. The former is usually considered, but it is the latter that corresponds
to interpreting actual jet observations. Furthermore, attention is drawn to the
fact that apparent superluminal motion has a spatial corollary, here called
""retardation magnification"", which implies that most parts of a relativistic
jet that are actually present in the observer's frame (a ""world map"" in
relativity terminology) are in fact hidden on the observer's image (the ""world

this class of theories black holes can be as light as M_{Planck}/\sqrt{N} and
be produced in particle collisions above this energy. We show, that the micro
black holes must come in the same variety as the species do, although their
label is not associated with any conserved charge measurable at large
distances. In contrast with big Schwarzschildian ones, the evaporation of the
smallest black holes is maximally undemocratic and is biased in favor of
particular species. With an increasing mass the democracy characteristic to the
usual macro black holes is gradually regained. The lowest possible mass above
which black holes become Einsteinian is \sqrt{N} M_{Planck}. This fact uncovers
the new fundamental scale (below the quantum gravity scale) above which gravity
changes classically, and the properties of black holes and gravity are such as
if some extra dimensions open up, although no such input exists in the theory.
Our observations indicate that geometry of space may be an emergent concept
following from large number of species and the consistency with macro black
hole physics. We apply our findings to the phenomenological properties of the
micro black holes that can be observed at LHC for large N. Extrapolating our
findings to small N, one may ask whether the existence of quark and lepton
flavors is already an evidence for emergent extra dimensions at short

  Graphs",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expander graphs have been recently proposed to construct efficient compressed
sensing algorithms. In particular, it has been shown that any $n$-dimensional
vector that is $k$-sparse (with $k\ll n$) can be fully recovered using
$O(k\log\frac{n}{k})$ measurements and only $O(k\log n)$ simple recovery
iterations. In this paper we improve upon this result by considering expander
graphs with expansion coefficient beyond 3/4 and show that, with the same
number of measurements, only $O(k)$ recovery iterations are required, which is
a significant improvement when $n$ is large. In fact, full recovery can be
accomplished by at most $2k$ very simple iterations. The number of iterations
can be made arbitrarily close to $k$, and the recovery algorithm can be
implemented very efficiently using a simple binary search tree. We also show
that by tolerating a small penalty on the number of measurements, and not on
the number of recovery iterations, one can use the efficient construction of a
family of expander graphs to come up with explicit measurement matrices for
this method. We compare our result with other recently developed
expander-graph-based methods and argue that it compares favorably both in terms
of the number of required measurements and in terms of the recovery time
complexity. Finally we will show how our analysis extends to give a robust
algorithm that finds the position and sign of the $k$ significant elements of
an almost $k$-sparse signal and then, using very simple optimization
techniques, finds in sublinear time a $k$-sparse signal which approximates the
original signal with very high precision.

nuclear receptors in holometabolous insects. Two novelties are observed: the
atypical NR0 gene knirps is present only in brachyceran flies, while the NR2E6
gene is found only in Tribolium and in Apis. Using a quantitative analysis of
the evolutionary rate, we discovered that nuclear receptors could be divided
into two groups. In one group of 13 proteins, the rates follow the trend of the
Mecopterida genome-wide acceleration. In a second group of five nuclear
receptors, all acting together at the top of the ecdysone cascade, we observed
an overacceleration of the evolutionary rate during the early divergence of
Mecopterida. We thus extended our analysis to the twelve classic ecdysone
transcriptional regulators and found that six of them (ECR, USP, HR3, E75, HR4
and Kr-h1) underwent an overacceleration at the base of the Mecopterida
lineage. By contrast, E74, E93, BR, HR39, FTZ-F1 and E78 do not show this
divergence. We suggest that coevolution occurred within a network of regulators
that control the ecdysone cascade. The advent of Tribolium as a powerful model
should allow a better understanding of this evolution.

is a non-zero positive value in many cases of bound states, when a wave
function is a real-valued one and there are no visible motion and flux. This
can be understood, using expansion of the wave function into Fourier integral,
that is, on the basis of virtual plane waves. The ground state energy of a
hydrogen atom is calculated in a special way, regarding explicitly all the
terms of electrostatic and kinetic energies. The correct values of the ground
state energy and the radius of decay are achieved only when the electrostatic
energies of the electron and the proton (self-energies) are not taken into
account. This proves again that self-action should be excluded in quantum
mechanics. A model of a spherical ball with uniformly distributed charge of
particles is considered. It is shown that for a neutral ball (with compensated
electric charge) the electrostatic energy is a non-zero negative value in this
model. This occurs because the self-energy of the constituting particles should
be subtracted. So it shown that the energy of the electric field does not have
to be of a positive value in any imaginable problem.

ejection in a crowded environment is, on the contrary, enhanced or eventually
complete with the help of a pulling force resulting from DNA condensation
induced by the osmotic stress itself. This demonstrates that in vivo, the
osmotically stressed cell cytoplasm will promote phage DNA ejection rather than
resisting it. The further addition of DNA-binding proteins under crowding
conditions is shown to enhance the extent of ejection. We also found some
optimal crowding conditions for which DNA content remaining in the capsid upon

cataclysmic binary systems.
  Instability to the formation of a precessing eccentric disk that attains a
quasi-steady state with mean eccentricity in the range 0.3-0.5 occurs readily.
The shortest growth times are ~15 binary orbits for the largest viscosities and
the instability mechanism is for the most part consistent with the
mode-coupling mechanism associated with the 3:1 resonance proposed by Lubow.
However, the results are sensitive to the treatment of the inner boundary and
to the incorporation of the mass-transfer stream. In the presence of a stream
we found a critical viscosity below which the disk remains circular.
  Incorporation of a mass-transfer stream tends to impart stability for small
enough viscosity (or, equivalently, mass-transfer rate through the disk) and
does assist in obtaining a prograde precession rate that is in agreement with
observations. For the larger q the location of the 3:1 resonance is pushed
outwards towards the Roche lobe where higher-order mode couplings and
nonlinearity occur. It is likely that three-dimensional simulations that
properly resolve the disk's vertical structure are required to make significant
progress in this case.

moment of ~0.35 Bohr magnetons per iron is derived from Mossbauer spectra in

distortion leads to a localization of carriers on Fe, producing small local

the new generation could be a mirror generation with $V+A$ rather than $V-A$

supersymmetric standard model with a light mirror generation (mirMSSM) .
Implications of this extension are explored. One consequence is an enhancement
of the tau neutrino magnetic moment by several orders of magnitude consistent
with the current limits on the magnetic moment of the tau. The masses of the
mirror generation arise due to electroweak symmetry breaking, and if a mirror
generation exists its mass spectrum must lye below a TeV, and thus should be
discovered at the LHC. Mirror particles and mirror sparticles produce many
characteristic signatures which should be detectable at the LHC. Heavy higgs
boson decays into mirror particles and an analysis of the forward-backward
asymmetries can distinguish a mirror generation from a sequential fourth
generation. The validity of the model can thus be tested at the LHC. A model of
the type discussed here could arise from a more unified structure such as grand
unification or strings where a mirror generation escapes the survival
hypothesis, i.e., a generation and a mirror generation do not tie up to acquire
a mass of size $M_{GUT}$ or $M_{string}$ due to a symmetry, and thus remain
massless down to the electroweak scale.

(or its q-deformed counterpart at q= root of unity) and its basic features
naturally include (multipartite) entanglement and braiding. In particular,
q-deformed spin network automata are able to perform efficiently approximate
calculations of topological invarians of knots and 3-manifolds. The same
algebraic background is shared by 2D lattice models supporting topological
phases of matter that have recently gained much interest in condensed matter
physics. These developments are motivated by the possibility to store quantum
information fault-tolerantly in a physical system supporting fractional
statistics since a part of the associated Hilbert space is insensitive to local
perturbations. Most of currently addressed approaches are framed within a
'double' quantum Chern-Simons field theory, whose quantum amplitudes represent
evolution histories of local lattice degrees of freedom.
  We propose here a novel combinatorial approach based on `state sum' models of
the Turaev-Viro type associated with SU(2)_q-colored triangulations of the
ambient 3-manifolds. We argue that boundary 2D lattice models (as well as
observables in the form of colored graphs satisfying braiding relations) could
be consistently addressed. This is supported by the proof that the Hamiltonian
of the Levin-Wen condensed string net model in a surface Sigma coincides with
the corresponding Turaev-Viro amplitude on Sigma x [0,1] presented in the last
section.

constituents is to add particles, one at a time, to an appropriate template.
However, self-organizing molecular and colloidal systems in nature can evolve
in much more hierarchical ways. Specifically, constituents (or clusters of
constituents) may aggregate to form clusters (or clusters of clusters) that
serve as building blocks for later stages of assembly. Here we evaluate the
character and consequences of such collective motion in a set of prototypical
assembly processes. We do so using computer simulations in which a system's
capacity for hierarchical dynamics can be controlled systematically. By
explicitly allowing or suppressing collective motion, we quantify its effects.
We find that coarsening within a two dimensional attractive lattice gas (and an
analogous off-lattice model in three dimensions) is naturally dominated by
collective motion over a broad range of temperatures and densities. Under such
circumstances, cluster mobility inhibits the development of uniform coexisting
phases, especially when macroscopic segregation is strongly favored by
thermodynamics. By contrast, the assembly of model viral capsids is not
frustrated but is instead facilitated by collective moves, which promote the
orderly binding of intermediates consisting of several monomers.

grand unification, a search strategy can be developed that allows to
efficiently find rather large numbers of promising string vacua. Global
string-derived models with the following features are discussed: (i) exact MSSM

couplings with non-trivial mixing; (iv) solution to the mu problem; (v) see-saw

It appears that the decay of the first-collision velocity-correlation

coefficient that depends on the mass and on the coefficient of restitution. We
also obtained the velocity-correlation distribution when the velocity
distributions are not Gaussian: by inserting Sonine corrections of the velocity
distributions, we derive the corrections to the velocity-correlation
