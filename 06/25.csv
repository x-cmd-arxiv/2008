study turbulent transport in triply periodic cubes under the influence of
rotation and anisotropic forcing. Comparison is made with analytical results
obtained via the so-called minimal tau-approximation. Results: In the case
where the turbulence intensity in the vertical direction dominates, the
vertical stress is always negative. This situation is expected to occur in
stellar convection zones. The horizontal component of the stress is weaker and
exhibits a maximum at latitude 30 degrees - regardless of how rapid the
rotation is. The minimal tau-approximation captures many of the qualitative
features of the numerical results, provided the relaxation time tau is close to
the turnover time, i.e. the Strouhal number is of order unity.

estimated using the $\rho\eta\pi$ coupling inferred from the rates and
Dalitz-plot distributions of $\eta\to 3\pi$ decays. The somewhat larger

is estimated from a simple $\bar qq$ model. Both estimates of the $S$-wave part
depend on whether the $a_0(980)$ scalar particle is a $\bar qq$ or some other
(4-quark) state. Finally, we discuss genuinely new, non-$V-A$ scalar weak

this question, which nicely complements that from precision $\beta$ decay
experiments. % In summary, we discuss the possible implications of putative

transverse acoustic impedance to map out the phase diagram of superfluid $^3$He

that the saturation length is almost independent of the wind strength. This
demonstrates that, in contrast with erosion, grain inertia is the dominant

different physical nature we divided the BATSE sample into 5 subsamples
(short1, short2, intermediate, long1, long2) based on their durations and peak
fluxes and studied the angular distributions separately. We used three methods,
Voronoi tesselation, minimal spanning tree and multifractal spectra to search
for non-randomness in the subsamples. To investigate the eventual
non-randomness in the subsamples we defined 13 test-variables (9 from the
Voronoi tesselation, 3 from the minimal spanning tree and one from the
multifractal spectrum). Assuming that the point patterns obtained from the
BATSE subsamples are fully random we made Monte Carlo simulations taking into
account the BATSE's sky-exposure function. The MC simulations enabled us to
test the null hypothesis i.e. that the angular distributions are fully random.
We tested the randomness by binomial test and introducing squared Euclidean
distances in the parameter space of the test-variables. We concluded that the
short1, short2 groups deviate significantly (99.90%, 99.98%) from the fully
randomness in the distribution of the squared Euclidean distances but it is not
the case at the long samples. At the intermediate group the squared Euclidean
distances also give significant deviation (98.51%).

mechanism for producing a frustrated ground state could provide a method of
testing the concept of `avoided criticality' in glassy systems.

is the existence of two nearly critical dynamo eigenmodes, a stable and an

bifurcation, a finite amplitude limit cycle is generated. In the neighbourhood
of the bifurcation, even a small amount of turbulent fluctuations is enough to
generate random reversals of the magnetic field. When the two competing
eigenmodes have different symmetries, this scenario requires a broken symmetry
of the flow that generates the dynamo. This is in good agreement with the
observations of the VKS experiment. It can also explain the dynamics of
planetary or stellar magnetic fields and can be used to understand reversals of
large scale flows that often develop on a turbulent background.

from experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by
X-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting.
For the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the
different components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession
of morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to
be localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is
applied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in
the component and another label in the component complementary. A ""soft""
threshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a
label in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a
problem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected.
So if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image,
these numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome
this problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This
grains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular
material, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity,
deformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.

coupling constant that appears in the partition function of the pure Kodama
state (Chern--Simons functional) and argue that the GKod partition function is
renormalizable as a loop expansion in direct analogy to Chern--Simons
perturbation theory. The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of
1PI vertices uniquely fixed, as a result of the semiclassical-quantum

well-defined effective action for the partition function since the `phase' of
the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective
action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational

Kaluza--Klein theory. Future directions of research include extension of the

a uniform net vertical field and a sinusoidally varying zero net vertical
field. The Athena results agree well with similar studies that used different
numerical algorithms. We conduct analyses to study the flow of energy from
differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. A study of
the temporal correlation between the time derivatives of volume-averaged energy
components shows that energy injected into turbulent fluctuations dissipates on
a timescale of $\Omega^{-1}$, where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency of the
local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although
not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. We
Fourier-transform the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations and,
using the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant, determine
the level of numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and
resolution. By modeling numerical dissipation as if it were physical in origin,
we characterize numerical resistivity and viscosity in terms of effective
Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The resulting effective magnetic Prandtl number
is $\sim 2$, independent of resolution or initial field geometry. MRI
simulations with effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers determined by numerical
dissipation are not equivalent to those where these numbers are set by physical
resistivity and viscosity. These results serve, then, as a baseline for future
shearing box studies where dissipation is controlled by the inclusion of
explicit viscosity and resistivity.

dynamical temperature, given by the mean kinetic energy of the cluster stars,
and a dynamical luminosity, which is defined as the kinetic energy of the stars
leaving the cluster in analogy to the energy of photons emitted by a star, the
dissolution of star clusters is studied using a new dynamical
temperature-luminosity diagram for star clusters. The investigation contains a
parameter-space study of open clusters of up to N = 32768 single-mass stars
with different initial density distributions, half-mass radii, tidal conditions
and binary fractions. The clusters show a strong correlation between dynamical
temperature and dynamical luminosity and most of the investigated cluster
families share a common sequence in such a dynamical temperature-luminosity
diagram. Deviations from this sequence are analyzed and discussed. After core
collapse, the position of a cluster within this diagram can be defined by three
parameters: the mass, the tidal conditions and the binary fraction. Due to core
collapse all initial conditions are lost and the remaining stars adjust to the
given tidal conditions. Binaries as internal energy sources influence this
adjustment. A further finding concerns the Lagrange radii of star clusters:
Throughout the investigated parameter space nearly all clusters show a constant
half-mass radius for the time after core collapse until dissolution.
Furthermore, the ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius evolves onto a
common sequence which only depends on the mass left in the cluster.

mergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by
ellipticals. The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio
of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue
that mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger
mass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and
higher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic
imprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer
profile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In
previous work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed
profiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the
original spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of
observed ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its
tilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more
dissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed
degree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical
mass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed
FP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the
effects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as
disks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.
Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.

strategy, it tempts the practitioner to ignore the role of the stimulus and the
meaning of mutual information. We show here that, as the number of trials

conditional entropy converges to the time-averaged entropy of the conditional

addressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and
multi-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While ""multi-scale"" refers
to employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular
network to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic

cells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the
resolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources
where and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive
power of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.
Using a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four
different computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,
three of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution
simulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we
rank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation
runs versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution
results of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the
underlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked

lensing measurements of substructure in galaxy cluster cores (R<=250kpc/h) at
z=0.2. The dynamic range of the lensing-based substructure fraction
measurements is well matched to the theoretical predictions, both spanning
f_sub~0.05-0.65. The structure formation model predicts that f_sub is
correlated with cluster assembly history. We use simple fitting formulae to
parameterize the predicted correlations: Delta_90 = tau_90 + alpha_90 *
log(f_sub) and Delta_50 = tau_50 + alpha_50 * log(f_sub), where Delta_90 and
Delta_50 are the predicted lookback times from z=0.2 to when each theoretical
cluster had acquired 90% and 50% respectively of the mass it had at z=0.2. The
best-fit parameter values are: alpha_90 = (-1.34+/-0.79)Gyr, tau_90 =
(0.31+/-0.56)Gyr and alpha_50 = (-2.77+/-1.66)Gyr, tau_50 = (0.99+/-1.18)Gyr.
Therefore (i) observed clusters with f_sub<~0.1 (e.g. A383, A1835) are
interpreted, on average, to have formed at z>~0.8 and to have suffered <=10%
mass growth since z~0.4, (ii) observed clusters with f_sub>~0.4 (e.g. A68,
A773) are interpreted as, on average, forming since z~0.4 and suffering >10%
mass growth in the ~500Myr preceding z=0.2, i.e. since z=0.25. In summary,
observational measurements of f_sub can be combined with structure formation
models to estimate the age and assembly history of observed clusters. The
ability to ``age-date'' approximately clusters in this way has numerous
applications to the large clusters samples that are becoming available.

Understanding the power of MIPs in the quantum context raises many open
problems, as there are several interesting models to consider. For example, one
can study the question when the provers share entanglement or not, and the
communication between the verifier and the provers is quantum or classical.
While there are several partial results on the subject, so far no one presented
an efficient scheme for recognizing NEXP (or NP with logarithmic
communication), except for [KM03], in the case there is no entanglement (and of
course no communication between the provers). We introduce another variant of
Quantum MIP, where the provers do not share entanglement, the communication
between the verifier and the provers is quantum, but the provers are unlimited
in the classical communication between them. At first, this model may seem very
weak, as provers who exchange information seem to be equivalent in power to a
simple prover. This in fact is not the case - we show that any language in NEXP
can be recognized in this model efficiently, with just two provers and two
rounds of communication, with a constant completeness-soundness gap.

for configurations with off-shell quarks in the bound state. A correct
treatment of its contribution requires the introduction of a four point

small and large momenta. When the unconstrained degrees of freedom are fixed to

around the Vela SNR, which leads us to believe that the abundance enhancements
are not likely due to metal-rich ejecta. We suggest that the origin of the

general relativity at low energies. In the framework of a recently developed
formalism with variable brane tension one can pose the question, whether it was
always that high? In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper we allow for
temperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law
established by E\""otv\""os. For cosmological branes this assumption leads to
several immediate consequences: (a) The brane Universe was created at a finite
temperature $T_{c}$ and scale factor $a_{\min}$. (b) Both the brane tension and
the 4-dimensional gravitational coupling 'constant' increase with the scale
factor from zero to asymptotic values. (c) The 4-dimensional cosmological
'constant' evolves with $a$, starting with a huge negative value, passing
through zero, finally reaching a small positive value. Such a scale-factor
dependent cosmological constant is able to generate a surplus of attraction at
small $a$ (as dark matter does) and a late-time repulsion at large $a$ (dark
energy). In the particular toy model discussed here the evolution of the brane
tension is compensated by energy interchange between the brane and the fifth
dimension, such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid.
The resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times, a
decelerated phase being followed by an accelerated expansion. The energy
absorption of the brane drives the 5D space-time towards maximal symmetry,
becoming Anti de Sitter.

convergence, and extrapolated numerical results for time spent in the inspiral

an archipelagic nation with more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia has one of the
most abundant living and non-organic oceanic resources. The needs for the
mapping, exploration, and environmental preservation of the vast marine
resources are therefore imperative. The challenge of the deep water exploration
has been the complex issues associated with hazardous and unstructured undersea
and sea-bed environments. The paper reports the design, development and testing

is presented in conjunction with the need to meet the challenge of underwater
vehicle operation. A number of future research directions are also highlighted.

compared to its full-size counterparts due to its increased sensitivity to
control inputs and disturbances and higher bandwidth of its dynamics. As an
aerial vehicle with vertical take-off and landing capability, the helicopter
specifically poses a difficult problem of transition between forward flight and
unstable hover and vice versa. The LPV control technique explicitly takes into
account the change in performance due to the real-time parameter variations.
The technique therefore theoretically guarantees the performance and robustness
over the entire operating envelope. In this study, we investigate a new
approach implementing model identification for use in the LPV control
framework. The identification scheme employs recursive least square technique
implemented on the LPV system represented by dynamics of helicopter during a
transition. The airspeed as the scheduling of parameter trajectory is not
assumed to vary slowly. The exclusion of slow parameter change requirement
allows for the application of the algorithm for aggressive maneuvering
capability without the need of expensive computation. The technique is tested
numerically and will be validated in the autonomous flight of a small scale
helicopter.

dust growth through aggregation is important, knowledge of the way aggregated
particles interact with radiation, and what information is encoded in the
thermal radiation they emit, is needed. The emission characteristics are
determined by the size and structure of the aggregate and the composition and
shape of the constituents. We thus aim at performing computations of
compositionally inhomogeneous aggregates composed of irregularly shaped
constituents. In addition we aim at developing an empirical recipe to compute
the optical properties of such aggregates in a fast and accurate manner. We
performed CDA computations for aggregates of irregularly shaped particles with
various compositions. The constituents of the aggregate are assumed to be in
the Rayleigh regime, and in addition we assume that the dominant interaction of
the aggregate constituents is through dipole-dipole interactions. We computed
the spectral structure of the emission efficiency in the 10 micron region for
aggregates with 30% amorphous carbon and 70% silicates by volume with various
fractions of crystalline and amorphous components. We find that the spectral
appearance of the various components of the aggregate are very different and
depend on their abundances. Most notably, materials that have a very low
abundance appear spectroscopically as if they were in very small grains, while
more abundant materials appear, spectroscopically to reside in larger grains.
We construct a fast empirical approximate method, based on the idea of an
effective medium approximation, to construct the spectra for these aggregates
which almost perfectly reproduces the more exact computations. This new method
is fast enough to be easily implemented in fitting procedures.

sections of $^4$He as well as previous data. The sensitivity of the yields of
all light elements D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^6$Li, $^7$Li and $^7$Be to the cross
sections is investigated. The change of the cross sections has an influence on
the non-thermal yields of D, $^3$He and $^4$He. On the other hand, the
non-thermal $^6$Li production is not sensitive to the change of the cross
sections at this low energy, since the non-thermal secondary synthesis of
$^6$Li needs energetic photons of $E_\gamma \gtrsim 50$ MeV. The non-thermal
nucleosynthesis triggered by the radiative particle decay is one of candidates
of the production mechanism of $^6$Li observed in metal-poor halo stars
(MPHSs). In the parameter region of the radiative particle lifetime and the
emitted photon energy which satisfies the $^6$Li production above the abundance
level observed in MPHSs, the change of the photodisintegration cross sections
at $E_\gamma \lesssim 30$ MeV as measured in the recent experiment leads to
$\sim 10$% reduction of resulting $^3$He abundance, whereas the $^6$Li

includes particle escape and diffusion outside of the forward shock, and
particle interactions with arbitrary distributions of external ambient
material, such as molecular clouds. We include synchrotron emission and
cooling, bremsstrahlung radiation, neutral pion production, inverse-Compton
(IC), and Coulomb energy-loss. Boardband spectra have been calculated for
typical parameters including dense regions of gas external to a 1000 year old
SNR. In this paper, we describe the details of our model but do not attempt a
detailed fit to any specific remnant. We also do not include magnetic field
amplification (MFA), even though this effect may be important in some young
remnants. In this first presentation of the model we don't attempt a detailed
fit to any specific remnant. Our aim is to develop a flexible platform, which
can be generalized to include effects such as MFA, and which can be easily
adapted to various SNR environments, including Type Ia SNRs, which explode in a
constant density medium, and Type II SNRs, which explode in a pre-supernova
wind. When applied to a specific SNR, our model will predict cosmic-ray spectra

formulation of convolution in shapelet space, we construct a procedure to
recover the unconvolved shapelet coefficients under the assumption that the PSF
is perfectly known. Using specific simulations, we test this approach and
compare it to other published approaches. We show that convolution in shapelet
space leads to a shapelet model of order $n_{max}^h = n_{max}^g + n_{max}^f$
with $n_{max}^f$ and $n_{max}^g$ being the maximum orders of the intrinsic
galaxy and the PSF models, respectively. Deconvolution is hence a
transformation which maps a certain number of convolved coefficients onto a
generally smaller number of deconvolved coefficients. By inferring the latter
number from data, we construct the maximum-likelihood solution for this
transformation and obtain unbiased shear estimates with a remarkable amount of
noise reduction compared to established approaches. This finding is
particularly valid for complicated PSF models and low $S/N$ images, which
renders our approach suitable for typical weak-lensing conditions.

stellar neighbour in the northern hemisphere. This proximity makes it a
particularly well suited system for very high accuracy interferometric radius
measurements. Aims: Our goal is to constrain the poorly known evolutionary
status and age of this bright binary star. Methods: We obtained high accuracy
interferometric observations in the infrared K' band, using the CHARA/FLUOR
instrument. We then computed evolutionary models of 61 Cyg A & B with the
CESAM2k code. As model constraints, we used a combination of observational
parameters from classical observation methods (photometry, spectroscopy) as
well as our new interferometric radii. Results: The measured limb darkened disk
angular diameters are theta_LD(A) = 1.775 +/- 0.013 mas and theta_LD(B) = 1.581
+/- 0.022 mas, respectively for 61 Cyg A and B. Considering the high accuracy
parallaxes available, these values translate into photospheric radii of R(A) =
0.665 +/- 0.005 Rsun and R(B) = 0.595 +/- 0.008 Rsun. The new radii constrain
efficiently the physical parameters adopted for the modeling of both stars,
allowing us to predict asteroseismic frequencies based on our best-fit models.
Conclusions: The CESAM2k evolutionary models indicate an age around 6 Gyrs and
are compatible with small values of the mixing length parameter. The
measurement of asteroseismic oscillation frequencies in 61 Cyg A & B would be
of great value to improve the modeling of this important fiducial stellar
system, in particular to better constrain the masses.

scissors-like operator of the form $(\hat{I}-\hat{\rho})\delta

$\hat{\rho}$ the density matrix of the N-particle system and $\delta \hat{H}$

Kohn-Sham virtual orbitals of the $N$-particle system by the HOMO and virtual

the gaps of a variety of small molecules finding good agreement with experiment

which is well fitted to the observed X-ray surface brightness profile except
for outermost region. It employs the exact King model of the self-gravitating
system of collisionless particles instead of the widely used approximated
analytical formula for the dark matter distribution. The small difference
between the modelled and the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles would
disappear if the infall of matter from the intercluster space is taken into
account. The number of parameters of our model is the same as for the
isothermal $\beta$ model, but the agreement between our model and data points
is satisfactory even when the fitting with the isothermal $\beta$ model remains
a large central excess. In addition, the enhanced central mass concentration in
our model is high enough to resolve the discrepancy between the X-ray and the
lensing measurements of cluster mass. These facts suggest that most of the
central excess might be no more than a ghost embossed by an inadequate fitting.
Therefore the central excess would not necessarily be linked to the existence
of cooling flow. It is also shown that the obtained values of $\beta$ (our
model) ~ 0.5 support the theory of non-gravitational intracluster gas heatings
comparable to those reached through gravitational collapse. On the other hand,
the value of $\beta$ ~ 0.6 obtained for the isothermal $\beta$ model is
explained as showing the scarcity of matter in the space surrounding each
cluster, brobably due to the infall of matter towards it over a long time.

binary systems is, the strong perturbation from the companion star can increase
relative velocities ($\triangle V$) of planetesimals around the primary and
thus hinder their growth. According to previous studies, while gas drag can
reduce the $\triangle V$ between bodies of the same sizes by forcing orbital
alignment to planetesimals, it increases the $\triangle V$ among bodies of
different sizes. In this paper, focusing on the $\gamma$ Cephei binary system,
we propose a mechanism that can overcome this difficulty. We show that in a
dissipating gas disk (with a typical dissipating timescale of $\sim 10^5-10^6$
years), all the planetesimals eventually converge towards the same forced
orbits regardless of their sizes, leading to much lower impact velocities among
them. These $\triangle V$ decrease processes progressively increase net mass
accretion and even trigger runaway growth for large bodies (radius $>15$ km).
The effect of size distribution of planetesimals is discussed, and found to be
one of the dominant factors that determine the outcome of collisional
evolution. Anyway, it can be concluded that by including the gas dissipation in
the early stage of disk evolution, the conditions for planetesimal accretion
become much better, and the process from planetesimal to planet-embryo can be
carried out in close binary systems like $\gamma$ Cephei.

Sgr A* on record. This new bright flare exhibits similar light-curve shape
(nearly symmetrical), duration (~3ks) and spectral characteristics to the very
bright flare observed in October 3, 2002. The measured spectral parameters of
the new bright flare, assuming an absorbed power law model taken into account
dust scattering effect, are N_H=12.3(+2.1,-1.8)e22 cm-2 and Gamma~2.3+/-0.3
calculated at the 90% c.l. The spectral parameter fits of the sum of the three
following moderate flares, while lower, are compatible within the error bars
with those of the bright flares. The column density found, for a power-law,
during the flares is at least two times higher than the value expected from the

of the galaxy clearly plays a crucial role in producing observable radio
emission. The dark matter halo masses that we derive for the AGN in our two
samples are in good agreement with recent models in which feedback from radio
AGN becomes dominant in halos where gas cools quasi-statically.

NP-complete class are particularly difficult, it is believed that the number of

NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the
main reasons for this? We adopt approaches from the statistical physics of
disordered systems, in particular the cavity method developed originally to
describe glassy systems. We describe new properties of the space of solutions
in two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random
satisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the
existence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a
problem. Based on these insights, we introduce a new class of problems which we
named ""locked"" constraint satisfaction, where the statistical description is
easily solvable, but from the algorithmic point of view they are even more
challenging than the canonical satisfiability.

assumption that the isometry group is deformed to the Drinfeld double D(SU(2)).
We generalize to the deformed case the construction of the flat Euclidean space
as the quotient of its isometry group ISU(2) by SU(2). We show that the algebra
of functions becomes the non-commutative algebra of SU(2) distributions endowed
with the convolution product. This construction gives the action of ISU(2) on
the algebra and allows the determination of plane waves and coordinate
functions. In particular, we show that: (i) plane waves have bounded momenta;
(ii) to a given momentum are associated several SU(2) elements leading to an
effective description of an element in the algebra in terms of several physical
scalar fields; (iii) their product leads to a deformed addition rule of momenta
consistent with the bound on the spectrum. We generalize to the non-commutative
setting the local action for a scalar field. Finally, we obtain, using harmonic
analysis, another useful description of the algebra as the direct sum of the
algebra of matrices. The algebra of matrices inherits the action of ISU(2):
rotations leave the order of the matrices invariant whereas translations change
the order in a way we explicitly determine.

10^-4 M_sun/yr to overcome the radiation pressure barrier of the forming stars.
Here, we study evolution of protostars accreting at such high rates, by solving
the structure of the central star and the inner accreting envelope
simultaneously. The protostellar evolution is followed starting from small
initial cores until their arrival at the stage of the Zero-Age Main Sequence
(ZAMS) stars. An emphasis is put on evolutionary features different from those
with a low accretion rate of 10^-5 M_sun/yr, which is presumed in the standard
scenario for low-mass star formation. With the high accretion rate of 10^-3
M_sun/yr, the protostellar radius becomes very large and exceeds 100 R_sun. It
is not until the stellar mass reaches 40 M_sun that hydrogen burning begins and
the protostar reaches the ZAMS phase, and this ZAMS arrival mass increases with
the accretion rate. At a very high accretion rate of > 3 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr, the
total luminosity of the protostar becomes so high that the resultant radiation
pressure inhibits the growth of the protostars under steady accretion before
reaching the ZAMS stage. Therefore, the evolution under the critical accretion
rate 3 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr gives the upper mass limit of possible
pre-main-sequence stars at 60 M_sun. The upper mass limit of MS stars is also
set by the radiation pressure onto the dusty envelope under the same accretion
rate at 250 M_sun. We also propose that the central source enshrouded in the
Orion KL/BN nebula has effective temperature and luminosity consistent with our
model, and is a possible candidate for such protostars growing under the high
accretion rate. (abridged)

equations. Here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas
gravitation is described by a Lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton
field (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in
Minkowski spacetime. The graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented
by a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero
of the Lorentz group. Such a field, then (as it is well known), must
necessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) below. Next, we
introduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. Then, using the
Clifford bundle formalism we derive, from our Lagrangian theory, the exact wave
equation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given
by Eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum
tensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in Minkowski spacetime.
Finally we ask the question: does Eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field
g of the effective Lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h
in our theory? We show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the
case in General Relativity. Moreover we investigate under which conditions we
may fix Logunov gauge condition.

resulting branching patterns on the driving chemical potential, the mobility
and concentration of the nanoparticles, and the interaction strength between
liquid and nanoparticles. This allows us to understand the underlying
instability mechanism.

Magellanic Cloud (SMC), performed between October 2006 and June 2007, to
investigate high mass X-ray binary systems. We found new X-ray binary pulsars
with periods of 202 s (XMMU J005929.0-723703), 342 s (XMMU J005403.8-722632),
645 s (XMMU J005535.2-722906) and 325 s (XMMU J005252.1-721715), in the latter
case confirming the independent discovery in Chandra data. In addition we
detected sixteen known Be/X-ray binary pulsars and six ROSAT-classified
candidate high mass X-ray binaries. From one of the candidates, RX
J0058.2-7231, we discovered X-ray pulsations with a period of 291 s which makes
it the likely counterpart of XTE J0051-727. From the known pulsars, we revise
the pulse period of CXOU J010206.6-714115 to 967 s, and we detected the 18.37 s
pulsar XTE J0055-727 (= XMM J004911.4-724939) in outburst, which allowed us to
localise the source. The pulse profiles of the X-ray pulsars show a large
variety of shapes from smooth to highly structured patterns and differing
energy dependence. For all the candidate high mass X-ray binaries optical
counterparts can be identified with magnitudes and colours consistent with Be
stars. Twenty of the Be/X-ray binaries were detected with X-ray luminosities in
the range 1.5x10^35 erg/s - 5.5x10^36 erg/s. The majority of the spectra is
well represented by an absorbed power-law with an average power-law index of
0.93. The absorption (in addition to the Galactic foreground value) varies over
a wide range between a few 10^20 H cm^-2 and several 10^22 H cm^-2. An overall
correlation of the absorption with the total SMC HI column density suggests
that the absorption seen in the X-ray spectra is often largely caused by
interstellar gas.

"0806.4133","Vivek Farias","Vivek Farias and Ritesh Madan","Irrevocable Multi-Armed Bandit Policies","29 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the multi-armed bandit problem with multiple
simultaneous arm pulls. We develop a new `irrevocable' heuristic for this
problem. In particular, we do not allow recourse to arms that were pulled at
some point in the past but then discarded. This irrevocable property is highly
desirable from a practical perspective. As a consequence of this property, our
heuristic entails a minimum amount of `exploration'. At the same time, we find
that the price of irrevocability is limited for a broad useful class of bandits
we characterize precisely. This class includes one of the most common
applications of the bandit model, namely, bandits whose arms are `coins' of
unknown biases. Computational experiments with a generative family of large
scale problems within this class indicate losses of up to 5 to 10% relative to
an upper bound on the performance of an optimal policy with no restrictions on
exploration. We also provide a worst-case theoretical analysis that shows that
for this class of bandit problems, the price of irrevocability is uniformly
bounded: our heuristic earns expected rewards that are always within a factor
of 1/8 of an optimal policy with no restrictions on exploration. In addition to
being an indicator of robustness across all parameter regimes, this analysis
sheds light on the structural properties that afford a low price of
irrevocability.

superconductors. It is attributed either to incoherent Cooper pairing setting
in above the superconducting transition temperature Tc, or to a hidden order
parameter competing with superconductivity. Here we use inelastic neutron
scattering from underdoped YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.6) to show that the dispersion
relations of spin excitations in the superconducting and pseudogap states are
qualitatively different. Specifically, the extensively studied ""hour glass""
shape of the magnetic dispersions in the superconducting state is no longer
discernible in the pseudogap state and we observe an unusual ""vertical""
dispersion with pronounced in-plane anisotropy. The differences between
superconducting and pseudogap states are thus more profound than generally
believed, suggesting a competition between these two states. Whereas the
high-energy excitations are common to both states and obey the symmetry of the
copper oxide square lattice, the low-energy excitations in the pseudogap state
may be indicative of collective fluctuations towards a state with broken
orientational symmetry predicted in theoretical work.
