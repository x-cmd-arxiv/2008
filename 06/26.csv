simulations of disk-planet interaction which incorporate simultaneously
realistic radiation physics and the self-gravity of the gas, as well as
allowing the planet to move. We find that thermodynamics and radiative physics
have a remarkable effect on both migration and accretion of Jupiter mass
planets. In simulations with radiative transfer adopting flux-limited
diffusion, inward migration can be decreased by about 30% relative to the
isothermal case, while in adiabatic runs migration nearly shuts off after a few
tens of orbits. Migration varies because the relative strength of the inner and
outer spiral perturbations is affected by thermodynamics, thus changing the net
torque acting on the planet. Mass accretion rates on the planet can be reduced
by more than an order of magnitude going from isothermal to radiative transfer
and adiabatic simulations. A circumplanetary disk always forms except in
adiabatic runs. With radiative transfer the disk is sub-keplerian (Vrot/Vkep ~
0.7) owing to significant pressure support. We discuss the effect of
circumplanetary disk structure on the drift of embedded dust grains and
planetesimals and thus on the formation of the rocky satellites of giant
planets.

median-stacking FIRST cutouts centered on the optically-selected sources, we
are able to reach flux densities down to the 10s of microJy. The quiescent
galaxy sample is composed of two subgroups inhabiting vastly different regimes:
those targeted for the SDSS MAIN Galaxy Sample (~55%), and those targeted for
the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample (~45%). To investigate the star-formation
rates (SFRs) of these quiescent galaxies, we calibrate a radio-SFR conversion
using a third sample of star-forming galaxies. Comparing this SFR-indicator
with indicators in the optical and UV, we derive conflicting SFR estimates for
the MAIN sample quiescent galaxies. These radio-derived SFRs intersect those
calculated using the 4000-Angstrom break (D4000) around an SFR of 1 Msun/yr and
agree to within a factor of 3 over the range of SFRs. However, we find that the
radio-derived SFRs are too high relative to the SFRs estimated for similar
populations of galaxies using analysis of UV emission, implying either
contamination of the radio by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) or incomplete dust
modeling. If AGN activity is dominant in these galaxies, then a relation
between AGN radio luminosity and galaxy mass is required to explain the
observed trends. For the LRGs, on the other hand, we find the radio luminosity
to be independent of SFR as derived from D4000, indicating an AGN component
dominates their radio emission. AGN-based radio emission often implies the
existence of radio jets, providing evidence of a mechanism for low-level
feedback in these quiescent LRGs. (Abridged)

stellar populations which appear typical of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) systems.
The first of these galaxies, Andromeda XVIII, is the most distant Local Group
dwarf discovered in recent years, at ~1.4 Mpc from the Milky Way (~ 600 kpc
from M31). The second galaxy, Andromeda XIX, a satellite of M31, is the most
extended dwarf galaxy known in the Local Group, with a half-light radius of r_h
~ 1.7 kpc. This is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the typical
half-light radius of many Milky Way dSphs, and reinforces the difference in
scale sizes seen between the Milky Way and M31 dSphs (such that the M31 dwarfs
are generally more extended than their Milky Way counterparts). The third
galaxy, Andromeda XX, is one of the faintest galaxies so far discovered in the
vicinity of M31, with an absolute magnitude of order M_V ~ -6.3. Andromeda
XVIII, XIX and XX highlight different aspects of, and raise important questions
regarding, the formation and evolution of galaxies at the extreme faint-end of
the luminosity function. These findings indicate that we have not yet sampled
the full parameter space occupied by dwarf galaxies, although this is an
essential pre-requisite for successfully and consistently linking these systems

We find that there is a region of WIMP parameter space which can simultaneously
accommodate DAMA and the null results of CDMS, CRESST, and XENON. This region
corresponds to an ordinary, elastically-scattering WIMP with a standard
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a mass 3 GeV < m_{DM} <8 GeV, and a
spin-independent cross section with nucleons 3 \times 10^{-41} cm^2 <
\sigma_p^{SI} < 5 \times 10^{-39} cm^2. This new region of parameter space
depends crucially on the recently discovered effect of channeling on the energy
threshold for WIMP detection in the DAMA experiment; without the inclusion of
this effect, the DAMA allowed region is essentially closed by null experiments.
Such low-mass WIMPs arise in many theories of Beyond the Standard Model
physics, from minimal extensions of the MSSM to solutions of the baryon-dark
matter coincidence problem. We find that inelastic scattering channels do not
open up a significant parameter region consistent with all experimental
results. Future experiments with low energy thresholds for detecting nuclear
recoils, such as CDMSII-Si and those utilizing ultra-low energy germanium
detectors, will be able to probe the DAMA region of parameter space.

stars which, at variance with radio pulsars, are mostly radio silent and not
powered by the star rotation. Among these objects are the magnetars,
hyper-magnetized neutron stars characterized by transient X-ray/gamma-ray
emission, and neutron stars with purely thermal, and in most cases stationary,
X-ray emission (a.k.a., X-ray dim isolated neutron stars or XDINSs). While
apparently dissimilar in their high-energy behavior and age, both magnetars and
XDINSs have similar periods and unusually high magnetic fields. This suggests a
tantalizing scenario where the former evolve into the latter.Discovering so far
uninvestigated similarities between the multi-wavelength properties of these
two classes would be a further step forward to establish an evolutionary
scenario. A most promising channels is the near infrared (NIR) one, where
magnetars are characterized by a distinctive spectral flattening with respect
to the extrapolation of the soft X-ray spectrum.We observed the two XDINSs RX

control operating on the picosecond or faster timescale may be necessary. Such
speeds, which are not possible to attain with standard electron spin resonance
(ESR) techniques based on microwave sources, can be attained with broadband
optical pulses. One promising ultrafast technique utilizes single broadband
pulses detuned from resonance in a three-level Lambda system [4]. This
attractive technique is robust against optical pulse imperfections and does not
require a fixed optical reference phase. Here we demonstrate the principle of
coherent manipulation of spins theoretically and experimentally. Using this
technique, donor-bound electron spin rotations with single-pulse areas
exceeding pi/4 and two-pulses areas exceeding pi/2 are demonstrated. We believe
the maximum pulse areas attained do not reflect a fundamental limit of the
technique and larger pulse areas could be achieved in other material systems.
This technique has applications from basic solid-state ESR spectroscopy to
arbitrary single-qubit rotations [4, 5] and bang-bang control[6] for quantum

magnetic tower jets in a galaxy cluster environment, which has been discussed
in a series of our papers. The profile of underlying ambient gas plays an
important role in jet-lobe morphology. The balance between the magnetic
pressure generated by axial current and the ambient gas pressure can determine
the lobe radius. The jet body is confined jointly by the external pressure and
gravity inside the cluster core radius R_c, while outside R_c it expands
radially to form fat lobes in a steeply decreasing ambient thermal pressure
gradient. The current-carrying jets are responsible for generating a strong,
tightly wound helical magnetic field. This magnetic configuration will be
unstable against the current-driven kink mode and it visibly grows beyond R_c
where a separation between the jet forward and return currents occurs. The
reversed pinch profile of global magnetic field associated with the jet and
lobes produces projected B-vector distributions aligned with the jet flow and
the lobe edge. AGN-driven shock powered by the expanding magnetic tower jet
surrounds the jet/lobe structure and heats the ambient ICM. The lobes expand
subsonically; no obvious hot spots are produced at the heads of lobes. Several
key features in our MHD modeling may be qualitatively supported by the
observations of Hercules A.

intracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety

greater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the

  The effect of spatial attention is studied in a model of two inter-connected
visual areas, under two hypothesis that do not necessarily contradict. The
first hypothesis is that attention alters inter-areal feedback synaptic
strength, as has been proposed by many previous studies. A second new
hypothesis is that attention effectively alters single neuron input-output
properties. We show that with both mechanisms it is possible to achieve
attentional effects similarly to those observed in experiments, namely
contrast-gain and response-gain effects, while keeping the orientation-tuning
curves width approximately contrast-invariant and attention-invariant.
Nevertheless, some differences occur and are discussed. We propose a simple
test on existing data based on the second hypothesis.

all-fiber measurement setup, which is the accuracy to which the optical
coupling level and optical losses are known relative to typical free-space
excitation techniques. This allows for precise knowledge of the intracavity
photon number and measurement of absolute transmitted and reflected signals.
Resonant optical spectroscopy of the system under both weak and strong driving
conditions are presented, which when compared with a quantum master equation
model of the system allows for determination of the coherent coupling rate
between QD exciton and optical cavity mode, the different levels of elastic and
inelastic dephasing of the exciton state, and the position and orientation of
the QD within the cavity. Pump-probe measurements are also performed in which a
far off-resonant red-detuned control laser beam is introduced into the cavity.
Rather than producing a measurable ac-Stark shift in the exciton line of the
QD, we find that this control beam induces a saturation of the resonant system
response. The broad photoluminescence spectrum resulting from the presence of
the control beam in the cavity points to sub-bandgap absorption in the
semiconductor, and the resulting free-carrier generation, as the likely source
of system saturation.

geometry is in good agreement with optical observations that show a similar
structure in absorption, aligned perpendicular to bipolar scattered light
nebulae. However, the interferometric data also clearly demonstrate that the
submillimeter continuum emission is not centrally concentrated, but rather
appears to have a toroidal geometry with substantially lower intensities inside
a radius of ~250-300 AU. Spatially resolved emission from the CO J=3-2
transition exhibits a velocity gradient along the major axis of the dust
structure. If this kinematic pattern is interpreted as the signature of
rotation around a central object, a relatively low mass is inferred (M_star =

implementation of the resonating valence bond (RVB) idea. Actually one the aim
of the present work is to investigate how the bonding of two water molecules,
as a prototype of the hydrogen-bonded complexes, could be described within an
JAGP approach. Using a pseudopotential for the inert core of the Oxygen, with a
full optimization of the variational parameters, we obtain at the VMC level a
binding energy of -4.5(0.1) Kcal/mol, while LRDMC calculations gives -4.9(0.1)
Kcal/mol (experiment 5 Kcal/Mol). The calculated dispersion curve reproduces
both at the VMC and LRDMC level the miminum position and the curvature.The
quality of the WF gives us the possibility to dissect the binding energy in
different contributions by appropriately switching off determinantal and
Jastrow terms in the JAGP: we estimate the dynamical contribution to the
binding energy to be of the order of 1.4(0.2) Kcal/Mol whereas the covalent
contribution about 1.0(0.2) Kcal/Mol. JAGP reveales thus a promising WF for
describing systems where both dispersive and covalent forces play an important
role.

which can be measured independently of distance, varies smoothly with
luminosity. This suggests that SNe Ia are a single family of events. Similar
correlations are observed between luminosity and spectral properties. In
particular, the ratio of the strengths of the SiII \lambda 5972 and \lambda
6355 lines, known as R(SiII), was suggested as a potential luminosity
indicator. Here, the physical reasons for the observed correlation are
investigated. A Monte-Carlo code is used to construct a sequence of synthetic
spectra resembling those of SNe with different luminosities near B maximum. The
influence of abundances and of ionisation and excitation conditions on the
synthetic spectral features is investigated. The ratio R(SiII) depends
ssentially on the strength of SiII \lambda 5972, because SiII \lambda 6355 is
saturated. In less luminous objects, SiII \lambda 5972 is stronger because of a
rapidly increasing SiII/SiIII ratio. Thus, the correlation between R(SiII) and
luminosity is the effect of ionisation balance. The SiII \lambda 5972 line
itself may be the best spectroscopic luminosity indicator for SNe Ia, but all
indicators discussed show scatter which may be related to abundance
distributions.

observable signature of a stellar disk orbiting a central massive black hole.
Debattista et al. 2006 estimated its mass M sim 6 10^6 - 5 10^7 Msun. One of
the most robust means of verifying the existence of a BH is radio continuum
and/or X-ray emission, however because of the deficiency of gas in dEs, radio
continuum emission forms the best option here. We have tried to detect the
X-band radio emission coming from the putative black hole in VCC128 when it
accretes gas from the surrounding ISM. While we made a positive 4 sigma
detection of a point source 4.63'' south-west of the binary nucleus, no
statistically significant evidence for emission associated with the nuclei
themselves was detected.
  This implies either that VCC128 has no massive central black hole, which
makes the nature of the binary nucleus hard to explain, or, if it has a central
black hole, that the physical conditions of the ISM (predominantly its density
and temperature) and/or of the surrounding accretion disk do not allow for
efficient gas accretion onto the black hole, making the quiescent black hole
very hard to detect at radio wavelengths.

limited. Several previous numerical investigations have focused on the impact
of an IMBH on the cluster dynamics or brightness profile. Here we instead
present results from a large set of direct N-body simulations including single
and binary stars. These show that there is a potentially more detectable IMBH
signature, namely on the variation of the average stellar mass between the
center and the half-light radius. We find that the existence of an IMBH
quenches mass segregation and causes the average mass to exhibit only modest
radial variation in collisionally relaxed star clusters. This differs from when
there is no IMBH. To measure this observationally requires high resolution
imaging at the level of that already available from the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) for the cores of a large sample of galactic globular clusters. With a
modest additional investment of HST time to acquire fields around the
half-light radius, it will be possible to identify the best candidate clusters
to harbor an IMBH. This test can be applied only to globulars with a half-light
relaxation time less than or equal to 1 Gyr, which is required to guarantee
efficient energy equipartition due to two-body relaxation.

fundamental disagreements in the predictions of the two models for galaxy
morphology. For example, taking into account uncertainties in the available
observational data, both produce a realistic morphological mix today, but its
evolution is very different. A main cause of this and other differences is the
treatment of disk instabilities which play a more prominent role in the Durham

galaxies form most of their stars before the bulk of the galaxy is assembled.

formation. With the exception of the brightest ellipticals (stellar mass >

which most spheroids (ellipticals and spiral bulges) assemble their mass. In
fact, the majority of ellipticals (and the overwhelming majority of spirals)
never experience a major merger (above the resolution limit of our simulation.)
Most ellipticals and spiral bulges acquire their stellar mass through minor
mergers or disk instabilities. These conclusions are common to both models. The
rotation properties of spheroids may help to constrain the importance of disk
instabilities in these models.

bi-quadratic exchange interactions. Based on quantum Monte Carlo studies on
finite size systems, [K. Harada et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 013703 (2007)]
it has been proposed that this phase transition is second order with new
deconfined fractional excitations that are absent in either of the two phases
[T. Grover and T. Senthil, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 247202 (2007)]. The possibility
of a weak first order transition, however, cannot be ruled out. To elucidate
the nature of the transition, we construct a large-N SO(3N) model for this
phase transition and find in the $N\to\infty$ limit that the transition is
generically of first order. Furthermore, we find a critical point in the 1D
limit, where two transition lines, separating spin nematic, ferromagnetic, and
spin-Peierls phases, meet. Our study indicates that the spin nematic phase is
absent in 1D, while its correlation length diverges at the critical point.
Predictions for $^{23}$Na atoms trapped in an optical lattice, where this
quantum phase transition naturally arises, are discussed.

simply magnetic winds of rapidly-rotating, strongly-magnetized T Tauri stars in
causing the inward or outward migration of close-in giant planets. The
azimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to
increase the planet's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the
star's rotation period $P_*$ is less than the planet's orbital period $P_p$. In
the opposite case, $P_* > P_p$, the planet migrates inward. Thus, planets
orbiting at distances larger (smaller) than $0.06 {\rm AU}(P_*/5{\rm d})^{2/3}$
tend to be pushed outward (inward), where $P_*$ is the rotation period of the
star assumed to have the mass of the sun. The magnetic winds are likely to
occur in T Tauri stars where the thermal speed of the gas close to the star is
small, where the star's magnetic field is strong, and where the star rotates
rapidly. The time-scale for appreciable radial motion of the planet is
estimated as $\sim 2 - 20$ Myr. A sufficiently massive close-in planet may
cause tidal locking and once this happens the radial migration due to the
magnetic wind ceases. The magnetic winds are expected to be important for
planet migration for the case of a multipolar magnetic field rather than a
dipole field where the wind is directed away from the equatorial plane and
where a magnetospheric cavity forms. The influence of the magnetic wind in
eroding and eventually destroying the accretion disk is analyzed. A momentum
integral is derived for the turbulent wind/disk boundary layer and this is used
to estimate the disk erosion time-scale as $\sim 1-10^2$ Myr, with the lower
value favored.

two confidential messages for two respective receivers, while a wire-tapper
also receives the transmitted signal. This model is motivated by wireless
communications, where individual secure messages are broadcast over open media
and can be received by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured
by equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general
(non-degraded) broadcast channel with confidential messages. We present an
inner bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. The inner bound
coding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the
Gelfand-Pinsker bining. This scheme matches the Marton's inner bound on the
broadcast channel without confidentiality constraint. We further study the
situation where the channels are degraded. For the degraded broadcast channel
with confidential messages, we present the secrecy capacity region. Our
achievable coding scheme is based on Cover's superposition scheme and random
binning. We refer to this scheme as Secret Superposition Scheme. In this
scheme, we show that randomization in the first layer increases the secrecy
rate of the second layer. This capacity region matches the capacity region of
the degraded broadcast channel without security constraint. It also matches the
secrecy capacity for the conventional wire-tap channel. Our converse proof is
based on a combination of the converse proof of the conventional degraded
broadcast channel and Csiszar lemma. Finally, we assume that the channels are
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and show that secret superposition scheme
with Gaussian codebook is optimal. The converse proof is based on the
generalized entropy power inequality.

developed at JPL for applications in quantum computing. This concept allows for
frequency multiplexing of a large number of pixels using a single RF line, and

the central protostar. The Class 0 source SMA 2 is associated with a double
radio source, B 9a and 9b, and seems to be driving two outflows. The B 9
complex is probably a multiple-protostar system. Both B 9a and 9b are
nonthermal radio sources with negative spectral indices. IRS 7B is a compact
radio source surrounded by an extended structure. The compact source
corresponds to the Class 0/I source SMA 1, and it is also closely associated

suggesting that energetic magnetic processes are active in both members. The
month-scale active phase of IRS 5b implies that the flare activity must involve
large-scale magnetic fields. During the strong flare event of IRS 5b in 1998,
IRS 5a also showed an enhanced level of radio emission. This concurrent

this implies that the magnetic field is largely dominated by its azimuthal

such configurations are highly unstable in static columns, leading to plasma
disruption. It has long been pointed out that a similar outcome may follow for
MHD jets, and the reasons preventing disruption are still not elucidated,
although some progress has been accomplished in the recent years.
  In these notes, I review the present status of this open problem for
pressure-driven instabilities, one of the two major sources of ideal MHD
instability in static columns (the other one being current-driven
instabilities).
  I first discuss in a heuristic way the origin of these instabilities.
Magnetic resonances and magnetic shear are introduced, and their role in
pressure-driven instabilities discussed in relation to Suydam's criterion. A
dispersion relation is derived for pressure-driven modes in the limit of large
azimuthal magnetic fields, which gives back the two criteria derived by
Kadomtsev for this instability. The growth rates of these instabilities are
expected to be short in comparison with the jet propagation time.
  What is known about the potential stabilizing role of the axial velocity of
jets is then reviewed. In particular, a nonlinear stabilization mechanism
recently identified in the fusion literature is discussed.

We analyze the variabilities of the two components in the complex H$\alpha$
line: one P-Cygni shaped component which follows the motion of the supergiant
and another emission component moving with an antiphase orbital motion relative
to the supergiant, which is attributed to a focused-stellar wind. The results
of KOREL disentangling of our spectra indicate that the focused stellar wind is
responsible for the major part of the variability of the H$\alpha$ emission
line. The emission of the supergiant component had a small difference between
the low/hard and high/soft states, while the focused wind component became
strong in the low/hard state and weak in the high/soft state. The wind is
nearly undisturbed by the X-ray photoionization during the low/hard state.
However, during the high/soft state, the X-rays from the compact object could
decelerate the line-driven wind and result in a high mass accretion rate, due
to the effect of the X-ray photoionization. The X-ray illuminating could also
change the temperature profile of the stellar wind and increase its
temperature, and thus decrease the H$\alpha$ emissivity of the wind, which
could explain the H$\alpha$ variabilities of Cyg X-1 during different X-ray
states.

both the polarization position angle and the Faraday rotation measure (RM).
These distributions are powerful tools to discern the projected and
line-of-sight components of the magnetic field, respectively. We find a
systematic gradient in the RM distribution, with its sign being opposite at
either side of the jet with respect to the jet axis. The sign of the RM changes
only with the direction of the magnetic field component along the line of
sight, so this can be explained by the existence of helical magnetic components
associated with the jet itself. We derive two constraints for the pitch angle
of the helical magnetic field from the distributions of the RM and the
projected magnetic field; the RM distribution indicates that the helical fields
are tightly wound, while that of the projected magnetic field suggests they are
loosely wound around the jet axis. This inconsistency may be explained if the
Faraday rotator is not cospatial with theemitting region. Our results may point
toward a physical picture in which an ultra-relativistic jet (spine) with a
loosely wound helical magnetic field is surrounded by a sub-relativistic wind
layer (sheath) with a tightly wound helical magnetic field.

obtained in armchair ribbons. The addition of long-range Coulomb interactions
opens a gap in the charge sector with a gapless spin sector. In contrast to
armchair terminations, the charge-gap vanishes exponentially with the ribbon
width and its amplitude and decay-length are strongly dependent on the I-SO
coupling. Comparison with reported ab-initio calculations are presented.

  thixotropic materials","23 pages, 8 figures. To appear in Chemical Engineering Science",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work the ageing dynamics of soft solids of aqueous suspension of
laponite has been investigated under the oscillatory stress field. We observed
that at small stresses elastic and viscous moduli showed a steady rise with the
elastic modulus increasing at a faster rate than the viscous modulus. However
at higher stresses both the moduli underwent a sudden rise by several orders of
magnitude with the onset of rise getting shifted to a higher age for a larger
shear stress. We believe that the observed behavior is due to interaction of
barrier height distribution of the potential energy wells in which the particle
is trapped and strain induced potential energy enhancement of the particles.
Strain induced in the material causes yielding of the particles that are
trapped in the shallower wells. Those trapped in the deeper wells continue to
age enhancing the cage diffusion timescale and thereby the viscosity which
lowers the magnitude of strain allowing more particles to age. This coupled
dependence of strain, viscosity and ageing causes forward feedback for a given
magnitude of stress leading to sudden rise in both the moduli. Changing the
microstructure of the laponite suspension by adding salt affected the barrier
heights distribution that showed a profound influence on the ageing behavior.
Interestingly, this study suggests a possibility that any apparently yielded
material with negligible elastic modulus, may get jammed at a very large
waiting time.

Apparently, temporal studies provide independent and complementary information
to the spectral studies, but surprisingly little attention has been paid
especially for the blazar study. Only exception is a classical argument for
presence of ""time lag"", which may (or may not) reflect the diffrence of
synchrotron cooling timescale. Also very recently, it was suggested that the
X-ray variability of TeV blazars indicates a strong red-noise, compared to a
fractal, flickering-noise of Seyfert galaxies. Various temporal techniques are
proposed in literature, e.g., the power spectrum density (PSD), the structure
function (SF), and the discrete correlation function (DCF) and other analysis
tools, but special care must be taken if the data are not well sampled and
observation is relatively short compared to a characteristic timescale of the
system. Also, the situation is being more complicated for low-Earth orbit
satellites, e.g., ASCA, RXTE and BeppoSAX, since the light curve inevitably
contains ""periodic gap"" due to the Earth occultation (every ~6ksec). I will
present detailed approaches to see how the ""gap"" and the ""finite length"" of the

detect possible effects in scales of the order of few Mpc. (methods) The

constant term and, from the numerical solution of the equations of motion, a
velocity-distance relation was obtained. This relation depends on two
parameters: the central core mass and the Hubble parameter. The non-linear fit
of such a relation to available data permitted to obtain masses for five nearby

successfully the main characteristics of the Milky Way for a bulge orientation

onto the young star - a concept which assumes the star-disc system to be
completely isolated. However, in a dense cluster environment star-disc systems
do interact gravitationally. The aim here is to estimate the encounter-induced
accretion rate in an ONC-like environment. Combining simulations of the cluster
dynamics with simulations of the effect of encounters on star-disc systems we
determine the likelihood and degree of encounter-triggered accretion processes.
We show that accretion bursts triggered by encounters of star-disc systems are
common in young dense clusters like the ONC leading in the outburst phase to
typical accretion rates of 10^(-7)-10^(-4) M(sun)/yr. Up to a third of stars
presently in the Trapezium region accreted at least 1% of their disc mass via
this mechanism in the last 1Myr. Accretion of over 6-7% of the disc material
can occur in a single encounter. Despite losing their discs quickly, the total
percentage of disc matter accreted per star is largest for the massive stars.
Supplementing the steady accretion flow there exist episodic periods of high
accretion in dense cluster environments. Due to their high accretion rate these
processes should be observable even now in some of the low-mass stars in the
ONC.

effective action, we solve the flow equations and obtain the renormalized

In the long-distance limit, where the lattice does not matter any more, we

responsible for shaping the generally spherical outflow of evolved stars into

fields during the transition to the planetary nebula phase are rare.
  Aims: The aim of this project is to expand the number of magnetic field
measurements of stars in the (proto-)planetary nebula phase and find if the
magnetic field strength is sufficient to affect the stellar outflow.
  Methods: We used Very Long Baseline Array observations to measure the
circular polarization due to the Zeeman splitting of 22 GHz water masers in the
envelope of the proto-planetary nebula candidate star IRAS 19296+2227 and the
planetary nebula K3-35.
  Results: A strong magnetic field of B||=-135+-28 is detected in the water
maser region of the proto-planetary nebula candidate IRAS 19296+2227. The water
masers of K3-35 are too weak to detect circular polarization although we do
present the measurements of weak linear polarization in those masers.
  Conclusions: The field measured in the masers of IRAS 19296+2227 is
dynamically important and, if it is representative of the large scale field, is
an important factor in driving the stellar mass loss and shaping the stellar
outflow.

Our results are as follows: 1. Of 22 ""early type"" objects, 17 are in fact
misclassified spiral galaxies, one is a misclassified irregular, and one is a
misclassified ring galaxy. 2. Of the 3 objects maintaining the early type
classification, one (NGC2768) is a suspected merger remnant, another (NGC4589)
is definitely a merger, and the third (NGC2274) is in close interaction. The
presence of some amount of young stellar population in these galaxies is
therefore not unexpected. These results confirm the presence of a limited, but
significant, number of core collapse SNe in galaxies generally classified of

increase of resistivity in $CaFe_2As_2$. Such different resistivity response to
SDW ordering is helpful to understand the role played by SDW ordering in
Fe-based high-$T_c$ superconductors. The susceptibility behavior is very
similar to that observed in single crystal $BaFe_2As_2$. A linear temperature
dependent susceptibility occurs above SDW transition of about 165 K. Partial
substitution of Na for Ca suppresses the SWD ordering (anomaly in resistivity)
and induces occurrence of superconductivity at $\sim 20$ K.

covariant Fokker-Planck equation for a simple gas, introduced recently by G.
Chacon-Acosta and G. Kremer (Phys. Rev. E 76, 021201, 2007). The second

systematically from the 1PN microscopic law of force and using the
Klimontovich-Dupree (KD) method. We close the hierarchy by the introduction of
a two-point correlation function that describes adequately the relaxation
process. This picture reveals an aspect that is not considered in the first
formulation: the contribution of ternary correlation patterns to the diffusion
coefficients, as a consequence of the nature of 1PN interaction. Both
formulations can be considered as a generalization of the equation derived by
Rezania and Sobouti (Astron. Astrophys. 54, 1110-1114, 2000), to stellar
systems where the relativistic effects of gravitation play a significant role.

the metric function is functionally dependent of another auxiliary function,

statistical inference remains ever so popular, semi-parametric, Bayesian and

naturally robust and so more appropriate in real-life applications. This
clearly signals for ``beyond parametrics'' approaches which include
nonparametrics, semi-parametrics, Bayes methods and many others. Motivated by
this feature, and his drive in the ``beyond parametrics'' area, we thought that
it will be only appropriate for a volume in honor of Pranab Kumar Sen to focus
on this aspect of statistical inference and its applications. With this in
mind, we have put together this volume in order to (i) review some of the
recent developments in this direction, (ii) focus on some new methodologies and
highlight their applications, and (iii) suggest some interesting open problems

expanded with a many-body basis of Slater Determinants generated by this set of
single-particle states. However, Gamow states have never been studied in the
context of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, except in the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BCS) approximation, where both the upper and lower
components of a quasiparticle wave function are assumed to possess the same
radial dependence with that of a Gamow state associated with the Hartree-Fock

radiation measured at 600 and 820 MHz along a 24 hours right ascension circle

absolute measurements of the sky temperature made with TRIS, an experiment
devoted to the measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature at
decimetric-wavelengths with an angular resolution of about $20^{\circ}$.
  Our analysis confirms the preexisting picture of the galactic diffuse
emission at decimetric wavelength and improves the accuracy of the measurable
quantities. In particular, the signal coming from the halo has a spectral index
in the range $2.9-3.1$ above 600 MHz, depending on the sky position. In the
disk, at TRIS angular resolution, the free-free emission accounts for the 11%
of the overall signal at 600 MHz and 21% at 1420 MHz. The polarized component
of the galactic emission, evaluated from the survey by Brouw and Spoelstra,
affects the observations at TRIS angular resolution by less than 3% at 820 MHz
and less than 2% at 600 MHz. Within the uncertainties, our determination of the
galactic spectral index is practically unaffected by the correction for
polarization.
  Since the overall error budget of the sky temperatures measured by TRIS at
600 MHz, that is 66 mK(systematic)$+$18 mK (statistical), is definitely smaller
than those reported in previous measurements at the same frequency, our data
have been used to discuss the zero levels of the sky maps at 150, 408, 820 and
1420 MHz in literature. Concerning the 408 MHz survey, limiting our attention
to the patch of sky corresponding to the region observed by TRIS, we suggest a
correction of the base-level of $(+3.9\pm 0.6)$K.

transport regimes: At moderate temperatures, above the BKT-like charge
binding-unbinding transition the low bias transport is thermally activated, the

hydrogen through numerical simulations of spiral galaxies. The model follows
the chemical, thermal and dynamical response of the disc to an external spiral
potential. Self-gravity and magnetic fields are not included. The calculations
demonstrate that gas can cool rapidly when subject to a spiral shock. Molecular
clouds in the spiral arms arise through a combination of compression of the ISM
by the spiral shock and orbit crowding. These results highlight that local
self-gravity is not required to form molecular clouds. Self-shielding provides
a sharp transition density, below which gas is essentially atomic, and above
which the molecular gas fraction is >0.001. The timescale for gas to move
between these regimes is very rapid (<~1 Myr). From this stage, the majority of
gas generally takes between 10 to 20 Myr to obtain high H$_{2}$ fractions (>50
%). Although our calculations are unable to resolve turbulent motions on scales
smaller than the spiral arm and do not include self-gravity. True cloud
formation timescales are therefore expected to be even shorter.
  The mass budget of the disc is dominated by cold gas residing in the spiral
arms. Between 50 and 75 % of this gas is in the atomic phase. When this gas
leaves the spiral arm and drops below the self-shielding limit it is heated by
the galactic radiation field. Consequently, most of the volume in the interarm
regions is filled with warm atomic gas. However, some cold spurs and clumps can
survive in interarm regions for periods comparable to the interarm passage
timescale. Altogether between 7 and 40% of the gas in our disc is molecular,
depending on the surface density of the calculation, with approximately 20%
molecular for a surface density comparable to the solar neighbourhood.

mechanism for extra mixing in the radiative zones of low-mass red giants. The
most important revision is our accounting of the heat exchange between rising
magnetic flux rings and their surrounding medium. This increases the buoyant
rising time by five orders of magnitude, therefore the number of magnetic flux
rings participating in the mixing has to be increased correspondingly. On the
other hand, our revised model takes advantage of the fact that the mean
molecular weight of the rings formed in the vicinity of the hydrogen burning
shell has been reduced by 3He burning. This increases their thermohaline
buoyancy (hence, decreases the total ring number) considerably, making it
equivalent to the pure magnetic buoyancy produced by a frozen-in toroidal field
with B_phi ~ 10 MG. We emphasize that some toroidal field is still needed for
the rings to remain cohesive while rising. Besides, this field prevents the
horizontal turbulent diffusion from eroding the mu contrast between the rings
and their surrounding medium. We propose that the necessary toroidal magnetic
field is generated by differential rotation of the radiative zone, that
stretches a pre-existing poloidal field around the rotation axis, and that
magnetic flux rings are formed as a result of its buoyancy-related instability.

string tension for the Nielsen-Olesen vortex in the Abelian Higgs model. The
computations proceeds via the computation of the Euclidean Green's function for
the gauge, Higgs and Faddeev-Popov fields using mode functions, and taking the
appropriate trace. Renormalization is an essential part of this computation, it
is done by removing leading order contributions from the numerical results so
as to make these finite, and to add the divergent parts back, after suitable
regularization and renormalization. We encounter and solve some problems which
are specific to gauge theories and topological solutions. The corrections to
the energy are found to be sizeable, but still smaller than the classical
energy as long as g**2 is smaller than unity.

involves nine dimensionless parameters, which can be bounded by the inferred
absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays
(UHECRs). With selected UHECR events, two-sided bounds on the eight
nonisotropic parameters are obtained at the 10^{-18} level, together with an
improved one-sided bound on the single isotropic parameter at the 10^{-19}
level.
