These spectral curves are then proven to be precisely the hyperelliptic

thus yielding an example of a geometry emerging from an eigenvalue
distribution. We finally discuss the Wilson loop expectation value from the

framework. Within the latter, the very concepts of geometry and gravitational
interaction are not seen as elementary aspects of Nature but rather as
collective phenomena associated to the dynamics of more fundamental objects. In
this paper we want to further explore this possibility by proposing a model of
emergent Lorentzian signature and scalar gravity. Assuming that the dynamics of
the fundamental objects can give rise in first place to a Riemannian manifold
and a set of scalar fields we show how time (in the sense of hyperbolic
equations) can emerge as a property of perturbations dynamics around some
specific class of solutions of the field equations. Moreover, we show that
these perturbations can give rise to a spin-0 gravity via a suitable
redefinition of the fields that identifies the relevant degrees of freedom. In
particular, we find that our model gives rise to Nordstrom gravity. Since this
theory is invariant under general coordinate transformations, this also shows
how diffeomorphism invariance (albeit of a weaker form than the one of general
relativity) can emerge from much simpler systems.

The LFs are estimated by statistically subtracting a reference field.
Background contamination is minimized by cutting out galaxies redder than the
observed red sequence in the g-i vs. i colour-magnitude diagram. The galaxy
distribution shows a significantly flattened cluster, whose principal axis is
slightly offset from the XRF. The analysis of the broad band LFs shows that the
filament region is well populated. The filament is also independently detected
as a gravitationally bound structure by the Serna & Gerbal hierarchical method.
101 galaxies are detected in Ha, among which 23 have spectroscopic redshifts in
the cluster, 2 have spectroscopic redshifts higher than the cluster and 58 have
photometric redshifts that tend to indicate that they are background
objects.The 23 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the cluster are mostly
concentrated in the South part of the cluster and along the filament. We find a
number of galaxies showing evidence for SF in the XRF, and all our results are
consistent with the previous hypothesis that the XRF in A85 is a
gravitationally bound structure made of groups falling on to the main cluster.

transit-time variations (TTV) of the known planet, and transits of the

studies of multiplanet dynamical evolution? First, mutual inclinations become
measurable, for comparison to the solar system's disk-like configuration. Such
measurements will give important constraints to planet-planet scattering
models, just as the RV measurements of eccentricity have done. Second, the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measures stellar obliquity, which can be modified by
two-planet dynamics with a tidally evolving inner planet. Third, TTV is
exquisitely sensitive to planets in mean motion resonance. Two planets
differentially migrating in the disk can establish such resonances, and tidal
evolution of the planets can break them, so the configuration and frequency of
these resonances as a function of planetary parameters will constrain these
processes.

(FRW) Universe, in which the magnetic field was assumed to be too weak to
destroy the isotropy of the model, are known and have been studied in the past.
Accordingly, it became evident that the external magnetic field disfavors the
perturbations' growth, suppressing the corresponding rate by an amount
proportional to its strength. However, the spatial isotropy of the FRW Universe
is not compatible with the presence of large-scale magnetic fields. Therefore,
in this article we use the general-relativistic (GR) version of the
(linearized) perturbed magnetohydrodynamic equations with and without
resistivity, to discuss a generalized Jeans criterion and the potential
formation of density condensations within a class of homogeneous and
anisotropically expanding, self-gravitating, magnetized fluids in curved
space-time. We find that, for a wide variety of anisotropic cosmological
models, gravito-magnetic instabilities can lead to sub-horizonal, magnetized
condensations. In the non-resistive case, the power spectrum of the unstable
cosmological perturbations suggests that most of the power is concentrated on
large scales (small k), very close to the horizon. On the other hand, in a
resistive medium, the critical wave-numbers so obtained, exhibit a delicate
dependence on resistivity, resulting in the reduction of the corresponding
Jeans lengths to smaller scales (well bellow the horizon) than the
non-resistive ones, while increasing the range of cosmological models which
admit such an instability.

supergravity. This leads to a working definition of decoupling in N=1
supergravity that is different from the usual condition of gravitational
strength couplings between sectors, and that is the relevant one for inflation
with moduli stabilization, where some light fields (the inflaton) can have long
excursions in field space. It is also important for finding de Sitter vacua in
flux compactifications and KKLT scenarios, since failure of the decoupling
condition invalidates the implicit assumption that the stabilization and
uplifting potentials have a low energy supergravity description.

the Kahler invariant function G = K + log |W|^2 is of the form G = L(light,
(heavy)) with H and L arbitrary functions, which includes the particular case G
= L(light) + H(heavy). The consistency condition does not hold in general for
the ansatz K = K(light) + K(heavy), W = W(light) + W(heavy) and we discuss
under what circumstances it does hold.

to the space of extended events associated with strings/branes, corresponding
to points, lines, areas, 3-volumes, and 4-volumes in $M_4$. All those objects
can be elegantly represented by the Clifford numbers $X\equiv x^A \gamma_A
\equiv x^{a_1 ...a_r} \gamma_{a_1 ...a_r}, r=0,1,2,3,4$. This leads to the
concept of the so-called Clifford space ${\cal C}$, a 16-dimensional manifold
whose tangent space at every point is the Clifford algebra ${\cal C \ell
}(1,3)$. The latter space besides an algebra is also a vector space whose
elements can be rotated into each other in two ways: (i) either by the action
of the rotation matrices of SO(8,8) on the components $x^A$ or (ii) by the left
and right action of the Clifford numbers $R=$exp$ [\alpha^A \gam_A]$ and
$S=$exp$ [\beta^A \gam_A]$ on $X$. In the latter case, one does not recover all
possible rotations of the group SO(8,8). This discrepancy between the
transformations (i) and (ii) suggests that one should replace the tangent space
${\cal C \ell}(1,3)$ with a vector space $V_{8,8}$ whose basis elements are
generators of the Clifford algebra ${\cal C \ell}(8,8)$, which contains the Lie
algebra of the exceptional group E$_8$ as a subspace. E$_8$ thus arises from
the fact that, just as in the spacetime $M_4$ there are $r$-volumes generated
by the tangent vectors of the spacetime, there are $R$-volumes,
$R=0,1,2,3,...,16$, in the Clifford space ${\cal C}$, generated by the tangent

kinetic k-field one can possibly construct dark energy models whose equation of
state parameter $\wx$ crosses -1 (the phantom barrier) at recent red-shifts, as
indicated by the Supernova Ia and other observational probes. However, such
models may suffer from cosmological instabilities, as the effective speed of
propagation $\cx$ of the dark energy density perturbations may become {\it

for $\cx$ we show that multiple kinetic k-essence fields do indeed lead to a
$\wx = -1$ crossing dark energy model, satisfying the stability criterion
$\cx^2 \geq 0$ as well as the condition $\cx \leq 1$ (in natural units), which
implies that the dark energy is not super-luminal. As a specific example, we
construct a phantom barrier crossing model involving three k-fields for which
$\cx$ is a constant, lying between 0 and 1. The model fits well with the latest
Supernova Ia Union data, and the best fit shows that $\wx$ crosses -1 at

Given a graph $G$ and a subset $\mathcal{T}$ of $k$ vertices of $V(G)$, a
$k$-fixed-endpoint path cover of $G$ with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of
vertex-disjoint paths $\mathcal{P}$ that covers the vertices of $G$ such that
the $k$ vertices of $\mathcal{T}$ are all endpoints of the paths in
$\mathcal{P}$. The kPC problem is to find a $k$-fixed-endpoint path cover of

problem coincides with the classical path cover problem. In this paper, we
study the 1-fixed-endpoint path cover problem on interval graphs, or 1PC for

even for small classes of graphs. Motivated by a work of Damaschke, where he
left both 1HP and 2HP problems open for the class of interval graphs, we show
that the 1PC problem can be solved in polynomial time on the class of interval

prove a Mourre estimate outside a set of thresholds and prove the existence of

scattering theory, which means that the CCR representation given by the
asymptotic fields is of Fock type, with the asymptotic vacua equal to bound
states of $H$. As a consequence $H$ is unitarily equivalent to a collection of
second quantized Hamiltonians. An important role in the proofs is played by the
{\em higher order estimates}, which allow to control powers of the number
operator by powers of the resolvent. To obtain these estimates some conditions

Lyman-alpha blob discovered by Smith & Jarvis, a candidate for ionization by
the cold accretion scenario discussed in Fardal et al. and Dijkstra et al. We
have observed the counterpart galaxy at infrared wavelengths in deep
observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope using the IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 &
8.0 micron and MIPS 24 micron bands, as well as using the Max-Planck Millimeter
Bolometer Array at a wavelength of 1.2mm with the IRAM 30 metre telescope.
These observations probe the > 95kpc Lyman-alpha halo for the presence of
obscured AGN components or the presence of a violent period of star formation
invoked by other models of ionisation for these mysterious objects. 24 micron
observations suggest that an obscured AGN would be insufficiently luminous to
ionize the halo, and that the star formation rate within the halo may be as low
as <140 Msolar/yr depending on the model SED used. This is reinforced by our
observations at 1.2mm using MAMBO-2, which yield an upper limit of SFR <550
Msolar/yr from our non-detection to a 3 sigma flux limit of 0.86 mJy/beam.
Finding no evidence for either AGN or extensive star formation, we conclude
that this halo is ionised by a cold accretion process. We derive model SEDs for
the host galaxy, and use the Bruzual & Charlot and Maraston libraries to show
that the galaxy is well described by composite stellar populations of total
mass 3.42 +/- 0.13 x 10^11 Msolar or 4.35 +/- 0.16 x 10^11 Msolar depending on
the model SEDs used.

separated by only 2.5 kpc, thus merging at z<0.5 increases the BGG mass by >40%
(merging timescale<2 Gyr) and V-band luminosity by ~0.4 mag. The BGGs'
rest-frame (B-V) colors correspond to stellar ages of >3 Gyr, and their tight
scatter in (B-V) color [sigma(BV)=0.032] confirms they formed the bulk of their
stars at z>0.9. Optical spectroscopy shows no signs of recent (<1.5 Gyr) or
ongoing star formation. Only two BGGs are weakly detected at 24 microns, and
X-ray and optical data indicate the emission in BGG-2 is due to an AGN. All
four BGGs and their companions are early-type (bulge-dominated) galaxies, and
they are embedded in diffuse stellar envelopes up to ~140 kpc across. The four
BGG systems must evolve into the massive, red, early-type galaxies dominating
local clusters. Our results show that: 1) massive galaxies in groups and
clusters form via dissipationless merging; and 2) the group environment is

Empirical colour-metallicity relationships are derived for all optical to

  These colours prove to be very effective quantities to test the photometric
predictions of simple stellar population (SSP) models. In general, four SSP
models show larger discrepancies between each other and the data at bluer
wavelengths, especially at high metallicities. Such differences become very
important when attempting to use colour-colour model predictions to constrain
the ages of stellar populations. Furthermore, the age-substructure determined
from colour-colour diagrams and 91 NGC 5128 GCs with spectroscopic ages from
Beasley et al. (2008) are inconsistent, suggesting any apparent GC system
age-substructure implied by a colour-colour analysis must be verified
independently.
  Unlike blue wavebands, certain optical to mid-IR colours are insensitive to
the flux from hot horizontal branch stars and thus provide an excellent
metallicity proxy. The NGC 5128 GC system shows strong bimodality in the
optical R-band to mid-IR colour distributions, hence proving it is bimodal in
metallicity. In this new colour space, a colour-magnitude trend, a ""blue tilt"",
is found in the NGC 5128 metal-poor GC data. The NGC 5128 young GCs do not
contribute to this trend. [abridged]

  978-986, New York, NY, Jan. 2009",,,"math.NA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a fixed matrix, the problem of column subset selection requests a
column submatrix that has favorable spectral properties. Most research from the
algorithms and numerical linear algebra communities focuses on a variant called
rank-revealing {\sf QR}, which seeks a well-conditioned collection of columns
that spans the (numerical) range of the matrix. The functional analysis
literature contains another strand of work on column selection whose
algorithmic implications have not been explored. In particular, a celebrated
result of Bourgain and Tzafriri demonstrates that each matrix with normalized
columns contains a large column submatrix that is exceptionally well
conditioned. Unfortunately, standard proofs of this result cannot be regarded
as algorithmic.
  This paper presents a randomized, polynomial-time algorithm that produces the
submatrix promised by Bourgain and Tzafriri. The method involves random
sampling of columns, followed by a matrix factorization that exposes the
well-conditioned subset of columns. This factorization, which is due to
Grothendieck, is regarded as a central tool in modern functional analysis. The
primary novelty in this work is an algorithm, based on eigenvalue minimization,
for constructing the Grothendieck factorization. These ideas also result in a
novel approximation algorithm for the $(\infty, 1)$ norm of a matrix, which is
generally {\sf NP}-hard to compute exactly. As an added bonus, this work
reveals a surprising connection between matrix factorization and the famous
{\sc maxcut} semidefinite program.

momentum larger than Fermi momentum by hard probes finally proved unambiguously
the evidence for long sought presence of short-range correlations (SRCs) in
nuclei. In combination with the analysis of large $Q^2$, A(e,e')X processes at
$x>1$ they allow us to conclude that (i) practically all nucleons with momenta
$\ge$ 300 MeV/c belong to SRCs, consisting mostly of two nucleons, ii)
probability of such SRCs in medium and heavy nuclei is $\sim 25%$, iii) a fast
removal of such nucleon practically always leads to emission of correlated
nucleon with approximately opposite momentum, iv) proton removal from
two-nucleon SRCs in 90% of cases is accompanied by a removal of a neutron and
only in 10% by a removal of another proton. We explain that observed absolute
probabilities and the isospin structure of two nucleon SRCs confirm the
important role that tensor forces play in internucleon interactions. We find
also that the presence of SRCs requires modifications of the Landau Fermi
liquid approach to highly asymmetric nuclear matter and leads to a
significantly faster cooling of cold neutron stars with neutrino cooling
operational even for $N_p/N_n \le 0.1$. The effect is even stronger for the
hyperon stars. Theoretical challenges raised by the discovered dominance of
nucleon degrees of freedom in SRCs and important role of the spontaneously
broken chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in resolving them are
considered. We also outline directions for future theoretical and experimental
studies of the physics relevant for SRCs.

different amounts of baryon asymmetries in detail.

assumptions of axisymmetry and symmetry across the disc plane. However, for
turbulent discs these symmetries only apply to averaged quantities and do not
apply locally. The local asymmetries can induce local imbalances in outflow
power across the disc mid-plane, which can in turn induce local tilting
torques. Here we calculate the effect of the resulting stochastic torques on
disc annuli that are a consequence of standard mean field accretion disc
models. The torques induce a random walk of the vector perpendicular to the
plane of each averaged annulus. This random walk is characterized by a radially
dependent diffusion coefficient which we calculate for small angle tilt. We use
the coefficient to calculate a radially dependent time scale for annular tilt
and associated jet wobble. The wobble time depends on the square of the wander
angle so the age of a given system determines the maximum wobble angle. We
apply this to examples of blazars, young stellar objects and binary engines of
pre-planetary nebulae and microquasars. It is noteworthy that for an averaging
time $t_w\sim 3$ days, we estimate a wobble angle for jets in SS433 of
$\theta\sim 0.8$ degrees, not inconsistent with observational data. In general
the non-periodic nature of the stochastic wobble could distinguish it from
faster periodic jet precession.

p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products''
at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to
approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms
can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for
applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one
projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative
projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical
analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic
strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are
non-negative, which is common in reality.

perspectives. Firstly, we study features of the main phase of the flare, when
the strongest emissions from microwaves up to 200 MeV gamma-rays were observed.
Secondly, we relate our results to a long-standing controversy on the origin of
SEPs arriving at Earth, i.e., acceleration in flares, or shocks ahead of CMEs.
All emissions from microwaves up to 2.22 MeV line gamma-rays during the main
flare phase originated within a compact structure located just above sunspot
umbrae. A huge radio burst with a frequency maximum at 30 GHz was observed,
indicating the presence of a large number of energetic electrons in strong
magnetic fields. Thus, protons and electrons responsible for flare emissions
during its main phase were accelerated within the magnetic field of the active
region. The leading, impulsive parts of the GLE, and highest-energy gamma-rays
identified with pi^0-decay emission, are similar and correspond in time. The
origin of the pi^0-decay gamma-rays is argued to be the same as that of lower
energy emissions. We estimate the sky-plane speed of the CME to be 2000-2600
km/s, i.e., high, but of the same order as preceding non-GLE-related CMEs from
the same active region. Hence, the flare itself rather than the CME appears to
determine the extreme nature of this event. We conclude that the acceleration,
at least, to sub-relativistic energies, of electrons and protons, responsible
for both the flare emissions and the leading spike of SEP/GLE by 07 UT, are
likely to have occurred simultaneously within the flare region. We do not rule
out a probable contribution from particles accelerated in the CME-driven shock
for the leading GLE spike, which seemed to dominate later on.

type may recover with a rate $\gamma$ and from then on stay immune. Due to the
coupling between the different individuals, the model is nonlinear and out of
equilibrium. We adopt a stochastic individual-based description where
individuals are represented by nodes of a graph and contact is defined by the
links of the graph. Mapping the underlying Master equation into a quantum
formulation in terms of spin operators, the hierarchy of evolution equations
can be solved exactly for arbitrary initial conditions on a linear chain. In
case of uncorrelated random initial conditions the exact time evolution for all
three individuals of the SIR model is given analytically. Depending on the
initial conditions and reaction rates $\beta$ and $\gamma$, the $I$-population
may increase initially before decaying to zero. Due to fluctuations, isolated
regions of susceptible individuals evolve and unlike in the standard mean-field
SIR model one observes a finite stationary distribution of the $S$-type even
for large population size. The exact results for the ensemble averaged
population size are compared with simulations for single realizations of the

from sabbaticals, he has been ever since. In a career of over 45 years, David
has made many fine contributions to probability and statistical theory, and to
the application of statistics. His early research was on Markov chains and
martingales, and two topics with which he has had a lifelong fascination:
exchangeability and De Finetti's theorem, and the consistency of Bayes
estimates. His asymptotic theory for the bootstrap was also highly influential.
David was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991, and in
2003 he received the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science from
the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. In addition to his purely academic
research, David has extensive experience as a consultant, including working for
the Carnegie Commission, the City of San Francisco, and the Federal Reserve, as
well as several Departments of the U.S. Government--Energy, Treasury, Justice,
and Commerce. He has testified as an expert witness on statistics in a number
of law cases, including Piva v. Xerox (employment discrimination), Garza v.
County of Los Angeles (voting rights), and New York v. Department of Commerce
(census adjustment). Lastly, he is an exceptionally good writer and teacher,
and his many books and review articles are arguably his most important
contribution to our subject.

rotational degrees of freedom are coupled by the Stokes equation. In addition,
there is a close coupling of convection and diffusion due to the
position-dependent mobility. These couplings render calculation of the mean
encounter time between cell surface receptors and ligands on the substrate very
difficult. Here we show for a two-dimensional model system how analytical
progress can be achieved by treating motion in the vertical direction by an
effective reaction term in the mean first passage time equation for the
rotational degree of freedom. The strength of this reaction term can either be
estimated from equilibrium considerations or used as a fit parameter. Our
analytical results are confirmed by computer simulations and allow to assess
the relative roles of convection and diffusion for different scaling regimes of
interest.

groundbreaking, influential throughout the world, and widely recognized through

Statistical Institute and President of the International Statistical Institute,
among other eminent positions, has been likewise outstanding. In recognition of
Jayanta's enormous impact, this volume is an effort to honor him by drawing
together contributions to the main areas in which he has worked and continues
to work. The papers naturally fall into five categories. First, sequential
estimation was Jayanta's starting point. Thus, beginning with that topic, there
are two papers, one classical by Hall and Ding leading to a variant on
p-values, and one Bayesian by Berger and Sun extending reference priors to
stopping time problems. Second, there are five papers in the general area of
prior specification. Much of Jayanta's earlier work involved group families as
does Sweeting's paper here for instance. There are also two papers dwelling on
the link between fuzzy sets and priors, by Meeden and by Delampady and Angers.
Equally daring is the work by Mukerjee with data dependent priors and the
pleasing confluence of several prior selection criteria found by Ghosh, Santra
and Kim. Jayanta himself studied a variety of prior selection criteria
including probability matching priors and reference priors.

and extinctions. Among other causes, urbanization is responsible for habitat
reduction, habitat fragmentation and massive road kills. In this context, it is
urgent to develop and assess appropriate conservation measures. Using yearly
censuses of migrating adults of two anuran species at one location in
Switzerland, we examined the impact of a road mitigation measure - permanent
under-road tunnels with guiding trenches - along a road separating wintering
forests from breeding wetlands. We observe that the adult migrating populations
do not exhibit any long-term trend but undergo a transient increase a few years
after the installation of the road mitigation measure. Using additional
datasets like climatic data and censuses obtained in a control area, we show
that the observed pattern of migrating populations cannot be explained by any
other data at our disposal. We then checked as a working hypothesis whether the
installation of under-road tunnels could explain the observed transient or not.
To this end, we use a simple population model and show that the road mitigation
measure together with competition for resources can successfully explain the
experimental observations. We conclude by discussing the requirements for
further assessment of this hypothesis as well as consequences for conservation
planners.

  Analysis","7 pages, 5 figures, MILCOM 2008",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network coding increases throughput and is robust against failures and
erasures. However, since it allows mixing of information within the network, a
single corrupted packet generated by a Byzantine attacker can easily
contaminate the information to multiple destinations.
  In this paper, we study the transmission overhead associated with three
different schemes for detecting Byzantine adversaries at a node using network
coding: end-to-end error correction, packet-based Byzantine detection scheme,
and generation-based Byzantine detection scheme. In end-to-end error
correction, it is known that we can correct up to the min-cut between the
source and destinations. However, if we use Byzantine detection schemes, we can
detect polluted data, drop them, and therefore, only transmit valid data. For
the dropped data, the destinations perform erasure correction, which is
computationally lighter than error correction. We show that, with enough
attackers present in the network, Byzantine detection schemes may improve the
throughput of the network since we choose to forward only reliable information.
When the probability of attack is high, a packet-based detection scheme is the
most bandwidth efficient; however, when the probability of attack is low, the
overhead involved with signing each packet becomes costly, and the
generation-based scheme may be preferred. Finally, we characterize the tradeoff
between generation size and overhead of detection in bits as the probability of
attack increases in the network.

showing that the coupling $c$ plays the role of pseudo-charge. Importantly, we
could not obtain the SAdS in the limits of $c\to 0$, which means that the GBAdS

changes linearly with optical depth we find that, in those regions where the
magnetic field is more inclined and the Evershed flow is strongest (penumbral
intraspines), the magnetic field can either increase or decrease with depth.
Allowing more degrees of freedom to the magnetic field stratification reveals
that the magnetic field initially decreases from \log\tau_5 = -3 until
\log\tau_5 \simeq -1.0, but increases again below that. The presence of strong
magnetic fields near the continuum is at odds with the existence of regions
void of magnetic fields at, or right below, the \tau_5=1 level in the penumbra.

fermion, we here calculate the transition rate from a state made of one free
electron and one trion to a similar electron-trion pair, through the time
evolution of such a pair induced by Coulomb interaction between elementary
fermions. To do it in a convenient way, we describe the trion as one electron
interacting with one exciton, and we use the tools we have developed in the new
composite-exciton many-body theory. The trion-electron scattering contains a
direct channel in which ``in'' and ``out'' trions are made with the same
fermions, and an exchange channel in which the ``in'' free electron becomes one
of the ``out'' trion components. As expected, momenta are conserved in these
two channels. The direct scattering is found to read as the bare Coulomb
potential between elementary particles multiplied by a form factor which
depends on the ``in'' and ``out'' trion relative motion indices $\eta$ and
$\eta'$, this factor reducing to $\delta_{\eta\eta'}$ in the zero momentum
transfer limit: In this direct channel, the trion at large distance reacts as
an elementary particle, its composite nature showing up for large momentum
transfer. On the contrary, the fact that the trion is not elementary does
affect the exchange channel for all momentum transfers. We thus conclude that a
3-component fermion behaves as an elementary fermion for direct processes in
the small momentum transfer limit only.

model are investigated applying a strong coupling diagram technique in which
the expansion in powers of the hopping constants is used. For small lattices
and high temperatures results are in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.
With the departure from half-filling $x$ the low-frequency magnetic
susceptibility becomes incommensurate and the incommensurability parameter
grows with $x$. The incommensurability, its dependence on frequency and on $x$
resemble experimental results in lanthanum cuprates. Also for finite $x$ sharp
maxima appear in the static charge susceptibility. The maxima are finite which
points to the absence of the long-range charge ordering (static stripes).
However, for $x\approx 0.12$ the maxima are located near the momenta
$(0,\pm\pi/2)$, $(\pm\pi/2,0)$. In this case an interaction of carriers with
tetragonal distortions can stabilize stripes with the wavelength of four
lattice spacings, as observed in the low-temperature tetragonal phase of
cuprates. As follows from the obtained results, the magnetic incommensurability
is not a consequence of the stripes.

cognitive radio (CR) network under spectrum sharing with an existing primary
radio network. In particular, the fading cognitive multiple-access channel
(C-MAC) is first studied, where multiple secondary users transmit to the
secondary base station (BS) under both individual transmit-power constraints
and a set of interference-power constraints each applied at one of the primary
receivers. This paper considers the long-term (LT) or the short-term (ST)
transmit-power constraint over the fading states at each secondary transmitter,
combined with the LT or ST interference-power constraint at each primary
receiver. In each case, the optimal power allocation scheme is derived for the
secondary users to achieve the ergodic sum capacity of the fading C-MAC, as
well as the conditions for the optimality of the dynamic
time-division-multiple-access (D-TDMA) scheme in the secondary network. The
fading cognitive broadcast channel (C-BC) that models the downlink transmission
in the secondary network is then studied under the LT/ST transmit-power
constraint at the secondary BS jointly with the LT/ST interference-power
constraint at each of the primary receivers. It is shown that D-TDMA is indeed
optimal for achieving the ergodic sum capacity of the fading C-BC for all

most important divergence measure of information theory, Kullback divergence.
As opposed to Kullback divergence it determines in a very direct way a metric;
indeed, it is the square of a metric. We consider a family of divergence
measures (JD_alpha for alpha>0), the Jensen divergences of order alpha, which
generalize JD as JD_1=JD. Using a result of Schoenberg, we prove that JD_alpha
is the square of a metric for alpha lies in the interval (0,2], and that the
resulting metric space of probability distributions can be isometrically
embedded in a real Hilbert space. Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (QJD) is a
symmetrized and smoothed version of quantum relative entropy and can be
extended to a family of quantum Jensen divergences of order alpha (QJD_alpha).
We strengthen results by Lamberti et al. by proving that for qubits and pure
states, QJD_alpha^1/2 is a metric space which can be isometrically embedded in
a real Hilbert space when alpha lies in the interval (0,2]. In analogy with
Burbea and Rao's generalization of JD, we also define general QJD by
associating a Jensen-type quantity to any weighted family of states.
Appropriate interpretations of quantities introduced are discussed and bounds
are derived in terms of the total variation and trace distance.

Prominent Halpha emission is detected in half of the objects, most of which
show broad Halpha wings (up to ~4000 km/s). In the majority of the
Halpha-emission sources, fast, post-AGB winds are revealed by P-Cygni profiles.
In ~37% of the objects Halpha is observed in absorption. In almost all cases,
the absorption profile is partially filled with emission, leading to complex,
structured profiles that are interpreted as an indication of incipient post-AGB
mass-loss. All sources in which Halpha is seen mainly in absorption have F-G
type central stars, whereas sources with intense Halpha emission span a larger
range of spectral types from O to G. Shocks may be an important excitation
agent of the close stellar surroundings for objects with late type central
stars. Sources with pure emission or P Cygni Halpha profiles have larger J-K
color excess than objects with Halpha mainly in absorption, which suggests the
presence of warm dust near the star in the former. The two classes of profile
sources also segregate in the IRAS color-color diagram in a way that intense
Halpha-emitters have dust grains with a larger range of temperatures.

lines to electrons, we can meaningfully ask about an electron's instantaneous
speed relative to a given inertial frame. Interestingly, according to the
relativistic version of Bohmian mechanics using the Dirac equation, a massive
particle's speed is less than or equal to the speed of light, but not
necessarily less. That is, there are situations in which the particle actually
reaches the speed of light---a very non-classical behavior. That leads us to
the question of whether such situations can be arranged experimentally. We
prove a theorem, Theorem 5, implying that for generic initial wave functions
the probability that the particle ever reaches the speed of light, even if at
only one point in time, is zero. We conclude that the answer to the question is
no. Since a trajectory reaches the speed of light whenever the quantum
probability current psi-bar gamma^mu psi is a lightlike 4-vector, our analysis
concerns the current vector field of a generic wave function and may thus be of
interest also independently of Bohmian mechanics. The fact that the current is
never spacelike has been used to argue against the possibility of
faster-than-light tunnelling through a barrier, a somewhat similar question.
Theorem 5, as well as a more general version provided by Theorem 6, are also
interesting in their own right. They concern a certain property of a function
psi: R^4 --> C^4 that is crucial to the question of reaching the speed of
light, namely being transverse to a certain submanifold of C^4 along a given
compact subset of space-time. While it follows from the known transversality
theorem of differential topology that this property is generic among smooth
functions psi: R^4 --> C^4, Theorem 5 asserts that it is also generic among
smooth solutions of the Dirac equation.

spinors. We present numerical results in which the electrodes are treated both
as one-dimensional tight-binding wires and in the wide-band limit
approximation. In the latter case we derive a transparent analytic formula for

For any given strength of the spin-flip coupling the TMR becomes negative

which percolation (infection of the entire graph) becomes likely to occur. This
bootstrap process has been extensively studied on the $d$-dimensional grid
$[n]^d$: with $2\leq r\leq d$ fixed, it was proved by Cerf and Cirillo (for
$d=r=3$), and by Cerf and Manzo (in general), that
\[p_c([n]^d,r)=\Theta\biggl(\frac{1}{\log_{(r-1)}n}\biggr)^{d-r+1},\] where
$\log_{(r)}$ is an $r$-times iterated logarithm. However, the exact threshold
function is only known in the case $d=r=2$, where it was shown by Holroyd to be
$(1+o(1))\frac{\pi^2}{18\log n}$. In this paper we shall determine the exact
threshold in the crucial case $d=r=3$, and lay the groundwork for solving the
problem for all fixed $d$ and $r$.

Controlling the mechanical stability of DNA nanowires in charge transport
experiments is a requisite for identifying intrinsic issues responsible for
long range charge transfers. By merging density-functional-theory-based
calculations and model-Hamiltonian approaches, we have studied DNA quantum
transport during the stretching-twisting process of poly(GC) DNA oligomers.
During the stretching process, local maxima in the charge transfer integral t
between two nearest-neighbor GC pairs arise from the competition between
stretching and twisting. This is reflected in local maxima for the conductance,
which depend very sensitively on the coupling to the electrodes. In the case of
DNA-electrode couplings smaller than t, the conductance versus stretching
distance saturates to plateau in agreement with recent experimental
observations.

provides both thermal and quantum fluctuations of the voltage. Additional
decoherence sources are quasiparticle tunneling across the Josephson junctions

The analysis is based on a real-time diagrammatic technique which includes
Zeno-like effects in the charge transport, where the tunneling is slowed down
due to strong decoherence. As compared to the Pauli-master-equation treatment

equilibria is of fundamental importance for understanding the phenomenology of
accretion disks (AD) around compact objects (black holes, neutron stars, etc.).
The very existence of these equilibria is actually suggested by observations,
which show evidence of quiescent, and essentially non-relativistic, AD plasmas
close to compact stars, thus indicating that accretion disks may be
characterized by slowly varying EM and fluid fields. These (EM) fields, in
particular the electric field, may locally be extremely intense, so that AD
plasmas are likely to be locally non-neutral and therefore characterized by the
presence of Hall currents. This suggests therefore that such equilibria should
be described in the framework of the Hall-MHD theory. Extending previous
approaches, holding for non-rotating plasmas or based on specialized
single-species model equilibria which ignore the effect of space-time
curvature, the purpose of this work is the formulation of a generalized
Grad-Shafranov (GGS) equation suitable for the investigation of G-Hall-MHD
equilibria in AD's where non-relativistic plasmas are present. For this purpose
the equilibria are assumed to be generated by a strong axisymmetric stellar
magnetic field and by the gravitating plasma characterizing the AD.

realizable phase-space statistical descriptions able to reproduce in some
suitable sense the stochastic fluid equations of a turbulent fluid. In
particular, a major open issue is whether a purely Markovian statistical
description of hydrodynamic turbulence actually can be achieved. Based on the
formulation of a \textit{deterministic inverse kinetic theory} (IKT) for the 3D
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, here we claim that such a
\textit{Markovian statistical description actually exists}. The approach, which
involves the introduction of the \textit{local velocity probability density}
for the fluid (local pdf) - rather than the velocity-difference pdf adopted in
customary approaches to homogeneous turbulence - relies exclusively on first
principles. These include - in particular - the exact validity of the
stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, the principle of entropy maximization and a
constant H-theorem for the Shannon statistical entropy. As a result, the new
approach affords an exact equivalence between Lagrangian and Eulerian
formulations which permit local pdf's which are generally non-Maxwellian (i.e.,
non-Gaussian). The theory developed is quite general and applies in principle
even to turbulence regimes which are non-stationary and non-uniform in a
statistical sense.

general fields. In this work we affirmatively answer their conjecture. Using
this result we obtain a general worst case to average case reductions for

stars that exceed the Eddington limit and compare these against predictions
from earlier analytical solutions. Our models are based on the assumption that
the stellar atmosphere consists of clumped matter, where the individual clumps
have a much larger optical thickness than the matter between the clumps. This
`porosity' of the stellar atmosphere reduces the coupling between radiation and
matter, since photons tend to escape through the more tenuous gas between the
clumps. This allows a star that formally exceeds the Eddington limit to remain
stable, yet produce a steady outflow from the region where the clumps become
optically thin. We have made a parameter study of wind models for a variety of
input conditions in order to explore the properties of continuum-driven winds.
  The results show that the numerical simulations reproduce quite closely the
analytical scalings. The mass loss rates produced in our models are much larger
than can be achieved by line driving. This makes continuum driving a good
mechanism to explain the large mass loss and flow speeds of giant outbursts, as
observed in eta Carinae and other luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. Continuum
driving may also be important in population III stars, since line driving
becomes ineffective at low metalicities. We also explore the effect of photon
tiring and the limits it places on the wind parameters.

cosmological context by including a physical model for AGN feeding and feedback
in a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This is based on galaxy
interactions as triggers for AGN accretion, and on expanding blast waves as a
mechanism to propagate outwards the AGN energy injected into the interstellar
medium at the center of galaxies. We first test our model against the observed
number density of AGNs with different intrinsic luminosity as a function of
redshift. The model yields a ''downsizing'' behavior in close agreement with
the observed one for z<2. At higher redshifts, the model predicts an overall
abundance of AGNs (including Compton-thick sources) larger than the observed
Compton-thin sources by a factor around 2 for z>2 and L_X < 10^{44} erg/s.
Thus, we expect that at such luminosities and redshifts about 1/2 of the total
AGN population is contributed by Compton-thick sources. We then investigate the
dependence of the absorbing column density N_H associated to cold galactic gas
(and responsible for the Compton-thin component of the overall obscuration) on
the AGN luminosity and redshift. We find that the absorbed fraction of AGNs
with N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2} decreases with luminosity for z<1; in addition, the
total (integrated over luminosity) absorbed fraction increases with redshift up
to z around 2, and saturates to the value around 0.8 at higher redshifts.
Finally, we predict the luminosity dependence of the absorbed fraction of AGNs
with L_X< 3 10^{44} erg/s to weaken with increasing redshift. We compare our
results with recent observations, and discuss their implications in the context
of cosmological models of galaxy formation.

cooling along filaments, along the borders of the radio cavities. Molecular gas
is known to exist in clusters with cooling cores, in long and thin filaments
