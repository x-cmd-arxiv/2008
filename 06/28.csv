to six hydrogen atoms. The equality of all six CC bond lengths, despite the
alternating double and single bonds, and the surplus (resonance) energy, led to
the suggestion of two resonanting structures. Here, the new atomic structure
shows that the bond length equality is due to three carbon atoms with double
bond radii bound to three other carbon atoms with resonance bond radii (as in
graphene). Consequently, there are two kinds of CH bonds of slightly different
lengths. The bond energies account for the resonance energy.

find that the cluster early-type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars
approximately 0.5 Gyr earlier than early-types in the field, whereas field
early-types presumably finish forming their stellar content on a longer time
scale. Such a difference is particularly evident at lower masses but becomes
negligible for the most massive galaxies. While our differential analysis of
the stellar population parameters of cluster and field galaxies in the same
mass range convincingly shows distinct star formation histories, the absolute
age difference remains model dependent. Using the star formation histories that
best fit the SEDs of the red sequence galaxies in RDCS 1252.9-2927, we
reconstruct the evolution of the cluster red sequence and find that it was
established over 1 Gyr and is expected to dissolve by z ~ 2.

and interior half-angle $\alpha$ by a non-homogeneous random walk on the square
lattice with mean drift at $x$ of magnitude $O(1/|x|)$ as $|x| \to \infty$.
This is the critical regime for the asymptotic behaviour: under mild
conditions, a previous result of the authors (see arXiv:0910.1772) stated that
$\tau_\alpha < \infty$ a.s. for any $\alpha$ (while for a stronger drift field
$\tau_\alpha$ is infinite with positive probability). Here we study the more
difficult problem of the existence and non-existence of moments
$E[\tau_\alpha^s]$, $s>0$. Assuming (in common with much of the literature) a
uniform bound on the walk's increments, we show that for $\alpha < \pi/2$ there
exists $s_0 \in (0,\infty)$ such that $E[\tau_\alpha^s]$ is finite for $s <
s_0$ but infinite for $s > s_0$; under specific assumptions on the drift field
we show that we can attain $E[\tau_\alpha^s] = \infty$ for any $s > 1/2$. We
show that for $\alpha \leq \pi$ there is a phase transition between drifts of
magnitude $O(1/|x|)$ (the critical regime) and $o(1/|x|)$ (the subcritical
regime). In the subcritical regime we obtain a non-homogeneous random walk
analogue of a theorem for Brownian motion due to Spitzer, under considerably
weaker conditions than those previously given (including work by Varopoulos)

mismatch that is removed by elastic relaxation. The elastic strains are then no
longer compatible in the sense of the Saint-Venant law and the ensuing
incompatibility tensor is shown to be proportional to the gradients of the Nye
dislocation density tensor. We demonstrate that the presence of this

stress fields. Competition amongst the local and long-range interactions
results in frustration in the evolving order parameter (elastic) texture. We

a Fokker-Planck dynamics for the dislocation density. This approach represents
a self-consistent scheme that yields the evolutions of both the order parameter

simulations of the evolution of the interaction between the cocoon produced by
the jet with a dense cloud, placed very near the cocoon's path. We vary only
the jet's input power between P_{jet} = 10^{41}-10^{47} {\rm erg/sec}. The
density Probability Distribution Function (PDF) within the cocoon can be
described in terms of two distinct components, which are also spatially
distinct: a low- and a high-density component. The PDF of the post-shocked
region is well approximated by a modified lognormal distribution, for all
values of $P_{jet}$. During the active phase, when the jet is fed by the AGN,
the cloud is subject both to compression and stripping, which tend to increase
its density and diminish its total mass. When the jet is switched off (i.e.
during the passive phase) the shocked cloud cools further and tends to become
more filamentary, under the action of a back-flow which develops within the
cocoon. We study the evolution of the star formation rate within the cloud,
assuming that is determined by a Schmidt-Kennicutt law, and we analyze the
different physical factors which have an impact on the star formation rate. We
show that, although the star formation rate can occasionally increase, on time
scales of the order of $10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs, star formation will be inhibited
and the cloud fragments. The cooling time of the environment within which the
cloud is embedded is however very long: thus, star formation from the
fragmented cloud remains strongly inhibited.

Stars. Our understanding of the mechanisms through which they eject the
envelope and our assessment of their contribution to the chemical evolution of
Galaxies are hampered by poor knowledge of their Luminosities and mass loss
rates,both for C-rich and for O-rich sources.We plan to establish criteria
permitting a more quantitative determination of luminosities for the various
types of AGB stars on the basis of IR fluxes.In this paper we concentrate on
O-rich and s-element-rich MS, S stars and include a small sample of SC stars.We
reanalyze the absolute bolometric magnitudes and colors of MS, S, SC stars on
the basis of a sample of intrinsic and extrinsic long period variables.We
derive bolometric corrections as a function of near- and mid-IR colors,adopting
as references a group of stars for which the SED could be reconstructed in
detail over a large wavelength range.We determine the absolute HR diagrams and
compare luminosities and colors of S-type giants with those of C-rich AGB
stars. Luminosity estimates are also verified on the basis of existing
Period-Luminosity relations valid for O-rich Miras.S star bolometric
luminosities are almost indistinguishable from those of C-rich AGB stars.Their
circumstellar envelopes are thinner and less opaque.Despite this last property
the IR wavelengths remain dominant, with the bluest stars having their maximum
emission in the H or K bands.Based on Period-Luminosity relations for O-rich
Miras and on Magnitude-color relations for the same variables we show how
approximate distances for sources of so far unknown parallax can be inferred.
We argue that most of the sources have a rather small mass(<2Msun);dredge-up
might then be not effective enough to let the C/O ratio exceed unity.

8-9 band photometry in the rest-frame NUV, optical and IR, thus sampling the
entire relevant domain of emission of the different stellar populations.
Additionally, we present new, deep $U$-band photometry of both fields, giving
access to the critical FUV rest-frame, in order to constrain empirically the
dependence on the environment of the most recent star formation processes. We
find that early-type galaxies, both in the cluster and in the field, show
analogous optical morphologies, follow comparable mass vs. size relation, have
congruent average surface stellar mass densities and lie on the same Kormendy
relation. We also that a fraction of early-type galaxies in the field employ
longer timescales, $\tau$, to assemble their mass than their cluster
contemporaries. Hence we conclude that, while the formation epoch of early-type
only depends on their mass, the environment does regulate the timescales of
their star formation histories. Our deep $U$-band imaging strongly supports
this conclusions. It shows that cluster galaxies are at least 0.5 mag fainter
than their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical-to-infrared colors,
implying that the last episode of star formation must have happened more

heavily obscured AGN missed in even the deepest X-ray surveys. Using a 24
micron-selected sample in GOODS-S, we test the reliability and completeness of
three infrared AGN selection methods: (1) IRAC color-color selection, (2) IRAC
power-law selection, and (3) IR-excess selection; we also evaluate a number of
infrared excess approaches. We find that the vast majority of non-power-law
IRAC color-selected AGN candidates in GOODS-S have colors consistent with those
of star-forming galaxies. Contamination by star-forming galaxies is most
prevalent at low 24 micron flux densities (~100 uJy) and high redshifts (z~2),
but the fraction of potential contaminants is still high (~50%) at 500 uJy, the
highest flux density probed reliably by our survey. AGN candidates selected via
a simple, physically-motivated power-law criterion (PLGs), however, appear to
be reliable. We confirm that the infrared excess methods successfully identify
a number of AGN, but we also find that such samples may be significantly
contaminated by star-forming galaxies. Adding only the secure Spitzer-selected
PLG, color-selected, IR-excess, and radio/IR-selected AGN candidates to the
deepest X-ray-selected AGN samples directly increases the number of known X-ray
AGN (84) by 54-77%, and implies an increase to the number of 24 micron-detected
AGN of 71-94%. Finally, we show that the fraction of MIR sources dominated by
an AGN decreases with decreasing MIR flux density, but only down to f_24 = 300
uJy. Below this limit, the AGN fraction levels out, indicating that a
non-negligible fraction (~10%) of faint 24 micron sources (the majority of
which are missed in the X-ray) are powered not by star formation, but by the
central engine.

molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar PSS J2322+1944
(z=4.12). These observations confirm that the molecular gas (CO) in the host
galaxy of this quasar is lensed into a full Einstein ring, and reveal the
internal dynamics of the molecular gas in this system. The ring has a diameter
of ~1.5"", and thus is sampled over ~20 resolution elements by our observations.
Through a model-based lens inversion, we recover the velocity gradient of the
molecular reservoir in the quasar host galaxy of PSS J2322+1944. The Einstein
ring lens configuration enables us to zoom in on the emission and to resolve
scales down to ~1 kpc. From the model-reconstructed source, we find that the
molecular gas is distributed on a scale of 5 kpc, and has a total mass of
M(H2)=1.7 x 10^10 M_sun. A basic estimate of the dynamical mass gives M_dyn =
4.4 x 10^10 (sin i)^-2 M_sun, that is, only ~2.5 times the molecular gas mass,
and ~30 times the black hole mass (assuming that the dynamical structure is
highly inclined). The lens configuration also allows us to tie the optical
emission to the molecular gas emission, which suggests that the active galactic
nucleus (AGN) does reside within, but not close to the center of the molecular
reservoir. Together with the (at least partially) disturbed structure of the
CO, this suggests that the system is interacting. Such an interaction, possibly
caused by a major `wet' merger, may be responsible for both feeding the quasar
and fueling the massive starburst of 680 M_sun/yr in this system, in agreement
with recently suggested scenarios of quasar activity and galaxy assembly in the
early universe.

provide a better proxy to mass than the blue luminosities commonly used in the

uncertain distances. Accurate abundances are derived to assess the galaxy
metallicity. Optical spectra are collected for Hii regions in the dIrrs,
allowing the determination of oxygen abundances by means of the
temperature-sensitive method. For each dIrr galaxy H-band imaging is performed
and the total magnitudes are measured via surface photometry. This high-quality
database allows us to build a well-defined luminosity-metallicity relation in
the range -13 >= M(H) >= -20. The scatter around its linear fit is reduced to
0.11 dex, the lowest of all relations currently available. There might exist a
difference between the relation for dIrrs and the relation for giant galaxies,
although a firm conclusion should await direct abundance determinations for a
significant sample of massive galaxies. This new dataset provides an improved
luminosity-metallicity relation, based on a standard NIR band, for dwarf
star-forming galaxies. The relation can now be compared with some confidence to
the predictions of models of galaxy evolution. Exciting follow-ups of this work
are (a) exploring groups with higher densities, (b) exploring nearby galaxy
clusters to probe environmental effects on the luminosity-metallicity relation,
and (c) deriving direct oxygen abundances in the central regions of
star-forming giant galaxies, to settle the question of a possible dichotomy
between the chemical evolution of dwarfs and that of massive galaxies.

on the relative orientation of their spin states. We present a theory of
spin-dependent scattering in the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of field
effect transistors. Our theory shows that the scattering mechanism is dominated
by virtual transitions to negatively ionized donor levels. This effect
translates into a source-drain current that always gets reduced when donor
spins are at resonance with a strong microwave field. We propose a model for
donor impurities interacting with conduction electrons in a silicon transistor,
and compare our explicit numerical calculations to electrically detected
magnetic resonance (EDMR) experiments. Remarkably, we show that EDMR is optimal
for donors placed into a sweet spot located at a narrow depth window quite far
from the 2DEG interface. This allows significant optimization of spin signal
intensity for the minimal number of donors placed into the sweet spot, enabling
the development of single spin readout devices. Our theory reveals an
interesting dependence on conduction electron spin polarization p_c. As p_c
increases upon spin injection, the EDMR amplitude first increases as p_{c}^{2},
and then saturates when a polarization threshold p_T is reached. These results
show that it is possible to use EDMR as an in-situ probe of carrier spin
polarization in silicon and other materials with weak spin-orbit coupling.

the narrow OVI component of ~200 kms-1 from ~2"" southwest of the nucleus to ~4""
northeast. A similar pattern is also observed with the broad OVI component,
with a gradient of ~3000 kms-1. These are consistent with the HST/STIS findings

outflow; (3) A major portion of the CIII and NIII line flux is produced in the

for deciding on the significance of such correlations by characterizing the
influence of one neuron on another in terms of conditional probabilities and
specifying our null hypothesis in terms of a bound on the conditional
probabilities. This method of testing significance of correlation counts is
more general than the currently available methods since under our null
hypothesis we do not assume that the spiking processes of different neurons are
independent. The structure of our null hypothesis also allows us to rank order
the detected patterns in terms of the strength of interaction among the neurons

magnetoplasmas, occurring typically in the vicinity of massive stellar objects
(black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, etc.), is the accurate
description of single-particle covariant dynamics, based on gyrokinetic theory
(Beklemishev et al.,1999-2005). Provided radiation-reaction effects are
negligible, this is usually based on the assumption that both the space-time
metric and the EM fields (in particular the magnetic field) are suitably
prescribed and are considered independent of single-particle dynamics, while
allowing for the possible presence of gravitational/EM perturbations driven by
plasma collective interactions which may naturally arise in such systems. The
purpose of this work is the formulation of a generalized gyrokinetic theory
based on the synchronous variational principle recently pointed out (Tessarotto
et al., 2007) which permits to satisfy exactly the physical realizability
condition for the four-velocity. The theory here developed includes the
treatment of nonlinear perturbations (gravitational and/or EM) characterized
locally, i.e., in the rest frame of a test particle, by short wavelength and
high frequency. Basic feature of the approach is to ensure the validity of the
theory both for large and vanishing parallel electric field. It is shown that
the correct treatment of EM perturbations occurring in the presence of an
intense background magnetic field generally implies the appearance of
appropriate four-velocity corrections, which are essential for the description
of single-particle gyrokinetic dynamics.

identified with the quantum probability density and velocity field. This
feature has suggested the construction of a phase-space hidden-variable
description based on a suitable inverse kinetic theory (IKT; Tessarotto et al.,
2007). The discovery of this approach has potentially important consequences
since it permits to identify the classical dynamical system which advances in
time the quantum fluid fields. This type of approach, however requires the
identification of additional fluid fields. These can be generally identified
with suitable directional fluid temperatures $T_{QM,i}$ (for $i=1,2,3$), to be
related to the expectation values of momentum fluctuations appearing in the
Heisenberg inequalities. Nevertheless the definition given previously for them
(Tessarotto et al., 2007) is non-unique. In this paper we intend to propose a
criterion, based on the validity of a constant H-theorem, which provides an

simulation to study the recombination of hydrogen on grain surfaces in a

the actual physical grain area and $\alpha$ is a function of the flux of atomic
hydrogen which is determined from our simulation. We carry out the simulation
for various astrophysically relevant accretion rates. For high accretion rates,
small grains tend to become partly saturated with $H$ and $H_2$ and the
subsequent accretion will be partly inhibited. For very low accretion rates,
the number of sites to be swept before a molecular hydrogen can form is too

obstacle in deciding the production rate of molecular hydrogen and other
molecules in the interstellar medium. We present a numerical study to compute
this time for molecular hydrogen for various cloud and grain parameters. We
also find the time dependence, particularly when a grain is freshly injected
into the system. Apart from the fact that the recombination times seem to be
functions of the grain parameters such as the activation barrier energy,
temperature etc, our result also shows the dependence on the number of sites in
the grain $S$ and the effective accretion rate per site $a_s$ of atomic
hydrogen. Simply put, the average time that a pair of atomic hydrogens will
take to produce one molecular hydrogen depends on how heavily the grain is
already populated by atomic and molecular hydrogens and how fast the hopping
and desorption times are. We show that if we write the average recombination
time as $T_r \sim S^\alpha/A_H$, where, $A_H$ is the hopping rate, then
$\alpha$ could be much greater than 1 for all astrophysically relevant
accretion rates. Thus the average formation rate of $H_2$ is also dependent on
the grain parameters, temperature and the accretion rate. We believe that our
result will affect the overall rate of the formation of complex molecules such
as methanol which require successive hydrogenation on the grain surfaces in the
interstellar medium.

total sparsification. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance
of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular
$L_1$-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of

  Our first result is a remnant inequality condition which implies that two
words $u$ and $v$ are not doubly-twisted conjugate. Further we show that if
$\psi$ is given and $\phi$, $u$, and $v$ are chosen at random, then the
probability that $u$ and $v$ are not doubly-twisted conjugate is 1. In the
particular case of singly-twisted conjugacy, this means that if $\phi$, $u$,
and $v$ are chosen at random, then $u$ and $v$ are not in the same
singly-twisted conjugacy class with probability 1.
  Our second result generalizes Kim's ""bounded solution length"". We give an
algorithm for deciding doubly-twisted conjugacy relations in the case where
$\phi$ and $\psi$ satisfy a similar remnant inequality. In the particular case
of singly-twisted conjugacy, our algorithm suffices to decide any twisted
conjugacy relation if $\phi$ has remnant words of length at least 2.
  As a consequence of our generic properties we give an elementary proof of a
recent result of Martino, Turner, and Ventura, that computes the densities of
injective and surjective homomorphisms from one free group to another. We
further compute the expected value of the density of the image of a
homomorphism.

centrally peaked volume density distribution. We find no evidence for depletion

the theory with a normal quadratic kinetic term of arbitrary strength or the
first order theory with azimuthal symmetry (which is equivalently the so-called
easy-axis situation), that the tunneling is in fact suppressed for all non-zero

complex Euclidean action, it is necessary to use the ensuing complex critical
points in order to define the quantum (perturbation) theory \cite{ampr}. In the

conclusion, that the tunneling is unsuppressed for all spins, is reached.

proposed criterion can be applied to general networks whereby the contending

  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to
greatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF while ensuring fairness
levels among the stations of the same order of the ones available with the
classical PF criterion. Put simply, each station is allocated a throughput that
depends on a suitable normalization of its packet rate, which, to some extent,
measures the frequency by which the station tries to gain access to the
channel. Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming
the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.
