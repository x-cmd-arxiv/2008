spiral galaxies by examining their structure and kinematics. Rather than
two-dimensional rotation curves, we observe complete velocity fields by placing
three adjacent and parallel FORS2 MXU slits on each object, yielding several
emission and absorption lines. The gas velocity fields are reconstructed and
decomposed into circular rotation and irregular motions using kinemetry. To
quantify irregularities in the gas kinematics, we define three parameters:
sigma_{PA} (standard deviation of the kinematic position angle), Delta phi (the
average misalignment between kinematic and photometric position angles) and
k_{3,5} (squared sum of the higher order Fourier terms). Using local,
undistorted galaxies from SINGS, these can be used to establish the regularity
of the gas velocity fields. Here we present the analysis of 22 distant galaxies
in the MS0451.6-0305 field with 11 members at z=0.54. In this sample we find
both field (4 out of 8) and cluster (3 out of 4) galaxies with velocity fields
that are both irregular and asymmetric. We show that these fractions are
underestimates of the actual number of galaxies with irregular velocity fields.
The values of the (ir)regularity parameters for cluster galaxies are not very
different from those of the field galaxies, implying that there are isolated
field galaxies that are as distorted as the cluster members. None of the
deviations in our small sample correlate with photometric/structural properties
like luminosity or disk scale length in a significant way.
  Our 3D-spectroscopic method successfully maps the velocity field of distant
galaxies, enabling the importance and efficiency of cluster specific
interactions to be assessed quantitatively.

three applications of this observation. Firstly, it allows us to explicitly
compute the index of the catenoid cousins and some other examples. Secondly, it
allows us to be able to apply a method similar to that of Choe (using Killing
vector fields on minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space) to our case as well,
resulting in lower bounds of index for other examples. And thirdly, it allows
us to give a more direct proof of the result by do Carmo and Silveira that if a
constant mean curvature 1 surface in hyperbolic 3-space has finite total
curvature, then it has finite index. Finally, we show that for any constant
mean curvature 1 surface in hyperbolic 3-space that has been constructed via a
correspondence to a minimal surface in Euclidean 3-space, we can take advantage
of this correspondence to find a lower bound for its index.

the moment closure problem. Many types of closures have been presented in the
literature. In this note, we demonstrate that optimal prediction, an approach
originally developed to approximate the mean solution of systems of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations, can be used to derive moment closures. To that
end, the formalism is generalized to systems of partial differential equations.
Using Gaussian measures, existing linear closures can be re-derived, such as
$P_N$, diffusion, and diffusion correction closures. This provides a new
perspective on several approximations done in the process and gives rise to
ideas for modifications to existing closures.

electron and spin transport through ferromagnetic mesoscopic junctions
including two or more barriers. Such systems are also called ferromagnetic
single-electron transistors. We start from the situation when the central part
of a device has the form of a magnetic (or nonmagnetic) metallic nanoparticle.
Transport characteristics reveal then single-electron charging effects,
including the Coulomb staircase, Coulomb blockade, and Coulomb oscillations.
Single-electron ferromagnetic transistors based on semiconductor quantum dots
and large molecules (especially carbon nanotubes) are also considered. The main
emphasis is placed on the spin effects due to spin-dependent tunnelling through
the barriers, which gives rise to spin accumulation and tunnel
magnetoresistance. Spin effects also occur in the current-voltage
characteristics, (differential) conductance, shot noise, and others. Transport
characteristics in the two limiting situations of weak and strong coupling are
of particular interest. In the former case we distinguish between the
sequential tunnelling and cotunneling regimes. In the strong coupling regime we
concentrate on the Kondo phenomenon, which in the case of transport through
quantum dots or molecules leads to an enhanced conductance and to a pronounced
zero-bias Kondo peak in the differential conductance.

filaments strong in Halpha emission in cooling flow clusters occur only if the
minimum specific entropy and the radiative cooling time of the intracluster
medium (ICM), are below a specific threshold. The explanation is based on the
cold feedback mechanism. In this mechanism the mass accreted by the central
black hole originates in non-linear over-dense blobs of gas residing in an
extended region of the cooling flow region. I use the criterion that the
feedback cycle period must be longer than the radiative cooling time of dense
blobs for large quantities of gas to cool to low temperature. The falling time
of the dense blobs is parameterized by the ratio of the infall velocity to the
sound speed. Another parameter is the ratio of the blobs' density to that of
the surrounding ICM. By taking the values of the parameters as in previous
papers on the cold feedback model, I derive an expression that gives the right
value of the entropy threshold. Future studies will have to examine in more
detail the role of these parameters, and to show that the observed sharp change
in the behavior of clusters across the entropy, or radiative cooling time,
threshold can be reproduced by the model.

partially connected IC comes from the fact that not all interferences are
equally strong in practice. The MUXG is characterized as a function of the
number ($K$) of users and the number ($N \geq 1$) of interfering links. Our
analysis is mainly based on the interference alignment (IA) technique to
mitigate interference. Our main results are as follows: One may expect that
higher MUXG can be attained when some of interfering links do not exist.
However, when $N$ is odd and $K=N+2$, the MUXG is not increased beyond the
optimal MUXG of fully connected IC, which is $\frac{KM}{2}$. The number of
interfering links has no influence on the achievable MUXG using IA, but affects
the efficiency in terms of the number of required channel realizations: When
N=1 or 2, the optimal MUXG of the fully connected IC is achievable with a
finite number of channel realizations. In case of $N \geq 3$, however, the MUXG
of $\frac{KM}{2}$ can be achieved asymptotically as the number of channel
realizations tends to infinity.

suggest that glitches result from scale-invariant avalanches

(SOCS). A cellular automaton provides a computationally efficient means of
modelling the collective behaviour of up to $10^{16}$ vortices in the pulsar
interior, whilst ensuring that the dominant aspects of the microphysics are not
lost. The automaton generates avalanche distributions that are qualitatively
consistent with a SOCS and with glitch data. The probability density functions
of glitch sizes and durations are power laws, and the probability density
function of waiting times between successive glitches is Poissonian, consistent
with statistically independent events. The output of the model depends on the
physical and computational paramters used. The fitted power law exponents for
the glitch sizes ($a$) and durations ($b$) decreases as the strength of the
vortex pinning increases. Similarly the exponents increase as the fraction of
vortices that are pinned decreases. For the physical and computational
parameters considered, one finds $-4.3\leq a \leq -2.0$ and $-5.5\leq b\leq

very difficult to produce significant amounts of the molecular species.
Instead, the grain is found to be full of atomic species. The production rates

in primitive references. In this article we describe an approach, called
concept-oriented programming (COP), which focuses on modelling references
assuming that they also possess application-specific structure and behaviour
accounting for a great deal or even most of the overall program complexity.
References in COP are completely legalized and get the same status as objects
while the functions are distributed among both objects and references. In order
to support this design we introduce a new programming construct, called
concept, which generalizes conventional classes and concept inclusion relation
generalizing class inheritance. The main advantage of COP is that it allows
programmers to describe two sides of any program: explicitly used functions of
objects and intermediate functionality of references having cross-cutting
nature and executed implicitly behind the scenes during object access.

with the extended Hubbard model in the limit of strong Coulomb repulsion,
low-energy configurations can be mapped onto hard-core dimer configurations
whose dimers carry a spin degree of freedom. An effective Hamiltonian similar
to the kinetic term of a quantum dimer model on the square lattice which
rotates two parallel dimers (in a spin-singlet configuration) by 90 degrees
naturally emerges. We also introduce an additional term in the Hamiltonian, a
generalized dimer plaquette interaction, in order to realize a closer analogy
to the latter model. For a strong dimer plaquette attraction stabilizing a
columnar phase, a spontaneous dimerization takes place in the direction of the
columns of (spin-carrying) dimers. Using exact diagonalizations of
two-dimensional periodic clusters, the analysis of the low-energy spectrum and
of several types of correlation functions gives indeed evidence for a new type
of lattice symmetry breaking phase, the eight-fold degenerate Mixed
Columnar-Plaquette Crystal, and for a transition from this phase to a
