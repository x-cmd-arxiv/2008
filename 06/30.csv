ICDE'09",,,,"cs.DB cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the SPARQL query language for RDF has reached the W3C
recommendation status. In response to this emerging standard, the database
community is currently exploring efficient storage techniques for RDF data and
evaluation strategies for SPARQL queries. A meaningful analysis and comparison
of these approaches necessitates a comprehensive and universal benchmark
platform. To this end, we have developed SP^2Bench, a publicly available,
language-specific SPARQL performance benchmark. SP^2Bench is settled in the
DBLP scenario and comprises both a data generator for creating arbitrarily
large DBLP-like documents and a set of carefully designed benchmark queries.
The generated documents mirror key characteristics and social-world
distributions encountered in the original DBLP data set, while the queries
implement meaningful requests on top of this data, covering a variety of SPARQL
operator constellations and RDF access patterns. As a proof of concept, we
apply SP^2Bench to existing engines and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
that follow immediately from the benchmark results.

  interactions with 2 Higgs doublets","20 pages",,,"PTA/07-058","hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  The interactions and even the number of the Higgs scalar fields are not fixed
in the SU(2)U(1) standard model of the electro-weak interactions and the
intrinsically chiral nature of the weak interactions is not explained.
Embedding SU(2)U(1) into the Lie super-algebra SU(2/1) fills these gaps. The 2
smallest representations of SU(2/1) adequately describe the electron, neutrino,
up and down quarks and correlate their chiralities with their U(1) charges, and
the Higgs fields have the quantum numbers of the odd generators. But so far,
there was an apparent conflict with unitarity, because the quark representation
is not Hermitian and the super-Killing metric is not positive definite. We
solve this paradox by assuming the existence of 2 complex Higgs doublets
minimally coupled to the Fermions via the chiral projections of the odd
generators of SU(2/1). We find that Lagrangian induced by the Fermion loops is
unitary, thanks to the balance between the leptons and the quarks needed to
cancel the triangle anomaly and that the super-Jacobi identity guarantees that
the photon remains massless after symmetry breaking. In addition, the
Lagrangian has a classical geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature
of the corresponding Hermitian algebra. Assuming that the relative strength of
the scalar and vector couplings does not depend on the number of families
constrains the mass of the Higgs to $M^2_{H^0_1} + M^2_{H^0_2} = 32/9 M^2_W = 2
(107.2 GeV)^2$. Contrary to grand-unified or Wess-Zumino super-symmetric
models, the SU(2/1) internal super-unification does not predict any unobserved
particle besides the 2 Higgs doublets.

maintained at high values in the $10^{-44}$cm$^{2}$ range for neutralino masses
up to $\sim 850$ GeV . It is also shown that the direct detection of dark
matter along with lepton plus jet signatures and missing energy provide dual,

Stino XWIMP), or milli-charged dark matter arising from the Stueckelberg

investigated: exact NLO results at low and moderate $Q^2\lesssim m^2$,
asymptotic NLO predictions at high $Q^2\gg m^2$, and both NLO and NNLO
soft-gluon (or threshold) corrections at large Bjorken $x$. Our analysis shows
that large radiative corrections to the structure functions $F_T(x,Q^2)$ and
$F_L(x,Q^2)$ cancel each other in their ratio $R(x,Q^2)$ with good accuracy. As
a result, the NLO contributions to the Callan-Gross ratio are less than 10% in
a wide region of the variables $x$ and $Q^2$. We provide compact LO predictions
for $R(x,Q^2)$ in the case of low $x\ll 1$. A simple formula connecting the
high-energy behavior of the Callan-Gross ratio and low-$x$ asymptotics of the

one needs an extension of the usual tensor calculus. Its key ingredients are

these ingredients for d=4 N=1 Poincar\'e supergravity, we discover the special
role played by R-symmetry (absent in the d=3 N=1 case we studied previously).
The $U(1)_A$ R-symmetry has to be gauged which leads us to extend the
old-minimal set of auxiliary fields S, P, A_\mu by a $U(1)_A$ compensator $a$.
Our results include the ``F+A'' density formula, the ``Q+L+A'' formula for the
induced supersymmetry transformations (closing into the standard d=3 N=1

the extrinsic curvature multiplet. We rely on the superconformal approach which

Tauri stars (CTTSs), within the context of both the X-wind model and other
theoretical scenarios, have assumed a dipolar geometry for the stellar magnetic
field if it were not perturbed by the presence of an accreting, electrically
conducting disk. However, CTTS surveys reveal that accretion hot spots cover a
small fraction of the stellar surface, and that the net field polarization on
the stellar surface is small. Both facts imply that the magnetic field
generated by the star has a complex non-dipolar structure. To address this
discrepancy between theory and observations, we re-examine X-wind theory
without the dipole constraint. Using simple physical arguments based on the
concept of trapped flux, we show that a dipole configuration is in fact not
essential. Independent of the precise geometry of the stellar magnetosphere,
the requirement for a certain level of trapped flux predicts a definite
relationship among various CTTS observables. Moreover, superposition of
multipole stellar fields naturally yield small observed hot-spot covering
fractions and small net surface polarizations. The generalized X-wind picture
remains viable under these conditions, with the outflow from a small annulus
near the inner disk edge little affected by the modified geometry, but with
inflow highly dependent on the details of how the emergent stellar flux is
linked and trapped by the inner disk regions. Our model is consistent with
data, including recent spectropolarimetric measurements of the hot spot sizes
and field strengths in V2129 Oph and BP Tau.

in nanoconfinement, we find that (i) the peak had been obtained by joining the
data for emulsified water with that of the nanoconfined water and (ii) only
three water molecules can be fitted across the 1.1 nm diameter pores used in
the study, two of which form a cylindrical shell that is hydrogen bonded to
silica. The remaining connectedness of one water molecule would not produce a
metal alloy-like lambda-transition, or cooperative motions. Therefore, there is
no basis for considering such an ordering in supercooled water.

We address the
question: What conditions on c ensure the existence of a 1-dimensional complex
subvariety V with boundary c in X. When X = C^n, an answer to this question
involves the polynomial hull of gamma. When X = P^n, complex projective space,
the projective hull hat{c} of c comes into play. One always has V contained in
hat{c}, and for analytic curves they conjecturally coincide.
  In this paper we establish an approximate analogue of this idea which holds
without the analyticity of c. We characterize points in hat{c} as those which
lie on a sequence of analytic disks whose boundaries converge down to c. This
is in the spirit of work of Poletsky and of Larusson-Sigurdsson, whose work is
essential here.
  The results are applied to construct a remarkable example of a closed curve c
in P^2, which is real analytic at all but one point, and for which the closure
of hat{c} is W \cup L where L is a projective line and W is an analytic
(non-algebraic) subvariety of P^2 - L. Furthermore, hat{c} itself is the union
of W with only two points on L.

AGNs. The SEDs of NOT BL AGNs are dominated by the galaxy emission in the
optical/near-infrared, and show a rise in the mid-infrared which suggests the

their kinematic and photometric properties. We find that (1) the estimated
luminous CSS population in the Virgo cluster core is half of that in Fornax,
possibly reflecting the more relaxed dynamical status of the latter; (2) in
both clusters the luminous CSS velocity dispersions are less than those of the
cD galaxy GC system or cluster dE galaxies, suggesting luminous CSSs have less
energetic orbits; (3) Fornax has a sub-population of cluster core luminous CSSs
that are redder and presumably more metal-rich than those found in Virgo; (4)
no luminous CSSs were found in a 10-20 arcmin (60-130 kpc) radial arc east of
the 3 Gyr old NGC 1316 galaxy merger remnant or in the adjacent intracluster
region, implying that any luminous CSSs created in the galaxy merger have not
been widely dispersed.

the hard state of GX 339--4. The broadband 3--200 keV spectra were successfully
modeled by a simple analytic model, power--law with an exponential cut-off
modified with a smeared edge. The obtained energy cut-off ($E_{\rm{cut}}$) was
distributed over 50--200 keV, and the photon index over 1.4--1.7. We found a
clear anti-correlation ($E_{\rm{cut}} \propto L^{-0.70\pm0.06}$) between the
X-ray luminosity ($L$) in 2--200 keV and $E_{\rm{cut}}$, when $L$ is larger
than $7 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 8 kpc), while
$E_{\rm{cut}}$ is roughly constant at around 200 keV when $L$ is smaller than
$7 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This anti-correlation remained unchanged by
adopting a more physical thermal Comptonization model, which resulted in the
anti-correlation that can be expressed as $kT_{\rm{e}} \propto
L^{-0.24\pm0.06}$. These anti-correlations can be quantitatively explained by a
picture in which the energy-flow rate from protons to electrons balances with
the inverse Compton cooling.

superconductivity occurs upon carrier doping to pristine compound which

that superconductivity appears in the vicinity of magnetic phase. Investigation
of electronic states near the boundary between these two phases might provide
some useful information on the mechanism of superconductivity, as it has been
proved to be the case in many exotic superconductors. Here we show by muon

superconducting and spin glass-like magnetic phases occurs at x=0.06 that is
near the phase boundary, where both the magnetism and superconductivity develop
simultaneously below a common Tc ~ 18 K. This accordance strongly suggests

determination of the fluid pressure in isothermal incompressible fluids. In
particular this concerns the construction of an exact evolution equation for
the fluid pressure which replaces the Poisson equation and yields an algorithm
which is a Poisson solver, i.e., it permits to time-advance exactly the same

incompressible Navier-Stokes equations represent a mixture of hyperbolic and
elliptic pde's, which are extremely hard to study both analytically and
numerically. In this paper we intend to show that an exact solution to this
problem can be achieved adopting the approach based on inverse kinetic theory
(IKT) recently developed for incompressible fluids by Ellero and Tessarotto

fields can be achieved by means of a suitable dynamical system, to be
identified with the so-called Navier-Stokes (N-S) dynamical system. As a
consequence it is found that the fluid pressure obeys a well-defined evolution
equation. The result appears relevant for the construction of Lagrangian

rely typically on appropriate \emph{kinetic models} for the fluid equations

by an undesirable computational complexity. In particular, a fundamental issue
is to estimate the algorithmic complexity of numerical simulations based on
traditional LBM's (Lattice-Boltzmann methods; for review see Succi, 2001

energy observations (17-100 keV) of five NLS1 galaxies (3 bona fide and 2

spectral analysis using data obtained by Swift/XRT below 10 keV. The combined
INTEGRAL spectrum is found to be steeper (Gamma=2.6 +/- 0.3) than those of
classical Seyfert 1 objects. This is due to a high energy cutoff, which is
required in some individual fits as in the average broad band spectrum. The
location of this high energy cutoff is at lower energies (E < 60 keV) than
typically seen in classical type 1 AGNs; a reflection component may also be
present but its value (R < 0.8) is compatible with those seen in standard
Seyfert 1s. We do not detect a soft excess in individual objects but only in
their cumulative spectrum. Our results suggest a lower plasma temperature for
the accreting plasma which combined to the high accretion rates (close to the
Eddington rate) point to different nuclear conditions in broad and narrow line
Seyfert 1 galaxies, likely related to different evolutionary stages.

minima and move through the array, causing a voltage across each junction. We
find that for the initial depinning, the fluxon behaves as a single particle
and follows a Kramers-type escape law. However, under some conditions this
single particle description breaks down. At low values of the discreteness
parameter and low values of the damping, the depinning rate is larger than the
single particle result would suggest. In addition, for some values of the
parameters the fluxon can undergo low-voltage diffusion before switching to the
high-voltage whirling mode. This type of diffusion is similar to phase
diffusion in a single junction, but occurs without frequency-dependent damping.
We study the switching to the whirling state as well.

defining the framework of models describing radio source evolution. We
investigate whether young radio sources are in equipartition (i.e. minimum
energy) conditions by comparing the equipartition magnetic fields of 5 High
Frequency Peakers (HFP) with values directly inferred from the spectral peak
assumed to be produced by synchrotron self absorption. Multi-frequency VLBA
observations of 5 HFPs were carried out in both the optically thick and thin
part of the spectrum to determine the spectral shape and angular size of the
components for which individual radio spectra were obtained. We find that the
magnetic fields measured using observations agree well with those obtained by
assuming equipartition, which implies that these sources are in minimum energy
condition and the turnover in their spectra is due probably to SSA. In two
source components, we found that the peak of the spectrum is caused by
absorption of a thermal plasma instead of being due to SSA. The magnetic fields
found in the various components range from 10 to 100 mG. In the presence of
such high magnetic fields, electron populations with rather low $\gamma$ emit
in the GHz-regime. In one source, we detect low-surface brightness extended
emission at low frequency located ~30 mas (~50 pc) from the main source. This
feature may be related to either an earlier episode of radio activity or a
discontinuous start of the radio activity (sputtering). By comparing our data
with previous VLBA observations, we estimate the hotspot advance speed to be in
the range 0.1-0.7c and kinematic ages of a few hundred years.

Fermi motion is essential for the two processes. While the average momentum
approximation can partly simulate the Fermi motion in the process, the ``frozen
nucleon'' assumption yields very different results, especially at lower
energies. The Coulomb effect induced by the interaction between the positively
charged kaon and the hypertriton is found to be negligible. The influence of
higher partial waves is also found to be relatively small, in contrast to the
finding of the previous work. The off-shell assumption is found to be very
sensitive in the case of electroproduction rather than in photoproduction. It
is shown that the few available experimental data favor the assumption that the
initial nucleon is off-shell and the final hyperon is on-shell. This seems to
be reasonable, since the hyperon in the hypertriton is less bound than the
nucleon in the initial 3He nucleus. The effect of the missing resonance

(SQIF) is investigated. The voltage to magnetic field response function, V(H),
is determined by a Fraunhofer dependence of the critical current and magnetic
flux focusing effect in Josephson junctions (F-mode). For SQIF-arrays made of
high-Tc superconducting bicrystal Josephson junctions the F-mode plays a
predominant role in the voltage-field response V(H). The relatively large
superconducting loops of the SQIF are used for inductive coupling to the
external input circuit. It is shown that the output noise of a SQIF-array
measured with a cooled amplifier in the 1-2 GHz range is determined by the
slope of the V(H) characteristic. Power gain and saturation power were
evaluated using low frequency SQIF parameters. Finally, we consider the
influence of the spread in the parameters of Josephson junctions in the
SQIF-array on the V(H) characteristic of the whole structure.

of reference (FR) as a set of states that can be used to express all other
states of the total system. The theory is based on four basic postulates, which
have, loosely speaking, the following contents. (i) A reference property of a
RS has a definite value and is sufficiently stable in the FR directly related
to the reference property. (ii) States of the total system are associated with
vectors in the Hilbert space. (iii) Schr\""odinger equation is the dynamical law
in each valid FR. (iv) Under certain condition a property of a system can be
regarded as a reference property; vector descriptions of the total system given
in different FRs of the same RS may have a probabilistic relationship like in

long-standing astronomical problem of de-projecting the bi-dimensional,
apparent morphology of a three-dimensional distribution of gas. We focus on the
quantification and spatial recovery of turbulent motions in planetary nebulae
(and other classes of expanding nebulae) by means of long-slit echellograms
over a wide spectral range. We introduce some basic theoretical notions,
discuss the observational methodology, and develop an accurate procedure
disentangling all broadening components of the velocity profile in all spatial
positions of each spectral image. This allows us to extract random, non-thermal
motions at unprecedented accuracy, and to map them in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensions.
We present the solution to practical problems in the multi-dimensional
turbulence-analysis of a testing-planetary nebula (NGC 7009), using the
three-step procedure (spatio-kinematics, tomography, and 3-D rendering)
developed at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua. In addition, we introduce
an observational paradigm valid for all spectroscopic parameters in all classes
of expanding nebulae. Unsteady, chaotic motions at a local scale constitute a
fundamental (although elusive) kinematical parameter of each planetary nebula,
providing deep insights on its different shaping agents and mechanisms, and on
their mutual interaction. The detailed study of turbulence, its stratification
within a target and (possible) systematic variation among different sub-classes
of planetary nebulae deserve long-slit, multi-position angle, wide-spectral
range echellograms containing emissions at low-, medium-, and high-ionization,
to be analyzed pixel-to-pixel with a straightforward and versatile methodology,

investigate the effect of doping on the destabilization of the monoclinic
structure relative to the layered rhombohedral structure. A primary motivation
of this work was to determine to what extent the predictions of the
electronically more realistic GGA+U treatment would differ from those obtained
within the GGA. Several significant qualitative changes are found. For the
pristine system in the rhombohedral structure, Mn ions show a high-spin state
within GGA+U, rather than the low spin (metallic) state found in GGA. The doped
rhombohedral structure is unstable within GGA+U, rather than metastable, as in
GGA. In the monoclinic structure, the dopant oxidation states are the same
(trivalent Fe, divalent Co, Ni) in GGA+U and GGA. Co and Ni ions show a higher
spin state in GGA+U than in GGA. The divalent dopants destabilized the
monoclinic structure to a greater extent than trivalent dopants within the
GGA+U, as expected from previous GGA calculations. Overall, our results suggest
that the relatively close agreement sometimes found between properties
calculated within the GGA and GGA+U may be misleading, because the underlying
electronic behaviors may be profoundly different.

foundations still remain unsolved to date. This concerns in particular the
search of possible exact kinetic equations and, specifically, the conjecture
proposed by Grad (Grad, 1972) and developed in a seminal work by Lanford
(Lanford, 1974) that kinetic equations - such as the Boltzmann equation for a
gas of classical hard spheres - might result exact in an appropriate asymptotic
limit, usually denoted as Boltzmann-Grad limit. The Lanford conjecture has
actually had a profound influence on the scientific community, giving rise to a
whole line of original research in kinetic theory and mathematical physics.
Nevertheless, several aspects of the theory remain to be addressed and
clarified. In fact, its validity has been proven for the Boltzmann equation
only at most in a weak sense, i.e., if the Boltzmann-Grad limit is defined
according to the weak * convergence. While it is doubtful whether the result
applies for arbitrary times and for general situations (and in particular more
generally for classical systems of particles interacting via binary forces), it
remains completely unsolved the issue whether the conjecture might be valid
also in a stronger sense (\textit{strong Lanford conjecture}). This paper will
point out a physical model providing a counter-example to the strong Lanford
conjecture, representing a straightforward generalization of the classical
model based on a gas of hard-smooth spheres. In particular we claim that that
the one-particle limit function, defined in the sense of the strong
Boltzmann-Grad limit, does not generally satisfy the BBGKY (or Boltzmann)
hierarchy. The result is important for the theoretical foundations of kinetic
theory.

rates in multi-terminal networks. Cooperation refers to the process of nodes
working together to relay data toward the destination. There is an inherent
tradeoff between achievable information transmission rates and the level of
cooperation, which is determined by how many nodes are involved and how the
nodes encode/decode the data. We illustrate this trade-off by studying
information-theoretic decode-forward based coding strategies for data
transmission in multi-terminal networks. Decode-forward strategies are usually
discussed in the context of omniscient coding, in which all nodes in the
network fully cooperate with each other, both in encoding and decoding. In this
paper, we investigate myopic coding, in which each node cooperates with only a
few neighboring nodes. We show that achievable rates of myopic decode-forward
can be as large as that of omniscient decode-forward in the low SNR regime. We
also show that when each node has only a few cooperating neighbors, adding one
node into the cooperation increases the transmission rate significantly.
Furthermore, we show that myopic decode-forward can achieve non-zero rates as
the network size grows without bound.

scanning observing modes rather than traditional position-switched (chopped)
modes. The choice of observing mode is critical for isolating source signals
from various types of noise interference, especially for ground-based
instrumentation operating under a bright atmosphere. Ideal observing strategies
can combat 1/f noise, resist instrumental defects, sensitively recover emission
on large scales, and provide an even field coverage -- all under feasible
requirements of telescope movement. This work aims to guide the design of
observing patterns that maximize scientific returns. It also compares some of
the popular choices of observing modes for (sub)millimeter imaging, such as
random, Lissajous, billiard, spiral, On-The-Fly (OTF), DREAM, chopped and stare
patterns. Many of the conclusions are also applicable other imaging
applications and imaging in one dimension (e.g. spectroscopic observations).

can be encoded nonlocally in a pair of spatially separated Majorana bound
states. Such Majorana qubits are in demand as building blocks of a topological
quantum computer, but direct experimental tests of the nonlocality remain
elusive. Here we propose a method to probe the nonlocality by means of crossed
Andreev reflection, which is the injection of an electron into one bound state
followed by the emission of a hole by the other bound state (equivalent to the
splitting of a Cooper pair over the two states). We have found that, at
sufficiently low excitation energies, this nonlocal scattering process
dominates over local Andreev reflection involving a single bound state. As a
consequence, the low-temperature and low-frequency fluctuations $\delta I_{i}$
of currents into the two bound states $i=1,2$ are maximally correlated:
$\overline{\delta I_{1}\delta I_{2}}=\overline{\delta I_{i}^{2}}$.

kinetic equations remains elusive to date. This concerns, specifically, the
issue of the validity of the conjecture proposed by Grad (Grad, 1972) and
developed in a seminal work by Lanford (Lanford, 1974) that kinetic equations -
such as the Boltzmann equation for a gas of classical hard spheres - might
result exact in an appropriate asymptotic limit, usually denoted as
Boltzmann-Grad limit. The Lanford conjecture has actually had a profound
influence on the scientific community, giving rise to a whole line of original
research in kinetic theory and mathematical physics. Nevertheless, certain
aspects of the theory remain to be addressed and clarified. The purpose of this
paper is to investigate the possible existence of the strong Boltzmann-Grad
limit for the BBGKY hierarchy. Contrary to previous approaches in which the
w*-convergence was considered for the definition of the Boltzmann-Grad limit
functions, based on their construction in terms of time-series expansions
obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy, here we look for the possible existence of
strong limit functions in the sense of local convergence in phase space. The
result is based on the adoption of the Klimontovich approach to statistical
mechanics, permitting the explicit representation of the $s$-body reduced
distribution functions in terms of the Klimontovich probability density.

acquire Berry phases; geometric phases given by the area enclosed by the

easier to observe than a conventional one, because it is not masked by either
the dynamic phase or the leading non-adiabatic phase. The effects that we

difference at the V band is estimated to be 7.2 mag. Continued HST observations
will significantly reduce the mass errors, which are presently still too large

plane. For low frequency vertical modes, the largest amplitude particle motion
is concentrated within a few inner rings with the outer rings remaining almost
motionless. Both of these are in direct contrast to the data obtained for the
horizontal modes where it is shown that at high frequencies the largest
amplitude particle motion is concentrated within the inner rings.

According to the zero-point energy the isotopomers having the hydrogen atom in
the bridging position are more stable by about 1 kJ/mol as compared to the
deuterium case. This holds irrespective of the deuteration state of the two OH

theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolations below the KbarN threshold, we
find that the antikaonic dibaryon ppK^- is NOT deeply bound. With the driving
s-wave KbarN interaction the resulting total binding energy is B(ppK^-) = 20

\Lambda(1405), as an I=0 quasi-bound state of Kbar and a nucleon, appears to
survive in the ppK^- cluster. Estimates are given for the influence of p-wave
KbarN interactions and for the width from two-nucleon absorption (KbarNN -> YN)

  1) the formulation of the kinetic treatment of G-Hall-MHD equilibria. Based
on the identification of the relevant first integrals of motion, we show that
an explicit representation can be given for the equilibrium kinetic
distribution function. For each species this is represented as a superposition
of suitable generalized Maxwellian distributions;
  2) the determination of the constraints to be placed on the fluid fields for
the existence of the kinetic equilibria. In particular, this permits a unique
determination of the functional form of the species number densities and of the
fluid partial pressures, in terms of suitably prescribed flux functions.

adopted is based on the so-called IKT approach (inverse kinetic theory),
developed by Ellero et al. (2004-2008) which permits an exact phase-space
description of incompressible fluids based on the adoption of a local pdf. We
intend to show that for prescribed models of stochasticity the present approach
permits to determine uniquely the time evolution of the stochastic fluid
fields. The stochastic-averaged local pdf is shown to obey a kinetic equation
which, although generally non-Markovian, locally in velocity-space can be
approximated by means of a suitable Fokker-planck kinetic equation. As a side
result, the same pdf is proven to have generally a non-Gaussian behavior.
