more natural framework for constructing elements in the Hopf algebra of framed
mixed Tate motives according to Bloch and Kriz. This framework allows us to
extend our previous results to interpret all multiple zeta values (including
the divergent ones) and the multiple polylogarithms in one variable as elements
of this Hopf algebra. It implies that the pro-unipotent completion of the
torsor of paths on projective line minus three points, is a mixed Tate motive
in the sense of Bloch-Kriz. Also It allows us to interpret the multiple
logarithm as an element of this Hopf algebra as long as the products of
consecutive arguments are not 1.

growth of nanosize particles and colloids. The nanoparticles are synthesized as
nanocrystals, by burst nucleation from solution. The colloids are
self-assembled by aggregation of these nanocrystals. The two kinetic processes
are coupled, and both are driven by diffusional transport. The interrelation of
the two processes allows for formation of narrow-size-distribution colloid
dispersions which are of importance in many applications. We review a
mathematical model of cluster growth by capture of diffusing ""singlets."" Burst
nucleation of nanoparticles in solution is then analyzed. Finally, we couple it
to the secondary process of aggregation of nanoparticles to form colloids. We
address aspects of modeling of particle size distribution, as well as other

point-electron-singularity in the Maxwell field are expressed in a Colombeau
algebra of generalized functions. This enables one to calculate dynamical
quantities quadratic in the fields which are otherwise mathematically
ill-defined: The self-energy (i.e., `mass'), the self-angular momentum (i.e.,
`spin'), the self-momentum (i.e., `hidden momentum'), and the self-force. While
the total self-force and self-momentum are zero, therefore insuring that the
electron-singularity is stable, the mass and the spin are diverging integrals
of delta-squared-functions. Yet, after renormalization according to standard
prescriptions, the expressions for mass and spin are consistent with quantum
theory, including the requirement of a gyromagnetic ratio greater than one. The
most striking result, however, is that the electric and magnetic fields differ
from the classical monopolar and dipolar fields by delta-function terms which
are usually considered as insignificant, while in a Colombeau algebra these
terms are precisely the sources of the mechanical mass and spin of the
electron-singularity.

increased by a factor of ~9 in the u-band and by a factor of ~4-5 in the rest
of the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. (2003b).
In addition, we have achieved a high redshift completeness in our galaxy
samples. Firstly, by making use of the survey masks, provided by the NYU-VAGC
DR6, we have been able to define an area on the sky of high angular redshift
completeness. Secondly, we guarantee that brightness-dependent redshift
incompleteness is small within the magnitude ranges that define our galaxy
samples. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs in
both the bright and the faint end. In the {0.1}^r-band, our SDSS DR6 luminosity
function is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Phi_{*}=0.90 +/-
0.07$, M_{*}-5log_{10}h=-20.73 +/- 0.04 and alpha=-1.23 +/- 0.02. As compared
with previous results, we find some notable differences. In the bright end of
the {0.1}^u-band luminosity function we find a remarkable excess, of ~1.7 dex
at M_{{0.1}^u}=-20.5, with respect to the best-fit Schechter LF. This excess
weakens in the {0.1}^g-band, fading away towards the very red {0.1}^z-band. A
preliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is
mostly comprised of active galaxies and QSOs. It seems, therefore, that an
important fraction of this exceeding luminosity may come from nuclear activity.
In the faint end of the SDSS DR6 luminosity functions, where we can reach 1-1.5
magnitudes deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimation, we obtain a steeper
slope [ABRIDGED].

on the percolating cluster decreases with site dilution $x$, vanishing very
close to the percolation threshold. We compare our results in the Heisenberg

that can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The principle is
composed of a mathematical expression and an associated interpretation, and
establishes a correlation between the positions of a particle at two different
times. Under reasonable conditions for the wave function, this correlation
implies that the particles follow quasi-classical trajectories. It is also
shown that the Born rule is equivalent to a particular case of the new
principle. These features allow the principle to provide a unified explanation
of the results of the statistical experiments and of the quasi-classical
macroscopic evolution.
  There is a strong analogy between the new quantum principle and a
probabilistic principle which is necessary to derive empirical predictions from
the mathematical formalism of probability theory. This principle is referred to
by some authors as Cournot's principle, while other authors use the equivalent
notion of typicality. In this paper probability theory and quantum mechanics
are formulated in such a way as to explicitly include the two principles and to
emphasize the very similar conceptual structure of the two theories.

stars known to harbour cold debris discs have been obtained in the
near-infrared K band with the FLUOR instrument at the CHARA Array. The measured
squared visibilities are compared to the expected visibility of the stellar
photospheres based on theoretical photospheric models taking into account
rotational distortion, searching for potential visibility reduction at short
baselines due to circumstellar emission. Our observations bring to light the
presence of resolved circumstellar emission around one of the six target stars
(zeta Aql) at the 5 sigma level. The morphology of the emission source cannot
be directly constrained because of the sparse spatial frequency sampling of our
interferometric data. Using complementary adaptive optics observations and
radial velocity measurements, we find that the presence of a low-mass companion
is a likely origin for the excess emission. The potential companion has a
K-band contrast of four magnitudes, a most probable mass of about 0.6 Msun, and
is expected to orbit between about 5.5 AU and 8 AU from its host star assuming
a purely circular orbit. Nevertheless, by adjusting a physical debris disc
model to the observed Spectral Energy Distribution of the zeta Aql system, we
also show that the presence of hot dust within 10 AU from zeta Aql, producing a
total thermal emission equal to 1.69 +- 0.31% of the photospheric flux in the K
band, is another viable explanation for the observed near-infrared excess. Our
re-interpretation of archival near- to far-infrared photometric measurements
shows however that cold dust is not present around zeta Aql at the sensitivity
limit of the IRS and MIPS instruments onboard Spitzer, and urges us to remove
zeta Aql from the category of bona fide debris disc stars.

in low spectral resolution (R=35), and in medium spectral resolution (R=1500)
centered on the CO bandheads. The medium resolution AMBER observations clearly
resolve the CO bandheads. Both the CO bandheads and continuum emissions are
spatially resolved by the interferometer. Using simple analytical ring models
to interpret the measured visibilities, we find that the CO bandheads emission
region is compact, located at $0.15_{-0.04}^{0.07}$AU from the star, and that
the adjacent continuum is coming from a region further away
$0.25_{-0.03}^{0.06}$AU. These results confirm the commonly invoked scenario in
which the CO bandheads originate in a dust free hot gaseous disk. Furthermore,
the continuum emitting region is closer to the star than the dust sublimation
radius (by at least a factor two) and we suggest that hot gas inside the dust
sublimation radius significantly contributes to the observed 2 $\mu$m continuum
emission.

configurations allows one to remove 8 out of 24 fermionic degrees of freedom.
The remaining 16 fermions together with their bosonic partners should describe

demonstrate that in the plane-wave limit the quadratic action arising from our

sigma-model is classically integrable which opens up the possibility to
investigate its dynamics in a way very similar to the case of AdS_5 x S^5

core collapse to a proto-neutron star, using two different microphysical
nonzero-temperature nuclear equations of state as well as an approximate
description of deleptonization during the collapse phase. Investigating a wide
variety of rotation rates and profiles as well as masses of the progenitor
stars and both equations of state, we confirm in this very general setup the
recent finding that a generic gravitational wave burst signal is associated
with core bounce, already known as type I in the literature. The previously
suggested type II (or ""multiple-bounce"") waveform morphology does not occur.
Despite this reduction to a single waveform type, we demonstrate that it is
still possible to constrain the progenitor and postbounce rotation based on a
combination of the maximum signal amplitude and the peak frequency of the
emitted gravitational wave burst. Our models include to sufficient accuracy the
currently known necessary physics for the collapse and bounce phase of
core-collapse supernovae, yielding accurate and reliable gravitational wave
signal templates for gravitational wave data analysis. In addition, we assess
the possiblity of nonaxisymmetric instabilities in rotating nascent
proto-neutron stars. We find strong evidence that in an iron core-collapse
event the postbounce core cannot reach sufficiently rapid rotation to become
subject to a classical bar-mode instability. However, many of our postbounce
core models exhibit sufficiently rapid and differential rotation to become
subject to the recently discovered dynamical instability at low rotation rates.

choose probability distributions over moves, rather than single moves. Given a
goal, for example, reach a target state, the question of winning is thus a
probabilistic one: what is the maximal probability of winning from a given
state?
  On these game structures, two fundamental notions are those of equivalences
and metrics. Given a set of winning conditions, two states are equivalent if
the players can win the same games with the same probability from both states.
Metrics provide a bound on the difference in the probabilities of winning
across states, capturing a quantitative notion of state similarity.
  We introduce equivalences and metrics for two-player game structures, and we
show that they characterize the difference in probability of winning games
whose goals are expressed in the quantitative mu-calculus. The quantitative
mu-calculus can express a large set of goals, including reachability, safety,

provide the canonical extensions to games, of the classical notion of
bisimulation for transition systems. We develop our results both for
equivalences and metrics, which generalize bisimulation, and for asymmetrical
versions, which generalize simulation.

the model with the probability distribution of the turbulent dissipation rate

value of d=1.64. We apply this intermittency model to the computation of the
mass-weighted probability distribution of the gas temperature of molecular
clouds, high-mass star-forming cores, and cold diffuse HI clouds. Our main
results are: i) The mean gas temperature in molecular clouds can be explained
as the effect of turbulent heating alone, while cosmic ray heating may dominate
only in regions where the turbulent heating is low; ii) The mean gas
temperature in high-mass star-forming cores with typical FWHM of ~6 km/s
(corresponding to a 1D rms velocity of 2.5 km/s) may be completely controlled
by turbulent heating, which predicts a mean value of approximately 36 K, two to
three times larger than the mean gas temperature in the absence of turbulent
heating; iii) The intermittency of the turbulent heating can generate enough
hot regions in cold diffuse HI clouds to explain the observed CH+ abundance, if
the rms velocity on a scale of 1 pc is at least 3 km/s, in agreement with
previous results based on incompressible turbulence. Because of its importance

off-center flame ignition in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The simulations are
unique in terms of the degree to which non-idealized physics is used to treat
the reactive flow, including weak reaction rates and a time dependent treatment
of material in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). Careful attention is paid
to accurately calculating the final composition of material which is burned to
NSE and frozen out in the rapid expansion following the passage of a detonation
wave over the high density core of the white dwarf; and an efficient method for
nucleosynthesis post-processing is developed which obviates the need for costly
network calculations along tracer particle thermodynamic trajectories.
Observational diagnostics are presented for the explosion models, including
abundance stratifications and integrated yields. We find that for all of the
ignition conditions studied here, a self regulating process comprised of
neutronization and stellar expansion results in final \iso{Ni}{56} masses of
$\sim$1.1\msun. But, more energetic models result in larger total NSE and
stable Fe peak yields. The total yield of intermediate mass elements is

C$^*$-subalgebra of $M(G)^* = C_0(G)^{**}$. The proof builds upon a
factorisation result, due to Young and Kaiser, for weakly compact module maps.
The main technique is to adapt some of the theory of corepresentations to the
setting of general reflexive Banach spaces.

gas expelled by supernovae. With reasonable assumptions for the stripping of
this material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significant
fraction of their hot gas for several Gigayears, thereby replenishing their
reservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively long
period of time. A bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to that
observed in SDSS data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxies

for the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from small

objects detected in the image, with magnitudes 26 < F814W < 30. We measure the
redshift of the parent elliptical galaxy, using GMOS on Gemini South, to be z =
0.089 (375 Mpc). This galaxy, and its associated clusters, therefore ranks as
one of the most distant such systems discovered to date. The measured light
from these clusters was emitted 1.2 Gyr ago (the lookback time) and therefore
the optical properties hold clues for understanding the evolution of GCs over
the past Gyr. We measure the color function of the bright GCs and find that
both a blue and red population exist, and that the colors of each
sub-population are redder than GCs in local elliptical galaxies of comparable
luminosity. For the blue clusters, the observed color difference from z = 0.089
to today is only slightly larger than predictions from stellar evolution (e.g.,
changes in the luminosity and color of the main-sequence turnoff and the
morphology of the horizontal branch). A larger color difference is found in the
red clusters, possibly suggesting that they are very metal-rich and/or
significantly younger than 12 Gyr.

consistent manner to remove the biases introduced by limited sensitivity and
resolution, thus obtaining reliable sizes, velocity dispersions, and
luminosities. We compare the results obtained in dwarf galaxies with those from
the Local Group spiral galaxies. We find that extragalactic GMC properties
measured across a wide range of environments are very much compatible with
those in the Galaxy. We use these results to investigate metallicity trends in
the cloud average column density and virial CO-to-H2 factor. We find that these
measurements do not accord with simple predictions from
photoionization-regulated star formation theory, although this could be due to
the fact that we do not sample small enough spatial scales or the full
gravitational potential of the molecular cloud. We also find that the virial
CO-to-H2 conversion factor in CO-bright GMCs is very similar to Galactic, and
that the excursions do not show a measurable metallicity trend. We contrast
these results with estimates of molecular mass based on far-infrared
measurements obtained for the Small Magellanic Cloud, which systematically
yield larger masses, and interpret this discrepancy as arising from large H2
envelopes that surround the CO-bright cores. We conclude that GMCs identified

conventional prompt and afterglow photons originate from synchrotron radiation,
we compare an accompanying inverse-Compton component with EGRET measurements
and upper limits on GeV fluence, taking Klein-Nishina feedback into account. We
find that EGRET constraints are consistent with the theoretical framework of
the synchrotron self-Compton model for both prompt and afterglow phases, and
discuss constraints on microphysical parameters in both phases. Based on the
inverse-Compton model and using EGRET results, we predict that GLAST would
detect GRBs with GeV photons at a rate >~20 yr^{-1} from each of the prompt and
afterglow phases. This rate applies to the high-energy tail of the prompt
synchrotron emission and to the inverse-Compton component of the afterglow.
Theory predicts that in a large fraction of the cases where synchrotron GeV
prompt emission would be detected by GLAST, inverse-Compton photons should be
detected as well at high energies >~10 GeV. Therefore GLAST will enable a more
precise test of the high-energy emission mechanism. Finally, we show that the
contribution of GRBs to the flux of the extragalactic gamma-ray background
measured with EGRET is at least 0.01% and likely around 0.1%.

  ""Observational Evidence of Black Holes"", Kolkata, February 2008",,"10.1063/1.3009467",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We summarize indirect empirical arguments used for estimating black hole (BH)
masses in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The interpretation of the X-ray
data is still too model-dependent to provide tight constraints, but masses <~
100 Msun seem the most likely. It is getting clearer that ULXs do not show the
same evolutionary sequence between canonical spectral states as stellar-mass
BHs, nor the same timescale for state transitions. Most ULX spectra are
consistent either with a power-law-dominated state (apparently identical to the
canonical low/hard state), or with a very high state (or slim-disk state).
Despite often showing luminosity variability, there is little evidence of ULXs
settling into a canonical high/soft state, dominated by a standard disk
(disk-blackbody spectrum). It is possible that the mass accretion rate (but not
necessarily the luminosity) is always higher than Eddington; but there may be
additional physical differences between stellar-mass BHs and ULXs, which
disfavour transitions to the standard-disk, radio-quiet state in the latter
class. We speculate that the hard state in ULXs is associated with jet or
magnetic processes rather than an ADAF, can persist up to accretion rates ~
Eddington, and can lead directly to the very high state.

better separate, resulting in a best value of 2.9 kpc to define the inner limit

for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata

non-convex, we show that the capacity can be larger than the formula obtained
by the naive approach of imposing constraints on the maximization in the
capacity formula of the case without the constraints.
  The extension on the converse proof is simply by adding a term involving the
Lagrange multiplier and the constraints. The rest of the proof does not need to
be changed. We name the proof method the Lagrangian Converse Proof. In
contrast, traditional approaches need to construct a better input distribution
for convex problems or need to introduce a time sharing variable for non-convex
problems. We illustrate the Lagrangian Converse Proof for three channels, the
classic discrete time memoryless channel, the channel with non-causal
channel-state information at the transmitter, the channel with limited
channel-state feedback. The extension to the rate distortion theory is also
provided.

enhances the system's ability to maintain homeostasis in a changing environment

Stability is further enhanced when replicating systems develop dependencies, by
sharing information or resources. Such systems co-evolve, becoming more
independent of the external environment. Nested systems have a hierarchy of
dependency but have low algorithmic entropy as they are in principle simpler to
describe algorithmically. Nesting of replicating systems offsets the need for
increased variety by allowing the structures to increase in organizational
complexity with little increase in algorithmic entropy. Chaitin's d-diameter
complexity provides a measure of the level of order in nested replicating

companion. Its X-ray variability indicates modulation possibly on time scales
of the rotation period of the Herbig Ae star, and this would imply that the
primary significantly contributes to the overall emission. The spectrum of the
Herbig Ae+K3 system shows a soft component significantly more pronounced than
in other K-type young stars. This soft emission is reminiscent of the unusually
soft spectra observed for the single Herbig Ae stars HD 163296 and AB Aur, and
therefore we tentatively attribute it to the Herbig Ae of the binary system.

plasma temperatures. The He-like triplet of MgXI and NeIX suggest the presence
of plasma at densities of about $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, possibly indicating
accretion related X-ray production mechanism.

the coherences between subspaces of fixed particle number at each site are not
accessible and any state is therefore equivalent to its projection onto these

that available in the absence of the SSR. An ancilla can be used as a reference
system to increase the amount of accessible entanglement. We examine the

$\psi$(4415) are precisely interpreted by using of harmonic quarks and their
complete oscillators. Upper part of the charmonium spectrum consists of two
groups. Except for two particles ($\psi$(3770) and $\psi$(4040)) connected
among themselves, the others 5 particles are connected with a meson
$\psi$(4415). The levels are separated by elementary groups of harmonic quarks
and completed oscillators. Experimental and calculated data are in the good
consent. The masses of mesons $\psi$(4415), $X$(4260), $\psi$(4160), $X$(3943)
and $\chi$(3929) were recalculated. The second group demonstrates that harmonic
quarks can also well work below threshold $D\bar{D}$.

Hall effect of electrons on a two-dimensional square lattice with electron
dispersion appropriate to the high T$_c$ cuprates. We first consider the cases
where the magnitudes of the spin and charge stripe potentials are smaller than
or of the same order as the bandwidth of the two-dimensional electrons, so that
the electronic properties are not too strongly one-dimensional. In a model with
only spin stripe potential, and at carrier concentrations appropriate to
hole-doped cuprates, increasing the stripe scattering potential from zero leads
to an increase in $R_H$, followed by a sign change. If the scattering amplitude
is yet further increased, a second sign change occurs. The results are in
semiquantitative agreement with data. In a charge-stripe-potential-only model,
$R_H$ increases as the charge stripe scattering strength increases, with no
sign change occurring. In a model with both spin and charge stripe potentials,
$R_H$ may be enhanced or may change sign, depending on the strengths of the two
scattering potentials. We also consider the case in which the magnitudes of the
stripe potentials are much larger than the bandwidth, where analytical results
can be obtained. In this limit, the system is quasi-one-dimensional, while
$R_H$ remains finite and its sign is determined by the carrier density and the

on the moving nuclear surface. The values of $E_{IVGDR}A^{1/3}$ and $\kappa
(A)$ increase with $A$. The obtained value of the enhancement factor is about
10% for light nuclei and reaches approximately 20% for heavy nuclei. A fit of
the enhancement factor to the proper experimental data provides a value for the
isovector Landau amplitude of $F'_1\simeq 1.1$.

not binaries, by combining proper motions and radial velocity measurements. We
concentrate our analysis on the determination of stellar effective temperature,
using analyses of line-depth ratios and H$\alpha$ wings, making a direct
comparison with the solar spectrum obtained with the same instrument. We also
compute the lithium abundance for all the stars.Ten stars have both the
temperature derived by line-depth ratios and H$\alpha$ wings within 100 K from
the Sun. From these stars we derive, assuming a cluster reddening
$E(B-V)=0.041$, the solar colour $(B-V)_\odot=0.649\pm0.016$ and a cluster
distance modulus of 9.63. Five stars are most similar (within 60 K) to the Sun
and candidates to be true solar twins. These stars have also a low Li content,
comparable to the photospheric abundance of the Sun, likely indicating a
similar mixing evolution. We find several candidates for the best solar
analogues ever. These stars are amenable to further spectroscopic
investigations and planet search. The solar colours are determined with rather
high accuracy with an independent method, as well as the cluster distance
modulus.

the topological entanglement entropy, depends only on the system's universality
class and encodes non-trivial information about the topology of the system. We
relate it to universal $g$ factors and partition functions of (boundary)

VLT/FLAMES spectra of the infrared Calcium II triplet. Using both velocity and
metallicity information we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very-likely
members of M54 and of Sgr,N, respectively. The two considered systems display
significantly different velocity dispersion profiles: M54 has a steeply
decreasing profile from r=0, where sigma= 14.2 km/s, to r=3.5 arcmin where it
reaches sigma=5.3 km/s, then it appears to rise again to sigma= 10 km/s at r=7
arcmin. In contrast Sgr,N has a uniformly flat profile at sigma=9.6 km/s over
the whole 0 < r < 9 arcmin range. Using data from the literature we show that
the velocity dispersion of Sgr remains constant at least out to r ~ 100 arcmin
and there is no sign of the transition between the outer
flat-luminosity-profile core and the inner nucleus in the velocity profile.
These results - together with a re-analysis of the surface brightness profile
of Sgr,N and a suite of dedicated N-body simulations - provide very strong

forming stars, but a small fraction of BLGs do not show evidence for current
star formation activity. Differences of other physical parameters among
different classes are inspected, and their implication on galaxy evolution is

magnetic field and an impinging flux of cosmic rays of solar neighbourhood

ray interactions, including effects of losses due to pion production collisions
during diffusive propagation into the cloud complex.

  From the spectral energy distribution the emission appears to be thermal at
all frequencies. Before using these data to constrain the predicted synchrotron
flux, we first model the spectrum as free-free emission from the known ultra
compact HII regions plus emission from an envelope or wind with a radial
density gradient. This severely constrains the possible synchrotron emission by
secondary electrons to quite low flux levels. The absence of a significant
contribution by secondary electrons is almost certainly due to multi-GeV energy
cosmic rays being unable to penetrate far into giant molecular clouds. This
would also explain why 100 MeV--GeV gamma-rays (from neutral pion decay or
bremsstrahlung by secondary electrons) were not observed from Sgr B2 by EGRET,
while TeV energy gamma-rays were observed, being produced by higher energy
cosmic rays which more readily penetrate giant molecular clouds.

and its 0.3--7.0 keV emission spectrum was well described by an absorbed power
law with photon index 1.44$\pm$0.12. Its variability and emission is
characteristic of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the low-hard state,
whether the accretor is a neutron star or black hole. Such behaviour is
typically observed at luminosities $\la$10% Eddington. However, XBo 45

~30 years, consistent with theoretical prediction for a globular cluster black
hole binary formed via tidal capture. Bo 375 was observed in the 2007, January

efficient formation of H2O (D2O) with a rate that is surprisingly independent

different final configurations depending on the process, direct deposit of

amplifies the excitation of the matrix, in particular at the side of the Ar

interacting excitons through infinite series of composite-boson operators for
both, the system Hamiltonian and the exciton commutator -- which, in this
approach, is properly kept different from its elementary boson value. Instead
of free electron-hole operators, as used by Mukamel's group, we here work with
composite-exciton operators which are physically relevant operators for excited
semiconductors. This allows us to get \emph{all} terms of these infinite series
explicitly, the first terms of each series agreeing with the ones obtained by
Mukamel's group when written with electron-hole pairs. All these terms nicely
read in terms of Pauli and interaction scatterings of the composite-exciton
many-body theory we have recently proposed. However, even if knowledge of these
infinite series now allows to tackle $N$-body problems, not just 2-body
problems like third order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$, the necessary
handling of these two infinite series makes this approach far more complicated
than the one we have developed and which barely relies on just four
commutators.

at ~60 degs with an inner hole diameter of 250 mas (35 AU), approximately 5X
larger than the apparent separation of the binary components. In addition, we
report a new measurement along the binary orbit using near-infrared Keck
aperture masking, allowing a crude estimate of orbital parameters and the
system mass for the first time. The size of the inner hole appears to be
consistent with the minimum size prediction from tidal truncation theory,
bearing a resemblance to the recently unmasked binary CoKu Tau/4. Our results
have motivated a re-analysis of the system spectral energy distribution,
concluding the luminosity of this system has been severely underestimated. With
further study and monitoring, v892 Tau should prove a powerful testing ground
for both predictions of dynamical models for disk-star interactions in young
systems with gas-rich disks and for calibrations of pre-main-sequence tracks

sample of Ly-alpha galaxies, and an additional three have been confirmed
through follow-up infrared spectroscopy. The three newly confirmed objects lie
within a few hundred km/s of each other, but are blueshifted with respect to
the radio galaxy and Ly-alpha emitters by ~2100 km/s. Although the sample is
currently small, our results indicate that the radio-selected protocluster is
forming at the centre of a larger, ~60 co-moving Mpc super-structure. On the
basis of an HST/ACS imaging study we calculate dust-corrected star-formation
rates and investigate morphologies and sizes of the [O III] candidate emitters.

velocity: and continuum flux. The correlation between velocity and luminosity
has been explored previously by Laor & Brandt, but at a significantly higher
redshift and heavily weighted by broad absorption line quasars. We also have
examined each object with multiple observations for variability in each of the

continuum flux. In our survey, we find that variability of O VI lambda1032,
lambda1038 is less common than of the UV doublets of CIV and N V seen at longer
wavelengths, because the O VI absorption is usually saturated. Lyman beta
absorption variability is more frequent. In a target-by-target examination we
find that broad absorption line absorption and narrow absorption line absorbers
are related in terms of maximum outflow velocity and luminosity, and both can
be exhibited in similar luminosity objects. We also find one object that shows
radial velocity change, seven objects that show equivalent width variability,

that FPCA is a dimension reduction tool which is the first step to develop
model assisted approaches that can take auxiliary information into account.
FPCA relies on the estimation of the eigenelements of the covariance operator
which can be seen as nonlinear functionals. Adapting to our functional context
the linearization technique based on the influence function developed by
Deville (1999), we prove that these estimators are asymptotically design
unbiased and consistent. Under mild assumptions, asymptotic variances are
derived for the FPCA' estimators and consistent estimators of them are
proposed. Our approach is illustrated with a simulation study and we check the
good properties of the proposed estimators of the eigenelements as well as
their variance estimators obtained with the linearization approach.

subject of debate for the last 30 years. A relation between the X-ray

mechanism of formation in these stars (photoionization by coronal radiation
followed by recombination and cascade, or collisional excitation in the
chromosphere), has not yet been established. We use modern instrumentation
(NOT/SOFIN) and a direct measurement of the EUV flux, which photoionizes He I,
to investigate the formation mechanism of the line for the most active stars
which are frequently excluded from analysis. We have observed with an
unprecedented resolution (R~170,000) the He I 10830 A triplet in a set of 15
stars that were also observed with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) in
order to compare the line strengths with their EUV and X-ray fluxes. Active
dwarf and subgiant stars do not exhibit a relation between the EUV flux and the
equivalent width of the He I 10830 A line. Giant stars however, show a positive
correlation between the strength of the He I 10830 A absorption and the EUV and
X-ray fluxes. The strength of the C IV 1550 A emission does not correlate with
coronal fluxes in this sample of 15 stars. Active dwarf stars may have high
chromospheric densities thus allowing collisional excitation to dominate
photoionization/recombination processes in forming the He I 10830 A line.
Active giant stars possess lower gravities, and lower chromospheric densities
than dwarfs, allowing for photoexcitation processes to become important.
Moreover, their extended chromospheres allowfor scattering of infrared
continuum radiation, producing strong absorption in He I and tracing wind
dynamics.

candidate. It is located at the projected intersection of two faint stellar
tidal streams wrapped around the interacting pair of galaxies NGC 3227/6
(Arp~94). Using the IRAM 30m telescope, emission from CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) was
detected across the entire extent of the neutral hydrogen cloud associated with
J1023+1952, a region of the size of 8.9$ x 5.9 kpc, as well as in the nuclear
region and outer disk of NGC 3227. The molecular gas is found to be abundant
over the entire HI cloud, with H2-to-HI gas mass ratios between 0.5 and 1.7.
New Spitzer mid-infrared observations at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 15 and 24mu show
that young SF is restricted to the southern part of the cloud. Despite the
relatively uniform H$_2$ and HI column density across the cloud, young SF
occurs only where the velocity dispersion in the CO and HI is a factor of
$\sim$two lower (FWHM of 30 - 70 \kms) than elsewhere in the cloud (FWHM of 80
- 120 \kms). Thus the kinematics of the gas, in addition to its column density,
seems to be a crucial factor in triggering SF. Optical/infrared spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and Halpha photometry confirm that all the knots are
young, with a tentative age sequence from the south-west (oldest knots) to the
north-east (youngest). Optical spectroscopy of the brightest SF region allowed
us to determine the metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 8.6 +- 0.2) and the extinction
($A_B$=2.4). This shows that J1023+1952 is made from metal-enriched gas which
is inconsistent with the hypothesis that it represents a pre-existing dwarf
galaxy. Instead, it must be formed from recycled, metal-enrichd gas, expelled
from NGC 3227 or NGC 3226 in a previous phase of the interaction.

spin of a single NV center in diamond, using the effects of cavity quantum
electrodynamics. The scheme we propose is based in the one dimensional atom or
Purcell regime, removing the need for high Q cavities that are challenging to
fabricate. The ground state of the NV center consists of three spin levels
$^{3}A_{(m=0)}$ and $^{3}A_{(m=\pm1)}$ (the $\pm1$ states are near degenerate
in zero field). These two states can undergo transitions to the excited
($^{3}E$) state, with an energy difference of $\approx7-10$ $\mu$eV between the
two. By choosing the correct Q factor, this small detuning between the two
transitions results in a dramatic change in the intensity of reflected light.
We show the change in reflected intensity can allow us to read out the ground
state spin using a low intensity laser with an error rate of
$\approx5.5\times10^{-3}$, when realistic cavity and experimental parameters
are considered. Since very low levels of light are used to probe the state of
the spin we limit the number of florescence cycles, thereby limiting the non
spin preserving transitions through the intermediate singlet state $^{1}A$.

Swift/BAT and RXTE/ASM light curves (LCs). We also investigate Vela5B/ASM and
ArielV/ASM archival data and confirm the previously reported ~290 d periodic
modulation, and therefore confirming that the super-orbital period is not
constant. Finally, we study RXTE/ASM LC before 2005 and find that the
previously reported ~150 d period is most likely an artifact due to the use of
a Fourier-power based analysis under the assumption that the modulation has a
constant period along the whole data sample. Instead, we find strong
indications of several discrete changes of the precession period, happening in
coincidence with soft and failed state-transition episodes. We also find a hint
of correlation between the period and the amplitude of the modulation. The
detection of gamma-rays above 100 GeV with MAGIC in September 2006 happened in
coincidence with a maximum of the super-orbital modulation. The next maximum
will happen between 2 and 14 of July 2008, when the observational conditions of
Cygnus X-1 with ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, such as MAGIC and VERITAS,
are optimal.

which various observable quantities including the non-Gaussianity parameter
f_{NL} can be analytically calculated was proposed recently. In particular, for
a two-brid inflation model with an exponential potential and the condition that
the end of inflation is an ellipse in the field space, it was found that, while
keeping the other observational quantities within the range consistent with
observations, large non-Gaussianity is possible for certain inflationary
trajectories, provided that the ratio of the two masses is large. One might
question whether the resulting large non-Gaussianity is specific to this
particular form of the potential and the condition for the end of inflation. In
this paper, we consider a model of multi-brid inflation with a potential given
by an exponential function of terms quadratic in the scalar field components.
We also consider a more general class of ellipses for the end of inflation than
those studied previously. Then, focusing on the case of two-brid inflation, we
find that large non-Gaussianity is possible in the present model even for the
equal-mass case. Then by tuning the model parameters, we find that there exist
models for which both the non-Gaussianity and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are
large enough to be detected in the very near future.
