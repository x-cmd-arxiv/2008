long-term variations for a variety of reasons. Here we investigate how systemic
proper motion, which steadily re-orients planetary orbit with respect to our
line of sight, affects the timing of transits. We find that in a typical system
with a period of several days proper motion at the level of 100 mas/yr makes
transit duration vary at a rate ~10-100 ms/yr. In some isolated systems this
variation is at the measurable level (can be as high as 0.6 s/yr for GJ436) and
may exceed all other transit timing contributions (due to the general
relativity, stellar quadrupole, etc.). In addition, proper motion causes
evolution of the observed orbital period via the Shklovskii effect at a rate
$\gtrsim 10$ $\mu$s/yr for the nearby transiting systems (0.26 ms/yr in GJ436),
which in some cases exceeds all other contributions to $\dot P$. Earth's motion
around the Sun gives rise to additional periodic timing signal (even for
systems with zero intrinsic proper motion) allowing a full determination of the
spatial orientation of the planetary orbit. Unlike most other timing effects
the proper motion signatures persist even in systems with zero eccentricity and
get stronger as the planetary period increases. They should be the dominant
cause of transit timing variations in isolated wide separation (periods of
months) systems that will be sought by Kepler.

compare the results with predictions from a set of LCDM models. In the models,
a high mass spiral can have a bulge with a present-day low B/T<0.2 only if it
did not undergo a major merger since z<2. The predicted fraction (~1.6%) of
high mass spirals, which have undergone a major merger since z<4 and host a
bulge with a present-day low B/T<0.2, is a factor of over thirty smaller than
the observed fraction (~66%) of high mass spirals with B/T<0.2. Thus, contrary
to common perception, bulges built via major mergers since z<4 seriously fail
to account for the bulges present in ~66% of high mass spirals. Most of these
present-day low B/T<0.2 bulges are likely to have been built by a combination
of minor mergers and/or secular processes since z<4.

detection methods based on the optimal image subtraction technique. The main
focus is on applying the detection methods to wide field supernova imaging
surveys and in particular to the Stockholm VIMOS Supernova Survey (SVISS). We
have constructed a supernova detection pipeline for imaging surveys. The core
of the pipeline is image subtraction using the ISIS 2.2 package. Using real
data from the SVISS we simulate supernovae in the images, both inside and
outside galaxies. The detection pipeline is then run on the simulated frames
and the effects of image quality and subtraction parameters on the detection
efficiency and photometric accuracy are studied. The pipeline allows efficient
detection of faint supernovae in the deep imaging data. It also allows
controlling and correcting for possible systematic effects in the SN detection
and photometry. We find such a systematic effect in the form of a small
systematic flux offset remaining at the positions of galaxies in the subtracted
frames. This offset will not only affect the photometric accuracy of the
survey, but also the detection efficiencies. Our study has shown that ISIS 2.2
works well for the SVISS data. We have found that the detection efficiency and
photometric accuracy of the survey are affected by the stamp selection for the
image subtraction and by host galaxy brightness. With our tools the subtraction
results can be further optimised, any systematic effects can be controlled and
photometric errors estimated, which is very important for the SVISS, as well as
for future SN searches based on large imaging surveys such as Pan-STARRS and
LSST.

temperature in the core, are essential for understanding how the core and the
mantle interact and for modelling the geodynamo which generates the planetary
magnetic field. However, there is a longstanding controversy surrounding the
identity and quantity of the light elements. Here, the theory of tricritical
phenomena is employed as a precise theoretical framework to study
solidification at the high pressures and temperatures where both experimental
and numerical methods are complicated to implement and have large uncertainties
in their results. Combining the theory with the most reliable iron melting data
and the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) seismic data, one obtains the
solidification temperature at the inner core boundary (ICB) for both pure iron
and for the alloy of iron and light elements in the actual core melt. One also
finds a value of about 2.5 mole% for the amount of light matter. In addition,
the density of both solid and liquid pure iron at its melting temperature is
found. This allows one to obtain the density of the light matter and thus to
identify it to be MgSiO3.

identical to that which explains the Roper resonance structure, its dominant
decay modes and its extraordinary low mass. A similar transformation mechanism
from the glue to the scalar field was discovered in $J/\Psi$ decays. The new

supernova explosion and the nucleosynthesis of the elements. The reactions
considered in this work are: (i) Neutrino interaction with A=3 and $^4$He
nuclei, in energies typical to core-collapse supernova. For $^4$He both the
neutral and charged current reactions were calculated, whereas only neutral
current reactions are calculated for A=3 nuclei. (ii) Photoabsorption on
$^4$He. This long standing problem has been the attraction of theoretical and
experimental efforts in the last three decades. The calculations make use of
two novel methods. the Lorentz Integral Transform (LIT) method, which is used
to transform the scattering problem to a bound state like problem. The
resulting equations are solved using the Effective Interaction in the
Hyperspherical Harmonics (EIHH) method.

edge state interferometer designed to observe quasiparticle interference

this work is that in addtion to these e/4 oscillations, periodic structures
corresponding to e/2 are also observed at 5/2 and at lowest temperatures.

signal generated by an ensemble of spots randomly created on the accretion disc

include general relativity effects shaping the signal on its propagation to a
distant observer. We analyse the PSD of a spotted disc light curve and show the
accuracy of our semi-analytical approach by comparing the obtained PSD with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations. The asymptotic slopes of PSD are 0 at low
frequencies and they drop to -2 at high frequencies, usually with a single
frequency break. More complex two-peak solutions also occur. The amplitude of
the peaks and their frequency difference depend on the inherent timescales of
the model. At intermediate frequencies, the intrinsic PSD is influenced by the
individual light curve profile as well as by the type of the underlying
process. However, even in cases when two Lorentzians seem to dominate the PSD,
it does not necessarily imply that two single oscillation mechanisms operate
simultaneously. Instead, it may well be the manifestation of the avalanche
mechanism. The main advantage of our approach is an insight in the model
functioning and the fast evaluation of the PSD.

Similar to previous studies, we find that for the bands that trace stellar mass
at these redshifts (3.6um, 4.5um) the evolution in M* is consistent with a
passively evolving population of galaxies with a high formation redshift (z_{f}
> 1.5). Using the 3.6um LF as a proxy for stellar luminosity we remove this
component from the MIR (5.8um & 8.0um) cluster LFs and measure the LF of dusty
star formation/AGN in clusters. We find that at z < 0.4 the bright end of the
cluster 8.0um LF is well-described by a composite population of quiescent
galaxies and regular star forming galaxies with a mix consistent with typical
cluster blue fractions; however, at z > 0.4, an additional population of dusty
starburst galaxies is required to properly model the 8.0um LFs. Comparison to
field studies at similar redshifts shows a strong differential evolution in the
field and cluster 8.0um LFs with redshift. At z ~ 0.65 8.0um-detected galaxies
are more abundant in clusters compared to the field, but thereafter the number
of 8.0um sources in clusters declines with decreasing redshift and by z ~ 0.15,
clusters are underdense relative to the field by a factor of ~5. The rapid
differential evolution between the cluster and field LFs is qualitatively
consistent with recent field galaxy studies that show the star formation rates
of galaxies in high density environments are larger than those in low density

power-law models, while both models yield similar column density estimates. The
better fit of the power-law model solves a long standing problem plaguing the
partial covering model when applied to large distance scale outflow: How to
obtain a velocity dependent covering factor for an outflow situated at

challenging. The surface brightness of these haloes are expected to be many
magnitudes below dark sky and the central brightness of the galaxy. Here I show
that in some of the recent literature the effect of very extended Point Spread
Function (PSF) tails on the measurements of halo light has been underestimated;
especially in the case of edge-on disc galaxies. The detection of a halo along
the minor axis of an edge-on galaxy in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field can largely
be explained by scattered galaxy light. Similarly, depending on filter and the
shape one assumes for the uncertain extended PSF, 20 to 80 per cent of the halo
light found along the minor axis of scaled and stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) edge-on galaxy images can be explained by scattered galaxy light.
Scattered light also significantly contributes to the anomalous halo colours of
stacked SDSS images. The scattered light fraction decreases when looking in the
quadrants away from the minor axis. The remaining excess light is well modelled
with a Sersic profile halo with shape parameters based on star count halo
detections of nearby galaxies. Even though the contribution from PSF scattered
light does not fully remove the need for extended components around these
edge-on galaxies, it will be very challenging to make accurate halo light shape
and colour measurements from integrated light without very careful PSF
measurements and scattered light modelling.

observed spectra and investigate the effects of varying gas metalicities and
the spectral energy distribution of the incident ionizing radiation field. The

scales. From first principles, we initiate the development of a mathematical
theory of stochastic microlensing. Beginning with the random time delay
function and associated lensing map, we determine exact expressions for the
mean and variance of these transformations. We characterize the exact p.d.f. of
a normalized random time delay function at the origin, showing that it is a
shifted gamma distribution, which also holds at leading order in the limit of a
large number of point masses at a general point of the lens plane. For the
large number of point masses limit, we also prove that the asymptotic p.d.f. of
the random lensing map under a specified scaling converges to a bivariate
normal distribution. We show analytically that the p.d.f. of the random scaled
lensing map at leading order depends on the magnitude of the scaled bending
angle due purely to point masses as well as demonstrate explicitly how this
radial symmetry is broken at the next order. Interestingly, we found at leading
order a formula linking the expectation and variance of the normalized random
time delay function to the first Betti number of its domain. We also determine
an asymptotic p.d.f. for the random bending angle vector and find an integral
expression for the probability of a lens plane point being near a fixed point.
Lastly, we show explicitly how the results are affected by location in the lens
plane. The results of this paper are relevant to the theory of random fields
and provide a platform for further generalizations as well as analytical limits
for checking astrophysical studies of stochastic microlensing.

perturbing planet is GJ 436, which hosts a hot transiting Neptune-mass planet
in an eccentric orbit. Ribas et al. (2008) suggested that such eccentricity and
a possible change in the orbital inclination might be due to a perturbing small
planet in a close-in orbit. A radial velocity signal of a 5 M_earth planet
close to the 2:1 mean-motion resonance seemed to provide the perfect candidate.
Recent new radial velocities have deemed such signal spurious. Here we put all
the available information in context and we evaluate the possibility of a small
perturber to GJ 436 b to explain its eccentricity and possible inclination
change. In particular, we discuss the constraints provided by the transit time
variation data. We conclude that, given the current data, the close-in
perturber scenario still offers a plausible explanation to the observed orbital
and physical properties of GJ 436 b.

for which both components are directly confirmed to be substellar. This is also
the coolest and lowest mass binary with a dynamical mass determination to date.
Using evolutionary models, we derive an age of 0.78+/-0.09 Gyr for the system,
and we find Teff = 1028+/-17 K and 978+/-17 K and masses of 0.0287+/-0.0016

individual components. These precise measurements generally agree with previous
studies of T dwarfs and affirm the current theoretical models. However, (1) the
temperatures are about 100 K cooler than derived for similar objects and
suggest that the ages of field brown dwarfs may be overestimated. Also, (2) the
H-R diagram positions are discrepant with current predictions. While this may
arise from large errors in the evolutionary models, the likely cause is a
modest (~100 K) overestimate in temperatures determined from model atmospheres.
We discuss future tests of theory as the sample of substellar dynamical masses
increases. In particular, we suggest that low-mass field binaries with

Lyapunov exponents and vectors, guided by the asymptotic theory of partially
hyperbolic sets, with important modifications for the finite-time case; for
example, finite-time Lyapunov analysis relies more heavily on the Lyapunov
vectors due to their relatively fast convergence compared to that of the
corresponding exponents. The splitting is used to locate points on normally

achieve full-diversity with a linear receiver is proposed for a wireless
communication system having multiple transmitter and single receiver antennas
(MISO). Particularly, the STBC with Toeplitz structure satisfies this criterion
and therefore, enables full-diversity. Further examination of this Toeplitz
STBC reveals the following important properties: a) The symbol transmission
rate can be made to approach unity. b) Applying the Toeplitz code to any
signalling scheme having nonzero distance between the nearest constellation
points results in a non-vanishing determinant. In addition, if QAM is used as
the signalling scheme, then for independent MISO flat fading channels, the
Toeplitz codes is proved to approach the optimal diversity-vs-multiplexing
tradeoff with a ZF receiver when the number of channel uses is large. This is,
so far, the first non-orthogonal STBC shown to achieve the optimal tradeoff for
such a receiver. On the other hand, when ML detection is employed in a MISO
system, the Toeplitz STBC achieves the maximum coding gain for independent
channels. When the channel fading coefficients are correlated, the inherent
transmission matrix in the Toeplitz STBC can be designed to minimize the
average worst case pair-wise error probability.

Until now, measurements have been performed at low frequency, \textit{i.e.} in

from charge transfer process. We report here the first measurement of $S_3$ at
high frequency, in the quantum regime $\hbar \omega > eV, k_BT$. In this
regime, experiment cannot be seen as a charge counting statistics problem
anymore. It raises central questions of the statistics of quantum noise: 1) the
electromagnetic environment of the sample has been proven to strongly influence
the measurement, through the possible modulation of the noise of the sample.
What happens to this mechanism in the quantum regime? 2) For $\hbar \omega >
eV$, the noise is due to zero point fluctuations and keeps its equilibrium
value: $S_2= G \hbar \omega$ with $G$ the conductance of the sample. Therefore,
$S_2$ is independent of the bias voltage and no photon is emitted by the
conductor. Is it possible, as suggested by some theories, that $S_3 \neq 0$ in
this regime? With regard to these questions, we give theoretical and
experimental answers to the environmental effects showing that they involve
dynamics of the quantum noise. Using these results, we investigate the question

of electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of a black hole. Highly magnetized
disk accretion may play an importance rule, and large scale magnetic field may
be formed above the disk surface. Then, we expect that the nature of the black
hole spacetime would be reveiled by magnetic phenomena near the black hole. We
will start to investigate the motion of a charged particle which depends on the
initial parameter setting in the black hole dipole magnetic field. Specially,
we study the spin effects of a rotating black hole on the motion of the charged
particle trapped in magnetic field lines. We make detailed analysis for the
particle's trajectories by using the Poincar\'{e} map method, and show the
chaotic properties that depend on the black hole spin. We find that the
dragging effects of the spacetime by a rotating black hole weaken the chaotic
properties and generate regular trajectories for some sets of initial
parameters, while the chaotic properties dominate on the trajectories for
slowly rotating black hole cases. The dragging effects can generate the fourth
adiabatic invariant on the particle motion approximately.

three regions consistent with the WMAP data on dark matter relic density and
direct mass bounds from LEP 2. Each region can lead to distinct leptonic
signatures from squark-gluino events during the early LHC experiments
(integrated luminosity $\sim 10 ~fb^{-1}$ or even smaller). In the much studied
stau-LSP coannihilation region with a vanishing common trilinear coupling
($A_0$) at the GUT scale a large fraction of the final states contain electrons
and / or muons and $e$ - $\mu$ - $\tau$ universality holds to a good
approximation. In the not so well studied scenarios with non-vanishing $A_0$
both LSP pair annihilation and stau-LSP coannihilation could contribute
significantly to the dark matter relic density for even smaller squark-gluino
masses. Our simulations indicate that the corresponding signatures are final
states rich in $\tau$-leptons while final states with electrons and muons are
suppressed leading to a violation of lepton universality. These features may be
observed to a lesser extent even in the modified parameter space (with non-zero
$A_0$) where the coannihilation process dominates. We also show that the
generic $m$-leptons + $n$-jets+ $\not! E_T$ signatures without flavour tagging
can also discriminate among the three scenarios. However, the signals become
more informative if the $\tau$ and $b$-jet tagging facilities at the LHC

rearrangements of particle ``blobs'' of size
$\xi$\cite{WeeksScience2000,DauchotPRL2005,Glotzer,Ediger}. On approaching
these transitions, $\xi$ grows in glass-formers\cite{Glotzer,Ediger},

in/out of massive degrees of freedom in the dual field theory as the energy
scale is changed. We study how the dynamics of the theory depends on the flavor
parameters, mainly focusing on the static quark-antiquark potential. As
expected, we find that the dynamical flavors tend to screen the static color
charges.

electrically conducting fluids. It is less well known that cosmic magnetic
fields play also an active role in cosmic structure formation by enabling
outward transport of angular momentum in accretion disks via the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). Considerable theoretical and computational
progress has been made in understanding both processes. In addition to this,
the last ten years have seen tremendous efforts in studying both effects in
liquid metal experiments. In 1999, magnetic field self-excitation was observed
in the large scale liquid sodium facilities in Riga and Karlsruhe. Recently,
self-excitation was also obtained in the French ""von Karman sodium"" (VKS)
experiment. An MRI-like mode was found on the background of a turbulent
spherical Couette flow at the University of Maryland. Evidence for MRI as the
first instability of an hydrodynamically stable flow was obtained in the
""Potsdam Rossendorf Magnetic Instability Experiment"" (PROMISE). In this review,
the history of dynamo and MRI related experiments is delineated, and some
directions of future work are discussed.

type of K2V, Eps Eri is one of the most extensively studied systems in an
extrasolar planet context. Based on radial velocity, astrometry, and studies of
the structure of its circumstellar debris disk, at least two planetary
companion candidates to Eps Eri have been inferred in the literature (Eps Eri
b, Eps Eri c). Some of these methods also hint at additional companions
residing in the system. Here we present a new adaptive optics assisted
high-contrast imaging approach that takes advantage of the favourable planet
spectral energy distribution at 4 microns, using narrow-band angular
differential imaging to provide an improved contrast at small and intermediate
separations from the star. We use this method to search for planets at orbits
intermediate between Eps Eri b (3.4 AU) and Eps Eri c (40 AU). The method is
described in detail, and important issues related to the detectability of
planets such as the age of Eps Eri and constraints from indirect measurements
are discussed. The non-detection of companion candidates provides stringent
upper limits for the masses of additional planets. Using a combination of the
existing dynamic and imaging data, we exclude the presence of any planetary
companion more massive than 3 Mjup anywhere in the Eps Eri system.
Specifically, with regards to the possible residual linear radial velocity
trend, we find that it is unlikely to correspond to a real physical companion
if the system is as young as 200 Myr, whereas if it is as old as 800 Myr, there
is an allowed semi-major axis range between about 8.5 and 25 AU.

We find that the number of significantly Li-depleted stars in Taurus-Auriga is
greatly reduced with respect to earlier results. Only 13 stars have abundances
lower than the interstellar value by a factor of 5 or greater. All of them are
weak-lined T Tauri stars drawn from X-ray surveys; with the exception of four

turbulence with large-scale shear are discussed. We have found that the
shear-current dynamo can act even in random flows with small Reynolds numbers.
However, in this case mean-field dynamo requires small magnetic Prandtl numbers
(i.e., ${\rm Pm} < {\rm Pm}^{\rm cr}<1$). The threshold in the magnetic Prandtl
number, ${\rm Pm}^{\rm cr} = 0.24$, is determined using second order
correlation approximation (or first-order smoothing approximation) for a
background random flow with a scale-dependent viscous correlation time
$\tau_c=(\nu k^2)^{-1}$ (where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid
and $k$ is the wave number). For turbulent flows with large Reynolds numbers
shear-current dynamo occurs for arbitrary magnetic Prandtl numbers. This dynamo
effect represents a very generic mechanism for generating large-scale magnetic
fields in a broad class of astrophysical turbulent systems with large-scale
shear. On the other hand, mean-field dynamo due to homogeneous kinetic helicity
fluctuations alone in a sheared turbulence is not realistic for a broad class
of astrophysical systems because it requires a very specific random forcing of
kinetic helicity fluctuations that contains, e.g., low-frequency oscillations.

using the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model as a simple example. These systems
generically undergo a violent relaxation to a quasi-stationary state (QSS)
before relaxing towards Boltzmann equilibrium. In the collisional regime, the
out-of-equilibrium one-particle distribution function (DF) is a
quasi-stationary solution of the Vlasov equation, slowly evolving in time due
to finite $N$ effects. For subcritical energies $7/12<U<3/4$, we exhibit cases
where the DF is well-fitted by a Tsallis $q$-distribution with an index $q(t)$
slowly decreasing in time from $q\simeq 3$ (semi-ellipse) to $q=1$ (Boltzmann).
When the index $q(t)$ reaches a critical value $q_{crit}(U)$, the
non-magnetized (homogeneous) phase becomes Vlasov unstable and a dynamical
phase transition is triggered, leading to a magnetized (inhomogeneous) state.
While Tsallis distributions play an important role in our study, we explain
this dynamical phase transition by using only conventional statistical
mechanics. For supercritical energies, we report for the first time the
existence of a magnetized QSS with a very long lifetime.

space and time have to reflect their complete interdependence. Our intuitive
methods of always picturing one-dimensional space as a sum of unit-length rods
and of picturing one-dimensional time as consecutive ticks of a clock suggest
subconsciously that changes in space never alter time and vice versa. In this
paper, we present a compiled list of popular arguments against Special
Relativity, and we show how our erroneous intuitive conviction that the
definition of space is always independent of the definition of time and vice
versa is indeed the driving force behind these arguments. Once interdependence
between space and time is established within their respective definitions, it
is shown how such arguments are quickly resolved. Interdependence between space
and time is described in two different ways, which are mathematically different
but physically equivalent. We show how by assuming a time-independent
measurement tool for space, time should be defined in terms of space to reflect
their interdependence and this yields Lorentz Transformation. If we assume a
space-independent measurement tool for time, space should be defined in terms
of time, and this yields a different set of equations. Next, it is shown how
the two different faces of the coin of Special Relativity, while mathematically
different, are essentially equivalent from a physical point of view, and that
both yield the same laws of addition of velocity, length contraction and time
dilation effects. The apparent differences in physical interpretations between
the two sets of equations are attributed to the differences in the definitions

equations, involving in particular the first moments of the Boltzmann equation

result as well as an estimation of its order of magnitude. This allows to
quantify the expected deviation from Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave

on units that are naturally associated with an orthogonal vector space, a

in the context of the reals or the complex numbers.In this article the
complementing view is held, in that the laws of hypercomplex algebra are recast

volatility affects mostly the decay of links, the model exhibit a sharp
transition between an ordered phase with a dense network and a disordered phase
with a sparse network. When volatility is mostly node-based, instead, only the
symmetric (disordered) phase exists These two regimes are separated by a second
order phase transition of unusual type, characterized by an order parameter

computation which seeks to transform the initial ground state of a quantum
system into a final ground state encoding the answer to a computational
problem. AQC initial Hamiltonians conventionally have a uniform superposition
as ground state. We diverge from this practice by introducing a simple form of
heuristics: the ability to start the quantum evolution with a state which is a
guess to the solution of the problem. With this goal in mind, we explain the
viability of this approach and the needed modifications to the conventional AQC
(CAQC) algorithm. By performing a numerical study on hard-to-satisfy 6 and 7
bit random instances of the satisfiability problem (3-SAT), we show how this
heuristic approach is possible and we identify that the performance of the
particular algorithm proposed is largely determined by the Hamming distance of
the chosen initial guess state with respect to the solution. Besides the
possibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy
allows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the
measured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of
states as in CAQC. The outcome of the measurement can be used as a more refined
guess state to restart the adiabatic evolution. This concatenated restart
process is another heuristic that the CAQC strategy cannot capture.

  Another Solid Phase'","1 page, 1 figure. submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.049601",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a major controversy over the past seven years about the
high-pressure melting curves of transition metals. Static compression
(diamond-anvil cell: DAC) experiments up to the Mbar region give very low
melting slopes dT_m/dP, but shock-wave (SW) data reveal transitions indicating
much larger dT_m/dP values. Ab initio calculations support the correctness of
the shock data. In a very recent letter, Belonoshko et al. propose a simple and
elegant resolution of this conflict for molybdenum. Using ab initio
calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), they show that the
high-P/high-T phase diagram of Mo must be more complex than was hitherto
thought. Their calculations give convincing evidence that there is a transition
boundary between the normal bcc structure of Mo and a high-T phase, which they
suggest could be fcc. They propose that this transition was misinterpreted as
melting in DAC experiments. In confirmation, they note that their boundary also
explains a transition seen in the SW data. We regard Belonoshko et al.'s Letter
as extremely important, but we note that it raises some puzzling questions, and
we believe that their proposed phase diagram cannot be completely correct. We
have calculated the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies of the bcc, fcc and hcp
phases of Mo, using essentially the same quasiharmonic methods as used by
Belonoshko et al.; we find that at high-P and T Mo in the hcp structure is more
stable than in bcc or fcc.

halo mass function via group velocity dispersions; the stellar, HI, and
baryonic mass functions; galaxy component mass-size relations; the recent
merger and star-formation rates by mass, types and environment. Detailed
modeling of the spectra, broad SEDs, and spatial distributions should provide
individual star formation histories, ages, bulge-disc decompositions and
stellar bulge, stellar disc, dust disc, neutral HI gas and total dynamical

basically consists in the stamping of deformable surfaces or films. Preferred
materials are thermoplastics[4] and UV curable resists[5]. So far, most papers
report on single imprinting methods for which the same surface is imprinted
only once. In the present paper, we report the imprinting of square silica
structures from simple line gratings and demonstrate how the specific
thermo-rheological behavior of ICSG resists can be harnessed to form complex
structures by sequential imprinting at low pressures.
