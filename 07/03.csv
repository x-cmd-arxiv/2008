reduce QCD backgrounds. Jets from QCD are characterized by different patterns
of energy flow compared to the products of highly-boosted heavy particle
decays, and we employ a variety of jet shapes, observables restricted to energy
flow within a jet, to explore this difference. Results from Monte Carlo
generators and arguments based on perturbation theory support the
discriminating power of the shapes we refer to as planar flow and angularities.
We emphasize that for massive jets, these and other observables can be analyzed
perturbatively.

applied to a self-interacting scalar boson field is shown to make sense
mathematically in a framework of generalized functions adapted to nonlinear
operations.
  The free-field operators, their commutation relations, and the free-field
Hamiltonian operator are calculated by a straightforward transcription of the
usual formalism expressed in configuration space. This leads to the usual
results, which are essentially independent of the regularization, with the
exception of the zero-point energy which may be set to zero if a particular
regularization is chosen.
  The calculations for the self-interacting field are more difficult,
especially because of the well-known problems due to the unboundness of the
operators and their time-dependent domains. Nevertheless, a proper methodology
is developed and a differentiation on time-dependent domains is defined. The
Heisenberg equations and the interacting-field equation are shown to be
mathematically meaningful as operator-valued nonlinear generalized functions,
which therefore provide an alternative to the usual Bogoliubov-Wightman
interpretation of quantized fields as operator-valued distributions.
  The equation for the time-evolution operator is proved using two different
methods, but no attempt is made to calculate the scattering operator, and the
applications to perturbation theory are left to a subsequent report.

HYDRA, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and
prescriptions for chemical enrichment (taking into account contributions from
both SNIa and SNII), supernova feedback, and gas cooling. The models follow the
evolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing
dark-matter halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the
merger trees of isolated dwarf galaxies extracted from the milli-Millennium
Simulation.
  The star-formation histories of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like
behaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent
in-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to
be small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3x10^7 Msol and 6x10^7 Msol .
For the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their
initial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to
trigger star-bursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than
small residual star formation for the less massive models. Between these
star-bursts there can be time intervals of several Gyrs.
  We have compared model predictions with available data for the relations
between luminosity and surface brightness profile, half-light radius, central
velocity dispersion, broad band colour (B-V) and metallicity, as well as the
location relative to the fundamental plane. The properties of the model dwarf
galaxies agree quite well with those of observed dwarf galaxies.

out to study the superconducting gap in the (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 superconductor

exhibit different superconducting gaps. The inner Fermi surface sheet shows
larger (10-12 meV) and slightly momentum-dependent gap while the outer one has
smaller (7-8 meV) and nearly isotropic gap. The lack of gap node in both Fermi
surface sheets favours s-wave superconducting gap symmetry. Superconducting gap
opening is also observed at the M(pi,pi) point. The two Fermi surface spots
near the M point are gapped below Tc but the gap persists above Tc. The rich
and detailed superconducting gap information will provide key insights and
constraints in understanding pairing mechanism in the iron-based
superconductors.

part covers the various formulations of the free theory as well as Vasiliev's
full nonlinear equations, in particular focusing on their algebraic structure
and on their properties in various space-time signatures. Then, the original
results are presented. First, the 4D Vasiliev equations are formulated in
space-times with signatures (4-p,p) and non-vanishing cosmological constant,
and some new exact solutions are found, depending on continuous and discrete
parameters: (a) an SO(4-p,p)-invariant family of solutions; (b) non-maximally
symmetric solutions with vanishing Weyl tensors and higher-spin gauge fields,
that differ from the maximally symmetric background solutions in the auxiliary
field sector; and (c) solutions of the chiral models with an infinite tower of
Weyl tensors proportional to totally symmetric products of two principal
spinors. These are apparently the first exact 4D solutions with non-vanishing
massless higher-spin fields. Finally, a generalized harmonic expansion of the
Vasiliev's master zero-form is performed as a map from the associative algebra
A of operators on the singleton phase space to representations of the
background isometry algebra that include one-particle states along with
linearized runaway solutions. Such Harish-Chandra modules are unitarizable in a
Tr_A-norm rather than in the standard Killing norm. We also take the first
steps towards a regularization scheme for handling strongly coupled
higher-derivative interactions within this operator formalism.

It is shown that if this system is prepared in an equilibrium state, after
which a control parameter in the fictitious Hamiltonian is changed in a finite

fluctuation relation are shown to hold, where work is defined as the change in

number of X-ray sources in a globular cluster Nc=1.2 Gamma+1.1 Mh, where Gamma
is the collision number and Mh is (half of) the cluster mass, both normalized
to the values for the globular cluster M4. Some sources tentatively classified
as magnetically active binaries are more luminous in X-rays than the upper
limit of Lx~0.001Lbol of such binaries in the solar neighbourhood. Comparison
with XMM and ROSAT observations lead us to conclude that the brightest X-ray
source in M55, a dwarf nova, becomes fainter in X-rays during the optical
outburst, in accordance with other dwarf novae. The brightest X-ray source in
NGC 6366 is a point source surrounded by a slightly offset extended source. The

tests involving rotating superfluid films and vortex pinning are first
discussed for films coating gently curved substrates that can be treated in

vortex pinning induced by the varying thickness of the film which is in turn
caused by capillary effects and gravity. We then present a non-perturbative
technique based on conformal mappings that leads an exact solution for the

matter model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the
spin-1 single flavor (CSL), spin-0 two flavor (2SC) and three flavor (CFL)
channels. We find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation
density, n_0, when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due
to the flavor asymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At
about 3n_0 u-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase
is formed. The s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon
density, when the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically
generated strange quark mass. We construct two different hybrid equations of
state (EoS) using the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and the EoS
by Shen et al. in the nuclear matter sector. The corresponding hybrid star
sequences have maximum masses of, respectively, 2.1 and 2.0 M_sun. Two- and
three-flavor quark-matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid
star solutions in the DBHF case, while the Shen-based EoS produce stable
configurations with a 2SC phase-component in the core of massive stars. Nucleon
dissociation via d-quark drip could act as a deep crustal heating process,

Particular interest is given to electron energy-loss spectroscopy and
many-electron atomic spectral calculations, since there is now an appreciable
library of core d -> valence f transitions for Th, U, Np, Pu, Am, and Cm. These
results are interwoven and discussed against published experimental data, such
as x-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopy, transport measurements, and
electron, x-ray, and neutron diffraction, as well as theoretical results, such

understanding this new superconductor, as in the case of cuprates, is the
nature, in particular the symmetry and orbital dependence, of the
superconducting gap. There are conflicting experimental results, mostly from
indirect measurements of the low energy excitation gap, ranging from one gap to
two gaps, from line nodes to nodeless gap function in momentum space. Here we
report a direct observation of the superconducting gap, including its momentum,
temperature, and Fermi surface (FS) dependence in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (Tc = 37 K)
using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. We find two superconducting
gaps with different values: a large gap (~ 12 meV) on the two small hole-like
and electron-like FS sheets, and a small gap (~ 6 meV) on the large hole-like
FS. Both gaps, closing simultaneously at the bulk Tc, are nodeless and nearly
isotropic around their respective FS sheets. The isotropic pairing interactions
are strongly orbital dependent, as the ratio 2Delta/kBTc switches from weak to
strong coupling on different bands. The same and surprisingly large
superconducting gap due to strong pairing on the two small FS, which are
connected by the (pi, 0) spin-density-wave vector in the parent compound,
strongly suggests that the pairing mechanism originates from the inter-band
interactions between these two nested FS sheets.

models of electrical activity of myocardial tissue. The bidomain model is a
system consisting of a possibly degenerate parabolic PDE coupled with an
elliptic PDE for the transmembrane and extracellular potentials, respectively.
This system of two scalar PDEs is supplemented by a time-dependent ODE modeling
the evolution of the so-called gating variable. In the simpler sub-case of the
monodomain model, the elliptic PDE reduces to an algebraic equation. Two simple
models for the membrane and ionic currents are considered, the
Mitchell-Schaeffer model and the simpler FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Since typical
solutions of the bidomain and monodomain models exhibit wavefronts with steep
gradients, we propose a finite volume scheme enriched by a fully adaptive
multiresolution method, whose basic purpose is to concentrate computational
effort on zones of strong variation of the solution. Time adaptivity is
achieved by two alternative devices, namely locally varying time stepping and a
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg-type adaptive time integration. A series of numerical
examples demonstrates thatthese methods are efficient and sufficiently accurate
to simulate the electrical activity in myocardial tissue with affordable
effort. In addition, an optimalthreshold for discarding non-significant
information in the multiresolution representation of the solution is derived,
and the numerical efficiency and accuracy of the method is measured in terms of
CPU time speed-up, memory compression, and errors in different norms.

estimated a correction to the canonical Newtonian-Einsteinian Venus' perihelion

general relativity for the Lense-Thirring precession of the perihelion of Venus
is -0.0003 arcseconds per century. It turns out that neither other
mismodelld/unmodelled standard Newtonian/Einsteinian effects nor exotic ones,
postulated to, e.g., explain the Pioneer anomaly, may have caused the

attributed to the gravitomagnetic field of the Sun, not modelled in the

larger. Future improvements of the inner planets' ephemerides, with the

the early stages of its outburst. The high-ionisation line of HeII 4686A is the
most centrally located line and has the greatest radial extension compared to
the HeI lines. The Balmer lines extend from close to the white dwarf up to
approximately 0.45 times R_L, with the outer radius gradually increasing when
moving from H delta to H alpha. The application, for the first time, of the
modulation Doppler tomography technique, maps any harmonically varying
components present in the system configuration. We find, as expected, that part
of the strong secondary star emission in Balmer and HeI lines is modulated
predominantly with the cosine term, consistent with the emission originating
from the irradiated front side of the mass-donor star, facing the accreting
white dwarf. For the Balmer lines the level of the modulation, compared to the
average emission, decreases when moving to higher series. Emission from the
extended accretion disk appears to be only weakly modulated, with amplitudes of
at most a few percent of the non-varying disk emission. We find no evidence of
modulated emission in the spiral arms, which if present, is relatively weak at
that our signal-to-noise ratio was good enough to put a lower detection limit
of any modulated emission at 5--6%. Only in one arm of the HeII 4686A line, is
there a possibility of modulated emission, but again, we cannot be sure this is
not caused by blending with the nearby Bowen complex of lines.

Microwave Background is one of the main challenges of modern cosmology. The
expected level of the B-mode signal is very low and therefore requires the
development of highly sensitive instruments with low systematic errors. An
appealing possibility is bolometric interferometry. Aims. We compare in this
article the sensitivity on the CMB angular power spectrum achieved with direct
imaging, heterodyne and bolometric interferometry. Methods. Using a simple
power spectrum estimator, we calculate its variance leading to the counterpart
for bolometric interferometry of the well known Knox formula for direct
imaging. Results. We find that bolometric interferometry is less sensitive than
direct imaging. However, as expected, it is finally more sensitive than
heterodyne interferometry due to the low noise of the bolometers. It therefore
appears as an alternative to direct imagers with different and possibly lower
systematic errors, mainly due to the absence of an optical setup in front of
the horns.

plateau is also produced by continued fall-back of matter -- either from an
extended stellar envelope or from material that failed to escape with the

point vortices in a plane by deriving governing equations for triangular
configurations of the vortices. Synge (1949) took this formulation one step
further to that of a similar triangle of unit perimeter, via trilinear
coordinates. The final reduced problem is governed by an integrable
two-dimensional system of differential equations with solutions represented as
planar trajectories. Another key to Synge's analysis was his classification of
the problem into three distinct cases: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic
corresponding, respectively, to the sum of products of pairs of vortex
strengths being positive, negative or zero. The reduction of the vortex
configuration, a curve in space to a planar curve is one-to-one, except along a
critical planar curve C in the parabolic case. Each point on C represents a
triangle of unit perimeter corresponding to a family of similar vortex
configurations, expanding or contracting. The latter would lead to coelescence
of the three vortices. Tavantzis and Ting (1988) filled most of the gaps left
by Synge regarding the dynamics of the problem, and showed in particular that
points on C corresponding to similar expanding families of vortex
configurations are stable while those corresponding to similar contracting
families are unstable. Their investigations yielded an exhaustive description
of the motion and stability of three vortices in a plane except for the global
behavior of the vortex configurations in a narrow strip containing C. The main
contribution of this paper is a complete description of the global dynamics in

the gravitational fragmentation of infalling gas into stellar clusters. The
gravitational potential of a forming stellar cluster provides the focus that
attracts gas from the surrounding molecular cloud. Structures present in the
gas grow, forming filaments flowing into the cluster centre. These filaments
attain high gas densities due to the combination of the cluster potential and
local self-gravity. The resultant Jeans masses are low, allowing the formation
of very low-mass fragments. The tidal shear and high velocity dispersion
present in the cluster preclude any subsequent accretion thus resulting in the
formation of brown dwarfs or very low-mass stars. Ejections are not required as
the brown dwarfs enter the cluster with high relative velocities, suggesting
that their disc and binary properties should be similar to that of low-mass
stars. This mechanism requires the presence of a strong gravitational potential
due to the stellar cluster implying that brown dwarf formation should be more
frequent in stellar clusters than in distributed populations of young stars.
Brown dwarfs formed in isolation would require another formation mechanism such

defined as the systematic noise in the ISW detection that originates in the
realisation of the matter distribution in the observed Universe. We show that
the local variance contributes about 11 per cent to the total variance in the
standard method, if a perfect and complete LSS survey up to z ~ 2 is assumed.
Due to local variance, the estimated detection significance and cosmological
parameter constraints in the standard method are biased. In this work, we
present an optimal method of how to reduce the local variance effect in the ISW
detection by working conditional on the LSS-data. The variance of the optimal
method, and hence the signal-to-noise ratio, depends on the actual realisation
of the matter distribution in the observed Universe. We show that for an ideal
galaxy survey, the average signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced by about 7 per
cent in the optimal method, as compared to the standard method. Furthermore, in
the optimal method there is no need to estimate the covariance matrix by Monte
Carlo simulations as in the standard method, which saves time and increases the
accuracy. Finally, we derive the correct joint likelihood function for
cosmological parameters given CMB- and LSS-data within the linear LSS formation
regime, which includes a small coupling of the two datasets due to the ISW
effect.

years, SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy and SN 2008D. SN 2008D attracted special attention
due to the serendipitous discovery of an associated X-ray transient. In this
paper, we study the properties of NGC 2770 and specifically the three SN sites
to investigate whether this galaxy is in any way peculiar to cause a high
frequency of SNe Ib. We model the global SED of the galaxy from broadband data
and derive a star-formation and SN rate comparable to the values of the Milky
Way. We further study the galaxy using longslit spectroscopy covering the major
axis and the three SN sites. From the spectroscopic study we find subsolar
metallicities for the SN sites, a high extinction and a moderate star-formation
rate. In a high resolution spectrum, we also detect diffuse interstellar bands
in the line-of-sight towards SN 2008. A comparison of NGC 2770 to the global
properties of a galaxy sample with high SN occurance (at least 3 SN in the last
100 years) suggests that NGC 2770 is not particularly destined to produce such
an enhancement of observed SNe observed. Its properties are also very different
from gamma-ray burst host galaxies. Statistical considerations on SN Ib
detection rates give a probability of ~1.5% to find a galaxy with three Ib SNe
detected in 10 years. The high number of rare Ib SNe in this galaxy is
therefore likely to be a coincidence rather than special properties of the
galaxy itself. NGC 2770 has a small irregular companion, NGC 2770B, which is
highly starforming, has a very low mass and one of the lowest metallicities
detected in the nearby universe as derived from longslit spectroscopy. In the
most metal poor part, we even detect Wolf-Rayet features, against the current
models of WR stars which require high metallicities.

languages can be accepted by 2qfa's with one-sided error probabilities within

be described by the superposition of the Weibull distribution and the
log-Weibull distribution. In particular, the distribution of large earthquakes
obeys the Weibull distribution with the exponent $\alpha_1 <1$, indicating the
fact that the sequence of large earthquakes is not a Poisson process. It is
found that the ratio of the Weibull distribution to the probability
distribution of the interoccurrence time gradually increases with increase in
the threshold of magnitude. Our results infer that Weibull statistics and
log-Weibull statistics coexist in the interoccurrence time statistics, and that
the change of the distribution is considered as the change of the dominant

log-Weibull distribution to the Weibull distribution, allowing us to reinforce
the view that the interoccurrence time exhibits the transition from the Weibull

Nanowire Detector (PND), which uses spatial multiplexing on a subwavelength
scale to provide a single electrical output proportional to the photon number.
The basic structure of the PND is the parallel connection of several NbN
superconducting nanowires (100 nm-wide, few nm-thick), folded in a meander
pattern. Electrical and optical equivalents of the device were developed in
order to gain insight on its working principle. PNDs were fabricated on 3-4 nm
thick NbN films grown on sapphire (substrate temperature TS=900C) or MgO
(TS=400C) substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in an Ar/N2 gas mixture.
The device performance was characterized in terms of speed and sensitivity. The
photoresponse shows a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as low as 660ps. PNDs
showed counting performance at 80 MHz repetition rate. Building the histograms
of the photoresponse peak, no multiplication noise buildup is observable and a
one photon quantum efficiency can be estimated to be QE=3% (at 700 nm
wavelength and 4.2 K temperature). The PND significantly outperforms existing
PNR detectors in terms of simplicity, sensitivity, speed, and multiplication
noise.

star by a fixed amount. On the other hand, light curves of transiting
circumbinary (CB) planets are expected to be neither periodic nor to have a
single depth while in transit, making BLS [Kovacs et al. 2002] almost
ineffective. Therefore, a modified version for the identification of CB planets
was developed - CB-BLS. We show that using CB-BLS it is possible to find CB
planets in the residuals of light curves of eclipsing binaries (EBs) that have
noise levels of 1% or more. Using CB-BLS will allow to easily harness the
massive ground- and space- based photometric surveys to look for these objects.
Detecting transiting CB planets is expected to have a wide range of
implications, for e.g.: The frequency of CB planets depend on the planetary
formation mechanism - and planets in close pairs of stars provides a most
restrictive constraint on planet formation models. Furthermore, understanding
very high precision light curves is limited by stellar parameters - and since
for EBs the stellar parameters are much better determined, the resultant
planetary structure models will have significantly smaller error bars, maybe
even small enough to challenge theory.

physical parametrisation of the young stellar population in L1615/L1616. We
identified 25 new T Tauri stars mainly projected on the dense head of the
cometary cloud, almost doubling the current number of known members. We studied
the spatial distribution of the cloud members as a function of the age and
H$\alpha$ emission. The star formation efficiency in the cloud is about 7-8 %,
as expected for molecular clouds in the vicinity of OB associations. The slope
of the initial mass function (IMF), in the mass range 0.1<M<5.5 $M_{\odot}$, is
consistent with that of other T and OB associations, providing further support
of an universal IMF down to the hydrogen burning limit, regardless of
environmental conditions. The cometary appearance, as well as the high star
formation efficiency, can be explained in terms of triggered star formation
induced by the strong UV radiation from OB stars or supernovae shockwaves. The
age spread as well as both the spatial and age distribution of the PMS objects
provide strong evidence of sequential, multiple events and possibly still
ongoing star formation activity in the cloud.

cycle of the primary pulsation period (P_0=1/f_0), making possible a very
rigorous and complete analysis. The modulation period is found to be 16.5462 d,
which is about half of that was reported earlier from visual observations.
Previously unknown features of the modulation have been detected. Besides the
main modulation frequency f_m, sidelobe modulation frequencies around the
pulsation frequency and its harmonics appear at +/- 2 f_m, +/- 4 f_m, and +/-
12.5 f_m separations as well. Residual signals in the prewhitened light curve
larger than the observational noise appear at the minimum-rising branch-maximum
phase of the pulsation, which most probably arise from some stochastic/chaotic
behaviour of the pulsation/modulation. The Fourier parameters of the mean light
curve differ significantly from the averages of the Fourier parameters of the
observed light curves in the different phases of the Blazhko cycle.
Consequently, the mean light curve of MW Lyrae never matches its actual light
variation. The Phi_21, Phi_31 phase differences in different phases of the
modulation show unexpected stability during the Blazhko cycle. A new
phenomenological description of the light curve variation is defined that
separates the amplitude and phase (period) modulations utilising the phase
coherency of the lower order Fourier phases.

length, making it a promising probe of the nature of dark energy. The detection
of BAO requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. ""Transversal""
(angular distance) BAO measure the angular size of this scale, while
""line-of-sight"" (or ""radial"") BAO require precise redshifts, but provide a
direct measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more
sensitive probe of dark energy. The main goal of this paper is to show that a
precision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure BAO in the radial
direction. This precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using a
filter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 A, from ~
4000 A to ~ 8000 A, supplemented by two broad-band filters. We describe a
practical implementation, a new galaxy survey, PAU, to be carried out with a
telescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering
8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. We expect to measure positions and
redshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with L > L* and i_AB <
22.5 in the interval 0.1 < z < 0.9, with sigma_z < 0.003(1 + z). This
population has a number density n > 10^-3 Mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (Gpc/h)^3
volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the BAO
scale is not limited by shot-noise. By itself, such a survey will deliver
precisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, if
assumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined with
future CMB measurements. In addition, PAU will yield high-quality redshift and
low-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

frequency spectrums can induce asymptotical decoherence, while, some other

is studied within a generalized factorization scheme taking into account the
transverse momentum of the partons in the initial hadrons. Within this scheme
an anomalously large cos(2\phi) asymmetry observed in the Drell-Yan process
could be attributed to the T-odd, spin and transverse momentum dependent parton
distribution function h_1^{\perp q}(x, p_{\perp}^2). The same function is
expected to produce a cos(2\phi) asymmetry in the photon-jet production cross
section. This particular azimuthal asymmetry is estimated to be smaller than
the Drell-Yan asymmetry but still of considerable size for Tevatron kinematics,
offering a new possibility to study T-odd effects at the Tevatron.

the single-component Lennard-Jones system. We demonstrate that the potential
may be replaced, at fixed volume, by an effective power-law, but not because
only short distance encounters dominate the fluctuations. Indeed, contributions
to the fluctuations are associated with the whole first peak of the RDF, as we
demonstrate by an analysis of the spatially resolved covariance matrix. The
reason the effective power-law works so well depends on going beyond
single-pair effects and on the constraint of fixed volume. In particular, a
better approximation to the potential includes a linear term, which contributes
to the mean values of potential energy and virial, but not to their
fluctuations. We also study the T=0 limit of the crystalline phase, where the
correlation coefficient becomes very close, but not equal, to unity. We then
consider four consequences of strong pressure-energy correlations: (1)
analyzing experimental data for supercritical Ar we find 96% correlation; (2)
we discuss the significance acquired by the correlations for viscous van der
Waals liquids approaching the glass transition: For strongly correlating
viscous liquids knowledge of just one of the eight frequency-dependent
thermoviscoelastic response functions basically implies knowledge of them all;
(3) we re-interpret aging simulations of ortho-terphenyl carried out by Mossa

less than 0.3%. From the individually estimated spectroscopic distances of
about $38^{+10}_{-7}$ pc and $72^{+21}_{-16}$ pc, respectively for the M7 dwarf

proper motions we assume a common distance of about 50 pc and a projected
physical separation of about 5 pc. The mean heliocentric space velocity of the
pair $(U,V,W)=(-232, -170, +74)$ km/s, based on the correctness of the
preliminary radial velocity measurement for only one of the components and on
the assumption of a common distance and velocity vector, is typical of the
Galactic halo population. The large separation and the different metallicities
of dwarfs and subdwarfs make a common formation scenario as a wide binary

spectroscopic classification scheme of ultracool dwarfs/subdwarfs so that a
dissolved binary origin cannot be fully ruled out yet. It seems more likely
that this wide pair is part of an old halo stream. (...)

regime. The tunneling between the electrode and the molecule is asymmetrically
modulated by the oscillations of the molecule, i.e., if the molecule gets
closer to one of the electrodes the tunneling to that electrode will increase
while for the other electrode it will decrease. The system is described by a
two-channel Anderson model with phonon-assisted hybridization, which is solved
with the Wilson numerical renormalization group method. The results for several
functional forms of tunneling modulation are presented. For a linearized
modulation the Kondo screening of the molecular spin is caused by the even or
odd conduction channel. At the critical value of the electron-phonon coupling
an unstable two-channel Kondo fixed point is found. For a realistic modulation
the spin at the molecular orbital is Kondo screened by the even conduction
channel even in the regime of strong coupling. A universal consequence of the
electron-phonon coupling is the softening of the phonon mode and the related
instability to perturbations that break the left-right symmetry. When the
frequency of oscillations decreases below the magnitude of such perturbation,
the molecule is abruptly attracted to one of the electrodes. In this regime,
the Kondo temperature is enhanced and, simultaneously, the conductance through

matrices in a curved spacetime by extending Pauli's method. We further extend
this study to three versions of the Dirac equation: the standard
(Dirac-Fock-Weyl or DFW) equation, and two alternative versions, both of which
are based on the recently proposed linear tensor representations of the Dirac
field (TRD). We begin with the current conservation: we show that the latter
applies to any solution of the Dirac equation, iff the field of Dirac matrices
$\gamma ^\mu $ satisfies a specific PDE. This equation is always satisfied for
DFW with its restricted choice for the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices. It similarly
restricts the choice of the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices for TRD. However, this
restriction can be achieved. The frame dependence of a general Hamiltonian
operator is studied. We show that in any given reference frame with minor
restrictions on the spacetime metric, the axioms of quantum mechanics impose a
unique form for the Hilbert space scalar product. Finally, the condition for
the general Dirac Hamiltonian operator to be Hermitian is derived in a general
curved spacetime. For DFW, the validity of this hermiticity condition depends
on the choice of the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices.

generalized random phase approximation (GRPA) and has a gapped and parabolic

is released during the Raman transition. The scattering rate is determined
versus the transition frequency $\omega$ and the transferred momentum $\vc{q}$
and shows the corresponding resonance around this gap. Nevertheless, the Raman
scattering process is attenuated by the superfluid part of the gas. The
macroscopic wave function of the condensate deforms its shape in order to
screen locally the external potential displayed by the Raman light beams. This
screening is total for a condensed atom transition in order to prevent the

metallicity, bringing heavy mass loss where almost none was expected. Is this
still true when the metallicity strictly equals zero? The aim of our study is
to get an answer to this question, and to determine how rotation changes the
evolution and the chemical signature of the primordial stars. We have
calculated 14 differentially-rotating and non-rotating stellar models at zero
metallicity, with masses between 9 and 200 Msol. The evolution has been
followed up to the pre-supernova stage. We find that Z=0 models rotate with an
internal profile Omega(r) close to local angular momentum conservation, because
of a very weak core-envelope coupling. Rotational mixing drives a H-shell boost
due to a sudden onset of CNO cycle in the shell. This boost leads to a high 14N
production. Generally, the rotating models produce much more metals than their
non-rotating counterparts. The mass loss is very low, even for the models that
reach the critical velocity during the main sequence. Due to the low mass loss
and the weak coupling, the core retains a high angular momentum at the end of
the evolution. The high rotation rate at death probably leads to a much
stronger explosion than previously expected, changing the fate of the models.
The inclusion of our yields in a chemical evolution model of the Galactic halo
predicts log values of N/O, C/O and 12C/13C ratios of -2.2, -0.95 and 50
respectively at log O/H +12 = 4.2.

comissioned WASA-at-COSY facility is the study of fundamental symmetries via
the measurements of the eta and eta-prime mesons decays. Especially interesting
are isospin violating hadronic precesses of these mesons into 3pi systems
driven by the term of QCD Lagrangian which depends on the mass difference of
the u and d quarks. When an eta or an eta-prime meson is created in the
hadronic reaction signals from such decays may be significantly obscured by the
prompt production of pi mesons. In this thesis we present the estimation of the
upper limit of the background due to prompt pion production for the eta-prime
->3pi0 and eta-prime->pi+pi-pi decays. Using the data from proton-proton
collisions measured by the COSY-11 group we have extracted differential cross
sections for the multimeson production with the invariant mass corresponding to
the mass of the eta-prime meson. Based on these results and on parametrizations
of the total cross sections for the eta-prime meson as well as parametrization
of the upper limit for the prompt pi+pi-pi0 production in the collisions of
protons we discuss in details the feasibility of a measurement of the eta-prime
meson decay into 3pi channels with the WASA-at-COSY facility. Based on the
chiral unitary approach the value of the branching ratio
BR(eta-prime->pi+pi-pi0) was recently predicted to be about 1%. We show that
the WASA-at-COSY has a potential to verify this result empirically.

regime, results for $\Lambda > 1$ show several improvements over the undamped,
$\Lambda=1$ case: perfect conductance is obtained deeper in the strongly
interacting regime and current plateaus remain well defined for longer time
scales. Similar improvements were obtained in the finite-bias regime up to bias
voltages of the order of the Kondo temperature. These results show that, with
the proposed modification, the tDMRG characterization of Kondo correlations in
the transport properties can be substantially improved, while it turns out to
be sufficient to work with much smaller system sizes. We discuss the numerical
cost of this approach with respect to the necessary system sizes and the
entanglement growth during the time-evolution.

allows an on/off switching of superconductivity and drives a quantum phase
