graceful exit without recourse to flat potentials or super-Planckian field
values. Though bubbles of true vacuum are too sparse to uniformly reheat the
Universe by colliding with each other, a compact dimension enables a single
bubble to uniformly reheat by colliding with itself. This mechanism, which
generates an approximately scale invariant perturbation spectrum, requires that
inflation be driven by a bulk field, that vacuum decay be slow, and that the
extra dimension be at least a hundred times larger than the false vacuum Hubble
length.

adding edges to make the even-indexed vertices pairwise adjacent. Suns play an
important role in the study of strongly chordal graphs. A graph is chordal if
it does not contain an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is
strongly chordal if it is chordal and every even cycle has a chord joining
vertices whose distance on the cycle is odd. Farber proved that a graph is
strongly chordal if and only if it is chordal and contains no induced suns.
There are well known polynomial-time algorithms for recognizing a sun in a
chordal graph. Recently, polynomial-time algorithms for finding a sun for a
larger class of graphs, the so-called HHD-free graphs, have been discovered. In
this paper, we prove the problem of deciding whether an arbitrary graph

irreducible polynomials $f$ of the form $f(x)=x^m-f_0$, and is well-understood.
The other class (type II) can be obtained from a primitive element in some
subfield by a process that we call extension and lifting. We will use the known
classification of the subgroups of $\PGL(2,q)$ in combination with a recent
result by Brison and Nogueira to show that a nonstandard element of degree two

application of an electric field to conductors heats electric charge carriers.
Often an elevated electron temperature describes the result of the heating.
This paper demonstrates that an electric field applied to a conductor with
discrete electron spectrum produces a non-equilibrium electron distribution,
which cannot be described by temperature. Such electron distribution changes
dramatically the conductivity of highly mobile two dimensional electrons in a
magnetic field, forcing them into a state with a zero differential resistance.
Most importantly the results demonstrate that, in general, the effective

planetesimal populations that have accreted at early epochs and survived
possible planet formation processes. While debris disks must contain solids in
a broad range of sizes - from big planetesimals down to tiny dust grains -
debris disk observations are only sensitive to the dust end of the size
distribution. Collisional models of debris disks are needed to ""climb up"" the
ladder of the collisional cascade, from dust towards parent bodies,
representing the main mass reservoir of the disks. We have used our collisional
code to generate five disks around a sun-like star, assuming planetesimal belts
at 3, 10, 30, 100, and 200 AU with 10 times the Edgeworth-Kuiper-belt mass
density, and to evolve them for 10 Gyr. Along with an appropriate scaling rule,
this effectively yields a three-parametric set of reference disks (initial
mass, location of planetesimal belt, age). For all the disks, we have generated
spectral energy distributions (SEDs), assuming homogeneous spherical
astrosilicate dust grains. A comparison between generated and actually observed
SEDs yields estimates of planetesimal properties (location, total mass etc.).
As a test and a first application of this approach, we have selected five disks
around sun-like stars with well-known SEDs. In four cases, we have reproduced
the data with a linear combination of two disks from the grid (an ""asteroid
belt"" at 3 AU and an outer ""Kuiper belt""); in one case a single, outer
component was sufficient. The outer components are compatible with ""large
Kuiper belts"" of 0.2-50 earth masses (in the bodies up to 100 km in size) with

Wolf-Rayet (WR) X-ray binary, and NGC300 X-1 is thought to be. IC10 X-1 and
NGC300 X-1 have similar X-ray properties, with luminosities ~10^38 erg/s, and
orbital periods ~30 hr. We investigate similarities between these two, as well
as differences between them and the known Galactic BH binary systems. We have
examined XMM-Newton observations of NGC300 X-1 and IC10 X-1. We extracted
lightcurves and spectra; power density spectra (PDS) were constructed from the
lightcurves, and the X-ray emission spectra were modeled. Each source exhibits
PDS that are characteristic of disc-accreting X-ray binaries (XBs) in the high
state. In this state, Galactic XBs with known BH primaries have soft, thermal
emission; however the emission spectra of our targets are predominantly
non-thermal. Furthermore, the Observation 1 spectrum of NGC300 X-1 is
strikingly similar to that of IC10 X-1. The remarkable similarity between the
behaviour of NGC300 X-1 in Observation 1 and that of IC10 X-1 lends strong
evidence for NGC300 X-1 being a (BH+WR) binary. The unusual spectra of NGC300
X-1 and IC10 X-1 may be due to these systems existing in a persistently high
state, whereas all known BH LMXBs are transient. BH XBs in a persistent high
state could retain their corona, and hence exhibit a large non-thermal
component. LMC X-1 is a BH XB that has only been observed in the high state,
and its spectrum is remarkably similar to those of our targets. We therefore
classify NGC300 X-1, IC10 X-1 and perhaps LMC X-1 as a new breed of BH XB,
defined by their persistently high accretion rates and consequent stable disc
configuration and corona. This scenario may also explain the lack of
ultraluminous X-ray sources in the canonical soft state.

(determination of bounds, sums of disjoint products algorithms, Monte Carlo

approximations when the network's size increases, even when nodes do not fail
and all edges have the same reliability p. We consider here a directed, generic
graph of arbitrary size mimicking real-life long-haul communication networks,
and give the exact, analytical solution for the two-terminal reliability. This
solution involves a product of transfer matrices, in which individual
reliabilities of edges and nodes are taken into account. The special case of
identical edge and node reliabilities (p and rho, respectively) is addressed.
We consider a case study based on a commonly-used configuration, and assess the
influence of the edges being directed (or not) on various measures of network
performance. While the two-terminal reliability, the failure frequency and the
failure rate of the connection are quite similar, the locations of complex
zeros of the two-terminal reliability polynomials exhibit strong differences,
and various structure transitions at specific values of rho. The present work
could be extended to provide a catalog of exactly solvable networks in terms of
reliability, which could be useful as building blocks for new and improved
bounds, as well as benchmarks, in the general case.

the spectrum of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field consists of
infinitely degenerate Landau levels. Just as for the $1/r$ and $r^2$

infinite-dimensional representations. Indeed, the position of the center of the
cyclotron circle plays the role of a Runge-Lenz vector. After identifying the
corresponding accidental symmetry algebra, we re-analyze the system in a finite
periodic volume. Interestingly, similar to the quantum mechanical breaking of
CP invariance due to the $\theta$-vacuum angle in non-Abelian gauge theories,
quantum effects due to two self-adjoint extension parameters $\theta_x$ and
$\theta_y$ explicitly break the continuous translation invariance of the

is flexible enough to extract all MC required data from DICOM files, and write
MC produced dose distributions into DICOM files that can then be processed in a
treatment planning system environment. The library can be made available upon

and to stellar and baryonic quantities. For our compiled sample of 76 normal,
non-interacting high and low surface brightness galaxies, we find some changes,
which evidence evolution effects, mainly related to gas infall and star
formation (SF). We also explore correlations among the (B-K) color, stellar
mass fraction fs, mass M (luminosity L), and surface density (SB), as well as
correlations among the residuals of the scaling relations. Some of our findings
are: (i) the scale length Rb is a third parameter in the baryonic TF relation
and the residuals of this relation follow a trend (slope ~-0.15) with the
residuals of the Rb-Mb relation; for the stellar and K band cases, R is not
anymore a third parameter and the mentioned trend disappears; (ii) among the
TFRs, the B-band TFR is the most scattered; in this case, the color is a third
parameter; (iii) the LSB galaxies break some observed trends, which suggest a
threshold in the gas surface density Sg, below which the SF becomes independent
of the gas infall rate and Sg. Our results are interpreted and discussed in the
light of LCDM-based models of galaxy evolution. The models explain not only the
baryonic scaling relations, but also most of the processes responsible for the
observed changes in the slopes, scatters, and correlations among the residuals
when changing to stellar and luminous quantities. The baryon fraction is
required to be smaller than 0.05 on average. We detect some potential
difficulties for the models: the observed color-M and surface density-M
correlations are steeper, and the intrinsic scatter in the baryonic TFR is
smaller than those predicted. [abridged]

Cyclotron with a bombardment time short compared to the reported modulation
period. Isotope selection by the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator is followed by
implantation and a long period of monitoring the $^{142}$Nd K$_{\alpha}$ x-rays
from the daughter. The decay time spectrum of the x-rays is well-described by a
simple exponential and the measured half-life of 40.68(53) seconds is
consistent with the accepted value. We observed no oscillatory modulation at
the proposed frequency at a level 31 times smaller than that reported by
Litvinov {\it et al.} (Phys. Lett. B 664 (2008) 162; arXiv:0801.2079

cometary oxygen lines from the telluric oxygen lines and from other cometary
emissions. We find that the relative intensities of the two red lines (6300.304

If we assume the relative excitation rates of potential parents which have
appeared in the literature, then H2O would be the parent of the cometary green
oxygen line. However, those rates have been questioned. We measured the width
of the three oxygen lines and find that the green line is wider than either of

capacity makes major US airports very sensitive to uncertainties. Consequently,
airport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway
queues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations
from the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield
significant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a
Collaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during
congested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive
environment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated
using current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual
Queue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases
wheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute
intra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for
airlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight
sequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off
between minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level
of unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines
could choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by
prioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is
congested.

entanglement in order to offer any speed up over a classical computer. However,
deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit (DQC1), which employs
noisy (mixed) states, is an efficient model that generates at most a marginal
amount of entanglement. Although this model cannot implement any arbitrary
algorithm it can efficiently solve a range of problems of significant
importance to the scientific community. Here we experimentally implement a
first-order case of a key DQC1 algorithm and explicitly characterise the
non-classical correlations generated. Our results show that while there is no
entanglement the algorithm does give rise to other non-classical correlations,
which we quantify using the quantum discord - a stronger measure of
non-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Our results
suggest that discord could replace entanglement as a necessary resource for a
quantum computational speed-up. Furthermore, DQC1 is far less resource
intensive than universal quantum computing and our implementation in a scalable

gradually increasing the Rashba parameter from zero, Fano resonances in strong
overlap regime continuously evolve to resolve antiresonances. This transition
is ascribed to the phase shift of couplings between molecular states and the
lead due to spin precession. We also show that both bias and Rashba effect
strengthen the induced spin polarization in this device. For particular energy

orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity. This effect is only relevant for
planets orbiting very close to their host stars. The habitable zones of
low-mass stars are also close-in and tides can alter the orbits of planets in
these locations. We calculate the tidal evolution of hypothetical terrestrial
planets around low-mass stars and show that tides can evolve planets past the
inner edge of the habitable zone, sometimes in less than 1 billion years. This
migration requires large eccentricities (>0.5) and low-mass stars (<0.35
M_Sun). Such migration may have important implications for the evolution of the
atmosphere, internal heating and the Gaia hypothesis. Similarly, a planet
detected interior to the habitable zone could have been habitable in the past.
We consider the past habitability of the recently-discovered, ~5 M_Earth
planet, Gliese 581 c. We find that it could have been habitable for reasonable
choices of orbital and physical properties as recently as 2 Gyr ago. However,
when we include constraints derived from the additional companions, we see that
most parameter choices that predict past habitability require the two inner
planets of the system to have crossed their mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance.
As this crossing would likely have resulted in resonance capture, which is not
observed, we conclude that Gl 581 c was probably never habitable.

criterion for the strato-rotational instability (in short SRI) occurring in a
Taylor-Couette system. The control parameters of the problem are the rotation
ratio $\mu$ and the radius ratio $\eta$. The study is motivated by recent
experimental \cite{legal} and numerical \cite{rudi, rudi2} results reporting
the existence of unstable modes beyond the Rayleigh line for centrifugal
instability ($\mu =\eta^2$). The modified Rayleigh criterion for stably
stratified flows provides the instability condition, $\mu<1$, while in
experiments unstable modes were never found beyond the line $\mu=\eta$. Taking
into account finite gap effects, we consider non axisymmetric perturbations
with azimuthal wavenumber $l$ in the limit $l Fr<<1$, where $Fr$ is the Froude
number. We derive a necessary condition for instability : $\mu < \mu^*$ where
$\mu^*$, a function of $\eta$, takes the asymptotic values, $\mu^* \to 1$ in
the narrow gap limit, and $\mu^* \to 2\eta^2(1+\eta)$ in the wide gap limit, in
agreement with recent numerical findings. A stronger condition, $\mu<\eta$, is
found when $\eta>0.38$, in agreement with experimental results obtained for
$\eta=0.8$. Whatever the gap size, instability is predicted for values of $\mu$
larger than the critical one, $\mu_c=\eta^2$, corresponding to centrifugal
instability.

protostellar assembly out of a non-turbulent core, the mass accretion reaches
20 - 100 c^3/G. Furthermore, we explore the self-consistent structure of
bipolar outflows that are produced in our three dimensional magnetized collapse
simulations. These outflows produce cavities out of which radiation pressure
can be released, thereby reducing the limitations on the final mass of massive
stars formed by gravitational collapse.
  Additional enhancement of the mass accretion rate comes from accretion along
filaments that are built up by supersonic turbulent motions. Our numerical

act like additional effective graviton mass, suppressing gravitational waves
creation. However, this effects can be treated perturbatively. We investigate
the simplified model without these corrections and find its exact analytical
solution. For this model we calculate a spectrum of the gravitational waves
from the Big Bounce phase. The obtained spectrum decreases to zero for the low
energy modes. Based on this observation we indicate that this effect can lead
to the low CMB multipoles suppression and gives a potential way to test Loop
Quantum Cosmology models. We also consider a scenario with a post-bounce
inflationary phase. The obtained power spectrum gives qualitative explanation
of the CMB spectra, including low multipoles suppression. This result is a
challenge to construct a consistent bounce+inflation model in the Loop Quantum

techniques to assess the divergence between full-data and case-deleted

the dependability of the importance sampling estimators depends critically on
the variability of the case-deleted weights. We provide theoretical results
concerning the assessment of the dependability of case-deleted importance

the assessment of the dependability of the estimators can be verified routinely

asymptotically as O(- I^0.5) for small I and as O(+- I) for large I. The former
regime is dominated by the electrostatic potential due to an unequal
partitioning of ions between the two liquids whereas the latter regime is
related to a finite interfacial thickness. The crossover between the two
asymptotic regimes depends sensitively on material parameters suggesting that,
depending on the actual system under investigation, the experimentally
accessible range of ionic strengths can correspond to either the small or the
large ionic strength regime. In the limiting case of a liquid-gas surface where
ion partitioning is absent, the image chage interaction can dominate the
surface tension for small ionic strength I such that an Onsager-Samaras

produced by a superimposed absorption component from the companion. High

difference of about 541 km/s. From this difference, we infer quite high values
of the minimum masses, of about 87Mo and 53Mo for the primary and secondary

CdTe pixels, sensitive from 4 to 300 keV, with imaging capabilities up to about
120 keV and a localization accuracy better than 10 arcmin. The CXG permanently
observes a 2 sr-wide field of the sky and provides photon data to the onboard
science and triggering unit (UTS) which detects GRB by count-rate increases or
by the appearance of a new source in cyclic sky images. The SXT is a mirror

magnetograms of BP Tau and V2129 Oph have shown, however, that their fields are
more complex. The magnetic field of V2129 Oph was found to be predominantly
octupolar. For BP Tau the magnetic energy was shared mainly between the dipole

times as strong as that of V2129 Oph. From the published surface maps of the

and compare the resulting field structures with that of a dipole. We consider
different models where the disc is truncated at, or well-within, the Keplerian
corotation radius. We find that although the structure of the surface magnetic
field is particularly complex for both stars, the geometry of the larger scale
field, along which accretion is occurring, is somewhat simpler. However, the
larger scale field is distorted close to the star by the stronger field
regions, with the net effect being that the fractional open flux through the
stellar surface is less than would be expected with a dipole magnetic field
model. Finally, we estimate the disc truncation radius, assuming that this
occurs where the magnetic torque from the stellar magnetosphere is comparable
to the viscous torque in the disc.

considering the effects of an external applied bias, which breaks the

the resulting induced Rashba couplings within each subband. Interestingly, we
find that for double wells the Rashba couplings for the first and second

a recently introduced random unitary circuit ensemble towards their limits
given by the circular unitary ensemble (CUE). Our study includes the full
distribution of the absolute square of a matrix element, moments of that
distribution up to order eight, as well as correlators containing up to 16
matrix elements in a given column of the unitary matrices. Our numerical
scaling analysis shows that all of these quantities can be reproduced
efficiently, with a number of random gates which scales at most as $n_q\log
(n_q/\epsilon)$ with the number of qubits $n_q$ for a given fixed precision
$\epsilon$. This suggests that quantities which require an exponentially large
number of gates are of more complex nature.

of this new algorithm are studied. Furthermore, the results are applied to the
minimization of Tikhonov-functionals associated with linear inverse problems

Bregman-Taylor-distance estimates, rates of convergence for the
forward-backward splitting procedure are obtained. Examples which demonstrate
the applicability are given, in particular, a generalization of the iterative

protein. Scaffold proteins assemble multiple proteins in a spatially localized
signaling complex and exert numerous physical effects on signaling pathways. To
study these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of
scaffold mediated kinase activation. We first introduce and apply a path
summation technique to obtain approximate solutions to a single molecule master
equation that governs protein kinase activation. We then consider exact
numerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and
then use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at
many time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold
protein. The findings are consistent with recent experiments and simulation
data. Our results provide a framework and offer a mechanism for understanding
how scaffold proteins can influence the shape of the waiting time distribution
of kinase activation and effectively broaden the times over which protein
kinases are activated in the course of cell signaling.

distributed over a wide range of redshifts. The XRB carries information on the
spatial distribution and evolution of these sources. The goals of the paper
are: 1. to determine the redshift distribution of the soft X-ray background
photons produced by all types of extragalactic sources, in order to relate
fluctuations of the background to the large scale structures, 2. to determine
the redshift distribution of the soft XRB produced by AGN in order to calculate
the evolution of the AGN X-ray luminosity density. A set of major X-ray surveys
is used to determine the redshift distributions of the X-ray sources selected
at various flux levels. Simple analytic fits to the data allow us to determine
the smooth relationship between the redshift distribution and the source flux.
The redshift distribution of the integral XRB flux is obtained by averaging the
fits over the source counts. It is shown that the distribution of extragalactic
XRB photons in the 0.5-2 keV band is adequately represented by the function:
dn/dlog z = 5.24 z^1.52 exp(-z/0.63). The huge voids postulated to explain the
cold spots in the CMB maps create dips in the total XRB flux. However, the
expected magnitude of the effect is comparable to the fluctuation amplitude of
the XRB generated by the individual sources contributing to the background. The
cosmic evolution of the AGN X-ray luminosity density up to redshift of ~5 is
calculated in an elegant and straightforward way. Systematic uncertainties of
the present method are assessed and shown to be small. At redshift greater than
one the present results could be compared directly with some recent estimates
obtained in a standard way and the agreement between both methods is very good.

locating its mean point and finding the dispersion about that point. On a
general manifold however, even if two distributions are sufficiently
concentrated and have unique means, a comparison of their covariances is not
possible due to the difference in local parametrizations. To circumvent the
problem we associate a covariance field with each distribution and compare them
at common points by applying a similarity invariant function on their
representing matrices. In this way we are able to define distances between
distributions. We also propose new approach for interpolating discrete
distributions and derive some criteria that assure consistent results. Finally,
we illustrate with some experimental results on the unit 2-sphere.

temperatures. These two heavy fermion compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic
long-range order, but a strong competition between the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida(RKKY) interaction and Kondo effect is evidenced
by their nearly equal N\'eel and Kondo temperatures. Our aim is to show how
magnons such as measured in the antiferromagnetic phase of these Ce compounds,
can be described with a microscopic Heisenberg-Kondo model introduced by
J.R.Iglesias, C.Lacroix and B.Coqblin, used before for studies of the
non-magnetic phase. The model includes the correlated Ce-$4 f$ electrons
hybridized with the conduction band, where we also allow for correlations, and
we consider competing
  RKKY (Heisenberg-like $J_{H} $) and Kondo ($J_{K}$) antiferromagnetic
couplings. Carrying on a series of unitary transformations, we perturbatively
derive a second-order effective Hamiltonian which, projected onto the
antiferromagnetic electron ground state, describes the spin wave excitations,
renormalized by their interaction with correlated itinerant electrons. We
numerically study how the different parameters of the model influence the
renormalization of the magnons, yielding useful information for the analysis of
inelastic neutron scattering experiments in antiferromagnetic heavy fermion
compounds. We also compare our results with the available experimental data,
finding good agreement with the spin wave measurements in cubic CeIn$_3$.
