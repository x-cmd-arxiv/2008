accreting neutron stars strongly indicate the oscillatory modes in the
innermost regions of accretion disks as a likely source of the QPOs. The inner
regions of accretion disks around neutron stars can harbor very high frequency
modes related to the radial epicyclic frequency $\kappa $. The degeneracy of
$\kappa $ with the orbital frequency $\Omega $ is removed in a non-Keplerian
boundary or transition zone near the magnetopause between the disk and the
compact object. We show, by analyzing the global hydrodynamic modes of long
wavelength in the boundary layers of viscous accretion disks, that the fastest
growing mode frequencies are associated with frequency bands around $\kappa $
and $\kappa \pm \Omega $. The maximum growth rates are achieved near the radius
where the orbital frequency $\Omega $ is maximum. The global hydrodynamic
parameters such as the surface density profile and the radial drift velocity
determine which modes of free oscillations will grow at a given particular
radius in the boundary layer. In accordance with the peak separation between
kHz QPOs observed in neutron-star sources, the difference frequency between two
consecutive bands of the fastest growing modes is always related to the spin
frequency of the neutron star. This is a natural outcome of the boundary
condition imposed by the rotating magnetosphere on the boundary region of the
inner disk.

insights into the creation and propagation of high-energy protons within galaxy

the GLAST satellite) and neutrinos (via the ICECUBE and Auger experiments) from
the Coma cluster of galaxies, as well as for the gamma-ray bright clusters
Abell 85, 1758, and 1914. These three were selected from their possible
association with unidentified EGRET sources, so it is not yet entirely certain
that their gamma-rays are indeed produced diffusively within the intracluster
medium, as opposed to AGNs. It is not obvious why these inconspicuous
Abell-clusters should be the first to be seen in gamma-rays, but a possible
reason is that all of them show direct evidence of recent or ongoing mergers.
Their identification with the EGRET gamma-ray sources is also supported by the
close correlation between their radio and (purported) gamma-ray fluxes. Under
favorable conditions (including a proton spectral index of 2.5 in the case of
Abell 85, and sim 2.3 for Coma, and Abell 1758 and 1914), we expect ICECUBE to

Changing Neutral Current(FCNC) processes that must have sufficient flavor
suppression to be consistent with experiments, if the new physics (NP) is
associated with a scale of a TeV. Here we present a mechanism for suppressing
the NP effects to FCNC processes. We consider the possibility that the source
of NP contributions to FCNC processes share the same flavor symmetry underlying
the SM source of FCNC processes which are the quark and lepton mass matrices.
We call this the principle of shared flavor symmetry. In the flavor symmetric
limit, the quark and lepton mixing matrices have fixed forms and there are no
NP FCNC processes. In the flavor symmetric limit, we take the quark mixing
matrix to be the identity matrix and the lepton mixing matrix to be given by
tri-bimaximal mixing. Realistic mixing matrices are obtained by the small
breaking of the flavor symmetry. New contributions to FCNC processes arise
because of non universal breaking of the flavor symmetry in the quark and
lepton mass matrices and the NP sources of FCNC processes. In particular, we
will focus on new FCNC effects that arise due to the breaking of flavor
symmetry only in the quark and charged lepton mass matrices but not in the NP
sector. In this scenario, NP contributions to FCNC processes is linked to the
source of flavor symmetry breaking in the quark and charged lepton mass
matrices. To demonstrate the mechanism we use a two higgs doublet model as an
example of beyond the SM physics though one should be able to adapt this
mechanism to other models of new physics.

parties holding similar random variables W, W' to agree on a secret key R in

Dodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P,
which can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the
other. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in
time (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an
additional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the
adversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors
secure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.
  We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts
a shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and

of them follow the rules of totally asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) and
in another one move as in symmetric simple exclusion processes (SSEP) is
investigated theoretically. Particles interact with each other via hard-core
exclusion potential, and in the asymmetric channel they can only hop in one
direction, while on the symmetric lattice particles jump in both directions
with equal probabilities. Inter-channel transitions are also allowed at every
site of both lattices. Stationary state properties of the system are solved
exactly in the limit of strong couplings between the channels. It is shown that
strong symmetric couplings between totally asymmetric and symmetric channels
lead to an effective partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP) and
properties of both channels become almost identical. However, strong asymmetric
couplings between symmetric and asymmetric channels yield an effective TASEP
with nonzero particle flux in the asymmetric channel and zero flux on the
symmetric lattice. For intermediate strength of couplings between the lattices
a vertical cluster mean-field method is developed. This approximate approach
treats exactly particle dynamics during the vertical transitions between the
channels and it neglects the correlations along the channels. Our calculations
show that in all cases there are three stationary phases defined by particle
dynamics at entrances, at exits or in the bulk of the system, while phase
boundaries depend on the strength and symmetry of couplings between the
channels. Extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations strongly support our
theoretical predictions.

class, due to Fukaya-Ono and Li-Tian, to compare the virtual fundamental
classes of stable maps to a symplectic manifold and a symplectic submanifold
whenever all constrained stable maps to the former are contained in the latter
to first order. This extends versions of a statement well-known in the
algebraic category to the symplectic category, where it appears to be less
familiar. The latter's inherent flexibility then leads to a confirmation of
Pandharipande's Gopakumar-Vafa prediction for GW-invariants of Fano classes in
6-dimensional symplectic manifolds. In a forthcoming paper, we use a similar
approach to relative Gromov-Witten invariants and the absolute/relative

simulate a Newton black film and in this paper we extend our investigation to
bilayers of the biological membrane type. The electrostatic interactions are
calculated using Ewald sums and, for the macroscopic long range electrostatic
interactions, we use our previously proposed coarsed fit of the (perpendicular
to the bilayer plane) molecular charge distributions with gaussian
distributions. To study an unique biological membrane (not an stack of
bilayers), we propose a simple effective external potential that takes into
account the microscopic pair distribution functions of water and is used to
simulate the interaction with the surrounding water. The method of effective
macroscopic and external potentials is extremely simple to implement in
numerical simulations, and the spatial and temporal charge inhomogeneities are
then roughly taken into account. Molecular dynamics simulations of several
models of a single biological membrane, of neutral or charged polar
amphiphilics, with or without water (using the TIP5P intermolecular potential

winds. Accordingly, we have attributed all these elements in stars of low
metallicities ([Fe/H]<-1.5) to low-mass and normal supernovae (SNe) from
progenitors of ~8-11M_sun and ~12-25M_sun, respectively, which leave behind
neutron stars. Using this rule and attributing all Fe production to normal SNe,
we previously developed a phenomenological two-component model, which predicts
that [Sr/Fe]>-0.32 for all metal-poor stars. The high-resolution data now
available on Sr abundances in Galactic halo stars show that there is a great
shortfall of Sr relative to Fe in many stars with [Fe/H]<-3. This is in direct
conflict with the above prediction. The same conflict also exists for two other
CPR elements Y and Zr. The very low abundances of Sr, Y, and Zr observed in
stars with [Fe/H]<-3 thus require a stellar source that cannot be low-mass or
normal SNe. We show that this observation requires a stellar source leaving
behind black holes and that hypernovae (HNe) from progenitors of ~25-50M_sun

with the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. Removal of flux density
contributions from a superimposed \ion{H}{2} region and from compact

with a spectral index ${\alpha}={-0.45 \pm 0.20}$ below the break and
${\alpha}={-0.87 \pm 0.10}$ above it (${S}_\nu \propto{\nu^{\alpha}}$). The
spectral break is more than three times lower in frequency than the lowest
break detected in any other PWN. The break in the spectrum is likely the result
of synchrotron cooling, and DA 495, at an age of $\sim$20,000 yr, may have
evolved from an object similar to the Vela X nebula, with a similarly energetic
pulsar. We find a magnetic field of $\sim$1.3 mG inside the nebula. After
correcting for the resulting high internal rotation measure, the magnetic field
structure is quite simple, resembling the inner part of a dipole field

also present. The dipole field axis, which should be parallel to the spin axis
of the putative pulsar, lies at an angle of ${\sim}50\degr$ east of the North

hypercube $Q_d=\{0,1\}^d$ according to the hard-core distribution with
parameter $\lambda>0$ (that is, the distribution in which each independent set
$I$ is chosen with probability proportional to $\lambda^{|I|}$). We show a
sharp transition around $\lambda=1$ in the appearance of $I$: for $\lambda>1$,
$\min\{|I \cap {\cal E}|, |I \cap {\cal O}|\}=0$ asymptotically almost surely,
where ${\cal E}$ and ${\cal O}$ are the bipartition classes of $Q_d$, whereas
for $\lambda<1$, $\min\{|I \cap {\cal E}|, |I \cap {\cal O}|\}$ is
asymptotically almost surely exponential in $d$. The transition occurs in an
interval whose length is of order $1/d$.
  A key step in the proof is an estimation of $Z_\lambda(Q_d)$, the sum over
independent sets in $Q_d$ with each set $I$ given weight $\lambda^{|I|}$
(a.k.a. the hard-core partition function). We obtain the asymptotics of
$Z_\lambda(Q_d)$ for $\lambda>\sqrt{2}-1$, and nearly matching upper and lower
bounds for $\lambda \leq \sqrt{2}-1$, extending work of Korshunov and
Sapozhenko. These bounds allow us to read off some very specific information
about the structure of an independent set drawn according to the hard-core

  We also derive a long-range influence result. For all fixed $\lambda>0$, if
$I$ is chosen from the independent sets of $Q_d$ according to the hard-core
distribution with parameter $\lambda$, conditioned on a particular $v \in {\cal
E}$ being in $I$, then the probability that another vertex $w$ is in $I$ is
$o(1)$ for $w \in {\cal O}$ but $\Omega(1)$ for $w \in {\cal E}$.

topological effect, and we introduce a new method to calculate the deflection
angle from the Gaussian curvature of the optical metric. As examples, the
Schwarzschild lens, the Plummer sphere and the singular isothermal sphere are
discussed within this framework.

in the envelopes of evolved stars, in dense star-forming regions, in
protoplanetary disks, in comets, on the surfaces of minor planets, and in
meteorites and interplanetary dust particles. This brief overview summarizes
the observational evidence for the types of organics found in these regions,
with emphasis on recent developments. The Stardust sample-return mission
provides the first opportunity to study primitive cometary material with
sophisticated equipment on Earth. Similarities and differences between the
types of compounds in different regions are discussed in the context of the
processes that can modify them. The importance of laboratory astrophysics is
emphasized.

ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor J_1 and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor
J_2 exchange couplings in the presence of magnetic field. We use both numerical
approaches (the density matrix renormalization group method and exact
diagonalization) and effective field-theory approach, and obtain the
ground-state phase diagram for wide parameter range of the coupling ratio
J_1/J_2. The phase diagram is rich and has a variety of phases, including the
vector chiral phase, the nematic phase, and other multipolar phases. In the
vector chiral phase, which appears in relatively weak magnetic field, the
ground state exhibits long-range order (LRO) of vector chirality which
spontaneously breaks a parity symmetry. The nematic phase shows a quasi-LRO of
antiferro-nematic spin correlation, and arises as a result of formation of
two-magnon bound states in high magnetic fields. Similarly, the higher
multipolar phases, such as triatic (p=3) and quartic (p=4) phases, are formed
through binding of p magnons near the saturation fields, showing quasi-LRO of
antiferro-multipolar spin correlations. The multipolar phases cross over to
spin density wave phases as the magnetic field is decreased, before
encountering a phase transition to the vector chiral phase at a lower field.
The implications of our results to quasi-one-dimensional frustrated magnets
(e.g., LiCuVO_4) are discussed.

potential mu, may contain a critical point (mu_E,T_E) whose non-perturbative
nature makes it a natural object of lattice studies. However, the sign problem
prevents the application of standard Monte Carlo techniques at non-zero baryon
density. We have been pursuing an approach free of the sign problem, where the
chemical potential is taken as imaginary and the results are Taylor-expanded in
mu/T about mu=0, then analytically continued to real mu.
  Within this approach we have determined the sensitivity of the critical
chemical potential mu_E to the quark mass, d(\mu_E)^2/dm_q|_{\mu_E=0}. Our
study indicates that the critical point moves to {\em smaller} chemical
potential as the quark mass {\em increases}. This finding, contrary to common
wisdom, implies that the deconfinement crossover, which takes place in QCD at
mu=0 when the temperature is raised, will remain a crossover in the mu-region
where our Taylor expansion can be trusted. If this result, obtained on a coarse
lattice, is confirmed by simulations on finer lattices now in progress, then we
predict that no {\em chiral} critical point will be found for mu_B \lesssim 500
MeV, unless the phase diagram contains additional transitions.

superadiabatic layers of stellar (interior and atmosphere) models contains in
its standard form 4 free parameters. Three parameters are fixed a priori (and
define what we denote as the MLT 'flavour') whereas one (the so-called mixing
length) is calibrated by reproducing observational constraints. The 'classical'
B\""ohm-Vitense flavour is used in all modern MLT-based stellar model
computations and, despite its crude approximations, the resulting $T_{eff}$
scale appears -- perhaps surprisingly -- remarkably realistic, once the mixing
length parameter is calibrated with a solar model. Model atmosphere
computations employ parameter choices different from what is used in stellar
interior modelling, raising the question of whether a single MLT flavour and
mixing length value can be used to compute interiors and atmospheres of stars
of all types. As a first step towards addressing this issue, we study whether
the MLT flavour (the so-called ML2) and mixing length choice that have been
proven adequate to model white dwarf atmospheres, is able to provide, when used
in stellar models, results at least comparable to the use of the 'classical'
B\""ohm-Vitense flavour. We have computed solar models and evolutionary tracks
for both low- and intermediate-mass Population I and II stars, adopting both
solar calibrated B\""ohm-Vitense and ML2 flavours of the MLT in our stellar
evolution code, and state-of-the-art input physics. The two sets of models
provide consistent results, with only minor differences. Both calibrations
reproduce also the $T_{eff}$ of red giants in a sample of Galactic globular
clusters.

of an intrinsic term, which description is still unclear. Considering Casimir
