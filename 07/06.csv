model subjected to spatially correlated additive and multiplicative noise. We
have employed numerical simulations and the analytical augmented-moment method
which is the second-order moment method for local and global variables [H.
Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 67}, 041903 (2003)]. It has been shown that the
synchrony of an ensemble is increased (decreased) by a positive (negative)
spatial correlation in both additive and multiplicative noise. Although the
variability for local fluctuations is almost insensitive to spatial
correlations, that for global fluctuations is increased (decreased) by positive
(negative) correlations. When a pulse input is applied, the synchrony is
increased for the correlated multiplicative noise, whereas it may be decreased
for correlated additive noise coexisting with uncorrelated multiplicative
noise. An application of our study to neuron ensembles has demonstrated the
possibility that information is conveyed by the variance and synchrony in input
signals, which accounts for some neuronal experiments.

coding scheme in a two-transmitter, two-receiver Pairwise Collaborative Network

other pair, namely the source pair, by partially decoding and forwarding the
transmitted message to the intended receiver. The relay pair provides such
assistance while handling a private message. We assume that users can use the
past channel outputs and can transmit and receive at the same time and in the
same frequency band. In this collaborative scheme, the transmitter of the
source pair splits its information into two independent parts. Ironically, the
relay pair employs the decode and forward coding to assist the source pair in
delivering a part of its message and re-encodes the decoded message along with
private message, which is intended to the receiver of the relay pair, and
broadcasts the results. The receiver of the relay pair decodes both messages,
retrieves the private message, re-encodes and transmits the decoded massage to
the intended destination. We also characterize the achievable rate region for
Gaussian PCN. Finally, we provide numerical results to study the rate trade off
for the involved pairs. Numerical result shows that the collaboration offers
gain when the channel gain between the users of the relay pair are strong. It
also shows that if the channel conditions between transmitters or between the
receivers of the relay and source pairs are poor, such a collaboration is not
beneficial.

where the background metric is characterized by different time and space warp
factors. The main feature of these models is that 4D Lorentz symmetry is
violated for fields which propagate in the bulk, such as gravitons. In this
paper we examine the case of bulk photons in asymmetrically warped brane
models. Although our results are general, we examine here two specific but
characteristic solutions: 1) AdS-Schwarzschild 5D Black Hole solution and 2)
AdS-Reissner Nordstrom 5D Black Hole solution. We show that the standard
Lorentz invariant dispersion relation for 4D photons is corrected by nonlinear
terms which lead to an Energy-dependent speed of light. Specifically, we obtain
a sub-luminous Energy-dependent refractive index of the form
n_{eff}(\omega)=1+c_{G} \omega^2, where \omega is the energy of the photon, and
the factor c_G is always positive and depends on the free parameters of the
model. Finally, comparing the results with recent data from the MAGIC
Telescope, claiming a delayed arrival of photons from the Active Galactic
Nucleus of Mk501, we impose concrete restrictions to the two sets of models
examined in this work. We shall also discuss briefly other possible

static magnetic field can be used to detect gravitational waves (GWs) with the
same frequency. The presence of GWs will perturb the electromagnetic (EM)
fields, giving rise to perturbed photon fluxes (PPFs). After being reflected by
a fractal membrane, the perturbed photons suffer little decay and can be
measured by a microwave receiver. This idea has been explored to certain extent
as a method for very high frequency gravitational waves. In this paper, we
examine and develop this method more extensively, and confront the possible
detection with the predicted signal of relic gravitational waves (RGWs). A
maser beam with high linear polarization is used to reduce the background
photon fluxes (BPFs) in the detecting direction as the main noise. As a key
factor of applicability of this method, we give a preliminary estimation of the
sensitivity of a sample detector limited by thermal noise using currently
common technology.
  The minimal detectable amplitude of GWs is found to be
$h_{\rm{min}}\sim10^{-30}$. Comparing with the known spectrum of the RGWs in
the accelerating universe for $\beta=-1.9$, there is still roughly a gap of
$4\sim 5$ orders. However, possible improvements on the detector can further
narrow down the gap and make it a feasible method to detect high frequency
RGWs.

physical argument that hydrogen bonding already introduces an effective
stiffness. Contrary to possible physical arguments, favouring bends in the
polymer does not return the model's behaviour to that comparable to the
semi-flexible homogeneous interaction model, where the canonical $\theta$-point
occurs for a range of parameter values. In fact, for sufficiently large bending
energies the crystal phase disappears altogether, and no phase transition of

confirmed that in two dimensions this transition is second-order, unlike in

electrons from adjacent CuO2 layers is proposed. Initially, each CuO2 layer was
found to expand the Fermi sphere owing to ridged geometry. When the two layers
are close enough for tunneling, it becomes energetically advantageous to form
correlated quantum states (CQS), reducing the Fermi sphere volume. Cooper
pairs, comprising inter-tunneling electrons, occupy the CQS. The image force is
responsible for the electron-electron attraction. Energy exchange between the
paired electrons happens through photons. Pair-binding energy and the
corresponding effective mass vary in a wide range. At T>0, some heavy pairs do
not condense. Such pairs are responsible for pseudogap. Light pairs get Bose
condensed and are responsible for superconductivity. The proposed mechanism
provides possible explanation of two energy gaps and two characteristic
temperatures in cuprates. It also provides clarification on the unconventional
isotopic effect, Fermi surface pockets, anisotropy of charge transport, and
other properties of HTS cuprates. The pseudogap, calculated within the model,
is close to the experimental values for the two-layer cuprates, such as YBCO,

of a finite group $G$ acting on a finite set $M$. This includes the finite
monoid $\FP$, which can be seen as a kind of a ``balanced'' generalization of
the symmetric group $S_n$ inside the semigroup of all binary relations. We
describe all irreducible representations of $\fp(G,M)$ and relate them to
irreducible representations of certain inverse semigroups. In particular,
irreducible representations of $\FP$ are related to irreducible representations
of the maximal factorizable submonoid of the dual symmetric inverse monoid. We
also show that in the latter cases irreducible representations lead to an
interesting combinatorial problem in the representation theory of $S_n$, which,
in particular, is related to Foulkes' conjecture. Finally, we show that all
simple $\fp(G,M)$-modules are unitarizable and that tensor products of simple
$\fp(G,M)$-modules are completely reducible.

spectroscopic campaign on the gamma Dor CoRoT target HD49434. This campaign was
preparatory to the CoRoT satellite observations, which took place from October
2007 to March 2008. Results: The frequency analysis clearly shows the presence
of four frequencies in the 0.2-1.7 c/d interval, as well as six frequencies in
the 5-12 c/d domain. The low frequencies are typical for gamma Dor variables
while the high frequencies are common for delta Sct pulsators. We propose the
frequency 2.666 c/d as a possible rotational frequency. All modes, for which an
identification was possible, seem to be high-degree modes (3 <= l <= 8). We did
not find evidence for a possible binary nature of HD49434. The element
abundances we derived are consistent with the values obtained in previous
analyses. Conclusions: We classify the gamma Dor star HD49434 as a hybrid
pulsator, which pulsates simultaneously in p- and g-modes. This finding makes
HD49434 an extremely interesting target for asteroseismic modelling.
Observations: Based on observations made with the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at the
La Silla Observatory under the ESO Large Programme: LP178.D-0361. Also based on
observations obtained at Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (Spain), at the Centro
Astronomico Hispano Aleman at Calar Alto (Spain), at Observatorio Astronomico
Nacional San Pedro Martir (Mexico), at the Piszkesteto Mountain Station of
Konkoly Observatory (Hungary), at Observatoire de Haute Provence (France) and

semiconductors, utilized in field-effect transistors (FETs), is one of the
cornerstones of current information processing technologies. Spintronics which
is based on manipulating the collective state of electron spins in a
ferromagnet provides complementary technologies for reading magnetic bits or
for the solid-state memories. The integration of these two distinct areas of
microelectronics in one physical element, with a potentially major impact on
the power consumption and scalability of future devices, requires to find
efficient means for controlling magnetization electrically. Current induced
magnetization switching phenomena represent a promising step towards this goal,
however, they relay on relatively large current densities. The direct approach
of controlling the magnetization by low-voltage charge depletion effects is
seemingly unfeasible as the two worlds of semiconductors and metal ferromagnets
are separated by many orders of magnitude in their typical carrier
concentrations. Here we demonstrate that this concept is viable by reporting
persistent magnetization switchings induced by short electrical pulses of a few
volts in an all-semiconductor, ferromagnetic p-n junction.

exchange interaction ($J$) between the qubits one can get the desired states
periodically. A multi electron quantum dot can be a possible realization for
generating such $N$ qubit states with high fidelity. In the limit of $N \to
\infty$, there exists a unique time $t=\frac{1}{J}\cos^{-1}(-1/8)$ where the
Hamiltonian dynamics gives the $N$ qubit state that can assist perfect
teleportation. We have also discussed the effect of the nuclear spin
environment on the fidelity of teleportation for a general $N$ qubit entangled
channel.

implemented by endowing all relevant information spaces with a Euclidean metric

A very general way to achieve a Euclidean embedding of different information
spaces based on cross-tabulation counts (and from other input data formats) is
provided by Correspondence Analysis. From there, the induced ultrametric that
we are particularly interested in takes a sequential - e.g. temporal - ordering
of the data into account. We employ such a perspective to look at narrative,
""the flow of thought and the flow of language"" (Chafe). In application to
policy decision making, we show how we can focus analysis in a small number of
dimensions.

field from the vacuum as a quantum tunneling process we derive, in
semiclassical approximation, a general expression for the pair production rate
in a $z$-dependent electric field $E(z)$ pointing in the $z$-direction. We also
allow for a smoothly varying magnetic field parallel to $E(z)$. The result is
applied to a confined field $E(z)\not=0$ for $|z|\lesssim \ell $, a
semi-confined field $E(z)\not=0$ for $ z\gtrsim 0 $, and a linearly increasing
field $E(z)\sim z$. The boundary effects of the confined fields on
pair-production rates are exhibited. A simple variable change in all formulas
leads to results for electric fields depending on time rather than space.
  In addition, we discuss tunneling processes in which empty atomic bound
states are spontaneously filled by negative-energy electrons from the vacuum
under positron emission. In particular, we calculate the rate at which the
atomic levels of a bare nucleus of finite size $r_{\rm n}$ and large $Z\gg 1$
are filled by spontaneous pair creation.
