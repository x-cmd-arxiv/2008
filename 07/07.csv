classical root systems. The motivation comes from representation theory of
semisimple Lie algebras. In a few instances, splints play a role in determining
branching rules of a module over a complex semisimple Lie algebra when
restricted to a subalgebra. In these particular cases, the set of submodules

discuss both free and constrained evolution schemes. For free evolution of
ADM-like equations we propose the use of the Stoermer-Verlet method, a standard
symplectic integrator which here is explicit in the computationally expensive
curvature terms. For the constrained evolution we give a formulation of the
evolution equations that enforces the momentum constraints in a holonomically
constrained Hamiltonian system and turns the Hamilton constraint function from
a weak to a strong invariant of the system. This formulation permits the use of
the constraint-preserving symplectic RATTLE integrator, a constrained version
of the Stoermer-Verlet method.
  The behavior of the methods is illustrated on two effectively 1+1-dimensional
versions of Einstein's equations, that allow to investigate a perturbed
Minkowski problem and the Schwarzschild space-time. We compare symplectic and
non-symplectic integrators for free evolution, showing very different numerical
behavior for nearly-conserved quantities in the perturbed Minkowski problem.
Further we compare free and constrained evolution, demonstrating in our
examples that enforcing the momentum constraints can turn an unstable free
evolution into a stable constrained evolution. This is demonstrated in the
stabilization of a perturbed Minkowski problem with Dirac gauge, and in the
suppression of the propagation of boundary instabilities into the interior of

bounds on neutrino masses and on the reheat temperature of the Universe. After
revisiting a known effect coming from an unbounded term in the total CP
asymmetry, we show that an unbounded term in the flavored CP asymmetries has a
stronger impact. It relaxes the lower bound on the reheat temperature down to
10^8 GeV for (M_2-M_1)/M_1=O(1-100) and for a mild tuning of the parameters in
the see-saw orthogonal matrix. We also consider the effect of the Higgs
asymmetry, showing that it lowers the upper bound on the neutrino masses in the
so-called fully flavored regime where classic Boltzmann equations can be used.
Imposing independence of the initial conditions contributes to lower the upper
bound on neutrino masses as well. We study the conditions for the validity of
the usual N_1-dominated scenario and for the applicability of the lower bound
on the lightest right-handed (RH) neutrino mass M_1. We find that except for
the two effective RH neutrino scenario, recovered for M_3 >>10^14 GeV, and for
values M_2 < O(10^11 GeV), the final asymmetry is more naturally dominated by
the contribution from N_2-decays. Finally, we confirm in a general way that
going beyond the hierarchical limit, the effect of washout addition makes the
lower bound on M_1 more stringent for (M_2-M_1)/M_1=O(0.1).

switching on new phases) of the SPS-1a benchmark point. We then show that even

method to study the Virasoro algebra of type IIB superstring theory in the
maximally supersymmetric R-R plane wave background in a semi-light-cone gauge.
Two types of normal ordering have been considered, namely ""phase space normal
ordering"" (PNO) and ""massless normal ordering"" (MNO). The second one, which is
the right one to choose in flat background, has been discarded with the
argument that the Virasoro algebra closes only in the first case. To understand
this issue better with a completely covariant treatment we consider the easiest
case of bosonic strings propagating in an arbitrary pp-wave of the simplest
kind. Using the phase-space method we show that MNO is in fact the right one to
choose because of the following reason. For both types of normal ordering the
energy-momentum tensor satisfies the desired Virasoro algebra up to anomalous
terms proportional to the space-time equation of motion of the background.
However, it is MNO which gives rise to the correct spectrum - we compute the
quadratic space-time action by restricting the string field inside a transverse
Hilbert space. This turns out to be non-diagonal. Diagonalizing this action
reproduces the spectrum directly obtained in light-cone quantization. The same
method with PNO gives rise to a spectrum with negative dimensions.

contain galaxies down to MB=-10-12 within the distance 4-8Mpc. Comparing the
results with the predictions of the standard cosmological LCDM model, we find
that the theory faces a sever problem: it predicts a factor of ten more dwarf
haloes as compared with the observed number of dwarf galaxies. In the LV we
identify voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 4.5Mpc and compare the
observational distribution of void sizes with the voids in very high resolution
simulations of the LCDM model with WMAP1 and WMAP3 parameters. The theoretical
void function matches the observations remarkably well only if we use haloes
with circular velocities Vc larger than 40-45 km/s (Mvir=(1-2)e10msun) for
models with with sigma8 = 0.9 and Vc>35km/s (Mvir=(6-8)e9msun) for sigma8 =
0.75. We exclude the possibility that in the LCDM model haloes with circular
velocities < 35km/s can host galaxies as bright as MB=-12: there are too many
small haloes in the LCDM model resulting in voids being too small as compared
with the observations. The problem is that many of the observed dwarf galaxies
have HI rotational velocities below 25km/s that strictly contradicts the LCDM
predictions. Thus, the LCDM model faces the same overabundance problem, which
it had with the number of satellites in the LG. We also estimate the rms
deviations from the Hubble flow sigmaH and find that in most of our model
LV-candidates the rms peculiar velocities are consistent with observational
values sigmaH=50km/s for distances less than 3Mpc and sigmaH=80km/s for
distances less than 8Mpc. At distances 4 (8) Mpc, the observed overdensities of

little contamination of the high-ion (OVI, NV, CIV, SiIV) absorption, allowing
us to explore the properties of the highly ionized gas and its connection to
other gas-phases. The metallicity ([Z/H]=-1.41+/-0.08), HI column density (log

abundances ([Si/Fe]=+0.23+/-0.05 and [N/Si]=-0.88+/-0.07) of this DLA are not
unusual. However, we derive the lowest CII* cooling rate in a DLA, l_c <
10^{-27.8} erg/s per H atom (3\sigma). Using this stringent limit, we show that
the neutral gas (confined at |v|<+39 km/s) must be warm and the star formation
rate is <7.1x10^{-3} M_odot/yr/kpc^2. Surprisingly, the gas shows strong,
complex absorption profiles from highly ionized gas whose kinematics appear
connected to each other and the low ions. The total amount of highly and weakly
ionized gas is very large with N(HII)/N(HI)>1.5. At |v|>+39 km/s, the gas is
fully and highly ionized (H+/H~1, N(CIV)>>N(CII), N(SiIV)>>N(SiII)). Based on
ionization models, OVI and NV are generally difficult to produce by hard
photons, while SiIV and CIV can be photoionized to a large extent. There is,
however, no evidence of OVI-bearing gas at T~10^6 K associated with this DLA.
In contrast, there is some evidence for narrow OVI, NV, and CIV components
(unexplained by photoionization), implying too low temperatures (T < 10^5 K)
for simple collisional ionization models to produce their observed column
densities. Stellar feedback is a possible source for producing the high ions,

\partial\Sigma$ in $\partial N$ bounds an odd or even number of embedded
minimal surfaces diffeomorphic to $\Sigma$ according to whether $\Sigma$ is or
is not a union of disks. First, we prove that the parity theorem holds for any
compact riemannian 3-manifold $N$ such that $N$ is strictly mean convex, $N$ is
homeomorphic to a ball, $\partial N$ is smooth, and $N$ contains no closed
minimal surfaces. We then further relax the hypotheses by allowing $N$ to be
weakly mean convex and to have piecewise smooth boundary. We extend the parity
theorem yet further by showing that, under an additional hypothesis, it remains
true for minimal surfaces with prescribed symmetries.
  The parity theorems are used in an essential way to prove the existence of
embedded genus-$g$ helicoids in $\SS^2\times \RR$. We give a very brief outline
of this application. (The full argument will appear elsewhere.)

distributions of accelerated ions associated with the shock event encountered
on day 292 of 1991 by the Ulysses mission at 4.5 AU. A kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation is employed here to model the diffusive acceleration process. This
exposition presents recent developments pertaining to the incorporation into
the simulation of the diffusive characteristics incurred by field line
wandering (FLW), according to the work of Giacalone and Jokipii. For a pure
field-line wandering construct, it is determined that the upstream spatial ramp
scales are too short to accommodate the HI-SCALE flux increases for 200 keV
protons, and that the distribution function for H+ somewhat underpopulates the
combined SWICS/HI-SCALE spectra at the shock. This contrasts our earlier
theory/data comparison where it was demonstrated that diffusive transport in
highly turbulent fields according to kinetic theory can successfully account
for both the proton distributions and upstream ramp scales, using a single
turbulence parameter. The principal conclusion here is that, in a FLW scenario,
the transport of ions across the mean magnetic field is slightly less efficient
than is required to effectively trap energetic ions within a few Larmor radii
of the shock layer and thereby precipitate efficient acceleration. This
highlights the contrast between ion transport in highly turbulent shock
environs and remote, less-disturbed interplanetary regions.

indistinguishable from that of Gyr-old dwarfs. This result is identical to that
found earlier in Eta Cha. Gravity-sensitive line indices place the cluster
between the giant and dwarf sequences, and there is clear evidence that Eps Cha
stars have lower surface gravity than Eta Cha stars. This result is consistent
with Eps Cha being the slightly younger PMS association, a few Myr younger
according to the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram placement of these two
clusters and comparison with PMS evolutionary grids. Late M-type Eps Cha
cluster members show a B-band flux excess of ~ 0.2 mag compared to observations
of standard dwarfs, which might be related to enhanced magnetic activity. A
similar level of excess B-band emission appears to be a ubiquitous feature of
low mass members of young stellar populations with ages less than a few hundred
Myr, a very similar timescale to the PMS phase of elevated relative X-ray
luminosity.

previously determined results in flat space-time, it is shown that the
associated Casimir scalar for spin possesses both gravitational contributions
and frame-dependent contributions due to non-inertial motion, where the latter
represents a possible quantum violation of Lorentz invariance that becomes
significant at the Compton wavelength scale. When applied to muon decay near
the event horizon of a microscopic Kerr black hole, it is shown that its
differential cross section is strongly affected by curvature, with particular
sensitivity to changes in the black hole's spin angular momentum. In the
absence of curvature, the non-inertial contributions to the decay spectrum are
also identified and explored in detail, where its potential for observation is
highest for large electron opening angles. It is further shown how possible
contributions to noncommutative geometry can emerge from within this formalism
at some undetermined length scale. Surprisingly, while the potential exists to
identify noncommutative effects in muon decay, the relevant terms make no
contribution to the decay spectrum, for reasons which remain unknown.

A plot of log N(CO) versus log N(H_2) shows that two power-law relationships
are needed for a good fit of the entire sample, with a break located at log
N(CO, cm^-2) = 14.1 and log N(H_2) = 20.4, corresponding to a change in
production route for CO in higher-density gas. Similar logarithmic plots among
all five diatomic molecules allow us to probe their relationships, revealing
additional examples of dual slopes in the cases of CO versus CH (break at log N
= 14.1, 13.0), CH^+ versus H_2 (13.1, 20.3), and CH^+ versus CO (13.2, 14.1).
These breaks are all in excellent agreement with each other, confirming the
break in the CO versus H_2 relationship, as well as the one-to-one
correspondence between CH and H_2 abundances. Our new sight lines were selected
according to detectable amounts of CO in their spectra and they provide
information on both lower-density (< 100 cm^-3) and higher-density diffuse
clouds. The CO versus H_2 correlation and its intrinsic width are shown to be
empirically related to the changing total gas density among the sight lines of
the sample. We employ both analytical and numerical chemical schemes in order
to derive details of the molecular environments. In the low-density gas, where

can start at Reynolds numbers lower than it is predicted by the linear
stability analysis - the subcritical transition to turbulence. To explain these
observations qualitatively we suggest that the onset of subcritical instability
is related to decline of viscosity of the fluid: friction between fluid layers
fails with the increase of the velocity gradient. To describe the declinie of
friction theoretically we relax the the assumption of the stability of the
fluid material and introduce a constant of fluid strength. Particularly, we
enhance the Navier-Stokes model with a failure description by introducing the
fluid strength in the constitutive equation for the viscous stress. The
clasical model is obtained from the enhanced one when strength goes to
infinity. We use the modified Navier-Stokes model to analyze the Couette flow
between two parallel plates and find that the lateral perturbations can
destabilize the flow and the critical Reynolds number is proportional to the
fluid strength. The latter means that the classical Navier-Stokes model of a
stable material with infinite strength does not capture the subcritical
transition to turbulence while the mofified model does.

spectra for such ""proton-dominated"" GRBs in the internal shock scenario through
Monte Carlo simulations, accounting for various processes related to
high-energy electrons and protons. Besides proton and muon synchrotron
components, emission from photomeson-induced secondary pair cascades becomes
crucial, generally enhancing the GeV-TeV and/or eV-keV photons and offering a
signature of UHE protons. In some cases, it can overwhelm the primary electron
component and result in GRBs peaking in the 10 MeV - 1 GeV range, which may be
relevant to some bursts discussed in a recent re-analysis of EGRET TASC data.
The dependence of the spectra on key quantities such as the bulk Lorentz
factor, magnetic field and proton-to-electron ratio is nontrivial due to the
nonlinear nature of cascading and the interplay of electron- and proton-induced

or a Vaidya-anti de Sitter black hole in which an FRW brane is consistently
embedded, resulting in modifications of the 4-dimensional Friedmann equations.
We analyse how the scenario can be visualised and discuss the significance of
each term in these modified equations both for early time and for late time
cosmology. We further analyse the perturbation equations, based on Newtonian as
well as relativistic perturbations and show that the scenario has the
potentiality to explain structure formation by the ``Weyl fluid'' arising from
embedding geometry. The results thus obtained are confronted with observations
as well.

operators are written in terms of a spinless fermion and the Pauli operators.
This representation is canonical, invertible and constraint-free. Importantly,
it simplifies the Hubbard interaction. On a bipartite lattice, the Hubbard
model is reduced to a form in which the exchange interaction emerges simply by
decoupling the Pauli subsystem from the spinless fermion bath. This exchange
correctly reproduces the large $U$ superexchange. Also derived, for
$U=\pm\infty$, is the Hamiltonian to study Nagaoka ferromagnetism. In this
representation, the infinite-$U$ Hubbard problem becomes elegant and easier to
handle. Interestingly, the ferromagnetism in Hubbard model is found to be
related to the gauge invariance of the spinless fermions. Generalization of
this representation for the multicomponent fermions, a new representation for

of $B = 23 \fm 97 \pm 0.10$, $V = 22 \fm 95 \pm 0.05$ and $R = 22 \fm 15 \pm
0.03$ consistent with a pulsar wind nebula. From the R-band image we identified
three knots with $m_R$ = $24 \fm 08 \pm 0.07$ (o1), $24 \fm 15 \pm 0.07$ (o2)
and $24 \fm 24 \pm 0.08$ (o3). We confirm the presence of an optical pulsar
wind nebula around PSR J0205+6449 and give an upper limit of $m_R \approx$ 24
for the optical magnitude of the pulsar. Furthermore we make the tentative
suggestion that our object o1, with an $m_R \approx$ 24.08 is the optical
counterpart. If confirmed the pulsar would have an $L_R/L_x\approx 0.004$ and
an optical efficiency of about 5% of the Crab pulsar. Such a low efficiency is
more consistent with the characteristic age of the pulsar rather than that of
SN 1181.

which was concerned with testing methods for extraction of frequencies of
low-degree solar p modes from data collected by Sun-as-a-star observations. We
have used the new solarFLAG simulator, which includes the effects of correlated
mode excitation and correlations with background noise, to make artificial
timeseries data that mimic Doppler velocity observations of the Sun as a star.
The correlations give rise to asymmetry of mode peaks in the frequency power
spectrum. Ten members of the group (the hounds) applied their ``peak bagging''
codes to a 3456-day dataset, and the estimated mode frequencies were returned
to the hare (who was WJC) for comparison. Analysis of the results reveals a
systematic bias in the estimated frequencies of modes above approximately 1.8
mHz. The bias is negative, meaning the estimated frequencies systematically
underestimate the input frequencies.
  We identify two sources that are the dominant contributions to the frequency
bias. Both sources involve failure to model accurately subtle aspects of the
observed power spectral density in the part (window) of the frequency power
spectrum that is being fitted. One source of bias arises from a failure to
account for the power spectral density coming from all those modes whose
frequencies lie outside the fitting windows. The other source arises from a
failure to account for the power spectral density of the weak l=4 and 5 modes,
which are often ignored in Sun-as-a-star analysis. The Sun-as-a-star
peak-bagging codes need to allow for both sources, otherwise the frequencies
are likely to be biased.

the temporal behavior of real-time systems, in particular when estimating

not induce new interactions of four charged fermions (since these are already
quite constrained) and discard the possibility of cancellations between
diagrams with different messenger particles to circumvent experimental
constraints. The cases studied include classes of dimension 8 operators which
are often referred to as examples for ways to generate large NSIs with matter.
We find that, in the considered scenarios, the NSIs with matter are
considerably more constrained than often assumed in phenomenological studies,
at least ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$. The constraints on the flavour-conserving NSIs
turn out to be even stronger than the ones for operators which also produce
interactions of four charged fermions at the same level. Furthermore, we find
that in all studied cases the generation of NSIs with matter also gives rise to
NSIs at the source and/or detector of a possible future Neutrino Factory.

$V$. The analysis is focused on the surface-surface and surface-particle
configuration. Our approach is based on the exact solution of electromagnetic
problem about the determination of the fluctuating electromagnetic field in the
vacuum gap between two flat parallel surfaces moving relative to each other
with the arbitrary velocity $V$. The velocity dependence of the considered
phenomena is determined by Doppler shift and can be strong for resonant photon
tunneling between surface modes.
  We show that relativistic effects give rise to a mixing of the contributions
from the electromagnetic waves with different polarization to the heat transfer
and the interaction forces. We find that these effects are of the order
$(V/c)^2$. The limiting case when one of the bodies is sufficiently rarefied
gives the heat transfer and the interaction forces between a moving small
particle and a surface.
  We also calculate the friction force acting on a particle moving with an
arbitrary velocity relative to the black body radiation.

are generally statistically consistent, but sometimes achieve slower rates og
convergence than other methods such as AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation.
On the other hand, these other methods can br inconsistent. We identify the
""catch-up phenomenon"" as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of
Bayesian methods. Based on this analysis we define the switch distribution, a
modification of the Bayesian marginal distribution. We show that, under broad
conditions,model selection and prediction based on the switch distribution is
both consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates, thereby resolving the
AIC-BIC dilemma. The method is practical; we give an efficient implementation.
The switch distribution has a data compression interpretation, and can thus be
viewed as a ""prequential"" or MDL method; yet it is different from the MDL
methods that are usually considered in the literature. We compare the switch
distribution to Bayes factor model selection and leave-one-out
cross-validation.

Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations predict flows of the
intergalactic medium along the radial vector of the voids, approximately in the
direction of the infall of matter at the early stages of the galaxy formation.
  AIMS. These flows might be detected by analysing the dependence of the warp
amplitude on the inclination of the galaxies at the shells of the voids with
respect to the radial vector of the voids. This analysis will be the topic of
this paper.
  METHODS. We develop a statistical method of analysing the correlation of the
amplitude of the warp and the inclination of the galaxy at the void surface.
This is applied to a sample of 97 edge-on galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. Our results are compared with the theoretical expectations, which are
also derived in this paper.
  RESULTS. Our results allow us to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., the
non-correlation of the warp amplitude and the inclination of the galaxy with
respect to the void surface) at 94.4% C. L., which is not conclusive. The
absence of the radial flows cannot be excluded at present, although we can put
a constraint on the maximum average density of baryonic matter of the radial
flows of <rho_b> <~ 4 Omega_b rho_crit.

assumption of quantum uncertainty only, has been formerly introduced in two
papers [S. Tosto, Il Nuovo Cimento B, vol. 111, n.2, 1996 and S. Tosto, Il
Nuovo Cimento D, vol. 18, n.12, 1996]. Instead of attempting to increase the
accuracy of some existing computational model through a new kind of
approximation, these papers acknowledge since the beginning the lack of
deterministic information about the local properties of the constituent
particles, considered random, unknown and unpredictable and thus ignored in
principle. The leading idea is that the physical properties of quantum systems
could be inferred merely considering the delocalization ranges of dynamical
variables, rather than their local values. In effect, despite the agnostic
character of the approach proposed, both papers show that the kind of physical
information reachable reproduces exactly in all cases examined that obtained
solving the pertinent wave equations. The concept of quantum uncertainty is
further extended in the present paper to both space and time coordinates,
considering thus a unique spacetime delocalization range and still discarding
since the beginning the local values of the conjugate dynamical variables. The
paper shows an unexpected wealth of information obtainable simply extending the
concept of space uncertainty to that of spacetime uncertainty: the results are
inherently consistent with that of the operator formalism of wave mechanics and
with the basic postulates of special relativity, both inferred as corollaries.
Moreover, even the gravity appears to be essentially a quantum phenomenon. The
most relevant outcomes of special and general relativity are achieved as
straightforward consequence of the space-time delocalization of particles using
the simple quantum formalism first introduced in the early papers.

element $w_0$ of the Weyl group $W$ corresponds a PBW basis of the quantised
enveloping algebra $\mathcal{U}_q^+(\mathfrak{g})$, and one can apply the
theory of deleting-derivation to this iterated Ore extension. In particular,
for each decomposition of $w_0$, this theory constructs a bijection between the
set of prime ideals in $\mathcal{U}_q^+(\mathfrak{g})$ that are invariant under
a natural torus action and certain combinatorial objects called Cauchon
diagrams. In this paper, we give an algorithmic description of these Cauchon
diagrams when the chosen reduced decomposition of $w_0$ corresponds to a good
ordering (in the sense of Lusztig \cite{Lu2}) of the set of positive roots.
This algorithmic description is based on the constraints that are coming from
Lusztig's admissible planes \cite{Lu2}: each admissible plane leads to a set of
constraints that a diagram has to satisfy to be Cauchon. Moreover, we
explicitely describe the set of Cauchon diagrams for explicit reduced
decomposition of $w_0$ in each possible type. In any case, we check that the
number of Cauchon diagrams is always equal to the cardinal of $W$. In
\cite{CM}, we use these results to prove that Cauchon diagrams correspond
canonically to the positive subexpressions of $w_0$. So the results of this
paper also give an algorithmic description of the positive subexpressions of
any reduced decomposition of $w_0$ corresponding to a good ordering.

different spectral states, namely Hard/Intermediate State, Soft/Intermediate
State and High/Soft State. We investigate the spectral variability of the
source across the different spectral states. The hard X-ray spectrum becomes
softer during the HIMS-to-SIMS transition, but it hardens when reaching the HSS
state. A principal component analysis demonstrates that most of the variability
occurs through two independent modes: a pivoting of the spectrum around 6 keV
(responsible for 75% of the variance) and an intensity variation of the hard
component (responsible for 21%). The pivoting is interpreted as due to changes
in the soft cooling photon flux entering the corona, the second mode as
fluctuations of the heating rate in the corona. Our spectral analysis of the
spectra of GX 339-4 shows a high energy excess with respect to pure thermal
Comptonisation models in the HIMS: a non-thermal power-law component seems to
be requested by data. In all spectral states joint IBIS, SPI and JEM-X data are
well represented by hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonisation (EQPAIR). The
spectral evolution seems to be predominantly driven by a reduction of the ratio
of the electron heating rate to the soft cooling photon flux in the corona,
l_h/l_s. The inferred accretion disc soft thermal emission increases by about
two orders of magnitude, while the Comptonised luminosity decreases by at most
a factor of 3. This confirms that the softening we observed is due to a major
increase in the flux of soft cooling photons in the corona associated with a
modest reduction of the electron heating rate.

results of paper II (0807.0869) on the Einstein-de Sitter model, to the $K =

not appear to remain homogeneous along the backward null cone, with a vanishing
volume (average) density as one approaches the Big Bang singularity
hypersurface. Fractal solutions, that is, solutions representing an averaged
and smoothed-out single fractal, were obtained in all three classes of the

universe would have to be an open one. The best fractal metric obtained through

the transverse directions. The coherent states constructed in this paper obey

Due to the presence of the spin degree of freedom both s-wave and p-wave
interactions are allowed at ultralow temperatures. We investigate the phase
diagram of this system as a function of the filling factor in the lowest Landau
level and in terms of the ratio between s- and p-wave interaction strengths. We
show that the presence of attractive interactions induces a wide regime of
phase separation with formation of maximally compact droplets that are either
fully polarized or composed of spin-singlets. In the regime with no phase
separation, we give evidence for fractional quantum Hall states. Most notably,
we find two distinct singlet states at the filling nu =2/3 for different
interactions. One of these states is accounted for by the composite fermion
theory while the other one is a paired state for which we identify two
competing descriptions with different topological structure. This paired state
may be an Abelian liquid of composite spin-singlet Bose molecules with Laughlin
correlations. Alternatively, it may be a known non-Abelian paired state,
indicated by good overlaps with the corresponding trial wavefunction. By fine
tuning of the scattering lengths it is possible to create the non-Abelian

Read for nu =1. For purely repulsive interactions, we also find evidence for a

REOFeAs (RE=Ce,Pr,Nd) and the oxyphosphate CeOFeP, using a first-principles
technique that combines the local density approximation and dynamical
mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT). In the Pr and Nd compounds, the 4f states are
located well below and above the Fermi level E_F, and essentially do not
interact with the iron 3d bands located near E_F, resulting in local moment
behavior. In the Ce compounds, our results reveal a qualitatively different
picture, with the 3d-4f hybridization being sufficiently strong to give rise to
an observable Kondo screening of the local 4f moment. Our LDA+DMFT electronic
structure calculations allow us to estimate the Kondo temperature T_K for both
CeOFeP and CeOFeAs. For the phosphate, the order of magnitude of our estimate
is consistent with the experimental observation of T_K around 10 K. At ambient
pressure, T_K is found to be negligibly small for CeOFeAs. Under applied
hydrostatic pressure, we predict an exponential increase of T_K which reaches
values comparable to the superconducting T_c around 40 K at pressures above 10
GPa. We conjecture that the competition between the Kondo effect and
superconductivity may be at the origin of the monotonous decrease of T_c
observed in CeOFeAs under pressure. We argue that the quantitative aspects of
this competition are inconsistent with a weak-coupling BCS description of the
superconductivity in the oxyarsenides.

difference between Higgs and matter fields, which leads to the well known
problem of potentially large baryon and lepton number violating interactions.
Although these unwanted couplings can be forbidden by continuous or discrete
global symmetries, a theoretical guiding principle for their choice is missing.
We examine this problem for a class of vacua of the heterotic string
compactified on an orbifold. As expected, in general there is no difference
between Higgs and matter. However, certain vacua happen to possess unbroken
matter parity and discrete $R$-symmetries which single out Higgs fields in the
low energy effective field theory. We present a method how to identify maximal
vacua in which the perturbative contribution to the $\mu$-term and the
expectation value of the superpotential vanish. Two vacua are studied in
detail, one with two pairs of Higgs doublets and one with partial gauge-Higgs
unification.

of DNA, observed in this study, opens up real opportunities for application of
DNA in molecular electronics. Interaction of the nucleobases with water
molecules leads to breaking of some of the $\pi$ bonds and appearance of
unbound pi electrons. These unbound electrons contribute significantly to the
charge transfer at room temperature by up to 1000 times, but at low temperature
the efficiency of charge transfer is determined by the spin interaction of the
two unbound electrons located on the intrastrand nucleobases. The charge
exchange between the nucleobases is allowed only when the spins of unbound
electrons are antiparallel. Therefore, the conductance of the DNA molecule can
be controlled by a magnetic field. That effect has potential applications for
developing a nanoscale spintronic device based on the DNA molecule, where
efficiency of spin interaction will be determined by the DNA sequence.

several stages which are usually characterized by the shape of their spectral
energy distributions. Such classification is based on the cloud morphology only
and does not address the dynamical state of the object. In this paper we
investigate the initial cloud collapse and subsequent disk formation through
the dynamical behavior as reflected in the sub-millimeter spectral emission
line profiles. If a young stellar object is to be characterized by its
dynamical structure it is important to know how accurately information about
the velocity field can be extracted and which observables provide the best
description of the kinematics. Of particular interest is the transition from
infalling envelope to rotating disk, because this provides the initial
conditions for the protoplanetary disk, such as mass and size. We use a
hydrodynamical model, describing the collapse of a core and formation of a
disk, to produce synthetic observables which we compare to calculated line
profiles of a simple parameterized model. Because we know the velocity field
from the hydrodynamical simulation we can determine in a quantitative way how
well our best-fit parameterized velocity field reproduces the original. We use
a molecular line excitation and radiation transfer code to produce spectra of
both our hydro dynamical simulation as well as our parameterized model. We find
that information about the velocity field can reasonably well be derived by
fitting a simple model to either single-dish lines or interferometric data, but
preferentially by using a combination of the two. Our result shows that it is
possible to establish relative ages of a sample of young stellar objects using
this method, independently of the details of the hydrodynamical model.

the transmission properties of double-side opened optical cavities: in
particular, this approach is specified for one dimensional (1D) 'Photonic Band
Gap' (PBG) structures. Moreover, we conjecture that the density of the modes
(DOM) is a dynamical variable which has the flexibility of varying with respect
to the boundary conditions as well as the initial conditions; in fact, the e.m.
field generated by two monochromatic counter-propagating pump waves leads to
interference effects inside a quarter-wave (QW) symmetric 1D-PBG structure.
Finally, here, for the first time, a large number of theoretical assumptions on
QNM metrics for an open cavity, never discussed in literature, are proved, and
a simple and direct method to calculate the QNM norm for a 1D-PBG structure is
reported.

pseudoscalar mesons turn out to be small, at odds with experiment and QCD
estimates: this discrepancy is related to the description of chiral symmetry
breaking in this model.
