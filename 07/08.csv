This fractal system is also assumed to have a crossover to homogeneity which
leads to a ""Swiss cheese"" type model, composed by an interior Lemaitre-Tolman
metric and an exterior dust Friedmann solution. The Darmois junction conditions
between the two spacetimes are calculated, and the observational relations
necessary to compare the model with observations are obtained for the interior

to accumulate more than 400 $\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W. in the shoot, a physiological
trait which may be exploited for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils and
waters. . The application of 75 $\mu$M CdCl$_2$ for three days does not show
any effect in the B. juncea growth parameters (F.W. and D.W.) whatever the type
of plantlets. This application decreases also the contents of chlorophyll a,
carotenoids and Chl a/b ratio (2.26) for plantlets regenerated in the absence
of CdCl$_2$ but not those of plantlets regenerated in its presence. Roots have
the highest contents (3071; 1544 $\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) followed by stems (850;

phytoextraction process and seems to be an interesting technology that allows

follow I=K[(V-V_T)/V_T]^ksi with ksi ranging 3.5 to 5.2. I(V) superpose on a
universal curve when shifted by a voltage proportional to the temperature.
Between 1.8 and 10 K a high-field magnetoresistance with large amplitude and a
strong voltage-dependence is observed. Its amplitude only depends on the
magnetic field/temperature ratio. Its origin is attributed to the presence of
paramagnetic states present at the surface or between the nanoparticles. Below
1.8 K, this high-field magnetoresistance abruptly disappears and inverse
tunnelling magnetoresistance is observed, the amplitude of which does not
exceed 1%. At this low temperature, some samples display in their I(V)
characteristics abrupt and hysteretic transitions between the Coulomb blockade
regime and the conductive regime. The increase of the current during these
transitions can be as high as a factor 30. The electrical noise increases when
the sample is near the transition. The application of a magnetic field
decreases the voltage at which these transitions occur so magnetic-field
induced transitions are also observed. Depending on the applied voltage, the
temperature and the amplitude of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field induced
transitions are either reversible or irreversible. These abrupt and hysteretic
transitions are also observed in resistance-temperature measurements. They
could be the soliton avalanches predicted by Sverdlov et al. [Phys. Rev. B 64,
041302 (R), 2001] or could also be interpreted as a true phase transition
between a Coulomb glass phase to a liquid phase of electrons.

of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer providing the ESO community with
spectrally-resolved, near-infrared images at angular resolutions down to 1.1
milliarcsecond and spectral resolutions up to R=12000. Targets as faint as K=13
will be imaged without requiring a brighter nearby reference object. The unique
combination of high-dynamic-range imaging at high angular resolution and high
spectral resolution enables a scientific program which serves a broad user
community and at the same time provides the opportunity for breakthroughs in
many areas of astrophysic including: probing the initial conditions for planet
formation in the AU-scale environments of young stars; imaging convective cells
and other phenomena on the surfaces of stars; mapping the chemical and physical
environments of evolved stars, stellar remnants, and stellar winds; and
disentangling the central regions of active galactic nuclei and supermassive
black holes. VSI will provide these new capabilities using technologies which
have been extensively tested in the past and VSI requires little in terms of
new infrastructure on the VLTI. At the same time, VSI will be able to make
maximum use of new infrastructure as it becomes available; for example, by
combining 4, 6 and eventually 8 telescopes, enabling rapid imaging through the
measurement of up to 28 visibilities in every wavelength channel within a few
minutes. The current studies are focused on a 4-telescope version with an
upgrade to a 6-telescope one. The instrument contains its own fringe tracker
and tip-tilt control in order to reduce the constraints on the VLTI
infrastructure and maximize the scientific return.

study the effect of gravity in the radiation of the stars: applying the

Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have revealed a set of anomalous results, at
large angular scales, that appears inconsistent with the statistical isotropy
expected in the concordance cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. Because these
anomalies seem to indicate a preferred direction in the space, here we
investigate the signatures that a primordial magnetic field, possibly present
in the photon-baryon fluid during the decoupling era, could have produced in
the large-angle modes of the observed CMB temperature fluctuations maps. To
study these imprints we simulate Monte Carlo CMB maps, which are statistically
anisotropic due to the correlations between CMB multipoles induced by the
magnetic field. Our analyses reveal the presence of the North-South angular
correlations asymmetry phenomenon in these Monte Carlo maps, and we use these
information to establish the statistical significance of such phenomenon
observed in WMAP maps. Moreover, because a magnetic field produces planarity in
the low-order CMB multipoles, where the planes are perpendicular to the
preferred direction defined by the magnetic field, we investigate the
possibility that two CMB anomalous phenomena, namely the North-South asymmetry
and the quadrupole-octopole planes alignment, could have a common origin. Our
results, for large-angles, show that the correlations between low-order CMB

Rewritten in this form, all tree-level MHV and next-to-MHV amplitudes exhibit
manifest dual superconformal symmetry. We propose a new, compact and Lorentz
covariant formula for the tree-level NMHV amplitudes for arbitrary numbers and
types of external particles. The dual conformal symmetry is broken at loop
level by infrared divergences. However, we provide evidence that the anomalous
contribution to the MHV and NMHV superamplitudes is the same and, therefore,
their ratio is a dual conformal invariant function. We identify this function
by an explicit calculation of the six-particle amplitudes at one loop. We
conjecture that these properties hold for all, MHV and non-MHV, superamplitudes

of ECS progenitors. We also find that ECS-HMXBs form through a specific
evolutionary channel that is expected to lead to binaries with Be donors in
wide orbits. These characteristics, along with their sensitivity to ECS
properties, provide us with an intriguing opportunity to probe ECS physics and
progenitors through studies of starbursts of different ages. Specifically, the
case of the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a significant observed population of
Be HMXBs and starburst activity 30-60 Myr ago, arises as a promising laboratory
for understanding the role of electron-capture supernovae in neutron star
formation.

optical Hubble Space Telescope observations. The physical properties of the
SSCs are derived from fitting model spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to the
optical photometry, as well as from the H_alpha and Pa_alpha nebular emission.
Among the clusters, we find a significant age spread that is correlated with
position in the galaxy, suggesting successive cluster formation occurred in SBS
0335-052 triggered by a large-scale disturbance traveling through the galaxy at
a speed of ~35 km/s. The SSCs exhibit I-band (~0.8 um) and near-IR (~1.6-2.1
um) excesses with respect to model SEDs fit to the optical data. We hypothesize
that the I-band excess is dominated by a photoluminescent process known as
Extended Red Emission; however, this mechanism cannot account for the excesses
observed at longer near-IR wavelengths. From the cluster SEDs and colors, we
find that the primary origin of the near-IR excess observed in the youngest
SSCs (<3 Myr) is hot dust emission, while evolved red supergiants dominate the
near-IR light in the older (>7 Myr) clusters. We also find evidence for a
porous and clumpy interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding the youngest, embedded
SSCs: the ionized gas emission underpredicts the expected ionizing luminosities
from the optical stellar continuum, suggesting ionizing photons are leaking out
of the immediate vicinity of the clusters before ionizing hydrogen. The
corrected, intrinsic ionizing luminosities of the two SSCs younger than ~3 Myr
are each ~ 5x10^52 s^-1, which is equivalent to each cluster hosting ~5000 O7.5
V stars. The inferred masses of these SSCs are ~10^6 M_sun.

commonly exist in multiple-star systems. At least ~20%, and presumably a larger
fraction of the known extrasolar planetary systems are associated with one or
more stellar companions. These stellar companions normally exist at large
distances from the planetary systems (typical projected binary separations are
on the orders 100-10000AU) and are often faint (ranging from F to T spectral
types). Yet, secular cyclic angular momentum exchange with these distant
stellar companions can significantly alter the orbital configuration of the
planets around the primaries. One of the most interesting and fairly common
outcomes seen in numerical simulations is the opening of a large mutual
inclination angle between the planetary orbits, forced by differential nodal
precessions caused by the binary companion. The growth of the mutual
inclination angle between planetary orbits induces additional large-amplitude
eccentricity oscillations of the inner planet due to the quadrupole
gravitational perturbation by the outer planet. This eccentricity oscillation
may eventually result in the orbital decay of the inner planet through tidal
friction, as previously proposed as Kozai migration or Kozai cycles with tidal
friction (KCTF). This orbital decay mechanism induced by the binary
perturbation and subsequent tidal dissipation may stand as an alternative
formation channel for close-in extrasolar planets.

attend to this problem by estimating the diagonal and off-diagonal parts of the

regularity conditions on the covariance kernel and assuming i.i.d. samples, the
risk of our estimator, under $L^2$ loss, achieves the optimal nonparametric
rate when the number of measurements per curve is bounded. We also show that
even when the sample curves are correlated in such a way that the noiseless

with Pseudo-$C_\ell$ methods. The performance of the needlet spectral
estimators (NSE) compares very favorably to the best Pseudo--$C_\ell$
estimators, over the whole multipole range. On simulations with a simple model
(CMB + uncorrelated noise with known variance per pixel + mask), they perform
uniformly better. Their distinctive ability to aggregate many different
experiments, to control the propagation of errors and to produce a single
wide-band error bars is highlighted. The needlet spectral estimator is a
powerful, tunable tool which is very well suited to angular power spectrum
estimation of spherical data such as incomplete and noisy CMB maps.

critical surface density below which star formation does not take place. Signs
of filamentary star formation beyond this threshold radius have been observed
in individual galaxies in the Halpha and recent GALEX surveys have discovered
that 30% of disk galaxies show UV emission out to 2-3 times the optical radius

galaxies with constant density extended gas disks to test whether
over-densities owing to spiral structure in the outer disk can reproduce the
observed star formation. We indeed find that spiral density waves from the
inner disk propagate into the outer gas disk and raise local gas regions above
the star formation density threshold, yielding features similar to those
observed. Because the amount of star formation is low, we expect to see little
optical emission in outer disks, as observed. Our results indicate that XUV
disks can be simulated simply by adding an extended gas disk with a surface
density near the threshold density to an isolated galaxy and evolving it with
fiducial star formation parameters.

lines such as the BrG 2.166 micron line are widely used, although due to a lack
of spatial resolution, the origin of the line emission is still unclear.
Employing the AU-scale spatial resolution which can be achieved with infrared
long-baseline interferometry, we aim to distinguish between theoretical models
which associate the BrG line emission with mass infall or mass outflow
processes. Using the VLTI/AMBER instrument, we spatially and spectrally
(R=1500) resolved the inner environment of five Herbig Ae/Be stars (HD163296,
HD104237, HD98922, MWC297, V921Sco) in the BrG emission line as well as in the
adjacent continuum. All objects (except MWC297) show an increase of visibility
within the BrG emission line, indicating that the BrG-emitting region in these
objects is more compact than the dust sublimation radius. For HD98922, our
quantitative analysis reveals that the line-emitting region is compact enough
to be consistent with the magnetospheric accretion scenario. For HD163296,
HD104237, MWC297, and V921Sco we identify a stellar wind or a disk wind as the
most likely line-emitting mechanism. We search for general trends and find that
the size of the BrG-emitting region does not seem to depend on the basic
stellar parameters, but correlates with the H-alpha line profile shape. We find
evidence for at least two distinct BrG line-formation mechanisms. Stars with a

described by a halo profile that has undergone adiabatic contraction,
inconsistent with the findings for most disk galaxies to date, yet consistent
with rotation curve studies of M31. More importantly, we find that Malin 1 is
baryon dominated in its central regions out to a radius of $\sim10$ kpc (in the

dark matter dominated at all radii. If this is the case, then Malin 1 would
seem to have characteristics similar to those of normal barred disk galaxies,

obtained with several non-homogeneous methods, each carrying its own set of
liabilities. In this paper we use the physical properties of the PNe in the
Magellanic Clouds, and their accurately known distances, to recalibrate the
Shklovsky/Daub distance technique. Our new calibration is very similar (within
1 percent) of the commonly used distance scale by Cahn et al. (1992), although
there are important differences. We find that neither distance scale works well
for PNe with classic (""butterfly"") bipolar morphology, and while the radiation
bounded PN sequences in both the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud calibration
have similar slopes, the transition from optically thick to optically thin
appears to occur at higher surface brightness and smaller size than that
adopted by Cahn et al. The dispersion in the determination of the scale factor
suggests that PN distances derived by this method are uncertain by at least 30
percent, and that this dispersion cannot be reduced significantly by using
better calibrators. We present a catalog of Galactic PN distances using our
re-calibration which can be used for future applications, and compare the best
individual Galactic PN distances to our new and several other distance scales,
both in the literature and newly recalibrated by us, finding that our scale is

robust with respect to possible sources of decoherence. We also study the

above the spin gap. In this limit, we can define an effective Heisenberg

coupling in future mobile societies. In such a paradigm, messages are sent to
inferred behavioral profiles, instead of explicit IDs. Our paper provides a
systematic framework in providing such services. First, user behavioral
profiles are constructed based on traces collected from two large wireless
networks, and their spatio-temporal stability is analyzed. The implicit
relationship discovered between mobile users could be utilized to provide a
service for message delivery and discovery in various network environments. As
an example application, we provide a detailed design of such a service in
challenged opportunistic network architecture, named CSI. We provide a fully
distributed solution using behavioral profile space gradients and small world
structures.
  Our analysis shows that user behavioral profiles are surprisingly stable,
i.e., the similarity of the behavioral profile of a user to its future
behavioral profile is above 0.8 for two days and 0.75 for one week, and remains
above 0.6 for five weeks. The correlation coefficient of the similarity metrics
between a user pair at different time instants is above 0.7 for four days, 0.62
for a week, and remains above 0.5 for two weeks. Leveraging such a stability in
user behaviors, the CSI service achieves delivery rate very close to the
delay-optimal strategy (above 94%), with minimal overhead (less than 84% of the
optimal). We believe that this new paradigm will act as an enabler of multiple
new services in mobile societies, and is potentially applicable in
server-based, heterogeneous or infrastructure-less wireless environments.

galaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating black
hole masses. This analysis implies that, at least for the most luminous

radius-luminosity relation or the MgII broad emission line region is not
totally dominated by virial velocities.
  Finally we exploit the measured scatter in line widths to constrain models

especially because the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be
similar. For this reason, the built-in SIP overload control mechanism based on
generating rejection messages cannot prevent the server from entering
congestion collapse under heavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a
pushback control solution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server
may notify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the amount of
load within the receiving server's processing capacity. The pushback framework
can be achieved by either a rate-based feedback or a window-based feedback. The
centerpiece of the feedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load
regulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback algorithms

compare the different algorithms in terms of the number of tuning parameters

two categories of fairness requirements for SIP overload control, namely,

Pages 22",,,,"cs.LO cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider two-player games played in real time on game structures with
clocks and parity objectives. The games are concurrent in that at each turn,
both players independently propose a time delay and an action, and the action
with the shorter delay is chosen. To prevent a player from winning by blocking
time, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot
be responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction
of these games to turn-based (i.e., nonconcurrent) finite-state (i.e., untimed)
parity games. The states of the resulting game are pairs of clock regions of
the original game. Our reduction improves the best known complexity for solving
timed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical parity
games can now be applied to timed parity games.
  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that
represents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,
limit-robust and bounded-robust strategies. Using a limit-robust strategy, the
controller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow for
some nonzero jitter in each of its actions. If there is a given lower bound on
the jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust. We show that exact strategies
are more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than
bounded-robust strategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies,
we present efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These
reductions provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time
controllers.

presence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus central
bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamical
mass appears to scale with [NII]/Ha flux ratio and star formation age. We
propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at
z~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High
redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be
stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretion
flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result dynamical friction and
viscous processes proceed on a time scale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of
magnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives
gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and
massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with
increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help
to account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massive
galaxies at z~2.

400 MeV) using the short version of the COSY-TOF spectrometer. The central
calorimeter provided particle identification, energy determination and neutron
detection in addition to time-of-flight and angle measurements from other
detector parts. Thus all pion production channels were recorded with 1-4
overconstraints. Main emphasis is put on the presentation and discussion of the
$np\pi^+$ channel, since the results on the other channels have already been
published previously. The total and differential cross sections obtained are
compared to theoretical calculations. In contrast to the $pp\pi^0$ channel we
find in the $np\pi^+$ channel a strong influence of the $\Delta$ excitation
already at this energy close to threshold. In particular we find a $(3
cos^2\Theta + 1)$ dependence in the pion angular distribution, typical for a
pure s-channel $\Delta$ excitation and identical to that observed in the
$d\pi^+$ channel. Since the latter is understood by a s-channel resonance in
the $^1D_2$ $pn$ partial wave, we discuss an analogous scenario for the
$pn\pi^+$ channel.

functional theory. The force constant matrices are obtained from standard

from the nonequilibrium Green's function and the mode-matching method. We find
that the ballistic thermal conductance is not sensitive to the compression or
stretching of the molecular junction. The terminating groups of the SWCNTs at
the cutting edges only influence the thermal conductance quantitatively. The
conductance of the benzene and alkane chains shows large difference. Analysis
of the transmission spectrum shows that (i) the low temperature thermal
conductance is mainly contributed by the SWCNT transverse acoustic modes, (ii)
the degenerate phonon modes show different transmission probability due to the
presence of molecular junction, (iii) the SWCNT twisting mode can hardly be
transmitted by the alkane chain. As a result, the ballistic thermal conductance
of alkane chains is larger than that of benzene chains below 38 K, while it is
smaller at higher temperature.

the first switching events from zero-voltage state showed a good agreement with
the conventional theory for a single Josephson junction, indicating that a
crossover temperature from thermal activation to MQT regime for the former
device structure was as high as that for the latter device structure. Together
with the observation of multiphoton transitions between quantized energy levels
in MQT regime, these results strongly suggest that the observed MQT behavior is
intrinsic to a single IJJ in high-$T_c$ cuprates, independent of device
structures. The switching current distribution for the second switching events
from the first resistive state, which were carefully distinguished from the
first switchings, was also compared between two device structures. In spite of
the difference in the heat transfer environment, the second switching events

influence of the stellar iron content on the PL relation in the V and K bands,
we have related the V-band and the K-band residuals from the standard PL
relations of Freedman et al. (2001) and Persson et al. (2004), respectively, to
[Fe/H]. We used direct measurements of the iron abundances of 68 Galactic and
Magellanic Cepheids from FEROS and UVES high-resolution and high
signal-to-noise spectra. We find a mean iron abundance ([Fe/H]) about solar
(sigma = 0.10) for our Galactic sample (32 stars), -0.33 dex (sigma = 0.13) for
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) sample (22 stars) and -0.75 dex (sigma = 0.08)
for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) sample (14 stars). Our abundance
measurements of the Magellanic Cepheids double the number of stars studied up
to now at high resolution. The metallicity affects the V-band Cepheid PL
relation and metal-rich Cepheids appear to be systematically fainter than
metal-poor ones. These findings depend neither on the adopted distance scale
for Galactic Cepheids nor on the adopted LMC distance modulus. Current data do
not allow us to reach a firm conclusion concerning the metallicity dependence
of the K-band PL relation. The new Galactic distances indicate a small effect,

reduce to the concordance cosmological scenario (Lambda-CDM) at early
cosmological times. From the mechanism of gravitational polarization, we
recover the phenomenology of MOND in a typical galaxy at low redshift.

function has evolved through mutations to genes, as observed in the evolution
of funnel landscape in protein. We study this evolutionary process with a
statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins, where the fitted phenotype
is represented by a configuration of a given set of ""target spins"" and
interaction matrix J among spins is genotype evolving over generations. The
expression dynamics is given by stochastic process with temperature T_S to
decrease energy for a given set of J. The evolution of J is also stochastic
with temperature T_J, following mutation in J and selection based on a fitness
given by configurations of the target spins. Below a certain temperature
T_S^{c2}, the highly adapted J evolves, whereasanother phase transition
characterised by frustration occurs at T_S^{c1}<T_S^{c2}. At temperature lower
than T_S^{c1}, the Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass like phase, where the
dynamics requires long time steps to produce the fitted phenotype, and the
fitness often decreases drastically by single mutation. In contrast, in the
intermediate temperature phase between T_S^{c1} and T_S^{c2}, the evolved
genotypes, that have no frustration around the target spins (we call ""local
Mattis state""), give a funnel-like rapid expression dynamics and are robust to
mutation. These results imply that evolution under thermal noise beyond a

channels. The scheme, which we call multi-rate sampling (MRS), entails
gathering samples at several different rates whose sum is significantly lower
than the Nyquist sampling rate. The number of channels does not depend on any
characteristics of a signal. In order to be implemented with simplified
hardware, the reconstruction method does not rely on the synchronization
between different sampling channels. Also, because the method does not solve a
system of linear equations, it avoids one source of lack of robustness of
previously published undersampling schemes. Our simulations indicate that our
MRS scheme is robust both to different signal types and to relatively high
noise levels. The scheme can be implemented easily with optical sampling
systems.

TeV energy domain. These binaries are composed of a massive star and a compact
object, possibly a young pulsar. The gamma-ray emission would be due to
particle acceleration at the collision site between the relativistic pulsar
wind and the stellar wind of the massive star. Part of the emission may also
originate from inverse Compton scattering of stellar photons on the unshocked
(free) pulsar wind. The purpose of this work is to constrain the bulk Lorentz
factor of the pulsar wind and the shock geometry in the compact pulsar wind
nebula scenario for LS 5039 and LSI +61$\degr$303 by computing the unshocked
wind emission and comparing it to observations. Anisotropic inverse Compton
losses equations are derived and applied to the free pulsar wind in binaries.
The unshocked wind spectra seen by the observer are calculated taking into
account the gamma-gamma absorption and the shock geometry. A pulsar wind
composed of monoenergetic pairs produces a typical sharp peak at an energy
which depends on the bulk Lorentz factor and whose amplitude depends on the
size of the emitting region. This emission from the free pulsar wind is found
to be strong and difficult to avoid in LS 5039 and LSI +61$\degr$303. If the
particles in the pulsar are monoenergetic then the observations constrain their
energy to roughly 10-100 GeV. For more complex particle distributions, the free
pulsar wind emission will be difficult to distinguish from the shocked pulsar
wind emission.

ad-hoc networks comprising heterogeneous nodes with restricted mobility. We
show that node spatial heterogeneity has the ability to drastically improve

identical and uniformly visit the entire network area. In particular, we
consider the situation in which each node moves around its own home-point
according to a restricted mobility process which results into a spatial
stationary distribution that decays as a power law of exponent delta with the
distance from the home-point. For such restricted mobility model, we propose a
novel class of scheduling and routing schemes, which significantly outperforms
all delay-throughput results previously obtained in the case of identical
nodes. In particular, for delta = 2 it is possible to achieve almost constant
delay and almost constant per-node throughput (except for a poly-logarithmic
factor) as the number of nodes increases, even without resorting to
sophisticated coding or signal processing techniques.

There is ample of evidence that the emission has its origin in synchrotron
losses of relativistic electrons, accelerated in the course of clusters
mergers. In a cosmological simulation we locate the structure formation shocks
and estimate their radio emission. We proceed as follows: Introducing a novel
approach to identify strong shock fronts in an SPH simulation, we determine the
Mach number as well as the downstream density and temperature in the
MareNostrum Universe simulation which has 2x1024^3 particles in a 500 Mpc/h box
and was carried out with non-radiative physics. Then, we estimate the radio
emission using the formalism derived in Hoeft & Brueggen (2007) and produce
artificial radio maps of massive clusters. Several of our clusters show radio
objects with similar morphology to large-scale radio relics found in the sky,
whereas about half of the clusters show only very little radio emission. In
agreement with observational findings, the maximum diffuse radio emission of
our clusters depends strongly on their X-ray temperature. We find that the
so-called accretion shocks cause only very little radio emission. We conclude
that a moderate efficiency of shock acceleration, namely xi_e <= 0.005, and
moderate magnetic fields in the region of the relics, namely 0.07 to 0.8
muGauss are sufficient to reproduce the number density and luminosity of radio
relics.

individual Baade-Wesselink distances (some of the stars also have an HST-based
parallax) and individually determined metallicities from high-resolution
spectroscopy. Literature values of the $V$-band, $K$-band and radial velocity
data have been collected for a sample of 68 classical cepheids that have their
metallicity determined in the literature from high-resolution spectroscopy.
Based on a $(V-K)$ surface-brightness relation and a projection factor derived
in a previous paper, distances have been derived from a Baade-Wesselink
analysis. $PL$- and $PLZ$-relations in $V$ and $K$ are derived. The effect of
the adopted dependence of the projection factor on period is investigated. The
change from a constant $p$-factor to one recently suggested in the literature
with a mild dependence on $\log P$ results in a less steep slope by 0.1 unit,
which is about the 1-sigma error bar in the slope itself. The observed slope in
the $PL$-relation in $V$ in the LMC agrees with both hypotheses. In $K$ the
difference between the Galactic and LMC slope is larger and would favour a mild
period dependence of the $p$-factor. The dependence on metallicity in $V$ and
$K$ is found to be marginal, and independent of the choice of $p$-factor on
period. This result is severely limited by the small range in metallicity
covered by the Galactic Cepheids.

of stars known to harbour planets. These disks are detected because dust is
created in the destruction of planetesimals in the disks much in the same way
that dust is produced in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt in the solar system.
For the nearest stars the structure of their debris disks can be directly
imaged, showing a wide variety of both axisymmetric and asymmetric structures.
A successful interpretation of these images requires a knowledge of the
dynamics of small bodies in planetary systems, since this allows the observed
dust distribution to be deconvolved to provide information on the distribution
of larger objects, such as planetesimals and planets. This chapter reviews the
structures seen in debris disks, and describes a disk dynamical theory which
can be used to interpret those observations. In this way much of the observed
structures, both axisymmetric and asymmetric, can be explained by a model in
which the dust is produced in a planetesimal belt which is perturbed by a
nearby, as yet unseen, planet. While the planet predictions still require
confirmation, it is clear that debris disks have the potential to provide
unique information about the structure of extrasolar planetary systems, since
they can tell us about planets analogous to Neptune and even the Earth.
Significant failings of the model at present are its inability to predict the
quantity of small grains in a system, and to explain the origin of the
transient dust seen in some systems. Given the complexity of planetary system
dynamics and how that is readily reflected in the structure of a debris disk,
it seems inevitable that the study of debris disks will play a vital role in
our understanding of extrasolar planetary systems.

represented as a straight thin flux tube under the effect of an external driver
modeling the global coronal EIT wave. We investigate how the generated
oscillations depend on the nature of the driver, and the type of interaction
between the two systems. We consider the oscillations of a magnetic straight
cylinder with fixed-ends under the influence of an external driver modeling the
force due to the global EIT wave. Given the uncertainties related to the nature
of EIT waves, we first approximate the driver by an oscillatory force in time
and later by a shock with a finite width. Results show that for a harmonic
driver the dominant period in the generated oscillation belongs to the driver.
Depending on the period of driver, compared to the natural periods of the loop,
a mixture of standing modes harmonics can be initiated. In the case of a
non-harmonic driver (modeling a shock wave), the generated oscillations in the
loop are the natural periods only. The amplitude of oscillations is determined
by the position of the driver along the tube. The full diagnosis of generated
oscillations is achieved using simple numerical methods.

common. Let m(k) be the largest integer m such that any linear k-CNF formula
with <= m clauses is satisfiable. We show that 4^k / (4e^2k^3) <= m(k) < ln(2)
k^4 4^k. More generally, a (k,d)-CSP is a constraint satisfaction problem in
conjunctive normal form where each variable can take on one of d values, and
each constraint contains k variables and forbids exacty one of the d^k possible
assignments to these variables. Call a (k,d)-CSP l-disjoint if no two distinct
constraints have l or more variables in common. Let m_l(k,d) denote the largest
integer m such that any l-disjoint (k,d)-CSP with at most m constraints is
satisfiable. We show that 1/k (d^k/(ed^(l-1)k))^(1+1/(l-1))<= m_l(k,d) < c
(k^2/l ln(d) d^k)^(1+1/(l-1)). for some constant c. This means for constant l,
upper and lower bound differ only in a polynomial factor in d and k.

combined with symmetric external input signals, deterministic or random, alike,
can assist directed motion of particles at the submicron scales. In such cases,
one speaks of ""Brownian motors"". In this review the constructive role of
Brownian motion is exemplified for various one-dimensional setups, mostly
inspired by the cell molecular machinery: working principles and
characteristics of stylized devices are discussed to show how fluctuations,
either thermal or extrinsic, can be used to control diffusive particle
transport. Recent experimental demonstrations of this concept are reviewed with
particular attention to transport in artificial nanopores and optical traps,
where single particle currents have been first measured. Much emphasis is given
to two- and three-dimensional devices containing many interacting particles of
one or more species; for this class of artificial motors, noise rectification
results also from the interplay of particle Brownian motion and geometric
constraints. Recently, selective control and optimization of the transport of
interacting colloidal particles and magnetic vortices have been successfully
achieved, thus leading to the new generation of microfluidic and
superconducting devices presented hereby. Another area with promising potential
for realization of artificial Brownian motors are microfluidic or granular
set-ups.....

the inclusion of hadronic vacuum polarization in the photon propagator. We
present predictions for the contributions from reducible amplitudes which are
proportional to the vacuum polarization $\pi(q^2)$ and from irreducible ones
where the vacuum polarization appears in a loop representing vertex or box
diagrams. The second case can be treated by using dispersion relations with a
weight function proportional to the $R$-ratio as measured in electron-positron
annihilation into hadrons and kernels that can be calculated perturbatively. We
present simple analytical forms for the kernels and, using two convenient
parametrizations for the function $R(s)$, numerical results for the quantities
of interest. As a cross check we evaluate the corresponding corrections
resulting from light and heavy lepton loops and we find perfect agreement with
previous calculations. For the hadronic correction our result are in good
agreement with a previous evaluation.

expansion (NTE) in under-constrained systems. The dynamics of these models
reveals how underconstraint can organize a thermodynamically extensive manifold
of low-energy modes which not only drives NTE but extends across the Brillioun
zone. Mixing of twist and translation in the eigenvectors of these modes, for
which in ZrW2O8 there is evidence from infrared and neutron scattering
measurements, emerges naturally in our model as a signature of the dynamics of
underconstraint.
