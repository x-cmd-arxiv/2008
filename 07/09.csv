conjecture a mathematical relation between the intersection cohomology of the
moduli space of G-bundles on certain singular complex surfaces, and the
integrable representations of the Langlands dual of an associated affine
G-algebra, where G is any simply-connected semisimple group. For the A-type

be understood as an expected invariance in the resulting spacetime BPS spectrum
under string dualities. By replacing the singular complex surface with a smooth
multi-Taub-NUT manifold, we find agreement with a closely related result
demonstrated earlier via purely field-theoretic considerations by Witten. By
adding OM five-planes to the original analysis, we argue that an analogous
relation involving the non-simply-connected D-type groups, ought to hold as

solution of this constraint leads to non-local SLAC-type derivatives. We
investigate the corresponding kinetic operators on the lattice within an exact

the overlap operator for supersymmetry - can be made local through a specific

infinite-randomness phases: a random-singlet phase when all bonds prefer the
trivial fusion channel, and a mixed phase which occurs whenever a finite
density of bonds prefers the $\tau$ fusion channel. Real space RG analysis
shows that the random-singlet fixed point is unstable to the mixed fixed point.
By analyzing the entanglement entropy of the mixed phase, we find its effective
central charge, and find that it increases along the RG flow from the random
singlet point, thus ruling out a c-theorem for the effective central charge.

formation of planetary systems. As protoplanets grow, they stir leftover
planetesimals to large velocities. A cascade of collisions then grinds the
leftovers to dust, forming an observable debris disk. Stellar lifetimes and the
collisional cascade limit the growth of protoplanets. The maximum radius of icy
planets, roughly 1750 km, is remarkably independent of initial disk mass,
stellar mass, and stellar age. These objects contain no more than 3% to 4% of
the initial mass in solid material. Collisional cascades produce debris disks
with maximum luminosity of roughly 0.002 times the stellar luminosity. The peak
24 micron excess varies from roughly 1% of the stellar photospheric flux for 1
solar mass stars to roughly 50 times the stellar photospheric flux for 3 solar

programming languages. In prior work, we have introduced a core language for
Flux with a clear operational semantics and a sound, decidable static type
system based on regular expression types.
  Our initial proposal had several limitations. First, it lacked support for
recursive types or update procedures. Second, although a high-level source
language can easily be translated to the core language, it is difficult to
propagate meaningful type errors from the core language back to the source.
Third, certain updates are well-formed yet contain path errors, or ``dead''
subexpressions which never do any useful work. It would be useful to detect
path errors, since they often represent errors or optimization opportunities.
  In this paper, we address all three limitations. Specifically, we present an
improved, sound type system that handles recursion. We also formalize a source
update language and give a translation to the core language that preserves and
reflects typability. We also develop a path-error analysis (a form of dead-code
analysis) for updates.

to a three-stage algorithm: we split our data set in blocks, on which the
estimation of the shifts is done by minimizing a cost criterion based on a
functional of the periodogram; the estimated shifts are then plugged into a
standard density estimator. We show that under mild regularity assumptions the
density estimate converges weakly to the true shift distribution. The theory is
applied both to simulations and to alignment of real ECG signals. The estimator
of the shift distribution performs well, even in the case of low

mechanisms have been proposed, with variants of the Generalized Second Price

  A rich body of work on bipartite matching markets builds upon the stable
marriage model of Gale and Shapley and the assignment model of Shapley and
Shubik. We apply insights from this line of research into the structure of
stable outcomes and their incentive properties to advertising auctions.
  We model advertising auctions in terms of an assignment model with linear
utilities, extended with bidder and item specific maximum and minimum prices.
Auction mechanisms like the commonly used GSP or the well-known
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) are interpreted as simply computing a
\emph{bidder-optimal stable matching} in this model, for a suitably defined set
of bidder preferences. In our model, the existence of a stable matching is
guaranteed, and under a non-degeneracy assumption a bidder-optimal stable
matching exists as well. We give an algorithm to find such matching in
polynomial time, and use it to design truthful mechanism that generalizes GSP,
is truthful for profit-maximizing bidders, implements features like
bidder-specific minimum prices and position-specific bids, and works for rich
mixtures of bidders and preferences.

implementing network coding in large-scale, heterogeneous networks. This paper
examines two tradeoffs in applying RNC: The first studies how the performance
of RNC varies with a node's randomizing capabilities. Specifically, a limited
randomized network coding (L-RNC) scheme - in which intermediate nodes perform
randomized encoding based on only a limited number of random coefficients - is
proposed and its performance bounds are analyzed. Such a L-RNC approach is
applicable to networks in which nodes have either limited computation/storage
capacity or have ambiguity about downstream edge connectivity (e.g., as in ad
hoc sensor networks). A second tradeoff studied here examines the relationship
between the reliability and the capacity gains of generalized RNC, i.e., how
the outage probability of RNC relates to the transmission rate at the source
node. This tradeoff reveals that significant reductions in outage probability
are possible when the source transmits deliberately and only slightly below
network capacity. This approach provides an effective means to improve the
feasibility probability of RNC when the size of the finite field is fixed.

DKPs are knapsack problems with a constraint vector of the form $pM + r, $ with
$p >0$ and $r$ integral vectors, and $M$ a large integer. If the parameters are
suitably chosen in DKPs, we prove 1) hardness results for these problems, when

particle acceleration by shocks. This strong turbulence, which may result from
cosmic ray driven instabilities, both resonant and non-resonant, in the shock
precursor, is certain to play a critical role in self-consistent, nonlinear
models of strong, cosmic ray modified shocks. Here we present a Monte Carlo
model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) accounting for magnetic
field amplification through resonant instabilities induced by accelerated
particles, and including the effects of dissipation of turbulence upstream of a
shock and the subsequent precursor plasma heating. Feedback effects between the
plasma heating due to turbulence dissipation and particle injection are strong,
adding to the nonlinear nature of efficient DSA. Describing the turbulence
damping in a parameterized way, we reach two important results: first, for
conditions typical of supernova remnant shocks, even a small amount of
dissipated turbulence energy (~10%) is sufficient to significantly heat the
precursor plasma, and second, the heating upstream of the shock leads to an
increase in the injection of thermal particles at the subshock by a factor of
several. In our results, the response of the non-linear shock structure to the
boost in particle injection prevented the efficiency of particle acceleration
and magnetic field amplification from increasing. We argue, however, that more
advanced (possibly, non-resonant) models of turbulence generation and
dissipation may lead to a scenario in which particle injection boost due to
turbulence dissipation results in more efficient acceleration and even stronger
amplified magnetic fields than without the dissipation.

clear that not only the heavy fermion phase in these systems provides
interesting physics, but the quantum criticality where such a phase dies
exhibits novel phase transition physics not fully understood. Moreover,
attempts to study the critical point numerically face the infamous fermion sign
problem, which limits their accuracy. Effective action techniques and
Callan-Symanzik equations have been very popular in high energy physics, where
they enjoy a good record of success. Yet, they have been little exploited for
fermionic systems in condensed matter physics. In this work, we apply the RG
effective action and Callan-Symanzik techiques to the heavy fermion problem. We
write for the first time the effective action describing the low energy physics
of the system. The f-fermions are replaced by a dynamical scalar field whose
nonzero expected value corresponds to the heavy fermion phase. This removes the
fermion sign problem, making the effective action amenable to numerical studies
as the effective theory is bosonic. Renormalization group studies of the
effective action can be performed to extract approximations to nonperturbative
effects at the transition. By performing one-loop renormalizations, resummed
via Callan-Symanzik methods, we describe the heavy fermion criticality and
predict the heavy fermion critical dynamical susceptibility and critical
specific heat. The specific heat coefficient exponent we obtain (0.39) is in
excellent agreement with the experimental result at low temperatures (0.4).

mass M*, internal velocity V and characteristic radius R* (or surface

stellar-population parameter such as metallicity Z or star formation rate SFR.
We find that the Local-Group dwarfs basically define a one-parameter
""Fundamental Line"" (FL), primarily driven by stellar mass, M*. A more detailed
inspection reveals differences between the star-formation properties of dwarf
irregulars (dI's) and dwarf ellipticals (dE's), beyond the tendency of the
latter to be more massive. In particular, the metallicities of dI's are
typically lower by a factor of 3 at a given M* and they grow faster with
increasing M*, showing a tighter FL in the 4-D space for the dE's. The
structural scaling relations of dI's resemble those of the more massive
spirals, but the dI's have lower star formation rates for a given M* which also
grow faster with increasing M*. On the other hand, the FL of the dE's departs
from the fundamental plane of bigger ellipticals. While the one-parameter
nature of the FL and the associated slopes of the scaling relations are
consistent with the general predictions of supernova feedback (Dekel & Woo
2003), the differences between the FL's of the dE's and the dI's remain a
challenge and should serve as a guide for the secondary physical processes
responsible for these two types.

We derive trade-offs between the amount of storage noise, the amount of noise

especially on images obtained using cameras onboard the Hubble Space Telescope

quantify the relative importance of spatial, temporal, and color variations of
the point-spread function (PSF). To estimate uncertainties in AGN-to-host
decompositions, we perform extensive simulations that span a wide range in
AGN-to-host galaxy luminosity contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and host galaxy
properties (size, luminosity, central concentration). We find that realistic
PSF mismatches that typically afflict actual observations systematically lead
to an overestimate of the flux of the host galaxy. Part of the problem is
caused by the fact that the HST PSFs are undersampled. We demonstrate that this
problem can be mitigated by broadening both the science and the PSF images to
critical sampling without loss of information. Other practical suggestions are
given for optimal analysis of HST images of AGN host galaxies.

from published optical spectra assuming a spherical broad-line region, and
L(bulge) from detailed two-dimensional decomposition of archival optical Hubble
Space Telescope images. AGNs follow the MBH-L(bulge) relation of inactive
galaxies, but the zero point is shifted by an average of \Delta log MBH ~ -0.3
dex. We show that the magnitude of the zero point offset, which is responsible
for the intrinsic scatter in the MBH-L(bulge) relation, is correlated with
several AGN and host galaxy properties, all of which are ultimately related to,
or directly impact, the BH mass accretion rate. At a given bulge luminosity,
sources with higher Eddington ratios have lower MBH. The zero point offset can
be explained by a change in the normalization of the virial product used to
estimate MBH, in conjunction with modest BH growth (~ 10%--40%) during the AGN
phase. Galaxy mergers and tidal interactions appear to play an important role
in regulating AGN fueling in low-redshift AGNs.

The optical flux decayed steeply with a power-law decay index greater than 3,
later levelling off at R~27.3 mag; this is likely the emission level of the
host galaxy, the faintest yet detected for a short GRB. Spectroscopic
observations did not reveal any line features/edges that could unambiguously
pinpoint the GRB redshift, but set a limit z < 3.6. In the range of allowed
redshifts, the host has a low luminosity, comparable to that of long-duration
GRBs. The existence of such faint host galaxies suggests caution when
associating short GRBs with bright, offset galaxies, where the true host might
just be too dim for detection. The steepness of the decay of the optical
afterglow of GRB 070707 challenges external shock models for the optical

prolonged activity of the central engine or require alternative scenarios.

suggest different phenomenology (critical properties, etc.). We use high

reinforcement are in the same universality class, and that the purported phase
transition in 2 dimensions actually occurs at zero coupling constant. We also

two-dimensional, possibly degenerate reaction-diffusion systems, focusing on
combustion models and models of pattern formation and chemotaxis in
mathematical biology. Solutions of these equations in these applications
exhibit steep gradients, and in the degenerate case, sharp fronts and
discontinuities. The multiresolution scheme is based on finite volume
discretizations with explicit time stepping. The multiresolution representation
of the solution is stored in a graded tree. By a thresholding procedure, namely
the elimination of leaves that are smaller than a threshold value, substantial
data compression and CPU time reduction is attained. The threshold value is
chosen optimally, in the sense that the total error of the adaptive scheme is
of the same slope as that of the reference finite volume scheme. Since chemical
reactions involve a large range of temporal scales, but are spatially well
localized (especially in the combustion model), a locally varying adaptive time
stepping strategy is applied. It turns out that local time stepping accelerates
the adaptive multiresolution method by a factor of two, while the error remains
controlled.

appears continuous due to the frequency-time uncertainty relation, while at
longer times the discrete nature of the bath becomes apparent. Considering the

which is a kind of Monte Carlo method we have proposed in order to numerically
study large quantum spin systems. In the stochastic state selection method we
make a sampling which is simultaneous for many states. This feature enables us
to modify the method so that a number of given constraints are satisfied in
each sampling. In this paper we discuss this modified stochastic state
selection method that will be called the constrained stochastic state selection
method in distinction from the previously proposed one (the conventional
stochastic state selection method) in this paper. We argue that in virtue of
the constrained sampling some quantities obtained in each sampling become more
reliable, i.e. their statistical fluctuations are less than those from the
conventional stochastic state selection method. In numerical calculations of
the spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a 36-site triangular lattice
we explicitly show that data errors in our estimation of the ground state
energy are reduced. Then we successfully evaluate several low-lying energy
eigenvalues of the model on a 48-site lattice. Our results support that this
system can be described by the theory based on the spontaneous symmetry
breaking in the semiclassical Neel ordered antiferromagnet.

cause beam losses that dominate the luminosity decay and may quench
superconducting magnets, setting upper limits on luminosity and stored beam
current. Lower limits are set by beam instrumentation. On the other hand,
coherent radiation by the nuclear charges should provide natural cooling to
overcome intra-beam scattering. As with protons, a flexible, staged approach to

  Most of the near-infrared (NIR) polarizations are dichroic, with position
angles of polarization agreeing, both globally and locally, with previous
far-infrared (FIR) and submillimeter observations, having taken into account
the 90$^\circ $ difference in angles between dichroic absorption and emission.
This is consistent with the idea that both NIR dichroic polarizations and
FIR/submillimeter thermal polarizations trace the magnetic fields in the OMC-1
region. The magnetic fields inferred from these observations show a pinch at
scales less than 0.5 pc with a centroid near IRc2. The hourglass-shaped
magnetic field pattern is explained by the models in which the magnetic field
lines are dragged along with the contracting gas and then wound up by rotation
in a disk. The highly polarized region to the northwest of IRc2 and the
low-polarized region near the bright bar are also common among NIR and
FIR/submillimeter data, although a few regions of discrepancy exist.

particle in mean-motion orbital resonances with a planet is investigated.
Planar circular restricted three-body problem with the Poynting-Robertson (P-R)
effect yields monotonous secular evolution of eccentricity when the particle is
trapped in the resonance. Elliptically restricted three-body problem with the
P-R effect enables nonmonotonous secular evolution of eccentricity and the
evolution of eccentricity is qualitatively consistent with the published
results for the complicated case of interaction of electromagnetic radiation
with nonspherical dust grain. Thus, it is sufficient to allow either nonzero
eccentricity of the planet or nonsphericity of the grain and the orbital
evolutions in the resonances are qualitatively equal for the two cases. This
holds both for exterior and interior mean-motion orbital resonances. Evolutions
of longitude of pericenter in the planar circular and elliptical restricted
three-body problems are shown. Our numerical integrations suggest that any
analytic expression for secular time derivative of the particle's longitude of
pericenter does not exist, if a dependence on semi-major axis, eccentricity and
longitude of pericenter is considered (the P-R effect and mean-motion resonance
with the planet in circular orbit is taken into account).
  Change of optical properties of the spherical grain with the heliocentric
distance is also considered. The change of the optical properties: i) does not
have any significant influence on secular evolution of eccentricity, ii) causes
that the shift of pericenter is mainly in the same direction/orientation as the
particle motion around the Sun. The statements hold both for circular and
noncircular planetary orbits.

nearly-Keplerian potential near a massive black hole (MBH). RR dominates the
dynamics of compact remnants that inspiral into a MBH and emit gravitational
waves (extreme mass ratio inspiral events, EMRIs). RR can either increase the
EMRI rate, or strongly suppress it, depending on its still poorly-determined
efficiency. We use small-scale Newtonian N-body simulations to measure the RR
efficiency and to explore its possible dependence on the stellar number density
profile around the MBH, and the mass-ratio between the MBH and a star (a
single-mass stellar population is assumed). We develop an efficient and robust
procedure for detecting and measuring RR in N-body simulations. We present a
suite of simulations with a range of stellar density profiles and mass-ratios,
and measure the mean RR efficiency in the near-Keplerian limit. We do not find
a statistically significant dependence on the density profile or the

evidence this short-range electrostatic force, the Madelung potential arising

force which is deduced can be split into two major contributions: the first
stands for the coupling between the microscopic structure of the tip apex and
the capacitor formed between the tip, the ionic crystal and the
counter-electrode; the second term depicts the influence of the Madelung
surface potential on the mesoscopic part of the tip, independently from its
microscopic structure. These short-range electrostatic forces are in the range
of ten pico-Newtons. When explicitly considering the crystal polarization, an
analytical expression of the bias voltage to be applied on the tip to
compensate for the local CPD, i.e. to cancel the short-range electrostatic
force, is derived. The compensated CPD has the lateral periodicity of the
Madelung surface potential. However, the strong dependence on the tip geometry,
the applied modulation voltage as well as the tip-sample distance, which can
even lead to an overestimation of the real surface potential, makes
quantitative KPFM measurements of the local CPD extremely difficult.

that we are not in a central, or otherwise special region of the Universe.
Studies of Type Ia supernovae, together with the Copernican Principle, have led
to the inference that the Universe is accelerating in its expansion. The usual
explanation for this is that there must exist a `Dark Energy', to drive the
acceleration. Alternatively, it could be the case that the Copernican Principle
is invalid, and that the data has been interpreted within an inappropriate
theoretical frame-work. If we were to live in a special place in the Universe,
near the centre of a void where the local matter density is low, then the
supernovae observations could be accounted for without the addition of dark
energy. We show that the local redshift dependence of the luminosity distance
can be used as a clear discriminant between these two paradigms. Future surveys
of Type Ia supernovae that focus on a redshift range of ~0.1-0.4 will be
ideally suited to test this hypothesis, and hence to observationally determine
the validity of the Copernican Principle on new scales, as well as probing the
degree to which dark energy must be considered a necessary ingredient in the

their spatial distributions and excitation conditions in the low-mass young
stellar objects IRAS 16293-2422 A and B. Methods: Interferometric observations
with the Submillimeter Array have been performed at 5''x3'' resolution
revealing emission lines of HNCO, CH3CN, CH2CO, CH3CHO and C2H5OH. Rotational
temperatures are determined from rotational diagrams when a sufficient number
of lines are detected. Results: Compact emission is detected for all species
studied here. For HNCO and CH3CN it mostly arises from source A, CH2CO and
C2H5OH have comparable strength for both sources and CH3CHO arises exclusively
from source B. HNCO, CH3CN and CH3CHO have rotational temperatures >200 K. The
(u,v)-visibility data reveal that HNCO also has extended cold emission.
Conclusions: The abundances of the molecules studied here are very similar
within factors of a few to those found in high-mass YSOs. Thus the chemistry
between high- and low-mass objects appears to be independent of luminosity and
cloud mass. Bigger abundance differences are seen between the A and B source.
The HNCO abundance relative to CH3OH is ~4 times higher toward A, which may be
due to a higher initial OCN- ice abundances in source A compared to B.
Furthermore, not all oxygen-bearing species are co-existent. The different
spatial behavior of CH2CO and C2H5OH compared with CH3CHO suggests that
hydrogenation reactions on grain-surfaces are not sufficient to explain the
observed gas phase abundances. Selective destruction of CH3CHO may result in
the anti-coincidence of these species in source A. These results illustrate the
power of interferometric compared with single dish data in terms of testing
chemical models.

uncorrelated scale-free networks and scale-free networks with assortative
degree correlations. We show that in both homogeneous networks and random
graphs the model exhibits a critical threshold in the rumour spreading rate
below which a rumour cannot propagate in the system. In the case of scale-free
networks, on the other hand, this threshold becomes vanishingly small in the
limit of infinite system size. We find that the initial rate at which a rumour
spreads is much higher in scale-free networks than in random graphs, and that
the rate at which the spreading proceeds on scale-free networks is further
increased when assortative degree correlations are introduced. The impact of
degree correlations on the final fraction of nodes that ever hears a rumour,
however, depends on the interplay between network topology and the rumour
spreading rate. Our results show that scale-free social networks are prone to
the spreading of rumours, just as they are to the spreading of infections. They

important charge carriers and play a large role in coupling the magnetic field
and flow of neutral gas. Some effects of the dust on the dynamics of oblique
shocks began to emerge in the 1990s. However, detailed models of these shocks
are required for the calculation of the grain sputtering contribution to gas
phase abundances of species producing observed emissions. We are developing
such models. Some of the molecular species introduced into the gas phase by
sputtering in shocks or by thermally driven desorption in hot cores form on
grain surfaces. Recently laboratory studies have begun to contribute to the
understanding of surface reactions and thermally driven desorption important
for the chemistry of star forming clouds. Dusty plasmas are prevalent in many
evolved stars just as well as in star forming regions. Radiation pressure on
dust plays a significant role in mass loss from some post-main-sequence stars.
The mechanisms leading to the formation of carbonaceous dust in the stellar
outflows are similar to those important for soot formation in flames. However,
nucleation in oxygen-rich outflows is less well understood and remains a
challenging research area. Dust is observed in supernova ejecta that have not
passed through the reverse shocks that develop in the interaction of ejecta
with ambient media. Dust is detected in high redshift galaxies that are
sufficiently young that the only stars that could have produced the dust were
so massive that they became supernovae. Consequently, the issue of the survival

multiband superconductors in the absence of anisotropy or spin-orbit

the Lefschetz number with the fixed point index. This identification is a
consequence of the functoriality of the trace in symmetric monoidal categories.
There are refinements of the Lefschetz number and the fixed point index that
give a converse to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. An important part of this
theorem is the identification of these different invariants. We define a
generalization of the trace in symmetric monoidal categories to a trace in
bicategories with shadows. We show the invariants used in the converse of the
Lefschetz fixed point theorem are examples of this trace and that the
functoriality of the trace provides some of the necessary identifications. The
methods used here do not use simplicial techniques and so generalize readily to
other contexts.

broad Ly alpha based on the theory of charge transfer reactions between ambient
hydrogen atoms and post-shock protons at a strong shock front. Results. We have
found that the broad Ly alpha line originated from the blast wave created by
the outburst, while the contemporary optical and UV lines arose from the nebula
downstream of the expanding shock in the colliding wind scenario.

radial profiles of intensity and colors. We find that only nine of the observed
galaxies have multi-band morphologies expected for the classical collisional
scenario of ring formation, indicating the high degree of contamination of the
ring galaxy sample by galaxies without a clear ring morphology. The radial
intensity profiles, obtained by masking the off-centered nucleus, peak at the
position of the ring, with the profiles in the continuum bands broader than
that in the Halpha line. The images as well as the radial intensity and color
profiles clearly demonstrate the existence of the pre-collisional stellar disk
outside the star-forming ring, which is in general bluer than the disk internal
to the ring. The stellar disk seems to have retained its size, with the disk
outside the ring having a shorter exponential scale length as compared to the
values expected in normal spiral galaxies of comparable masses. The rings in
our sample of galaxies are found to be located preferentially at around
half-way through the stellar disk. The most likely reason for this preference
is bias against detecting rings when they are close to the center (they would
be confused with the resonant rings), and at the edge of the disk the gas
surface density may be below the critical density required for star formation.
Most of the observed characteristics point to relatively recent collisions (<80
Myr ago) according to the N-body simulations of Gerber et al. (1996).

between SrMnO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ from density-functional calculations and
interpret the basic results in terms of a three-site Mn-O-Mn model. Magnetic
interaction between the Mn atoms is governed by a competition between the
antiferromagnetic superexchange of the Mn t$_{2g}$ core spins and the
ferromagnetic double exchange of the itinerant e$_g$ electrons. While the core
electrons are relatively unaffected by the strain, the orbital character of the
itinerant electron is strongly affected, which in turn causes a large change in
the strength of the ferromagnetic double exchange. The epitaxial strain
produces the tetragonal distortion of the MnO$_6$ octahedron, splitting the
Mn-e$_g$ states into x$^2$-y$^2$ and 3z$^2$-1 states, with the former being
lower in energy, if the strain is tensile in the plane, and opposite if the
strain is compressive. For the case of the tensile strain, the resulting higher
occupancy of the x$^2$-y$^2$ orbital enhances the in-plane ferromagnetic double
exchange owing to the larger electron hopping in the plane, causing at the same
time a reduction of the out-of-plane double exchange. This reduction is large
enough to be overcome by antiferromagnetic superexchange, which wins to produce
a net antiferromagnetic interaction between the out-of-plane Mn atoms. For the
case of the in-plane compressive strain, the reverse happens, viz., that the
higher occupancy of the 3z$^2$-1 orbital results in the out-of-plane
ferromagnetic interaction, while the in-plane magnetic interaction remains
antiferromagnetic. Concrete density-functional results are presented for the
(LaMnO$_3$)$_1$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_1$ and (LaMnO$_3$)$_1$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_3$
superlattices for various strain conditions.
