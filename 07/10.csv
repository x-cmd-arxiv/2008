recently been advocated that we live in a special place in the Universe near
the centre of a large void described by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric.
The Universe is no longer homogeneous and isotropic and the apparent late time
acceleration is actually a consequence of spatial gradients in the metric. If
we did not live close to the centre of the void, we would have observed a
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole much larger than that allowed by
observations. Hence, until now it has been argued, for the model to be
consistent with observations, that by coincidence we happen to live very close
to the centre of the void or we are moving towards it. However, even if we are
at the centre of the void, we can observe distant galaxy clusters, which are
off-centre. In their frame of reference there should be a large CMB dipole,
which manifests itself observationally for us as a kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(kSZ) effect. kSZ observations give far stronger constraints on the LTB model
compared to other observational probes such as Type Ia Supernovae, the CMB, and
baryon acoustic oscillations. We show that current observations of only 9
clusters with large error bars already rule out LTB models with void sizes
greater than approximately 1.5 Gpc and a significant underdensity, and that
near future kSZ surveys like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, South Pole
Telescope, APEX telescope, or the Planck satellite will be able to strongly
rule out or confirm LTB models with giga parsec sized voids. On the other hand,
if the LTB model is confirmed by observations, a kSZ survey gives a unique
possibility of directly reconstructing the expansion rate and underdensity
profile of the void.

gerbes. We also show how the 2-character of a 2-representation can be made
functorial with respect to morphisms of 2-representations. Under the geometric
correspondence, the 2-character of a 2-representation corresponds to the
geometric character of its associated equivariant gerbe. This enables us to
show that the complexified 2-character is a unitarily fully faithful functor
from the complexified homotopy category of unitary 2-representations to the

characterized by a Kasner-like expansion, which is driven dynamically towards
inflation by a scalar field. We investigate the evolution of linear metric
fluctuations around this background, and calculate the amplification of the
long-wavelength GW of a certain polarization during the anisotropic expansion
(this effect is absent for another GW polarization, and for scalar
fluctuations). These GW are superimposed to the usual tensor modes of quantum
origin from inflation, and are potentially observable if the total number of
inflationary e-folds exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable
universe only by a small margin. Their contribution to the temperature
anisotropy angular power spectrum decreases with the multipole l as l^(-p),
where p depends on the slope of the initial GW power-spectrum. Constraints on
the long-wavelength GW can be translated into limits on the total duration of
inflation and the initial GW amplitude. The instability of classical GW (and
zero-vacuum fluctuations of gravitons) during Kasner-like expansion (or
contraction) may have other interesting applications. In particular, if GW
become non-linear, they can significantly alter the geometry before the onset
of inflation.

Several arguments given in the literature suggest that, in this context, both
area and entropy should be quantized with an equally spaced spectrum for large
quantum numbers. But in more general theories (like, for e.g, in the black hole
solutions of Gauss-Bonnet or Lanczos-Lovelock gravity) the horizon entropy is
\emph{not} proportional to area and the question arises as to which of the two
(if at all) will have this property. We give a general argument that in all
Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity, it is the \emph{entropy} that has equally
spaced spectrum. In the case of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we use the asymptotic
form of quasi normal mode frequencies to explicitly demonstrate this result.
Hence, the concept of a quantum of area in Einstein Hilbert (EH) gravity needs
to be replaced by a concept of \emph{quantum of entropy} in a more general
context.

gravities log g between about 5.0 and 6.0 (cgs units). According to the
results, weak winds with mass-loss rates of the order E-11 solar masses per

the decoupling of the metals from the bulk matter (hydrogen and helium) is
expected in the wind region, because the momentum exchange via Coulomb

performance model is iteratively updated and used to guide selection on a
sequence of problem instances. The resulting exploration-exploitation trade-off
was represented as a bandit problem with expert advice, using an existing
solver for this game, but this required the setting of an arbitrary bound on
algorithm runtimes, thus invalidating the optimal regret of the solver. In this
paper, we propose a simpler framework for representing algorithm selection as a
bandit problem, with partial information, and an unknown bound on losses. We
adapt an existing solver to this game, proving a bound on its expected regret,
which holds also for the resulting algorithm selection technique. We present
preliminary experiments with a set of SAT solvers on a mixed SAT-UNSAT
benchmark.

dynamical model of Calogero type which yields the new chain in the large

showing that the level density is normally distributed even for a moderately

the distribution of normalized spacings between consecutive levels which fits
the numerical data with remarkable accuracy. Our results provide further
evidence that spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type are exceptional integrable

introduce the notion of a splicer, the union of spanning trees of a graph. We
prove that for any bounded-degree n-vertex graph, the union of two random
spanning trees approximates the expansion of every cut of the graph to within a
factor of O(log n). For the random graph G_{n,p}, for p> c log{n}/n, two
spanning trees give an expander. This is suggested by the case of the complete
graph, where we prove that two random spanning trees give an expander. The
construction of the splicer is elementary -- each spanning tree can be produced
independently using an algorithm by Aldous and Broder: a random walk in the
graph with edges leading to previously unvisited vertices included in the tree.
  A second important application of splicers is to graph sparsification where
the goal is to approximate every cut (and more generally the quadratic form of
the Laplacian) using only a small subgraph of the original graph.
Benczur-Karger as well as Spielman-Srivastava have shown sparsifiers with O(n
log n/eps^2)$ edges that achieve approximation within factors 1+eps and 1-eps.
Their methods, based on independent sampling of edges, need Omega(n log n)
edges to get any approximation (else the subgraph could be disconnected) and
leave open the question of linear-size sparsifiers. Splicers address this
question for random graphs by providing sparsifiers of size O(n) that
approximate every cut to within a factor of O(log n).

determination of experimental values of \alpha_s below 1GeV by comparison with

multi-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest having
three. In addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,
nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. We find that the velocity
maps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in the
transition regions between kinematic subcomponents. In terms of E/S0
classification, this means that 74% of Es and 92% of S0s have components with
disk-like kinematics. For the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axial
ratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary to
what is predicted with isotropic Jeans models viewed at different inclinations.
The position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly in
slow rotators. Velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similar
to the distribution of light. We constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - V/sigma
and h4 - V/sigma diagrams from SAURON observations. We confirm the classical
anti-correlation of h3 and V\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero in
some objects or even weakly correlated with V/sigma. The distribution of h4 for
fast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. The difference between
slow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the LOSVD, with
evidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likely
different evolutionary paths.

interspike-interval density of a continuously stimulated spiking neuron. The
model allows the conditional interspike-interval density and the stationary
interspike-interval density to be expressed as products of two separate
functions, one of which describes only the neuron characteristics, and the
other of which describes only the signal characteristics. This allows the use
of this model to predict the response when the underlying neuron model is not
known or well determined. The approximation shows particularly clearly that
signal autocorrelations and cross-correlations arise as natural features of the
interspike-interval density, and are particularly clear for small signals and
moderate noise. We show that this model simplifies the design of spiking neuron
cross-correlation systems, and describe a four-neuron mutual inhibition network
that generates a cross-correlation output for two input signals.

us to generate a sequence of traveling pulses of any desired length, using a
one-time initial stimulus. The wave trains are produced by a transient
pacemaker generated by a one-time suitably tailored spatially localized finite
amplitude stimulus, and belong to a family of fast pulse trains. A second
family, of slow pulse trains, is also present. The latter are created through a
clumping instability of a traveling wave state (in an excitable regime) and are
inaccessible to single localized stimuli of the type we use. The results
indicate that the presence of a large multiplicity of stable, accessible,
multi-pulse states is a general property of simple models of excitable media.

The energy diverges at $t=0$, for a generic state. In addition, if $p>1$ the
phase of the wave function has a wildly oscillating behavior, which does not
allow it to be continued past $t=0$. A similar effect would make the gauge
theory singular as well, though nontrivial effects of renormalization could
tame this singularity and allow a smooth continuation beyond $t=0$. The gravity
dual in some cases is known to be a time dependent cosmology which exhibits a
space-like singularity at $t=0$. Our results, if applicable in the gauge theory

sickness and does not admit a meaningful continuation. When the coupling
remains non-zero and becomes small at $t=0$, the curvature in the bulk becomes
of order the string scale. The gauge theory now admits a time evolution beyond

is to consider curvature corrections to the Penrose limit giving an expansion
in 1/J, the other by considering a low energy expansion in lambda'=lambda/J^2
of the string theory sigma-model, lambda being the 't Hooft coupling of the

use zeta-function regularization in order to compute the 1/J correction to the

non-trivial coupling to a non-dynamical transverse direction. We find agreement

signal, with the optical peak lagging X-rays by ~ 150 ms, preceded by a shallow
rise and followed by a steep decline along with broad anti-correlation dips.
Examination of the light curves shows that the main CCF features are reproduced

auto-correlation function (ACF) is broader than the optical ACF, arguing
against reprocessing as the origin for the rapid optical emission. X-ray
flaring is associated with spectral hardening, but no corresponding changes are

spherical silver particles prepared by rapid mixing of ascorbic acid and
silver-amine complex solutions in the absence of a dispersing agent. Using an
accelerated integration scheme to speed up the calculation of particle size
distributions in the latter stages, we find that the recently reported
experimental results -- some of which are summarized here -- can be modeled
effectively by the two-stage formation mechanism used previously to model the
preparation of uniform gold spheres. We treat both the equilibrium
concentration of silver atoms and the surface tension of silver precursor
nanocrystals as free parameters, and find that the experimental reaction time
scale is fit by a narrow region of this two-parameter space. The kinetic
parameter required to quantitatively match the final particle size is found to
be very close to that used previously in modeling the formation of gold
particles, suggesting that similar kinetics governs the aggregation process and
providing evidence that the two-stage model of burst nucleation of
nanocrystalline precursors followed by their aggregation to form the final
colloids can be applied to systems both with and without dispersing agents. The
model also reproduced semiquantitatively the effects of solvent viscosity and
temperature on the particle preparation.

AGN activity in B2 0648+27, based on its unusual multi-wavelength properties
(large-scale HI ring, dominating post-starburst stellar population and
infra-red luminosity). In this Research Note we present deep optical B- and
V-band imaging that provides further evidence for the merger origin of B2
0648+27. The host galaxy shows a distorted optical morphology and a broad tidal
arm is clearly present. A low surface-brightness stellar tail or partial ring
curls around more than half the host galaxy at a distance of up to 55 kpc from
the centre of the galaxy, following the large-scale, ring-like HI structure
that we detected previously around this system. The gas and stars in this ring
are most likely tidally expelled material that slowly fell back onto the host
galaxy after the merger event. There also appear to be sites of star formation
in the HI ring that may have formed within the gaseous tidal debris after the
merger. We argue that the observed properties of the gas and stars in B2
0648+27, as well as the apparent time-delay between the merger and the
starburst event, may be the logical result of a merger between two gas-rich
disk galaxies with a prominent bulge, or of a merger between an elliptical and
a gas-rich spiral galaxy. There also appears to be a significant time-delay
between the merger/starburst event and the current episode of radio-AGN
activity.

field operators in a reasonable quantum field theory cannot be unitary. Here,
the original requirement of unitarity is revisited from a physical point of
view to show not only that unitarity is not required but indeed not possible.
Electrodynamics is used as an example. In a classical treatment the interaction
cannot be turned on or off adiabatically as energy conservation cannot be
maintained in a physically meaningful way. In a fully second quantized theory
the interaction (or source) term is always present in the equation of motion
even if the system is in the vacuum state. So, the interaction cannot be
physically turned on or off adiabatically or otherwise. Hence, the
transformation V(t) from free fields to interacting fields cannot be
interpreted as an actual time evolution. This makes the unitarity of V(t)quite
unnecessary as the original reason for unitarity was to conserve probability
(or energy) through a time evolution. It is conjectured that the infinite terms
in the scattering matrix that need renormalization appear due to the forcing of
V(t)to be unitary. An alternate approach to scattering of interacting fields is
suggested.

represent a class of accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we have
undertaken a program to identify ULXs and a lower luminosity X-ray comparison
sample with the highest quality data in the {\it Chandra} archive. We establish
as a general property of ULXs that the most X-ray-luminous objects possess the
flattest X-ray spectra (in the {\it Chandra} bandpass). No prior sample studies
have established the general hardening of ULX spectra with luminosity. This
hardening occurs at the highest luminosities (absorbed luminosity
$\geq5\times10^{39}$~erg~s$^{-1}$) and is in line with recent models arguing
that ULXs are actually stellar-mass black holes. From spectral modeling, we
show that the evidence originally taken to mean that ULXs are IMBHs - i.e., the
""simple IMBH model"" - is nowhere near as compelling when a large sample of ULXs
is looked at properly. During the last couple of years, {\it XMM-Newton}
spectroscopy of ULXs has to a large extent begun to negate the simple IMBH
model based on fewer objects. We confirm and expand these results, which
validates the {\it XMM-Newton} work in a broader sense with independent X-ray
data. We find that (1) cool-disk components are present with roughly equal
probability and total flux fraction for any given ULX, regardless of
luminosity, and (2) cool-disk components extend below the standard ULX
luminosity cutoff of 10$^{39}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, down to our sample limit of
10$^{38.3}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. The fact that cool disk components are not correlated
with luminosity damages the argument that cool disks indicate IMBHs in ULXs,
for which strong statistical support was never found.

method is based on representing the free energy and surface pressure in terms
of certain marginal probabilities in a suitably modified sublattice of $\Z^d$.
Then recent deterministic algorithms for computing marginal probabilities are
used to obtain numerical estimates of the quantities of interest. The method
works under the assumption of Strong Spatial Mixing (SSP), which is a form of a
correlation decay.
  We illustrate our method for the hard-core and monomer-dimer models, and
improve several earlier estimates. For example we show that the exponent of the
monomer-dimer coverings of $\Z^3$ belongs to the interval $[0.78595,0.78599]$,
improving best previously known estimate of (approximately) $[0.7850,0.7862]$

computational effort of our method for these two models is
$(1/\epsilon)^{O(1)}$ \emph{both} for free energy and surface pressure. In
contrast, prior methods, such as transfer matrix method, require

larger depths resulting in a decreased probability for the photons to scatter
back out of the atmosphere before being absorbed. The increased depth of
penetration of starlight in a 3D medium is a well known result from theoretical
studies of molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres. For the first time we

However, under mixed-mode loading condition, the dependence of loading capacity
on the thickness becomes very weak. Although the measured crack initiation
angles from the mid-plane of the fractured specimens coincide well with typical
existed criteria in the thin and thick specimens under all the mixed-mode

significantly with specimen thickness and loading mode. The ductile dimples in
the crack initiation zone become larger and shallower as the specimen thickness
decreasing.

graphene at low temperatures under far- and mid-infrared (IR) radiation in a
wide range of its intensities. The energy distributions of carriers are
calculated using a quasiclassic kinetic equation which accounts for the energy
relaxation due to acoustic phonons and the radiative generation-recombination
processes associated with thermal radiation and the carrier photoexcitation by
incident radiation. It is found that the nonequilibrium distributions are
determined by an interplay between weak energy relaxation on acoustic phonons
and generation-recombination processes as well as by the effect of pumping
saturation. Due to the effect of saturation, the carrier distribution functions
can exhibit plateaus around the pumping region at elevated intensities. As
shown, at sufficiently strong mid-IR pumping, the population inversion can
occur below the pumping energy. The graphene dc conductivity as a function of
the pumping intensity exhibits a pronounced nonlinearity with a sub-linear
region at fairly low intensities and a saturation at a strong pumping. However,
an increase in the pumping intensity in very wide range leads only to a modest
increase in the carrier concentration and, particularly, the dc conductivity.
The graphene conductivity at mid-IR irradiation exhibit strong sensitivity to
mechanisms of carrier momentum relaxation.

pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous space, we define another complexification and a
(complete) anti-Kaehler metric on the complexification. One of main purposes of
this paper is to find the interesting relation between these two
complexifications (equipped with the anti-Kaehler metrics) of a
pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous space. Another of main purposes of this paper is
to show that almost all principal orbits of some isometric action on the first

photon interactions occurring at energies well beyond the electroweak energy
scale. Hence, the LHC can to some extend be considered as a high-energy
photon-photon or photon-proton collider. This offers a unique possibility for
novel and complementary research where the available effective luminosity is
small, relative to parton-parton interactions, but it is compensated by better
known initial conditions and usually simpler final states. This is in a way a
method for approaching some of the issues to be addressed by the future lepton
collider. Such studies of photon interactions are possible at the LHC, thanks
to the striking experimental signatures of events involving photon exchanges,
in particular the presence of very forward scattered protons.

produce a probability density function of the field strengths associated with
such elements. The dynamics of the magnetic field are simulated through a
numerical model in which magnetic elements are passively driven by an advection
field presenting spatio-temporal correlations which mimicks the granulation and
the mesogranulation scales observed on the solar surface. The field strength
can increase due to an amplification process which takes place where the
magnetic elements converge. Starting from a delta-like probability density
function centered on B=30 G, we obtain magnetic field strengths up to 2 kG (in
absolute value). To derive the statistical properties of the magnetic elements
several simulation runs are performed. The model is able to produce kG magnetic
fields in a time interval of the order of the granulation time scale. The mean
unsigned flux density and the mean magnetic energy density of the synthetic
quiet Sun reach respectively 100 G and 350 G in the stationary regime. The
derived probability density function of the magnetic field strength decreases
rapidly from B=30 G to B=100 G and presents a secondary maximum for B=2 kG.
  From this result it follows that magnetic fields >700 G dominate the unsigned
flux density and magnetic energy density although the probability density
function of the field strength presents a maximum for B=30 G.

the self-focusing effect the electron moves in a compact wave packet. The
spin-orbit coupling translates the spatial motion of the electron into the
rotations of the spin. The device does not require microwave radiation and
operates using low constant voltages. It is therefore suitable for selective
single-spin rotations in larger registers.

Piatetski-Shapiro in 1954 for the space $c_0$. The approach we developed also
enabled us to get a result in the second mentioned area, which a priori does
not look connected with the first one. The result (maybe, a bit surprising) is:
one cannot characterize the functions in $\ell_p(\Z)$ or $L^p(\R)$, $1 < p <

transform. This should be contrasted against the classical Wiener theorems
related to the cases $p=1,2$.

recessions arising in one or more countries might percolate across a network of
connected economies. A heterogeneous agent based model is set up in which the
agents are Western economies. A country has a probability of entering a
recession in any given year and one of emerging from it the next. In addition,
the agents have a unique threshold propensity to import a recession from the
agents with which they have the strongest connections. They are connected on a
small world topology, and an agent's neighbours at any time are either in
(state 1) or out (state 0) of recession. If the weighted sum exceeds the
threshold, the agent goes into recession. Annual real GDP growth for 17 Western
countries 1871-2006 is used as the data set. The distribution of the number of
countries in recession in any given year is exponential, as is the duration of
recessions within individual countries. The model is calibrated against these
two facts, plus the 'wait time' between recessions. It is able to replicate
them successfully. The network structure is essential for the agents to
replicate the stylised facts. The country-specific probabilities of entering
and emerging from recession by themselves give results very different to the
actual data.

has entered a 'golden age', in which high-precision observational data have
confirmed with startling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a phase of
accelerated expansion. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have
been proposed in the literature, in particular, dark energy models and modified
gravity, amongst others. One is liable to ask: What is the so-called 'dark
energy' that is driving the acceleration of the universe? Is it a vacuum energy
or a dynamical field (''quintessence'')? Or is the acceleration due to
infra-red modifications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity? In the
context of dark matter, two observations, namely, the behavior of the galactic
rotation curves and the mass discrepancy in galactic clusters, suggest the
existence of a (non or weakly interacting) form of dark matter at galactic and
extra-galactic scales. It has also been proposed that modified gravity can
explain the galactic dynamics without the need of introducing dark matter. We
briefly review some of the modified theories of gravity that address these two
intriguing and exciting problems facing modern physics.

implement, from the very start, the minimum redundancy combination in a nearest
neighbor scheme of six telescopes over six baselines, thus offering better
options for rejection of large intensity or phase fluctuations over each beam,
due to the symmetric set-up. The planar geometry solution of the FT beam
combiner is devised to be easily scalable either to four or eight telescopes,

magnetization for instance, can in principle be described by statistics of sums
of (possibly correlated) random variables. Yet, it turns out that extreme
values (the largest value among a set of random variables) may also play a role
in the statistics of global quantities, in a direct or indirect way. This
review discusses different connections that may appear between problems of sums
and of extreme values of random variables, and emphasizes physical situations
in which such connections are relevant. Along this line of thought, standard
convergence theorems for sums and extreme values of independent and identically
distributed random variables are recalled, and some rigorous results as well as
more heuristic reasonings are presented for correlated or non-identically
distributed random variables. More specifically, the role of extreme values
within sums of broadly distributed variables is addressed, and a general
mapping between extreme values and sums is presented, allowing us to identify a
class of correlated random variables whose sum follows (generalized) extreme
value distributions. Possible applications of this specific class of random
variables are illustrated on the example of two simple physical models. A few
extensions to other related classes of random variables sharing similar
qualitative properties are also briefly discussed, in connection with the
so-called BHP distribution.

simulations are carried out at the lattice spacing of $a=0.0907(13)$fm on a
$32^3\times 64$ lattice with the use of the DDHMC algorithm to reduce the
up-down quark mass. Further algorithmic improvements make possible the
simulation whose ud quark mass is as light as the physical value. The resulting
PS meson masses range from 702MeV down to 156MeV, which clearly exhibit the
presence of chiral logarithms. An analysis of the PS meson sector with SU(3)
ChPT reveals that the NLO corrections are large at the physical strange quark
mass. In order to estimate the physical ud quark mass, we employ the SU(2)
chiral analysis expanding the strange quark contributions analytically around
the physical strange quark mass. The SU(2) LECs ${\bar l}_3$ and ${\bar l}_4$
are comparable with the recent estimates by other lattice QCD calculations. We
determine the physical point together with the lattice spacing employing
$m_\pi$, $m_K$ and $m_\Omega$ as input. The hadron spectrum extrapolated to the
physical point shows an agreement with the experimental values at a few % level
of statistical errors, albeit there remain possible cutoff effects. We also
find that our results of $f_\pi=134.0(4.2)$MeV, $f_K=159.4(3.1)$MeV and
$f_K/f_\pi=1.189(20)$ with the perturbative renormalization factors are

orbit periods of less than 3 years. SIM-Lite will also perform global
astrometry on a variety of astrophysics objects, reaching 4.5 micro-arc-seconds
absolute position and parallax measurements. As a pointed instrument, SIM-Lite
will be capable of achieving 8 micro-arc-second astrometric accuracy on 19th

matter physics and in quantum information science. In condensed matter systems,
the subsystems are examined traditionally by using the Green function and
mean-field-like methods based on the Heisenberg representation. In quantum
information science, the subsystems are handled by composite density matrix,
its marginals describing the subsystems, and the Kraus representation to
elucidate the subsystem properties. In this work, a relationship is first
established between the two techniques which appear to be distinct at first
sight. This will be illustrated in detail by presenting the two methods in the
case of the celebrated exactly soluable Jaynes - Cummings model (1963) of a
two-state atom interacting with a one-mode quantized electromagnetic field. The
dynamics of this system was treated in the Heisenberg representation by
Ackerhalt and Rzazewski (1975). We present here the corresponding subdynamics
using Kraus representation. A relationship between the two approaches is
established and the relative merits of the two techniques are discussed in
elucidating the distinctive features of the subdynamics. The striking effects
of interaction and entanglement are made transparent in two illustrative
examples: the transformations that manifest in non-interacting number and spin
representations due to interactions in their respective subspaces.

favor d-wave singlet superconductivity in the cuprates but s-wave singlet in
the pnictides. This difference arises from the existence of a large on-site
repulsion between carriers in the cuprates largely absent in the pnictides.
Fluorine is responsible for raising Tc significantly in some pnictides and in
the cuprates to 155K-168K, the highest achieved at ambient pressure. We propose
an experimental procedure for finding and fabricating the fluorinated cuprate
phase having that exceptional property.

for any real-valued function f on the cube holds E(f,f) \ge 2 Ent(f^2), where
E(f,f) is the appropriate Dirichlet form (also known as ""sum of influences"").
  We show that the constant C = 2 at the right hand side of this inequality can

function C is an increasing convex function taking [0,log 2] to [2, 2/log 2].
  We present some applications of this modified inequality. In particular, it
is used to obtain a discrete version of the Faber-Krahn inequality for small
subsets of the Hamming cube, answering a question of Friedman and Tillich. We
introduce, following the approach of Friedman and Tillich, the notion of a
fractional edge-boundary size of a subset of {0,1}^n, and show Hamming balls of

Brownian particle between local minima in a potential landscape. In the
weak-noise limit, the transition time is to leading order exponential in the
potential difference to overcome. This exponential is corrected by a prefactor
which depends on the principal curvatures of the potential at the starting
minimum and at the highest saddle crossed by an optimal transition path. The
Eyring-Kramers law, however, does not hold whenever one of these principal
curvatures vanishes, since it would predict a vanishing or infinite transition
time. We derive the correct prefactor up to multiplicative errors that tend to
one in the zero-noise limit. As an illustration, we discuss the case of a
symmetric pitchfork bifurcation, in which the prefactor can be expressed in
terms of modified Bessel functions, as well as bifurcations with two vanishing
eigenvalues. The corresponding transition times are studied in a full
neighbourhood of the bifurcation point. These results extend work by Bovier,
Eckhoff, Gayrard and Klein, who rigorously analysed the case of quadratic
saddles, using methods from potential theory.

excitation function determined for the pp-->ppK+K- reaction revealed a
statistically significant enhancement close to the threshold which may
plausibly be assigned to the influence of the K-p interaction. In addition,
observed consistently by both groups, a strong enhancement at low values of the

local peak at T around 140K due to the establishment of a long range
antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe moments in Fe-As layers. This feature has
already been observed with different techniques, and frequently ascribed to the
onset of a Spin Density Wave (SDW). At TN around 6K another peak, which we
attribute to the establishment of antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm ion
sublattice, is observed. Furthermore, a temperature independent signal (Pauli
paramagnetism, Landau and core diamagnetism...) is also present in the magnetic
behaviour of this sample. In SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) the antiferromagnetic ordering
in Fe-As plane is suppressed and superconductivity occurs at T = 52 K, whereas
the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm ions at low temperature persists, leading
to the coexistence and competition between superconducting and magnetic
orderings. Above the transition temperature, after the subtraction of the Sm
ion sublattice paramagnetic contribution and of the temperature independent
contribution to the experimental susceptibility data, a Curie-Weiss behaviour
for Fe is observed, with a magnetic moment of 1.4 Bohr magneton.
