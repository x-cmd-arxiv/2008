The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not
available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code
combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations
of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its
user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that
the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the
priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on
semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel
rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength
regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties
are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q_z, that provides a
robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate.
Despite the fact that EAZY is not ""trained"" on spectroscopic samples, the code
(with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For
K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter
in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for
the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.

have compiled R'_HK data from the literature for young stellar clusters, richly

Combining the cluster activity data with modern cluster age estimates, and
analyzing the color-dependence of the chromospheric activity age index, we
derive an improved activity-age calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs (0.5 < B-V < 0.9

that relies on conversion of R'_HK values through the Rossby number to rotation
periods, and then makes use of improved gyrochronology relations. We
demonstrate that our new activity-age calibration has typical age precision of
~0.2 dex for normal solar-type dwarfs aged between the Hyades and the Sun

for some color-dependent effects, and systematically improves the age estimates

perturbatively represent the minimal bimetric model, where the bi-scalar is
Klein-Gordon in the matter frame. But the full non-perturbative bimetric

cosmological constant in the matter frame, balanced by an opposite cosmological
constant in the gravity frame. Thus the problem of structure formation receives
an elegant and universal solution within bimetric VSL theories, which are known

theory which displays gauge chiral symmetry. Quantum mechanically, functional
integration of the fermions yields the determinant of the Dirac operator, known
as the chiral determinant. Its modulus is chiral invariant but not so its
phase, which carries the chiral anomaly through the Wess-Zumino-Witten term.
Here we find the remarkable result that, upon removal from the chiral
determinant of this known anomalous part, the remaining chiral invariant factor
is just the square root of the determinant of a local covariant operator of the
Klein-Gordon type. This procedure bypasses the integrability obstruction
allowing to write down a functional that correctly reproduces both the modulus
and the phase of the chiral determinant. The technique is illustrated by
computing the effective action in two dimensions at leading order in the
derivative expansion. The results previously obtained by indirect methods are
indeed reproduced.

mechanism controlling the kinetics of allosteric transitions using a
variational model inspired from work in protein folding. The striking
differences in the predicted transition mechanism for the opening of the two
domains of calmodulin (CaM) emphasizes that inherent flexibility is key to
understanding the complex conformational changes that occur in proteins. In
particular, the C-terminal domain of CaM (cCaM) which is inherently less
flexible than its N-terminal domain (nCaM) reveals ""cracking"" or local partial
unfolding during the open/closed transition. This result is in harmony with the
picture that cracking relieves local stresses due to conformational
deformations of a sufficiently rigid protein. We also compare the
conformational transition in a recently studied ""even-odd"" paired fragment of
CaM. Our results rationalize the different relative binding affinities of the
EF-hands in the engineered fragment compared to the intact ""odd-even"" paired
EF-hands (nCaM and cCaM) in terms of changes in flexibility along the
transition route. Aside from elucidating general theoretical ideas about the
cracking mechanism, these studies also emphasize how the remarkable intrinsic
plasticity of CaM underlies conformational dynamics essential for its diverse
functions.

  We show via dynamical calculations for diamond, Si, and Fe that the dynamical
theory well predicts available current data for lower energies around 1 keV,
and that the patterns for energies above about 1 keV are dominated by Kikuchi
bands which are created by the dynamical scattering of electrons from lattice
planes. The origin of the fine structure in such bands is discussed from the
point of view of atomic positions in the unit cell. The profiles and positions
of the element-specific photoelectron Kikuchi bands are found to be sensitive
to lattice distortions (e.g. a 1% tetragonal distortion) and the position of
impurities or dopants with respect to lattice sites. We also compare the
dynamical calculations to results from a cluster model that is more often used
to describe lower-energy XPD. We conclude that hard XPD (HXPD) should be
capable of providing unique bulk-sensitive structural information for a wide

Observatory Synthesis Telescope radio data was performed for 13 small regions
along the bright northeastern rim of the supernova remnant SN 1006. These data
were fitted with a synchrotron radiation model. The nonthermal electron
spectrum used to compute the photon emission spectra is the traditional
exponentially cut off power law, with one notable difference: The power-law
index is not a constant. It is a linear function of the logarithm of the
momentum. This functional form enables us to show, for the first time, that the
synchrotron spectrum of SN 1006 seems to flatten with increasing energy. The
effective power-law index of the electron spectrum is 2.2 at 1 GeV (i.e., radio
synchrotron-emitting momenta) and 2.0 at about 10 TeV (i.e., X-ray
synchrotron-emitting momenta). This amount of change in the index is
qualitatively consistent with theoretical models of the amount of curvature in
the proton spectrum of the remnant. The evidence of spectral curvature implies
that cosmic rays are dynamically important instead of being ""test"" particles.
The spectral analysis also provides a means of determining the critical
frequency of the synchrotron spectrum associated with the highest-energy
electrons. The critical frequency seems to vary along the northeastern rim,
with a maximum value of 1.1e17 (0.6e17 - 2.1e17) Hz. This value implies that
the electron diffusion coefficient can be no larger than a factor of ~4.5-21
times the Bohm diffusion coefficient if the velocity of the forward shock is in
the range 2300-5000 km/s. Since the coefficient is close to the Bohm limit,
electrons are accelerated nearly as fast as possible in the regions where the

MOSFET performance. We found that MR saturates at a lower value for smaller

found to be more detrimental to MR than that at the injector side, for drain
bias less than the energy difference of the minority spin edge and the Fermi

An effect of the damage was to increase the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI)
of the front illuminated CCDs. As part of the initial damage assessment, the
focal plane was warmed from the operating temperature of -100C to +30C which
unexpectedly further increased the CTI. We report results of ACIS CCD

from 100 keV to 400 keV, and then subjected to simulated bakeouts in one of

them to our previous experiences on the ground and in flight, and derive limits

reach millions in a decade. Well-analyzed EBs are a prime source of
astrophysical information whose growth rate is at present limited by the need
for human interaction with each EB data-set, principally in determining a
starting solution for subsequent rigorous analysis. We describe the artificial

e cos(omega), and sin i) for each input light curve data-set. The whole sample

both the Paschen and Brackett series as well as the BrG/Pan line ratios. A
comparison of observed line ratio values was made to those predicted by the
temperature and electron density dependent models of Case B hydrogen
recombination line theory. The measured line ratios are statistically well-fit
by a tightly constrained range of temperatures (T < 2000 K) and electron
densities 1e9 < n_e < 1e10 cm^-3. A comparison of the observed line ratio
values to the values predicted by the optically thick and thin local
thermodynamic equilibrium cases rules out these conditions for the emitting H I

recombining gas. While the range of electron densities is consistent with the
gas densities predicted by existing magnetospheric accretion models, the
temperature range constrained by the Case B comparison is considerably lower
than that expected for accreting gas. The cooler gas temperatures will require
a non-thermal excitation process (e.g., coronal/accretion-related X-rays and UV

study how the outcome of fragmentation depends upon numerical resolution and
cooling time, and to investigate the incidence of binary formation within
fragmenting discs. We investigate a range of cooling times, from the relatively
long cooling time-scales that are marginally unstable to fragmentation down to
highly unstable cooling on a time-scale that is shorter than the local
dynamical time. The characteristic mass of fragments decreases with reduced
cooling time, though the effect is modest and dependent upon details of how
rapidly bound clumps radiate. We observe a high incidence of capture binaries,
though we are unable to determine their final orbits or probability of
survival. The results suggest that faster cooling in the parent disc results in
an increased binary fraction, and that a high primordial binary fraction may
result from disc fragmentation. We discuss our results in terms of the young
massive stars close to the Galactic Centre, and suggest that observations of
some stellar binaries close to the Galactic Centre remain consistent with
formation in a fragmenting accretion disc.

include effects of both biasing and redshift-space distortions, which are
inevitable in predicting observable quantities in galaxy surveys. The precise
determination of scales of baryon acoustic oscillations is crucial to
investigate the nature of dark energy by galaxy surveys. We find that a local
Lagrangian bias and redshift-space distortions are naturally incorporated in
our formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique via the
Lagrangian picture. Our formalism is applicable to any biasing scheme which is
local in Lagrangian space, including the halo bias as a special case. Weakly
nonlinear effects on halo clustering in redshift space are analytically
given.We assume only a fundamental idea of the halo model: haloes form
according to the extended Press-Schechter theory, and the spatial distributions
are locally biased in Lagrangian space. There is no need for assuming the
spherical collapse model to follow the dynamical evolution, which is
additionally assumed in standard halo prescriptions. One-loop corrections to
the power spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are
explicitly derived and presented. Instead of relying on expensive numerical
simulations, our approach provides an analytic way of investigating the weakly
nonlinear effects, simultaneously including the nonlinear biasing and nonlinear
redshift-space distortions. Nonlinearity introduces a weak scale dependence in
the halo bias. The scale dependence is a smooth function in Fourier space, and
the bias does not critically change the feature of baryon acoustic oscillations
in the power spectrum. The same feature in the correlation function is less
affected by nonlinear effects of biasing.

spatial distribution of these stars, their distribution in radial velocity
reveals two moving groups. These results are reinforced when the sample is
combined with a sample of blue horizontal branch stars that were identified in
the SDSS, and the combined sample provides evidence for one additional moving
group. These groups correspond to peaks in the radial velocity distribution of
a sample of F type main-sequence stars that was recently observed in the same

metallicity, which is more consistent with it being the debris from a destroyed

radial velocities that are similar to the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) that was
identified previously in a fainter sample of RRLS. Our results suggest that
this feature extends to distances as short as ~12 kpc from its previous

These galaxies scatter along a tight sequence in the Kormendy relation. Around
one-third of the massive red objects are extraordinarily compact, with
effective radii under one kiloparsec. Our NICMOS observations allow the
detection of such systems more robustly than is possible with optical
(rest-frame UV) data, and while similar systems have been seen at z>2, this is
the first time such systems have been detected in a rest-frame optical survey
at 1.3<z<2. We refer to these compact galaxies as ""red nuggets"". Similarly
compact massive galaxies are completely absent in the nearby Universe. We
introduce a new ""stellar mass Kormendy relation"" (stellar mass density vs size)
which isolates the effects of size evolution from those of luminosity and color
evolution. The 1.1 < z < 2 passive galaxies have mass densities that are an
order of magnitude larger then early type galaxies today and are comparable to
the compact distant red galaxies at 2 < z < 3. We briefly consider mechanisms
for size evolution in contemporary models focusing on equal-mass mergers and
adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss. Neither of these mechanisms
appears able to transform the high-redshift Kormendy relation into its local
counterpart. <ABRIDGED>

broad red-shifted wings indicative of disturbance by protostellar outflows from

oblivious robot networks namely gathering and scattering. These abstractions
are fundamental coordination problems in cooperative mobile robotics. Moreover,
their oblivious characteristics makes them appealing for self-stabilization
since they are self-stabilizing with no extra-cost. Given a set of robots with
arbitrary initial location and no initial agreement on a global coordinate
system, gathering requires that all robots reach the exact same but not
predetermined location while scattering aims at scatter robots such that no two
robots share the same location. Both deterministic gathering and scattering
have been proved impossible under arbitrary schedulers therefore probabilistic
solutions have been recently proposed. The contribution of this paper is
twofold. First, we propose a detailed complexity analysis of the existent
probabilistic gathering algorithms in both fault-free and fault-prone
environments. We consider both crash and byzantine-prone environments.
Moreover, using Markov chains tools and additional assumptions on the
environment we prove that the gathering convergence time can be reduced from
O(n^2) (the best known tight bound) to O(nln(n)). Additionally, we prove that
in crash-prone environments gathering is achieved in O(nln(n)+2f). Second,
using the same technique we prove that the best known scattering strategy
converges in fault-free systems is O(n) (which is one to optimal) while in
crash-prone environments it needs O(n-f). Finally, we conclude the paper with a
discussion related to different strategies to gather oblivious robots.

the scenario of mass transfer from a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
primary to a low-mass companion in a binary system. We explore the extent to
which material accreted from a companion star becomes mixed with that of the
recipient, focusing on the effects of thermohaline mixing and gravitational
settling. We have created a new set of asymptotic giant branch models in order
to determine what the composition of material being accreted in these systems
will be. We then model a range of CEMP systems by evolving a grid of models of
low-mass stars, varying the amount of material accreted by the star (to mimic
systems with different separations) and also the composition of the accreted
material (to mimic accretion from primaries of different mass). We find that
with thermohaline mixing alone, the accreted material can become mixed with
between 16 and 88 per cent of the pristine stellar material of the accretor,
depending on the mass accreted and the composition of the material. If we
include the effects of gravitational settling, we find that thermohaline mixing
can be inhibited and, in the case that only a small quantity of material is
accreted, can be suppressed almost completely.

of preventive health science. Using as an example a human knee joint, this
paper proposes a new coupled-loading-rate hypothesis, which states that a
generic cause of any musculo-skeletal injury is a Euclidean jolt, or
SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that hits a joint in several coupled
degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. Informally, it is a rate-of-change of joint
acceleration in all 6-degrees-of-freedom simultaneously, times the
corresponding portion of the body mass. In the case of a human knee, this
happens when most of the body mass is on one leg with a semi-flexed knee -- and
then, caused by some external shock, the knee suddenly `jerks'; this can happen
in running, skiing, sports games (e.g., soccer, rugby) and various
crashes/impacts. To show this formally, based on the previously defined
covariant force law and its application to traumatic brain injury (Ivancevic,
2008), we formulate the coupled Newton--Euler dynamics of human joint motions
and derive from it the corresponding coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics of the joint
in case. The SE(3)-jolt is the main cause of two forms of discontinuous joint
injury: (i) mild rotational disclinations and (ii) severe translational
dislocations. Both the joint disclinations and dislocations, as caused by the
SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum
joint model.

accretional or disruptive in turbulent disks, through analytical arguments
based on fluid dynamical simulations and orbital integrations. In turbulent
disks, the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is pumped up by random
gravitational perturbations from density fluctuations of the disk gas. When the
velocity dispersion is larger than the planetesimals' surface escape velocity,
collisions between planetesimals do not result in accretion, and may even lead
to their destruction. In disks with a surface density equal to that of the
``minimum mass solar nebula'' and with nominal MRI turbulence, we find that
accretion proceeds only for planetesimals with sizes above $\sim 300$ km at 1AU
and $\sim 1000$ km at 5AU. We find that accretion is facilitated in disks with
smaller masses. However, at 5AU and for nominal turbulence strength, km-sized
planetesimals are in a highly erosive regime even for a disk mass as small as a
fraction of the mass of Jupiter. The existence of giant planets implies that
either turbulence was weaker than calculated by standard MRI models or some
mechanism was capable of producing Ceres-mass planetesimals in very short
timescales. In any case, our results show that in the presence of turbulence
planetesimal accretion is most difficult in massive disks and at large orbital
distances.

change in the net amount of 24 micron extended emission is observed between the

V838 Mon has experienced a new circumstellar dust creation event. We suggest
that this newly created dust has condensed from the expanding ejecta produced
from V838 Mon's 2002 outburst events, and is most likely clumpy. We speculate
that one (or more) of these clumps might have passed through the line-of-sight

by Bond (2006) and Munari et al (2007). We detect no evidence of extended

radial distances of 1860 - 93000 AU (0.3-15.0 arcsec) from the central source.

Herbig Ae star HD 163296, based on coronagraphic observations from the Hubble
Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Radial profile fits of the
surface brightness along the disk's semi-major axis indicates that the disk is
not continuously flared, and extends to 540 AU. The disk's color (V-I)=1.1 at a
radial distance of 3.5 arcseconds is redder than the observed stellar color
(V-I)=0.15. This red disk color might be indicative of either an evolution in
the grain size distribution (i.e. grain growth) and/or composition, both of
which would be consistent with the observed non-flared geometry of the outer
disk. We also identify a single ansa morphological structure in our F435W ACS
data, which is absent from earlier epoch F606W and F814W ACS data, but
corresponds to one of the two ansa observed in archival HST STIS coronagraphic
data.
  Following transformation to similar band-passes, we find that the scattered
light disk of HD 163296 is 1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ fainter at 3.5 arcseconds in the

visibility of the ansa(e) structures, in (ii) the relative surface brightness
of the ansa(e) structures, and in (iii) the (known) intrinsic polarization of
the system. These results indicate that the scattered light from the HD 163296
disk is variable. We speculate that the inner disk wall, which Sitko et al.

induces variable self-shadowing of the outer disk. We further speculate that
the observed surface brightness variability of the ansa(e) structures may
indicate that the inner disk wall is azimuthally asymmetric.

powerful mechanisms to discriminate among the competing theories of the early
universe. Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background
anisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of
modes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of
local type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased
tracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also
limited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,
and by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic
the same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of
these problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,
but not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased
tracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the
cosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the
structures comparable to the size of the survey. The square of error
improvement on non-gaussianity parameter f_nl relative to the power spectrum
method scales as Pn/2, where P and n is the power spectrum and the number
density of the biased tracer, respectively. For an ideal survey out to z=2 the
error reduction can be as large as a factor of seven, which should guarantee a
detection of non-gaussianity from an all sky survey of this type. The
improvements could be even larger if high density tracers that are sensitive to
non-gaussianity can be identified and measured over a large volume.

Western economies 1881-2001. They examine four distinct periods in economic
history, and conclude that there is a secular trend towards greater
synchronisation for much of the 20th century. Their analysis, in common with
the standard economic literature on business cycle synchronisation, relies upon
the estimation of an empirical correlation matrix of time series data of
macroeconomic aggregates. However because of the small number of observations
and economies, the empirical correlation matrix may contain considerable noise.
Random matrix theory was developed to overcome this problem. I use random
matrix theory, and the associated technique of agglomerative hierarchical
clustering, to examine the evolution of business cycle synchronisation between
the capitalist economies in the long-run. Contrary to the findings of Bordo and
Helbing, it is not possible to speak of a 'secular trend' towards greater
synchronisation over the period as a whole. During the pre-First World War
period, the cross-country correlations of annual real GDP growth are
indistinguishable from those which could be generated by a purely random
matrix. The periods 1920-38 and 1948-72 do show a certain degree of
synchronisation, but it is very weak. In particular, the cycles of the major
economies cannot be said to be synchronised. Such synchronisation as exists in
the overall data is due to meaningful co-movements in sub-groups. So the degree
of synchronisation has evolved fitfully. It is only in the most recent
1973-2006 period that we can speak meaningfully of anything resembling an
international business cycle.

(MANETs). This paper studies the role of multiple antennas in mitigating such
interference. Specifically, a network is studied in which receivers apply
zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers. Assuming a
network with Poisson distributed transmitters and independent Rayleigh fading
channels, the transmission capacity is derived, which gives the maximum number
of successful transmissions per unit area. Mathematical tools from stochastic
geometry are applied to obtain the asymptotic transmission capacity scaling and
characterize the impact of inaccurate channel state information (CSI). It is
shown that, if each node cancels L interferers, the transmission capacity
decreases as the outage probability to the power of 1/(L+1) as the outage
probability vanishes. For fixed outage probability, as L grows, the
transmission capacity increases as L to the power of (1-2/alpha) where alpha is
the path-loss exponent. Moreover, CSI inaccuracy is shown to have no effect on
the transmission capacity scaling as the outage probability vanishes, provided
that the CSI training sequence has an appropriate length, which we derived.
Numerical results suggest that canceling merely one interferer by each node
increases the transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more, even when
the CSI is imperfect.

GHz data were obtained using the Very Large Array (VLA) and High Sensitivity
Array (HSA) in November 2004, in full polarization, with a final r.m.s. noise
of 25 microJy/beam in the HSA total intensity image; the 86 GHz observations
were performed in October 2005 with the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA),
providing an angular resolution as good as 110 x 40 microarcseconds.
  Results: The sensitivity and resolution provided by the HSA make it possible
to detect the jet up to ~700 milliarcseconds (corresponding to a projected
linear size of ~500 pc) from its base, while the superior resolution of the 86
GHz GMVA observations probes the innermost regions of the jet down to ~200
Schwarzschild radii. The brightness temperature at the jet base is in excess of

warping also provides a solution for the energy budget in the emission line

central point-like source of ionizing radiation to capture the main

an order of magnitude higher than all theoretical predictions. Rayleigh
scattering off $H_2$ and $He$ may although give rise to a planet-star flux
ratio of the order of $10^{-4}$ in the blue band, it cannot account for the
high polarization unless the planet has an unusually extended atmosphere.
Therefore, it is suggested that the high polarization should be attributed to
the presence of a thin cloud of sub-micron size dust grains in the upper
visible atmosphere which supports the observational finding of an almost
feature-less transmission spectrum in the optical with no indication of the
expected alkaline absorption features. It is found that the polarimetry
observation allows for a small eccentricity of the orbit that is predicted from
the time delay of the secondary eclipse of the planet. The estimated longitude
of the ascending node is $16^o\pm6$ which interestingly coincides with the
observationally inferred location of the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness.

that the bulk viscosity contains the power (2\alpha-1) of the scalar expansion.

the search of the exact relativistic equations of motion for a classical

charged point-particle there should exist a relativistic equation of motion (RR
equation) which results both non-perturbative, in the sense that it does not
rely on a perturbative expansion on the electromagnetic field generated by the
charged particle and non-asymptotic, i.e., it does not depend on any

this well known problem, and in particular to point out that the RR equation is
necessarily variational. The approach is based on two key elements: 1) the
adoption of the relativistic hybrid synchronous Hamilton variational principle
recently pointed out (Tessarotto et al, 2006). Its basic feature is that it can
be expressed in principle in terms of arbitrary ""hybrid"" variables (i.e.,
generally non-Lagrangian and non-Hamiltonian variables); 2) the variational
treatment of the EM self-field, taking into account the exact particle
dynamics.

  $Y_c$ and $M_c$ stand for $\Lambda_c^+,\Sigma_c^+$ and
  $D,D^*$, respectively, at $\sqrt{s}\lesssim 15$ GeV, which corresponds to the
energy range of FAIR. Our consideration is based on the topological
decomposition of the planar quark and diquark diagrams which allows to estimate
consistently meson and baryon exchange trajectories and energy scale parameters
as well. The spin dependence is determined by the effective interaction of
lowest exchanged resonance. Unknown parameters are fixed by an independent
analysis of open strangeness production in $\bar pp\to \bar YY$ and $\bar pp\to
\bar KK$ reactions and of SU(4) symmetry. We present the corresponding cross
sections and longitudinal double-spin asymmetries for exclusive binary
reactions with open charm mesons and baryons in the final state. The
polarization observables have a non-trivial $t$ and $s$ dependence which is
sensitive to details of the open charm production mechanism.

and exogenous factors influencing them result in stochastic fluctuations of the
parameters determining their dynamics. These empirical systems are in many
cases subject to noise of multiplicative nature. The special properties of
multiplicative noise as opposed to additive noise have been noticed for a long
while. Even though apparently and formally the difference between free additive
vs. multiplicative random walks consists in just a move from normal to
log-normal distributions, in practice the implications are much more far
reaching. While in an additive context the emergence and survival of
cooperation requires special conditions (especially some level of reward,
punishment, reciprocity), we find that in the multiplicative random context the
emergence of cooperation is much more natural and effective. We study the
various implications of this observation and its applications in various
contexts.

corresponding reduced Compton's wave length of some boson systems in great
canonical ensemble. For macroscopic black hole ground state is practically
totally occupied while other states are practically totally unoccupied which is
a typical Bose condensation. Number of the systems in this condensate
represents black hole entropy. For microscopic black hole few lowest energy
levels are occupied with almost equivalent population (with negative chemical
potential) while all other energy states (with positive chemical potential) are
practically unoccupied. It implies that here not only spontaneous but also
stimulated emission of radiation comparable with spontaneous emission occurs.
By Hawking evaporation any macroscopic black hole turns out in a microscopic
black hole that yields, in a significant degree, coherent stimulated emission
of the radiation. It implies that by total black hole evaporation there is no
decoherence, i.e. information loss. Finally, a mass duality characteristic for

of the geometrical structures of astrophysical objects. Nevertheless, for
complex problems such as line overlap in molecules showing hyperfine structure,
a detailed analysis still requires a large amount of computing time and thus,
misinterpretation cannot be dismissed due to an undersampling of the whole
space of parameters. We extend the discussion of the implementation of the
Gauss--Seidel algorithm in spherical geometry and include the case of hyperfine
line overlap. We first review the basics of the short characteristics method
that is used to solve the radiative transfer equations. Details are given on
the determination of the Lambda operator in spherical geometry. The
Gauss--Seidel algorithm is then described and, by analogy to the plan--parallel
case, we see how to introduce it in spherical geometry. Doing so requires some
approximations in order to keep the algorithm competitive. Finally, line
overlap effects are included. The convergence speed of the algorithm is
compared to the usual Jacobi iterative schemes. The gain in the number of
iterations is typically factors of 2 and 4 for the two implementations made of
the Gauss--Seidel algorithm. This is obtained despite the introduction of
approximations in the algorithm. A comparison of results obtained with and
without line overlaps for N2H+, HCN, and HNC shows that the J=3-2 line
intensities are significantly underestimated in models where line overlap is
neglected.

conjectured in the algebraic Bethe-ansatz calculation of the XXZ correlation

correlation functions systematically for various solvable models associated
with the integrable XXZ spin chains.

structure of $^4$He drops doped with two magnesium atoms is also studied and
used to interpret the results of resonant two-photon-ionization (R2PI) and LIF

into a dimer, but rather form a weakly-bound state due to the presence of an
energy barrier caused by the helium environment that keep them some 9.5 \AA{}
apart, preventing the formation of the Mg$_2$ molecule. From this observation,
we suggest that Mg atoms in $^4$He drops may form, under suitable conditions, a
soft ``foam''-like aggregate rather than coalesce into a compact metallic
cluster. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with recent R2PI
experimental evidences. We predict that, contrarily, Mg atoms adsorbed in

coefficients determined by a prior FASTICA analysis. This multi-frequency
analysis allows us to determine the presence of residual foreground emission
not traced by the templates. We confirm the existence of a component spatially

  injector using high frequency PIV",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present work details the analysis of the aerodynamics of an experimental
swirl stabilized burner representative of gas turbine combustors. This analysis
is carried out using High Frequency PIV (HFPIV) measurements in a reactive
situation. While this information is usually available at a rather low rate,
temporally resolved PIV measurements are necessary to better understand highly
turbulent swirled flows, which are unsteady by nature. Thanks to recent
technical improvements, a PIV system working at 12 kHz has been developed to
study this experimental combustor flow field. Statistical quantities of the
burner are first obtained and analyzed, and the measurement quality is checked,
then a temporal analysis of the velocity field is carried out, indicating that
large coherent structures periodically appear in the combustion chamber. The
frequency of these structures is very close to the quarter wave mode of the
chamber, giving a possible explanation for combustion instability coupling.

a triangulated subcategory S of T which is both localizing and colocalizing,
for which neither a Bousfield localization nor a colocalization exists. It
follows that neither the category S nor its dual satisfy Brown
representability. Our example involves an abelian category whose derived
category does not have small Hom-sets.

limiting properties when the size N of the network grows. We focus mainly on
equilibrated networks and their finite-size degree distributions. Our results
show that subleading corrections to the scaling of the position of the cutoff
are strong even for networks of order 10^9 nodes. We observe also a logarithmic
correction to the scaling for degenerated graphs when the degree distribution
follows a power law k^(-3). We study also the distribution of the maximal
degree and show that it may have a different scaling than the cutoff and,
moreover, it approaches the thermodynamic limit much faster. We present also
some results on the cutoff function and the distribution of the maximal degree
in equilibrated networks.

random domains with unidirectional modulation of charge density and/or spin
density on Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} reinvigorates the debate of
existence of competing interactions and their importance in high temperature
superconductivity. By using a variational approach, here we show that the
presence of the cluster glass state is actually an inherent nature of the model
based on the antiferromagnetic interaction (J) only, i.e. the well known t-J
model. There is no need yet to introduce a competing interaction to understand
the existence of the cluster glass state. The long-range pairing correlation is
not much influenced by the disorder in the glass state which also has nodes and
linear density of states. In the antinodal region, the spectral weight is
almost completely suppressed. The modulation also produces subgap structures
inside the ""coherent"" peaks of the local density of states.
