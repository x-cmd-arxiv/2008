axions and map out two allowed windows: the classic window and the inflationary
anthropic window. The cosmology of the latter is particularly interesting;
inflationary axion cosmology predicts the existence of isocurvature
fluctuations in the CMB, with an amplitude that grows with both the energy
scale of inflation and the fraction of dark matter in axions. Statistical
arguments favor a substantial value for the latter, and so current bounds on
isocurvature fluctuations imply tight constraints on inflation. For example, an
axion Peccei-Quinn scale of 10^16 GeV excludes any inflation model with energy
scale > 3.8*10^14 GeV (r > 2*10^(-9)) at 95% confidence, and so implies
negligible gravitational waves from inflation, but suggests appreciable
isocurvature fluctuations.

energy (TKE) and modelled using solely the TKE budget equation. In stable
stratification, TKE is generated by the velocity shear and expended through
viscous dissipation and work against buoyancy forces. The effect of
stratification is characterized by the ratio of the buoyancy gradient to
squared shear, called Richardson number, Ri. It is widely believed that at Ri
exceeding a critical value, Ric, local shear cannot maintain turbulence, and
the flow becomes laminar. We revise this concept by extending the energy
analysis to turbulent potential and total energies (TPE and TTE = TKE + TPE),
consider their budget equations, and conclude that TTE is a conservative
parameter maintained by shear in any stratification. Hence there is no
""energetics Ric"", in contrast to the hydrodynamic-instability threshold,
Ric-instability, whose typical values vary from 0.25 to 1. We demonstrate that
this interval, 0.25<Ri<1, separates two different turbulent regimes: strong
mixing and weak mixing rather than the turbulent and the laminar regimes, as
the classical concept states. This explains persistent occurrence of turbulence
in the free atmosphere and deep ocean at Ri>>1, clarify principal difference
between turbulent boundary layers and free flows, and provide basis for
improving operational turbulence closure models.

also open to manipulation. Metrics are needed to measure the networking
intensity for a single scientist or group of scientists accounting for patterns
of co-authorship. Here, I define I1 for a single scientist as the number of
authors who appear in at least I1 papers of the specific scientist. For a group
of scientists or institution, In is defined as the number of authors who appear
in at least In papers that bear the affiliation of the group or institution. I1
depends on the number of papers authored Np. The power exponent R of the
relationship between I1 and Np categorizes scientists as solitary (R>2.5),
nuclear (R=2.25-2.5), networked (R=2-2.25), extensively networked (R=1.75-2) or

the citation impact of a scientist. In similarly provides a simple measure of

system has its own internally consistent explanation for how energy balance is

magnetic field. We find that both the magnetic oscillations, SdH and Weiss,
have a greater amplitude and are more robust against temperature in graphene

which bear a high degree of similarity. Previous work has shown how these
distributions can be accounted for by simple models, where the main ingredients
are probabilities of duplication, innovation, and loss of domains. However, no
one so far has addressed the issue that these distributions follow definite
trends depending on protein-coding genome size only. We present a stochastic
duplication/innovation model, falling in the class of so-called Chinese
Restaurant Processes, able to explain this feature of the data. Using only two
universal parameters, related to a minimal number of domains and to the
relative weight of innovation to duplication, the model reproduces two
important aspects: (a) the populations of domain classes (the sets, related to
homology classes, containing realizations of the same domain in different
proteins) follow common power-laws whose cutoff is dictated by genome size, and
(b) the number of domain families is universal and markedly sublinear in genome
size. An important ingredient of the model is that the innovation probability
decreases with genome size. We propose the possibility to interpret this as a
global constraint given by the cost of expanding an increasingly complex
interactome.

One example of the similarities between these two types of systems is the

spectrum of this variability in black hole binaries consists of a broad,
band-limited noise with multiple quasi-periodic oscillations superimposed,
where power is concentrated over a narrow range of frequencies. Although the

are no significant detections of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here we report
the discovery of a ~1h X-ray periodicity in a bright active galaxy RE

speed using the radial Tremaine-Weinberg (TWR) method. We implement the method
on CO observations tracing the ISM-dominant molecular component. Results from
the method's numerical implementation--combined with regularization, which
smooths intrinsically noisy solutions--indicate two distinct patterns speeds
inside 4 kpc at our derived major axis PA=170 deg., both ending at corotation
and both significantly higher than the conventionally adopted global value.
Inspection of the rotation curve suggests that the pattern speed interior to 2
kpc lacks an ILR, consistent with the leading structure seen in HST near-IR
observations. We also find tentative evidence for a lower pattern speed between
4 and 5.3 kpc measured by extending the regularized zone. As with the original
TW method, uncertainty in major axis position angle (PA) is the largest source
of error in the calculation; in this study, where \delta PA=+/-5 deg. a ~20%
error is introduced to the parameters of the speeds at PA=170 deg. Accessory to
this standard uncertainty, solutions with PA=175 deg. (also admitted by the

of stellar evolutionary tracks accounting for rotation has recently been

synthesis code. Massive stars are predicted to be hotter and more luminous than
previously thought, and the spectral energy distributions of young populations
mirror this trend. The hydrogen ionizing continuum in particular increases by a
factor of up to 3 in the presence of rotating massive stars. The effects of
rotation generally increase towards shorter wavelengths and with decreasing
metallicity. Revised relations between star-formation rates and monochromatic

suggest that, like jets, these flows become unstable some distance down-stream,

  The background for the question is the following. The classical H.Hopf's
hypothesis states: for any Riemannian metric on $S^2 \times S^2$ of nonnegative
sectional curvature the curvature cannot be strictly positive at all points.
There is no quick answer to this question: it is known that a Riemannian metric
on $S^2 \times S^2$ of nonnegative sectional curvature need not be a product
metric. However, M.Gromov has pointed out that the condition of nonnegative
curvature in the PL-case appears to be stronger than nonnegative sectional
curvature of Riemannian manifolds and analogous to some condition on the
curvature operator. So the motivation for the question addressed in this text
is to settle the PL-version of the Hopf's hypothesis.

shear formulae generalize to all multipoles and to flexions. We re-derive the
result of Schneider and Bartelmann that the shear multipole m at radius R is
completely determined by the mass multipole at R, plus specific moments Q^m_in
and Q^m_out of the mass multipoles internal and external, respectively, to R.
The m>=0 multipoles are independent of Q_out. But in contrast to the monopole,
the m<0 multipoles are independent of Q_in. These internal and external mass
moments can be determined by shear (and/or flexion) data on the complementary
portion of the plane, which has practical implications for lens modelling. We
find that the ease of E/B separation in the monopole aperture moments does {\em
not} generalize to m!=0: the internal monopole moment is the {\em only}
non-local E/B discriminant available from lensing observations. We have also
not found practical local E/B discriminants beyond the monopole, though they
could exist. We show also that the use of weak-lensing data to constrain a

of a particle of energy u by a Schwarzschild black hole (ScBH) is approximately
(u/T)-s, where T is the Hawking temperature of the black hole and s is the
entropy of the particle. Motivated by the statistical interpretation of
entropy, it is proposed here that absorption should be suppressed, but not
forbidden, when /DeltaS<0, which requires the absorption cross-section to be
sensitive to /DeltaS. A purely thermodynamic formulation of the probability for
absorption is obtained from the standard relationship between microstates and
entropy. If /DeltaS>>1 and s<<u/T then the probability for the particle not to
be absorbed is approximately exp[-u/T], which is identical to the probability
for quantum mechanical reflection by the horizon of a ScBH. The manifestation
of quantum behaviors in the new probability function may intimate a fundamental
physical unity between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

Quantum Black Holes and Noncommutative Geometry. We start with a review of
models proposed in the literature for describing deformations of General
Relativity in the presence of noncommutativity, seen as an effective theory of
Quantum Gravity. We study the resulting metrics, proposed to replace or at
least to improve the conventional black hole solutions of Einstein's equation.
In particular, we analyze noncommutative-inspired solutions obtained in terms
of quasi-classical noncommutative coordinates: indeed because of their
surprising new features, these solutions enable us to circumvent long standing
problems with Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space and to cure the singular
behavior of gravity at the centers of black holes. As a consequence, for the
first time, we get a complete description of what we may call the black hole
SCRAM, the shut down of the emission of thermal radiation from the black hole:
in place of the conventional scenario of runaway evaporation in the Planck
phase, we find a zero temperature final state, a stable black hole remnant,
whose size and mass are determined uniquely in terms of the noncommutative
parameter $\theta$. This result turns out to be of vital importance for the
physics of the forthcoming experiments at the LHC, where mini black hole
production is foreseen in extreme energy hadron collisions. Because of this, we
devote the final part of this review to higher dimensional solutions and their
phenomenological implications for TeV Gravity.

constituent degrees of freedom in this dense matter are currently unknown.
Long-range, forward-backward multiplicity correlations (LRC) are expected to
arise due to multiple partonic interactions. Model independent and dependent
arguments suggest that such correlations are due to multiple partonic
interactions. These correlations are predicted in the context of the Dual
Parton Model (DPM). The DPM describes soft partonic processes and
hadronization. This model indicates that the underlying mechanism creating
these long-range multiplicity correlations in the bulk matter is due to
multiple partonic interactions.
  In this thesis, long-range multiplicity correlations have been studied in
heavy ion (Au+Au and Cu+Cu) and hadron-hadron ({\it pp}) collisions. The
behavior has been studied as a function of pseudorapidity gap ($\Delta\eta$)
about $\eta$ = 0, the centrality, atomic number, and incident energy dependence
of the colliding particles. Strong, long-range correlations ($\Delta\eta >$
1.0) as a function of $\Delta\eta$ are found for central collisions of %(full

substantial amounts of dense partonic matter are formed in central heavy ion

has been well documented in both biofilm and planktonic settings. However,
there is still very little known about the mechanisms that produce this
tolerance. Evidence that small, non-mutant subpopulations of bacteria are not
affected by antibiotic challenge has been accumulating and provides an
attractive explanation for the failure of typical dosing protocols. Although a
dosing challenge can kill all the susceptible bacteria, the remaining persister
cells can serve as a source of population regrowth. We give a robust condition
for the failure of a periodic dosing protocol for a general chemostat model,
which supports the mathematical conclusions and simulations of an earlier, more
specialized batch model. Our condition implies that the treatment protocol
fails globally, in the sense that a mixed bacterial population will ultimately
persist above a level that is independent of the initial composition of the
population. We also give a sufficient condition for treatment success, at least
for initial population compositions near the steady state of interest,
corresponding to bacterial washout. Finally, we investigate how the speed at
which the bacteria are wiped out depends on the duration of administration of
the antibiotic. We find that this dependence is not necessarily monotone,
implying that optimal dosing does not necessarily correspond to continuous
administration of the antibiotic. Thus, genuine periodic protocols can be more
advantageous in treating a wide variety of bacterial infections.

space motions of the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC,
respectively) have strongly suggested that the latest proper motion
measurements of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are consistent with their orbital
evolution models in which the MCs have arrived in the Galaxy quite recently for
the first time. The suggested orbital models appear to be seriously
inconsistent with the tidal interaction models in which the Magellanic Stream
(MS) can be formed as a result of the mutual tidal interaction between the MCs
and the Galaxy for the last ~2 Gyr. Based on orbital models of the MCs, we
propose that if the MCs have a common diffuse dark halo with the mass larger
than ~ 2 * 10^{10} M_sun, the MCs can not only have the present 3D velocities
consistent with the latest proper motion measurements but also interact
strongly with each other and with the Galaxy for the last 2 Gyr.These results
imply that if the observed proper motions of the MCs are true ones of the
centers of mass for the MCs, the common halo of the MCs would need to be
considered in constructing self-consistent MS formation models. We discuss
whether the origin of the possible common halo can be closely associated either
with the past binary formation or with the MCs having been in a small group.

the isomorphism that is birational and symplectic between some open, in a
Zariski topology, domain of the reduced space and the Cartesian product of the
orbits in question. The method is based on a Gauss decomposition of a matrix on
a product of upper-triangular, lower-triangular and diagonal matrices. It works
uniformly for the orbits formed by diagonalizable or not-diagonalizable
matrices. It is elaborated for the orbits of maximal dimension that is
$m(m-1)$.

flow with toroidal magnetic field is investigated. The study especially focused
the astrophysically important case in which the adiabatic exponent
$\gamma=5/3$. In this scenario, it was assumed that the angular momentum
transport is due to viscous turbulence and used $\alpha$-prescription for
kinematic coefficient of viscosity. The equations of accretion flow are solved
in a simplified one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence
of the flow. In order to solve the integrated equations which govern the
dynamical behavior of the accretion flow, self-similar solution was used. The
solution provides some insight into the dynamics of quasi-spherical accretion
flow and avoids many of the strictures of the steady self-similar solution. The
effect of the toroidal magnetic field is considered with additional variable
$\beta[=p_{mag}/p_{gas}]$, where $p_{mag}$ and $p_{gas}$ are the magnetic and
gas pressure, respectively. The solution indicates a transonic point in the
accretion flow, that this point approaches to central object by adding strength
of the magnetic field. Also, by adding strength of the magnetic field, the
radial-thickness of the disk decreases and the disk compresses. It was
analytically indicated that the radial velocity is only a function of Alfv'en
velocity. The model implies that the flow has differential rotation and is
sub-Keplerian at all radii.

communities. The model corresponds to the phenomenon of defeats suffered by
social groups living in isolation. A nonequilibrium phase transition is
observed when at critical time $t_c$ the first isolated cluster occurs. In the
one-dimensional system the volume of the new phase, i.e. the number of the
isolated individuals, increases with time as $Z \sim t^3$. For a large number
of possible communities the critical density of filled space equals to $\rho_c
= (m/N)^{1/3}$ where $N$ is the system size. A similar transition is observed
for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs and Barab\'{a}si-Albert scale-free
networks. Analytic results are in agreement with numerical simulations.
