spatially localized signaling complex are often essential for the maintenance
of an appropriate biological response. Although scaffolds are widely believed
to have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms
that underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo
simulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal
characteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of
scaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing
kinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate
that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is
to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time.
Scaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases
to become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at
both early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal
signal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which
kinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism
that describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a
scaffold mediated protein kinase cascade. Our results illustrate another
complexity in the broad array of control properties that emerge from the
physical effects of spatially localizing components of kinase cascades on
scaffold proteins.

family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal
structure with transition metal ions in planar square lattice form and the
discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K seem to hint at a strong
similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. A burning current issue is
the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of
theories have been put forward depending on the underlying band structures:
local moment antiferromagnetic ground state for strong coupling approach and
itinerant ground state for weak coupling approach. The local moment magnetism
approach stresses on-site correlations and proximity to a Mott insulating state
and thus the resemblance to cuprates; while the latter approach emphasizes the
itinerant electron physics and the interplay between the competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Such a controversy is partly
due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic
structures. Here we report the first angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) investigation of LaOFeP (Tc = 5.9 K), the first reported iron-based
superconductor. Our results favor the itinerant ground state, albeit with band
renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between
these and copper based superconductors.

congestion games. Altruistic behavior is modeled by a trade-off between selfish
and social objectives. In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear
combination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in
social cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games
with player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria
of these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of
sequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric
singleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For
concave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria
and provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric
singleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended
to compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general
congestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric
network games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all
delay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any
congestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In
addition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in
which a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act
altruistically. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the
minimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more
general mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior.

Data Release 5 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to have extraordinary
large broad Halpha luminosities, ranging from 3x10^41 to 2x10^42 erg/s. The
oxygen abundance in these galaxies is very low, varying in the range 12+logO/H
= 7.36- 7.99. Such extraordinarily high broad Halpha luminosities cannot be
accounted for by massive stars at different stages of their evolution. By
comparing with the first-epoch SDSS spectra, we find that the broad Halpha
luminosities have remained constant over a period of 3-7 years, which probably
excludes type IIn supernovae as a possible mechanism of broad emission. The
emission most likely comes from accretion disks around intermediate-mass black
holes with lower mass limits in the range ~5x10^5 Msun-3x10^6 Msun. If so,
these four objects form a new class of very low-metallicity AGN that have been
elusive until now. The absence of the strong high-ionization lines [NeV] 3426
and He II 4686 can be understood if the nonthermal radiation contributes less
than ~10% of the total ionizing radiation.

agents interacting as they infer, under the presence of observation errors,
respective models of a complex system. We focus the specific case in which, at
each time step, each agent takes into account its current observation as well
as the average of the models of its neighbors. The agents are connected by a
network of interaction of Erd\H{o}s-Renyi or Barabasi-Albert type. First we
investigate situations in which one of the agents has a different probability
of observation error (higher or lower). It is shown that the influence of this
special agent over the quality of the models inferred by the rest of the
network can be substantial, varying linearly with the respective degree of the
agent with different estimation error. In case the degree of this agent is
taken as a respective fitness parameter, the effect of the different estimation
error is even more pronounced, becoming superlinear. To complement our
analysis, we provide the analytical solution of the overall behavior of the
system. We also investigate the knowledge acquisition dynamic when the agents
are grouped into communities. We verify that the inclusion of edges between
agents (within a community) having higher probability of observation error
promotes the loss of quality in the estimation of the agents in the other
communities.

geometry is a physical geometry, i.e. it is described completely by the world

geometry cannot be axiomatized, in general. It is obtained as a result of
deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry. Class of physical geometries is
more powerful, than the class of axiomatized geometries. The physical geometry
admits one to describe such geometric properties as discreteness, granularity
and limited divisibility. These properties are important in application to the
space-time. They admits one to explain the discrimination properties of the
space-time, which generate discrete parameters of elementary particles.
Mathematical formalism of a physical geometry is very simple. The physical
geometry is formulated in geometrical terms (in terms of points and world
function) without a use of means of description (coordinate system, space
dimension, manifold, etc.).

defect formation is particularly useful in the understanding of the same
mathematical structure of quantum field theory with particular reference to the
processes of non-equilibrium symmetry breaking. The functional realization of
fractals in terms of the q-deformed algebra of coherent states is also
presented. From one side, this sheds some light on the dynamical formation of
fractals. From the other side, it also exhibits the fractal nature of coherent
states, thus opening new perspectives in the analysis of those phenomena where
coherent states play a relevant role. The global nature of fractals appears to
emerge from local deformation processes and fractal properties are incorporated
in the framework of the theory of entire analytical functions.
