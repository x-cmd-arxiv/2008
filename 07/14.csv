geometrically frustrated pyrochlore Tb2Mo2O7 using single crystal samples. This
material undergoes a spin-freezing transition below Tg~24 K, similar to
Y2Mo2O7, and has little apparent chemical disorder. Diffuse elastic peaks are
observed at low temperatures, indicating short-range ordering of the Tb moments
in an arrangement where the Tb moments are slightly rotated from the preferred
directions of the spin ice structure. In addition, a Q-independent signal is
observed which likely originates from frozen, but completely uncorrelated, Tb
moments. Inelastic measurements show the absence of sharp peaks due to crystal
field excitations. These data show how the physics of the Tb sublattice
responds to the glassy behavior of the Mo sublattice with the associated
effects of lattice disorder.

independence between the edges. The aim of this paper is to present an
extension of this model in which the edges are far from independent, and to
prove several results about this extension. The basic idea is to construct the
random graph by adding not only edges but also other small graphs. In other
words, we first construct an inhomogeneous random hypergraph with independent
hyperedges, and then replace each hyperedge by a (perhaps complete) graph.
Although flexible enough to produce graphs with significant dependence between
edges, this model is nonetheless mathematically tractable. Indeed, we find the
critical point where a giant component emerges in full generality, in terms of
the norm of a certain integral operator, and relate the size of the giant
component to the survival probability of a certain (non-Poisson) multi-type
branching process. While our main focus is the phase transition, we also study
the degree distribution and the numbers of small subgraphs. We illustrate the
model with a simple special case that produces graphs with power-law degree
sequences with a wide range of degree exponents and clustering coefficients.

theory of relativity. Furthermore, the causal arrow of time by definition
contradicts time-reversal symmetry. For these reasons, some authors (Feynman

microscopic causality. In the present article, a simplistic but concrete
example of following this line of thought is presented, in the form of a
retro-causal toy-model which is stochastic and which provides an appealing

at the input mirrors and using the etalon effect instead in the end mirrors. We

that the mean displacement of a particle initially localized on one of the

therefore quantized as an integer, changing from zero to one at the critical
point. This problem can serve as a simplified model for nuclear spin pumping in
the spin-blockaded electron transport regime of quantum dots in the presence of
competing hyperfine and spin-orbital interactions. The predicted transition
from pumping to non-pumping is topological in nature, and is hence robust

stars, we combine our results with data for other young clusters. The frequency
of debris disks around A-type stars appears to increase from ~ 25% at 5 Myr to
~ 50--60% at 20--25 Myr. Older A-type stars have smaller debris disk
frequencies: ~ 20% at 50--100 Myr. For these ages, the typical level of debris
emission rises from 5--20 Myr and then declines. Because 24 micron dust
emission probes icy planet formation around A-type stars, our results suggest
that the frequency of icy planet formation is eta(i) > 0.5--0.6. Thus, most
A-type stars (approx. 1.5--3 Msun) produce icy planets.

that the majority of quasars show Fe II emission that is redshifted, typically

narrow-line region or of the conventional broad-line region as traced by the
Hbeta line. Moreover, the line width of Fe II is significantly narrower than
that of the broad component of Hbeta. We show that the magnitude of the Fe II
redshift correlates inversely with the Eddington ratio, and that there is a
tendency for sources with redshifted Fe II emission to show red asymmetry in
the Hbeta line. These characteristics strongly suggest that Fe II originates
from a location different from, and most likely exterior to, the region that
produces most of Hbeta. The Fe II-emitting zone traces a portion of the

a key point is the fact that the cycle space $\mathcal M_D$ of a flag domain
$D$ is a Stein manifold. That fact has a long history. The earliest approach
relied on construction of a strictly plurisubharmonic function on $\mathcal
M_D$, starting with a $q$--convex exhaustion function on $D$, where $q$ is the
dimension of a particular maximal compact subvariety of $D$ (we use the
normalization that 0--convex means Stein). Construction of that exhaustion
function on $D$ required that $D$ be measurable. In that case the exhaustion on
$D$ was transferred to $\mathcal M_D$, using a special case of a method due to
Barlet. Here we do the opposite: we use an incidence method to construct a
canonical plurisubharmonic exhaustion function on $\mathcal M_D$ and use it in
turn to construct a canonical $q$--convex exhaustion function on $D$. This
promises to have strong consequences for cohomology vanishing theorems and the
construction of admissible representations of real reductive Lie groups.

solve relevant Yang-Baxter equation for a spin chain system associated with the

Hamiltonian involving three-site interactions between 4 and 4*. At weak `t

dilatation operator to single trace operators up to two loops. To ensure
consistency, we computed all relevant Feynman diagrams contributing to the
dilatation opeator. We find that resulting spin chain Hamiltonian matches with
the Hamiltonian derived from Yang-Baxter equation. We further study new issues
arising from the shortest gauge invariant operators transforming as 15 and 1

presence of a magnetic field.
  The study of the radial velocities using CORALIE spectra allowed us to
significantly improve the orbital parameters. A comparative NLTE abundance
analysis was undertaken for theta Car and two other early B-type stars with
recently detected magnetic fields, tau Sco and xi^1 CMa. The analysis revealed
significantly different abundance patterns: a one-order-of-magnitude nitrogen
overabundance and carbon depletion was found in theta Car, while the oxygen
abundance is roughly solar. For the stars xi^1 CMa and tau Sco the carbon
abundance is solar and, while an N excess is also detected, it is of much
smaller amplitude (0.4-0.6dex). Such an N overabundance is typical of the
values already found for other slowly-rotating (magnetic) B-type dwarfs. For
theta Car, we attribute instead the chemical peculiarities to a past episode of
mass transfer between the two binary components. The results of the search for
a magnetic field using FORS1 at the VLT consisting of 26 measurements over a
time span of ~1.2h are rather inconclusive: only few measurements have a
significance level of 3sigma. Although we detect a periodicity of the order of
~8.8min in the dataset involving the measurements on all hydrogen Balmer lines

regions provide important information for aseismatic engineering and
theoretical seismology. They are almost founded on an oversimplified
assumption: any 3-dimensional (3D) actual object with special symmetry could be
regarded as a 2D finite object in light of the corresponding symmetry. To gain
an actual evolution of precariously balanced objects subjected to various
levels of ground accelerations, a 3D investigation should be performed. In
virtue of some reasonable works from a number of mechanicians, we derive three
resultant second-order ordinary differential equations determine the evolution
of 3D responses. The new dynamic analysis is following the 3D rotation of a
rigid body around a fixed point. A computer program for numerical solution of
these equations is also developed to simulate the rocking and rolling response
of axisymmetric objects to various levels of ground accelerations. It is shown
that the 2D and 3D estimates on the minimum overturning acceleration of a
cylinder under the same sets of half- and full-sine-wave pulses are almost
consistent except at several frequency bonds. However, we find that the 2D and
3D responses using the actual seismic excitation have distinct differences,
especially to north-south (NS) and up-down (UD) components. In this work the
chosen seismic wave is the El Centro recording of the 18 May 1940 Imperial
Valley Earthquake. The 3D outcome does not seem to support the 2D previous
result that the vertical component of the ground acceleration is less important
than the horizontal ones. We conclude that the 2D dynamic modeling is not
always reliable.

of the SMC. We adopt both the Burkert and the NFW profiles for the dark matter
halo of the SMC in order to model the radial profile of the observed rotation
curve. We show that the mass ($M_{\rm dm}$) and the mean density (${\rho}_{\rm
dm}$) of the dark matter halo within the optical radius ($\sim 3$ kpc) of the
SMC can be significantly low for $M_{\rm s}/L_{\rm V}=2-4$ reasonable for a
galaxy dominated by older stellar populations. For example, the estimated
$M_{\rm dm}$ and ${\rho}_{\rm dm}$ are $7.5 \times 10^7 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and
$6.7 \times 10^{-4} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$, respectively, for $M_{\rm
s}/L_{\rm V} = 3.8$. The models with lower $M_{\rm s}/L_{\rm V}$ ($<1.0$) can
show higher $M_{\rm dm}$ and ${\rho}_{\rm dm}$ yet have difficulties in
reproducing the inner rotation curve profile both for the Burkert and the NFW
profiles. The Burkert profile with a larger core radius ($>1$ kpc) (thus a low
density) and a large mass (${\rm M}_{\rm dm} > 3 \times 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$)
can be better fit to the observed slowly rising rotation curve than the NFW one
for a reasonable $M_{\rm s}/L_{\rm V} \sim2$. This means that most of the dark
halo mass can be initially located outside the optical radius in the SMC and
thus that the dark halo would have already lost a significant fraction of its
original mass due to the strong tidal interactions with the Galaxy and possibly
with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

We find that the advance speed of hot spots and lobes inevitably show the
deceleration phase (CSO-MSO phase) and the acceleration phase (MSO-FRII phase).
This is ascribed to the change of the power-law index of ambient density
profile in the MSO phase ($\sim $1 kpc). It is also found that the cocoon shape
becomes nearly spherical or disrupted for MSOs, while an elongated morphology
is predicted for CSOs and FRIIs. This seems to be consistent with the higher
fraction of distorted morphology of MSOs than that of CSOs and FRI.

cooperating strategies dominate the whole population via proliferation of

simplified replicator dynamics and observe a similar evolutionary pattern to
reach the cooperating equilibrium. In particular, the rise of a modified
tit-for-tat strategy plays a central role, which implies how a robust strategy

does not partake in the spin down of the star.
  We find that we can explain the observed properties, such as the period and
field distributions and the Period - Period derivative diagram, if we suitably
parametrise the time evolution of the anomalous X-ray luminosity as an
exponentially decaying function of time.
  The magnetic flux of the neutron stars is required to be a strong function of
the progenitor mass with the magnetars arising from the mass range 20-45 solar

  Unlike with the radio pulsars, the magnetars only weakly constrain the birth
spin period, due to their rapid spin-down. Our model predicts a birthrate of

of identical master and slave generalized Lorenz systems coupled by linear

linearization and Lyapunov's direct methods. When a simple linear controller is
used in the scheme, some easily implemented algebraic synchronization

sharpness. The optimized criteria are then applied to four typical generalized
Lorenz systems, i.e. the classical Lorenz system, the Chen system, the Lv

synchronization conditions. The advantages of the new criteria are revealed by
analytically and numerically comparing their sharpness with that of the known

differential equations. In this work, we consider the trapezoidal family of
schemes for integrating the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each
subdomain and present four different coupling methods, corresponding to
different algebraic constraints, for enforcing kinematic continuity on the
interface between the subdomains.
  Method 1 (d-continuity) is based on the conventional approach using
continuity of the primary variable and we show that this method is unstable for
a lot of commonly used time integrators including the mid-point rule. To
alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new Method 2 (Modified d-continuity)
and prove its stability for coupling all time integrators in the trapezoidal
family (except the forward Euler). Method 3 (v-continuity) is based on
enforcing the continuity of the time derivative of the primary variable.
However, this constraint introduces a drift in the primary variable on the
interface. We present Method 4 (Baumgarte stabilized) which uses Baumgarte
stabilization to limit this drift and we derive bounds for the stabilization
parameter to ensure stability.
  Our stability analysis is based on the ``energy'' method, and one of the main
contributions of this paper is the extension of the energy method (which was
previously introduced in the context of numerical methods for ODEs) to assess
the stability of numerical formulations for index-2 differential-algebraic
equations (DAEs).

a one form back to the 1974 Vancouver ICM address of I.M. Singer. Our main
theorem gives analytic formulae for the spectral flow along a norm
differentiable path of self-adjoint bounded Breuer-Fredholm operators in a
semi-finite von Neumann algebra. These formulae have a geometric interpretation
which derives from the proof. Namely we define a family of Banach submanifolds
of all bounded self-adjoint Breuer-Fredholm operators and on each submanifold
define global one forms whose integral on a norm differentiable path contained
in the submanifold calculates the spectral flow along this path. We emphasise
that our methods do not give a single globally defined one form on the self
adjoint Breuer- Fredholms whose integral along all paths is spectral flow
rather, as the choice of the plural `forms' in the title suggests, we need a
family of such one forms in order to confirm Singer's idea. The original
context for this result concerned paths of unbounded self-adjoint Fredholm
operators. We therefore prove analogous formulae for spectral flow in the
unbounded case as well. The proof is a synthesis of key contributions by
previous authors, whom we acknowledge in detail in the introduction, combined
with an additional important recent advance in the differential calculus of
functions of non-commuting operators.

amount of complex structure in the host galaxy, which is $\sim$ 8 kpc in extent
and contains several bright compact substructures, with the quasar source
residing in one of these bright substructures. Additionally, we recover the
mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, assuming a simply-parameterised model,
using information from both the quasar images and the extended images. This
allows a direct comparison of the amount of information about the lens that is
provided by the quasar images in comparison to the extended images. In this

established for a generic Quantum Field Theory with vanishing vacuum
expectation values of the fundamental fields. The Effective Actions in both
formalisms are the same if and only if the fundamental fields and the momentum
fields are related by the stationarity condition. These momentum fields in
general differ from the canonical fields as defined via the Effective Action.
By means of functional methods a systematic procedure is presented to identify
the full correlation functions, which depend on the momentum fields, as
functionals of those usually appearing in the standard Lagrange formalism.
Whereas Lagrange correlation functions can be decomposed into tree diagrams the
decomposition of Hamilton correlation functions involves loop corrections
similar to those arising in n-particle effective actions. To demonstrate the
method we derive for theories with linearized interactions the propagators of
composite auxiliary fields and the ones of the fundamental degrees of freedom.
The formalism is then utilized in the case of Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory
for which the relations between the two-point correlation functions of the
transversal and longitudinal components of the conjugate momentum to the ones
of the gauge field are given.

activity and, in particular, harbors a resolved X-ray jet. We demonstrate that
its soft and hard X-ray components are separated spatially by approximately 0.2
arcsec by deriving the spatial offset between both components from the event
centroids of the soft and hard photons utilizing the intrinsic
energy-resolution of the Chandra ACIS-S detector. We also demonstrate that this
offset is physical and cannot be attributed to an instrumental origin or to low
counting statistics. Furthermore, the location of the derived soft X-ray
emission peak coincides with emission peaks observed for optical emission
lines, suggesting that both, soft X-rays and optical emission, have the same

data. Assuming instantaneous reheating, we find that modular/new inflation
models with small powers in the effective inflaton self-interaction are more
strongly constrained than previously. The model with a cubic power lies outside
the 2 sigma regime when the number of e-folds is less than 60. We also find
that the predictions for the intermediate model of inflation do not overlap the
1 sigma region regardless of the power of the monomial potential. We analyse a
number of ultra-violet, DBI braneworld scenarios involving both wrapped and
multiple-brane configurations, where the inflaton kinetic energy is close to
the maximum allowed by the warped geometry. In all cases, we find that the
parameters of the warped throat are strongly constrained by observations.

  appendix describes how the existence issue for classical PDE maps into a
  formulation of the existence issue for bosonic quantum field theory",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  At present, there exists no physically plausible example of a quantum field
theory for which the existence of solutions has been proven mathematically. The
Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a prize for proving existence for a
class of Yang-Mills theories defined by Jaffe and Witten. This paper proposes a
multi-stage strategy for proving existence for a quantum version of the
""'tHooft Polyakov"" (tP) field theory, and argues that this theory, while not
renormalizable or physically plausible as it stands, opens up a clear path to a
physically plausible well-defined theory. The key initial challenge is to first
prove stability for a classical version of this theory, in the spirit of Walter
Strauss. The stability results of Bogomolnyi for classical PDE systems are
widely cited as a foundation of string theory, but they leave key questions
unaddressed, and may even call for small modifications of the tP model itself.
This paper calls attention to the questions which require more attention, and
proposes some partial possible answers. It also specifies a new numerical
method to check for stability for the usual ""hedgehog"" types of solution, a
method which may have broader potential uses for any ODE problems where
accuracy in derivatives is as important as accuracy in function values.

inertia (NCRI) in a torsional oscillator by constraining it to narrow annular
cells of various widths. The NCRI exhibits a broad maximum value of 20% for
annuli of approximately 100 micrometer width. Samples constrained to porous
media or to larger geometries both have smaller NCRI, mostly below about 1%. In
addition, we extend Kim and Chan's blocked annulus experiment to solid samples
with large supersolid fractions. Blocking the annulus suppresses the
nonclassical decoupling from 17.1% below the limit of our detection of 0.8%.
This result demonstrates the nonlocal nature of the supersolid phenomena. At 20
mK, NCRI depends on velocity history showing a closed hysteresis loop in
different thin annular cells.

Combining the correction with Schmidt games, we generalize the theorem in

closures miss x is a winning set.

the Isgur-Karl model. The results obtained are consistent with a sizable Sivers
effect and the signs for the u and d flavor contributions turn out to be
opposite. The Burkardt Sum Rule is fulfilled to a large extent. After the
estimate of the QCD evolution of the results from the momentum scale of the

is obtained. A calculation of nuclear effects in the extraction of neutron
