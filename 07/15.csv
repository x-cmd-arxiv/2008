stars in eight of the least luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the
Milky Way (MW) system. Our technique is based on medium resolution Keck/DEIMOS
spectroscopy coupled with spectral synthesis. We present the first
spectroscopic metallicities at [Fe/H] < -3.0 of stars in a dwarf galaxy, with
individual stellar metallicities as low as [Fe/H] = -3.3. Because our [Fe/H]
measurements are not tied to empirical metallicity calibrators and are
sensitive to arbitrarily low metallicities, we are able to probe this extremely
metal-poor regime accurately. The metallicity distribution of stars in these
dSphs is similar to the MW halo at the metal-poor end. We also demonstrate that
the luminosity-metallicity relation previously seen in more luminous dSph
galaxies (M_V = -13.4 to -8.8) extends smoothly down to an absolute magnitude
of M_V = -3.7. The discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in dSphs lends
support to the LCDM galaxy assembly paradigm wherein dwarf galaxies dissolve to
form the stellar halo of the MW.

shape function) plays an important role in the analysis of the B -> X_s gamma

determination of |Vub|. We introduce a new framework to treat the shape
function, which consistently incorporates its renormalization group evolution
and all constraints on its shape and moments in any short distance mass scheme.
At the same time it allows a reliable treatment of the uncertainties. We
develop an expansion in a suitable complete set of orthonormal basis functions,
which provides a procedure for systematically controlling the uncertainties due
to the unknown functional form of the shape function. This is a significant
improvement over fits to model functions. Given any model for the shape
function, our construction gives an orthonormal basis in which the model occurs
as the first term, and corrections to it can be studied. We introduce a new
short distance scheme, the ""invisible scheme"", for the kinetic energy matrix
element, lambda_1. We obtain closed form results for the differential rates
that incorporate perturbative corrections and a summations of logarithms at any
order in perturbation theory, and present results using known
next-to-next-to-leading order expressions. The experimental implementation of

width, and molecular mass range from 0.01 to 0.09 pc, 0.43 to 3.33 km/s, and
0.5 to 54.1 Mo, respectively. Many cores with various line widths exist in one
clump, and the index of the line width-radius relationship of the cores and the
parental clump differs from core to core in the clump. This indicates that the
degree of dissipation of the turbulent motion varies for each core in one
clump. Although the mass of the cores increases with the line width, most cores
are gravitationally bound by the external pressure. In addition, the line width
and the external pressure of the cores tend to decrease with the distance from
the center of the clump, and these dependencies may be caused by the inner H2
density structure of the clump that affects the physical properties of the
cores. Moreover, the number density of the cores and the number density of
young (proto)stars have a similar relationship to the average H2 density of the
clumps. Thus, our findings suggest that the cluster is formed in the clump
through the formation of such multiple cores, whose physical properties would
have been strongly related to the H2 density structure and the turbulent motion

geometry has the effect of increasing the estimated flare heights by a factor
of ~3. These predictions are consistent with those derived using results of
flaring loop models, which are also used to estimate the flaring loop
properties and energetics. From loop models we estimate a flare loop height of
0.13 R_*, plasma density of ~4 * 10^12 cm^-3 and emitting volume of ~6 * 10^30

dominant nonthermal jet components, there is a growing body of evidence that
suggests that thermal emission is observable even in the most highly beamed
objects. The emitting regions, which can include the accretion disk as well as
the torus, are key parts of the central engine which also powers the jets. They
also may be of critical importance in helping us decide between unified scheme
models. We will review the observational evidence for thermal emissions in
blazars, with an emphasis on recent work, and the spectral and variability
characteristics that have been observed. The majority of the evidence for
thermal emission in blazars (now observed in several objects) has come as a
result of multiwavelength campaigns, where the object showed a clear bump in
the optical-UV in a faint state. However, evidence exists from other avenues as
well, including both purely spectral and variability based arguments as well as
statistical analyses of large samples of objects. We will also discuss the
impact of thermal emission on an object's overall SED, including its
Comptonized signatures. Finally, we will assess the current standing of unified

thermal emission with new telescopes and missions, and further utilizing it as

principles and generalized uncertainty principles. We generalized
""Landau-Pollak-Slepian"" uncertainty principle. Our generalization relates the
following two quantities and two scaling parameters: 1) The weighted time
spreading $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2w_1(x)dx$, ($w_1(x)$ is a non-negative
function). 2) The weighted frequency spreading $\int_{-\infty}^\infty
|\hat{f}(\omega)|^2w_2(\omega)d\omega$. 3) The time weight scale $a$,
${w_1}_a(x)=w_1(xa^{-1})$ and 4) The frequency weight scale $b$,
${w_2}_b(\omega)=w_2(\omega b^{-1})$. ""Generalized Uncertainty Principle"" is an
inequality that summarizes the constraints on the relations between the two
spreading quantities and two scaling parameters. For any two reasonable weights
$w_1(x)$ and $w_2(\omega)$, we introduced a three dimensional set in $R^3$ that

""possibility body"". We showed that classical uncertainty principles (such as
the Heiseneberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle) stem from lower bounds for
different functions defined on the possibility body. We investigated
qualitative properties of general uncertainty principles and possibility
bodies. Using this approach we derived new (quantitative) uncertainty
principles for Landau-Pollak-Slepian weights. We found the general uncertainty
principles related to homogeneous weights, $w_1(x)=w_2(x)=x^k$, $k\in N$, up to

of late-type isolated disk galaxies likely host pseudobulges rather than

that the properties of the pseudobulges are strongly connected to those of the

processes within the disks (i.e. secular evolution) and that bars may play an
important role in their formation. Although the sample under investigation
covers a narrow morphological range, a clear separation between Sb and Sbc-Sc

have larger disks and larger bars, more luminous bulges, are more concentrated,

characteristic T2* times, the longer of which is temperature-independent and
the shorter is temperature-dependent, indicating that the latter is most likely
limited by spin-phonon interaction. Based on the measured data, we infer that
the single particle T2 time is long enough to meet Knill's criterion for fault

Moreover, we found that the temperature-dependent T2* time is considerably
shorter in bulk Alq3 powder than in few molecules confined in 1-2 nm sized

This is very intriguing for organic molecules where carriers are always

  *RESULTS: Several correlations between the [OIII] 5007 line and 5-GHz radio

strongly related to the GPS/CSS source size indicating that the [OIII] 5007

Shocks are the most likely enhancing mechanism, although jet-induced star

artificial ruggedness exists for short cutoffs and gradually disappears with
the cutoff increase. The critical values of the cutoff were calculated for each
of eleven popular power-type potentials with n=0-9, 12 and for two thresholds
of 5% and 10%. The artificial ruggedness decreases to tolerable thresholds for
cutoffs longer than the critical ones. The results showed that for both
thresholds the critical cutoff is a non-monotonic function of the potential
power n. The functions reach the maximum at n=3-4 and then decrease with the
increase of the potential power. The difference between two cutoffs for 5% and
10% artificial ruggedness becomes negligible for potentials decreasing faster
than 1/r^12. The results suggest that cutoffs longer than critical ones can be

close passages near the SMBH, leaving behind a single S star on a much tighter

simultaneously providing an explanation for the observed hypervelocity stars in

redshift interval 0.7<z<1.4, by combining deep Chandra observations with
extensive optical spectroscopy from the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip
International Survey (AEGIS). The sample consists of 3902 optical sources and
71 X-ray AGN. Compared to the overall optically selected galaxy population,
X-ray AGN are more frequently found in groups at the 99% confidence level. This
is partly because AGN are hosted by red luminous galaxies, which are known to
reside, on average, in dense environments. Relative to these sources, the
excess of X-ray AGN in groups is significant at the 91% level only. Restricting
the sample to 0.7<z<0.9 and M_B<-20mag in order to control systematics we find
that X-ray AGN represent (4.7\pm1.6) and (4.5\pm1.0)% of the optical galaxy
population in groups and in the field respectively. These numbers are
consistent with the AGN fraction in low redshift clusters, groups and the
field. The results above, although affected by small number statistics, suggest
that X-ray AGN are spread over a range of environments, from groups to the
field, once the properties of their hosts (e.g. colour, luminosity) are
accounted for. There is also tentative evidence, significant at the 98% level,
that the field produces more X-ray luminous AGN compared to groups, extending
similar results at low redshift to z~1. This trend may be because of either

parameter MCMC sampler. As a worked example we apply these techniques to the
model recently introduced by Ackerman et al., describing for instance
violations of rotational invariance during the inflationary epoch. After
verifying the code with simulated data, we analyze the foreground-reduced
5-year WMAP temperature sky maps. For l <= 400 and the W-band data, we find
tentative evidence for a preferred direction pointing towards (l,b) = (110 deg,
10 deg) with an anisotropy amplitude of g_* = 0.15 +/- 0.039. Similar results
are obtained from the V-band data [g_* = 0.10 +/- 0.04; (l,b) = (130 deg, 20

range, seen independently in both l=[2,100] and [100,400], although at lower
statistical significance. We have not yet been able to establish a fully
satisfactory explanation for the observations in terms of known systematics,

systematic 5D procedure also works. In doing so, it becomes important to
identify the correct 5D charges. In particular, we perform explicit
calculations for the black ring and 5D black hole. In the black ring analysis,
we find Chern-Simons induced spectral flow shifts emerging out of Sen's

invariant and the resulting electric charges are identified as Page charges.
For the black hole too, 5D gauge invariance is confirmed. Our 5D analysis
enables us to fix a mismatch that arose in the electric charges of Goldstein

e^0 - p^0 exchange in the entropy function as an interpolation between black

evolution of the BH spin parameter. We take into account the coupling between
BH mass, its spin parameter and the critical specific angular momentum of
accreting gas, needed for the torus to form. The large BH spin reduces the
critical angular momentum which in turn can increase the GRB duration with
respect to the Schwarzschild BH case. We quantify this effect and estimate the
GRB durations in three cases: when a hyper accreting torus operates or a BH
spins very fast or both. We show under what conditions a given progenitor star
produces a burst that can last as short as several seconds and as long as
several hundred of seconds. Our models indicate that it is possible for a
single collapse to produce three kinds of jets: (1) a very short, lasting
between a fraction of a second and a few seconds, 'precursor' jet, powered only
by a hyper accreting torus before the BH spins up, (2) an 'early' jet, lasting

The initial set of anti-reflection coated quartz and sapphire wave plates

the input parameters of our simulations with a focus on large-scale magnetic
field properties. As expected, attempts at trying to model the synchrotron,
UHECR deflection and RM input parameters, show that any additional
observational data set greatly increases the constraints on the models. The
hammurabi code addresses this by allowing to perform simulations of several
different data sets simultaneously, providing the means for a more reliable
constraint of the magnetized inter-stellar-medium.

simulations of quantum random walks (QRW). Specifically, in the case of a QRW
on the line with one particle (walker) and two entangled coins, we explain the
phenomenon, called ""localization"", whereby the probability distribution of the
walker's position is seen to exhibit a persistent major ""spike"" (or ""peak"") at
the initial position and two other minor spikes which drift to infinity in
either direction. Another interesting finding in connection with QRW's of this
sort pertains to the limiting behavior of the position probability
distribution. It is seen that the probability of finding the walker at any
given location becomes eventually stationary and non-vanishing. We explain
these observations in terms of the degeneration of some eigenvalue of the time
evolution operator $U(k)$. An explicit general formula is derived for the
limiting probability, from which we deduce the limiting value of the height of
the observed spike at the origin. We show that the limiting probability
decreases {\em quadratically} for large values of the position $x$. We locate
the two minor spikes and demonstrate that their positions are determined by the
phases of non-degenerated eigenvalues of $U(k)$. Finally, for fixed time $t$
sufficiently large, we examine the dependence on $t$ of the probability of
finding a particle at a given location $x$.

regime, which is, for example, a practically relevant mode of operation for the
analysis of ultrawideband (UWB) mesh networks. For this purpose, we study the
tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the
power-bandwidth tradeoff) in a wideband linear multihop network in which
transmissions employ orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation and are affected by quasi-static, frequency-selective fading.
Considering open-loop (fixed-rate) and closed-loop (rate-adaptive) multihop
relaying techniques, we characterize the impact of routing with spatial reuse
on the statistical properties of the end-to-end conditional mutual information
(conditioned on the specific values of the channel fading parameters and
therefore treated as a random variable) and on the energy and spectral
efficiency measures of the wideband regime. Our analysis particularly deals
with the convergence of these end-to-end performance measures in the case of
large number of hops, i.e., the phenomenon first observed in \cite{Oyman06b}
and named as ``multihop diversity''. Our results demonstrate the realizability
of the multihop diversity advantages in the case of routing with spatial reuse

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) shows a broad Lyman alpha emission line with a FWHM ~
500 km/s and a luminosity of L_{Lya} = 3.9e43 erg/s superposed on the trough of
the PDLA. Mechanisms for powering this large Lyman alpha luminosity are
discussed. We argue against emission from HII regions in the PDLA galaxy since
this requires an excessive star-formation rate ~ 500 Msun/yr and would
correspond to the largest Lyman alpha luminosity ever measured from a damped
Lyman alpha system or starburst galaxy. We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulation to investigate the possibility that the line emission is fluorescent
recombination radiation from the PDLA galaxy powered by the ionizing flux of
the quasar, but find that the predicted Lyman alpha flux is several orders of
magnitude lower than observed. We conclude that the Lyman alpha emission is not
associated with the PDLA galaxy at all, but instead is intrinsic to the
quasar's host and similar to the extended Lyman alpha 'fuzz' which is detected
around many AGN. PDLAs are natural coronagraphs that block their background
quasar at Lyman alpha, and we discuss how systems similar to
SDSSJ124020.91+145535.6 might be used to image the neutral hydrogen in the PDLA

whose members have an inner optically thick disk separated from an outer
optically thick disk by an optically thin gap. This is in contrast to the
""transitional disks"" which have inner disk holes (i.e. large reductions of
small dust from the star out to an outer optically thick wall). In LkCa 15, one
of these proposed pre-transitional disks, detailed modeling showed that
although the near-infrared fluxes could be understood in terms of optically
thick material at the dust sublimation radius, an alternative model of emission
from optically thin dust over a wide range of radii could explain the
observations as well. To unveil the true nature of LkCa 15's inner disk we
obtained a medium-resolution near-infrared spectrum spanning the wavelength
range 2-5 microns using SpeX at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We report
that the excess near-infrared emission above the photosphere of LkCa 15 is a
black-body continuum which can only be due to optically thick material in an
inner disk around the star. When this confirmation of a primordial inner disk
is combined with earlier observations of an inner edge to LkCa 15's outer disk
it reveals a gapped structure. Forming planets emerge as the most likely
mechanism for clearing the gap we detect in this evolving disk.

of quantifying the ionization history of the universe from the present epoch to

redshift of z >~ 6 the first collapsed objects, possibly dwarf galaxies,
emitted Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation shortward of 912 A, reionizing most of
the universe. How LyC escapes from galactic environments, whether it induces
positive or negative feedback on the local and global collapse of structures,
and the role played by clumping, molecules, metallicity and dust are major
unanswered theoretical questions, requiring observational constraint. Numerous
intervening Lyman limit systems, which frustrate the detection of LyC from high
z objects, thin below z ~ 3 where there are a few objects with apparently very
high fesc. At low z there are only controversial detections and a handful of
upper limits. A wide-field multi-object spectroscopic survey with moderate
spectral and spatial resolution can quantify fesc within diverse spatially
resolved galactic environments over redshifts with significant evolution in
galaxy assemblage and quasar activity. It can also calibrate LyC escape against
Ly-alpha escape, providing an essential tool to JWST for probing the beginnings
of reionization. We present calculations showing the evolution of the
characteristic apparent magnitude of star-forming galaxy luminosity functions
at 900 A, as a function of redshift and assumed escape fraction to determine
the required aperture for detecting LyC. We review our efforts to build a

reveal the multifractal properties of the fracture surfaces of foamed
polypropylene/polyethylene blends at different temperatures. Nice power-law
scaling relationship between the detrended fluctuation function $F_{q}$ and the
scale $s$ is observed for different orders $q$ and the scaling exponent $h(q)$
is found to be a nonlinear function of $q$, confirming the presence of
multifractality in the fracture surfaces. The multifractal spectra $f(\alpha)$
are obtained numerically through Legendre transform. The shape of the
multifractal spectrum of singularities can be well captured by the width of
spectrum $\Delta\alpha$ and the difference of dimension $\Delta f$. With the
increase of the PE content, the fracture surface becomes more irregular and
complex, as is manifested by the facts that $\Delta\alpha$ increases and
$\Delta f$ decreases from positive to negative. A qualitative interpretation is
provided based on the foaming process.

investigating the radial distribution of iron and other metals. We employed
FLAMES at VLT to collect UVES spectra of bright giant stars in a large sample
of open clusters, spanning a wide range of Galactocentric distances, ages, and
metallicities. We present here the results for four clusters: Berkeley 20 and
Berkeley 29, the two most distant clusters in the sample; Collinder 261, the
oldest and the one with the minimum Galactocentric distance; Melotte 66.
Equivalent width analysis was carried out using the spectral code MOOG and
Kurucz model atmospheres to derive abundances of Fe, Al, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Ni, Ba; non-LTE Na abundances were derived by direct line-profile fitting. We
obtain subsolar metallicities for the two anticenter clusters Be 20
([Fe/H]=-0.30, rms=0.02) and Be 29 ([Fe/H]=-0.31, rms=0.03), and for Mel 66
([Fe/H]=-0.33, rms=0.03), located in the third Galactic quadrant, while Cr 261,
located toward the Galactic center, has higher metallicity ([Fe/H]=+0.13,
rms=0.05 dex). The alpha-elements Si, Ca and Ti, and the Fe-peak elements Cr
and Ni are in general close to solar; the s-process element Ba is enhanced.
Non-LTE computations of Na abundances indicate solar scaled values, suggesting
that the enhancement in Na previously determined in giants in open clusters
could be due to neglected non-LTE effects. Our results support the presence of
a steep negative slope of the Fe radial gradient up to about 10-11 kpc from the
Galactic center, while in the outer disk the [Fe/H] distribution seems flat.
All the elemental ratios measured are in very good agreement with those found
for disk stars of similar metallicity and no trend with Galactocentric distance
seems to be present.

comparison to a unitary equivalent Hyperspherical Harmonic expansion.
Furthermore, we compare and discuss two different possible choices for
describing the asymptotic configurations of the system, related to the use of
Jacobi or hyperspherical coordinates. In order to illustrate the difficulties
and advantages of the approach two simple numerical applications are shown in
the case of neutron-deuteron scattering at low energies using s-wave
interactions. We found that the optimization driven by the Hyperspherical
Adiabatic basis is not as efficient for scattering states as in bound state
applications.

inflationary scenario and avoids the monopole puzzle. Based on the spontaneous
symmetry breaking pattern (with three steps), the $F$-term inflation is
derived. The slow-roll parameters $\ep$ and $\eta$ are calculated. By imposing
as experimental five-year WMAP data on the spectral index $n$, we have derived
a constraint on the number of e-folding $N_Q$ to be in the range from 25 to 50.
The scenario for large-scale structure formation implied by the model is a
mixed scenario for inflation and cosmic string, and the contribution to the
CMBR temperature anisotropy depends on the ratio $\frac{M_X}{M_P}$. From the
COBE data, we have obtained the constraint on the $M_X$ to be $M_X\in[1.22
\times 10^{16} - 0.98 \times 10^{17}]$ GeV. The upper value $M_X\simeq 10^{17}$
GeV is a result of the analysis in which the inflationary contribution to the
temperature fluctuations measured by the COBE is 90%. The coupling $\alpha$
varies in the range: $ 10^{-7} - 10^{-1} $. This value is not so small, and it
is a common characteristics of the supersymmetric unified models with the
inflationary scenario. The spectral index $n$ is a little bit smaller than
0.98. The SUGRA corrections are slightly different from the previous
consideration. When $\xi \ll 1$ and $ \al $ lies in the above range, the
spectral index gets the value consistent with the experimental five-year WMAP
data. Comparing with string theory, one gets $\xi < 10^{-8}$. Numerical
analysis shows that $ \al \approx 10^{-6}$. To get inflation contribution to
the CMBR temperature anisotropy $\approx 90%$, the mass scale $M_X \sim 3.5

model, on the basis of the available observations of Type Ia supernovae. We
also computed the Type Ia supernova rate in typical elliptical galaxies of
different initial luminous masses and the total amount of iron produced by Type
Ia supernovae in each case. It emerges that: it is not easy to select the best
delay time distribution scenario from the observational data and this is
because the cosmic star formation rate dominates over the distribution function
of the delay times; the monolithic collapse scenario predicts an increasing
trend of the SN Ia rate at high redshifts whereas the predicted rate in the
hierarchical scheme drops dramatically at high redshift; for the elliptical
galaxies we note that the predicted maximum of the Type Ia supernova rate
depends on the initial galactic mass. The maximum occurs earlier (at about 0.3

formation. We find that different delay time distributions predict different

No other approach really alleviates the difficulties faced by the cosmological
constant because, in all other attempts to model the dark energy, one still has
to explain why the bulk cosmological constant (treated as a low-energy
parameter in the action principle) is zero. I argue that until the theory is
made invariant under the shifting of the Lagrangian by a constant, one cannot
obtain a satisfactory solution to the cosmological constant problem. This is
impossible in any generally covariant theory with the conventional low-energy
matter action, if the metric is varied in the action to obtain the field
equations. I review an alternative perspective in which gravity arises as an
emergent, long wavelength phenomenon and can be described in terms of an
effective theory using an action associated with null vectors in the spacetime.
This action is explicitly invariant under the shift of the energy momentum
tensor $T_{ab}\to T_{ab}+\Lambda g_{ab}$ and any bulk cosmological constant can
be gauged away. Such an approach seems to be necessary for addressing the
cosmological constant problem and can easily explain why its bulk value is
zero. I describe some possibilities for obtaining its observed value from
quantum gravitational fluctuations.

the momentum transfer and the lepton mass can be precisely measured. Until now,
the most stringent bounds on the $\tau$ magnetic moment $a_\tau$ come from LEP
data with strong assumptions on the physics involved on the observed process.
In this paper, we find three different combinations of spin correlations of the
outgoing Taus that disentangle the magnetic moment form factor of the Tau
lepton in the electromagnetic vertex. These combinations of asymmetries also
get rid off the contributions coming from Z-mediating amplitudes to the defined
correlations. Using unpolarized electron beams and an integrated luminosity of
$15 \times 10^{18} b^{-1}$, the sensitivity to the $\tau$ magnetic moment form
factor is of the order $10^{-6}$. This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude
better than the present existing high- or low-energy bounds on the magnetic
moment and would allow its actual measurement with the precision of a few per

constraint programming to express the constraint store. Finally, CPBPV is
parametrized with a list of solvers which are tried in sequence, starting with
the least expensive and less general. Experimental results often produce orders

a chiral transformation. These currents can be called chiral partners at the
fundamental level. In a world where chiral symmetry was not broken, the
corresponding current-current correlators would show the same spectral
information. In the real world chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. A
prominent peak -- the rho-meson -- shows up in the vector spectrum (measured in
(e^+ e^-)-collisions and tau-decays). On the other hand, in the axial-vector
spectrum a broad bump appears -- the a_1-meson (also accessible in tau-decays).
It is tempting to call rho and a_1 chiral partners at the hadronic level.
Strong indications are brought forward that these ``chiral partners'' do not
only differ in mass but even in their nature: The rho-meson appears dominantly
as a quark-antiquark state with small modifications from an attractive
pion-pion interaction. The a_1-meson, on the other hand, can be understood as a
meson-molecule state mainly formed by the attractive interaction between pion
and rho-meson. A key issue here is that the meson-meson interactions are fixed
by chiral symmetry breaking. It is demonstrated that one can understand the
vector and the axial-vector spectrum very well within this interpretation. It
is also shown that the opposite cases, namely rho as a pion-pion molecule or
a_1 as a quark-antiquark state lead to less satisfying results. Finally
speculations on possible in-medium changes of hadron properties are presented.

equation of state is analyzed within an exactly solvable model. It is argued
that the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in
the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy
QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states in a hadronic phase.
The model allows us to estimate the minimal value of the width of QGP bags from
a variety of the lattice QCD data and get that the minimal resonance width at
zero temperature is about 600 MeV, whereas the minimal resonance width at the
Hagedorn temperature is about 2000 MeV. As shown these estimates are almost
insensitive to the number of the elementary degrees of freedom. The recent
lattice QCD data are analyzed and it is found that besides sigma T**4 term the
lattice QCD pressure contains T-linear and T**4 ln T terms in the range of
temperatures between 240 MeV and 420 MeV. The presence of the last term in the
pressure bears almost no effect on the width estimates. Our analysis shows that
at hight temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in
accordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear
asymptotics), whereas at low temperatures they obey the lower bound of the
Regge trajectory asymptotics (the square root one). Since the model explicitly
contains the Hagedorn mass spectrum, it allows us to remove an existing
contradiction between the finite number of hadronic Regge families and the
Hagedorn idea of the exponentially growing mass spectrum of hadronic bags.

recent CO observations. However, our distance determination is more than an
order of magnitude smaller than previous analyses which inaccurately
interpreted the optical spectrum. To accurately model the infrared spectrum we
have extended our Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes to include emission from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and very small grains (VSG). We
do this using pre-computed PAH/VSG emissivity files for a wide range of values
of the mean intensity of the exciting radiation field. When Monte Carlo energy
packets are absorbed by PAHs/VSGs we reprocess them to other wavelengths by
sampling from the emissivity files, thus simulating the absorption and
re-emission process without reproducing lengthy computations of statistical
equilibrium, excitation and de-excitation in the complex many level molecules.
Using emissivity lookup tables in our Monte Carlo codes gives the flexibility
to use the latest grain physics calculations of PAH/VSG emissivity and opacity
that are being continually updated in the light of higher resolution infrared
spectra. We find our approach gives a good representation of the observed PAH
spectrum from the disk of Gomez's Hamburger. Our models also indicate the
PAHs/VSGs in the disk have a larger scaleheight than larger radiative
equilibrium grains, providing evidence for dust coagulation and settling to the
midplane.

non-specialists and discuss techniques for simulating and optimising images of
flux vortices. Sample preparation is discussed in detail as the requirement for
samples with very large (>10um), flat areas so that the image is not dominated
by diffraction contrast is the main difficulty with the technique. We have
imaged vortices in superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d and use correlation
functions to investigate the ordered arrangements they adopt as a function of
applied magnetic field.

reaction at 115 AMeV using a secondary triton beam produced via fast
fragmentation of 150 AMeV 16O ions. Compared to previous (t,3He) experiments at
this energy that employed a primary alpha beam, the secondary beam intensity is
improved by about a factor of five. Despite the large emittance of the
secondary beam, an excitation-energy resolution of ~200 keV is achieved. A good
correspondence is found between the extracted Gamow-Teller strength
distribution and those available from other charge-exchange probes. Theoretical
calculations using the newly developed USDA and USDB sd-shell model
interactions reproduce the data well.

Chandra X-ray Observatory to study its faint X-ray populations. Five X-ray
sources were found inside the cluster core radius, including the known
eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1953+1846A. The X-ray light
curve of the source coincident with this MSP shows marginal evidence for
periodicity at the binary period of 4.2 h. Its hard X-ray spectrum and
luminosity resemble those of other eclipsing binary MSPs in 47 Tuc, suggesting
a similar shock origin of the X-ray emission. A further 24 X-ray sources were
found within the half-mass radius, reaching to a limiting luminosity of 1.5
10^30 erg/s (0.3-8 keV). From a radial distribution analysis, we find that
18+/-6 of these 29 sources are associated with M71, somewhat more than
predicted, and that 11+/-6 are background sources, both galactic and
extragalactic. M71 appears to have more X-ray sources between L_X=10^30--10^31
erg/s than expected by extrapolating from other studied clusters using either
mass or collision frequency. We explore the spectra and variability of these
sources, and describe the results of ground-based optical counterpart searches.

fact that strategies form a sheaf.
