the brightest high-redshift submillimeter galaxies known: GN20 and AzTEC1 at
0.8 and 0.3 arcsec resolution respectively. Our data - the highest resolution
submillimeter imaging of high redshift sources accomplished to date - was
collected in three different array configurations: compact, extended, and very
extended. We derive angular sizes of 0.6 and 1.0 arcsec for GN20 and 0.3 and
0.4 arcsec for AzTEC1 from modeling their visibility functions as a Gaussian
and elliptical disk respectively. Because both sources are B-band dropouts,
they likely lie within a relatively narrow redshift window around z~4, which
indicates their angular extent corresponds to physical scales of 4-8 and 1.5-3
kpc respectively for the starburst region. By way of a series of simple
assumptions, we find preliminary evidence that these hyperluminous starbursts -
with star formation rates >1000 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ - are radiating at or close
to their Eddington limit. Should future high resolution observations indicate
that these two objects are typical of a population of high redshift
Eddington-limited starbursts, this could have important consequences for models
of star formation and feedback in extreme environments.

transition to an excited WIMP state ~ 100 keV above the ground state, provides
a compelling explanation of the DAMA annual modulation signal. We demonstrate
that the relative sensitivities of various dark matter direct detection
experiments are modified such that the DAMA annual modulation signal can be
reconciled with the absence of a reported signal at CDMS-Soudan, XENON10,
ZEPLIN, CRESST, and KIMS for inelastic WIMPs with masses O(100 GeV). We review
the status of these experiments, and make predictions for upcoming ones. In
particular, we note that inelastic dark matter leads to highly suppressed
signals at low energy, with most events typically occurring between 20 to 45
keV (unquenched) at xenon and iodine experiments, and generally no events at
low (~ 10 keV) energies. Suppressing the background in this high energy region
is essential to testing this scenario. The recent CRESST data suggest seven
observed tungsten events, which is consistent with expectations from this
model. If the tungsten signal persists at future CRESST runs, it would provide
compelling evidence for inelastic dark matter, while its absence should exclude
it.

TaylorT4, and TaylorF2 (3.5PN) families, have FF <~ 0.97 and substantial biases
for the estimated total-mass against the fiducial TaylorEt (3.5PN) signals for

high FFs against those same template banks, but at the expense of inviting
large systematic errors in the estimated values of their total mass and
symmetric mass-ratio. In general, the aforementioned templates are found to be
increasingly {\it unfaithful} with respect to a TaylorEt signal as one
increases the total mass of the inspiraling system. We also observe that the
amount of bias in the estimated mass varies with the (noise power spectral

behavior of the model when defined in lattices with different symmetries and

and, while differences were observed regarding dimensionality changes,
qualitative behavior was preserved. A further investigation was conducted into
primary infection and sensitiveness of the latency period to variations of the

characterizing primary infection and the latency period exhibited power-law
behavior when the stochastic parameters varied over a few orders of magnitude.
The power-law exponents were approximately the same when lattice symmetry
varied, but there was a significant variation when dimensionality changed from
two to three. The dynamics of the three-dimensional model was also shown to be
insensitive to variations of the deterministic parameters related to cell
resistance to the infection, and the necessary time lag to mount the specific

flat parallel faces of two transparent dielectrics by means of an explicitly
causal and retarded propagator constructed directly from the free-space wave
equation. Nevertheless, our approach yields apparently superluminal propagation
for the case of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR), that is, a
transmitted wave packet appears on the far side of the gap at the same time
that the corresponding incident packet crosses the front one. Thus, in this
example superluminality is just an illusion, being consistent with both
casuality and classical electrodynamics. We study the origin of the apparent
superluminality in this case, which is inherent to light pulse propagation in
free space and does not depend on the particulars of light-matter interaction,
and find that it is due to propagation from the lateral wings of the incident
pulse to the central part of the transmitted pulse. Thus, notwithstanding their
similarities, FTIR is not equivalent to 1D tunneling. We propose experiments to
test our explanation of superluminality using opaque screens to block part of
the wavefront, although we demonstrate that the propagation of smooth finite
pulses constrained to be made up completely of evanescent Fourier components is
indistinguishable from truly superluminal propagation, i.e., it may be
completely accounted for using an explicitely superluminal and acausal
propagator as well as the causal subluminal one.

Hill radius of the nuclear ring, which is typically 20-30% of its radius.
Massive star clusters can reach half of this separation very quickly and
produce a factor of a few enhancement in the gas surface density. If this leads
to star formation in addition to the (ongoing) formation of star clusters near

fluid reveal the existence of regular collective perturbations associated with
the smallest positive Lyapunov exponents of the system, called hydrodynamic
Lyapunov modes, which previously could only be identified in hard-core fluids.
In this work we present a systematic study of the Lyapunov exponents and
Lyapunov vectors, i.e. perturbations along each direction of phase space, of a
three-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid. By performing the Fourier transform of
the spatial density of the coordinate part of the Lyapunov vector components
and then time-averaging this result we find convincing signatures of
longitudinal modes, with inconclusive evidence of transverse modes for all
studied densities. Furthermore, the longitudinal modes can be more clearly
identified for the higher density values. Thus, according to our results, the
mixing of modes induced both by the dynamics and the dimensionality induce a
hitherto unknown type of order in the tangent space of the model herein studied
at high density values.

the magnitude of the intraatomic interaction \textit{U}) are determined
explicitly in the correlated state for the electronic systems of various
symmetries and dimensions: Hubbard chain, square and triangular planar

of the electronic properties as a function of interatomic distance $R$ is
obtained. The model parameters in most cases do not scale linearly with the
lattice spacing and hence, their solution as a function of microscopic

(by making use of the Lieb--Wu solution) and compared with the approximate
Gutzwiller treatment. In higher dimensions (\textit{D} = 2, 3) only the latter

events. It plays both a passive role, observing quantum systems, and an active
one, preparing quantum states and controlling them. Surprisingly - in the light
of the central status of measurement in quantum mechanics - there is no general
recipe for designing a detector that measures a given observable. Compounding
this, the characterization of existing detectors is typically based on partial
calibrations or elaborate models. Thus, experimental specification (i.e.
tomography) of a detector is of fundamental and practical importance. Here, we
present the realization of quantum detector tomography: we identify the optimal
positive-operator-valued measure describing the detector, with no ancillary
assumptions. This result completes the triad, state, process, and detector
tomography, required to fully specify an experiment. We characterize an
avalanche photodiode and a photon number resolving detector capable of
detecting up to eight photons. This creates a new set of tools for accurately

impact of quasar photo-heating during HeII reionisation on the thermal
evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We demonstrate that rapid (\Delta
z< 0.1-0.2), strong (\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve
across the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than
implied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic
quasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess
energy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and
lowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals
shorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons
responsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy
inside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and
model-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating
rates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and
weakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be
reionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest
heating rates (\Delta T < 10^4 K). The repeated ionisation of fossil quasar
HeIII regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination times
in these regions typically exceed the IGM cooling times and the average time
lag between successive rounds of quasar activity. Detailed line-of-sight
radiative transfer simulations confirm these expectations and predict a rich
thermal structure in the IGM during HeII reionisation. [Abridged]

determine a total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.002 Msun (114+/-2 Mjup). The flux
ratio is near unity, so both components are unambiguously substellar for any
plausible mass ratio. An independent constraint on the age of the system is
available from the G2V primary HD 130948A. The available indicators suggest an
age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79 Gyr based on
gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is now a unique benchmark among field L
and T dwarfs, with a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. We find that
substellar theoretical models disagree with our observations. Both components
of HD 130948BC appear to be overluminous by a factor of ~2-3x compared to
evolutionary models. The age of the system would have to be notably younger
than the gyro age to ameliorate the luminosity disagreement. However,
regardless of the adopted age, evolutionary and atmospheric models give
inconsistent results, indicating systematic errors in at least one class of
models, possibly both. The masses of HD 130948BC happen to be very near the
theoretical mass limit for lithium burning, and thus measuring the differential
lithium depletion between B and C will provide a uniquely discriminating test
of theoretical models. The potential underestimate of luminosities by
evolutionary models would have wide-ranging implications; therefore, a more
refined age estimate for HD 130948A is critically needed.

correlated with the optical B, V and R bands, their fluctuations are almost
simultaneous with a delay consistent with 0 days and not larger than 4 days in

rapid, large amplitude fluctuations over tens of days in the X-rays have only
small counterparts in the optical bands, while the long-term trends over
hundreds of days are stronger in the B band than in X-rays. We show that simple
reprocessing models, where all the optical variability arises from the variable
X-ray heating, cannot simultaneously explain the discrepant variability
amplitudes on different time-scales and the short delays between X-ray and

95% level in each color range. We use this sample to derive the luminosity and
mass functions of low-mass stars over nearly a decade in mass (0.7 M_sun > M_*
> 0.1 M_sun). We find that the logarithmically binned mass function is best fit
with an M_c=0.29 log-normal distribution, with a 90% confidence interval of
M_c=0.20--0.50. These 90% confidence intervals correspond to linearly binned
mass functions peaking between 0.27 M_sun and 0.12 M_sun, where the best fit MF
turns over at 0.17 M_sun. A power law fit to the entire mass range sampled
here, however, returns a best fit of alpha=1.1 (where the Salpeter slope is
alpha = 2.35). These results agree well with most previous investigations,
though differences in the analytic formalisms adopted to describe those mass
functions can give the false impression of disagreement. Given the richness of
modern-day astronomical datasets, we are entering the regime whereby stronger
conclusions can be drawn by comparing the actual datapoints measured in
different mass functions, rather than the results of analytic analyses that

unique features of the inner region of the tilted disk simulations described in
Fragile et al. (2007). The primary new feature identified in the main disk body
is a latitude-dependent radial epicyclic motion driven by pressure gradients
attributable to the gravitomagnetic warping of the disk. The induced motion of
the gas is coherent over the scale of the entire disk and is fast enough that
it could be observable in features such as relativistic iron lines. The
eccentricity of the associated fluid element trajectories increases with
decreasing radius, leading to a crowding of orbit trajectories near their
apocenters. This results in a local density enhancement akin to a compression.
These compressions are sufficiently strong to produce a pair of weak shocks in
the vicinity of the black hole. These shocks are roughly aligned with the
line-of-nodes between the black-hole symmetry plane and disk midplane, with one
shock above the line-of-nodes on one side of the black hole and the other below
on the opposite side. These shocks enhance angular momentum transport and
energy dissipation near the hole, forcing some material to plunge toward the
black hole from well outside the innermost stable circular orbit. A new,
extended simulation, which was evolved for more than a full disk precession
period, allows us to confirm that these shocks and the previously identified
``plunging streams'' precess with the disk in such a way as to remain aligned
relative to the line-of-nodes, as expected based on our physical understanding
of these phenomena. Such a precessing structure would likely present a strong
quasi-periodic signal.

given, with emphasis on the nuclear physics aspects. After a brief review of
the neutrino oscillation results and of motivation to test the lepton number
conservation, the mechanism of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ is discussed. Its relation
to the lepton flavor violation involving charged leptons and its use as a
diagnostic tool of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ mechanism is described. Next the basic
nuclear physics of both $\beta\beta$-decay modes is presented, and the decay
rate formulae derived. The nuclear physics methods used, the nuclear shell
model and the quasiparticle random phase approximation, are described next, and
the choice of input parameters is discussed in the following section. Finally,
the numerical values of the nuclear matrix elements, and their uncertainty, are
presented. In the appendix the relation of the search for the neutrino magnetic
moment to the Dirac versus Majorana nature of neutrinos is described.

and that can be analyzed exactly or using controlled approximations. Employing
a mapping between quantum Hamiltonians and classical Fokker-Planck operators,
we show that the ground state wavefunction of the quantum model is proportional
to the Boltzmann measure of classical hard spheres. This connection allows us
to obtain quantitative results on static and dynamic quantum correlation

of Brownian hard spheres we work out the properties of the superglass phase and
of the quantum phase transition between the superfluid and the superglass

first use the normalized quadrupole for the whole sample (mean z=0.34) to
estimate $\beta=f(\Omega_m)/b=0.34 \pm 0.03$, where $f(\Omega_m)$ is the linear
velocity growth factor and $b$ is the linear bias parameter that relates galaxy

find $\Omega_{0m}= 0.245 \pm 0.020$ (h=0.72) and the biased amplitude $b

for satisfying local constraints on gravity, where this scale depends on

find that the chameleon mechanism can substantially suppress the enhancement of

comparable to or smaller than the depth of the gravitational potentials of
typical structures. Nonetheless power spectrum enhancements at intermediate
scales remain at a measurable level for models even when the expansion history
is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant, cold dark matter model.
Simple scaling relations that take the linear power spectrum into a non-linear

coupled to an optical microcavity. The spin current is generated by electron
tunneling between a single doped reservoir and the dot combined with intradot
spin flip transitions induced by a quantized cavity mode. In the limit of
strong Coulomb blockade, this model is analogous to the Jaynes-Cummings model
in quantum optics and generates a pure spin current in the absence of any
charge current. Earlier research has shown that in the classical limit where a
large number of such dots interact with the cavity field, the spin current
exhibits bistability as a function of the laser amplitude that drives the
cavity. We show that in the limit of a single quantum dot this bistability
continues to be present in the intracavity photon statistics. Signatures of the
bistable photon statistics manifest themselves in the frequency dependent shot
noise of the spin current despite the fact that the quantum mechanical average
spin current no longer exhibits bistability. Besides having significance for
future quantum dot based optoelectronic devices, our results shed light on the
relation between bistability, which is traditionally viewed as a classical
effect, and quantum mechanics.

inapproximability with factor roughly n^(1/(22d-10)) for every fixed d\ge 2, by
a conceptually very simple reduction. However, the proof of correctness
involves a nontrivial result in geometric topology (whose current proof is

reduction: assuming P \ne NP, no polynomial-time algorithm can distinguish
between spaces embeddable in R^d with constant distortion from spaces requiring
distortion at least n^(c/d), for a constant c>0. The exponent c/d has the
correct order of magnitude, since every n-point metric space can be embedded in

In contrast to conventional collaborative beamforming schemes in which each
source node uses channel state information to correct its local carrier offset
and channel phase, the proposed beamforming scheme opportunistically selects a
subset of source nodes whose received signals combine in a quasi-coherent
manner at the intended receiver. No local phase-precompensation is performed by
the nodes in the opportunistic collaborative beamformer. As a result, each node
requires only one-bit of feedback from the destination in order to determine if
it should or shouldn't participate in the collaborative beamformer. Theoretical
analysis shows that the received signal power obtained with the proposed
beamforming scheme scales linearly with the number of available source nodes.
Since the the optimal node selection rule requires an exhaustive search over
all possible subsets of source nodes, two low-complexity selection algorithms
are developed. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of opportunistic

about half of the stars have red absorptions and 1-micron veilings that are
consistent with dipole flows of moderate width with accretion shock filling
factors matching the size of the magnetospheric footpoints. However, the
remaining 50% of the profiles, with a combination of broad, deep absorption and
low 1-micron veiling, require very wide flows where magnetic footpoints are
distributed over 10-20% of the stellar surface but accretion shock filling
factors are < 1%. We model these profiles by invoking large magnetospheres
dilutely filled with accreting gas, leaving the disk over a range of radii in
many narrow ""streamlets"" that fill only a small fraction of the entire infall
region. In some cases accreting streamlets need to originate in the disk
between several stellar radii and at least the corotation radius. A few stars
have such deep absorption at velocities greater than half the stellar escape
velocity that flows near the star with less curvature than a dipole trajectory
seem to be required.

feature of AdS/CFT: it allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to
be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical
space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons at the

consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates and the behavior of
the QCD coupling in the infrared. We suggest that the spatial support of QCD
condensates is restricted to the interior of hadrons, since they arise due to
the interactions of confined quarks and gluons. Chiral symmetry is thus broken
in a limited domain of size of the inverse pion mass in analogy to the limited
physical extent of superconductor phases. A new method for computing the
hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level, an event

  considerations","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) has recently
reached the end of its fifth science run (S5), having collected more than a
year worth of data. Analysis of the data is still ongoing but a positive
detection of gravitational waves, while possible, is not realistically expected
for most likely sources. This is particularly true for what concerns
gravitational waves from known pulsars. In fact, even under the most optimistic
(and not very realistic) assumption that all the pulsar's observed spin-down is
due to gravitational waves, the gravitational wave strain at earth from all the
known isolated pulsars (with the only notable exception of the Crab pulsar)
would not be strong enough to be detectable by existing detectors. By August
2006, LIGO had produced enough data for a coherent integration capable to
extract signal from noise that was weaker than the one expected from the Crab
pulsar's spin-down limit. No signal was detected, but beating the spin-down
limit is a considerable achievement for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
(LSC). It is customary to translate the upper limit on strain from a pulsar
into a more astrophysically significant upper limit on ellipticity. Once the
spin-down limit has been beaten, it is possible to release the constraint that
all the spin-down is due to gravitational wave emission. A more complete model
with diverse braking mechanisms can be used to set limits on several
astrophysical parameters of the pulsar. This paper shows possible values of
such parameters for the Crab pulsar given the current limit on gravitational
waves from this neutron star.

total disk baryon mass of M31, which we have adopted to be $r_d$=5.5kpc and
$M_{tot} = 7\times 10^{10}$ \ms. It is found that, when the classical Kennicutt
star formation law was applied, the obtained radial profiles of gas surface
density and star formation rate (SFR) have great difference from the observed
results in M31 disk. Then we have adopted modified SFR as we did for the Milky
Way galaxy, that is the SFR is radial dependent. Detailed calculations show
that by adjusting the star formation efficiency, it is possible to get
reasonable gas and abundance profiles, but the total disk SFR is a factor of
2-3 higher than that estimated from observations. And also the predicted SFR
radial profile is also much higher than what GALEX observed in the outer part.

propose the use of hybrid auctions where an advertiser can make a
per-impression as well as a per-click bid, and the auctioneer then chooses one
of the two as the pricing mechanism. We assume that the advertiser and the
auctioneer both have separate beliefs (called priors) on the click-probability
of an advertisement. We first prove that the hybrid auction is truthful,
assuming that the advertisers are risk-neutral. We then show that this auction
is superior to the existing per-click auction in multiple ways: 1) It takes
into account the risk characteristics of the advertisers. 2) For obscure
keywords, the auctioneer is unlikely to have a very sharp prior on the
click-probabilities. In such situations, the hybrid auction can result in
significantly higher revenue. 3) An advertiser who believes that its
click-probability is much higher than the auctioneer's estimate can use
per-impression bids to correct the auctioneer's prior without incurring any
extra cost. 4) The hybrid auction can allow the advertiser and auctioneer to
implement complex dynamic programming strategies. As Internet commerce matures,
we need more sophisticated pricing models to exploit all the information held
by each of the participants. We believe that hybrid auctions could be an
important step in this direction.

determine for each v, the set I(v), consisting of all possible pairs (m,n) such
that there exist two Steiner triple systems of order v whose intersection has n
blocks over m points. We show that for v = 1 or 3 (mod 6), |I(v)| = Omega(v^3),
where previous results only imply that |I(v)| = Omega(v^2).

crystalline silicate grains a few microns in size. About 50% of the objects
with disks do not show near-IR excess emission, having ""transitional"" disks,
according to their classical definition. This is a very high fraction for such
a young cluster. The large number of ""transitional"" disks suggests lifetimes
comparable to the lifetimes of typical optically thick disks. Therefore, these
disks may not be in a short-lived phase, intermediate between Class II and
Class III objects. The median spectral energy distribution of the disks in the
Coronet cluster is also closer to a flat disk than observed for the disks
around solar-type stars in regions with similar age. The differences in the
disk morphology and evolution in the Coronet cluster could be related to fact
that these objects have very late spectral types compared to the solar-type

theories, where space-time is placed on the same footing as the other fields in
the theory, the representation of space-time diffeomorphisms provides a very
convenient scheme for analyzing the induced twisted deformation of these
diffeomorphisms, as a result of the space-time noncommutativity. However, for
gauge field theories (and of course also for canonical geometrodynamics) where
the Poisson brackets of the constraints explicitely depend on the embedding
variables, this Poisson algebra cannot be connected directly with a
representation of the complete Lie algebra of space-time diffeomorphisms,
because not all the field variables turn out to have a dynamical character
[Isham C.J., Kuchar K.V., Ann. Physics 164 (1985), 288-315, 316-333].
Nonetheless, such an homomorphic mapping can be recuperated by first modifying
the original action and then adding additional constraints in the formalism in
order to retrieve the original theory, as shown by Kuchar and Stone for the
case of the parametrized Maxwell field in [Kuchar K.V., Stone S.L., Classical
Quantum Gravity 4 (1987), 319-328]. Making use of a combination of all of these
ideas, we are therefore able to apply our canonical reparametrization approach
in order to derive the deformed Lie algebra of the noncommutative space-time

Bose gas, while the higher order virial coefficients contain effects arising
from the interaction. The same picture can be drawn in a quantum mechanical

mass and centre of charge of an elementary particle, are the same point. This
presumes some particular relationship between the charge and mass distribution,
a feature which cannot be checked experimentally. In this paper we give three
different kinds of arguments suggesting that, if assumed different points, the
centre of charge of an elementary spinning particle moves in a helical motion
at the speed of light, and it thus satisfies, in general, a fourth order
differential equation. If assumed a kind of rigid body structure, it is
sufficient the description of the centre of charge to describe also the
evolution of the centre of mass and the rotation of the body. This assumption
of a separation betwen the centre of mass and centre of charge gives a
contribution to the spin of the system and also justifies the existence of a
magnetic moment produced by the relative motion of the centre of charge. This
corresponds to an improved model of a charged elementary particle, than the
point particle case. This means that a Lagrangian formalism for describing
elementary spinning particles has to depend, at least, up to the acceleration
of the position of the charge, to properly obtain fourth order dynamical
equations. This result is compared with the description of a classical Dirac
particle obtained from a general Lagrangian formalism for describing spinning

single parameter is varied through a critical point, where the ground state and
the first excited state become degenerate. When this parameter appears as a
coupling constant, these models can be understood as straight-line
interpolations between different Hamiltonians $H_{\rm I}$ and $H_{\rm F}$. For
finite-size realizations however, there will usually be a finite energy gap
between ground and first excited state. By slowly changing the coupling
constant through the point with the minimum energy gap one thereby has an
adiabatic algorithm that prepares the ground state of $H_{\rm F}$ from the
ground state of $H_{\rm I}$. The adiabatic theorem implies that in order to
obtain a good preparation fidelity the runtime $\tau$ should scale with the
inverse energy gap and thereby also with the system size. In addition, for open
quantum systems not only non-adiabatic but also thermal excitations are likely
to occur. It is shown that -- using only local Hamiltonians -- for the 1d
quantum Ising model and the cluster model in a transverse field the
conventional straight line path can be replaced by a series of straight-line
interpolations, along which the fundamental energy gap is always greater than a
constant independent on the system size. The results are of interest for
adiabatic quantum computation since strong similarities between adiabatic
quantum algorithms and quantum phase transitions exist.

the ground-based new-technology telescopes such as GEMINI, VLT, and TNG, and
will also be used to provide support for the JWST and Gaia space missions as

the astronomical community. A magnitude-limited (R=18.0) version, GSC2.2, was
distributed soon after its production in 2001, while the GSC2.3 release has
been available for general access since 2007.
  The GSC2.3 catalog described in this paper contains astrometry, photometry,
and classification for 945,592,683 objects down to the magnitude limit of the
plates. Positions are tied to the ICRS; for stellar sources, the all-sky
average absolute error per coordinate ranges from 0.2"" to 0.28"" depending on
magnitude. When dealing with extended objects, astrometric errors are 20% worse
in the case of galaxies and approximately a factor of 2 worse for blended
images. Stellar photometry is determined to 0.13-0.22 mag as a function of
magnitude and photographic passbands (B,R,I). Outside of the galactic plane,
stellar classification is reliable to at least 90% confidence for magnitudes
brighter than R=19.5, and the catalog is complete to R=20.

(2) Ballistic spin transport, when spin is transported without losses simply
because sources of dissipation are very weak. (3) Equilibrium spin currents,

Since superfluidity is frequently connected with Bose condensation, recent
debates about magnon Bose condensation are also reviewed. For any type of spin
currents simplest models were chosen for discussion in order to concentrate on
concepts rather than details of numerous models. The various hurdles on the way
of using the concept of spin current (absence of the spin-conservation law,

is that the spin-current concept can be developed in a fully consistent manner,

directly against X-ray observations of galaxy clusters, we develop a method of
extracting statistical information about the three-dimensional properties of
the fluctuations from the two-dimensional X-ray surface brightness.
  We first create a set of synthetic clusters with lognormal fluctuations.
Performing mock observations of these synthetic clusters, we find that the
resulting X-ray surface brightness fluctuations also follow the lognormal
distribution fairly well. Systematic analysis of the synthetic clusters
provides an empirical relation between the density fluctuations and the X-ray
surface brightness. We analyze \chandra observations of the galaxy cluster
Abell 3667, and find that its X-ray surface brightness fluctuations follow the
lognormal distribution. While the lognormal model was originally motivated by
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, this is the first observational
confirmation of the lognormal signature in a real cluster. Finally we check the
synthetic cluster results against clusters from cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations. As a result of the complex structure exhibited by simulated
clusters, the empirical relation shows large scatter. Nevertheless we are able
to reproduce the true value of the fluctuation amplitude of simulated clusters
within a factor of two from their X-ray surface brightness alone.
  Our current methodology combined with existing observational data is useful
in describing and inferring the statistical properties of the three dimensional
inhomogeneity in galaxy clusters.

depend on each other, the radiative processes behave significantly differently
depending on the energy regime, and finally due to the enormous difference in

the time-dependent simulations that overcomes these problems. The processes
taken into account are Compton scattering, electron-positron pair production
and annihilation, Coulomb scattering as well as synchrotron emission and
absorption. No approximation has been made on the corresponding rates. For the
first time, we solve coupled integro-differential kinetic equations for photons

energies. A numerical scheme is proposed to guarantee energy conservation when
dealing with synchrotron processes in electron and photon equations. We apply
the code to model non-thermal pair cascades in the blackbody radiation field,
to study the synchrotron self-absorption as particle thermalization mechanism,
and to simulate time evolution of stochastically heated pairs and corresponding
synchrotron self-Compton photon spectra which might be responsible for the
prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts. Good agreement with previous works is
found in the parameter regimes where comparison is feasible, with the
differences attributable to our improved treatment of the microphysics.

covariance matrix $\Gamma$. Our aim is to estimate both $s$ and the entries
$\sigma_i=\Gamma_{i,i}$, for $i=1,...,n$, on the basis of the observation of
two independent copies of $Y$. Our approach is free of any prior assumption on
$s$ but requires that we know some upper bound $\gamma$ on the ratio
$\max_i\sigma_i/\min_i\sigma_i$. For example, the choice $\gamma=1$ corresponds
to the homoscedastic case where the components of $Y$ are assumed to have
common (unknown) variance. In the opposite, the choice $\gamma>1$ corresponds
to the heteroscedastic case where the variances of the components of $Y$ are
allowed to vary within some range. Our estimation strategy is based on model
selection. We consider a family $\{S_m\times\Sigma_m, m\in\mathcal{M}\}$ of
parameter sets where $S_m$ and $\Sigma_m$ are linear spaces. To each
$m\in\mathcal{M}$, we associate a pair of estimators
$(\hat{s}_m,\hat{\sigma}_m)$ of $(s,\sigma)$ with values in
$S_m\times\Sigma_m$. Then we design a model selection procedure in view of
selecting some $\hat{m}$ among $\mathcal{M}$ in such a way that the Kullback
risk of $(\hat{s}_{\hat{m}},\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{m}})$ is as close as possible to
the minimum of the Kullback risks among the family of estimators
$\{(\hat{s}_m,\hat{\sigma}_m), m\in\mathcal{M}\}$. Then we derive uniform rates
of convergence for the estimator $(\hat{s}_{\hat{m}},\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{m}})$

silent intervals. This phenomenon is called burst firing. To analyze burst
activity in an insect system, grasshopper auditory receptor neurons were
recorded in vivo for several distinct stimulus types. The experimental data
show that both burst probability and burst characteristics are strongly
influenced by temporal modulations of the acoustic stimulus. The tendency to
burst, hence, is not only determined by cell-intrinsic processes, but also by
their interaction with the stimulus time course. We study this interaction
quantitatively and observe that bursts containing a certain number of spikes
occur shortly after stimulus deflections of specific intensity and duration.
Our findings suggest a sparse neural code where information about the stimulus
is represented by the number of spikes per burst, irrespective of the detailed
interspike-interval structure within a burst. This compact representation
cannot be interpreted as a firing-rate code. An information-theoretical
analysis reveals that the number of spikes per burst reliably conveys
information about the amplitude and duration of sound transients, whereas their
time of occurrence is reflected by the burst onset time. The investigated
neurons encode almost half of the total transmitted information in burst
activity.

verbal enunciation of his first two laws. Derived equations are required to be
covariant, and a simplicity criterion requires that the four-vector force on a
charged particle be linearly related to the four-vector velocity. The
connecting tensor has derivable symmetry properties and contains the electric
and magnetic field vectors. The Lorentz force law emerges, and Maxwell's
equations for free space emerge with the assumption that the tensor and its
dual must both satisfy first order partial differential equations. The
inhomogeneous extension yields a charge density and a current density as being
the source of the field, and yields the law of conservation of charge. Newton's
third law is reinterpreted as a reciprocity statement, which requires that the
charge in the source term can be taken as the same physical entity as that of
the test particle and that both can be assigned the same units. Requiring
covariance under either spatial inversions or time reversals precludes magnetic
charge being a source of electromagnetic fields that exert forces on electric

neutrinos both involve compact objects and matter moving at relativistic
speeds. GW emission requires a departure from spherical symmetry, which is the
case if clumps of matter are accreted around black holes or neutron stars, and
ejected in relativistic jets, where neutrinos are believed to be produced. Both
messengers interact weakly with the surrounding matter, hence point directly to
the heart of the engines that power these emissions. Coincidences between GW
interferometers (e.g. Virgo) and HE neutrino telescopes (e.g. Antares) would
then give a unique insight on the physics of the most powerful objects in the
Universe. The possibility, observability and detectability for such GW/HE
neutrino coincidences are analysed.

The model under consideration is specified by assuming that the log--likelihood
function of two unknown densities is of some parametric form. The model has
been extended to cover multiple samples problems while its theoretical
properties have been investigated using large sample theory. A main application
of the density ratio model is testing whether two, or more, distributions are
equal. We extend these results by arguing that the penalized maximum empirical
likelihood estimator has less mean square error than that of the ordinary
maximum likelihood estimator, especially for small samples. In fact,
penalization resolves any existence problems of estimators and a modified Wald
type test statistic can be employed for testing equality of the two
distributions. A limited simulation study supports further the theory.

theorems for multigrid methods (MGMs). In particular, we are interested in
optimality that is a convergence speed independent of the size of the involved
matrices. For elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), a well known
optimality result requires that the sum of the orders of the grid transfer
operators is not lower than the order of the PDE to solve. Analogously, when
dealing with MGMs for Toeplitz matrices in the literature an optimality
condition on the position and on the order of the zeros of the symbols of the
grid transfer operators has been found. In this work we show that in the case
of elliptic PDEs with constant coefficients, the two different approaches lead
to an equivalent condition. We argue that the analysis for Toeplitz matrices is
an algebraic generalization of the LFA, which allows to deal not only with
differential problems but also for instance with integral problems. The
equivalence of the two approaches gives the possibility of using grid transfer
operators with different orders also for MGMs for Toeplitz matrices. We give
also a class of grid transfer operators related to the B-spline's refinement
equation and we study their geometric properties. This analysis suggests
further links between wavelets and multigrid methods. A numerical
experimentation confirms the correctness of the proposed analysis.

hot Jupiter planet (55 Cnc b) at 0.11 AU, and at least 3 more distant planets.
The polarisation of this system is very stable, showing no sign of the periodic
variations that would be expected if a short period planet were detected. The
measured standard deviation of the night averaged Stokes Q/I and U/I parameters
is 2.2x10^{-6}. We derive upper limits on the geometric albedo, A_G and
planetary radius using Monte Carlo multiple scattering simulations of a simple
model atmosphere. We assume Rayleigh-like scattering (scaled by the maximum
polarisation, p_m at 90 degrees) and pressure insensitive extinction.
Atmospheres in which multiple scattering plays only a small role have an almost
linear relation between polarisation and A_G. In this case, the 4 sigma upper
limits is A_G<0.13(R/1.2 R_{Jup})^{-2}p_m^{-1} for 55 Cnc e. This suggests that
55 Cnc e is relatively small and not a pure H-He planet. The data do not give a
useful upper limit for 55 Cnc b. tau Boo is orbited by an unusually massive hot
Jupiter planet. The standard deviation in the night averaged Stokes Q/I and U/I
polarisation parameters is 5.1x10^{-6}. The 4 sigma upper limit is
A_G<0.37(R/1.2 R_{Jup})^{-2}p_m^{-1} for tau Boo b. This extends the similar
upper limits reported previously for this planet to longer wavelengths. The
larger scatter in the tau Boo data may be due to the spot activity detected
photometrically by the MOST satellite. These results contrast markedly with the
recent claim of a 3 sigma detection of a periodic polarisation signal from
HD189733 with amplitude P=2x10^{-4}, attributed to the planet HD189733 b.

half light radii and estimated masses of the bright knots are -12 - -13 mag,
200 - 300 pc and 10^6-7 Msolar, respectively. Long, narrow H-alpha emitting
filaments are connected at the south edge of the knots. The average color of

forming stars left along its trajectory. The most plausible fireball formation

Universe during the epoch of hydrogen and helium recombination with an
unprecedented combination of speed and accuracy. This is accomplished by
training the machine learning code Pico on the calculations of a multi-level
cosmological recombination code which self-consistently includes several
physical processes that were neglected previously. After training, Rico is used
to fit the free electron fraction as a function of the cosmological parameters.
While, for example at low redshifts (z<~900), much of the net change in the
ionization fraction can be captured by lowering the hydrogen fudge factor in
Recfast by about 3%, Rico provides a means of effectively using the accurate
ionization history of the full recombination code in the standard cosmological
parameter estimation framework without the need to add new or refined fudge
factors or functions to a simple recombination model. Within the new approach
presented here it is easy to update Rico whenever a more accurate full
recombination code becomes available. Once trained, Rico computes the
cosmological ionization history with negligible fitting error in ~10
milliseconds, a speed-up of at least 10^6 over the full recombination code that
was used here. Also Rico is able to reproduce the ionization history of the
full code to a level well below 0.1%, thereby ensuring that the theoretical
power spectra of CMB fluctuations can be computed to sufficient accuracy and
speed for analysis from upcoming CMB experiments like Planck. Furthermore it
will enable cross-checking different recombination codes across cosmological
parameter space, a comparison that will be very important in order to assure
the accurate interpretation of future cosmic microwave background data.

is somewhat flatter with m=1.88 \pm 0.40, a property also observed for galaxies

also strongly dependent on the spectral type of galaxies involved, late type
mergers being more frequent in the past, while early type mergers are more
frequent today, contributing to the rise in the local density of early type

no linear instability starts with a knowledge of exact coherent solutions,
among them travelling waves (TWs) and relative periodic orbits (RPOs). We
describe a numerical method to find such solutions in pipe flow and apply it in
the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation from a TW which looks to be especially
relevant for transition. The dominant structural feature of the RPO solution is
the presence of weakly modulated streaks. This RPO, like the TW from which it
bifurcates, sits on the laminar-turbulent boundary separating initial
conditions which lead to turbulence from those which immediately relaminarise.

the multiscaling associated to this dependence. In addition, our approach gives

resonances can be manipulated by changing the parameters of the control lasers.
By using the interference between these two resonances, we obtain an enhanced

  Lecture Notes 375, Cambridge University Press, 2010",,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most commonly known triangulated categories arise from chain complexes in
an abelian category by passing to chain homotopy classes or inverting
quasi-isomorphisms. Such examples are called `algebraic' because they originate
from abelian (or at least additive) categories. Stable homotopy theory produces
examples of triangulated categories by quite different means, and in this
context the source categories are usually very `non-additive' before passing to
homotopy classes of morphisms. Because of their origin I refer to these
examples as `topological triangulated categories'.
  In these extended talk notes I explain some systematic differences between
these two kinds of triangulated categories. There are certain properties --
defined entirely in terms of the triangulated structure -- which hold in all
algebraic examples, but which fail in some topological ones. These differences
are all torsion phenomena, and rationally there is no difference between
algebraic and topological triangulated categories.
