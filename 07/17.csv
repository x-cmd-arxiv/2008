spectroscopic sample of luminous red galaxies (LRG) from SDSS DR6 & DR7. We
find a strong (S/N$>$6) detection of $Q_3$ on scales of 55-125 Mpc/h, with a
well defined peak around 105 Mpc/h in all \xi_2, \xi_3 and Q_3, in excellent
agreement with the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO). We use very large simulations to asses and test
the significance of our measurement. Models without the BAO peak are ruled out
by the $Q_3$ data with 99% confidence. Our measurements show the expected shape
for Q_3 as a function of the triangular configuration. This provides a first
direct measurement of the non-linear mode coupling coefficients of density and
velocity fluctuations which, on these large scales, are independent of cosmic
time, the amplitude of fluctuations or cosmological parameters. The location of
the BAO peak in the data indicates \Omega_m =0.28 \pm 0.05 and \Omega_B=0.079
\pm 0.025 (h=0.70) after marginalization over spectral index (n_s=0.8-1.2)
linear b_1 and quadratic c_2 bias,which are found to be in the range:
b_1=1.7-2.2 and c_2=0.75-3.55. The data allows a hierarchical contribution from
primordial non-Gaussianities in the range Q_3=0.55-3.35. These constraints are
independent and complementary to the ones that can be obtained using the
2-point function, which are presented in a separate paper. This is the first
detection of the shape of $Q_3$ on BAO scales, but our errors are shot-noise
dominated and the SDSS volume is still relatively small, so there is ample room
for future improvement in this type of measurements.

the breaking from $\N=2$ super-QCD to $\N=1$ super-QCD. A mass term $W=\mu \Tr
\Phi^2 / 2$ for the adjoint field, which classically does the required breaking
perfectly, quantum mechanically leads to a relevant operator that, in the
infrared, makes the theory flow away from pure $\N=1$ SQCD. To avoid this
problem, we first need to extend the theory from $\SU (n_c)$ to $\U (n_c)$. We
then look for the quantum generalization of the condition $W^{\prime}(m)=0$,
that is, the coincidence between a root of the derivative of the superpotential
$W(\phi)$ and the mass $m$ of the quarks. There are $2n_c -n_f$ of such points
in the moduli space. We suggest that with an opportune choice of
superpotential, that selects one of these coincidence vacua in the moduli
space, it is possible to flow from $\N=2$ SQCD to $\N=1$ SQCD. Various
arguments support this claim. In particular, we shall determine the exact
location in the moduli space of these coincidence vacua and the precise
factorization of the SW curve.

separate line-of-sight and perpendicular directions, at small scales and in the
line-of-sight. We show that a simple Kaiser model for the anisotropic 2-point

peculiar velocities with an exponential form, can describe well the correlation
of LRG at all scales. We show that to describe with accuracy the so called
""fingers-of-God"" (FOG) elongations in the radial direction, it is necessary to
model the scale dependence of both bias $b$ and the pairwise rms peculiar
velocity $\sigma_{12}$ with the distance. We show how both quantities can be
inferred from the $\xisp$ data. From $r \simeq 10$ Mpc/h to $r \simeq 1$ Mpc/h,
both the bias and $\sigma_{12}$ are shown to increase by a factor of two: from
$b=2$ to $b=4$ and from $\sigma_{12}=400$ to 800 Km/s. The later is in good
agreement, within a 5 percent accuracy in the recovered velocities, with direct

independent renewal process, we obtain an i.i.d. sequence of words. In the
\emph{annealed} large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical process of
words, the rate function is the specific relative entropy of the observed law
of words w.r.t. the reference law of words. In the present paper we consider
the \emph{quenched} LDP, i.e., we condition on a typical letter sequence. We
focus on the case where the renewal process has an \emph{algebraic} tail. The
rate function turns out to be a sum of two terms, one being the annealed rate
function, the other being proportional to the specific relative entropy of the
observed law of letters w.r.t. the reference law of letters, with the former
being obtained by concatenating the words and randomising the location of the
origin. The proportionality constant equals the tail exponent of the renewal
process. Earlier work by Birkner considered the case where the renewal process
has an exponential tail, in which case the rate function turns out to be the
first term on the set where the second term vanishes and to be infinite
elsewhere.
  The previous version (arXiv:0807.2611v2) appeared in Probab. Theory Relat.
Fields 148, no. 3/4 (2010), 403--456. Meanwhile, it has turned out that the
original proof of the representation of the rate function is flawed when the
mean word length is infinite. We add an erratum in which we fix the flaw in the
proof. Along the way we derive new representations of the rate function that
are interesting in their own right. A key ingredient in the proof is the
observation that if the rate function in the annealed large deviation principle
is finite at a stationary word process, then the letters in the tail of the
long words in this process are typical.

structure calculations. The expansion employs a natural basis composed of a
selected reduced set of Bloch eigenfunctions. The reduced basis is selected
within the irreducible Brillouin zone at high symmetry points determined by the
medium's crystal structure and group theory (and possibly at additional related
points). At each of the reciprocal lattice selection points, a number of Bloch
eigenfunctions are selected up to the frequency range of interest for the band
structure calculations. Since it is common to initially discretize the periodic
unit cell and solution field using some choice of basis, reduced Bloch mode
expansion is practically a secondary expansion that uses a selected set of
Bloch eigenvectors. Such expansion therefore keeps, and builds on, any
favorable attributes a primary expansion approach might exhibit. Being in line
with the well known concept of modal analysis, the proposed approach maintains
accuracy while reducing the computation time by up to two orders of magnitudes
or more depending on the size and extent of the calculations. Results are
presented for phononic, photonic and electronic band structures.

produces a local density maximum that triggers the Rossby wave instability. The

possibility of gravitational collapse of the solids within the Rossby vortices.
We perform global simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a low mass
non-magnetized self-gravitating thin protoplanetary disk with the Pencil code.
We use multiple particle species of radius 1, 10, 30, and 100 cm. The dead zone
is modeled as a region of low viscosity. The Rossby vortices excited in the
edges of the dead zone are very efficient particle traps. Within 5 orbits after
their appearance, the solids achieve critical density and undergo gravitational
collapse into Mars sized objects. The velocity dispersions are of the order of
10 m/s for newly formed embryos, later lowering to less than 1 m/s by drag
force cooling. After 200 orbits, 38 gravitationally bound embryos were formed
inside the vortices, half of them being more massive than Mars. The embryos are
composed primarily of same-sized particles. We conclude that the presence of a
dead zone naturally gives rise to a population of protoplanetary cores in the

in quantum dots was discovered by three independent experimental groups.
Remarkably, these observations revealed three different mechanisms of EDSR:
coupling of electron spin to its momentum (spin-orbit), to the operator of its
position (inhomogeneous Zeeman coupling), and to the hyperfine Overhauser field
of nuclear spins. In this paper, I present a unified microscopic theory of
these resonances in quantum dots. A mean field theory, derived for all three
mechanisms and based on retaining only two-spin correlators, justifies applying
macroscopic description of nuclear polarization to the EDSR theory. In the
framework of the mean field theory, a fundamental difference in the time
dependence of EDSR inherent of these mechanisms is revealed; it changes from
the Rabi-type oscillations to a nearly monotonic growth. The theory provides a
regular procedure to account for the higher nuclear-spin correlators that
become of importance for a wider time span and can change the asymptotic
behavior of EDSR. It also allows revealing the effect of electron spin dynamics
on the effective coupling between nuclear spins.

perturbation parameter for a global transition to chaos. We perform several
surface of sections for the bidimensional case to derive an empirical value to

version of the coverage problem useful for surveillance applications, where the
objective is to position the robots in order to minimize the average distance
from a random point in a given environment to the closest robot. This problem
has been well-studied for omni-directional robots and it is shown that optimal
configuration for the network is a centroidal Voronoi configuration and that
the coverage cost belongs to $\Theta(m^{-1/2})$, where $m$ is the number of
robots in the network. In this paper, we study this problem for more realistic
models of robots, namely the double integrator (DI) model and the differential

in the algorithm design problem gives rise to an interesting behavior. For a
\emph{sparser} network, the optimal algorithm for these models of robots mimics
that for omni-directional robots. We propose novel algorithms whose
performances are within a constant factor of the optimal asymptotically (i.e.,
as $m \to +\infty$). In particular, we prove that the coverage cost for the DI

  Interstellar extinction in the inner regions of the galactic bulge amounts to
tens of magnitudes at visual wavelengths. As a consequence, the majority of
sources in that area are poorly studied and large numbers of potentially
interesting sources such as late-type giants with circumstellar shells, stellar
masers, infrared stars, remain excluded from the typical investigations which
are carried out in less problematic regions. Also undetected are a large
numbers of binaries. By observing LO events in this region, we gain the means
to investigate at least a selected number of sources with an unprecedented
combination of sensitivity and angular resolution. The LO technique permits to
achieve mas resolution with a sensitivity of K~12mag at a very large telescope.
We have used the opportunity of a favorable passage of the Moon over a crowded
region in the general direction of the Galactic Center to observe 78 LO events
of heavily reddened stellar sources. We have detected six new binary and one
triple star, with typical projected separation of ~0.01"". We have also detected
the compact circumstellar emission around one maser and one central star of a
planetary nebula. Additionally we have measured the diameter and/or
circumstellar shell of two carbon stars and other IR sources. In agreement with
our previous result, we conclude that lunar occultations in fast read-out mode

resolution close to 0.001"" with a sensitivity K~12mag.

equations through quadratic first-derivatives of the BI field. Such a
correction is equivalent to general relativity in the presence of a scalar
field with non-trivial kinetic energy. This stress-energy of this field is
automatically covariantly conserved by its own dynamical equations of motion,
thus satisfying the strong equivalence principle. Every general relativistic
solution remains a solution to the modified theory for any constant value of
the BI field. For arbitrary time-varying BI fields, a study of cosmological
solutions reduces the scalar field stress-energy to that of a pressureless
perfect fluid in a comoving reference frame, forcing the scale factor dynamics
to be equivalent to those of a stiff equation of state. Upon ultraviolet

which the Higgs can be lighter than the usually quoted current experimental
bound. The Higgs propagates in the bulk of a 5D space-time and Electroweak
Symmetry Breaking occurs by a combination of boundary conditions in the extra
dimension and an elementary Higgs. The Higgs can thus have a significantly
suppressed coupling to the other Standard Model fields. A large enough
suppression can be found to escape all limits and allow for a Higgs of any
mass, which would be associated with the discovery of W' and Z' Kaluza-Klein
resonances at the LHC. The Higgs can be precisely discovered at B-factories
while the LHC would be insensitive to it due to high backgrounds. In this
letter we study the Higgs discovery mode in Upsilon(3S), Upsilon(2S), and
Upsilon(1S) decays, and the model parameter space that will be probed by BaBar,
Belle, and CLEO data. In the absence of an early discovery of a heavy Higgs at
the LHC, A Super-B factory would be an excellent option to further probe this

evolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution

speciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this
question we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness
differences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics
drive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest
speed of speciation, species richness (i.e. five times and twice as many
species as compared to genetic and ecological graphs, respectively) and
genetic--species diversity (i.e., twice as many as genetic and ecological
graphs, respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic--species
diversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic
factors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system. By linking
molecular, sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales,
interacting graphs can illuminate the origin and evolution of diversity and
organismal coexistence.

bonding in transition metals. When applying pure shear stress in the slip
direction it displays significant twinning-antitwinning asymmetry for
molybdenum but not for tungsten. However, for tensile/compressive loading the
Schmid law breaks down in both metals, principally due to the effect of shear
stresses perpendicular to the slip direction that alter the dislocation core.
Recognition of this phenomenon forms a basis for the development of physically
based yield criteria that capture the breakdown of the Schmid law in BCC
metals. Moreover, dislocation glide may be preferred on {110} planes other than
the most highly stressed one, which is reminiscent of the anomalous slip
observed in many BCC metals.

  Aims: The aim of this paper is to obtain information of the surface
properties of two members of this group ((24835) 1995 SM55, (120178) 2003 OP32)
and three potential members (2003 UZ117, (120347) 2004 SB60 and 2005 UQ513) and
to use that in order to confirm or reject their association.
  Methods: We obtained visible spectra of five TNOs using the 3.58m Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo at the ''Roque de los Muchachos Observatory'' (La Palma,
Spain)
  Results: The spectra of the five TNOs are featureless within the
uncertainties and with colors from slightly blue to red (-2<
S'<18%/0.1microns). No signatures of any absorption are found.
  Conclusions: We confirm the association of 1995 SM55 and 2003 OP32 with the
group of 2003 EL61 as their spectra are almost identical to that of 2003 EL61.
Only one of the three candidates, 2003 UZ117, can be considered as a possible
member of the EL61-group, as its visible spectrum is compatible with a spectrum
of a surface composed of almost pure water ice and no complex organics. The
other two, 2004 SB60 and 2005 UQ513 are red and must be considered as
interlopers.

it is possible for the interstitial vortices to form dimer or higher n-mer
states which have an additional orientational degree of freedom that can lead
to the formation of vortex molecular crystals. For filling fractions where
dimer states appear, a novel dynamical symmetry breaking can occur when the
dimers flow in one of two possible alignment directions. This leads to
transport in the direction transverse to the applied drive. We show that
dimerization produces distinct types of moving phases which depend on the
direction of the driving force with respect to the pinning lattice symmetry.
When the dimers are driven along certain directions, a reorientation of the
dimers can produce a jamming phenomenon which results in a strong enhancement
in the critical depinning force. The jamming can also cause unusual effects
such as an increase in the critical depinning force when the size of the
pinning sites is reduced.

X(3872) is described using an effective theory of nonrelativistic D mesons and
pions (X-EFT). We calculate X(3872) decays by first matching heavy hadron
chiral perturbation theory (HHchiPT) amplitudes for D^0 bar{D}^{*0} -> chi_{cJ}

theorems for X(3872) decays to conventional quarkonia previously derived using
the operator product expansion. For single pion decays, we find nontrivial
dependence on the pion energy from HHchiPT diagrams with virtual D mesons. This
nontrivial energy dependence can potentially modify heavy quark symmetry

final states with two pions are dominated by the final state chi_{c1} + pi^0 +

radio systems as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). A group
of cognitive users cooperatively tries to exploit vacancies in primary
(licensed) channels whose occupancies follow a Markovian evolution. We first
consider the scenario where the cognitive users have perfect knowledge of the
distribution of the signals they receive from the primary users. For this
problem, we obtain a greedy channel selection and access policy that maximizes
the instantaneous reward, while satisfying a constraint on the probability of
interfering with licensed transmissions. We also derive an analytical universal
upper bound on the performance of the optimal policy. Through simulation, we
show that our scheme achieves good performance relative to the upper bound and
improved performance relative to an existing scheme.
  We then consider the more practical scenario where the exact distribution of
the signal from the primary is unknown. We assume a parametric model for the
distribution and develop an algorithm that can learn the true distribution,
still guaranteeing the constraint on the interference probability. We show that
this algorithm outperforms the naive design that assumes a worst case value for
the parameter. We also provide a proof for the convergence of the learning
algorithm.

consider online scheduling of packets with hard deadlines in a finite capacity

Packets arrive over time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value
and an integer deadline. In each time step, only one packet is allowed to be
sent. Our objective is to maximize the total value gained by the packets sent
by their deadlines in an online manner. Due to the Internet traffic's chaotic
characteristics, no stochastic assumptions are made on the packet input
sequences. This model is called a {\em finite-queue model}.
  We use competitive analysis to measure an online algorithm's performance
versus an unrealizable optimal offline algorithm who constructs the worst
possible input based on the knowledge of the online algorithm. For the
finite-queue model, we first present a deterministic 3-competitive memoryless
online algorithm. Then, we give a randomized ($\phi^2 = ((1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2)^2
\approx 2.618$)-competitive memoryless online algorithm.
  The algorithmic framework and its theoretical analysis include several
interesting features. First, our algorithms use (possibly) modified
characteristics of packets; these characteristics may not be same as those
specified in the input sequence. Second, our analysis method is different from
the classical potential function approach.

event began. We examine the evolution of the AR-CH complex during 5-6 May 1999
to study the changes that apparently played a key role in causing this
disappearance event. Aims. To study the evolution of the solar source region of
the disappearance event of 11 May 1999. Methods. Using images from the Soft
X-ray Telescope (SXT), the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) and the
Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) to examine the evolution of the CH and AR
complex at the source region of the disappearance event. Results. We find a
dynamic evolution taking place in the CH-AR boundary at the source region of
the disappearance event of 11 May 1999. This evolution, which is found to
reduce the area of the CH, is accompanied by the formation of new loops in EUV
images that are spatially and temporally correlated with emerging flux regions
as seen in MDI data. Conclusions. In the period leading up to the disappearance
event of 11 May 1999, our observations, during quiet solar conditions and in
the absence of CMEs, provide the first clear evidence for Sun-Earth connection
originating from an evolving AR-CH region located at central meridian. With the
exception of corotating interacting regions (CIR), these observations provide
the first link between the Sun and space weather effects at 1 AU, arising from

$Q_g$, the maximal tangential perturbation associated with the bar, normalized

are obtained using near-infrared images of the galaxies. However, $Q_g$ is
sensitive to bulge mass. Hence we also estimated bar strengths from the
relative Fourier intensity amplitude ($A_{2}$) of bars in near-infrared images.
The central velocity dispersions were obtained from integral field spectroscopy
observations of the velocity fields in the centers of these galaxies; it was
normalized by the rotation curve amplitude obtained from HI line width for each

that bars weaken as their central components become kinematically hotter. This

functions of pion-Compton scattering from a study of the
small-momentum-transfer region where the bremsstrahlung reaction is dominated
by the single-photon-exchange mechanism. The corresponding cross-section
distribution is characterized by a sharp peak at small momentum transfers. But
there is also a hadronic contribution which is smooth and constitutes an
undesired background. In this communication the modification of the
single-photon exchange amplitude by multiple-Coulomb scattering is investigated
as well as the Coulomb-nuclear interference term.

  We construct a sequence of spherical latin trades which cannot be embedded in

duality where the streams of every single user are not treated as
self-interference as in the hitherto existing stream-wise rate dualities for
linear filtering, we solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem of the
broadcast channel in the dual multiple access channel. Thus, we can exactly
quantify the asymptotic rate loss of linear filtering compared to dirty paper

matrices to the broadcast channel by means of the duality, we observe that the
optimal covariance matrices in the broadcast channel feature quite complicated
but still closed form expressions although the respective transmit covariance
matrices in the dual multiple access channel share a very simple structure. We
immediately come to the conclusion that block-diagonalization is the
asymptotically optimum transmit strategy in the broadcast channel. Out of the

largest sum rate and thus corresponds to the optimum solution found in the dual

different spectral states have been identified from the hard Color-Intensity

We show that in an SMP protocol that computes some function with the first
party sending q qubits and the second sending c classical bits, the quantum
message can be replaced by a randomized message of O(qc) classical bits, as
well as by a deterministic message of O(q c log q) classical bits. Our proofs
rely heavily on earlier results due to Scott Aaronson.
  In particular, our results imply that quantum-classical protocols need to
send Omega(sqrt{n/log n}) bits/qubits to compute Equality on n-bit strings, and
hence are not significantly better than classical-classical protocols (and are
much worse than quantum-quantum protocols such as quantum fingerprinting). This
essentially answers a recent question of Wim van Dam. Our results also imply,
more generally, that there are no superpolynomial separations between
quantum-classical and classical-classical SMP protocols for functional
problems. This contrasts with the situation for relational problems, where
exponential gaps between quantum-classical and classical-classical SMP
protocols are known. We show that this surprising situation cannot arise in
purely classical models: there, an exponential separation for a relational
problem can be converted into an exponential separation for a functional
problem.

BCG which has a blue rest-frame UV colour also shows a blue-core in its optical
colour profile. Conversely, BCGs that lack blue cores and show monotonic colour
gradients typical of old elliptical galaxies, are red in the UV. We interpret
this as evidence that the NUV enhancement in the blue BCGs is driven by recent
star formation and not from old evolved stellar populations such as horizontal
branch stars. The recent star formation in the blue BCGs typically has an age
less than 200 Myrs and contributes mass fractions of less than a percent.
Although the sample studied here is small, we demonstrate, for the first time,
a one-to-one correspondence between blue cores in elliptical galaxies (in
particular BCGs) and a NUV-enhancement observed using GALEX. The combination of
this one-to-one correspondence and the consistently young age of recent star
formation, coupled with additional correlations with the host cluster's X-ray
properties, strongly suggests that the star formation is fueled by gas cooling
out of the intracluster medium. In turn, this implies that any AGN heating of
the intracluster medium in massive clusters only acts to reduce the magnitude
of the cooling flow and that once this flow starts, it is nearly always active.

dislodges the second by electron-impact ionization. Employing modified
saddle-point equations, we single out the contributions of different scattering
scenarios to the maxima and minima observed in the differential electron
momentum distributions. We show that the quantum interference between the
electron orbits starting and ending at a specific center $C_{j}$%, and those
starting at $C_{j}$ and ending at a different center $C_{\nu}$ leads to the
same maxima as minima as if all possible scenarios are taken. There exist,
however, quantitative differences as far as the gauge choice is concerned.
Indeed, while the velocity-gauge distributions obtained employing only the
above-mentioned processes are practically identical to the overall
distributions, their length-gauge counterparts exhibit an asymmetry in the
positive and negative momentum regions. This asymmetry is due to additional
potential-energy shifts which are only present in the length-gauge formulation,
and which, depending on the center, sink or increase the potential barrier
through which the first electron tunnels. In contrast, the interference between
topologically similar scenarios leads at most to patterns whose positions, in
momentum space, do not agree with the overall interference condition, neither

the properties of the Hipparcos catalogue into account. The biases involved in
applying certain selections are estimated with this model.
  The absolute magnitudes that are found are $M_{\rm I} = -0.22 \pm 0.03$ and
$M_{\rm K} = -1.54 \pm 0.04$ (on the 2MASS system). The $I$-band value is in
good agreement with previous determinations, the $K$-band value is fainter than
previously quoted, and this seems to be related to a selection bias whereby
accurate $K$-magnitudes are only available for relatively few bright stars.
Applying population corrections to the absolute $K$ magnitude of RC stars in
clusters supports the fainter magnitude scale.

used to analyse different types of dependence, in particular for spatially
correlated data. However, when those models are faced with the challenge of
selecting a dependence structure from many, the use of standard model choice
methods is hampered by the unavailability of the normalising constant in the
Gibbs likelihood. In particular, from a Bayesian perspective, the computation
of the posterior probabilities of the models under competition requires special
likelihood-free simulation techniques like the Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) algorithm that is intensively used in population genetics. We show in
this paper how to implement an ABC algorithm geared towards model choice in the
general setting of Gibbs random fields, demonstrating in particular that there
exists a sufficient statistic across models. The accuracy of the approximation
to the posterior probabilities can be further improved by importance sampling
on the distribution of the models. The practical aspects of the method are
detailed through two applications, the test of an iid Bernoulli model versus a
first-order Markov chain, and the choice of a folding structure for two
proteins.

truncations (Type II galaxies) or antitruncations (Type III galaxies). The
color profiles of Type II galaxies show a ""U shape"" with a minimum of (g' - r')

galaxies have a plateau region with a color of (g' - r') = 0.57 +- 0.02. Using
the color to calculate the stellar surface mass density profiles reveals a
surprising result. The breaks, well established in the light profiles of the
truncated galaxies, are almost gone, and the mass profiles resemble now those
of the pure exponential (Type I) galaxies. This result suggests that the origin
of the break in Type II galaxies is more likely due to a radial change in
stellar population than being associated to an actual drop in the distribution
of mass. Type III galaxies, however, seem to preserve their shape in the
stellar mass density profiles. We find that the stellar surface mass density at
the break for truncated galaxies is 13.6 +- 1.6 Msun pc^-2 and for the
antitruncated ones is 9.9 +- 1.3 Msun pc^-2 . We estimate that the fraction of

the subhaloes even for events which took place up to eight Gyrs ago, $z \sim
1$. This phenomenon appears to be rather common since at least 1/3 of the
present-day subhaloes have fallen in groups in our simulations. Hence, this may
well explain the Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell ghostly streams. We have also found
that the probability of building up a flattened distribution similar to the MW
satellites is as high as $\sim 80%$ if the MW satellites were from only one
group and $\sim 20%$ when five groups are involved. Therefore, we conclude that
the `peculiar' distribution of satellites around the MW can be expected with

of bare surfaces and in the presence of an oxygen ad-layer has been studied by
means of first-principles modeling based on density-functional theory (DFT).
For both systems, change of the d-band filling due to charge transfer between
the alloy components, resulting in a shift of the d-band center of surface
atoms compared to the pure components, drives the surface segregation and
governs the chemical reactivity of the bimetals. In contrast to previous
findings but consistent with analogous PtNi alloy systems, enrichment of Pt
atoms in the surface layer and of Pd atoms in the first subsurface layer has
been found in Pt-rich PtPd alloy, despite the lower surface energy of pure Pd
compared to pure Pt. Similarly, Co surface and Cr subsurface segregation occurs
in Co-rich CoCr alloys. However, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Pd and Cr
occupy preferentially surface sites due to their lower electronegativity and
thus stronger oxygen affinity compared to Pt and Co, respectively. In either
cases, the calculated oxygen adsorption energies on the alloy surfaces are
larger than on the pure components when the more noble components are present
in the subsurface layers.

classified by the way ground state wave functions go to zero when electrons are

similar way, by the pattern of zeros that result when electrons are brought
close to the quasiparticles. In this paper we combine the pattern-of-zero
approach and the conformal-field-theory (CFT) approach to calculate the
topological properties of quasiparticles. We discuss how the quasiparticles in
FQH states naturally form representations of a magnetic translation algebra,
with members of a representation differing from each other by Abelian
quasiparticles. We find that this structure dramatically simplifies topological
properties of the quasiparticles, such as their fusion rules, charges, and
scaling dimensions, and has consequences for the ground state degeneracy of FQH
states on higher genus surfaces. We find constraints on the pattern of zeros of
quasiparticles that can fuse together, which allow us to obtain the fusion
rules of quasiparticles from their pattern of zeros, at least in the case of
the (generalized and composite) parafermion states. We also calculate from CFT
the number of quasiparticle types in the generalized and composite parafermion
states, which confirm the result obtained previously through a completely
different approach.

differentiation. These are described by concepts such as emerging states with
specific symmetries that are linked to order parameters. In quantum Hall phases
of electrons in semiconductor double layers with large inter-layer electron
correlation there is an emergent many body exciton phase with an order
parameter that measures the condensate fraction of excitons across the
tunneling gap. As the inter-layer coupling is reduced by application of an
in-plane magnetic field, this excitonic insulating state is brought in
competition with a Fermi-metal phase of composite fermions (loosely, electrons
with two magnetic flux quanta attached) stabilized by intra-layer electron
correlation. Here we show that the quantum phase transformation between
metallic and excitonic insulating states in the coupled bilayers becomes
discontinuous (first-order) by impacts of different terms of the
electron-electron interactions that prevail on weak residual disorder. The
evidence is based on precise determinations of the excitonic order parameter by
inelastic light scattering measurements close to the phase boundary. While
there is marked softening of low-lying excitations, our experiments underpin
the roles of competing orders linked to quasi-particle correlations in removing

discretizing the equations of motion. The resulting discrete theories are known
to be problematic since the first class algebra of constraints of the continuum
theory becomes second class upon discretization. If one treats the second class
constraints properly, the resulting theories have very different dynamics and
number of degrees of freedom than those of the continuum theory. It is
therefore questionable how these theories could be considered a starting point
for quantization and the definition of a continuum theory through a continuum
limit. We show explicitly in a model that the {\em uniform discretizations}
approach to the quantization of constrained systems overcomes these
difficulties. We consider here a simple diffeomorphism invariant one
dimensional model and complete the quantization using {\em uniform
discretizations}. The model can be viewed as a spherically symmetric reduction
of the well known Husain--Kucha\v{r} model of diffeomorphism invariant theory.
We show that the correct quantum continuum limit can be satisfactorily

property that each element of the Banach space attains its norm on an element
of that subset. Trivially, the pointwise convergence with respect to such a
boundary is coarser than the weak topology on the Banach space. Godefroy's
Boundary Problem asks whether nevertheless both topologies have the same
bounded compact sets. This paper contains the answer in the positive.

graph process which continuously combines the {\it classical} model and the BA
model. Note that the number of step added edges for the mixed model is random
and non-uniformly bounded. By developing a comparing argument, phase transition
on the degree distributions of the mixed model is revealed: while the {\it
pure} classical model possesses a {\it exponential} degree sequence, the {\it
pure} BA model and the mixed model possess {\it power law} degree sequences. As
an application of the methodology, phase transition on the degree sequence of
{\it another} mixed model with {\it hard copying} is also studied, especially,
in the power law region, the inverse power can take any value greater than 1.

we have studied a point defect in an epitaxial graphene sample grown on silicon
carbide substrate. This analysis allows us to extract the quasiparticle energy
dispersion, and to give a first experimental proof of the validity of Fermi
liquid theory in graphene for a wide range of energies from -800 meV to +800
meV. We also find evidence of a strong threefold anisotropy in the standing
waves generated by the defect. We discuss possible relations between this
anisotropy, the chirality of the electrons, and the asymmetry between
graphene's two sublattices. All experimental measurements are compared and
related to theoretical T-matrix calculations.

unconventional physics when they are lightly doped whereas the standard theory
of metals prevails in the opposite regime. For example, the thermoelectric
power, that is the voltage that develops across a sample in response to a
temperature gradient, changes sign abruptly near optimal doping in a wide class
of cuprates, a stark departure from the standard theory of metals in which the
thermopower vanishes only when one electron exists per site. We show that this
effect arises from proximity to a state in which particle-hole symmetry is
dynamically generated. The operative mechanism is dynamical spectral weight
transfer from states that lie at least 2eV away from the chemical potential. We
show that the sign change is reproduced quantitatively within the Hubbard model
for moderate values of the on-site repulsion, $U$. For sufficiently large
values of on-site repulsion, for example, $U=20t$, ($t$ the hopping matrix
element), dynamical spectral weight transfer attenuates and our calculated
results for the thermopower are in prefect agreement with exact atomic limit.
The emergent particle-hole symmetry close to optimal doping points to pairing
in the cuprates being driven by high-energy electronic states.
