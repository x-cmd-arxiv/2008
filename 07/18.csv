density cusp around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei. We
follow the evolution of a multi-mass system of BHs and stars by numerically
integrating the Fokker-Planck energy diffusion equations for a variety of BH
mass distributions. We find that the BHs ""self-segregate'', and that the
rarest, most massive BHs dominate the scattering rate closest to the SMBH (<
0.1 pc). BH--BH binaries form out of gravitational wave emission during BH
encounters. We find that the expected rate of BH coalescence events detectable
by Advanced LIGO is ~1 - 100/yr, depending on the initial mass function of
stars in galactic nuclei and the mass of the most massive BHs. We find that the
actual merger rate is likely ~10 times larger than this due to the intrinsic
scatter of stellar densities in many different galaxies. The BH binaries that
form this way in galactic nuclei have significant eccentricities as they enter
the LIGO band (90% with e > 0.9), and are therefore distinguishable from other
binaries, which circularise before becoming detectable. We also show that
eccentric mergers can be detected to larger distances and greater BH masses
than circular mergers, up to ~ 700 solar masses. Future ground-based
gravitational wave observatories will be able to constrain both the mass
function of BHs and stars in galactic nuclei.

planetary migration inside the protoplanetary disc : an inwards migrating outer

of the resonant pair of planets, the eccentricities are expected to rise
excessively, if no damping mechanism is applied on the inner planet. We express
the required damping action to match the observations, and we show that the

a computation of the relative volumes of phase space characterized by large-

measured by mean chaotic diffusion rate. We find that Neptune's 2:1 resonance
has weaker overall long-term stability than the 3:2 -- only ~15% of Twotinos
are projected to survive for 4 Gyr, compared to ~27% of Plutinos, based on an
extrapolation from our 1-Gyr integrations. We find that Pluto has only a modest
effect, causing a ~4% decrease in the Plutino population that survives to 4
Gyr. Given current observational estimates, and assuming an initial
distribution of particles proportional to the local phase space volume in the
resonance, we conclude that the primordial populations of Plutinos and Twotinos
formerly made up more than half the population of the classical and resonant
Kuiper Belt. We also conclude that Twotinos were originally nearly as numerous
as Plutinos; this is consistent with predictions from early models of smooth
giant planet migration and resonance sweeping of the Kuiper Belt, and provides
a useful constraint for more detailed models.

characteristics of the latter group, an abstract group of order d**3 noted P_d,

equivalently Lie algebra of dimension d**3 associated with P_d). Leaving the
abstract sector, a set of Weyl pairs in dimension d is derived from a polar
decomposition of SU(2) closely connected to angular momentum theory. Then, a
realization of the generalized Pauli group P_d and the construction of
generalized Pauli matrices in dimension d are revisited in terms of Weyl pairs.
Finally, the Lie algebra of the unitary group U(d) is obtained as a subalgebra
of the Lie algebra associated with P_d. This leads to a development of the Lie
algebra of U(d) in a basis consisting of d**2 generalized Pauli matrices. In
the case where d is a power of a prime integer, the Lie algebra of SU(d) can be

luminescence. The tilted spin polarization of free electrons is induced under
interband absorption of circularly polarized light, and the paramagnetic
centers acquire spin polarization because of spin-dependent capture of free
spin-polarized electrons by these centers. The measured Hanle curve is a
superposition of two lines, narrow and broad, with the widths ~400 G and ~50000
G, arising due to the depolarization of localized and free electrons,
respectively. The magnitude and direction of the asymmetry in the measured

photoluminecsence from the heavy- and light-hole subbands split by a uniaxial
deformation of the GaAs{1-x}N{x} film grown on a GaAs substrate. We have

occurring in a variety of different quantum and classical systems, including
condensed-matter, Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, quantum
chaotic systems, sound waves and light. A localization phase transition is
expected to occur in three dimensional disordered systems as the strength of
disorder crosses a critical value. Recently, a crossover from an extended to a
localized phase has been observed in low-dimensional photonic lattices and
Bose-Einstein condensates. Other experiments studied the critical behaviour
near the transition in three dimensions via transmission measurements. However,
no direct observation of a localization transition for light has been reported.
In 1979 Aubry and Andre predicted that for a certain class of quasi-periodic
potentials, a localization phase transition can occur already in one-dimension.
This strongly correlated potential is markedly different from the disordered
case were the potential is uncorrelated. Here we report an experiment that
realizes the Aubry-Andre model in quasi-periodic photonic lattices. We observe
the signature of a localization phase transition by directly measuring the
expansion rates of initially narrow wave packets propagating in the lattice.
Below the transition point, all the modes of the system are extended and
therefore an initially narrow wave-packet eventually spreads across the entire
lattice. Above the critical point, all modes are localized and expansion is
suppressed. In addition, we study the effect of weak nonlinear interactions on
light propagation below and above the transition.

coupled to a local nonrelativistic particle density. We derive general results
in this model for the rates of density matrix diagonalization and of state
vector reduction, and show that (in the absence of decoherence) both processes

reducing the octahedral distortion. The appearance of a feature in the lattice

critical for inferring their formation and evolution. The internal density
distribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through
the gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges.
These quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the
planetary Love number ($k_{2p}$, twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk
physical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density
distribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We
find that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of
apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters ($a \lesssim 0.025$ AU), exceeding the
effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order
of magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces
precession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric
signal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much
more important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of
ultra-precise photometry, the space-based \emph{Kepler} mission can
realistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer
the presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital
eccentricities as low as $e \simeq 0.003$. The signal due to $k_{2p}$ creates
unique transit light curve variations that are generally not degenerate with
other parameters or phenomena. We discuss the plausibility of measuring
$k_{2p}$ in an effort to directly constrain the interior properties of
extra-solar planets.

in coronal spectral lines formed at typical quiet Sun and active region
temperatures. The outflows are positively correlated with non-thermal
velocities in coronal plasmas. The bulk mass motions and non-thermal velocities
are derived from spectral line centroids and line widths, mostly from a strong
line of Fe XII at 195.12 Angstroms. The electron temperature of the outflow

1.2-1.4 MK. The electron density of the outflow regions derived from a density

ratio of mass to magnetic flux, M/Phi, between the cloud core and envelope.
This relative M/Phi measurement reduces uncertainties in previous studies, such
as the angle between B and the line of sight and the value of [OH/H]. Our
result is that for all four clouds, the ratios R of the core to the envelope
values of M/Phi are less than 1. Stated another way, the ratios R' of the core
to the total cloud M/Phi are less than 1. The extreme case or idealized (no

the central to total M/Phi to be approximately equal to the inverse of the
original subcritical M/Phi, or R' > 1. The probability that all four of our

contradiction with the hypothesis that these four cores were formed by
ambipolar diffuson. Highly super-Alfvenic turbulent simulations yield a wide

is limited to four clouds, and we can only directly test the predictions of the

generically permits two distinct vacuum solutions. One solution (the ""Einstein""
vacuum) has a well defined limit as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling goes to zero,
whereas the other solution (the ""stringy"" vacuum) does not. There has been some
debate regarding the stability of these vacua, most recently from Deser and
Tekin who have argued that the corresponding black hole solutions have positive
mass and as such both vacua are stable. Whilst the statement about the mass is
correct, we argue that the stringy vacuum is still perturbatively unstable.
Simply put, the stringy vacuum suffers from a ghost-like instability that is
not excited by the spherically symmetric black hole, but would be excited by
any source likely to emit gravitational waves, such as a binary system. This
result is reliable except in the strongly coupled regime close to the
Chern-Simons limit, when the two vacua are almost degenerate. In this regime,
we study instanton transitions between branches via bubble nucleation, and
calculate the nucleation probability. This demonstrates that there is large
mixing between the vacua, so that neither of them can accurately describe the
true quantum vacuum. We also present a new gravitational instanton describing
black hole pair production in de Sitter space on the Einstein branch, which is
preferred to the usual Nariai instantons, and is not present in pure Einstein
gravity.

hybridization of two counter--propagating edge states of opposing spin due to
interactions. The resulting non--chiral edge mode is a Luttinger liquid of
parameter K, which enters a gapped, perfectly conducting state below a critical
value K_c\approx 1/2. Backscattering in this system involves spin flip, so that
interaction with localized magnetic moments generates a finite resistivity
R_{xx} via a ""chiral Kondo effect"". At finite temperatures T, R_{xx}(T)
exhibits a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior as K is tuned across
a threshold K_{MI}. For T->0, R_{xx} in the intermediate regime K_{MI}<K<K_c is
finite, but diverges as K approaches K_c. This model provides a natural
interpretation of recent experiments.

relations. We consider spheroid sizes, velocity dispersions, masses, profile
shapes (Sersic indices), and black hole (BH) masses, and their related
scalings. Our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halo
occupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. This allows us to
separate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, and
progenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.
Dissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes and
fundamental plane (FP) scalings, and can account for the FP tilt and
differences between disk and spheroid scalings. Because disks at high-z have
higher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compact
spheroids. This predicts mass-dependent evolution in spheroid sizes, in
agreement with observations. This relates to subtle evolution in the FP,
important to studies that assume a fixed intrinsic FP. This also predicts mild
evolution in BH-host correlations, towards larger BHs at higher z. Dry mergers
are significant, but only for massive systems which form early: they form
compact, but undergo dry mergers (consistent with observations) such that their
sizes at later times are similar to spheroids of similar mass formed more
recently. We model descendants of observed compact high-z spheroids: most will
become cores of BCGs, with sizes, velocity dispersions, and BH masses
consistent with observations, but we identify a fraction that might survive to
z=0 intact.

complements the distance histogram by taking into account the nodes lying

electromagnetic field is typically very weak. By employing a cavity to confine
the field, the strength of this interaction can be increased many orders of
magnitude to a point where it dominates over any dissipative process. This
strong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics has been reached for
real atoms in optical cavities, and for artificial atoms in circuit QED and
quantum-dot systems. A signature of strong coupling is the splitting of the
cavity transmission peak into a pair of resolvable peaks when a single resonant
atom is placed inside the cavity - an effect known as vacuum Rabi splitting.
The circuit QED architecture is ideally suited for going beyond this linear
response effect. Here, we show that increasing the drive power results in two
unique nonlinear features in the transmitted heterodyne signal: the
supersplitting of each vacuum Rabi peak into a doublet, and the appearance of
additional peaks with the characteristic sqrt(n) spacing of the Jaynes-Cummings
ladder. These constitute direct evidence for the coupling between the quantized
microwave field and the anharmonic spectrum of a superconducting qubit acting

three-dimensional magnetic configurations is proposed. The method is based on
the field-line mapping technique previously used only for the analysis of
magnetic structure at a given time. This technique is extended here so as to
analyze the evolution of magnetic structure. Such a generalization is made with
the help of new dimensionless quantities called ""slip-squashing factors"". Their
large values define the surfaces that border the reconnected or
to-be-reconnected magnetic flux tubes for a given period of time during the
magnetic evolution. The proposed method is universal, since it assumes only
that the time sequence of evolving magnetic field and the tangential boundary
flows are known. The application of the method is illustrated for simple
examples, one of which was considered previously by Hesse and coworkers in the
framework of the general magnetic reconnection theory. The examples help us to
compare these two approaches; they reveal also that, just as for magnetic null
points, hyperbolic and cusp minimum points of a magnetic field may serve as
favorable sites for magnetic reconnection. The new method admits a
straightforward numerical implementation and provides a powerful tool for the
diagnostics of magnetic reconnection in numerical models of solar-flare-like
phenomena in space and laboratory plasmas.

velocity water maser jets. They are the best objects to study the onset of
bipolar jets from evolved stars due to their young dynamical ages. [Methods] We
use the Arizona Radio Observatory 10m telescope to observe the CO J=2-1 line
and compare the line parameters with that of masers. [Results] We report the
detection of 12CO and 13COJ=2-1 lines from IRAS 16342-3814. The inferred 12CO
mass loss rate is an order of magnitude lower than the infrared and OH mass
loss rates, indicating a very cold and thick O-rich circumstellar envelope
around the star. We also find a 12CO expansion velocity of Vexp = 46 +- 1 km/s
that is too high for an AGB wind and confirm the systemic velocity of 44 +- 1
km/s. In addition we measure a very low 12CO/13CO line ratio of 1.7.
[Conclusions] The first detection of CO lines has provided a new way to
investigate the water fountain stars. Given the high expansion velocity of the
CO gas and its relation to maser velocities, we infer that the CO emission
region is co-located with the OH mainline masers in the warm base of the
optical bipolar lobes, while the high velocity OH1612MHz and H2O masers are
located in the side walls and at the farthest ends of the bipolar lobes,
respectively. Further observations are highly desired to understand the very
low 12CO/13CO line ratio.

classically chaotic quantum motion. We analyze the connection between
reversibility and the rate at which a quantum state acquires a more and more
complicated structure in its time evolution. This complexity is characterized
by the number ${\cal M}(t)$ of harmonics of the (initially isotropic, i.e.
${\cal M}(0)=0$) Wigner function, which are generated during quantum evolution
for the time $t$. We show that, in contrast to the classical exponential
increase, this number can grow not faster than linearly and then relate this
fact with the degree of reversibility of the quantum motion. To explore the
reversibility we reverse the quantum evolution at some moment $T$ immediately
after applying at this moment an instant perturbation governed by a strength
parameter $\xi$. It follows that there exists a critical perturbation strength,
$\xi_c\approx \sqrt{2}/{\cal M}(T)$, below which the initial state is well
recovered, whereas reversibility disappears when $\xi\gtrsim \xi_c(T)$. In the
classical limit the number of harmonics proliferates exponentially with time
and the motion becomes practically irreversible. The above results are
illustrated in the example of the kicked quartic oscillator model.

experimental results indicate insulating behavior. It was described that the
metal-insulator transition (MIT) at x = 0.5 observed in this system appears due
to the enhancement of on-site Coulomb repulsion strength, U with Ti
substitutions, x. The MIT primarily depends on U and partially on x and/or
disorder. All these conclusions are in sharp contrast to the experimental
observations, which predicted Anderson insulating phase at x = 0.5 (finite
localized density of states at the Fermi level). The hard gap due to electron
correlation appears at much higher x (~ 0.8). In addition, it is well
established that homovalent substitution has negligible influence on on-site
$U$ (a local variable). These inconsistencies appear due to the fact that the
calculated results representing the bulk electronic structure are compared with
the experimental results dominated by surface contributions. The experimental
bulk spectra, already available in the literature exhibit finite density of
states at the Fermi level even for x >= 0.5 sample, which suggests that the
conclusion of half metallic phase in an earlier study is reasonable. Thus, the
insulator to metal transition in these systems is driven by bandwidth, W rather
than U and disorder plays dominant role in the metal-insulator transition. One
needs to consider the bulk spectra to reproduce numerically the bulk electronic

obtain constraints on cosmological parameters including dynamical dark energy
parametrized by $P/\rho\equiv w(z) = w_0 + w_a \cdot z/(1+z)$. It is found that
the current GRB data are consistent with the concordance model, ($\Omega_m =
0.28, \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.72, w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$), within two sigma level.
Although constraints from GRBs themselves are not so strong, they can improve
the conventional constraints from SNeIa because GRBs have much higher
redshifts. Further we estimate the constraints on the dark-energy parameters
expected by future observations with GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space
Telescope) and \swift by Monte-Carlo simulation. Constraints would improve
substantially with another 150 GRBs.

The resulting relativistically covariant equation of motion is expressed in

radiation energy and mass of the particle. The role of the diffraction nicely
fits the relativistic formulation of the momentum of the outgoing radiation.
  The inequality 0 < $\bar{Q}'_{pr, 1} / \bar{Q}'_{ext}$ < 2 is a simple
relativistic consequence for the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) effect
($\bar{Q}'_{ext}$ and $\bar{Q}'_{pr, 1}$ are dimensionless efficiency factors

a dust temperature of $T\rm_d$=26-36 K and a dust mass of M$\rm

splitting of 3 cm-1 as a result of spin-phonon coupling, the other three
optical eigenmodes only show shifts of the eigenfrequencies. The
antiferromagnetic ordering and the concomitant splitting of the phonon mode can
be suppressed in a magnetic field of 7 T. At higher energies we observed a
broad excitation band which is dominated by a two-peak-structure at about
18,000 cm-1 and 22,000 cm-1, respectively. These energies are in good agreement
with the expected spin-allowed crystal-field transition of the Cr3+ ions. The
unexpected strength of these forbidden onsite d-d transitions is attributed to
a considerable hybridization of the selenium p with the chromium d orbitals.

RAdiation through Dust In Galaxies). The code computes self-consistently the
extinction of radiation in a dusty medium (including absorption and scattering)
and the dust emission. METHODS: A binary-tree adaptive grid is used for the
description of the dust distribution. Dust radiation is computed at thermal
equilibrium or under stochastic heating condition, for a distribution of grains
of different radii and materials. The code is applied to the case of a clumpy
galactic disk, including both diffuse dust and a distribution of spherical
clouds modelled on the GMCs of local galaxies. Diffuse and localised sources of
starlight are used, with independent spectra. RESULTS: A model is provided for
the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. The SED of the galaxy from the UV to the submm/mm
range can be well reproduced by: a bulge/disk configuration of old stars
together with an extended dust disk, as suggested by the analysis of
optical/near-infrared images; a clumpy dust distribution of the same mass as
the diffuse dust disk, together with a UV emitting component, half of which in
the form of a diffuse disk and half in sources embedded in clouds. In total, it
is found that about 35% of the bolometric radiation is absorbed (and emitted)
by dust; and that absorption of starlight from the old population contributes
to about 60% of the dust emission. A significant component of the dust emission
from clouds is due to absorption of diffuse radiation. Radial profiles of dust
emission in a clumpy disk are almost independent of the wavelength, with the
exception of the wavelength range on the Wien side of the thermal equilibrium
peak.

$\bar K$ effective mass gets lowered by about -50 MeV in cold nuclear matter at
saturation density and by half this reduction at T=100 MeV. The p-wave
contribution to the ${\bar K}$ optical potential, due to $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$
and $\Sigma^*$ excitations, becomes significant for momenta larger than 200
MeV/c and reduces the attraction felt by the $\bar K$ in the nuclear medium.The
$\bar K$ spectral function spreads over a wide range of energies, reflecting
the melting of the $\Lambda (1405)$ resonance and the contribution of $YN^{-1}$
components at finite temperature. In the $KN$ sector, we find that the
low-density theorem is a good approximation for the $K$ self-energy close to
saturation density due to the absence of resonance-hole excitations. The $K$

to a thermal accretion disk with innermost temperature of 250-600 eV. The

source is most likely a black hole low mass X-ray binary. M31N 2006-11a is a
nova that was previously observed in the optical. We detected it both in X-rays

$4^n$ squares of side-length $4^{-n}$. The chance that a long needle thrown at
random in the unit square will meet $\K_n$ is essentially the average length of

demonstrate that the amplitude of the positional modulation of the NbO6

of the modulation is the partial occupation of the pentagonal channels by Sr

the smaller Sr atoms, which leads to a larger deformation of the surrounding
lattice and hence to a larger modulation amplitude. The more homogeneous the
filling of these channels with one atomic type (Ba) the lower the modulation
amplitude. Our results also show that the structure can be described with a
two-dimensional incommensurate harmonic modulation. No second order modulation
has been observed, both by single crystal diffraction measurements and q-scans.
The positional modulation of the Nb atoms is much smaller than that of the

approaches in the literature. DescribeX supports the construction of
heterogeneous summaries where different document elements sharing a common
structure can be declaratively defined and refined by means of path regular
expressions on axes, or axis path regular expression (AxPREs). DescribeX can
significantly help in the understanding of both the structure of complex,
heterogeneous XML collections and the behaviour of XPath queries evaluated on
them.
  Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of DescribeX summary
refinements and stabilizations (the key enablers for tailoring summaries) with
multi-gigabyte web collections. A comparative study suggests that using a
DescribeX summary created from a given workload can produce query evaluation
times orders of magnitude better than using existing summaries. DescribeX's
light-weight approach of combining summaries with a file-at-a-time XPath
processor can be a very competitive alternative, in terms of performance, to
conventional fully-fledged XML query engines that provide DB-like functionality

reionization history. By considering two physically motivated scenarios in
which reionization ends either early (ERM, z_i ~ 7) or late (LRM, z_i ~ 6), we
fix the global value of the IGM neutral fraction (e.g. chi_{HI}=3 times
10^{-4}, 0.15 at z=6.56 for the ERM and LRM, respectively) leaving only the
star formation efficiency and the effective escape fraction of Lya photons as
free parameters. The ERM fits the observed LAE luminosity function (LF) at
z=5.7 and 6.56 requiring no redshift evolution or mass dependence of the star
formation efficiency, and LAE star formation rates (SFR) of 3-103 solar
masses/year, contributing approximately 8% of the cosmic SFR density at z=5.7.
The LRM requires a physically uncomfortable drop of approximately 4.5 times in
the SFR of the emitters from z=6.5 to 5.7. Thus, the data seem to imply that
the Universe was already highly ionized at z=6.56. The mass-dependent Lya
transmissivity is between 0.36-0.51 (ERM) and less than 0.26 (LRM) at z=6.56.
The LF data at z=4.5 imply an extra Lya line damping factor of approximately
0.25 possibly due to dust; the presence of a (clumpy) dust component with
E(B-V) ~ 0.28 is also required to reproduce the observed large Lya equivalent
widths at the same redshift. Additional useful information can be extracted
from the line profile (weighted) skewness, found to be S_W=10-17 Angstrom for
the two reionization models, which shows an interesting L_alpha-chi_{HI}
anti-correlation, holding under the model assumptions. The shortcomings of the
model and strategies to overcome them are discussed.

current-voltage curves which can be characterized by their switching current,
the value of applied current at which the junctions switch to the energy-gap
voltage. The value of the switching current is strongly affected by temperature
and by the presence of fluxons in the system. We observe a very small voltage
(0.2 nV) across the ring prior to switching, indicating a low-velocity fluxon
diffusion state before the jump to a full running state. In analogy with
previous work on single junctions, we analyze the switching current data with
the process of thermal activation over a dissipation barrier, where the system
switches from a low velocity state to a high velocity state. We find that our
data agrees qualitatively with this description, further supporting the
observation of fluxon diffusion.

  Distributions (2007)",,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability
distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et
al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely
studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree
series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of
multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very
convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees.
First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design
learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by
rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series
correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the
structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can
be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol
may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly
relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the
inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are
equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web
Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked
trees.
