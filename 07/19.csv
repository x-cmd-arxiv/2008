investigate the influence of cold dark matter (CDM) substructure on the
dynamical evolution of thin galactic disks. Our method combines cosmological
simulations of galaxy-sized CDM halos to derive the properties of substructure
populations and controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts
onto initially-thin, fully-formed disk galaxies. We demonstrate that close
encounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since z~1 should be
common occurrences in LCDM models. In contrast, extremely few satellites in
present-day CDM halos are likely to have a significant impact on the disk
structure. One typical host halo merger history is used to seed controlled
N-body experiments of subhalo-disk encounters. As a result of these accretion
events, the disk thickens considerably at all radii with the disk scale height
increasing in excess of a factor of 2 in the solar neighborhood. We show that
interactions with the subhalo population produce a wealth of distinctive
morphological signatures in the disk stars including: conspicuous flares; bars;
low-lived, ring-like features in the outskirts; and low-density, filamentary
structures above the disk plane. We compare a resulting dynamically-cold,
ring-like feature in our simulations to the Monoceros ring stellar structure in
the MW. The comparison shows quantitative agreement in both spatial
distribution and kinematics, suggesting that such observed complex stellar
components may arise naturally as disk stars are excited by encounters with
subhalos. These findings highlight the significant role of CDM substructure in
setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.

measurements on thin-film transistors as a function of temperature and without
ever exposing the samples to ambient air. Photooxidation of pentacene is shown
to lead to a peak of trap states centered at 0.28 eV from the mobility edge,
with trap densities of the order of 10(18) cm(-3). These trap states need to be
occupied at first and cause a reduction in the number of free carriers, i.e. a
consistent shift of the density of free holes as a function of gate voltage.
Moreover, the exposure to oxygen reduces the mobility of the charge carriers
above the mobility edge. We correlate the change of these transport parameters
with the change of the essential device parameters, i.e. subthreshold
performance and effective field-effect mobility. This study supports the
assumption of a mobility edge for charge transport, and contributes to a
detailed understanding of an important degradation mechanism of organic
field-effect transistors. Deep traps in an organic field-effect transistor
reduce the effective field-effect mobility by reducing the number of free

responsible for ruggedness of the fitness landscape with implications for the
evolution of sex that have been largely unexplored. Here, we describe fitness
landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus \emph{Aspergillus

the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect
in the wild-type strain, and that several local fitness maxima and minima are
present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these
empirical fitness landscapes using simulations. The results show a general
disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the break down by
recombination of genotypes escaping from local peaks. Sex facilitates escape
from a local peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating
its dependence on the landscape's topography. We discuss possible reasons for
the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of

the inner edge of the accretion disks. Previous studies had found no
differences in flaring between diskfree and accreting systems other than a
small overall diminution of X-ray luminosity in accreting systems. The most
important finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating diskfree stars
can significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop
sizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This
is consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction where the inner
disk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere. We also find two
differences between flares in accreting and diskfree PMS stars. First, a
subclass of super-hot flares with peak plasma temperatures exceeding 100 MK are
preferentially present in accreting systems. Second, we tentatively find that
accreting stars produce flares with shorter durations. Both results may be
consequences of the distortion and destabilization of the stellar magnetosphere
by the interacting disk. Finally, we find no evidence that any flare types,
even slow-rise flat-top flares are produced in star-disk magnetic loops. All

exist is an outcome of the underlying symmetries and is confirmed by
experiments and observations, which furnish their actual values. Specifically,
it turns out on these foundations that the kinematical group of special
relativity is the de Sitter group $dS(c,\Lambda)=SO(1,4)$. On this basis, we
develop at an elementary classical and, hopefully, sufficiently didactical
level the main aspects of the theory of special relativity based on SO(1,4) (de
Sitter relativity). As an application, we apply the formalism to an intrinsic
formulation of point particle kinematics describing both inertial motion and
particle collisions and decays.

theorems on super linear algebra and its properties are proved. Some theorems
are left as exercises for the reader. These new class of super linear algebras
which can be thought of as a set of linear algebras, following a stipulated
condition, will find applications in several fields using computers. The
authors feel that such a paradigm shift is essential in this computerized

century old. Super linear algebras that use super matrices can store data not
only in a block but in multiple blocks so it is certainly more powerful than
the usual matrices. This book has 3 chapters. Chapter one introduces the notion
of super vector spaces and enumerates a number of properties. Chapter two
defines the notion of super linear algebra, super inner product spaces and
super bilinear forms. Several interesting properties are derived. The main
application of these new structures in Markov chains and Leontief economic

resolution (R = 100). Synthetic planetary spectra from T. Barman are used as an
input. Standard chi2-fitting methods are then used to reconstruct planetary
spectra from the simulated data. These simulations show that low-resolution
spectra in the H and K bands can be retrieved with a good fidelity for half a
dozen targets in a reasonable observing time (about 10 hours, spread over a few
nights). Such observations would strongly constrain the planetary temperature

composition of their atmospheres. Systematic errors, not included in our

flash, which takes place at the tip of the RGB and is followed by a series of
secondary flashes before the star settles on the zero-age HB (ZAHB). Yet, no
stars have ever been positively identified in this key phase in the life of a
low-mass star (hereafter the ""pre-ZAHB"" phase). We investigate the possibility
that some pre-ZAHB stars may cross the instability strip (IS), thus becoming

the first theoretical effort devoted to interpreting some of the high-P-dot

the Garching Stellar Evolution Code for a chemical composition appropriate to
the case of the globular cluster M3, where a number of stars with high P-dot
values are found. We follow each star's pre-ZAHB evolution in detail, compute
periods and P-dot values for the stars lying inside the IS, and produce
pre-ZAHB Monte Carlo simulations for the case of M3. Our results indicate that
one should expect of order 1 pre-ZAHB star for every 60 or so bona-fide HB
stars in M3. Among the pre-ZAHB stars, ~22% are expected to fall within the IS
boundaries, presenting RRL-like pulsations. On average, the pre-ZAHB pulsators
are expected to have longer periods than the bona-fide HB pulsators, and 76% of
them are predicted to show negative P-dot values. The most likely P-dot value
for the pre-ZAHB variables is ~-0.3 d/Myr, but more extreme P-dot values are
also possible: 38% of the variables are predicted to have P-dot < -0.8 d/Myr.
It appears likely, therefore, that some RRL stars in M3 with high (absolute)
P-dot values are pre-ZAHB pulsators in disguise. (abridged)

masses ranging from 10^{11.5} to 10^{15.0} h^{-1}M_{Sun}. We propose a modified
form of the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) approximation: \rho(r)=\rho_{NFW}(r)+
A (r/R_{vir})^{-1}+B (1+r/R_{vir})^{-1}. This generalized expression, which is
applicable to the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightly
affects the density in the inner regions of haloes. The strong correlation
among the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profile
in terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. We integrate our density
profile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given radius and compare
it with the NFW results. We find that the NFW underestimates the enclosed mass
by more than 50% at 10R_{vir}, whereas our model reproduces the results from
numerical simulations to within 2% accuracy even at this distance. We also use
this new approximation to study the weak gravitational lensing and to obtain an
analytic expression for the tangential shear. This allows us to quantify the
contribution to the shear from the outer regions of the density profile. For
the first time we calculate the difference between the tangential shear
calculated via the NFW profile and the corresponding result when the external
regions of haloes in cosmological simulations are taken into account. We find a
4% difference for all the mass ranges under study.

based on the linearized General Relativity of gravitational radiation.) We
specifically treat kicks arising in the binary interaction of equal mass black
holes, when at least one of the black holes has significant spin, a. Such
configurations can produce very large kicks in computational simulations. We
consider both fly-by and quasicircular orbits. For fly-by orbits we find
substantial kicks from those Thorne-Kidder terms which are linear in a. For the
quasi-circular case, we consider in addition the nonlinear contribution
(O(a^2)) to the kicks, and provide a dynamical explanation for such terms.
However, in the cases of maximal kick velocities, the dependence on spin is
largely linear (reproduced in numerical results).

string theory has drawn renewed interest to the cosmological role of unusual
scalar field dynamics, usually referred to as k-inflation. In this situation,
the standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological
perturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform
approximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor
perturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to
the sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive
derivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow
functions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to
next to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the
existence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the
present context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the
sonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the
sound speed are also required. Our method is then applied to various models
encountered in the literature. After deriving a generic slow-roll trajectory
valid for any DBI model, simple formulae for the cosmological observables are
obtained. In particular, the running, as the spectral index, for the so-called
UV and IR brane inflationary models is found to be uniquely determined by the
't Hooft coupling. Finally, the accuracy of these cosmological predictions is
assessed by comparing the analytical approximations with exact numerical
integrations.

inherent orthogonality between a simplicial lattice and its circumcentric dual

understanding of simplicial spacetimes has been demonstrated in the literature
for spacetimes devoid of all non-gravitational sources. However, this

Consequently, a deep understanding of the diffeomorphic structure of the
discrete theory is lacking. Conservation laws and symmetry properties are
attractive starting points for coupling matter with the lattice. We present a
simplicial form of the contracted Bianchi identity which is based on the E.
Cartan moment of rotation operator. This identity manifests itself in the
conceptually-simple form of a Kirchhoff-like conservation law. This

rise to the formation of circumstellar nebulae which are both predicted and

properties of such nebulae for blue supergiants. From stellar evolution
calculations including rotation, we obtain the time dependence of the stellar
wind properties and of the stellar radiation field. These are used as input for
hydro-calculations of the circumstellar medium throughout the star's life.
Here, we present the results for a rapidly rotating 12 solar masses single
star. This star undergoes a blue loop during its post main sequence evolution,
at the onset of which its contraction spins it up close to critical rotation.
Due to the consequent anisotropic mass loss, the blue supergiant wind sweeps up
the preceding slow wind into an hour glass structure. Its collision with the
previously formed spherical red supergiant wind shell forms a short-lived
luminous nebula consisting of two polar caps and a central inner ring. With
time, the polar caps evolve into mid-latitude rings which gradually move toward
the equatorial plane while the central ring is fading. These structures are
reminiscent to the observed nebulae around the blue supergiant Sher 25 and the
progenitor of SN 1987A. The simple model of an hour glass colliding with a
spherical shell retrieves most of the intriguing nebula geometries discovered
around blue supergiants, and suggests them to form an evolutionary sequence.

transport in semiconductors including the spin-Hall effect. In the weak
momentum scattering regime the steady-state density matrix contains two
contributions, one linear in the carrier number density $n$ and characteristic
scattering time $\tau$, the other independent of either. In this paper we take
the Liouville equation as our starting point and demonstrate that these two
contributions can be identified with pseudospin conservation and
non-conservation respectively, and are connected in a non-trivial manner by
scattering processes. The scattering term has a distinct form, which is
peculiar to graphene and has important consequences in transport. The
contribution linear in $\tau$ is analogous to the part of the spin density
matrix which yields a steady state spin density, while the contribution
independent of $\tau$, is analogous to the part of the spin density matrix
which yields a steady state spin current. Unlike in systems with spin-orbit
interactions, the $n$ and $\tau$-independent part of the conductivity is
reinforced in the weak momentum scattering regime by scattering between the
conserved and non-conserved pseudospin distributions.

parent sample of 248 galaxies from the HST Groth Strip Survey. We apply a
conservative criterion to identify bulges and potential precursors of
present-day bulges based on nuclear surface brightness excess above the
exponential profile of the outer parts. We measure bulge colours on wedge
profiles opening on the semi-minor axis, and compare them to disk, and global
galaxy colours. For 60% of galaxies with bulges, the rest-frame nuclear colour
distribution shows a red sequence that is well fit by passive evolution models
of various ages, while the remainder 40% scatters towards bluer colours. In
contrast, galaxies without central brightness excess show typical colours of
star forming population and lack a red sequence. We also see that, as in the
local Universe, most of the minor axis colour profiles are negative (bluer
outward), and fairly gentle, indicating that nuclear colours are not distinctly
different from disk colours. This is corroborated when comparing nuclear,
global and disk colours: these show strong correlations, for any value of the
central brightness prominence of the bulge. Comparison with synthetic models of
red sequence bulge colours suggests that such red bulges have stopped forming
stars at an epoch earlier than ~ 1 Gyr before the observation. The correlation
between nuclear and disk colours and the small colour gradients hints at an
intertwined star formation history for bulges and disks: probably, most of our
red bulges formed in a process in which truncation of star formation in the
bulge did not destroy the disk.

we consider in detail the specific brane world model case of neglecting the
terms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic
terms. A small brane tension and a high value of the dark radiation term tend
to decrease the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the
hadronic fluid, respectively, and to significantly accelerate the transition to
a pure hadronic phase. By assuming that the phase transition may be described
by an effective nucleation theory, we also consider the case where the Universe
evolved through a mixed phase with a small initial supercooling and

without approximations on the relevant cross-sections accounting for Compton
scattering, synchrotron radiation, and Coulomb collisions. In the absence of
external soft photons, the electrons are efficiently thermalized by synchrotron
self-absorption and Coulomb scattering even for pure nonthermal electron
injection. The resulting quasi-thermal synchrotron self-Compton spectra have
very stable slopes and electron temperatures similar to the hard states of
BHBs. The hard spectral slopes observed in the X-rays, the cutoff at 100 keV,
and the MeV tail together require low magnetic fields ruling out the magnetic
dissipation mechanism. The motion of the accretion disk toward the black hole
results in larger Compton cooling and lower equilibrium electron temperature.
Our self-consistent simulations show that in this case both electron and photon
distributions attain a power-law-dominated shape similar to what is observed in
the soft state. The electron distribution in the Cyg X-1 soft state might
require a strong magnetic field, being consistent with the magnetically

serve as an efficient means of synthesising spectral channels. However aliasing
corrupts the edge channels so they usually have to be excluded from the data
set. In systems with around 10 channels, the loss in sensitivity can be
significant. In addition, the low level of residual aliasing in the remaining
channels may cause systematic errors. Moreover, delay errors have been widely
reported in implementations of broadband analogue correlators and simulations
have shown that delay errors exasperate the effects of aliasing. Aims: We
describe a software-based approach that suppresses aliasing by oversampling the
cross-correlation function. This method can be applied to interferometers with
individually-tracking antennas equipped with a discrete path compensator
system. It is based on the well-known property of interferometers where the
drift scan response is the Fourier transform of the source's band-limited
spectrum. Methods: In this paper, we simulate a single baseline interferometer,
both for a real and a complex correlator. Fringe-rotation usually compensates
for the phase of the fringes to bring the phase centre in line with the
tracking centre. Instead, a modified fringe-rotation is applied. This enables
an oversampled cross-correlation function to be reconstructed by gathering
successive time samples. Results: Simulations show that the oversampling method
can synthesise the cross-power spectrum while avoiding aliasing and works
robustly in the presence of noise. An important side benefit is that it
naturally accounts for delay errors in the correlator and the resulting
spectral channels are regularly gridded.

spacetime has only one Killing vector. It is along the z-axis and hypersurface
orthogonal. We solve the Einstein equations to first order in the wave
amplitude and superpose such linearized solutions to form a wave pulse. We then
solve the relevant Einstein equation to second order in the amplitude to find
the rotation of inertial frames produced by the pulse. The rotation is without

of the influence of the stress-energy-momentum tensor alone but must involve
also influences of gravitational wave energy and angular momentum.

order to maximize its own utility, which is defined as the ratio of data
throughput to transmit power; the case in which non-linear interference
cancellation is used at the receiver is also investigated. Applying a

for damped oscillators. From the Jacobi three terms recursive relation for the
denominators of the Pad\'e Approximations built on the well-known Z-transform
of an infinite time-series, we build an Hilbert space operator, a J-Operator,
where each bound state (inside the unit circle in the complex plane) is simply
associated to one damped oscillator while the continuous spectrum of the
J-Operator, which lies on the unit circle itself, is shown to represent the
noise. Signal and noise are thus clearly separated in the complex plane. For a
finite time series of length 2N, the J-operator is replaced by a finite order
J-Matrix J_N, having N eigenvalues which are time reversal covariant. Different
classes of input noise, such as blank (white and uniform), Gaussian and pink,
are discussed in detail, the J-Matrix formalism allowing us to efficiently
calculate hundreds of poles of the Z-transform. Evidence of a universal
behaviour in the final statistical distribution of the associated poles and
zeros of the Z-transform is shown. In particular the poles and zeros tend, when
the length of the time series goes to infinity, to a uniform angular
distribution on the unit circle. Therefore at finite order, the roots of unity
in the complex plane appear to be noise attractors. We show that the
Z-transform presents the exceptional feature of allowing lossless undersampling
and how to make use of this property. A few basic examples are given to suggest

$H(e)$ in $S$ is a (closed) topological subgroup in $S$; (ii) the Clifford part
$H(S)$(i.e. the union of all maximal subgroups) of the semigroup $S$ is a
closed subset in $S$; (iii) the inversion $\operatorname{inv}\colon H(S)\to

$\pi\colon x\longmapsto xx^{-1}$, onto the subset of idempotents $E(S)$ of $S$,

selections have an affirmative solution for continuous set-valued mappings in
finite-dimensional Banach spaces. We prove that this happens when images of
set-valued mappings or even their graphs are P-sets (in the sense of Balashov)
or strictly convex sets. We also consider an example which shows that there is
no affirmative solution of this problem even in the simplest case in $\R^{3}$.
We also obtain affirmative solution of the Approximate splitting problem for
Lipschitz continuous selections in the Hilbert space.
