emission has an extent of less than 320 pc, has an optically-thin synchrotron
spectrum with a spectral index -0.76+/-0.05, is less than 11 percent linearly
polarized, and is steady - although poorly sampled - on timescales of weeks and
years. Circumnuclear star formation cannot dominate the radio emission, because
the high inferred star formation rate, 18 Solar masses per year, is
inconsistent with the rate of less than 2 Solar masses per year derived from
narrow Halpha and [OII] 3727 emission. Instead, the radio emission must be
mainly energized by the low-mass black hole. GH 10's radio properties match
those of the steep-spectrum cores of Palomar Seyfert galaxies, suggesting that,
like those Seyferts, the emission is outflow-driven. Because GH 10 is radiating
close to its Eddington limit, it may be a local analog of the starting

only if (\mathcal{A}) is a coset of the stabilizer of (t) points (or

((1-1/e+o(1))(n-t)!). Moreover, if (\mathcal{A}) is the same size as
(\mathcal{D}) then it must be a `double translate' of (\mathcal{D}), meaning
that there exist (\pi,\tau \in S_{n}) such that (\mathcal{A}=\pi \mathcal{D}

(0.44<=x<=0.62), we establish the qualitative change of behavior of the local
magnetic susceptibility at x*=0.63-0.65, from a low x Pauli-like regime to the
high x Curie-Weiss regime. For 0.5<=x<=0.62, the presence of a maximum T* in
the temperature dependence of the susceptibility shows the existence of an
x-dependent energy scale. T_1 relaxation measurements establish the
predominantly antiferromagnetic character of spin correlations for x<x*. This
contradicts the commonly assumed uncorrelated Pauli behavior in this x range
and is at odds with the observed ferromagnetic correlations for x>x*. It is
suggested that at a given x the ferromagnetic correlations might dominate the
antiferromagnetic ones above T*. From 59Co NMR data, it is shown that moving
towards higher x away from x=0.5 results in the progressive appearance of
nonmagnetic Co3+ sites, breaking the homogeneity of Co states encountered for
x<=0.5. The main features of the NMR-detected 59Co quadrupolar effects,
together with indications from the powder x-ray diffraction data, lead us to
sketch a possible structural origin for the Co3+ sites. In light of this
ensemble of new experimental observations, a new phase diagram is proposed,
taking into account the systematic presence of correlations and their
x-dependence.

such that if A \subset S_{n} is an intersecting family of size at least
c(n-1)!, then there exist i and j such that every permutation in A maps i to j
(we call such a family `centred'). They also made the stronger `Hilton-Milner'

suspension of cells; below it, the system remains homogeneous, similarly to the
ordinary phase separation. Second, when cells form a cluster, we have evidence

interstellar medium (ISM) based on self-consistent two-dimensional fluid
simulations. The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid interstellar
medium (ISM) that couples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily
through charge exchange interactions. Charge exchange interactions are
ubiquitous in warm ISM plasma and the strength of the interaction depends
largely on the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike
small length-scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid, charge
exchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety of
length-scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,
relative velocities, charge exchange cross section and the characteristic
length scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid
simulations, that charge exchange interactions modify spectral transfer
associated with large scale energy containing eddies. Consequently, the warm
ISM turbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer amongst inertial range
turbulent modes. Turbulent spectra associated with the neutral and plasma ISM
fluids are therefore steeper than those predicted by Kolmogorov's
phenomenology.

photon intensity of very high energy (VHE) gamma rays, $a_1 \gtrsim 405$ and
$a_2\gtrsim 6.4$ are inferred by the integrated photon fluxes measured by MAGIC
and HESS. Based on this power-law spectrum, the pre-absorbed spectra are
inferred by correcting the photon-photon absorption on the diffuse photons of
the BLR (internal absorption) and the extragalactic background light (external
absorption). Position of gamma-ray emitting region $R_{\rm{\gamma}}$ determines
the relative contributions of this two diffuse radiation to the total
absorption for 10 GeV--1 TeV gamma rays. The internal absorption could make
spectral shape of gamma rays more complex than only corrected for the external
absorption, and could lead to the formation of arbitrary softening and
hardening gamma-ray spectra. It should be necessary for the internal absorption
to be considered in studying 10 GeV--1 TeV gamma rays from powerful blazars.
The energies of annihilated gamma-ray photons due to the internal absorption
are likely to be mainly reradiated around GeV. Our results indicate that
$R_{\rm{\gamma}}$ may be between the inner and outer radii of the BLR for 3C
279. This implies for powerful blazars that $R_{\rm{\gamma}}$ might be neither
inside the BLR cavity nor outside the BLR, but be within the BLR shell.

radius $R_{\gamma}$, the BLR luminosity $L_{\rm{BLR}}$, the BLR half thickness
$h$ and the ratio $\tau_{\rm{BLR}}/f_{\rm{cov}}$ of the Thomson optical depth
to the covering factor of BLR. For FSRQs, on average, it is impossible for
gamma-rays with energies from 10 to 200 GeV to escape from the diffuse
radiation field of the BLR. If $\it GLAST$ could detect these gamma-rays for
most of FSRQs, the gamma-ray emitting region is likely to be outside the cavity

generalized Pastur equation. Two independent parameters govern the behaviour of
the system: The strength $\alpha^2$ of the coupling between positive- and
negative-energy states and the distance between the origin and the centers of
the two semicircles that describe the average spectrum for $\alpha^2 = 0$, the
latter measured in units of the equal radii of the two semicircles. With
increasing $\alpha^2$, positive- and negative-energy states become mixed and
ever more of the spectral strength of the positive-energy states is transferred
to those at negative energy, and vice versa. The two semicircles are deformed
and pulled toward each other. As they begin to overlap, the RPA equations yield
non--real eigenvalues: The system becomes unstable. We determine analytically

we consider its period matrix P, which is analogous to the period matrix of an
elliptic curve defined over a number field. Suppose that the characteristic of
F_q is odd and rho is without complex multiplication. We show that the
transcendence degree of the field generated by the entries of P over F_q(theta)
is 4. As a consequence, we show also the algebraic independence of Drinfeld
logarithms of algebraic functions which are linearly independent over
F_q(theta).

universe that is closed, isotropic and expanding,suggests that under certain
circumstances an additional and previously unidentified acceleration, a_A, can
arise affecting the four dimensional motion of spacecraft. The two cases of
this acceleration being either real or virtual are considered. In the real
case, simple estimates of a_A are shown to be in partial agreement with
reported acceleration anomalies from several Earth flybys and from the Pioneer
spacecraft. However, these estimates do not fully reconcile with radio Doppler
tracking data. The virtual case, by contrast, appears to overcome these and
other difficulties with the real case, and is discussed in an addendum.
Furthermore, the virtual case has an altitude dependence which makes detection
of any anomaly unlikely above ~2000 km. Equations governing this additional
acceleration have been derived from first principles, without the introduction
of free parameters or new constants and without amendment to the law of
gravity.

moments (MDMs) and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in a class of models
characterized by the flavour symmetry A4 x Z3 x U(1)_{FN}, whose choice is
motivated by the approximate tri-bimaximal mixing observed in neutrino
oscillations. We construct the relevant low-energy effective Lagrangian where
these effects are dominated by dimension six operators, suppressed by the scale
M of new physics. All the flavour breaking effects are universally described by
the vacuum expectation values <Phi> of a set of spurions. We separately analyze
both a supersymmetric and a general case. While the observed discrepancy delta
a_mu in the anomalous MDM of the muon suggests M of order of a few TeV, several
data require M above 10 TeV, in particular the limit on EDM of the electron. In
the general case also the present limit on BR(mu -> e gamma) requires M >10
TeV, at least. The branching ratios for mu -> e gamma, tau -> mu gamma and tau
-> e gamma are all expected to be of the same order. In the supersymmetric case
the constraint from mu -> e gamma is softened and it can be satisfied by a
smaller scale M. In this case both the observed delta a_mu and the current
bound on BR(mu -> e gamma) can be satisfied, at the price of a rather small
value for |<Phi>|, of the order of a few percents, that reflects on a similar
value for theta_{13}.
