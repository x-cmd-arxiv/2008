design and produce affinity reagents (target) to any protein query. It is based
on the recent concept of Proteomic Code (for review see Biro, 2007 [1]) which
suggests that significant number of amino acids in specifically interacting
proteins are coded by partially complementary codons. It means that the 1st and
3rd residues of codons coding many co-locating amino acids are complementary
but the 2nd may but not necessarily complementary: like 5'-AXG-3'/3'-CXT-5'
codon pair, where X is any nucleotide.
  Results: A mixture of 45 residue long, reverse, partially complementary
oligonucleotide sequences (target pool) were synthesized to selected epitopes
of query mRNA sequences. The 2nd codon residues were randomized. The target
oligonucleotide pool was inserted into vectors, expressed and the protein
products were screened for affinity to the query in Bacterial Two-Hybrid
System. The best clones were used for larger-scale protein syntheses and
characterization. It was possible to design and produce specific and with high
affinity reacting (Kd:100 nM) oligopeptide reagents to GAL4 query
oligopeptides.
  Conclusions: Second codon residue randomization is a promising method to
design and produce affinity peptides to any protein sequences. The method has
the potential to be a rapid, inexpensive, high throughput, non-immunoglobulin
based alternative to recent in vivo antibody generating procedures.

explosions such as long-duration gamma-ray bursts and pair-instability
supernovae when they die as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Here we determine
the feasibility of searching for these CCSNe in metal-poor dwarf galaxies using
various survey strategies. Methods: We determine oxygen abundances and
star-formation rates for all spectroscopically typed star-forming galaxies in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 5, within z = 0.04. We then estimate
the CCSN rates for sub-samples of galaxies with differing upper-metallicity
limits. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we then predict the fraction of these
CCSNe that we can expect to detect using different survey strategies. Results:
Using a single 2m telescope (with a standard CCD camera) search we predict a
detection rate of ~1.3 CCSNe/yr in galaxies with metallicities below 12 +
log(O/H) < 8.2 which are within a volume that will allow detailed follow-up
with 4m and 8m telescopes (z = 0.04). With a network of seven 2m telescopes we
estimate ~9.3 CCSNe/yr could be found, although this would require more than
1,000 hrs of telescope time allocated to the network. Within the same radial
distance, a volume-limited search in the future Pan-STARRS PS1 all-sky survey
should uncover 12.5 CCSNe/yr in low-metallicity galaxies. Over a period of a
few years this would allow a detailed comparison of their properties. We then
extend our calculations to determine the total numbers of CCSNe that can
potentially be found in magnitude-limited surveys with PS1 (24,000/yr, within z
< 0.6), PS4 (69,000/yr, within z < 0.8) and LSST (160,000/yr, within z < 0.9)

with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) as high as 56K [1-7],
naturally raising comparisons with the high Tc copper oxides. The copper oxides
have layered crystal structures with quasi-two-dimensional electronic
properties, which led to speculations that reduced dimensionality (that is,
extreme anisotropy) is a necessary prerequisite for superconductivity at
temperatures above 40 K [8,9]. Early work on the iron-arsenic compounds seemed
to support this view [7,10]. Here we report measurements of the electrical
resistivity in single crystals of (Ba,K)Fe2As2 in a magnetic field up to 60 T.
We find that the superconducting properties are in fact quite isotropic, being
rather independent of the direction of the applied magnetic fields at low
temperature. Such behaviour is strikingly different from all previously-known
layered superconductors [9,11], and indicates that reduced dimensionality in
these compounds is not a prerequisite for high-temperature superconductivity.
We suggest that this situation arises because of the underlying electronic
structure of the iron-arsenide compounds, which appears to be much more three
dimensional than that of the copper oxides. Extrapolations of low-field
single-crystal data incorrectly suggest a high anisotropy and a greatly
exaggerated zero-temperature upper critical field.

an isolated resonator, as well as one that is coupled to a heat bath at either

dynamics can be probed using technology that is almost within reach. Numerical
solutions of the equations of motion display the first quantum corrections to

soft selective sweeps. We extend an approach that has recently been developed

noncommutative tori with Gabor analysis, where the first has its roots in
operator algebras and the second in time-frequency analysis. Therefore we are
in the position to invoke modern methods of operator algebras, e.g. topological
stable rank of Banach algebras, to exploit the deeper properties of Gabor
frames. Furthermore we are able to extend results due to Connes and Rieffel on
projective modules over noncommutative tori to Banach algebras, which arise in
a natural manner in Gabor analysis. The main goal of this investigation is
twofold: (i) an interpretation of projective modules over noncommutative tori
in terms of Gabor analysis and (ii) that the Morita-Rieffel equivalence between
noncommutative tori is the natural framework for the duality theory of Gabor
frames. More concretely, we interpret generators of projective modules over
noncommutative tori as the Gabor atoms of multi-window Gabor frames for
modulation spaces. Moreover, we show that this implies the {\it existence} of
good multi-window Gabor frames for modulation spaces with Gabor atoms in
Feichtinger's algebra and in Schwartz space.

We intend to provide colour profiles for both samples, as well as measurements
of nuclear, disk, and global colours, which may be used to constrain the

galaxies in images from the HST/WFPC2 Groth Strip survey, which is divided into
two subsamples of higher and lower inclination to assess the role of dust in
the measures quantities. Mergers are visually identified and excluded. We take
special care to control the pollution by ellipticals. The bulge sample is
defined with a criterion based on nuclear surface brightness excess over the
inward extrapolation of the exponential law fitted to the outer regions of the
galaxies. We extract colour profiles on the semi-minor axis least affected by
dust in the disk, and measure nuclear colours at 0.85 kpc from the centre over
those profiles. Disk colours are measured on major axis profiles; global
colours are obtained from 2.6""-diameter apertures. We obtain a parent sample
containing 248 galaxies with known redshifts, spectroscopic or photometric,
spanning 0.1 < z < 1.2. The bulge subsample comprises 54 galaxies (21.8% of the
total), while the subsample with no measureable bulges is 55.2% of the total
(137 galaxies). The remainder (23%) is composed of mergers. We list nuclear,
disk, and global colours (observed and restframe) and magnitudes (apparent and
absolute), as well as galaxy colour gradients for the samples with and without

problem does not arise. It is shown that a system can be simultaneously
quasiclassical in relative momentum and energy only if the cosmological
constant is not anomalously small. We explicitly construct the relative
distance operator. The corresponding eigenvectors differ from standard ones at
both, large and small momenta. At large momenta they ensure fast convergence of

that the cosmological constant is finite. We argue that gravity might be a

asymptote to unstable stationary states of the BCS Hamiltonian with zero order
parameter (normal states), while the anomalous ones tend to eigenstates

the relationship between the growth time and the cycle amplitude. Also, on the

in turbulent convection of a fluid heated from below in a cylindrical container
of aspect ratio one are presented and used to test a model of diffusion in a
potential well for the LSC. The model consists of a pair of stochastic ordinary
differential equations motivated by the Navier-Stokes equations. The two
coupled equations are for the azimuthal orientation theta_0, and for the
azimuthal temperature amplitude delta at the horizontal midplane. The dynamics
is due to the driving by Gaussian distributed white noise that is introduced to
represent the action of the small-scale turbulent fluctuations on the
large-scale flow. Measurements of the diffusivities that determine the noise
intensities are reported. Two time scales predicted by the model are found to
be within a factor of two or so of corresponding experimental measurements. A
scaling relationship predicted by the model between delta and the Reynolds
number is confirmed by measurements over a large experimental parameter range.
The Gaussian peaks of probability distributions p(delta) and p(\dot\theta_0)
are accurately described by the model; however the non-Gaussian tails of
p(delta) are not. The frequency, angular change, and amplitude bahavior during
cessations are accurately described by the model when the tails of the
probability distribution of $\delta$ are used as experimental input.

encompassing: i) the spontaneous emission case, where the system decays from a

of a continuous, incoherent pump. While the former case has been amply
discussed in the literature (albeit mainly for the case of resonance), no
consideration has been given to the influence of the incoherent pump. We show
how, by provoking a self-consistent quantum state, the pump considerably alters
the emission spectra, even at vanishing intensities. The main outcome of our
analysis is to unambiguously identify strong-coupling in situations where it
appears in disguise or only seems to appear. Here, we consider bosonic matter
fields, in which case fully analytical solutions can be obtained. This
describes the case of quantum wells or large quantum dots, or the limit of low
excitation where the average populations remain much smaller than one.

function'' defined on a F_q-algebra and used it to construct linear codes,
obtaining among them the algebraic-geometric (AG) codes supported on one point.
Later it was proved by Matsumoto that all codes produced using a weight
function are actually AG codes supported on one point. Recently, ``near weight
functions'' (a generalization of weight functions), also defined on a
F_q-algebra, were introduced to study codes supported on two points. In this
paper we show that an algebra admits a set of m near weight functions having a
compatibility property, namely, the set is a ``complete set'', if and only if
it is the ring of regular functions of an affine geometrically irreducible
algebraic curve defined over F_q whose points at infinity have a total of m
rational branches. Then the codes produced using the near weight functions are
exactly the AG codes supported on m points. A formula for the minimum distance
of these codes is presented with examples which show that in some situations it
compares better than the usual Goppa bound.

beyond the secular approximation in the dressed-atom cavity field interaction,
we find that if, in addition, the non-secular terms are included into the
dynamics of the system, then non-linear processes can occur that lead to
interesting new aspects of cavity field behavior. We calculate variances of the
quadrature phase amplitudes and the incoherent part of the spectrum of the
cavity field and show that they differ qualitatively from those observed under
the secular approximation. In particular, it is found that the non-linear
processes lead to squeezing of the fluctuations of the cavity field below the
quantum shot noise limit. The squeezing depends on the relative population of
the dressed states of the system and is found only if there is no population
inversion between the dressed states. Furthermore, we find a linewidth
narrowing below the quantum limit in the spectrum of the cavity field that is
achieved only when the secular approximation is not made. An interpretation of
the linewidth narrowing is provided in terms of two phase dependent noise
(squeezing) spectra that make up the incoherent spectrum. We establish that the
linewidth narrowing is due squeezing of the fluctuations in one quadrature

distribution, tensile surface stress and interactions with single water
molecules of a natively oxidised Si surface model previously obtained by means
of accurate density functional theory simulations. We have applied the
potential to the case of hydrophilic silicon wafer bonding at room temperature,
revealing maximum room temperature work of adhesion values for natively
oxidised and amorphous silica surfaces of 97 mJ/m2 and 90mJ/m2, respectively,
at a water adsorption coverage of approximately 1 monolayer. The difference
arises from the stronger interaction of the natively oxidised surface with
liquid water, resulting in a higher heat of immersion (203 mJ/m2 vs. 166
mJ/m2), and may be explained in terms of the more pronounced water structuring
close to the surface in alternating layers of larger and smaller density with
respect to the liquid bulk. The computed force-displacement bonding curves may
be a useful input for cohesive zone models where both the topographic details
of the surfaces and the dependence of the attractive force on the initial
surface separation and wetting can be taken into account.

  Forty-nine pulsation frequencies are detected, of which 15 are independent
pulsation modes and 34 combination frequencies or harmonics. The newly found
gravity mode at 5.30 c/d extends the known frequency range of instability.
Strong amplitude variability from year to year is found for the \ell = 1 modes,
while the two radial modes have essentially constant amplitudes. Possible
origins of the amplitude variability of the \ell = 1 modes, such as precession
of the pulsation axis, beating and resonance effects are considered. The
amplitudes of the combination frequencies, f_i + f_j, mirror the variations in

Kuzmin disc and a dark matter spherical halo. We estimate the peculiar
acceleration for all known Galactic globular clusters and find some cases with
an expected velocity shift in excess of 20 cm/sec for observations fifteen
years apart, well above the typical cosmological acceleration. We then compare
the predicted signal for a MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics) model in which
the spherical dark matter halo is absent. We find that the signal pattern is

and inhibitory) but this type of estimation requires at least two Vm levels and
therefore cannot be applied to single Vm traces. We propose here a method to
extract excitatory and inhibitory conductances (mean and variance) from single
Vm traces. This ""VmT method"" estimates conductance parameters using maximum
likelihood criteria, under the assumption are that synaptic conductances are
described by Gaussian stochastic processes and are integrated by a passive
leaky membrane. The method is illustrated using models and is tested on
guinea-pig visual cortex neurons in vitro using dynamic-clamp experiments. The
VmT method holds promises for extracting conductances from single-trial
measurements, which has a high potential for in vivo applications.

region of galaxy clusters, where the galaxy dynamics is dominated by an overall
infall motion towards the cluster centre. In the framework of the spherical
infall model the local mean velocity of the infalling galaxies at every radius
provides information about the integrated matter overdensity $\delta$. Thus, a
well-defined value of the overdensity $\delta_t$ is expected at the turnaround
radius $r_t$, i.e. the radius where the Hubble flow balances the infall motion.
Within this scenario, we analysed the kinematical properties of a large
catalogue of simulated clusters, using both dark matter particles and member
galaxies as tracer of the infall motion. We also compared the simulation with
analytical calculation performed in the spherical infall approximation, to
analyze the dependence of the results on cosmology in spatially flat universe.
If we normalize cluster mass profiles by means of the turnaround mass $M_t$
(i.e. the mass within $r_t$), they are consistent with an exponential profile
in the whole non-equilibrium region ($0.5\la r/r_t\la 2$). Turnaround radii are
proportional to virialization radii ($r_t\simeq 3.5 r_v$), while turnaround
masses are proportional to virialization masses, i.e. $M_t\simeq 1.7 M_v$,
where $M_v$ is the mass within $r_v$. Actually, the mass evaluated within the
turnaround radius is a more exhaustive evaluation of the total mass of the
cluster. These results can be applied to the analysis of observed clusters.

hybridized. The $\Delta$SCF approximation is a density functional method
closely resembling standard density functional theory (DFT), the only
difference being that in $\Delta$SCF one or more electrons are placed in higher
lying Kohn-Sham orbitals, instead of placing all electrons in the lowest
possible orbitals as one does when calculating the ground state energy within
standard DFT. We extend the $\Delta$SCF method by allowing excited electrons to
occupy orbitals which are linear combinations of Kohn-Sham orbitals. With this
extra freedom it is possible to place charge locally on adsorbed molecules in
the calculations, such that resonance energies can be estimated. The method is
applied to N$_2$, CO and NO adsorbed on different metallic surfaces and
compared to ordinary $\Delta$SCF without our modification, spatially
constrained DFT and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) measurements.
This comparison shows that the modified $\Delta$SCF method gives results in
close agreement with experiment, significantly closer than the comparable
methods. For N$_2$ adsorbed on ruthenium (0001) we map out a 2-dimensional part
of the potential energy surfaces in the ground state and the 2$\pi$-resonance.
Finally we compare the $\Delta$SCF approach on gas-phase N$_2$ and CO, to
higher accuracy methods. Excitation energies are approximated with accuracy
close to that of time-dependent density functional theory, and we see very good
agreement in the minimum shift of the potential energy surfaces in the excited

macromolecules and macromolecular complexes that need to get into and out of
the nucleus. Such bi-directional traffic occurring in a narrow channel can
easily lead to jamming. How then is passage between the nucleus and cytoplasm
maintained under the varying conditions that arise during the lifetime of the
cell? Here, we address this question using computer simulations in which the
behaviour of the ensemble of transporting cargoes is analyzed under different
conditions. We suggest that traffic can exist in two distinct modes, depending
on concentration of cargoes and dissociation rates of the transport
receptor-cargo complexes from the pores. In one mode, which prevails when
dissociation is quick and cargo concentration is low, transport in either
direction proceeds uninterrupted by the other direction. The result is that
overall-traffic-direction fluctuates rapidly and unsystematically between
import and export. Remarkably, when cargo concentrations are high and
dissociation is slow, another mode takes over in which traffic proceeds in one
direction for a certain extent of time, after which it flips direction for
another period. The switch between this, more regulated, mode of transport and
the other, quickly fluctuating state, does not require an active gating
mechanism but rather occurs spontaneously through the dynamics of the
transported particles themselves. The determining factor for the behaviour of
traffic is found to be the exit rate from the pore channel, which is directly
related to the activity of the Ran system that controls the loading and release
of cargo in the appropriate cellular compartment.

key outstanding physical questions. It has been established here that: (i)
reconnection out-of-plane electric field at the magnetic null is generated by
the electron pressure tensor off-diagonal terms, resembling to the case of
tearing unstable Harris current sheet studied by the GEM reconnection
challenge; (ii) For m_i / m_e >> 1 the time evolution of the reconnected flux
is independent of ion-electron mass ratio; also, in the case of m_i / m_e = 1
we show that reconnection proceeds slowly as the Hall term is zero; when m_i /
m_e >> 1 (i.e. the Hall term is non-zero) reconnection is fast and we
conjecture that this is due to magnetic field being frozen into electron fluid,
which moves significantly faster than ion fluid; (iii) within one Alfven time,
somewhat less than half (40%) of the initial total (roughly magnetic) energy is
converted into the kinetic energy of electrons, and somewhat more than half
(60%) into kinetic energy of ions (similar to solar flare observations); (iv)
in the strongly stressed X-point case, in about one Alfven time, a full
isotropy in all three spatial directions of the velocity distribution is seen
for super-thermal electrons (also commensurate to solar flare observations).

of non-causal synordination patterns between two series of physical events is
examined. It is necessary that the patterns in question act in a reproducible,
or at least regular, manner, so that they can be identified by means of
statistical analysis; action on individual occasional facts cannot be proved
statistically, though it is hypothetically possible. As established in the
previous work, the first series must be constituted by microevents (Penrose R
processes), that can be amplified at the macroscopic level so that they are
translated at this level into a choice between alternatives. The obtained
result defines (by means of a structural constraint which is not, however, a
causal link) the choice between execution or non-execution of certain actions
on a macroscopic system S, without any feedback on the microevents source. A
succession of macroevents is thus generated, which makes up the second series.
Statistics of the events belonging to the second series is thus completely
defined by the probability distribution of the first series of events. In the
absence of a synordination, this is the a priori probability distribution,
which can be measured by removing the constraint between the two series. If
there is synordination, the probability distribution of the two sets of events
will deviate in a measurable manner from the expected trend once the constraint
is activated.

quantified through theoretical error bands. First, we investigate the
possibility to observe excited Efimov states in 2n halo nuclei. Based on the

Efimov excited state, with an energy less than 7 keV below the scattering

preventing the growth of the r-mode instability. We estimate the damping time

consider is due to the the mutual friction force between the normal and the
superfluid component arising from the elastic scattering of phonons with
quantized vortices. This process is the dominant one for temperatures $T
\lesssim 0.01$ MeV where the mean free path of phonons due to their

described as an ideal bosonic gas. We find that r-modes oscillations are
efficiently damped by this mechanism for pulsars rotating at frequencies of the

distributions with 6-dimensional square on a smooth manifold of arbitrary
dimension n under very mild genericity conditions. The main idea is to consider
the projectivization of the annihilator of a given 3-dimensional distribution.
It is naturally foliated by characteristic curves, which are also called the
abnormal extremals of the distribution. The dynamics of vertical fibers along
characteristic curves defines certain curves of flags of isotropic and
coisotropic subspaces in a linear symplectic space. The problem of equivalence
of distributions can be essentially reduced to the differential geometry of
such curves.
  The class of all 3-distributions under consideration is split into a finite
number of subclasses according to the Young diagram of their flags. The local
geometry of distributions can be recovered from the properties of the symmetry
group of so-called flat curves of flags associated with this Young diagram. In
each subclass we describe the flat distribution and construct a canonical frame
for any other distribution.
  It turns out that for n>6 in the most nontrivial case the symmetry algebra of
the flat distribution can be described in terms of rational normal curves
(their secants and tangential developables) in projective spaces and its
dimension grows exponentially with respect to n.

a 1 mm gap under two different boundary conditions. No-slip conditions, ensured
by using rough walls, lead to shear localization as already reported in various
soft glassy materials. When apparent wall slip is allowed using a smooth
geometry, the sample is shown to break up into macroscopic solid pieces that
get slowly eroded by the surrounding fluidized material up to the point where
the whole sample is fluid. Such a drastic effect of boundary conditions on
yielding suggests the existence of some macroscopic characteristic length that
could be connected to cooperativity effects in jammed materials under shear.

a good OPE convergence and a pole contribution which is bigger than the

we are able to simulate the self-assembly of both DNA duplexes and Holliday
junctions from single-stranded DNA. We find that assembly is most successful in
the temperature window below the melting temperatures of the target structure
and above the melting temperature of misbonded aggregates. Furthermore, in the
case of the Holliday junction, we show how a hierarchical assembly mechanism
reduces the possibility of becoming trapped in misbonded configurations. The
model is also able to reproduce the relative melting temperatures of different
structures accurately, and allows strand displacement to occur.

different types and luminosities along different structural scaling relations
to see whether massive and dwarf ellipticals have been shaped by the same
formation process. This exercise is here done by comparing the distribution of
Virgo cluster massive and dwarf ellipticals and star forming galaxies along the
B band effective surface brightness and effective radius vs. absolute magnitude
relations and the Kormendy relation to the predictions of models tracing the
effects of ram-pressure stripping on disc galaxies entering the cluster
environment and galaxy harassment. Dwarf ellipticals might have been formed
from low luminosity, late-type spirals that recently entered into the cluster
and lost their gas because of a ram-pressure stripping event, stopping their
activity of star formation. The perturbations induced by the abrupt decrease of
the star formation activity are sufficient to modify the structural properties
of disc galaxies into those of dwarf ellipticals. Galaxy harassment induce a
truncation of the disc and generally an increase of the effective surface
brightness of the perturbed galaxies. The lack of dynamical simulations of
perturbed galaxies spanning a wide range in luminosity prevents us to drive any
firm conclusion on a possible harassment-induced origin of the low surface
brightness dwarf elliptical galaxy population inhabiting the Virgo cluster.
Although the observed scaling relations are consistent with the idea that the
distribution of elliptical galaxies along the mentioned scaling relation is
just due to a gradual variation with luminosity of the Sersic index n, the
comparison with models indicates that dwarf ellipticals might have been formed
by a totally different process than giant ellipticals

are caused by the apparent chaotic behavior of the sunspot numbers from cycle
to cycle and by the influence of various turbulent dynamo processes, which are
far from understanding. For predicting the solar cycle properties we make an
initial attempt to use the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a data assimilation
method, which takes into account uncertainties of a dynamo model and
measurements, and allows to estimate future observational data. We present the
results of forecasting of the solar cycles obtained by the EnKF method in
application to a low-mode nonlinear dynamical system modeling the solar
$\alpha\Omega$-dynamo process with variable magnetic helicity. Calculations of
the predictions for the previous sunspot cycles show a reasonable agreement
with the actual data. This forecast model predicts that the next sunspot cycle
will be significantly weaker (by $\sim 30%$) than the previous cycle,
continuing the trend of low solar activity.
