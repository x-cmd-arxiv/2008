cosmological constant -\ell^{-2} and positive Newton constant G admits an AdS_3
vacuum solution for any value of the graviton mass \mu. These are all known to
be perturbatively unstable except at the recently explored chiral point
\mu\ell=1. However we show herein that for every value of \mu\ell< 3 there are
two other (potentially stable) vacuum solutions given by SL(2,R)x
U(1)-invariant warped AdS_3 geometries, with a timelike or spacelike U(1)
isometry.
  Critical behavior occurs at \mu\ell=3, where the warping transitions from a
stretching to a squashing, and there are a pair of warped solutions with a null
U(1) isometry. For \mu\ell>3, there are known warped black hole solutions which
are asymptotic to warped AdS_3. We show that these black holes are discrete
quotients of warped AdS_3 just as BTZ black holes are discrete quotients of
ordinary AdS_3. Moreover new solutions of this type, relevant to any theory
with warped AdS_3 solutions, are exhibited. Finally we note that the black hole
thermodynamics is consistent with the hypothesis that, for \mu\ell>3, the
warped AdS_3 ground state of TMG is holographically dual to a 2D boundary CFT

This duality maps a supersymmetric background to another supersymmetric

certain combination of bosonic and fermionic T-dualities maps the full
superstring theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ back to itself in such a way that
gluon scattering amplitudes in the original theory map to something very close
to Wilson loops in the dual theory. This duality maps the ``dual superconformal

the dual model. This explains the dual superconformal invariance of planar

in Poincare parametrization of AdS5 maps the bosonic part of the superstring
action into itself. On bosonic level, this duality may be understood as a
symmetry of the first-order (phase space) system of equations for the coset
components of the current. The associated Lax connection is invariant modulo
the action of an so(2,4)-automorphism. We then show that this symmetry extends
to the full superstring, provided one supplements the transformation of the
bosonic components of the current with a transformation on the fermionic ones.
At the level of the action, this symmetry can be seen by combining the bosonic
duality transformation with a similar one applied to part of the fermionic
superstring coordinates. As a result, the full superstring action is mapped
into itself, albeit in a different kappa-symmetry gauge. One implication is
that the dual model has the same superconformal symmetry group as the original
one, and this may be seen as a consequence of the integrability of the
superstring. The invariance of the Lax connection under the duality implies a
map on the full set of conserved charges that should interchange some of the
Noether (local) charges with hidden (non-local) ones and vice versa.

soft, diffuse X-ray emission from the inner regions of planetary nebulae.
Although the existing images support the idea that this emission arises from
the hot shocked central-star wind which fills the inner cavity of a planetary
nebula, existing models have difficulties to explain the observations
consistently. We investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changes
the physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of X-ray
emission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae
with central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. The radiation
hydrodynamical models show that heat conduction leads to lower temperatures and
higher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of the
X-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived from
observations. Depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase,
our models predict X-ray [0.45--2.5 keV] luminosities between $10^{-8}$ and
$10^{-4}$ of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with the
observations. Less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this X-ray
band. Although temperature, density, and also the mass of the hot bubble is
significantly altered by heat conduction, the dynamics of the whole system
remains practically the same. Heat conduction allows the construction of
nebular models which predict the correct amount of X-ray emission and at the
same time are fully consistent with the observed mass-loss rate and wind speed.
Thermal conduction must be considered as a viable physical process for
explaining the diffuse X-ray emission from planetary nebulae with closed inner
cavities. Magnetic fields must then be absent or extremely weak.

in the anti-nodal region of momentum space in the superconducting phase of

accessibility to regulatory molecules (proteins, micro-RNAs), its stability and
its level of expression. The mobile elements of the RNA sequence, the wobble
bases, are expected to regulate the formation of structures encompassing coding
sequences.
  Results: The sequence/folding energy (FE) relationship was studied by
statistical, bioinformatic methods in 90 CDS containing 26,370 codons. I found
that the FE (dG) associated with coding sequences is significant and negative
(407 kcal/1000 bases, mean +/- S.E.M.) indicating that these sequences are able
to form structures. However, the FE has only a small free component, less than
10% of the total. The contribution of the 1st and 3rd codon bases to the FE is
larger than the contribution of the 2nd (central) bases. It is possible to
achieve a ~ 4-fold change in FE by altering the wobble bases in synonymous
codons. The sequence/FE relationship can be described with a simple algorithm,
and the total FE can be predicted solely from the sequence composition of the
nucleic acid. The contributions of different synonymous codons to the FE are
additive and one codon cannot replace another. The accumulated contributions of
synonymous codons of an amino acid to the total folding energy of an mRNA is
strongly correlated to the relative amount of that amino acid in the translated
protein.
  Conclusion: Synonymous codons are not interchangable with regard to their
role in determining the mRNA FE and the relative amounts of amino acids in the
translated protein, even if they are indistinguishable in respect of amino acid
coding.

the variations with internuclear distance and with vibrational index of the

including Fr$_2$, and of all heteronuclear alkali dimers involving Li to Cs, in
their electronic ground state and in their lowest triplet state. We use the

exclusive hyperon-antihyperon pair production close to threshold in antiproton
nucleus interactions is proposed. Due to energy and momentum conservation
event-by-event transverse momentum correlations of the produced hyperons and
antihyperons contain information on the difference between their potentials. A
schematic Monte Carlo simulation is used to illustrate the sensitivities of the
proposed method for the reaction 1.66GeV/c antiproton+$^{12}$C $\to
{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}}$. For produced D-meson pairs at 6.7GeV/c the sensitivity
of the transverse momenta correlation will probably be to small to deduce
differences between the potentials for D$^+$ and D$^-$ mesons. However, for
$\Xi\bar{\Xi}$ pairs produced at 2.9GeV/c the asymmetry is sufficiently
sensitive to predicted differences between the $\Xi$ and $\bar{\Xi}$

two offset nuclei within or projected against its disk, at projected distances
of 5.1 and 8.4 kpc from its primary nucleus and at radial velocity separation
of less than 200 km/s from the primary. These appear to be either dwarf
ellipticals or the bulges of low-mass spirals whose disks have already been
stripped off while merging into the primary galaxy. The inner offset nucleus
has a Seyfert 2 spectrum and a stellar velocity dispersion of 70+/-7 km/s. The
outer offset nucleus has very weak emission lines consistent with a LINER
classification, and the primary nucleus has an emission-line spectrum close to
the boundary between LINER/HII composite systems and HII nuclei; both may
contain accreting massive black holes, but the optical classifications alone
are ambiguous. The detection of an offset active nucleus in NGC 3341 provides a
strong suggestion that black hole accretion episodes during minor mergers can
be triggered in the nuclei of dwarf secondary galaxies as well as in the

intermediate-mass black holes identified by Greene & Ho (2004). Spectra
obtained with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager at the Keck Observatory
are used to determine the central stellar velocity dispersions and to examine
the emission-line properties. Overall, the stellar velocity dispersions are low
(40-90 km/s), and we find 12 objects having sigma < 60 km/s, a range where very
few Seyfert 2 galaxies were previously known. The sample follows the
correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and FWHM([OIII]) seen in more
massive Seyfert galaxies, indicating that the narrow-line FWHM values are
largely determined by virial motion of gas in the central regions of the host
galaxies. Using estimates of the black hole masses and AGN bolometric
luminosities, we find that these galaxies are typically radiating at a high
fraction of their Eddington rate, with a median L_bol/L_Edd = 0.4. We identify
one galaxy, SDSS J110912.40+612346.7, as a Type 2 analog of the nearby dwarf
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395, with a nearly identical narrow-line spectrum and a
dwarf spiral host of only M_g = -16.8 mag. Forthcoming observations of this
sample, including X-ray and mid-infrared spectroscopy, can provide new tests of
the obscuring torus model for active galaxies at low luminosities.

denaturisation, to the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition, to
the decoupling of forces in the early universe. Remarkably, phase transitions
can be arranged into universality classes, where systems having unrelated
microscopic physics exhibit identical scaling behaviour near the critical
point. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the
Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition of an atomic gas, focusing on one
prominent universal element of phase transition dynamics: the spontaneous
formation of topological defects during a quench through the transition. While
the microscopic dynamics of defect formation in phase transitions are generally
difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluid phase transitions,
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical
opportunities for probing such details. Although spontaneously formed vortices
in the condensation transition have been previously predicted to occur, our
results encompass the first experimental observations and statistical
characterisation of spontaneous vortex formation in the condensation
transition. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and
quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate
condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with
our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the
development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation
of universal phase-transition dynamics.

method and also using a radial Hamiltonian analysis. The latter formulation
exhibits most clearly the existence of an underlying generalized conformal
structure. In the cases of Dp-branes, the corresponding dual boundary theory,
the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory SYM_{p+1}, indeed exhibits the
generalized conformal structure found at strong coupling. We compute the
holographic 2-point functions of the stress energy tensor and gluon operator
and show they satisfy the expected Ward identities and the constraints of
generalized conformal structure. The holographic results are also manifestly
compatible with the M-theory uplift, with the asymptotic solutions,
counterterms, one and two point functions etc of the IIA F1 and D4
appropriately descending from those of M2 and M5 branes, respectively. We
present a few applications including the computation of condensates in Witten's
model of holographic YM_4 theory.

The outstanding
characteristic of the single-degenerate scenario is that it contains hydrogen
in the binary companion of the exploding white dwarf star, which, if mixed into
the ejecta of the supernova in large amounts may lead to conflicts with the
observations thus ruling out the scenario. We investigate the effect of the
impact of Type Ia supernova ejecta on a main sequence companion star of the
progenitor system. With a series of simulations we investigate how different
parameters of this system affect the amount of hydrogen stripped from the
companion by the impact. The stellar evolution code GARSTEC is used to set up
the structure of the companion stars mimicking the effect of a binary evolution
phase. The impact itself is simulated with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
code GADGET2. We reproduce and confirm the results of earlier grid-based
hydrodynamical simulation. Parameter studies of the progenitor system are
extended to include the results of recent binary evolution studies. The more
compact structure of the companion star found here significantly reduces the
stripped hydrogen mass. The low hydrogen masses resulting from a more realistic
companion structure are consistent with current observational constraints.
Therefore, the single-degenerate scenario remains a valid possibility for Type
Ia supernova progenitors. These new results are not a numerical effect, but the
outcome of different initial conditions.

configurations. The N-band visibilities observed for BM Gem show a steep
decrease from 8 to ~10 micron and a gradual increase longward of ~10 micron,
reflecting the optically thin silicate emission feature emanating from
sub-micron-sized amorphous silicate grains. The differential phases obtained at
baselines of ~44--46 m show significant non-zero values (~ -70 degrees) in the
central part of the silicate emission feature between ~9 and 11 micron,
revealing a photocenter shift and the asymmetric nature of the silicate
emitting region. The observed N-band visibilities and differential phases can
be fairly explained by a simple geometrical model in which the unresolved star
is surrounded by a ring with azimuthal brightness modulation. The best-fit
model is characterized by a broad ring (~70 mas across at 10 micron) with a
bright region which is offset from the unresolved star by ~20 mas at a position
angle of ~280 degrees. This model can be interpreted as a system with a

conical singularities by cutting out a neighbourhood of each singular point and
glueing in an asymptotically conical G_2 manifold. Controlling the error on the
overlap glueing region enables us to use a result of Joyce to conclude that the
resulting compact smooth 7-manifold admits a torsion-free G_2 structure, with
full G_2 holonomy.
  There are topological obstructions for this procedure to work, which arise
from the degree 3 and degree 4 cohomology of the asymptotically conical G_2
manifolds which are glued in at each conical singularity. When a certain
necessary topological condition on the manifold with isolated conical
singularities is satisfied, we can introduce correction terms to the glueing
procedure to ensure that it still works. In the case of degree 4 obstructions,
these correction terms are trivial to construct, but in the case of degree 3
obstructions we need to solve an elliptic equation on a non-compact manifold.
For this we use the Lockhart-McOwen theory of weighted Sobolev spaces on
manifolds with ends. This theory is also used to obtain a good asymptotic
expansion of the G_2 structure on an asymptotically conical G_2 manifold under
an appropriate gauge-fixing condition, which is required to make the glueing
procedure work.

along with morphological samples from several groups of Neotropical electric
fish (Order: Gymnotiformes) were used in this thesis to test the dynamics of
both intraspecific variation and interspecific diversity. In terms of
investigating molecular interspecific diversity among humans, two experimental
exercises were performed. A cladistic exchange experiment tested for the extent
of discontinuity and interbreeding between H. sapiens and neanderthal
populations. As part of the same question, another experimental exercise tested
the amount of molecular variance resulting from simulations which treated
neanderthals as being either a local population of modern humans or as a
distinct subspecies. Finally, comparisons of hominid populations over time with
fish species helped to define what constitutes taxonomically relevant
differences between morphological populations as expressed among both trait
size ranges and through growth patterns that begin during ontogeny. Compared to
the subdivision found within selected teleost species, H. sapiens molecular
data exhibited little variation and discontinuity between geographical regions.
Results of the two experimental exercises concluded that neanderthals exhibit
taxonomic distance from modern H. sapiens. However, this distance was not so
great as to exclude the possibility of interbreeding between the two
subspecific groups. Finally, a series of characters were analyzed among species
of Neotropical electric fish. These analyses were compared with hominid
examples to determine what constituted taxonomically relevant differences
between populations as expressed among specific morphometric traits that
develop during the juvenile phase.

hexagonal Photonic Crystal in the vicinity of the Dirac point. If the crystal
is oriented so that the propagation direction perpendicular to the surface
corresponds to the Gamma-K direction, no oblique transmission is possible for a
very long (infinite) structure. For a finite structure with width, W, and
length, L, the length dependence of the transmission is given by T_total =
Gamma_0 W/L. For T_total all waves with a wavevector parallel to the surface,
k_||=n 2pi/W, described by a channel number, n, must be considered. We show the
transmission at the Dirac point follows the given scaling law and this scaling
law is related to the behavior of the individual channels. This leads to the
establishment of a criterion for the maximum length for this scaling behavior
when the total transmission reaches a constant value. We also compare this
scaling behavior to the results in other frequency regions.

rare structures formed at very high redshift, such as the very first stars and
bright redshift z~6 QSOs, are preferentially located at the center of the most
massive galaxy clusters at redshift z=0. In this paper we readdress this
question using a combination of cosmological simulations of structure formation
and extended Press-Schechter formalism and we show that the typical remnants of
Population III stars are instead more likely to be found in a group
environment, that is in dark matter halos of mass ~2x10^{13} h^{-1}M_sun.
Similarly, the descendants of the brightest z~6 QSOs are expected to be in
medium-sized clusters (mass of a few 10^{14} h^{-1}M_sun), rather than in the
most massive superclusters (M>10^{15} h^{-1}M_sun) found within the typical 1
Gpc^3 cosmic volume where a bright z~6 QSO lives. The origin of past claims
that the most massive clusters preferentially host these remnants is rooted in
the numerical method used to initialize their numerical simulations: Only a
small region of the cosmological volume of interest was simulated with
sufficient resolution to identify low-mass halos at early times, and this
region was chosen to host the most massive halo in the cosmological volume at
late times. The conclusion that the earliest structures formed in the entire
cosmological volume evolve into the most massive halo at late times was thus
arrived at by construction. We demonstrate that, to the contrary, the first
structures to form in a cosmological region evolve into relatively typical
objects at later times. We propose alternative numerical methods for simulating
the earliest structures in cosmological volumes.

and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product

quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence
bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in
both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements
clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band

description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization
giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard
Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the
HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and

transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a

of the negative pressure describing the irreversible process of gravitational
particle creation. A related work involving accelerating CDM cosmology has been
discussed before the SNe observations [Lima, Abramo & Germano, Phys. Rev. D53,
4287 (1996)]. However, in order to have a transition from a decelerating to an
accelerating regime at low redshifts, the matter creation rate proposed here
includes a constant term of the order of the Hubble parameter. In this case,
$H_0$ does not need to be small in order to solve the age problem and the
transition happens even if the matter creation is negligible during the
radiation and part of the matter dominated phase. Therefore, instead of the
vacuum dominance at redshifts of the order of a few, the present accelerating
stage in this sort of Einstein-de Sitter CDM cosmology is a consequence of the
gravitational particle creation process. As an extra bonus, in the present
scenario does not exist the coincidence problem that plagues models with
dominance of dark energy. The model is able to harmonize a CDM picture with the
present age of the universe, the latest measurements of the Hubble parameter
and the Supernovae observations.

highly magnetized neutron star discovered by its sporadic short bursts in the
Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey data. In 94 hrs of observation data, we detected
a total of 162 dispersed bursts of RRAT J1819-1458 with the signal-to-noise
ratios (S/Ns) above 5-$\sigma$ threshold. Among them, 5 bursts clearly show
two-component structure. The S/N of the strongest burst is 13.3. The source's
DM measured through our data is 196.0 $\pm$0.4 pc cm$^{-3}$. The timing
position, frequency and its first derivative were determined using standard
pulsar timing techniques on the arrival times of these individual bursts. The
accuracy of the solved rotating parameters are improved comparing with that in
previous publication. Our timing position with 2-$\sigma$ error is consistent
with the position of its X-ray counterpart CXOU J181934.1-145804. The effect of
timing noise and the phase fluctuation of the individual short bursts on the
timing residuals is briefly discussed. The distribution of the timing residuals
is bimodal, which cannot be explained readily by timing irregularity.

independent of the distribution of the underlying `clean' sequence, is
universally optimal in the limit of large sequence length. This sequence of
denoisers is universal in the sense of performing as well as any sliding window
denoising scheme which may be optimized for the underlying clean signal. Our
results are initially developed in a ``semi-stochastic'' setting, where the
noiseless signal is an unknown individual sequence, and the only source of
randomness is due to the channel noise. It is subsequently shown that in the
fully stochastic setting, where the noiseless sequence is a stationary
stochastic process, our schemes universally attain optimum performance. The
proposed schemes draw from nonparametric density estimation techniques and are
practically implementable. We demonstrate efficacy of the proposed schemes in
denoising gray-scale images in the conventional additive white Gaussian noise

construction of likelihood intervals or regions, instead of a procedure of
point estimation. Based on Fisher's articles and books it is justified that by
estimation Fisher meant the construction of likelihood intervals or regions
from appropriate likelihood function and that an estimate is a statistic, that
is, a function from a sample space to a parameter space such that the
likelihood function obtained from the sampling distribution of the statistic at
the observed value of the statistic is used to construct likelihood intervals
or regions. Thus Problem of Estimation is how to choose the 'best' estimate.
Fisher's solution for the problem of estimation is Maximum Likelihood Estimate
(MLE). Fisher's Theory of Statistical Estimation is a chain of ideas used to
justify MLE as the solution of the problem of estimation. The construction of
confidence intervals by the delta method from the asymptotic normal
distribution of MLE is based on Fisher's ideas, but is against his 'logic of
statistical inference'. Instead the construction of confidence intervals from
the profile likelihood function of a given interest function of the parameter
vector is considered as a solution more in line with Fisher's 'ideology'. A new
method of calculation of profile likelihood-based confidence intervals for
general smooth interest functions in general statistical models is considered.

transient systems in the low hard state is investigated. Taking into account
the combined cooling associated with the Compton and conductive energy
transport processes in a corona, the radial structure of a disk is described
for a range of mass accretion rates. The mass flow in an optically thick inner
region can be maintained by the condensation of matter from a corona with the
disk temperature and luminosity varying continuously as a function of the
accretion rate. Although such a disk component can be present, the contribution
of the optically thick disk component to the total luminosity can be small
since the mass flow due to condensation in the optically thick disk underlying
the corona can be significantly less than the mass flow rate in the corona. The
model is applied to the observations of the low quiescent state of the black
hole source GX 339-4 at luminosities of around $0.01 L_{Edd}$ and is able to
explain the temperature of the thermal component at the observed luminosities.
Since conductive cooling dominates Compton cooling at low mass accretion rates,
the luminosity corresponding to the critical mass accretion rate above which a
weak thermal disk component can be present in the low hard state is estimated
to be as low as $0.001 L_{Edd}$.

energy $\beta=0.17$. The (non-rotating) dark matter halo is described by a
quasi-isothermal sphere. We find that the dynamics of the shell is different in
protogalaxies with and without rotation. For instance, the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability in the shell develops faster in protogalaxies without rotation. The
fraction of a blown-away baryonic mass is approximately twice as large in
models with rotation ($\sim 20%$) than in models without rotation. On the other
hand, the chemical evolution of gas in protogalaxies with and without rotation
is found to be similar. The relative number densities of molecular hydrogen and
HD molecules in the cold gas ($T \le 10^3$ K) saturate at typical values of
$10^{-3}$ and $10^{-7}$, respectively. The clumps formed in the fragmented
shell move with velocities that are at least twice as large as the escape

the Jeans mass. We conclude that the clumps are pressure supported. A supernova
explosion with energy $10^{53}$ ergs destructs our model protogalaxy. The
clumps formed in the fragmented shell are pressure supported. We conclude that
protogalaxies with total mass $\sim 10^{7} M_\odot$ are unlikely to form stars

fractional Gaussian noise term representing the branching of an avalanche into
small active clusters, and a drift term reflecting the tendency for small
avalanches to grow and large avalanches to be constricted by the finite system
size. If one defines avalanching to take place when the toppling activity
exceeds a certain threshold the stochastic model allows us to compute the
avalanche exponents in the continum limit as functions of the Hurst exponent of
the noise. The results are found to agree well with numerical simulations in
the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld and Zhang sandpile models. The stochastic model also
provides a method for computing the probability density functions of the

partitions the tasks into groups so that the tasks in each group are allocated
independently of the other groups. Tasks in a group of size at least two are

  A direct consequence of this approach is that the approximation ratio of

for two players, VCG is the unique algorithm with optimal approximation 2.
  This characterization provides some support that any decisive truthful

mechanism which is triggered by the filling of the sigma-star antibonding
molecular orbital and is characterised by a sudden release of a large amount of
kinetic energy. This released energy provides a driving force for metal/oxygen
place-exchange processes which are responsible for the onset of oxide formation
at virtually 0 K and at oxygen coverages well below 1 monolayer (ML). Further
simulations of the oxidation reactions reveal that a disordered ultrathin oxide
forms on Al(111), whereas a rather ordered structure develops on TiN(001)
following a selective oxidation process which leaves clusters of Ti vacancies
in the TiN lattice underneath the oxide layer.

include an overview of the theory of refractivity, and the influence of

to cause a loss of Strehl only at the shortest wavelengths (L-band). A more
likely source of error is the difference in wavelengths at which the wavefront
is sensed and corrected, leading to pointing offsets between wavefront sensor
and science instrument that evolve with time over a long exposure. Infrared
radiation is also subject to additional turbulence caused by the presence of
water vapour in the atmosphere not seen by visible wavefront sensors, whose
effect is poorly understood. We make use of information obtained at radio
wavelengths to make a first-order estimate of its effect on the performance of
a mid-IR ground-based instrument. The calculations in this paper are performed

models designed for estimating the main-sequence age and a measure of the

with appropriate modification the procedure could be applied to other stars. We
have found that, as has been anticipated, a separation of the contributions to
the seismic frequencies arising from the relatively smooth, glitch-free,
background structure of the star and from glitches produced by helium
ionization and the abrupt gradient change at the base of the convection zone
renders the procedure more robust than earlier calibrations that fitted only
raw frequencies to glitch-free asymptotics. As in the past, we use asymptotic
analysis to design seismic signatures that are, to the best of our ability,
contaminated as little as possible by those uncertain properties of the star
that are not directly associated with age and chemical composition. The
calibration itself, however, employs only numerically computed
eigenfrequencies. It is based on a linear perturbation from a reference model.
Two reference models have been used, one somewhat younger, the other somewhat
older than the Sun. The two calibrations, which use BiSON data, are
more-or-less consistent, and yield a main-sequence age $t_\odot=4.68\pm0.02
$Gy, coupled with a formal initial heavy-element abundance $Z=0.0169\pm0.0005$.

be taken with a pinch of salt.

detecting non-terminating atomic queries with respect to binary CLP rules,
which strictly generalizes our previous works on this subject. We give a

its infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,
deformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size
precursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear
properties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for
low lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model
serves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of
QPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from
lattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of
the present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase
transitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT
phenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific
dynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to
describe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter
regions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited
states, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the
system. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many
directions: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering
odd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by
including other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing
external rotation. All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in
the interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental
understanding of the QPT phenomenon.

(averages of Q^m) are much smaller for the GUE than for uncorrelated random
(Poisson-distributed) zeros. For the Poisson case, the large-N limit of P(Q)
can be expressed as an integral with infinitely many poles, whose accumulation,
requiring regularization with the Lerch transcendent, generates the singularity
at Q=1, while the large-Q decay is determined by the pole closest to the

the interaction of light with laser-driven 3-level Lambda-type atoms and are
the basis of phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT),
ultra-slow and stored light. They have long intrinsic lifetimes and in a
stationary set-up with two counterpropagating control fields of equal intensity
have a 3D quadratic dispersion profile with variable effective mass. Since DSPs
are bosons they can undergo a Bose-Einstein condensation at a critical
temperature which can be many orders of magnitude larger than that of atoms. We
show that thermalization of polaritons can occur via elastic collisions
mediated by a resonantly enhanced optical Kerr nonlinearity on a time scale
short compared to the decay time. Finally condensation can be observed by
turning stationary into propagating polaritons and monitoring the emitted
light.

peculiar phenomena: varying line profiles, photometric changes, and X-ray
overluminosity are only a few of their characteristics. Here we review their
physical properties, to facilitate comparisons among the Galactic members of
this class. As one of them has been proposed to resemble the magnetic oblique
rotator Theta Ori C, though with a longer period, this latter object is also
included in our study to illuminate its similarities and differences with the
Of?p category.

relativistic particles with photons and matter in the cluster of galaxies Abell
3376. The presence of relativistic particles is inferred from the recently
found radio relics in this cluster, being one of the most prominent examples of
double opposite, giant ringlike radio structures. Assuming that diffusive shock
acceleration takes place in the cluster regions where radio relics are
observed, we calculate the spectral energy distribution resulting from the most
relevant non-thermal processes, which are synchrotron radiation, inverse
Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, and inelastic proton-proton
collisions. In the context of our model, the major radiative component at high
energies is inverse Compton scattering, which could reach luminosities L ~
9x10^{41} erg/s in the energy range between ~ 1 MeV and 10 TeV. Hadronic
interactions would yield a minor contribution to the overall non-thermal
emission, but would dominate at ultra-high energies. The cluster Abell 3376
might be detectable at gamma-rays by HESS, GLAST satellite and future planned
Cherenkov arrays.

with support in B, and proved that it is equivalent to the category of flat
objects in the functor category (B^{op},Ab). In this paper, we study the
category (Mod-R)^B of modules with cosupport in B. We show that (Mod-R)^B is
equivalent to the category of injective objects in (B,Ab), and thus recover a
classical result by Jensen-Lenzing on pure injective modules. Works of
Angeleri-Hugel, Enochs, Krause, Rada, and Saorin make it easy to discuss
covering and enveloping properties of (Mod-R)^B, and furthermore we compare the
naturally associated notions of B-coherence and B-noetherianness. Finally, we
prove a number of stability results for lim(B) and (Mod-R)^B. Our applications
include a generalization of a result by Gruson-Jensen and Enochs on pure
injective envelopes of flat modules.

laser, to the ion's vibrational motion. The post-interaction electronic state
can be read out with high efficiency, giving a stochastic measurement record
whose classical correlations reflect the quantum correlations of the ions'

projective holomorphic symplectic resolution. Namikawa proved that the
Kuranishi deformation spaces Def(X) and Def(Y) are both smooth, of the same
dimension, and p induces a finite branched cover f from Def(X) to Def(Y). We
prove that f is Galois. We proceed to calculate the Galois group G, when X is
simply connected, and its holomorphic symplectic structure is unique, up to a
scalar factor. The singularity of Y is generically of ADE-type, along every
codimension 2 irreducible component B of the singular locus, by Namikawa's
work. The modular Galois group G is the product of Weyl groups of finite type,
indexed by such irreducible components B. Each Weyl group factor W_B is that of
a Dynkin diagram, obtained as a quotient of the Dynkin diagram of the
singularity-type of B, by a group of Dynkin diagram automorphisms.
  Finally we consider generalizations of the above set-up, where Y is affine
symplectic, or a Calabi-Yau threefold with a curve of ADE-singularities. We
prove that the morphism f from Def(X) to Def(Y) is a Galois cover of its image.
This explains the analogy between the above results and related work of
Nakajima, on quiver varieties, and of Szendroi on enhanced gauge symmetries for
Calabi-Yau threefolds.

is to obtain the spatial profile of the external bias potential across the
system, and how this would change in the presence of electron-electron
interactions. We have also studied different kinds of insulators in the
presence of the spatially varying external bias, and have explicitly shown that
a two sublattice structure, caused either by a lattice distortion, or by the
presence of substituents with strong dipolar nature, can result in negative
differential resistance (NDR) in the transport characteristics. We also find
this to be true in case of correlated insulators. Additionally, we have shown
clear NDR behavior in a correlated double quantum dot by tuning the
electron-electron interaction strength in the system.

Lower and upper bounds are provided for the expected maximal value of the
random walk until it experiences a given drawdown d. These bounds, related to
the Calmar ratio in Finance, are of the form (exp{alpha d}-1)/alpha and (K
exp{alpha d}-1)/alpha for some K>1, in terms of the adjustment coefficient
alpha (E[exp{-alpha X}]=1) of the insurance risk literature. Its inverse
1/alpha has been recently derived by Aumann and Serrano as an index of
riskiness of the random variable X. This article also complements the Lundberg
exponential stochastic upper bound and the Cramer-Lundberg approximation for
the expected minimum of the random walk, with an exponential stochastic lower
bound. The tail probability bounds are of the form C exp{-alpha x} and
exp{-alpha x} respectively, for some 1/K < C < 1. Our treatment of the problem
involves Skorokhod embeddings of random walks in Martingales, especially via
the Azema-Yor and Dubins stopping times, adapted from standard Brownian Motion
to exponential Martingales.
