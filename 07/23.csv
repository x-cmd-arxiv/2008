simulations of mergers between galaxies with central supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) to investigate the formation of SMBH binaries in galactic nuclei. We
demonstrate that strong gas inflows produce nuclear disks at the centers of
merger remnants whose properties depend sensitively on the details of gas
thermodynamics. In numerical simulations with parsec-scale spatial resolution
in the gas component and an effective equation of state appropriate for a
starburst galaxy, we show that a SMBH binary forms very rapidly, less than a
million years after the merger of the two galaxies. Binary formation is
significantly suppressed in the presence of a strong heating source such as
radiative feedback by the accreting SMBHs. We also present preliminary results
of numerical simulations with ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.1 pc in the
gas component. These simulations resolve the internal structure of the
resulting nuclear disk down to parsec scales and demonstrate the formation of a
central massive object (~ 10^8 Mo) by efficient angular momentum transport.
This is the first time that a radial gas inflow is shown to extend to parsec
scales as a result of the dynamics and hydrodynamics involved in a galaxy
merger, and has important implications for the fueling of SMBHs. Due to the
rapid formation of the central clump, the density of the nuclear disk decreases
significantly in its outer region, reducing dramatically the effect of
dynamical friction and leading to the stalling of the two SMBHs at a separation
of ~1 pc. We discuss how the orbital decay of the black holes might continue in
a more realistic model which incorporates star formation and the multi-phase
nature of the ISM.

made an interesting remark on Bell's theorem. Nelson analysed the latter in the

hidden variable theory fulfils certain conditions, the inequality of Bell can
be violated. Moreover, Nelson was able to prove that this may happen without
any instantaneous communication between the two spatially separated measurement
stations. Since Nelson's article got almost overlooked by physicists, we try to
review his comments on Bell's theorem. We argue that a modification of
stochastic mechanics published recently by Fritsche and Haugk can be extended
to a theory which fulfils the requirements of Nelson's analysis. The article
proceeds to derive the quantum mechanical formalism of spinning particles and
the Pauli equation from this version of stochastic mechanics. Then, we
investigate Bohm's version of the EPR experiment. Additionally, other setups,
like entanglement swapping or time and position correlations, are shortly
explained from the viewpoint of our local hidden-variable model. Finally, we
mention that this theory could perhaps be relativistically extended.

resolution of 1 night and with a maximum angular resolution of 1
milliarcsecond, making best use of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
capabilities. To fulfill the scientific goals (see Garcia et. al.), the system
requirements are: a) combining 4 to 6 beams; b) working in spectral bands J, H
and K; c) spectral resolution from R= 100 to 12000; and d) internal fringe
tracking on-axis, or off-axis when associated to the PRIMA dual-beam facility.
The concept of VSI consists on 6 sub-systems: a common path distributing the
light between the fringe tracker and the scientific instrument, the fringe
tracker ensuring the co-phasing of the array, the scientific instrument
delivering the interferometric observables and a calibration tool providing
sources for internal alignment and interferometric calibrations. The two
remaining sub-systems are the control system and the observation support
software dedicated to the reduction of the interferometric data. This paper
presents the global concept of VSI science path including the common path, the
scientific instrument and the calibration tool. The scientific combination
using a set of integrated optics multi-way beam combiners to provide
high-stability visibility and closure phase measurements are also described.
Finally we will address the performance budget of the global VSI instrument.
The fringe tracker and scientific spectrograph will be shortly described.

which were found to be active during a monitoring campaign of the Galactic
center carried out in 2006 and 2007 using the X-ray telescope aboard the Swift
satellite. This campaign detected new outbursts of five known X-ray transients
and discovered two new systems. Their 2-10 keV peak luminosities range from
1E34 to 6E36 erg/s. Two of the sources discussed in this paper are confirmed
neutron star systems (AX J1745.6-2901 and GRS 1741-2853), while the five others
have an unknown nature. We discuss the characteristics of the observed
outbursts and the duty cycles of the various systems. Several of the detected
transients seem to undergo enhanced X-ray activity with levels intermediate
between quiescence and full outburst. We discuss the possibility that the
subluminous appearance of the eclipsing X-ray burster AX J1745.6-2901 is due to
line-of-sight effects. We detected two type-I X-ray bursts with a duration of
50-60 seconds from AX J1745.6-2901, which we discuss in view of the bursting
behavior of low-luminosity X-ray transients. Assuming that we are dealing with
accreting neutron stars and black holes, we estimate the time-average accretion
rate, Mdot, of the transients, which is an important input parameter for binary
evolution models that attempt to explain the nature of subluminous X-ray
transients. Our estimates lie in the range of 3E-13 Msun/yr < Mdot < 1E-10
Msun/yr, if the systems are neutron star X-ray binaries and between 4E-14
Msun/yr < Mdot < 2E-11 Msun/yr for a scenario where the accreting object is a
black hole. Some of the systems have such low estimated mass-accretion rates
that they possibly pose a challenge for binary evolution models.

cathode. As the applied bias exceeds a threshold, a transition in radial
particle confinement is observed, evidenced by a dramatic steepening in the
density profile, similar to the L- to H-mode transition in toroidal confinement
devices. The threshold behavior and dynamic behavior of radial transport is
related to flow penetration and the degree of spatial overlap between the flow
shear and density gradient profiles. An investigation of the changes in
turbulence and turbulent particle transport associated with the confinement
transition is presented. Two-dimensional cross-correlation measurements show
that the spatial coherence of edge turbulence in LAPD changes significantly
with biasing. The azimuthal correlation in the turbulence increases
dramatically, while the radial correlation length is little altered. Turbulent
amplitude is reduced at the transition, particularly in electric field
fluctuations, but the dominant change observed is in the cross-phase between

order phase transitions known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) to
transitions where the change of phase occurs not in time, but in space. This
can be due to a time-independent spatial variation of a field that imposes a
phase with one symmetry to the left of where it attains critical value, while
allowing spontaneous symmetry breaking to the right of that critical
borderline. Topological defects need not form in such a situation. We show,
however, that the size, in space, of the ``scar'' over which the order
parameter adjusts as it ``bends'' interpolating between the phases with
different symmetry follows from a KZM - like approach. As we illustrate on the
example of a transverse quantum Ising model, in quantum phase transitions this
spatial scale -- the size of the scar -- is directly reflected in the energy
spectrum of the system: In particular, it determines the size of the energy
gap.

the action of the left normed multi-linear Lie bracketing $l_{n}$ of ${\mathcal

equals to a signed binomial coefficient when $|I| = 1$ and allows us to obtain
a sufficient condition on $n$ and $I$ in order that $w$ lies in ${\mathcal

the role of the dissipation induced by those degrees of freedom, showing that,

binet, our algorithm outputs a nonsingular matrix B and a matrix N such that [B
N] is the node-edge incidence matrix of a bidirected graph (of full row rank)
and A=B^{-1} N.
  Furthermore, we provide some results about Camion bases. For a matrix M of
size n times m', we present a new characterization of Camion bases of M,
whenever M is the node-edge incidence matrix of a connected digraph (with one
row removed). Then, a general characterization of Camion bases as well as a
recognition procedure which runs in O(n^2m') are given. An algorithm which
finds a Camion basis is also presented. For totally unimodular matrices, it is
proven to run in time O((nm)^2) where m=m'-n.
  The last result concerns specific network matrices. We give a
characterization of nonnegative {r,s}-noncorelated network matrices, where r

seem to exhibit two main types of light curve morphologies, (a) the classical
Fast-Rise and Exponential-Decay (FRED) type outburst seen in many soft X-ray
transients and (b) the Low-Intensity State (LIS) where the
optical-to-soft-X-ray flux ratio is much higher than that seen during a FRED.
Thus there is no single correlation between the optical (R-band) and soft X-ray
(1.5-12 keV, as seen by the ASM onboard RXTE) fluxes even within the hard state
for Aquila X-1, suggesting that LISs and FREDs have fundamentally different
accretion flow properties. Time evolution of the OIR fluxes during the major
LIS and FRED outbursts is compatible with thermal heating of the irradiated
outer accretion disk. No signature of X-ray spectral state changes or any
compact jet are seen in the OIR, showing that the OIR color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) can be used as a diagnostic tool to separate thermal and non-thermal
radiation from X-ray binaries where orbital and physical parameters of the
system are reasonably well known. We suggest that the LIS may be caused by
truncation of the inner disk in a relatively high mass accretion state,
possibly due to matter being diverted into a weak outflow.

Combining our targets with two similar, long-slit studies to increase sample

power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We calculate the microscopic viscosity and
resistivity of plasma in these discs, and discuss the implications for their
global structure and evolution. In the neutrino-cooled innermost regions, the
viscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons, while the
resistivity is modified from the Spitzer value due to the effects of both
relativity and degeneracy. The plasma behaves as an almost ideal MHD fluid.
Among the non-ideal MHD effects the Hall term is relatively the most important,
while the magnetic Prandtl number, Pr (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity),
is typically larger than unity: 10 < Pr < 6000. The outer radiatively
inefficient regions also display high Pr. Numerical simulations of the
magneto-rotational instability indicate that the saturation level and angular
momentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high Pr. If this
behaviour persists in the presence of a strong Hall effect we would expect that
hyper-accreting discs should be strongly magnetised and highly variable. The
expulsion of magnetic field that cannot be dissipated at small scales may also
favour a magnetic outflow. We note the similaries between the Prandtl number in
hyper-accreting discs and X-ray binary discs, which suggests that a comparison
between late-time activity in GRBs and X-ray binary accretion states may be
fruitful. Our results imply that the behavior of high Prandtl number MHD flows
needs to be considered in studies of hyper-accreting discs.

the first connection with a supernova explosion (SN 1998bw). The host has a
sufficient size to allow detailed resolved spectroscopy of individual HII
regions and to look for regions with special properties close to the the GRB

surface brightness part of the host including the HII region where the
supernova and GRB occurred. The star formation rate, reddening, equivalent
width and stellar mass in the GRB region is similar to other HII regions in the
host. Extreme values arise in the only region that shows emission lines from
Wolf-Rayet stars; a region that lies 800 pc in projection from the GRB site.
Strong emission line diagnostics of all HII regions imply oxygen abundances
between 0.3 and 0.8 solar with the lowest values arising in the WR and GRB

identified a relationship between the locations of the density corrugations and
small-amplitude (~5 km/s) velocity undulations in the HI rotation curve. We are
able to exclude several possible mechanisms for the origin of the observed

of ferromagnet/semiconductor/normal metal tunnel junctions are investigated.
Analytical expressions for the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR)
are derived within an approximation in which the dependence of the
magnetoresistance on the magnetization orientation in the ferromagnet
originates from the interference between Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit couplings that appear at junction interfaces and in the tunneling
region. We also investigate the transport properties of
ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet tunnel junctions and show that in such
structures the spin-orbit interaction leads not only to the TAMR effect but
also to the anisotropy of the conventional tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR).
The resulting anisotropic tunneling magnetoresistance (ATMR) depends on the
absolute magnetization directions in the ferromagnets. Within the proposed
model, depending on the magnetization directions in the ferromagnets, the
interplay of Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings produces
differences between the rates of transmitted and reflected spins at the
ferromagnet/seminconductor interfaces, which results in an anisotropic local
density of states at the Fermi surface and in the TAMR and ATMR effects. Model
calculations for Fe/GaAs/Fe tunnel junctions are presented. Furthermore, based
on rather general symmetry considerations, we deduce the form of the
magnetoresistance dependence on the absolute orientations of the magnetizations
in the ferromagnets.

0.037) show that the ordering moment and the Neel temperature are continuously
suppressed as x approaches 0.037, a proposed Quantum Critical Point (QCP). The
wave vector Q of the spin density wave (SDW) becomes more incommensurate as x
increases in accordance with the two band model. At xc=0.037 we have found
temperature dependent, resolution limited elastic scattering at 4
incommensurate wave vectors Q=(1+/-delta_1,2, 0, 0)*2pi/a, which correspond to
2 SDWs with Neel temperatures of 19 K and 300 K. Our neutron diffraction
measurements indicate that the electronic structure of Cr is robust, and that
tuning Cr to its QCP results not in the suppression of antiferromagnetism, but
instead enables new spin ordering due to novel nesting of the Fermi surface of
Cr.

disk-wide active star formation, is particularly well-suited for studying the
disk/halo interaction on sub-galactic scales. We detect 27 discrete X-ray
sources within the $D_{25}$ region of the galaxy, including an ultra-luminous
source with a 0.3-7 keV luminosity of $\sim7\times10^{40}\rm ergs s^{-1}$. The
source-removed diffuse X-ray emission shows several prominent extraplanar
features, including a $\sim10\rm kpc$ diameter ``shell-like'' feature and a
``blob'' reaching a projected distance of $\sim25\rm kpc$ from the galactic
disk. The bulk of the X-ray emission in the halo has a scale height of
$\sim$1.5 kpc and can be characterized by a two-temperature optically thin
thermal plasma with temperatures of $\sim$ 0.2 and 0.6 keV and a total 0.3-2
keV luminosity of $\sim3.5\times10^{39}\rm ergs s^{-1}$. The high-resolution,
multi-wavelength data reveal the presence of several extraplanar features
around the disk, which appear to be associated with the in-disk star formation.
We suggest that hot gas produced with different levels of mass loading can have
different temperatures, which may explain the characteristic temperatures of
hot gas in the halo. We have obtained a sub-galactic scale X-ray-intensity-star
formation relation, which is consistent with the integrated version in other
star forming galaxies.

number of $k$-dimensional faces of the random $n$-dimensional zonotope $A\h$
obeys the formula $E f_k(A\h) /f_k(\h) = 1-P_{N-n,N-k}$, where $P_{N-n,N-k}$ is
a fair-coin-tossing probability. The formula applies, for example, where the
columns of $A$ are drawn i.i.d. from an absolutely continuous symmetric
distribution. The formula exploits Wendel's Theorem\cite{We62}.
  Let $\po$ denote the positive orthant; the expected number of $k$-faces of
the random cone$A \po$ obeys $ {\cal E} f_k(A\po) /f_k(\po) = 1 - P_{N-n,N-k}$.
The formula applies to numerous matrix ensembles, including those with iid
random columns from an absolutely continuous, centrally symmetric distribution.
There is an asymptotically sharp threshold in the behavior of face counts of
the projected hypercube; thresholds known for projecting the simplex and the
cross-polytope, occur at very different locations. We briefly consider face
counts of the projected orthant when $A$ does not have mean zero; these do
behave similarly to those for the projected simplex. We consider non-random
projectors of the orthant; the 'best possible' $A$ is the one associated with
the first $n$ rows of the Fourier matrix.
  These geometric face-counting results have implications for signal
processing, information theory, inverse problems, and optimization. Most of
these flow in some way from the fact that face counting is related to
conditions for uniqueness of solutions of underdetermined systems of linear
equations.

attention to the the second pixelization because it might be a potential source
of a systematic noise in a weak lensing analysis. In particular, it is found
that resampling with rotation induces artificial ellipticities in object shapes
having a periodic concentric-circle-shaped pattern. Our major findings are as
follows. (1) Root-mean-square (RMS) of artificial ellipticities in object
shapes induced by the first pixelization effect can be as large as RMS > 10^-2
if a characteristic size of objects (e.g., the FWHM) is smaller than twice of
the pixel size. While for larger objects, it quickly becomes very small (RMS <
10^-5). (2) The amplitude of the shape deformation induced by the second
pixelization effect depends on the object size. It also depends strongly on an
interpolation scheme adopted to carry out resampling and on the grid size of
the output pixels. The RMS of ellipticities in object shapes induced by the
second pixelization effect can be suppressed to well below 10^{-2} if one
adopts a proper interpolation scheme (implemented in popular image processing
softwares). We also discuss an impact of the pixelization effects on a weak

muscles fatigue on postural control during quiet standing under normal, altered
and improved vestibular and neck somatosensory conditions. To address this
objective, young male university students were asked to stand upright as still
as possible with their eyes closed in two conditions of No Fatigue and Fatigue
of the plantar-flexor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n=15), the postural task was
executed in two Neutral head and Head tilted backward postures, recognized to
degrade vestibular and neck somatosensory information. In Experiment 2 (n=15),
the postural task was executed in two conditions of No tactile and Tactile
stimulation of the neck provided by the application of strips of adhesive
bandage to the skin over and around the neck. Centre of foot pressure
displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results showed that (1) the
Fatigue condition yielded increased CoP displacements relative to the No
Fatigue condition (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) this destabilizing
effect was more accentuated in the Head tilted backward posture than Neutral
head posture (Experiment 1) and (3) this destabilizing effect was less
accentuated in the condition of Tactile stimulation than that of No tactile
stimulation of the neck (Experiment 2). In the context of the multisensory
control of balance, these results suggest an increased reliance on vestibular
and neck somatosensory information for controlling posture during quiet
standing in condition of altered ankle neuromuscular function.

Bose condensate of alkali atoms. Introducing an optical lattice depletes this
coherence. Consequently, novel vortex physics may emerge in an experiment on a
harmonically trapped gas in the presence of a rotating optical lattice. The
most dramatic effects would occur in proximity to the Mott state, an
interaction dominated insulator with a fixed integer number of particles per
site. We model such a rotating gas, showing that the lattice-induced spatial
profile of the superfluid density drives a gross rearrangement of vortices. For
example, instead of the uniform vortex lattices commonly seen in experiments,
we find parameters for which the vortices all sit at a fixed distance from the
center of the trap, forming a ring. Similarly, they can coalesce at the center,
forming a giant vortex. We find that the properties of this system are
hysteretic, even far from the Mott state. We explain this hysteresis in terms
of vortex pinning, commensurability between vortex density and pinning site
density, and energy barriers against changing the number of vortices. Finally,
we model time-of-flight expansion, demonstrating the experimental observability
of our predictions.

due to a massive scalar field subject to periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann

energy in the interior region and the exterior region separated by the piston.
It is shown that the divergent term of the Casimir force acting on the piston
due to the interior region cancels with that due to the exterior region, thus
render a finite well-defined Casimir force acting on the piston. Explicit
expressions for the total Casimir force acting on the piston is derived, which
show that the Casimir force is always attractive for all the different boundary
conditions considered. As a function of a -- the distance from the piston to
the opposite wall, it is found that the magnitude of the Casimir force behaves
like $1/a^4$ when $a\to 0^+$ and decays exponentially when $a\to \infty$.
Moreover, the magnitude of the Casimir force is always a decreasing function of
a. On the other hand, passing from massless to massive, we find that the effect
of the mass is insignificant when a is small, but the magnitude of the force is
decreased for large a in the massive case.

profile, hence decreasing the gas-dynamical drag. This leads the newly formed
binary to stall at a separation of ~5 pc. In the early phases of the sinking,
black holes lose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity if they co-rotate
with the disc, as rotation of the gaseous background promotes circularization
of the black hole orbits. Circularization is efficient until the black holes
bind in a binary, though in the latest stages of the simulations a residual
eccentricity > 0.1 is still present. Black holes are treated as sink particles,
allowing for gas accretion. We find that accretion strongly depends on the

IRDCs. Previous analysis of sub-millimeter cores in the cloud MSXDC
G048.65-00.29 (G48.65) indicates embedded star formation activity. To
characterize this activity in detail, mid-infrared photometry (3-30 micron) has
been obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. This paper analyzes the point
sources seen in the 24 micron band, combined with counterparts or upper limits
at shorter and longer wavelengths. Data points in wavelength bands ranging from
1 up to 850 micron are used to compare each 24 micron source to a set of
Spectral Energy Distributions of Young Stellar Object (YSO) models. By
assessing the models that fit the data, an attempt is made to identify YSOs as
such and determine their evolutionary stages and stellar masses. A total of 17
sources are investigated, 13 of which are classified as YSOs, primarily - but
not exclusively - in an early embedded phase of star formation. The modeled
masses of the central stellar objects range from sub-solar to ~8 solar masses.
Every YSO is at less than 1 pc projected distance from its nearest YSO
neighbor. We conclude that IRDC G48.65 is a region of active star formation. We
find YSOs in various evolutionary phases, indicating that the star formation in
this cloud is not an instantaneous process. The inferred masses of the central
objects suggest that this IRDC hosts only low to intermediate mass YSOs and
none with masses exceeding ~8 solar masses.

correlated half-filled nanorings and the one-hole and two-hole--one-particle
processes possible in the noninteracting case. Similar to the case of optical
absorption, numerous avoided crossings (anticrossings) are present in the
ionization spectra, which often involve more than two states. The present
results demonstrate that ionization could be a useful tool to study electron
correlations in metallic QD--nanoarrays, providing information that is
complementary to optical absorption.

basically due to fermionic excitations, but with a temperature dependence of
the specific heat coefficient controlled by fluctuations of a gauge field

very general analytical expression. Using typical measurements of real and
imaginary resistivity as a function of the applied field, we show that, even
for single-frequency measurements, it is always possible to obtain (a)
estimates of viscous drag coefficient and pinning constant with well-defined
upper and lower bounds and (b) quantitative information about thermal creep. It
turns out that neglecting thermal creep, in particular and counterintuitively
at low temperatures, might result in a severe overestimation of the viscous

determination of the pinning constant. The present results might lead to a
reconsideration of several estimates of the vortex parameters.

in the system according to a random walk scheme to achieve their goal. To study
their efficiency and compare it to one of the deterministic solutions, one is
led to compute certain quantities, namely the hitting times and the cover time.
Until now, only bounds on these quantities were defined. First, this paper
presents two generalizations of the notions of hitting and cover times to
weighted graphs. Indeed, the properties of random walks on symmetrically
weighted graphs provide interesting results on random walk based distributed
algorithms, such as local load balancing. Both of these generalization are
proposed to precisely represent the behaviour of these algorithms, and to take
into account what the weights represent. Then, we propose an algorithm to
compute the n^2 hitting times on a weighted graph of n vertices, which we
improve to obtain a O(n^3) complexity. This complexity is the lowest up to now.
This algorithm computes both of the generalizations that we propose for the
hitting times on a weighted graph. Finally, we provide the first algorithm to
compute the cover time (in both senses) of a graph. We improve it to achieve a
complexity of O(n^3 2^n). The algorithms that we present are all robust to a
topological change in a limited number of edges. This property allows us to use
them on dynamic graphs.

travels between two sites along the DNA by three-dimensional diffusion, and

masking affects high-order moments only below $\ell < 200$. Each domain
(Gaussian and non-Gaussian) spans 2 decades in angular scale. This map is
therefore an ideal tool for testing map-making algorithms on the sphere. As a
first step in addressing the full map reconstruction problem, we have
benchmarked in this paper two denoising methods: 1) Wiener filtering applied to
the Spherical Harmonics decomposition of the map and 2) a new method, called
MRLens, based on the modification of the Maximum Entropy Method on a Wavelet
decomposition. While the latter is optimal on large spatial scales, where the
signal is Gaussian, MRLens outperforms the Wiener method on small spatial
scales, where the signal is highly non-Gaussian. The simulated full-sky
convergence map is freely available to the community to help the development of
new map-making algorithms dedicated to the next generation of weak-lensing
surveys.

of IR QSOs are compared with those of optically-selected Palomar-Green QSOs (PG

features from ~ 5 to 30um, including the spectral slopes, 6.2um PAH emission
strengths and [NeII] 12.81um luminosities of IR QSOs, differ from those of PG
QSOs. In contrast, IR QSOs and ULIRGs have comparable PAH and [NeII]
luminosities. These results are consistent with IR QSOs being at a transitional
stage from ULIRGs to classical QSOs. We also find that the colour index
alpha(30, 15) is a good indicator of the relative contribution of starbursts to
AGNs for all QSOs. Correlations between the [NeII] 12.81um and PAH 6.2um
luminosities and those between the [NeII], PAH with 60um luminosities for
ULIRGs and IR QSOs indicate that both [NeII] and PAH luminosities are
approximate star formation rate indicators for IR QSOs and starburst-dominated
galaxies; the scatters are, however, quite large (~ 0.7 to 0.8 dex). Finally
the correlation between the EW(PAH 6.2um) and outflow velocities suggests that
star formation activities are suppressed by feedback from AGNs and/or
supernovae.

whether a novel method is capable of providing these data. We obtained spectro
astrometry around the Pa beta line of two bright Be stars, alpha Col and zeta
Tau, to search for disk signatures. The data, with a pixel to pixel precision
of the centroid position of 0.3..0.4 milliarcsecond is the most accurate such

these are readily identified as they were non-repeatable in our redundant

spurious detections. The data are compared with simple model simulations of the
spectro astrometric signatures due to rotating disks around Be stars. The upper
limits we find for the disk radii correspond to disk sizes of a few dozen
stellar radii if they rotate Keplerian. This is very close to observationally
measured and theoretically expected disk sizes, and this paper therefore
demonstrates that spectro-astrometry, of which we present the first such

using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer to study their gas and dynamical
properties. We estimate the molecular gas mass in each of the three SFRGs
(8.3x10^{9} M_odot, <5.6x10^{9} M_odot and 15.4x10^{9} M_odot, respectively)
and, in the case of RG163655, a dynamical mass by measurement of the width of
the CO(3-2) line (8x10^{10} csc^2i M_odot). While these gas masses are
substantial, on average they are 4x lower than submm-selected galaxies (SMGs).
Radio-inferred star formation rates (<SFR_radio>=970 M_odot\yr) suggest much
higher star-formation efficiencies than are found for SMGs, and shorter gas
depletion time scales (~11 Myr), much shorter than the time required to form
their current stellar masses (~160 Myr; ~10^{11} M_odot). By contrast, SFRs may
be overestimated by factors of a few, bringing the efficiencies in line with
those typically measured for other ultraluminous star-forming galaxies and
suggesting SFRGs are more like ultraviolet- (UV-)selected star-forming galaxies
with enhanced radio emission. A tentative detection of \rga at 350um suggests
hotter dust temperatures -- and thus similar gas-to-dust mass fractions -- as
the SMGs. We conclude that SFRGs' radio luminosities are larger than would
naturally scale from local ULIRGs given their gas masses or gas fractions.

momentum ground state energies are obtained that are systematically lower than

one fifth of the correlation energy due to long-range correlations are

the Faraday-Maxwell electromagnetism theory. This theory explained the main
physical laws of light propagation in space-time and posed new questions
concerning the nature of vacuum. Nonetheless, almost all attempts aiming to
unveil the real state of art of the vacuum problem appeared to be unsuccessful
in spite of new ideas suggested by Mach, Lorentz, Poincare, Einstein and some
others physicists. Moreover, the non-usual way of treating the space-time
devised by Einstein, in reality, favored to eclipsing both its nature and the
related physical vacuum origin problems \cite{Fe,Ga,Ma,TW,Ba,BP}, reducing them
to some physically unmotivated formal mathematical principles and recipes,
combined in the well known special relativity theory (SRT). The SRT appeared to
be adapted to the only inertial reference systems and faced with hard problems
of the electromagnetic Lorentz forces explanation and relationships between
inertial and gravity forces. The latter was artificially ""dissolved"" by means
of the well known ""equivalence"" principle owing to which the ""inertial"" mass of
a material object was postulated to coincide with its ""gravity"" mass.
  In work we try to unveil some nontrivial aspects of the real space-time and
vacuum origin problems to derive from the natural field theory principles all
of the well known Maxwell electromagnetism and relativity theories results, to
show their relative or only visible coincidence with real physical phenomena
and to feature new perspectives facing the modern fundamental physics.

information of certain physical quantities in the boundary CFT. More
specifically we look at singular correlators and entanglement entropy in the
CFT to provide information of null and spacelike geodesics repectively in the
bulk. We show that static spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes
which do not admit null circular orbits can be fully recovered, and that any
spacetime can be recovered up to the local maximum of the potential. We provide
analytical and numerical examples to verify the methods used.

play an important role in diagonalising the two-point functions of multi-matrix
operators. Generalised Casimirs constructed from the iterated commutator action
of these enhanced symmetries resolve all the multiplicity labels of the bases
of matrix operators which diagonalise the two-point function. For the case of U
(N) gauge theory with a single complex matrix in the adjoint of the gauge group
we have a U(N)^{\times 4} global symmetry of the scaling operator at zero
coupling. Different choices of commuting sets of Casimirs, for the case of a
complex matrix, lead to the restricted Schur basis previously studied in
connection with string excitations of giant gravitons and the Brauer basis
studied in connection with brane-anti-brane systems. More generally these
remarks can be extended to the diagonalisation for any global symmetry group G.
Schur-Weyl duality plays a central role in connecting the enhanced symmetries
and the diagonal bases.

variations in the laws of physics, this paper explores the parameter space of
fundamental constants that allows for the existence of stars. To make this
problem tractable, we develop a semi-analytical stellar structure model that
allows for physical understanding of these stars with unconventional
parameters, as well as a means to survey the relevant parameter space. In this
work, the most important quantities that determine stellar properties -- and
are allowed to vary -- are the gravitational constant $G$, the fine structure
constant $\alpha$, and a composite parameter $C$ that determines nuclear
reaction rates. Working within this model, we delineate the portion of
parameter space that allows for the existence of stars. Our main finding is
that a sizable fraction of the parameter space (roughly one fourth) provides
the values necessary for stellar objects to operate through sustained nuclear
fusion. As a result, the set of parameters necessary to support stars are not
particularly rare. In addition, we briefly consider the possibility that
unconventional stars (e.g., black holes, dark matter stars) play the role
filled by stars in our universe and constrain the allowed parameter space.

finite field arithmetic in hardware is based on an isomorphism between subrings
and fields. In this paper, we present an unified formulation for multiplication
in cyclotomic rings and cyclotomic fields in that most arithmetic operations
are done on vectors. From this formulation we can generate optimized algorithms
for multiplication. For example, one of the proposed algorithms requires
approximately half the number of coordinate-level multiplications at the
expense of extra coordinate-level additions. Our method is then applied to the
finite fields GF(q^m) to further reduce the number of operations. We then
present optimized algorithms for multiplication in finite fields with type-I
and type-II optimal normal bases.

We make use of recently developed on-shell methods for evaluating coefficients

improving numerical stability. We illustrate the good numerical stability of
this approach by computing six-, seven- and eight-gluon amplitudes in QCD and
comparing against known analytic results.
