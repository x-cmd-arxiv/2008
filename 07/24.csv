combination of the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift and provides
a ""null test"" of dark energy being a cosmological constant. Namely, if the
value of Om(z) is the same at different redshifts, then DE is exactly
cosmological constant. The slope of Om(z) can differentiate between different
models of dark energy even if the value of the matter density is not accurately
known. For DE with an unevolving equation of state, a positive slope of Om(z)
is suggestive of Phantom (w < -1) while a negative slope indicates Quintessence
(w > -1). The second diagnostic, ""acceleration probe""(q-probe), is the mean
value of the deceleration parameter over a small redshift range. It can be used
to determine the cosmological redshift at which the universe began to
accelerate, again without reference to the current value of the matter density.
We apply the ""Om"" and ""q-probe"" diagnostics to the Union data set of type Ia
supernovae combined with recent data from the cosmic microwave background
(WMAP5) and baryon acoustic oscillations.

releases, DR6 and DR7, which sample over 1 Gpc^3/h^3 to z=0.47. The 2-point
correlation function $\xisp$ is estimated as a function of perpendicular
$\sigma$ and line-of-sight $\pi$ (radial) directions. We find a significant
detection of a peak at $r\simeq 110$Mpc/h, which shows as a circular ring in
the $\sigma-\pi$ plane. There is also significant evidence for a peak along the
radial direction whose shape is consistent with its originating from the
recombination-epoch baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). A $\xisp$ model with no
radial BAO peak is disfavored at $3.2\sigma$, whereas a model with no
magnification bias is disfavored at $2\sigma$. The radial data enable, for the
first time, a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ as a function
of redshift. This is independent from earlier BAO measurements which used the
spherically averaged (monopole) correlation to constrain an integral of $H(z)$.
Using the BAO peak position as a standard ruler in the radial direction, we
find: $H(z=0.24)= 79.69 \pm 2.32 (\pm 1.29)$ km/s/Mpc for z=0.15-0.30 and
$H(z=0.43)= 86.45 \pm 3.27 (\pm 1.69)$ km/s/Mpc for $z=0.40-0.47$. The first
error is a model independent statistical estimation and the second accounts for
systematics both in the measurements and in the model. For the full sample,
$z=0.15-0.47$, we find $H(z=0.34)= 83.80 \pm 2.96 (\pm 1.59)$ km/s/Mpc.

reveal large fluxes (>1.3 mJy) in the K_s-band over more than 900 days. While
warm dust can explain the late-time K_s-band emission of SN 2005ip, the nature
of the dust heating source is ambiguous. Shock heating of pre-existing dust by
post-shocked gas is unlikely because the forward shock is moving too slowly to
have traversed the expected dust-free cavity by the time observations first
reveal the K_s emission. While an infrared light echo model correctly predicts
a near-infrared luminosity plateau, heating dust to the observed temperatures
of ~1400-1600 K at a relatively large distance from the supernova (> 10^{18}
cm) requires an extraordinarily high early supernova luminosity (~1 X 10^{11}
L_solar). The evidence instead favors condensing dust in the cool, dense shell
between the forward and reverse shocks. Both the initial dust temperature and
the evolutionary trend towards lower temperatures are consistent with this
scenario. We infer that radiation from the circumstellar interaction heats the
dust. While this paper includes no spectroscopic confirmation, the photometry
is comparable to other SNe that do show spectroscopic evidence for dust
formation. Observations of dust formation in SNe are sparse, so these results
provide a rare opportunity to consider SNe Type IIn as dust sources.

generation of kilopixel CMB polarisation experiments. Years worth of time
ordered data (TOD) from thousands of detectors will need to be compressed into
maps of the T, Q and U Stokes parameters. Fundamental to the science goal of
these experiments, the observation of B-modes, is the ability to control noise
and systematics. In this paper, we consider an alternative to the
maximum-likelihood method, called destriping, where the noise is modelled as a
set of discrete offset functions and then subtracted from the time-stream. We
compare our destriping code (Descart: the DEStriping CARTographer) to a full
maximum-likelihood map-maker, applying them to 200 Monte-Carlo simulations of
time-ordered data from a ground based, partial-sky polarisation modulation
experiment. In these simulations, the noise is dominated by either detector or
atmospheric 1/f noise. Using prior information of the power spectrum of this
noise, we produce destriped maps of T, Q and U which are negligibly different
from optimal. The method does not filter the signal or bias the E or B-mode
power spectra. Depending on the length of the destriping baseline, the method
delivers between 5 and 22 times improvement in computation time over the
maximum-likelihood algorithm. We find that, for the specific case of single
detector maps, it is essential to destripe the atmospheric 1/f in order to
detect B-modes, even though the Q and U signals are modulated by a half-wave
plate spinning at 5-Hz.

examine the rotational properties of twist and turn, and their effect on images
in real and shapelet space. We construct estimators for the new distortion,
taking into account the centroid shift which it generates. We then use these

surrounding gas. Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is
believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output. It is well
known, however, that the most extensively studied disk model -- an optically
thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding
energy -- is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects.
In particular, the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically
from the visible to the near-infrared, but this is not generally seen in the
visible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable. A crucial
difficulty was that, toward the infrared, the disk spectrum starts to be hidden
under strong hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales,
and thus has essentially been impossible to observe. Here we report
observations of polarized light interior to the dust-emiting region that enable
us to uncover this near-infrared disk spectrum in several quasars. The revealed
spectra show that the near-infrared disk spectrum is indeed as blue as
predicted. This indicates that, at least for the outer near-infrared-emitting
radii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately
correct. The model problems at shorter wavelengths should then be directed
toward a better understanding of the inner parts of the revealed disk. The
newly uncovered disk emission at large radii, with more future measurements,
will also shed totally new light on the unanswered critical question of how and
where the disk ends.

distribution can be recovered from the sample. We learn that a fixed number of
top eigenvectors might at the same time contain redundant clustering
information and miss relevant clustering information. We use this insight to
design the data spectroscopic clustering (DaSpec) algorithm that utilizes
properly selected eigenvectors to determine the number of clusters
automatically and to group the data accordingly. Our findings extend the
intuitions underlying existing spectral techniques such as spectral clustering
and Kernel Principal Components Analysis, and provide new understanding into
their usability and modes of failure. Simulation studies and experiments on
real-world data are conducted to show the potential of our algorithm. In
particular, DaSpec is found to handle unbalanced groups and recover clusters of

years. The efficacy of dust-driven mass loss has been queried. Spitzer
observation of AGB stars in Local Group Galaxies show the surprising result
that at low metallicity, AGB mass loss occurs at low luminosity, possibly lower
than in the Galaxy, but only for carbon-rich stars. Oxygen-rich stars in the
Galaxy and in lower metallicity galaxies have similar mass-loss rates only at
high luminosities. To explain this dichotomy, we propose that the superwind has
a dual trigger. The superwind starts either when sufficient excess carbon
builds up for efficient formation of carbonaceous dust (which we propose occurs
when $X_{\rm CO} = \rm (C - O)/ O_\odot = 0.1$), or when the luminosity reaches
a value sufficient for a silicate-dust-driven wind (proposed at $L = 10^4
Z^{-4/3} \rm L_\odot)$. We show that this dual trigger fits the current
observational constraints: the luminosity at which the superwind begins, and
the predominance of carbon superwind star at low metallicity. We use stellar

detailed predictions of the luminosities at which the superwind is triggered

mechanism and pairing symmetry has already revealed a complicated and often
contradictory underlying picture of the structural and magnetic properties.
There is an almost unprecedented sensitivity of the calculated magnetism and
Fermi surface to structural details that prohibits correspondence with
experiment. Furthermore, experimental probes of the order parameter symmetry
are in surprisingly strong disagreement, even considering the relative
immaturity of the field. Here we outline all of the various and seemingly
contradictory evidences, both theoretical and experimental, and show that they
can be rectified if the system is assumed to be highly magnetic with a spin
density wave that is well-defined but with magnetic twin and anti-phase
boundaries that are dynamic on the time-scale of experiments. Under this
assumption, we find that our calculations can accurately reproduce even very
fine details of the structure, and a natural explanation for the temperature
separation of structural and magnetic transitions is provided. Thus, our theory
restores agreement between experiment and theory in crucial areas, making
further cooperative progress possible on both fronts. We believe that
fluctuating magnetic domains will be an essential component of unravelling the

Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out for a half-infinite

role of neutron-proton asymmetry and on the nuclear symmetry energy. We extend
the considerations on the symmetry term from an energy formula to the
respective term in the Hohenberg-Kohn functional. We show, in particular, that
in the limit of an analytic functional, and subject to possible Coulomb
corrections, it is possible to construct isoscalar and isovector densities out
of the proton and neutron densities, that retain a universal relation to each
other, approximately independent of asymmetry. In the so-called local
approximation, the isovector density is inversely proportional to the symmetry
energy in uniform matter at the local isoscalar density. Generalized symmetry
coefficient of a nuclear system is related, in the analytic limit of a
functional, to an integral of the isovector density. We test the relations,
inferred from the Hohenberg-Kohn functional, in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
calculations of half-infinite matter. Within the calculations, we obtain
surface symmetry coefficients and parameters characterizing the densities, for
the majority of Skyrme parameterizations proposed in the literature. The
volume-to-surface symmetry-coefficient ratio and the displacement of nuclear
isovector relative to isoscalar surfaces both strongly increase as the slope of
symmetry energy in the vicinity of normal density increases.

mag deeper than the main-sequence turnoff points, deeper than any previous

Fitting observed ridgelines for each cluster, we provide a homogeneous and
unique set of low-metallicity, single-age fiducial isochrones. The cluster CMDs
are best approximated by the Dartmouth isochrones for all clusters, except for
NGC419 where the Padova isochrones provided the best fit. The CMD of NGC419
shows several main-sequence turn-offs, which belong to the cluster and to the
SMC field. We thus derive an age range of 1.2-1.6 Gyr for NGC419.
Interestingly, our intermediate-age star clusters have a metallicity spread of
~0.6 dex, which demonstrates that the SMC does not have a smooth, monotonic
age-metallicity relation. We find an indication for centrally concentrated blue
straggler star candidates in NGC416, while for the other clusters these are not
present. Using the red clump magnitudes, we find that the closest cluster,
NGC419 (~50kpc), and the farthest cluster, Lindsay 38 (~67kpc), have a relative
distance of ~17kpc, which confirms the large depth of the SMC.

constitute critical test cases for resolving the long standing discrepancy
between the theoretical and observational mass-radius relations at the bottom
of the main sequence. It has been suggested that this discrepancy may be
related to strong stellar magnetic fields, which are not properly accounted for
in current theoretical models. All previously well-characterized low-mass main
sequence EBs have periods of a few days or less, and their components are
therefore expected to be rotating rapidly as a result of tidal synchronization,
thus generating strong magnetic fields. In contrast, the binary system
described here has a period that is over three times longer than previously
characterized low-mass main sequence EBs, and its components rotate relatively
slowly. It is therefore expected to have a weaker magnetic field and to better
match the assumptions of theoretical stellar models. Our follow-up observations
of this EB yield preliminary stellar properties that suggest it is indeed
consistent with current models. If further observations confirm a low level of
activity in this system, these determinations would provide support for the
hypothesis that the mass-radius discrepancy is at least partly due to magnetic
activity.

gas-stripped outer disks of ten Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies, utilizing
SparsePak integral field spectroscopy on the WIYN 3.5m telescope and GALEX UV
photometry. The galaxies in our sample show evidence for being gas-stripped
spiral galaxies, with star formation within a truncation radius, and a passive
population beyond the truncation radius. We find that all of the galaxies with
spatially truncated star formation have outer disk stellar populations
consistent with star formation ending within the last 500 Myr. The synthesis of
optical spectroscopy and GALEX observations demonstrate that star formation was
relatively constant until the quenching time, after which the galaxies
passively evolved. Large starbursts at the time of quenching are excluded for
all galaxies. For approximately half of our galaxies, timescales derived from
our observations are consistent with galaxies being stripped in or near the
cluster core, where simple ram-pressure estimates can explain the stripping.
However, the other half of our sample galaxies were clearly stripped outside
the cluster core. Such galaxies provide evidence that the intra-cluster medium
is not static and smooth. For three of our sample galaxies, our stripping
timescales agree with those from the gas stripping simulations, suggesting that
star formation is quenched near the time of peak pressure. While the stripping
of star-forming gas in the outer disk creates a passive population in our
galaxies, there is still normal star formation in the center of our sample
galaxies. It may be that Virgo is not massive enough to completely strip these
spiral galaxies and, in a more dynamically active cluster or a cluster with a
higher density ICM, such a process would lead to passive spirals and/or S0s.

Despite its importance, cooling rates are generally computed using very
restrictive assumptions, such as collisional ionization equilibrium and solar
relative abundances. We simultaneously relax both assumptions and investigate
the effects of photo-ionization of heavy elements by the meta-galactic UV/X-ray
background and of variations in relative abundances on the cooling rates of
optically thin gas in ionization equilibrium. We find that photo-ionization by
the meta-galactic background radiation reduces the net cooling rates by up to
an order of magnitude for gas densities and temperatures typical of the
shock-heated intergalactic medium and proto-galaxies. In addition,
photo-ionization changes the relative contributions of different elements to
the cooling rates. We conclude that photo-ionization by the ionizing background
and heavy elements both need to be taken into account in order for the cooling
rates to be correct to order of magnitude. Moreover, if the rates need to be
known to better than a factor of a few, then departures of the relative
abundances from solar need to be taken into account. We propose a method to
compute cooling rates on an element-by-element basis by interpolating
pre-computed tables that take photo-ionization into account. We provide such
tables for a popular model of the evolving UV/X-ray background radiation,
computed using the photo-ionization package CLOUDY.

superstructure Mottness exists even in the absence of translation symmetry
breaking by a superlattice, provided that the extended or intersite Coulomb
interaction is strong. In the latter case, superstructure Mottness offers a
unifying framework for the Mott and Wigner physics and a nonperturbative,
strong coupling description of the Wigner-Mott transition. We support our
proposal by studying a minimal single-band ionic Hubbard $t$-$U$-$V$-$\Delta$

but so far a single model for the origin of, in particular, short GRBs does not
exist. The black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) coalescence is a promising
candidate source for short GRBs. Most of binary mergers numerical simulations
were carried out with the purpose of investigating the emission of
gravitational waves. Such a scenario consists of an inspiral, merging and
ringdown phase. In this paper we present the comparison of the observational
results and analytical predictions for a test particle in a quasicircular orbit
around the BH. The emission of gravitational waves causes a rapid decrease of
the orbital radius and a rise of a {\it chirp} of radiation. Matter orbiting
the black hole would be expected to produce high-frequency oscillations (HFO).
Timescales of the coalescence process are of the order of milliseconds and
oscillation frequencies of hundreds Hz for a system with a solar mass BH
companion. We report on the detection of HFO in two short gamma-ray bursts in
this paper. The frequencies and durations of the oscillations are in agreement
with the predicted values. A {\it chirp} phenomenon is identified also. We
therefore argue in favor of BH-NS mergers as a scenario for the production of
short gamma-ray bursts.

parameter space, often have distinctive optical colors. We show that the
separation of family members from background interlopers can be improved with
the aid of SDSS colors as a qualifier for family membership. Based on an
~88,000 object subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Moving Object Catalog 4
with available proper orbital elements, we define 37 statistically robust
asteroid families with at least 100 members using a simple Gaussian
distribution model in both orbital and color space. The interloper rejection
rate based on colors is typically ~10% for a given orbital family definition,
with four families that can be reliably isolated only with the aid of colors.
About 50% of all objects in this data set belong to families, and this fraction
varies from about 35% for objects brighter than an H magnitude of 13 and rises
to 60% for objects fainter than this. The fraction of C-type objects in
families decreases with increasing H magnitude for H > 13, while the fraction
of S-type objects above this limit remains effectively constant. This suggests
that S-type objects require a shorter timescale for equilibrating the
background and family size distributions via collisional processing. The size
distributions for 15 families display a well-defined change of slope and can be
modeled as a ""broken"" double power-law. Such ""broken"" size distributions are
twice as likely for S-type familes than for C-type families, and are dominated
by dynamically old families. The remaining families with size distributions
that can be modeled as a single power law are dominated by young families. When
size distribution requires a double power-law model, the two slopes are
correlated and are steeper for S-type families.

magnetic field structures because of the strong bulk flows in the intracluster
medium. The moving substructures result in cool regions surrounded by the
magnetic field. These will be recognized as magnetized cold fronts in the
observational point of view. A relatively ordered magnetic field structure is
generated just behind the moving substructure. Eddy-like field configurations
are also formed by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These features are similarly
seen even in off-center mergers though the detailed structures change slightly.
The above-mentioned characteristic magnetic field structures are partly
recognized in Faraday rotation measure maps. The higher absolute values of the
rotation measure are expected when observed along the collision axis, because
of the elongated density distribution and relatively ordered field structure
along the axis. The rotation measure maps on the cosmic microwave background
radiation, which covers clusters entirely, could be useful probes of not only
the magnetic field structures but also the internal dynamics of the
intracluster medium.

This allows the detection of transiting planets with relatively long periods,
and the simultaneous study of the host star's photometric variability. In this
letter, we report on the discovery of the transiting giant planet CoRoT-Exo-4b
and use the CoRoT light curve to perform a detailed analysis of the transit and
to determine the stellar rotation period. The CoRoT light curve was
pre-processed to remove outliers and correct for orbital residuals and
artefacts due to hot pixels on the detector. After removing stellar variability
around each transit, the transit light curve was analysed to determine the
transit parameters. A discrete auto-correlation function method was used to
derive the rotation period of the star from the out-of-transit light curve. We
derive periods for the planet's orbit and star's rotation of 9.20205 +/-
0.00037 and 8.87 +/- 1.12 days respectively, consistent with a synchronised
system. We also derive the inclination, i = 90.00 -0.085 +0.000 in degrees, the

compression options every timeslot. Each option requires a different amount of
power and has different compression ratio properties. Further, the wireless
link has potentially time-varying channels, and transmission rates depend on
current channel states and transmission power allocations. We design a dynamic
algorithm for joint compression and transmission, and prove that it comes
arbitrarily close to minimizing average power expenditure, with an explicit
tradeoff in average delay. Our approach uses stochastic network optimization
together with a concept of place holder bits to provide efficient energy-delay
performance. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not require

radiative processes and heating due to WIMP annihilation. We analyze the dark
matter and gas profiles of several halos formed in cosmological-scale numerical
simulations. The heating rate depends sensitively on the dark matter density
profile, which we approximate with a power law rho_chi ~ r^{-alpha_chi}, in the
numerically unresolved inner regions of the halo. If we assume a self-similar
structure so that alpha_chi ~= 1.5 as measured on the resolved scales ~1pc,
then for a fiducial WIMP mass of 100GeV, the heating rate is typically much
smaller (<10^{-3}) than the cooling rate for densities up to
n_H=10^{17}cm^{-3}. In one case, where alpha_chi=1.65, the heating rate becomes
similar to the cooling rate by a density of n_H=10^{15}cm^{-3}. The dark matter
density profile is expected to steepen in the central baryon-dominated region
<~1pc due to adiabatic contraction, and we observe this effect (though with
relatively low resolution) in our numerical models. From these we estimate
alpha_chi~=2.0. The heating now dominates cooling above n_H~=10^{14}cm^{-3}, in
agreement with the previous study of Spolyar, Freese & Gondolo. We expect this
leads to the formation of an equilibrium structure with a baryonic and dark
matter density distribution exhibiting a flattened central core. Examining such
equilibria, we find total luminosities due to WIMP annihilation are relatively
constant and ~10^3 L_sun, set by the radiative luminosity of the baryonic core.

affects the turbulent mixing in the Boussinesq approximation. We discuss ""slow""
reactions where the characteristic reaction time exceeds the temporal scale of
the RT instability. In the early turbulent stage, effects of the flame are
distributed over a maturing mixing zone, whose development is weakly influenced
by the reaction. At later times, the fully mixed zone transforms into a
conglomerate of pure-fluid patches of sizes proportional to the mixing zone
width. In this ""stirred flame'' regime, temperature fluctuations are consumed
by reactions in the regions separating the pure-fluid patches. This DNS-based
qualitative description is followed by a phenomenology suggesting that thin
turbulent flame is of a single-fractal character, and thus distribution of the

three weeks with eleven telescopes, with almost continuous coverage for the
central ten days. This represents the most extensive campaign so far organized
on any solar-type oscillator. We describe in detail the methods we used for
processing and combining the data. These involved calculating weights for the
velocity time series from the measurement uncertainties and adjusting them in
order to minimize the noise level of the combined data. The time series of
velocities for Procyon shows the clear signature of oscillations, with a
plateau of excess power that is centred at 0.9 mHz and is broader than has been
seen for other stars. The mean amplitude of the radial modes is 38.1 +/- 1.3
cm/s (2.0 times solar), which is consistent with previous detections from the
ground and by the WIRE spacecraft, and also with the upper limit set by the
MOST spacecraft. The variation of the amplitude during the observing campaign
allows us to estimate the mode lifetime to be 1.5 d (+1.9/-0.8 d). We also find
a slow variation in the radial velocity of Procyon, with good agreement between
different telescopes. These variations are remarkably similar to those seen in
the Sun, and we interpret them as being due to rotational modulation from
active regions on the stellar surface. The variations appear to have a period
of about 10 days, which presumably equals the stellar rotation period or,
perhaps, half of it. The amount of power in these slow variations indicates
that the fractional area of Procyon covered by active regions is slightly
higher than for the Sun.

transit absorption depends on the selected wavelength range in the stellar line
profile, nor how the atomic hydrogen cloud was distributed spatially around
HD209458b. Here we report a sensitivity study of observed time and spectral
variations of the stellar flux. In particular, the sensitivity of the
absorption depth during transit to the assumed spectral range in the stellar
line profile is shown to be very weak, leading to a transit depth in the range
$(8.4-8.9)%\pm 2.0%$ for all possible wavelength ranges, and thereby confirming
our initially-reported absorption rate. Taking the ratio of the line profile
during transit to the unperturbed line profile, we also show that the spectral
signature of the absorption by the exoplanetary hydrogen nebula is symmetric
and typical of a Lorentzian, optically thick medium. Our results question the
adequacy of models that require a huge absorption and/or a strong asymmetry
between the blue and red side of the absorption line during transit as no such
features could be detected in the HST FUV absorption profile. Finally, we show
that standard atmospheric models of HD209458b provide a good fit to the

spread across many funds, or is it is concentrated in only a few? We argue that
the dominant economic factor that determines this is market efficiency, which
dictates that fund performance is size independent and fund growth is
essentially random. The random process is characterized by entry, exit and
growth. We present a new time-dependent solution for the standard equations
used in the industrial organization literature and show that relaxation to the
steady-state solution is extremely slow. Thus, even if these processes were
stationary (which they are not), the steady-state solution, which is a very
heavy-tailed power law, is not relevant. The distribution is instead
well-approximated by a less heavy-tailed log-normal. We perform an empirical
analysis of the growth of mutual funds, propose a new, more accurate
size-dependent model, and show that it makes a good prediction of the
empirically observed size distribution. While mutual funds are in many respects
like other firms, market efficiency introduces effects that make their growth
process distinctly different. Our work shows that a simple model based on
market efficiency provides a good explanation of the concentration of assets,
suggesting that other effects, such as transaction costs or the behavioral
aspects of investor choice, play a smaller role.

example, at the polarized neutrino electroweak scattering by spinless nuclei.
We derive the structural equations that relate the self-components of mass to
charge, charge radius, and magnetic moment of each neutrino as a consequence of
unification of fermions of a definite flavor. They indicate the availability of
neutrino universality and require following its logic in a constancy law
dependence of the size implied from the multiplication of a weak mass of

of a vector nature, regardless of the difference in their masses, have the same
charge, an identical charge radius, as well as an equal magnetic moment.
Thereby, the possibility appears of establishing the laboratory limits of weak
masses of the investigated types of neutrinos. Finding estimates show clearly
that the earlier measured properties of these particles may testify in favor of
the unified mass structure of their interaction with any of the corresponding

  (1) the K giants in S-type symbiotics rotate at vsini>4.5 km/s, which is 2-4
times faster than the field K giants;
  (2) the M giants in S-type symbiotics rotate on average 1.5 times faster than
the field M giants. Statistical tests show that these differences are highly
significant: p-value < 0.001 in the spectral type bins K2III-K5III,

  (3) our new observations of D'-type symbiotics also confirm that they are

  As a result of the rapid rotation, the cool giants in symbiotics should have
3-30 times larger mass loss rates. Our results suggest also that bipolar

lifetime as Fermi's golden rule. Thermal conductance is predicted by the
Landauer formula with a phenomenological transmission function. The main
advantage of our method is that it covers both ballistic and diffusive limits
and thermal conductance of different system sizes can be easily obtained once
the mode-dependent phonon mean free path is calculated by NEGF. As an
illustration, the method is applied to two one-dimensional atom chain models

spatial distribution data of the eccentric binary V731 Cep was performed.
Spectroscopic orbital elements of the system were obtained by means of
cross-correlation technique. According to the solution of radial velocities
with UBVRcIc light curves, V731 Cep consists of two main-sequence stars with
masses M$_{1}$=2.577 (0.098) M$_{\odot}$, M$_{2}$=2.017 (0.084) M$_{\odot}$,
radii R$_{1}$=1.823 (0.030) R$_{\odot}$, R$_{2}$=1.717 (0.025) R$_{\odot}$, and
temperatures T$_{eff1}$=10700 (200) K, T$_{eff2}$=9265 (220) K separated from
each other by a=23.27 (0.29) R$_{\odot}$ in an orbit with inclination of
88$^{\circ}$.70 (0.03). Analysis of the O--C residuals yielded a rather long
apsidal motion period of U=10000(2500) yr compared to the observational history
of the system. The relativistic contribution to the observed rates of apsidal
motion for V731 Cep is significant (76%). The combination of the absolute
dimensions and the apsidal motion properties of the system yielded consistent
observed internal structure parameter (log$\bar{k}_{2,obs}$=-2.36) compared to
the theory (log$\bar{k}_{2,theo}$=-2.32). Evolutionary investigation of the
binary by two methods (Bayesian and evolutionary tracks) shows that the system
is t=133(26) Myr old and has a metallicity of [M/H]=-0.04(0.02) dex. The
similarities in the spatial distribution and evolutionary properties of V731
Cep with the nearby ($\rho\sim3^{\circ}$.9) open cluster NGC 7762 suggests that
V731 Cep could have been evaporated from NGC 7762.

The modification
is such that the coupling depends on the fraction of synchronized oscillators,
a situation which has been noted in some experiments on coupled Josephson
junctions and mechanical systems. We let the global coupling k be a function of
the Kuramoto order parameter r through an exponent z such that z=1 corresponds
to the standard Winfree model, z<1 strengthens the coupling at low r (low
amount of synchronization) and, at z>1, the coupling is weakened for low r.
Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we find that z controls the
size of the incoherent phase region, and one may make the incoherent behavior
less typical by choosing z<1. We also find that the original Winfree model is a
rather special case, indeed the partial locked behavior disappears for z>1. At
fixed k and varying gamma, the stability boundary of the locked phase
corresponds to a transition that is continuous for z<1 and first-order for z>1.
This change in the nature of the transition is in accordance with a previous
study on a similarly modified Kuramoto model.

cumulative distributions of hypocenter intervals can be described by the

rather it is a consequence of quantum mechanics. The uncertainty relation is
then a probabilistic statement and can be clearly evaded in processes which
occur with a very small probability in a tiny sector of the phase space. This
clear evasion is typically realized when one utilizes indirect measurements,
and some examples of the clear evasion appear in the system with entanglement
though the entanglement by itself is not essential for the evasion. The
standard Kennard's relation and its interpretation remain intact in our
analysis.
  As an explicit example, we show that the clear evasion of the uncertainty
relation for coordinate and momentum in the diffraction process discussed by
Ballentine is realized in a tiny sector of the phase space with a very small
probability. We also examine the uncertainty relation for a two-spin system
with the EPR entanglement and show that no clear evasion takes place in this
system with the finite discrete degrees of freedom.

artificial compressibility method for the Leray weak solutions of the Navier
Stokes equation, used by Temam, in the case of a bounded domain and later in
the case of the whole space. By exploiting the wave equation structure of the
pressure of the approximating system the convergence of the approximating

altimetric data by both Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. In contrast with
Eulerian diagnostics, Lagrangian tools like the local Lyapunov exponents have
the advantage of exploiting both spatial and temporal variability of the
velocity field and are in principle able to unveil subgrid filaments generated
by chaotic stirring. However, one may wonder whether this theoretical advantage
is of practical interest in real-data, mesoscale and submesoscale analysis,
because of the uncertainties and resolution of altimetric products, and the
non-passive nature of biogeochemical tracers. Here we compare the ability of
standard Eulerian diagnostics and the finite-size Lyapunov exponent in
detecting instantaneaous and climatological transport and mixing properties. By
comparing with sea-surface temperature patterns, we find that the two
diagnostics provide similar results for slowly evolving eddies like the first
Alboran gyre. However, the Lyapunov exponent is also able to predict the
(sub-)mesoscale filamentary process occuring along the Algerian current and
above the Balearic Abyssal Plain. Such filaments are also observed, with some
mismatch, in sea-surface temperature patterns. Climatologies of Lyapunov
exponents do not show any compact relation with other Eulerian diagnostics,
unveiling a different structure even at the basin scale. We conclude that
filamentation dynamics can be detected by reprocessing available altimetric
data with Lagrangian tools, giving insight into (sub-)mesoscale stirring
processes relevant to tracer observations and complementing traditional
Eulerian diagnostics.

conduction electron Fermi surface as well as by magnetism. When the non
interacting Fermi surface is close to nesting, the Mott localization
disentangles from the onset of magnetism. First the paramagnetic heavy fermion
metal turns continuously into an itinerant magnet - the Fermi surface evolves
smoothly across the transition - and afterwards Mott localization intervenes
with a discontinuous rearrangement of the Fermi surface. We find that the
$f$-electron localization remains even if magnetism is prevented, and is still
accompanied by a sharp transfer of spectral weigth at the Fermi energy within
the Brillouin zone. We further show that the Mott localization can be also
induced by an external magnetic field, in which case it occurs concomitantly

to Zeeman-Doppler imaging are still the enormous computational requirements. In
every cycle of the iterative interplay between the forward process (spectral
synthesis) and the inverse process (derivative based optimization) the Stokes
profile synthesis requires several thousand evaluations of the polarized
radiative transfer equation for a given stellar surface model. To cope with
these computational demands and to allow for the incorporation of a full Stokes
profile synthesis into Doppler- and Zeeman-Doppler imaging applications as well
as into large scale solar Stokes profile inversions, we present a novel fast
and accurate synthesis method for calculating local Stokes profiles. Our
approach is based on artificial neural network models, which we use to
approximate the complex non-linear mapping between the most important
atmospheric parameters and the corresponding Stokes profiles. A number of
specialized artificial neural networks, are used to model the functional
relation between the model atmosphere, magnetic field strength, field
inclination, and field azimuth, on one hand and the individual components
(I,Q,U,V) of the Stokes profiles, on the other hand. We performed an extensive
statistical evaluation and show that our new approach yields accurate local as
well as disk-integrated Stokes profiles over a wide range of atmospheric
conditions. The mean rms errors for the Stokes I and V profiles are well below
0.2% compared to the exact numerical solution. Errors for Stokes Q and U are in
the range of 1%. Our approach does not only offer an accurate approximation to
the LTE polarized radiative transfer it, moreover, accelerates the synthesis by
a factor of more than 1000.

mass and variability amplitude in quasars. Roughly 100 quasars at z<0.75 were
selected by matching objects from the QUEST1 Variability Survey with
broad-lined objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Black hole masses were
estimated with the virial method using the broad Hbeta line, and variability
was characterized from the QUEST1 light curves. The correlation between black
hole mass and variability amplitude is significant at the 99% level or better
and does not appear to be caused by obvious selection effects inherent to
flux-limited samples. It is most evident for rest frame time lags of the order
a few months up to the QUEST1 maximum temporal resolution of about 2 years. The
correlation between black hole mass and variability amplitude means that the
more massive black holes have larger percentage flux variations. Over 2-3
orders of magnitude in black hole mass, the amplitude increases by
approximately 0.2 mag. A likely explanation for the correlation is that the
more massive black holes are starving and produce larger flux variations
because they do not have a steady inflow of gaseous fuel. Assuming that the
variability arises from changes in the accretion rate Li & Cao [8] show that
flux variations similar to those observed are expected as a consequence of the
more massive black holes having cooler accretion disks.

$-0.012<\Omega_k<0.009$ (95% C.L.) when fixing $w_{\DE}=-1$. When considering

$\sum m_{\nu}<0.533$ eV (95% C.L.) within the framework of the flat

more than $2 \sigma$ confidence level. However, in the framework of dynamical
dark energy models, the allowed region in the parameter space of ($n_s$,$r$) is
enlarged significantly. Finally, we find no evidence for the large running of

that an intrinsic conductivity of graphene (purely ambipolar system where both

electron-hole scattering. It has a universal value independent of temperature.
We give an explicit derivation based on scaling theory. When there is even a
small discrepancy in electron and hole densities caused by applied gate voltage
the conductivity is determined by both strong electron-hole scattering and weak
external scattering: on defects or phonons. We suggest that a density of
charged defects (occupancy of defects) depends on Fermi energy to explain a
sub-linear dependence of conductivity on a fairly high gate voltage observed in

acids are encoded by more than one codon. These synonymous codons are not used
equally; there is a Codon Usage Bias (CUB). This article will provide novel
information about the origin and evolution of this bias.
  Results: Codon Usage Bias (CUB, defined here as deviation from equal usage of
synonymous codons) was studied in 113 species. The average CUB was 29.3 +/-
1.1% (S.E.M, n=113) of the theoretical maximum and declined progressively with
evolution and increasing genome complexity. A Pan-Genomic Codon Usage Frequency
(CUF) Table was constructed to describe genome-wide relationships among codons.
Significant correlations were found between the number of synonymous codons and
(i) the frequency of the respective amino acids (ii) the size of CUB. Numerous,
statistically highly significant, internal correlations were found among codons
and the nucleic acids they comprise. These strong correlations made it possible
to predict missing synonymous codons (wobble bases) reliably from the remaining
codons or codon residues.
  Conclusions: The results put the concept of ""codon bias"" into a novel
perspective. The internal connectivity of codons indicates that all synonymous
codons might be integrated parts of the Genetic Code with equal importance in
maintaining its functional integrity.

history in terms of the characteristic epoch of accretion and mass and orbits
of progenitor objects. The study utilizes a suite of eleven stellar halo models
constructed within the context of a standard LCDM cosmology. The results
demonstrate that coordinate-space studies are sensitive to the recent (0-8
Gyears ago) merger histories of galaxies (this timescale corresponds to the
last few to tens of percent of mass accretion for a Milky-Way-type galaxy).
Specifically, the {\it frequency, sky coverage} and {\it fraction of stars} in
substructures in the stellar halo as a function of surface brightness are
indicators of the importance of recent merging and of the luminosity function
of infalling dwarfs. The {\it morphology} of features serves as a guide to the
orbital distribution of those dwarfs. Constraints on the earlier merger history
(> 8 Gyears ago) can be gleaned from the abundance patterns in halo stars:
within our models, dramatic differences in the dominant epoch of accretion or
luminosity function of progenitor objects leave clear signatures in the
[alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H] distributions of the stellar halo - halos dominated by
very early accretion have higher average [alpha/Fe], while those dominated by
high luminosity satellites have higher [Fe/H]. This intuition can be applied to
reconstruct much about the merger histories of nearby galaxies from current and
future data sets.

the stability of the system is achieved by maximizing a weighted sum rate
capacity with suitable weights that depend on the queue size. The weighted sum
rate capacity using Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) and Zero Forcing (ZF) is
asymptotically equivalent to the weighted sum capacity over parallel
single-channels. In this paper, we study the Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff
(DMT) of the fading broadcast channel under a fixed weighted sum rate capacity
constraint. The DMT of both identical and different parallel weighted MISO
channels is first derived. Finally, we deduce the DMT of a broadcast channel

of transiting or eclipsing configurations between arbitrary numbers of several
types of objects, which may be stars, planets, planetary moons, and planetary
rings. Applications of UTM to date have been mainly in the generation of
light-curves for the testing of detection algorithms. For the preparation of
such test for the Corot Mission, a special version has been used to generate
multicolour light-curves in Corot's passbands. A separate fitting program, UFIT
(Universal Fitter) is part of the UTM distribution and may be used to derive
best fits to light-curves for any set of continuously variable parameters.

semigroups that arise from groupoids, leading to a precise bijection between
the class of etale groupoids and the class of complete and infinitely

explain the sense in which quantales and localic groupoids carry a

  for symmetric binary-input memoryless channels","The version which appears in the IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory, July 2009",,"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021379",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code
sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity $I(W)$ of any given binary-input
discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) $W$. The symmetric capacity is the highest
rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal
probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to
synthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC $W$, a second set of
$N$ binary-input channels $\{W_N^{(i)}:1\le i\le N\}$ such that, as $N$ becomes
large, the fraction of indices $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 1
approaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 0
approaches $1-I(W)$. The polarized channels $\{W_N^{(i)}\}$ are
well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through
those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes
constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves
that, given any B-DMC $W$ with $I(W)>0$ and any target rate $R < I(W)$, there
exists a sequence of polar codes $\{{\mathscr C}_n;n\ge 1\}$ such that
${\mathscr C}_n$ has block-length $N=2^n$, rate $\ge R$, and probability of
block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as $P_{e}(N,R) \le
\bigoh(N^{-\frac14})$ independently of the code rate. This performance is
achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity $O(N\log N)$ for each.

calculate the three-dimensional Green function associated with this physical

core the self-energy presents two distinct contributions. The first is induced
by the geometry associated with the spacetime under consideration, and the
second one is a correction due to the non-vanishing inner structure attributed
to it. Considering specifically the ballpoint-pen model for the region inside,
we were able to obtain exact expressions for the self-energies in the regions
outside and inside the monopole's core.

In the beam-nulling scheme, the eigenvector of the weakest subchannel is fed
back and then signals are sent over a generated subspace orthogonal to the
weakest subchannel. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the
capacity of beam-nulling is closed to the optimal water-filling at medium SNR.
Additionally, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of MMSE receiver
is derived for beam-nulling. Then the paper presents the associated average
bit-error rate (BER) of beam-nulling numerically which is verified by
simulation. Simulation results are also provided to compare beam-nulling with
beamforming. To improve performance further, beam-nulling is concatenated with
linear dispersion code. Simulation results are also provided to compare the
concatenated beam-nulling scheme with the beamforming scheme at the same data
rate. Additionally, the existing beamforming and new proposed beam-nulling can
be extended if more than one eigenvector is available at the transmitter. The
new extended schemes are called multi-dimensional (MD) beamforming and MD
beam-nulling. Theoretical analysis and numerical results in terms of capacity
are also provided to evaluate the new extended schemes. Simulation results show
that the MD scheme with LDC can outperform the MD scheme with STBC
significantly when the data rate is high.
