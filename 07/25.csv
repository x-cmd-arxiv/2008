been used, one for zero-temperature and the other for finite temperatures. We
have found that the system sustains superconductivity in the ground state up to
a critical impurity concentration, $f_c$, which increases with $U$, at least up
to U=4 (in units of the hopping energy). Also, the normalized zero-temperature
gap as a function of $f$ shows a maximum near $f\sim 0.07$, for $2\lesssim
U\lesssim 6$. Analyses of the helicity modulus and of the pair structure factor
led to the determination of the critical temperature as a function of $f$, for

increasing with $U$ in this range. We argue that, overall, the observed

compounds containing layers of iron arsenide have revealed a new class of high

familiar cuprates. In both series of compounds, the onset of superconductivity
is associated with the suppression of magnetic order by doping holes and/or
electrons into the band leading to theories in which magnetic fluctuations are
either responsible for or strongly coupled to the superconducting order
parameter. In the cuprates, theories of magnetic pairing have been invoked to
explain the observation of a resonant magnetic excitation that scales in energy
with the superconducting energy gap and is suppressed above the superconducting
transition temperature, Tc. Such resonant excitations have been shown by
inelastic neutron scattering to be a universal feature of the cuprate
superconductors, and have even been observed in heavy fermion superconductors
with much lower transition temperatures. In this paper, we show neutron
scattering evidence of a resonant excitation in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, which is a
superconductor below 38K, at the momentum transfer associated with magnetic
order in the undoped compound, BaFe2As2, and at an energy transfer that is
consistent with scaling in other strongly correlated electron superconductors.
As in the cuprates, the peak disappears at Tc providing the first experimental
confirmation of a strong coupling of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum to the
superconducting order parameter in the new iron arsenide superconductors.

recession velocity, yielding about 20 Mpc for H_0 = 72 km/s/Mpc. Recently, this
widely adopted distance has been challenged based on photometry of the presumed
tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), which seems to yield a shorter distance of
13.3+-1.0 Mpc and, with it, nearly 1 mag lower luminosities and smaller radii
for objects in this prototypical merger. Here we present a new distance
estimate based on observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2007sr in the
southern tail, made at Las Campanas Observatory as part of the Carnegie
Supernova Project. The resulting distance of D(SN Ia) = 22.3+-2.8 Mpc [(m-M)_0
= 31.74+-0.27 mag] is in good agreement with a refined distance estimate based
on the recession velocity and the large-scale flow model developed by Tonry and
collaborators, D(flow) = 22.5+-2.8 Mpc. We point out three serious problems
that a short distance of 13.3 Mpc would entail, and trace the claimed short
distance to a likely misidentification of the TRGB. Reanalyzing Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) data in the Archive with an improved method, we find a TRGB
fainter by 0.9 mag and derive from it a preliminary new TRGB distance of
D(TRGB) = 20.0+-1.6 Mpc. Finally, assessing our three distance estimates we

produced by simulated measurements of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has
been performed by fitting a 3rd-order polynomial along the spectral dimension
of each pixel in the data cubes. The simulations are the first to include the
unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna
beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional
spherically-binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum to within
approximately 1% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 < k <
1 Mpc^-1) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the
EoR signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky
maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of
the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the
best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground
subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements
to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense
uv-coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and
produced very good results on scales corresponding to |u| < 500 wavelengths in
the uv-plane without any selective editing of the uv-coverage.

axes with ~3300 radial velocities from 32 bulge fields and one disk field. We
construct a longitude-velocity plot for the bulge stars and find that, contrary
to previous studies, the bulge does not rotate as a solid body; for |l|<4
degree the rotation curve has a slope of roughly 100 km/s/kpc and flattens
considerably at greater l, reaching a maximum rotation of 75 km/s. We compare
our rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile to both the self-consistent
model of Zhao (1996) and to N-body models; neither satisfactorily fit both
measured rotation and dispersion. We place the bulge on the plot of
(Vmax/sigma) vs. epsilon and find that the bulge lies near the oblate rotator
line, and very close to the parameters of NGC 4565, an edge-on spiral galaxy
with a bulge similar to that of the Milky Way. We find that our summed velocity

the energy of the highest peak is higher than that of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}. These

an important clue as to whether phonons are the main contributors to

basic operations which is used by most program transformation systems is
unfolding which consists in the replacement of a procedure call by its
definition. While there is a large body of literature on transformation and
unfolding of sequential programs, very few papers have addressed this issue for
concurrent languages and, to the best of our knowledge, no other has considered
unfolding of CHR programs.
  This paper defines a correct unfolding system for CHR programs. We define an
unfolding rule, show its correctness and discuss some conditions which can be
used to delete an unfolded rule while preserving the program meaning. We prove
that confluence and termination properties are preserved by the above
transformations.

Using MIPS [24] measurements and stellar parameters we determine the nature of
the infrared excess for 19 GLIMPSE stars. We find that 15 stars exhibit Halpha
emission and four exhibit Halpha absorption. Assuming that the mid-IR excesses
arise in circumstellar disks, we use the Halpha fluxes to model and estimate
the relative contributions of dust and free-free emission. Six stars exhibit
Halpha fluxes that imply free-free emission can plausibly explain the infrared
excess at [24]. These stars are candidate classical Be stars. Nine stars
exhibit Halpha emission, but their Halpha fluxes are insufficient to explain
the infrared excesses at [24], suggesting the presence of a circumstellar dust
component. After the removal of the free-free component in these sources, we
determine probable disk dust temperatures of Tdisk~300-800 K and fractional
infrared luminosities of L(IR)/L(*)~10^-3. These nine stars may be
pre-main-sequence stars with transitional disks undergoing disk clearing. Three
of the four sources showing Halpha absorption exhibit circumstellar disk

the non-linearity between the curvature perturbations and the fluctuations of

both can yield a large positive $f_{\rm NL}$ but with a different sign of

models by looking at the sign of $g_{\rm NL}$. Furthermore, we work on some

likely to be generated and there are two types of solitons -- fundamental
solitons (which is a localized and stable state) and sub-fundamental solitons
(which is a lacalized but unstable state). In addition, we find that the
pinning position and the amplitude of the fundamental soliton in the lattice

show the remarkable $L$ dependences. In addition, the dependences for the

On the persistent current, the amplitude for the cases with odd legs shows
power-low behavior as $L^{-N}$ with $N$ being the number of legs, whereas the
maximum of it decreases exponentially for the cases with even legs. The
conductance per one spin normalized by $e^2/h$ behaves as follows. In the even

degeneracy of non-supersymmetric vacua. As a generalization of the original
O'Raifeartaigh's result, the existence of instability or degeneracy is true to
any higher order corrections at tree level for models even with
non-renormalizable superpotentials. The degeneracy generically coincides the
R-axion direction under some assumptions of R-charge assignment, but generally
requires neither R-symmetries nor any assumption of generic superpotentials.
The result also confirms the well-known fact that tree level supersymmetry
breaking is a very rare occurrence in global supersymmetric theories with
minimal K\""ahler potentials. The implication for effective field theory method
in the landscape is discussed and we point out that choosing models with
minimal K\""ahler potentials may result in unexpected answers to the vacuum
statistics. Supergravity theories or theories with non-minimal K\""ahler
potentials in general do not suffer from the existence of instability or
degeneracy. But very strong gauge dynamics or small compactification dimension
reduces the K\""ahler potential from non-minimal to minimal, and gravity
decoupling limit reduces supergravity to global supersymmetry. Instability or
degeneracy may appear in these limits. Away from these limits, a large number
of non-SUSY vacua may still be found in an intermediate region.

field theory (CFT) formulation of the superstring in the pp-wave background
with Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux, using the Green-Schwarz formalism in the
semi-light-cone conformal gauge. Due to the presence of the RR flux, the left-
and the right-moving degrees of freedom on the worldsheet are inherently
coupled and this makes the canonical analysis intractable even at the classical
level. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a phase-space formulation which
does not make use of the equations of motion, and construct two independent
sets of Virasoro generators classically. Upon quantization, due to the presence
of the RR flux, the Virasoro algebra generically develops quantum operator
anomalies and only with a judicious choice of normal ordering rescription they
cancel between the bosonic and the fermionic contributions. With such properly
defined quantum Virasoro generators, one can construct the BRST operators and
demonstrate that the BRST cohomology analysis reproduces the physical spectrum
previously obtained in the light-cone gauge.

of multi-center randomized clinical trials which only rely on the randomization
process as a basis of inference. Our motivation is prompted by the fact that
most current statistical procedures used in the analysis of randomized
multi-center studies are model based. The randomization feature of the trials
is usually ignored. An important characteristic of model based analysis is that
it is straightforward to model covariates. Nevertheless, in nearly all model
based analyses, the effects due to different centers and, in general, the
design of the clinical trials are ignored. An alternative to a model based
analysis is to have analyses guided by the design of the trial. Our development
of design based methods allows the incorporation of centers as well as other
features of the trial design. The methods make use of conditioning on the
ancillary statistics in the sample space generated by the randomization
process. We have investigated the power of the methods and have found that, in
the presence of center variation, there is a significant increase in power. The
methods have been extended to group sequential trials with similar increases in
power.

clearly distinguishing himself from George Bush on economic policy? At first
thought, the logic of political preferences would suggest not: the Republicans
are to the right of most Americans on economic policy, and so in a
one-dimensional space with party positions measured with no error, the optimal
strategy for the Democrats would be to stand infinitesimally to the left of the
Republicans. The median voter theorem suggests that each party should keep its
policy positions just barely distinguishable from the opposition. In a
multidimensional setting, however, or when voters vary in their perceptions of
the parties' positions, a party can benefit from putting some daylight between
itself and the other party on an issue where it has a public-opinion advantage
(such as economic policy for the Democrats). We set up a plausible theoretical
model in which the Democrats could achieve a net gain in votes by moving to the
left on economic policy, given the parties' positions on a range of issue
dimensions. We then evaluate this model based on survey data on voters'
perceptions of their own positions and those of the candidates in 2004. Under
our model, it turns out to be optimal for the Democrats to move slightly to the
right but staying clearly to the left of the Republicans' current position on

not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for

method of Bair et al in several ways: a comprehensive variable ranking is
combined with a selection of the best number of components for PCR, and the new
method further extends to regression with multivariate responses. The new
method is particularly suited to HDLSS problems. Applications to simulated and

variables are highly correlated and redundant. Maybe more importantly,
interpretation of the results is intuitive. Useful insights about relevant
groups of variables can be gained. Our comments and questions include: (i)
Could the success of treelets be replicated by a combination of hierarchical
clustering and PCA? (ii) When choosing a suitable basis, treelets seem to be
largely an unsupervised method. Could the results be even more interpretable

perturbation theory in the tunneling Hamiltonian and the complete molecular

cotunneling and pair tunneling, but also contains terms contributing to
renormalization of the molecular resonances as well as their broadening. Due to
the latter all terms in the perturbation expansion are automatically
well-defined for any set of system parameters, no divergences occur and no
by-hand regularization is required. Additionally we show that, in contrast to
2nd order perturbation theory, in 4th order it is essential to account for
quantum coherence between non-degenerate states, entering the theory through
the non-diagonal elements of the density matrix. As a first application, we
study a single-molecule transistor coupled to a localized vibrational mode
(Anderson-Holstein model). We find that cotunneling-assisted sequential
tunneling processes involving the vibration give rise to current peaks i.e.
negative differential conductance in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Such peaks
occur in the cross-over to strong electron-vibration coupling, where inelastic
cotunneling competes with Franck-Condon suppressed sequential tunneling, and
thereby indicate the strength of the electron-vibration coupling. The peaks
depend sensitively on the coupling to a dissipative bath, thus providing also
an experimental probe of the Q-factor of the vibrational motion.

show that, while the choice of T does not change the ranking of conservation

planet is a key challenge of science. The Tree of Life represents such
diversification processes through the evolutionary relationships among the
different taxa, and can be extended down to intra-specific relationships. Here
we examine the topological properties of a large set of interspecific and
intraspecific phylogenies and show that the branching patterns follow
allometric rules conserved across the different levels in the Tree of Life, all
significantly departing from those expected from the standard null models. The
finding of non-random universal patterns of phylogenetic differentiation
suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification across the
broad range of scales, from macro-evolutionary to micro-evolutionary processes,
shaping the diversity of life on the planet.

scale of the onset of nonlinear evolution to the scale of dissipation, the
velocity and mass density fields of cosmic baryon fluid are extremely well
described by the self-similar log-Poisson hierarchy. As a consequence of this
evolution, the relations among various physical quantities of cosmic baryon
fluid should be scale invariant, if the physical quantities are measured in
cells on scales larger than the dissipation scale, regardless the baryon fluid
is in virialized dark halo, or in pre-virialized state. We examine this
property with the relation between the Compton parameter of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, $y(r)$, and X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm x}(r)$, where
$r$ being the scale of regions in which $y$ and $L_{\rm x}$ are measured.
According to the self-similar hierarchical scenario of nonlinear evolution, one
should expect that 1.) in the $y(r)$-$L_x(r)$ relation, $y(r)=10^{A(r)}[L_{\rm
x}(r)]^{\alpha(r)}$, the coefficients $A(r)$ and $\alpha(r)$ are
scale-invariant; 2.) The relation $y(r)=10^{A(r)}[L_{\rm x}(r)]^{\alpha(r)}$
given by cells containing collapsed objects is also available for cells without
collapsed objects, only if $r$ is larger than the dissipation scale. These two
predictions are well established with a scale decomposition analysis of
observed data, and a comparison of observed $y(r)$-$L_x(r)$ relation with
hydrodynamic simulation samples. The implication of this result on the
characteristic scales of non-gravitational heating is also addressed.

in a previous publication in order to describe the dynamics of a two
dimensional chain. In this paper the model is extended to d dimensions and a
bending energy term is added to its action. As an application, two observables
are computed in the case of a very stiff chain. The first observable is the
dynamical form factor of a ring shaped chain. The second observable is a
straightforward generalization to dynamics of the static form factor. This
observable is relevant in order to estimate the average distance between two
arbitrary points of the chain. Finally, a variant of the GNLNM is presented, in
which the topological conditions which constrain the motion of two linked
chains are imposed with the help of the Gauss linking invariant.

optical train that images the sky onto the focal plane with a plate scale of
0.45 arcsec per 18 micron pixel. A mosaic of four Hawaii 2RG of 2k x 2k made by
Teledyne is used as detector and will give a field of view of 31.9 arcmin x
31.9 arcmin. This cryogenic instrument has been optimized for the Y, J, H and K
bands. Special care has been taken in the selection of the standard IR
materials used for the optics in order to maximize the instrument throughput
and to include the z band. The main challenges of this design are: to produce a
well defined internal pupil which allows reducing the thermal background by a
cryogenic pupil stop; the correction of off-axis aberrations due to the large
field available; the correction of chromatic aberration because of the wide
spectral coverage; and the capability of introduction of narrow band filters
(~1%) in the system minimizing the degradation in the filter passband without a
collimated stage in the camera. We show the optomechanical error budget and
compensation strategy that allows our as built design to met the performances
from an optical point of view. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the
design showing the performances of PANIC at the CAHA 3.5m telescope.

accelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated. The effectiveness
of this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which
molecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the
longitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can
reduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator
operates such that only every third electric field stage is used for
deceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate
stages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this
so-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the
conventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by
passing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The
experiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory
calculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D
acceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator
in the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value
that is obtained when any couplings are neglected.

potentials that arise due to Berry's phase when an atom moves slowly in a light
field. Starting from the full quantum Hamiltonian, we turn to a classical
description of the atomic centre-of-mass motion while still treating the
internal degrees of freedom as quantum variables. We show that the scalar
potential can be identified as the kinetic energy of an atomic micro-motion
caused by quantum fluctuations of the radiative force, and that the
Lorentz-type force appears as a result of the motion-induced perturbation of
the internal atomic state. For a specific configuration involving two
counter-propagating Gaussian laser beams, we relate the geometric forces to the
radiation pressure and dipole forces known from quantum optics. The simple
physical pictures provided by the present analysis may help for the design and
the implementation of novel geometric forces.

embedded cluster Cr 404. The Vul OB1 association includes the H II region
Sh2-86, and its stellar content is younger ($\approx3$ Myr) than that of Bochum
1 ($\approx9$ Myr), which shows no gas emission. Bochum 1 harbours one of the
newly found compact clusters as its core. The RDP of Bochum 1 is irregular and
cannot be fitted by a King-like profile, which suggests important erosion or
dispersion of stars from a primordial cluster. Similarly to Bochum 1, the
decontaminated CMD of NGC 6823 presents conspicuous MS and PMS sequences. Taken
separately, RDPs of MS and PMS stars follow a King-like profile. The core shows
an important excess density of MS stars that mimics the profile of a post-core
collapse cluster. At such young age, it can be explained by an excess of stars
formed in the prominent core. The present study suggests that Bochum 1 is a
star cluster fossil remain that might be dynamically evolving into an OB
association. Bochum 1 can be a missing link connecting early star cluster
dissolution with the formation of low-mass OB associations.

the Neumann-Kirchoff-de Gennes matching conditions at the vertices.
Alternatively, one replaces each wire by a finite number of ""atoms"", and then
uses the tight binding model for the solution. Here we show that these
approaches cannot generally give the same results, except for special energies.
Even in the limit of vanishing lattice constant, the two approaches coincide
only if the tight binding parameters obey very special relations. The different

periodic inhomogeneous systems such as the lamellar smectic state and delays
self diffusion of particles even in uniform systems. We compare our theory with

accelerated in an ultrarelativistic blastwave with the pre-existing magnetic
field of the medium into which the blastwave propagates. While particle
acceleration processes such as diffusive shock acceleration can accelerate ions
and electrons, the accelerated electrons suffer larger radiative losses. Under
certain conditions, the ions can attain higher energies and reach farther ahead
of the shock than the electrons, and so the nonthermal particles can be
partially charge-separated. To compensate for the charge separation, the
upstream plasma develops a return current, which, as it flows across the
magnetic field, drives transverse acceleration of the upstream plasma and a
growth of density contrast in the shock upstream. If the density contrast is
strong by the time the fluid is shocked, vorticity is generated at the shock
transition. The resulting turbulence can amplify the post-shock magnetic field
to the levels inferred from gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra and light curves.
Therefore, since the upstream inhomogeneities are induced by the ions
accelerated in the shock, they are generic even if the blastwave propagates
into a medium of uniform density. We speculate about the global structure of
the shock precursor, and delineate several distinct physical regimes that are
classified by an increasing distance from the shock and, correspondingly, a
decreasing density of nonthermal particles that reach that distance.

envelope at scales of 50 milli arcsecond and 0.6 arcsec (100-1000 AU),

spatial data are achieved using self-consistent spherical envelope modelling.
We conclude that those MYSO envelopes that are best described by a spherical
geometry, the commensurate density distribution is a powerlaw with index -1.0.
Such a powerlaw is predicted if the envelope is supported by turbulence on the
100-1000AU scales probed with MIDI and COMICS, but the role of rotation at
these spatial scales need testing.

allows to define non-perturbatively {\it differential} renormalization group
equations. It accommodates any general stable polynomial Lagrangian. It can
equally well treat noncommutative models or matrix models such as the

hydrodinamic-like expansion regimes to the Coulomb explosion (CE) regime when
increasing the ratio between the thermal energy of the electrons and the
electrostatic energy stored in the cluster. It is shown that a suitable
double-pump irradiation scheme can produce hybrid expansion regimes, wherein a
slow hydrodynamic expansion is followed by a fast CE, leading to ion overtaking
and producing multiple ion flows expanding with different velocities. This can
be exploited to obtain intracluster fusion reactions in both homonuclear
deuterium clusters and heteronuclear deuterium-tritium clusters, as also proved
by three-dimensional molecular-dynamics simulations.

(PAPR) and also impose a severe constraint on hardware implementation of the
code when turning off some of the transmitting antennas whenever a zero is
transmitted. Recently, rate 1/2 SCODs with no zero entry have been reported for
8 transmit antennas. In this paper, SCODs with no zero entry for $2^a$ transmit
antennas whenever $a+1$ is a power of 2, are constructed which includes the 8
transmit antennas case as a special case. More generally, for arbitrary values
of $a$, explicit construction of $2^a\times 2^a$ rate $\frac{a+1}{2^a}$ SCODs
with the ratio of number of zero entries to the total number of entries equal
to $1-\frac{a+1}{2^a}2^{\lfloor log_2(\frac{2^a}{a+1}) \rfloor}$ is reported,
whereas for standard known constructions, the ratio is $1-\frac{a+1}{2^a}$. The
codes presented do not result in increased signaling complexity. Simulation
results show that the codes constructed in this paper outperform the codes
using the standard construction under peak power constraint while performing
the same under average power constraint.
