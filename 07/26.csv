ages and the epoch of reionization, as well as a tool for observational
cosmology in general. However, serious sources of foreground contamination must
be subtracted for experimental efforts to be viable. In this paper, we focus on
the removal of unresolved extragalactic point sources with smooth spectra, and
evaluate how the residual foreground contamination after cleaning depends on
instrumental and algorithmic parameters. A crucial but often ignored
complication is that the synthesized beam of an interferometer array shrinks
towards higher frequency, causing complicated frequency structure in each sky
pixel as ""frizz"" far from the beam center contracts across unresolved radio
sources. We find that current-generation experiments should nonetheless be able
to clean out this points source contamination adequately, and quantify the
instrumental and algorithmic design specifications required to meet this
foreground challenge.

produce the prompt gamma-ray emission in Gamma-Ray Bursts. IC requires low

them. The same electrons can upscatter the gamma-ray photons to even higher
energies in the TeV range. Using the current upper limits on the prompt optical
emission we show here that under general conservative assumption the IC
mechanism suffers from an ""energy crisis"". Namely, IC will over-produce a very
high energy component that would carry much more energy than the observed
prompt gamma-rays. Our analysis is general and it makes no assumptions on the
specific mechanism that produces the relativistic electrons population.

hydrogen ionised depends crucially on the average rate of recombinations in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). This rate is proportional to the clumping factor C
= <rho_b^2> / avg(rho_b)^2, where rho_b and avg(rho_b) are the local and cosmic
mean baryon density, respectively, and the brackets < > indicate spatial
averaging over the recombining gas in the IGM. We perform a suite of
cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative
cooling to calculate the volume-weighted clumping factor of the IGM at
redshifts z >= 6. We focus on the effect of photo-ionisation heating by a
uniform ultra-violet background and find that photo-heating strongly reduces
the clumping factor because the increased pressure support smoothes out
small-scale density fluctuations. Photo-ionisation heating is often said to
provide a negative feedback on the reionisation of the IGM because it
suppresses the cosmic star formation rate by boiling the gas out of low-mass
halos. However, because of the reduction of the clumping factor it also makes
it easier to keep the IGM ionised. Photo-heating therefore also provides a
positive feedback which, while known to exist, has received much less
attention. We demonstrate that this positive feedback is in fact very strong.
Using conservative assumptions, we find that if the IGM was reheated at z >~ 9,
the observed population of star-forming galaxies at z = 6 may be sufficient to
keep the IGM ionised, provided that the fraction of ionising photons that
escape the star-forming regions to ionise the IGM is larger than 0.2.

This model indicates that the broad line can be described with superposition of
two Gaussian components (Very Broad Gaussian Component (VBGC) and InterMediate
Gaussian Component (IMGC)) which are from two physically distinct regions;
i.e., Very Broad Line Region (VBLR) and InterMediate Line Region (IMLR). We

to the geometry, density and evolution of these two regions. Micro-lensing
result of BLR in J1131-1231 and some unexplained phenomena in Reverberation
Mapping (RM) experiment provide supportive evidence for this model. Our results
indicate that the radius obtained from the emission line RM normally
corresponds to the radius of the VBLR, and the existence of the IMGC may affect
the measurement of the black hole masses in AGNs. The deviation of NLS1s from
the M-sigma relation and the Type II AGN fraction as a function of luminosity
can be explained in this model in a coherent way. The evolution of the two
emission regions may be related to the evolutionary stages of the broad line
regions of AGNs from NLS1s to BLS1s. Based on the results presented here, a
unified picture of hierarchical evolution of black hole, dust torus and galaxy

and the large number of wires which can be introduced into the pressure
chamber. In these pressure cells soft solid pressure mediums like steatite are
used. We have succeeded in adapting the Bridgman cell to liquid pressure
mediums. With this breakthrough it is now possible to measure in very good
hydrostatic pressure conditions up to 7 GPa, which is about twice the pressure
attainable in piston-cylinder cells. The pressure gradient in the cell,
estimated from the superconducting transition width of lead, is reduced by a
factor of five in the liquid medium with respect to steatite. By the use of
non-magnetic materials for the anvils and the clamp and due to the small
dimensions of the latter, our device is specially suitable for
magneto-transport measurements in dilution fridges. This pressure cell has been
developed to measure very fragile and brittle samples like organic conductors.
Resistivity measurements of (TMTTF)2BF4 performed in a solid and liquid
pressure medium demonstrate the necessity of hydrostatic pressure conditions
for the study of organic conductors at high pressures.

of the Yang Baxter solution are roots of unity, leads to the conclusion that
all the images are finite.
  Using results of Turaev, we have also identified cases in which one would get
a link invariant. Finally, by observing the group algebra generated by the

of dust at a temperature of $\sim 50-65$ K, heated by the shock wave generated
by the PWN being driven into the inner edge of the ejecta. This is evidently
dust synthesized in the supernova. We also report the detection of several
lines in the spectrum of the PWN, and present kinematic information about the
PWN as determined from these lines. Kinematics are consistent with previous
optical studies of this object. Line strengths are also broadly consistent with
what one expects from optical line strengths. We find that lines arise from
slow ($\sim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) shocks driven into oxygen-rich clumps in the shell
swept-up by an iron-nickel bubble, which have a density contrast of $\sim
100-200$ relative to the bulk of the ejecta, and that faster shocks ($\sim 250$

observed temperatures. We infer from estimates of heavy-element ejecta

this LAE is not only the brightest narrow-band object with L(Lya) = 3.9+/-0.2 x
10^43 erg/s in our survey volume of 10^6 Mpc^3, but also a spatially extended

up to ~100 km/s around the minor axis of the bulge, consistent with
axisymmetry. The velocity dispersion map shows a weak gradient increasing
towards a central (R<1"") value of sigma_0=170+/-9 km/s. We deproject the
observed surface brightness from HST imaging to obtain a realistic luminosity
density of the lens galaxy, which in turn is used to build axisymmetric
dynamical models that fit the observed kinematic maps. We also construct a
gravitational lens model that accurately fits the positions and relative fluxes
of the four quasar images. We find that the resulting luminous and total mass
distribution are nearly identical around the Einstein radius R_E = 0.89"", with
a slope that is close to isothermal, but which becomes shallower towards the
center if indeed mass follows light. The dynamical model fits to the observed
kinematic maps result in a total mass-to-light ratio (M/L)_dyn=3.7+/-0.5
M_sun/L_sun,I (in the I-band). This is consistent with the Einstein mass M_E =

activity on stellar mass, halo mass, and group hierarchy (centrals vs.
satellites). We split our galaxy sample in star-forming galaxies, galaxies with
optical AGN activity and radio sources. We find a smooth transition in halo
mass as the activity of central galaxies changes from star formation to optical
AGN activity to radio emission. Star-forming centrals preferentially reside in
haloes with M<10^{12} Msun, central galaxies with optical-AGN activity
typically inhabit haloes with M \sim 10^{13} Msun, and centrals emitting in the
radio mainly reside in haloes more massive than 10^{14} Msun. Although this
seems to suggest that the environment (halo mass) determines the type of
activity of its central galaxy, we find a similar trend with stellar mass:
central star formers typically have stellar masses below 10^{10} Msun, while
optical-AGN hosts and central radio sources have characteristic stellar masses
of 10^{10.8} Msun and 10^{11.6} Msun, respectively. Since more massive haloes
typically host more massive centrals, it is unclear whether the activity of a
central galaxy is causally connected to its stellar mass or to its halo mass.
In general, satellite galaxies have their activity suppressed wrt central
galaxies of the same stellar mass. At fixed stellar mass, we find that the
activity of satellite galaxies depends only weakly on halo mass. In fact, for
satellite galaxies the dependence of galaxy activity on halo mass is more than
four times weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. As we discuss, all these
results are consistent with a picture in which low mass haloes accrete cold
gas, while massive haloes have coronae of hot gas that promote radio activity
of their central galaxies. [Abridged]

large obliquities or be subject to strong obliquity variations. We revisit the
habitability of oblique planets with an energy balance climate model (EBM)
allowing for dynamical transitions to ice-covered snowball states as a result
of ice-albedo feedback. Despite the great simplicity of our EBM, it captures
reasonably well the seasonal cycle of global energetic fluxes at Earth's
surface. It also performs satisfactorily against a full-physics climate model
of a highly oblique Earth-like planet, in an unusual regime of circulation
dominated by heat transport from the poles to the equator. Climates on oblique
terrestrial planets can violate global radiative balance through much of their
seasonal cycle, which limits the usefulness of simple radiative equilibrium
arguments. High obliquity planets have severe climates, with large amplitude
seasonal variations, but they are not necessarily more prone to global snowball
transitions than low obliquity planets. We find that terrestrial planets with
massive CO2 atmospheres, typically expected in the outer regions of habitable
zones, can also be subject to such dynamical snowball transitions. Some of the
snowball climates investigated for CO2-rich atmospheres experience partial
atmospheric collapse. Since long-term CO2 atmospheric build-up acts as a
climatic thermostat for habitable planets, partial CO2 collapse could limit the
habitability of such planets. A terrestrial planet's habitability may thus
depend sensitively on its short-term climatic stability.

the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets. For scattering to occur,
the planets must either form in -- or migrate into -- an unstable
configuration. In either case, it is likely that a residual gas disk, with a
mass comparable to that of the planets, will be present when scattering occurs.
Using explicit hydrodynamic simulations, we study the impact of gas disks on
the outcome of two-planet scattering. We assume a specific model in which the
planets are driven toward instability by gravitational torques from an outer
low mass disk. We find that the accretion of mass and angular momentum that
occurs when a scattered planet impacts the disk can strongly influence the
subsequent dynamics by reducing the number of close encounters. The
eccentricity of the innermost surviving planet at the epoch when the system
becomes Hill stable is not substantially altered from the gas-free case, but
the outer planet is circularized by its interaction with the disk. The
signature of scattering initiated by gas disk migration is thus a high fraction
of low eccentricity planets at larger radii accompanying known eccentric
planets. Subsequent secular evolution of the two planets in the presence of
damping can further damp both eccentricities, and tends to push systems away
from apsidal alignment and toward anti-alignment. We note that the late burst
of accretion when the outer planet impacts the disk is in principle observable,
probably via detection of a strong near-IR excess in systems with otherwise
weak disk and stellar accretion signatures.

data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a
positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to
non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive
combination of individually representable observations is also representable by
the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in
computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the
environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding
magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that
leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We
present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation
data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate
their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source
separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized
by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our
results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target
observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple
simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target
states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also
present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are
extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be
useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also
propose a network for language modeling.

where a top decays to a light quark and a flavor-violating lepton-antilepton
pair. We use an effective operator analysis to place model-independent bounds
on contributions to the decays $t\to u e^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$ and $t\to c e^{\pm}

low-energy processes, and one class with operators where the top quark is a
right-handed singlet and can only contribute to low-energy processes via loop
diagrams. We use $B$ and $K$ decays to place limits on the coefficients of some
of these operators, but find that several remain unconstrained and could

elucidating the transformational properties of the underlying basis functions
and the crucial role of time-reversal invariance. Group theory is used to
derive an invariant expansion of the Hamiltonian for electron states near the K
points of the graphene Brillouin zone. Besides yielding the characteristic
k-linear dispersion and higher-order corrections to it, this approach enables
the systematic incorporation of all terms arising from external electric and
magnetic fields, strain, and spin-orbit coupling up to any desired order.
Several new contributions are found, in addition to reproducing results
obtained previously within tight-binding calculations. Physical ramifications
of these new terms are discussed.

However, the masses for the first two charged leptons come close to the right

sub-TeV gamma-rays are able to arrive from active galaxies at relatively large
distances in spite of expected severe absorption in the extragalactic
background light (EBL). We calculate the gamma-ray spectra at TeV energies from
two example OVV quasars, 3C 273 and 3C 279, assuming that gamma-rays are
injected in the inner parts of the jets launched by the accretion disks. It is
assumed that gamma-rays in the broad energy range (from MeV up to TeV) are
produced in these blazars with the power law spectrum with the spectral index
as observed from these objects by the EGRET telescope at GeV energies. We take
into account the internal absorption of these gamma-rays by considering a few
different models for the radiation field surrounding the jet. The classical
picture of the relativistic blob in jet model for the injection of primary
gamma-rays is considered with the injection rate of gamma-rays as observed by
the EGRET telescope in the GeV energy range. The results of calculations are
compared with positive detection and the upper limits on the sub-TeV gamma-ray
fluxes from these two sources. It is concluded that even with the Stecker EBL
model, the level of the gamma-ray emission from 3C~279 is close to the recent
measurements in the sub-TeV gamma-ray energies provided that the injected
gamma-ray spectrum extends from the GeV energies over the next two decades with
this same spectral index. We also suggest that a few day time scale flare from
3C 273 can be detected by the MAGIC II stereo telescopes.

  Tables",,,,"Technical Report # KU-EC-08-5","stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spatial interaction between two or more classes of points may cause
spatial clustering patterns such as segregation or association, which can be
tested using a nearest neighbor contingency table (NNCT). A NNCT is constructed
using the frequencies of class types of points in nearest neighbor (NN) pairs.
For the NNCT-tests, the null pattern is either complete spatial randomness
(CSR) of the points from two or more classes (called CSR independence) or
random labeling (RL). The distributions of the NNCT-test statistics depend on
the number of reflexive NNs (denoted by $R$) and the number of shared NNs
(denoted by $Q$), both of which depend on the allocation of the points. Hence
$Q$ and $R$ are fixed quantities under RL, but random variables under CSR
independence. Using their observed values in NNCT analysis makes the
distributions of the NNCT-test statistics conditional on $Q$ and $R$ under CSR
independence. In this article, I use the empirically estimated expected values
of $Q$ and $R$ under CSR independence pattern to remove the conditioning of
NNCT-tests (such a correction is called the \emph{QR-adjustment}, henceforth).
I present a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare the conditional NNCT-tests
and QR-adjusted tests under CSR independence and segregation and association
alternatives. I demonstrate that QR-adjustment does not significantly improve
the empirical size estimates under CSR independence and power estimates under
segregation or association alternatives. For illustrative purposes, I apply the
conditional and empirically corrected tests on two example data sets.

of their stars, apparently due to a second stellar generation (SG) in which the
forming gas is enriched by hot-CNO cycled material processed in stars belonging
to a first stellar generation (FG). We propose to use the horizontal branch
(HB) to infer which is today the relative number fraction of ''normal"" and
anomalous stars in clusters. We assume that the anomalies also include enhanced
helium abundance. Helium variations have been recognized to be able to explain
several puzzling peculiarities (gaps, RR Lyr periods and period distribution,
ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails) in HBs. We extend the analysis to as
many clusters as possible. We show that, with few exceptions, 50% or more of
the stars belong to the SG. In other cases, where one would think of a simple
stellar population, we suggest that the stars might all belong to the SG. We
fit the optical and UV data of NGC2808, including a reproduction of the main
sequence splittings and an exam of the problem of ""blue hook"" stars. We also
show a detailed fit of the totally blue HB of M13, one among the clusters that
are possibly fully made up by SG stars. We conclude that the formation of the
SG is a crucial event in the life of GCs. A high fraction of SG stars can be
achieved only if the initial cluster was much more massive than the present one
and most of the FG low mass stars have been lost. As shown by D'Ercole et al.,
the mass loss due to type II supernovae of the FG may be the process
responsible for triggering the expansion of the cluster, the stripping of its
outer layers and the loss of most of the FG low-mass stars.

proposing a simple linear coloring algorithm. Based on these results, we define
a new class of perfect graphs, which we call co-linear graphs, and study their
complement graphs, namely linear graphs. The linear coloring of a graph $G$ is
a vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if
their corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a
clique set of a vertex $u$ is the set of all maximal cliques containing $u$);
the linear chromatic number $\mathcal{\lambda}(G)$ of $G$ is the least integer
$k$ for which $G$ admits a linear coloring with $k$ colors. We show that linear
graphs are those graphs $G$ for which the linear chromatic number achieves its
theoretical lower bound in every induced subgraph of $G$. We prove inclusion
relations between these two classes of graphs and other subclasses of chordal

tests based on NNCTs (i.e., they are NNCT-tests). These tests are designed and
intended for use under the null pattern of random labeling (RL) of completely

for testing segregation against the RL pattern while Dixon's tests are. In this
article, we compare Pielou's and Dixon's NNCT-tests; introduce the one-sided
versions of Pielou's test; extend the use of NNCT-tests for testing complete
spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called
\emph{CSR independence}, henceforth). We assess the finite sample performance
of the tests by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study and demonstrate that
Dixon's tests are also appropriate for testing CSR independence; but Pielou's
test and the corresponding one-sided versions are liberal for testing CSR
independence or RL. Furthermore, we show that Pielou's tests are only

also prove the consistency of the tests under their appropriate null
hypotheses. Moreover, we investigate the edge (or boundary) effects on the
NNCT-tests and compare the buffer zone and toroidal edge correction methods for
these tests. We illustrate the tests on a real life and an artificial data set.

freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate forward in
time. Brane excitations may decay through the emission of bulk gravitons which
may escape to future infinity, leading to a sort of dissipation from the four
dimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Bulk gravitons may also
be reflected off of the curved bulk and reabsorbed by the brane, thereby
transformed into quanta on the brane, leading to a sort of nonlocality from the
four dimensional point of view. The dissipation and the nonlocality are encoded
into the retarded bulk propagator. We estimate the dissipation rates of the
bound state as well as of the matter degrees of freedom at different
cosmological epochs and for different sources of matter on the brane. We use a
