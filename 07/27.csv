evolution of the cosmic UV luminosity density and its sources. Our main
constraint is our measurement of the Lya forest opacity at redshifts 2<z<4.2
from 86 high-resolution quasar spectra. In addition, we impose the requirements
that HI must be reionized by z=6 and HeII by z~3, and consider estimates of the
hardness of the ionizing background from HI to HeII column density ratios. The
derived hydrogen photoionization rate is remarkably flat over the Lya forest
redshift range covered. Because the quasar luminosity function is strongly
peaked near z~2, the lack of redshift evolution indicates that star-forming
galaxies likely dominate the photoionization rate at z>~3. Combined with direct
measurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function, this requires only a small
fraction f_esc~0.5% of galactic hydrogen ionizing photons to escape their
source for galaxies to solely account for the entire ionizing background. Under
the assumption that the galactic UV emissivity traces the star formation rate,
current state-of-the-art observational estimates of the star formation rate
density appear to underestimate the total photoionization rate at z~4 by a
factor ~4, are in tension with recent determinations of the UV luminosity
function, and fail to reionize the Universe by z~6 if extrapolated to
arbitrarily high redshift. A theoretical star formation history peaking earlier
fits the Lya forest photoionization rate well, reionizes the Universe in time,
and is in better agreement with the rate of z~4 gamma-ray bursts observed by
Swift. Quasars suffice to doubly ionize helium by z~3 and likely contribute a
non-negligible and perhaps dominant fraction of the hydrogen ionizing
background at their z~2 peak. [Abridged]

temperature superconductors. We find that Fermi surface reconstruction can
correctly capture the phenomenology of the recent quantum oscillation
experiments that suggest incommensurate order. The predicted frequencies are a
frequency around 530 T arising from the electron pocket, a hole frequency at
around 1650 T, and a new low frequency from a smaller hole pocket at 250 T for
which there are some indications that require further investigation. The
oscillation corresponding to the electron pocket will be further split due to
bilayer coupling but the splitting is sufficiently small to require more
refined measurements. The truly incommensurate $d$-density wave breaks both
time reversal and inversion but the product of these two symmetry operations is
preserved. There is some similarity of our results with the spiral spin density
wave order, which, as pointed out by Overhauser, also breaks time reversal and
inversion. Calculations corresponding to higher order commensuration produces
results similar to anti-phase spin stripes, but appear to us to be an unlikely
explanation of the experiments. The analysis of the Gorkov equation in the
mixed state shows that the oscillation frequencies are unshifted from the
putative normal state and the additional Dingle factor arising from the
presence of the mixed state can provide a subtle distinction between the spiral
spin density wave and the $d$-density wave.

These new hyperfine dressed states manifest themselves in the linear optical
susceptibility of the probe as new resonances in addition to the Autler-Townes

new narrow resonances, whose width are limited only by ground state

in the non-linear regime, when the dynamical reaction of the accelerated
particles on the shock cannot be neglected, are known to show a prominent
energy flux escaping from the shock towards upstream infinity. On physical
grounds, the escape of particles from the upstream region of a shock has to be
expected in all those situations in which the maximum momentum of accelerated
particles, $p_{max}$, decreases with time, as is the case for the Sedov-Taylor
phase of expansion of a shell Supernova Remnant, when both the shock velocity
and the cosmic ray induced magnetization decrease. In this situation, at each
time $t$, particles with momenta larger than $p_{max}(t)$ leave the system from
upstream, carrying away a large fraction of the energy if the shock is strongly
modified by the presence of cosmic rays. This phenomenon is of crucial
importance for explaining the cosmic ray spectrum detected at Earth. In this
paper we discuss how this escape flux appears in the different approaches to
non-linear diffusive shock acceleration, and especially in the quasi-stationary
semi-analytical kinetic ones. We apply our calculations to the Sedov-Taylor
phase of a typical supernova remnant, including in a self-consistent way
particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification and the dynamical reaction
on the shock structure of both particles and fields. Within this framework we
calculate the temporal evolution of the maximum energy reached by the
accelerated particles and of the escape flux towards upstream infinity. The
latter quantity is directly related to the cosmic ray spectrum detected at

amplification due to cosmic ray induced streaming instability, the dynamical
reaction of the amplified magnetic field and the possible effects of turbulent
heating. The approach is specialized to parallel shock waves and the parameters
we chose are the ones appropriate to forward shocks in Supernova Remnants. Our
calculation allows us to show that the net effect of the amplified magnetic
field is to enhance the maximum momentum of accelerated particles while
reducing the concavity of the spectra, with respect to the standard predictions
of NLDSA. This is mainly due to the dynamical reaction of the amplified field
on the shock, which noticeably reduces the modification of the shock precursor.
The total compression factors which are obtained for parameters typical of
supernova remnants are $R_{tot}\sim 7-10$, in good agreement with the values
inferred from observations. The strength of the magnetic field produced through
excitation of streaming instability is found in good agreement with the values
inferred for several remnants if the thickness of the X-ray rims are
interpreted as due to severe synchrotron losses of high energy electrons. We
also discuss the relative role of turbulent heating and magnetic dynamical
reaction in driving the reduction of the precursor modification.

$C_P$, the isothermal compressibility $K_T$, and the isobaric thermal
expansivity $\alpha_P$. At low temperature $T$, we find two distinct maxima in
$C_P$, $K_T$ and $|\alpha_P|$, all converging toward a liquid-liquid critical
point (LLCP) with increasing pressure $P$. We show that the maximum in $C_P$ at
higher $T$ is due to the fluctuations of hydrogen (H) bond formation and that
the second maximum at lower $T$ is due to the cooperativity among the H bonds.
We discuss a similar effect in $K_T$ and $|\alpha_P|$. If this cooperativity
were not taken into account, both the lower-$T$ maximum and the LLCP would
disappear. However, comparison with recent experiments on water hydrating
protein powders provides evidence for the existence of the lower-$T$ maximum,
supporting the hypothesized LLCP at positive $P$ and finite $T$. The model also
predicts that when $P$ moves closer to the critical $P$ the $C_P$ maxima move
closer in $T$ until they merge at the LLCP. Considering that other scenarios
for water are thermodynamically possible, we discuss how an experimental

transition, which incorporates activated hopping processes via the dynamical
theory originally formulated to describe diffusion-jump processes in crystals.
The dynamical-theory approach adapted here to glass-forming liquids treats
hopping as arising from vibrational fluctuations in quasi-arrested state where
particles are trapped inside their cages, and the hopping rate is formulated in
terms of the Debye-Waller factors characterizing the structure of the
quasi-arrested state. The resulting expression for the hopping rate takes an
activated form, and the barrier height for the hopping is ``self-generated'' in
the sense that it is present only in those states where the dynamics exhibits a
well defined plateau. It is discussed how such a hopping rate can be
incorporated into MCT so that the sharp nonergodic transition predicted by the
idealized version of the theory is replaced by a rapid but smooth crossover. We
then show that the developed theory accounts for the breakdown of the
Stokes-Einstein relation observed in a variety of fragile glass formers. It is
also demonstrated that characteristic features of dynamical heterogeneities
revealed by recent computer simulations are reproduced by the theory. More
specifically, a substantial increase of the non-Gaussian parameter, double-peak
structure in the probability distribution of particle displacements, and the
presence of a growing dynamic length scale are predicted by the extended MCT
developed here, which the idealized version of the theory failed to reproduce.
These results of the theory are demonstrated for a model of the Lennard-Jones
system, and are compared with related computer-simulation results and
experimental data.

quantum systems whose semiclassical limits exhibit chaotic dynamics. Recent
computational studies indicate a striking resemblance between the spectrums of

resemblance. We show that each pair of corresponding operators belong to a
common rotation C*-algebra B_\alpha, prove that their spectrums are equal if
\alpha is irrational, and prove that the Hausdorff distance between their
spectrums converges to zero as q increases if \alpha = p/q with p and q coprime
integers. Moreover, we show that corresponding operators in B_\alpha are
homomorphic images of mother operators in the universal rotation C*-algebra
A_\alpha that are unitarily equivalent and hence have identical spectrums.
These results extend analogous results for almost Mathieu operators. We also
utilize the C*-algebraic framework to develop efficient algorithms to compute
the spectrums of these mother operators for rational \alpha and present
preliminary numerical results that support the conjecture that their spectrums
are Cantor sets if \alpha is irrational. This conjecture for almost Mathieu
operators, called the Ten Martini Problem, was recently proved after intensive
efforts over several decades. This proof for the almost Mathieu operators
utilized transfer matrix methods, which do not exist for the kicked operators.
We outline a strategy, based on a special property of loop groups of semisimple
Lie groups, to prove this conjecture for the kicked operators.

models of pinning on a defect line. This class of models includes a number of
well known and much studied systems (like polymer pinning on a defect line,
wetting of interfaces on a disordered substrate and the Poland-Scheraga model
of DNA denaturation). A remarkable aspect is that, in absence of disorder, all
the models in this class are exactly solvable and they display a
localization-delocalization transition that one understands in full detail.
Moreover the behavior of such systems near criticality is controlled by a
parameter and one observes, by tuning the parameter, the full spectrum of
critical behaviors, ranging from first order to infinite order transitions.
This is therefore an ideal set-up in which to address the question of the
effect of disorder on the phase transition,notably on critical properties. We
will review recent results that show that the physical prediction that goes
under the name of Harris criterion is indeed fully correct for pinning models.
Beyond summarizing the results, we will sketch most of the arguments of proof.

to be the maximum number of zeros allowed in the neutrino Yukawa coupling

categories. We investigate certain phenomenological consequences of these
textures within a supersymmetric framework. This is done by using conditions
implied on elements of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix for textures of each
category in $Y_\nu$. These conditions turn out to be stable under radiative
corrections. Including the effective mass, which appears in neutrinoless double
beta decay, along with the usual neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases, it
is shown analytically and through scatter plots how restricted regions in the
seesaw parameter space are selected by these conditions. We also make
consequential statements on the yet unobserved radiative lepton flavor
violating decays such as $\mu \to e \gamma$. All these decay amplitudes are
proportional to the moduli of entries of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix. We
also show under which conditions the low energy CP violation, showing up in
neutrino oscillations, is directly linked to the CP violation required for
producing successful flavor dependent and flavor independent lepton asymmetries
during leptogenesis.

FCRAO data of 12CO 1--0, 13CO 1--0 and far-infrared continuum data observed by

three different line ratios. A first rough estimate of abundance is obtained
from an LTE analysis. To understand the [C I] and CO emission from the PDRs in
IC 348, we use a clumpy PDR model. With an ensemble of identical clumps, we
constrain the total mass from the observed absolute intensities. Then we apply
a more realistic clump distribution model with a power law index of 1.8 for
clump-mass spectrum and a power law index of 2.3 for mass-size relation.
  We provide detailed fits to observations at seven representative positions in
the cloud, revealing clump densities between 4 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 4
10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and C/CO column density ratios between 0.02 and 0.26. The
derived FUV flux from the model fit is consistent with the field calculated
from FIR continuum data, varying between 2 and 100 Draine units across the
cloud. We find that both an ensemble of identical clumps and an ensemble with a
power law clump mass distribution produce line intensities which are in good
agreement (within a factor ~ 2) with the observed intensities. The models
confirm the anti-correlation between the C/CO abundance ratio and the hydrogen
column density found in many regions.

these decays within the framework of QCD factorization. Using an infrared
finite gluon propagator of Cornwall prescription, we find that the time-like
annihilation amplitude could contribute a large strong phase, while the
space-like hard spectator scattering amplitude is real. Numerically, we find
that all the branching ratios and most of the direct CP violations, except
$A_{CP}(B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}\pi^{0})$, agree with the current experimental data
with an effective gluon mass $m_g\simeq0.5 {\rm GeV}$. Taking the unmatched
difference in direct CP violations between $B\to\pi^{0} K^{\pm}$ and
$\pi^{\mp}K^{\pm}$ decays as a hint of new physics, we perform a
model-independent analysis of new physics contributions with a set of
$\bar{s}(1+\gamma_{5})b\otimes\bar{q}(1+\gamma_{5})q$ (q=u,d) operators. Detail
analyses of the relative impacts of the operators are presented in five cases.
Fitting the twelve decay modes, parameter spaces are found generally with
nontrivial weak phases. Our results may indicate that both strong phase from
annihilation amplitude and new weak phase from new physics are needed to
resolve the $\pi K$ puzzle. To further test the new physics hypothesis, the
mixing-induced CP violations in $B\to\pi^{0}K_{S}$ and $\rho^{0}K_{S}$ are
discussed and good agreements with the recent experimental data are found.
