algorithm for data from high resolution, polarization sensitive instruments,
such as the Planck data set. The resulting algorithm, which we call PReBeaM, is
pixel-free and solves for the map directly in spherical harmonic space,
avoiding pixelization artifacts. While Fourier methods like ours are expected
to work best when applied to smooth, large-scale asymmetric beam systematics
(such as far-side lobe effects) we show that our m-truncated spherical harmonic
representation of the beam results in negligible reconstruction error -- even
for m as small as 4 for a polarized elliptically asymmetric beam. We describe a
hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization scheme which allows us to store and
manipulate the time-ordered data from instruments with arbitrary scanning
strategy. Finally, we apply our technique to noisy data and show that it
succeeds in removing visible power spectrum artifacts without generating excess
noise on small scales.

comparing simple theoretical one dimensional hydrostatic loop models with
observations at the temperature and/or density structure along these features.
The most well-known method for dealing with comparisons like that is the
$\chi^2$ approach. In this paper we consider the restrictions imposed by this
approach and present an alternative way for making model comparisons using
Bayesian statistics. In order to quantify our beliefs we use Bayes factors and
information criteria such as AIC and BIC. Three simulated datasets are analyzed
in order to validate the procedure and assess the effects of varying error bar
size. Another two datasets (Ugarte-Urra et al., 2005; Priest et al., 2000) are
re-analyzed using the method described above. In one of these two datasets
(Ugarte-Urra et al., 2005), due to the error estimates in the observed
temperature values, it is not posible to distinguish between the different
heating mechanisms. For this we suggest that both Classical and Bayesian
statistics should be applied in order to make safe assumptions about the nature
of the coronal heating mechanisms.

rigorous formalism and clear physical considerations. In particular, by
explicit calculations based on Maxwell equations only, we show that: (i) the
X-waves exist also inside both the front and the rear part of their double cone
(that has nothing to do with Cherenkov's); (ii) they are to be found not via ad
hoc assumptions, but by use of strict mathematical (or experimental)
procedures; (iii) the ideal X-waves possess infinite energy, but finite-energy
X-waves can be easily constructed (even without space-time truncations): And we
do construct exact finite-energy solutions (totally free from
backward-traveling waves); (iv) an actual attempt at comparing Cherenkov
radiation with X-waves would lead one to consider the very different situation
of the (X-shaped, too) field generated by a superluminal point-charge, a
question exploited in previous papers [Recami et al., PRE 69 (2004) 027602]: We

constant is the underlying ingredient of dark energy. Our profound lack of
understanding of the physics of dark energy places severe constrains on our
ability to say anything about its possible dynamical nature. Quoted errors on
the equation of state, w(z), are so heavily dependent on necessarily
over-simplified parameterisations they are at risk of being rendered
meaningless. Moreover, the existence of degeneracies between the reconstructed
w(z) and the matter and curvature densities weakens any conclusions still
further. We propose consistency tests for the cosmological constant which
provide a direct observational signal if Lambda is wrong, regardless of the
densities of matter and curvature. As an example of its utility, our flat case
test can warn of a small transition from w(z)=-1 of 20% from SNAP quality data
at 4-sigma, even when direct reconstruction techniques see virtually no
evidence for deviation from Lambda. It is shown to successfully rule out a wide
range of non-Lambda dark energy models with no reliance on knowledge of Omega_m

supplementary frequency scale sets the lower border of a high-frequency domain
where the spectral energy grows with a slope which depends, predominantly, upon
the total sound speed of the plasma right after inflation. While the infra-red
region of the graviton energy spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, the expected
signals for typical frequencies larger than 0.01 nHz are hereby analyzed in a
model-independent framework by requiring that the total sound speed of the
post-inflationary plasma be smaller than the speed of light. Current (e.g.
low-frequency) upper limits on the tensor power spectra (determined from the
combined analysis of the three large-scale data sets) are shown to be
compatible with a detectable signal in the frequency range of wide-band
interferometers. In the present context, the scrutiny of the early evolution of

years. My conjecture is that this method works well because mathematicians use
only those predicates to form sets, which yield closed hereditary consistent
predicate extensions. And for every open formula they use in the process of
constructing of a certain (special) set (bottom up), we can always find an
""almost-closed"" formula (i.e. a parameter-free formula with only the free
variable ""x"") which yields the same certain (special) set as predicate
extension as constructed in the bottom up process before. Therefore the use of
predicates with free parameters in the Comprehension Scheme does not cause any
difficulties and can be ""lifted"" by meta-mathematical considerations.

and one generally expects that the statistical properties of the detections
would also be similar after they are scaled to the signal-to-noise ratio of the
underlying observations. I show that this expectation is realized for periods
small compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~
1. At longer periods, the fact that models of astrometric observations must
take account of an extra nuisance parameter causes the mass error to begin
deteriorating at P/T ~ 0.8, as compared to P/T ~ 1.0 for RV. Moreover, the
deterioration is much less graceful. This qualitative difference carries over
to the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored in the
presence of a distant companion that generates an approximately uniform
acceleration. The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all
cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors.
These results imply that to preserve astrometric discovery space at the longest
accessible orbits (which nominally have the lowest-mass sensitivity) requires
supplementary observations to identify or rule out distant companions that
could contribute quasi-uniform acceleration.

formulas. To generate such formulas -- randomly permute all 2^k\binom{n}{k}
possible clauses over the variables x_1, ..., x_n, and starting from the empty
formula, go over the clauses one by one, including each new clause as you go
along if after its addition the formula remains satisfiable. We study the
evolution of this process, namely the distribution over formulas obtained after
scanning through the first m clauses (in the random permutation's order).
  Random processes with conditioning on a certain property being respected are
widely studied in the context of graph properties. This study was pioneered by
Ruci\'nski and Wormald in 1992 for graphs with a fixed degree sequence, and
also by Erd\H{o}s, Suen, and Winkler in 1995 for triangle-free and bipartite
graphs. Since then many other graph properties were studied such as planarity
and H-freeness. Thus our model is a natural extension of this approach to the
satisfiability setting.
  Our main contribution is as follows. For m \geq cn, c=c(k) a sufficiently
large constant, we are able to characterize the structure of the solution space
of a typical formula in this distribution. Specifically, we show that typically
all satisfying assignments are essentially clustered in one cluster, and all
but e^{-\Omega(m/n)} n of the variables take the same value in all satisfying
assignments. We also describe a polynomial time algorithm that finds with high
probability a satisfying assignment for such formulas.

involve the existence of further new particles, in particular paraphotons and

that the reconciliation of the PVLAS particle interpretation implies new low

transistor (GNR-FET). The GNR-FET under consideration is based on a
heterostructure which consists of an array of nanoribbons clad between the
highly conducting substrate (the back gate) and the top gate controlling the dc
and ac source-drain currents. Using the model developed, we derive explicit
analytical formulas for the GNR-FET transconductance as a function of the
signal frequency, collision frequency of electrons, and the top gate length.
The transition from the ballistic and to strongly collisional electron
transport is considered.

to follow their dynamics along a microscopic reaction coordinate (RC) on a
macroscopic time scale, which is beyond the reach of current all atom molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. A practical approach to this inherently multiscale
problem is to model the system as a fictitious overdamped Brownian particle
that diffuses along the RC in the presence of an effective potential of mean
force (PMF) due to the rest of the system. By employing the recently proposed
FR method [I. Kosztin et al., J. of Chem. Phys. 124, 064106 (2006)], which
requires only a small number of fast nonequilibrium MD simulations of the
system in both forward and time reversed directions along the RC, we
reconstruct the PMF: (1) of deca-alanine as a function of its end-to-end
distance, and (2) that guides the motion of potassium ions through the
gramicidin A channel. In both cases the computed PMFs are found to be in good
agreement with previous results obtained by different methods. Our approach
appears to be about one order of magnitude faster than the other PMF
calculation methods and, in addition, it also provides the position dependent
diffusion coefficient along the RC. Thus, the obtained PMF and diffusion
coefficient can be used in a suitable stochastic model to estimate important
characteristics of the studied systems, e.g., the mean folding time of the
stretched deca-alanine and the mean diffusion time of the potassium ion through
gramicidin A.

but also a key resource in quantum information science. The entanglement
content of random pure quantum states is almost maximal; such states find
applications in various quantum information protocols. The preparation of a
random state or, equivalently, the implementation of a random unitary operator,
requires a number of elementary one- and two-qubit gates that is exponential in
the number n_q of qubits, thus becoming rapidly unfeasible when increasing n_q.
On the other hand, pseudo-random states approximating to the desired accuracy
the entanglement properties of true random states may be generated efficiently,
that is, polynomially in n_q. In particular, quantum chaotic maps are efficient
generators of multipartite entanglement among the qubits, close to that
expected for random states. This review discusses several aspects of the
relationship between entanglement, randomness and chaos. In particular, I will
focus on the following items: (i) the robustness of the entanglement generated
by quantum chaotic maps when taking into account the unavoidable noise sources
affecting a quantum computer; (ii) the detection of the entanglement of
high-dimensional (mixtures of) random states, an issue also related to the
question of the emergence of classicality in coarse grained quantum chaotic
dynamics; (iii) the decoherence induced by the coupling of a system to a
chaotic environment, that is, by the entanglement established between the
system and the environment.

of the 158 micron [CII] line with the far-infrared luminosity in extragalactic
sources stems from a stronger contribution from the heated dust emission in the
more distant sources. Due to the flux limited nature of these surveys, the
luminosity of the detected objects increases with distance. However, the [CII]
luminosity does not climb as steeply as that of the far-infrared, giving the
decline in the L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio with L_FIR. Investigating this further, we
find that the [CII] luminosity exhibits similar drops as measured against the
carbon monoxide and radio continuum luminosities. The former may indicate that
at higher luminosities a larger fraction of the carbon is locked up in the form
of molecules and/or that the CO line radiation also contributes to the cooling,
done mainly by the [CII] line at low luminosities. The latter hints at
increased activity in these galaxies at greater distances, so we suggest that,
in addition to an underlying heating of the dust by a stellar population, there
is also heating of the embedded dusty torus by the ultra-violet emission from
the active nucleus, resulting in an excess in the far-infrared emission from
the more luminous objects.

  The arithmetic Atiyah extension","This version is revised according to the remarks of the referee",,,,"math.AG math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous paper, we have defined arithmetic extension groups in the
context of Arakelov geometry. In the present one, we introduce an arithmetic
analogue of the Atiyah extension that defines an element -- the arithmetic
Atiyah class -- in a suitable arithmetic extension group. If $\overline{E}$ is
a hermitian vector bundle on an arithmetic scheme $X$, its arithmetic Atiyah
class is an obstruction to the algebraicity of the unitary connection on the
vector bundle $E_\C$ over the complex manifold $X(\C)$ that is compatible with
its holomorphic structure.
  We develop basic properties of the arithmetic Atiyah class and study its
vanishing in the case of hermitian line bundles. This may be translated into a
concrete problem of diophantine geometry, concerning rational points of the
universal vector extension of the Picard variety of $X$. We investigate this
problem, which was already considered and solved in some cases by Bertrand, by
using a classical transcendence result of Schneider-Lang, and we derive a
finiteness result.
  We also consider a geometric analog of our arithmetic situation, namely a
smooth, projective variety $X$ which is fibered on a curve $C$ defined over
some field $k$ of characteristic zero. To any line bundle $L$ over $X$ is
attached its relative Atiyah class ${\rm at}_{X/C}L$. We describe precisely
when this class vanishes. In particular, when the fixed part of the relative
Picard variety of $X$ over $C$ is trivial, this holds only when the restriction
of $L$ to the generic fiber $X_K$ of $X$ over $C$ is a torsion line bundle.

this new, deeper map we extract the pre-stellar cores from the data. We use
updated values for the distance to the cloud complex, and also for the internal
temperatures of the pre-stellar cores to generate an updated core mass function
(CMF). This updated CMF is consistent with previous results in so far as they
went, but our deeper map gives an improved completeness limit of 0.1 Mo (0.16
Jy), which enables us to show that a turnover exists in the low-mass regime of
the CMF. The L1688 CMF shows the same form as the stellar IMF and can be mapped
onto the stellar IMF, showing that the IMF is determined at the prestellar core
stage. We compare L1688 with the Orion star-forming region and find that the
turnover in the L1688 CMF occurs at a mass roughly a factor of two lower than
the CMF turnover in Orion. This suggests that the position of the CMF turnover

know which operational principles make it so. All axiomatization attempts
suffer at least one postulate of a mathematical nature. Here I will analyze the
possibility of deriving QM as the mathematical representation of a ""fair
operational framework"", i.e. a set of rules which allows the experimenter to
make predictions on future ""events"" on the basis of suitable ""tests"", e.g.
without interference from uncontrollable sources. Two postulates need to be
satisfied by any fair operational framework: NSF: ""no-signaling from the
future""--for the possibility of making predictions on the basis of past tests;
PFAITH: ""existence of a preparationally faithful state""--for the possibility of
preparing any state and calibrating any test. I will show that all theories
satisfying NSF admit a C*-algebra representation of events as linear
transformations of effects. Based on a very general notion of dynamical
independence, it is easy to see that all such probabilistic theories are
""non-signaling without interaction"" (""non-signaling"" for short)--another
requirement for a fair operational framework. Postulate PFAITH then implies the
""local observability principle"", the tensor-product structure for the linear
spaces of states and effects, the impossibility of bit commitment and
additional features, such an operational definition of transpose, a scalar
product for effects, weak-selfduality of the theory, and more. Dual to
Postulate PFAITH an analogous postulate for effects would give additional
quantum features, such as teleportation. However, all possible consequences of
these postulates still need to be investigated, and it is not clear yet if we

transition at $z\c=2$ above which one box contains an extensive number of

$\beta=1$, motivating us to study the same model on the Bethe lattice. Here we

ordering transition with a conventional mean field order parameter exponent
$\beta=1/2$, but with the region where this behaviour is observable shrinking
in size as $1/\mu$ in the mean field limit of large $\mu$. We show that the
behaviour in the transition region can also be understood directly within a
mean field approach, by making the assignment of minima `soft'. Finally we
demonstrate, in the simplest mean field case, how the analysis can be
generalized to include both maxima and minima. In this case an additional first

logW/nu = -4.75 (W: equivalent width, nu: wavenumber) above which the observed
lines do not follow the line formation theory based on the classical
micro-turbulent model and that the abundance analysis can be done only with the
lines of logW/nu < -4.75. The C, O, and their isotopic abundances determined
from such weak lines of CO and OH in 23 K - M giants are roughly consistent
with the predictions of evolutionary models. However, the stronger lines of
logW/nu > -4.75 cannot be analyzed at all by the classical line formation
theory. From the behavior of these lines and considering other observations
such as the detections of H2O lines, not only in the late M giants but also in
the early M and K giants, we found that these lines are badly disturbed by the
contamination from extra molecular layers. We already know that the very strong
lines of logW/nu > -4.4 are contaminated by the contribution from the extra
warm molecular layers, but we now show that such contamination should be
prevailing not only in the strong low excitation lines but also in the
intermediate-strength lines (-4.75 < logW/nu > -4.4) as well. The reason why
these lines cannot be used for determining photospheric abundances is simply
because they include the contamination of the non-photospheric origin. Instead
they can be new proves of the warm molecular envelope for which little is known
yet. An important conclusion is that the infrared spectra of K - M giants are a
hybrid of at least two components originating in the photosphere and the warm
molecular envelope. In the interpretation and analysis of the infrared spectra
of cool luminous stars, it is essential to keep their hybrid naure in mind.

results from an intermittent synchronization, and Mode C corresponds to the

SHARP I at the ESO 3.5m NTT and adaptive optics observation with ADONIS at the
ESO 3.6m telescope, all in the near-infrared bands JHK obtained in the years
1995, 2000, and 2001.
  We found 13 new binaries among the young stars in CrA between 0.13 arcsec
(the diffraction limit) and 6 arcsec (set as an upper separation limit to avoid
contamination by chance alignments). While most multiples in CrA are binaries,
there are also one quadruple (TY CrA), and one triple (HR 7170) which may form
a quintuple together with the binary HR 7169. One of the newly detected
companions with a large magnitude difference found near the M3-5 type T Tauri
star [MR 81] Ha 17 could be a brown dwarf or an infrared companion with an
edge-on disk. Among seven Herbig Ae/Be stars in CrA, six are multiple.
  The multiplicity frequency in CrA is as high as in similar star forming
regions. By comparing with the period distribution of main-sequence stars and
extrapolating to separations not probed in this survey, we conclude that the
companion-star frequency is 95+/-23 %; i.e. the average number of companions
per primary is 0.95.

shown to acquire a steady state mean velocity at asymptotically large time

grows proportionally with time, $t$, allowing for calculating the steady state
diffusion coefficient $D$ which, interestingly, shows a peaking behaviour
around the same $F_0$. The ratchet current, however, turns out to be largely
coherent. At intermediate time scales, which bridge the small time scale

literature, where the effects of magnetic fields, radiative cooling and thermal
conduction have been considered. However, the formation of fully developed
turbulence has often been prevented by the artificial viscosity inherent in
hydrodynamical simulations, and a uniform post-shock flow has been assumed in
all previous single-cloud studies. In reality, the flow behind the shock is
also likely to be turbulent, with non-uniform density, pressure and velocity
structure created as the shock sweeps over inhomogenities upstream of the
cloud. To address these twin issues we use a sub-grid compressible k-epsilon
turbulence model to estimate the properties of the turbulence generated in
shock-cloud interactions and the resulting increase in the transport
coefficients that the turbulence brings. A detailed comparison with the output
from an inviscid hydrodynamical code puts these new results into context.
  We find that cloud destruction in inviscid and k-epsilon models occurs at
roughly the same speed when the post-shock flow is smooth and when the density
contrast between the cloud and inter-cloud medium is less than 100. However,
there are increasing and significant differences as this contrast increases.
Clouds subjected to strong ``buffeting'' by a highly turbulent post-shock
environment are destroyed significantly quicker. Additional calculations with
an inviscid code where the post-shock flow is given random, grid-scale, motions
confirms the more rapid destruction of the cloud.
  Our results clearly show that turbulence plays an important role in
shock-cloud interactions, and that environmental turbulence adds a new
dimension to the parameter space which has hitherto been studied (abridged).

ring is called stable, if it admits a certain degree bound on the sums of
squares in the representation of polynomials. Stability, first defined
explicitly by Powers and Scheiderer, is a very useful property. It often
implies that the quadratic module is closed; furthermore it helps settling the
Moment Problem, solves the Membership Problem for quadratic modules and allows
applications of methods from optimization to represent nonnegative polynomials.
  We provide sufficient conditions for finitely generated quadratic modules in
real polynomial rings of several variables to be stable. These conditions can
be checked easily. For a certain class of semi-algebraic sets, we obtain that
the nonexistence of bounded polynomials implies stability of every
corresponding quadratic module. As stability often implies the non-solvability
of the Moment Problem, this complements Schmuedgen's result which uses bounded
polynomials to check the solvability of the Moment Problem by dimensional
induction.
  We also use stability to generalize a result on the Invariant Moment Problem

the objects of study are the {\it Riemannian} metrics (and their time

the gauge properties that the space Riem(M) of all metrics over $M$ possesses,
specially as they relate to the constraints of geometrodynamics. For instance,
the Hamiltonian constraint does not generate a group, and it is thus hard to
view its action in Riem(M) in a gauge setting. However, in view of the recent
results representing GR as a dual theory, invariant under foliation preserving
3--diffeomorphisms and 3D conformal transformations, but not under
refoliations, we are justified in considering the gauge structure pertaining
only to the groups $\mathcal{D}$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$, and $\mathcal{C}$,
of conformal diffeomorphisms on $M$. For these infinite-dimensional symmetry
groups, Riem(M) has a natural principal fiber bundle (PFB) structure, which
renders the gravitational field amenable to the full range of gauge-theoretic
treatment. We discuss some of these structures and construct explicit formulae
for supermetric-induced gauge connections. To apply the formalism, we compute
general properties for a specific connection bearing strong resemblance to the
one naturally induced by the deWitt supermetric, showing it has desirable
relationalist properties. Finally, we find that the group of conformal
diffeomorphisms solves the pathologies inherent in the $\DD$ group and also
brings it closer to Horava gravity and the dual conformal theory called Shape
Dynamics.

time-reversal the fermion field transforms like a Dirac spinor but has a
non-standard parity transformation. This implements the property that magnetic
charge, unlike electric charge, is parity-odd. A consequence of the

this critical region, the fullerene system is seen to continuously oscillate
between the carbon cage (the solid phase) and the state of carbon dimers and
short chains (the gas phase). These oscillations correspond to consecutive
disintegration and formation of the fullerene. Furthermore, the
temperature-dependent heat capacity of the fullerene features a prominent peak,
signifying the finite system analogue of a first-order phase transition. The
simulations were conducted for 500 ns using a topologically-constrained

frequency entangled photons with continuous frequency detunings. The principle
of anti-symmetrisation of the spatial part of a wavefunction and subsequent
detection of hidden entanglement via anti-bunching at a beamsplitter may
facilitate the observation of entanglement in other systems, like atomic
ensembles or Bose-Einstein condensates. The analogue for fermionic systems
would be to observe bunching.

obtained temperature of the droplet the interrelated nonsteady vapour

formulate the law in accordance with which the droplet is growing in diffusion

accretion onto supermassive black holes located at their centres. The paradigm
that the nuclei of inactive galaxies are also occupied by black holes was

by the discovery of giant-amplitude, non-recurrent X-ray flares from such
inactive galaxies and explained in terms of outburst radiation from stars
tidally disrupted by a dormant supermassive black hole at the nuclei of those
galaxies. Due to the scarcity of detected tidal disruption events, the
confirmation and follow-up of each new candidate is needed to strengthen the
theory through observational data, as well as to shed new light on the
characteristics of this type of events. Two tidal disruption candidates have
been detected with XMM-Newton during slew observations. Optical and X-ray
follow-up, post-outburst observations were performed on these highly variable
objects in order to further study their classification and temporal evolution.
We show that the detected low-state X-ray emission for these two candidates has
properties such that it must still be related to the flare. The X-ray
luminosity of the objects decreases according to theoretical predictions for
tidal disruption events. At present, optical spectra of the sources do not
present any evident signature of the disruption event. In addition, the tidal
disruption rate as derived from the XMM-Newton slew survey has been computed

diffusive systems interacting with boundary reservoirs and under the action of
external fields. The approach is based on simple postulates which are suggested
by a wide class of microscopic stochastic models where they are satisfied. The
description however does not refer in any way to an underlying microscopic
dynamics: the only input required are transport coefficients as functions of
thermodynamic variables, which are experimentally accessible. The basic
postulates are local equilibrium which allows a hydrodynamic description of the
evolution, the Einstein relation among the transport coefficients, and a
variational principle defining the out of equilibrium free energy. Associated
to the variational principle there is a Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by
the free energy, very useful for concrete calculations. Correlations over a
macroscopic scale are, in our scheme, a generic property of nonequilibrium

nuclei in the framework of the Interacting Boson Approximation (IBA) model have
focused on finite boson numbers, corresponding to valence nucleon pairs in
specific nuclei. Attention to large boson numbers has been motivated by the
study of shape/phase transitions from one limiting symmetry of IBA to another,
which become sharper in the large boson number limit, revealing in parallel
regularities previously unnoticed, although they survive to a large extent for
finite boson numbers as well. Several of these regularities will be discussed.
It will be shown that in all of the three limiting symmetries of the IBA [U(5),
SU(3), and O(6)], energies of 0+ states grow linearly with their ordinal
number. Furthermore, it will be proved that the narrow transition region
separating the symmetry triangle of the IBA into a spherical and a deformed
region is described quite well by the degeneracies E(0_2^+)=E(6_1^+), E(0_3^+)
=E(10_1^+), E(0_4^+)=E(14_1^+), the energy ratio E(6_1^+) /E(0_2^+) turning out
to be a simple, empirical, easy-to-measure effective order parameter,
distinguishing between first- and second-order transitions. The energies of 0+
states near the point of the first order shape/phase transition between U(5)
and SU(3) will be shown to grow as n(n+3), where n is their ordinal number, in
agreement with the rule dictated by the relevant critical point symmetries
studied in the framework of special solutions of the Bohr Hamiltonian. The
underlying dynamical and quasi-dynamical symmetries are also discussed.

  Higgs model with T-parity","13 pages, 3 figures","Phys.Rev.D78:075017,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.78.075017",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) new flavor-changing
interactions between mirror fermions and the Standard Model (SM) fermions can
induce various FCNC decays for B-mesons, Z-boson and Higgs boson. Since all
these decays induced in the LHT model are correlated, we in this work perform a
collective study for these decays, namely the Z-boson decay Z -> b s_bar, the
Higgs boson decay h -> b s_bar, and the B-meson decays B -> X_s \gamma, B_s ->
\mu^+\mu^- and B -> X_s \mu^+ \mu^-. We find that under the current
experimental constraints from the B-decays, the branching ratios of both Z -> b
s_bar and h -> b s_bar can still deviate from the SM predictions significantly.
In the parameter space allowed by the B-decays, the branching ratio of Z -> b
s_bar can be enhanced to 10^{-7} (about one order above the SM prediction)
while h -> b s_bar can be much suppressed relative to the SM prediction (about
one order below the SM prediction).

nothing but fundamental quantum excitations at the Planck scale is a
long-standing challenge to theoretical physicists. A candidate theory of
quantum gravity which achieves this goal without invoking exotic ingredients or
excessive fine-tuning is based on the nonperturbative and
background-independent technique of Causal Dynamical Triangulations. We
demonstrate in detail how in this approach a macroscopic de Sitter universe,
accompanied by small quantum fluctuations, emerges from the full gravitational
path integral, and how the effective action determining its dynamics can be
reconstructed uniquely from Monte Carlo data. We also provide evidence that it
may be possible to penetrate to the sub-Planckian regime, where the Planck
length is large compared to the lattice spacing of the underlying
regularization of geometry.

coupled real conservation equations, in Euclidean spacetime in the free case
and in a five-dimensional Eisenhart geometry in the presence of an external
potential. This implies a novel two-phase quantum hydrodynamic model whose
Lagrangian picture provides an exact scheme to calculate the time-dependent
wavefunction from a continuum of deterministic trajectories where two points
are linked by at most two orbits. Properties of the model are examined,
including the appearance of entangled trajectories in separable states.
Wavefunction constructions employing alternative two-phase models are proposed.
