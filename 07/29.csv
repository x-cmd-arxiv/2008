experimental resolution of the Gibbs paradox: both the thermodynamic entropy of

ideal mixtures. Information loss is the driving force of these spontaneous
processes. Information is defined as the amount of the compressed data.
Information losses due to dynamic motion and static symmetric structure
formation are defined as two kinds of entropies - dynamic entropy and static
entropy, respectively. There are three laws of information theory, where the
first and the second laws are analogs of the two thermodynamic laws. However,
the third law of information theory is different: for a solid structure of
perfect symmetry (e.g., a perfect crystal), the entropy (static entropy for
solid state) S is the maximum. More generally, a similarity principle is set
up: if all the other conditions remain constant, the higher the similarity
among the components is, the higher the value of entropy of the mixture (for
fluid phases) or the assemblage (for a static structure or a system of
condensed phases) or any other structure (such as quantum states in quantum
mechanics) will be, the more stable the mixture or the assemblage will be, and
the more spontaneous the process leading to such a mixture or an assemblage or

in our everyday life. Despite its central role, the growth and the development
of the WWW is not controlled by any central authority. This situation has
created a huge ensemble of connections whose complexity can be fruitfully
described and quantified by network theory. One important application that
allows to sort out the information present in these connections is given by the
PageRank alghorithm. Computation of this quantity is usually made iteratively
with a large use of computational time. In this paper we show that the PageRank
can be expressed in terms of a wave function obeying a Schroedinger-like
equation. In particular the topological disorder given by the unbalance of
outgoing and ingoing links between pages, induces wave function and potential
structuring. This allows to directly localize the pages with the largest score.
Through this new representation we can now compute the PageRank without
iterative techniques. For most of the cases of interest our method is faster
than the original one. Our results also clarify the role of topology in the
diffusion of information within complex networks. The whole approach opens the
possibility to novel techniques inspired by quantum physics for the analysis of

generated free nilpotent group must be very short.
  Let F_{n,c} denote a free nilpotent group of finite rank n at least two and
of nilpotency class c at least two. In 1976 Dyer and Formanek proved that the
automorphism group of F_{n,2} is even complete (and hence the height of the
aumorphism tower of F_{n,2} is two) provided that n is not three; in the case
when n=3, the height of the automorphism tower of F_{n,2} is three. The author
proved in 2001 that the automorphism group of any infinitely generated free
nilpotent of class two is complete.
  In his Ph. D. thesis (2003) Kassabov found an upper bound u(n,c) (a natural
number) for the height of the automorphism tower of F_{n,c} in terms of n and
c, thereby finally proving Baumslag's conjecture. By analyzing the function
u(n,c), one can conclude that if c is small compared to n, then the height of
the automorphism tower of F_{n,c} is at most three.
  The main result of the present paper states that the automorphism group of
any infinitely generated free nilpotent group of nilpotency class at least two
is complete. Thus the automorphism tower of any free nilpotent group terminates
after finitely many steps.

the large boson number limit, revealing previously unnoticed regularities,
which also survive to a large extent for finite boson numbers, corresponding to
valence nucleon pairs in collective nuclei. It is shown that energies of 0_n^+
states grow linearly with their ordinal number n in all three limiting
symmetries of IBA [U(5), SU(3), and O(6)]. Furthermore, it is proved that the
narrow transition region separating the symmetry triangle of the IBA into a
spherical and a deformed region is described quite well by the degeneracies
E(0_2^+)=E(6_1^+), E(0_3^+)=E(10_1^+), E(0_4^+)=E(14_1^+), while the energy
ratio E(6_1^+) /E(0_2^+) turns out to be a simple, empirical, easy-to-measure

  note: text overlap with arXiv:quant-ph/0201143 by other authors",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, I look at the role of quantum entanglement in mixed-state
quantum computation. The model we consider is the DQC1 or `power of one qubit'
model. I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical
instance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount
of entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply
that the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)
algorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential
classical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and
the amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I
suggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance
of the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction
of the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an
interpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state
quantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent
interest. Its role in the phenomenon of entanglement distribution is studied
through an easily comprehensible example.
  This thesis also contains discussions on the relation between the complexity
classes P, BQP and DQC1. Additional material is presented on the connections
between the DQC1 model, Jones polynomials and statistical mechanics. The thesis
concludes with a discussion of a few open problems related to the DQC1 model,
the quantum discord and their scope in quantum information science.

involve recasting the spin transform on the two-sphere S^2 as a Fourier

compute Fourier coefficients, which are related to spherical harmonic
coefficients through a linear transform. By recasting the problem as a Fourier

develop spherical harmonic transforms that are theoretically exact for
band-limited functions, thereby providing an alternative sampling theorem on
the sphere. The computational complexity of our forward and inverse spin
spherical harmonic transforms scale as O(L^3) for any arbitrary spin number,

Numerical experiments are performed and unfortunately the forward transform is
found to be unstable for band-limits above L~32. The instability is due to the

overdamped behaviour for higher temperatures T>T*. We have investigated in
detail the behaviour of Josephson junctions around the temperature T* by using
Monte Carlo simulations including retrapping from the running state into the
supercurrent state as given by the model of Ben-Jacob et al. We develop
discussion of the important role of multiple escape and retrapping events in
the moderate-damping regime, in particular considering the behaviour in the
region close to T*. We show that the behaviour is more fully understood by
considering two crossover temperatures, and that the shape of the distribution
and s(T) around T*, as well as at lower T<T*, are largely determined by the
shape of the conventional thermally activated switching distribution. We show
that the characteristic temperatures T* are not unique for a particular
Josephson junction, but have some dependence on the ramp rate of the applied
bias current. We also consider hysteresis in moderately damped Josephson
junctions and discuss the less commonly measured distribution of return
currents for a decreasing current ramp. We find that some hysteresis should be
expected to persist above T* and we highlight the importance, even well below
T*, of accounting properly for thermal fluctuations when determining the
damping parameter Q.

aggregation of specialized membrane-bound proteins into a coat able to curve
cell membranes. The nucleation and growth of a protein coat is a kinetic
process that competes with the energy-consuming turnover of coat components
between the membrane and the cytosol. We propose a generic kinetic description
of coat assembly and the formation of coated vesicles, and discuss its
implication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and
with the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area
emerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat
components, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments.
We further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly
sensitive switching mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing
membrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics. We claim that the
existence of this switching behaviour, also triggered by factors such as the
presence of cargo and variation of the membrane mechanical tension, allows for
efficient regulation of vesicle secretion. We propose a model, supported by
different experimental observations, in which vesiculation of secretory
membranes is impaired by the energy consuming desorption of coat proteins,
until the presence of cargo or other factors triggers a dynamical switch into a
vesicle producing state.

scaling of the second moment of particle displacements. However, FLR effects
seem to eliminate this transition. The PDFs of trapping and flight events show
clear evidence of algebraic scaling with decay exponents depending on the value

requires knowledge of the relation between macroscopic parameters and the force
felt by a particle in response to displacements. We investigate this response
function for a spherical particle using the two-fluid model, in which the gel
is represented by a polymer network coupled to a surrounding solvent via a drag
force. We obtain an analytic solution for the response function in the limit of
small volume fraction of the polymer network, and neglecting inertial effects.
We use no-slip boundary conditions for the solvent at the surface of the
sphere. The boundary condition for the network at the surface of the sphere is
a kinetic friction law, for which the tangential stress of the network is
proportional to relative velocity of the network and the sphere. This boundary
condition encompasses both no-slip and frictionless boundary conditions as
limits. Far from the sphere there is no relative motion between the solvent and
network due to the coupling between them. However, the different boundary
conditions on the solvent and network tend to produce different far-field
motions. We show that the far field motion and the force on the sphere are
controlled by the solvent boundary conditions at high frequency and by the
network boundary conditions at low frequency. At low frequencies compression of
the network can also affect the force on the sphere. We find the crossover
frequencies at which the effects of sliding of the sphere past the polymer
network and compression of the gel become important.

inviscid miscible mixture of fluids without chemical reactions or diffusion.
Our work leads to the equations of motion in an universal thermodynamic form in
which interaction terms subject to constitutive laws, difficult to interpret
physically, do not occur. For an internal energy function of densities,
entropies and spatial gradients, an equation describing the barycentric motion
of the constituents is obtained. The result is extended for dissipative
mixtures and an equation of energy is obtained. A form of Clausius-Duhem's
inequality which represents the second law of thermodynamics is deduced. In the
particular case of compressible mixtures, the equations reproduce the classical
results. Far from critical conditions, the interfaces between different phases
in a mixture of fluids are layers with strong gradients of density and entropy.
The surface tension of such interfaces is interpreted.

determined from the relative strengths of the H3+ lines, are T=200-300K and
n=50-200cm^-3. The detection of high column densities of H3+ toward all eight
stars implies that this warm and diffuse gaseous environment is widespread in
the CMZ. The products of the ionization rate and path length for these sight
lines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense and diffuse clouds in the
Galactic disk, respectively, indicating that the ionization rate, zeta, is not
less than 10^-15 s^-1 and that L is at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm
and diffuse gas is an important component of the CMZ, in addition to the three
previously known gaseous environments: (1) cold molecular clouds observed by
radio emission of CO and other molecules, (2) hot (T=10^4-10^6K) and highly
ionized diffuse gas (n_e=10-100cm^-3) seen in radio recombination lines, far

unique in showing an additional H3+ absorption component, which is interpreted

weakly coupled pQCD and strongly coupled AdS/CFT models of quark gluon plasma
dynamics in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.
These models are shown to predict qualitatively different associated hadron
correlations with respect to tagged heavy quark jets. While both models feature
similar far zone Mach and diffusion wakes, the far zone stress features are
shown to be too weak to survive thermal broadening at hadron freeze-out.
However, these models differ significantly in a near zone ""Neck"" region where
strong chromo-fields sourced by the heavy quark jet couple to the polarizable
plasma. Conical associated correlations, if any, are shown to be dominated by
the jet induced transverse flow in the Neck zone and unrelated to the weak far
zone wakes. Unlike in AdS/CFT, we show that the induced transverse flow in the
Neck zone is too weak in pQCD to produce conical correlations after Cooper-Frye
freeze-out. The observation of conical correlations violating Mach's law would

central galaxies. In order to measure the kinematics with sufficient
signal-to-noise, one uses the satellite galaxies of a large number of central
galaxies stacked according to similar properties (e.g., luminosity). However,
in general the relation between the luminosity of a central galaxy and the mass
of its host halo will have non-zero scatter. Consequently, this stacking
results in combining the kinematics of satellite galaxies in haloes of
different masses, which complicates the interpretation of the data. In this
paper we present an analytical framework to model satellite kinematics,
properly accounting for this scatter and for various selection effects. We show
that in the presence of scatter in the halo mass-luminosity relation, the
commonly used velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies can not be used to
infer a unique halo mass-luminosity relation. In particular, we demonstrate
that there is a degeneracy between the mean and the scatter of the halo
mass-luminosity relation. We present a new technique that can break this
degeneracy, and which involves measuring the velocity dispersions using two
different weighting schemes: host-weighting (each central galaxy gets the same
weight) and satellite-weighting (each central galaxy gets a weight proportional
to its number of satellites). The ratio between the velocity dispersions
obtained using these two weighting schemes is a strong function of the scatter
in the halo mass-luminosity relation, and can thus be used to infer a unique
relation between light and mass from the kinematics of satellite galaxies.

matter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosity
relation (MLR) of their corresponding central galaxies. In this paper we select
a large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite
galaxies as a function of the $r$-band luminosity of the central galaxies.
Using the analytical framework presented in Paper I, we use these data to infer
{\it both} the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully
taking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking
procedure. As expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massive
haloes. In addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of a
given luminosity, $\sigma_{\log M}$, also increases with increasing luminosity.
As we demonstrate, this is consistent with $\sigma_{\log L}$, which reflects
the scatter in the conditional probability function $P(L_c|M)$, being
independent of halo mass. Our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields
$\sigma_{\log L}=0.16\pm0.04$, in excellent agreement with constraints from
clustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analytical
model of galaxy formation. We thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity in
galaxy formation, which is characterized by $\sigma_{\log L}$, is well
constrained, is independent of halo mass, and is in good agreement with current
models of galaxy formation.

five independent components of a jet that are characterized by slightly

used to explain the emission of the source at long time scales. This component
dominates the emission in the X-ray range, whereas the other components are
dominant in the TeV range. The model used for our simulation describes
precisely the evolution of the particle energy spectrum inside each component

analyze the variation in these distributions with radius and provide an SED in
the four IRAC bands: 3.6 microns, 4.5 microns, 5.8 microns and 8.0 microns. We
fit the radial profiles of the 3.6 micron band to r^.25 and exponential
profiles to evaluate the structure of the remnant. Finally, we compare the IRAC
images with multi-wavelength data and examine how outflows in the X-ray, Halpha
and CO correlate with 8 micron emission. The results support the general
picture of NGC 6240 as a system experiencing a major merger and transitioning
from a disk galaxy to a spheroid. The sensitivity of IRAC to low surface
brightness mid-infrared features provides detailed information on the extended
distributions of stars and dust in this rare system.

amount of information it is possible to send through various types of
communication channels, and to understand the encoding methods that will allow
one to achieve such limits. An early surprise in the study of \textit{quantum}
information theory was the discovery of dense coding, which demonstrated that
it is possible to achieve higher rates for communicating classical information
by transmitting quantum systems, rather than classical ones. To achieve the
highest possible rate, the transmitted quantum system must initially be
maximally entangled with another that is held by the receiver, and the sender
can achieve this rate by encoding her messages with unitary operations. The
situation where these two systems are not maximally entangled has been
intensively studied in recent years, and to date it has appeared as though
unitary encoding might well be optimal in all cases. Indeed, this optimality of
unitary operations for quantum communication protocols has been found to hold
under far more general conditions, extending well beyond the special case of
dense coding. Nonetheless, we here present strong numerical evidence supported
by analytical arguments that indicate there exist circumstances under which one
can encode strictly more classical information using dense coding with
non-unitary, as opposed to unitary, operations.

(LSC-DFT) for tunneling transport with full electron-electron interactions.
Quantum-kinetic (Dyson) equations are used for an exact reformulation that
expresses the variational noninteracting and interacting many-body scattering

observations of the galaxy cluster A3158 (z=0.0597) which is located within the
central part of the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster (HRS). Spectroscopic data
for the central part of the HRS suggest that A3158 is in a dynamically
important position within the supercluster and that it is moving toward the
double cluster system A3125/A3128 which marks the centre of the HRS. A total of
110 radio galaxies are detected in a 35 arcminute radius about the cluster at
1.4 GHz, of which 30 are also detected at 2.5 GHz.We examine the source counts
and compute the Radio Luminosity Function (RLF) at 1.4 GHz from the subset of
88 sources found within the fullwidth half-power area of the ATCA beam.
Comparison of the source counts in the area over the background, as computed by
Prandoni et al. (2001), shows some evidence of an excess of galaxies with
L(1.4) GHz < 2 x 10^22 W/Hz. This result seems to indicate a star forming
population and is a result similar to that found recently by Owen et al. (2005)
for the merging cluster A2125. In addition we find that the radio luminosity
function for early-type galaxies (E and S0) below log P(1.4) = 22.5 is lower
than that found for a composite cluster environment (Ledlow & Owen, 1996) but
is similar to the early-type RLF for clusters in the centre of the Shapley
Super cluster (Venturi et al. 2000) which are believed to be in the latter
stages of merging. This result implies that the cores of superclusters are
environments where radio emission, particularly resultant from AGN, is
suppressed in the later stages of merging. Thus, radio observations of clusters
might be sensitive indicators of the precise merger stage of the cluster but
more observational evidence is still required to establish this trend.

outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. MEMS storage devices, however, are
much different from magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics.
They have thousands of heads called probe tips and provide the following two
major access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of probe tips
for accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data
with the set of probe tips selected. Due to these characteristics, it is
nontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS
storage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the
Region-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data
retrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical
MEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based
on the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and
two-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental results
show that the proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance
by up to 4.0 times for relational data and by up to 4.8 times for
two-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of
existing data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more
marked as the database size grows.

unknown signal $x$ from a series of samples. A prevalent assumption which often
guarantees recovery from the given measurements is that $x$ lies in a known
subspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured
signal models, in which $x$ lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper we
develop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals
from a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which $x$
lies in a sum of $k$ subspaces, chosen from a larger set of $m$ possibilities.
The samples are modelled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling
functions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that
our problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose
non-zero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed
$\ell_2/\ell_1$ program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an
equivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed
to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block
restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard
RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP we also
prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modelling errors.
  A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement
vectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this
context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions
under which the entire set can be determined efficiently.

can be embedded into distributions over tree metrics with distortion O(log n).
It is also known that this bound is tight since there are expander graphs which
cannot be embedded into distributions over trees with better than Omega(log n)
distortion.
  We show that this same lower bound holds for embeddings into distributions
over any minor excluded family. Given a family of graphs F which excludes minor
M where |M|=k, we explicitly construct a family of graphs with treewidth-(k+1)
which cannot be embedded into a distribution over F with better than Omega(log
n) distortion. Thus, while these minor excluded families of graphs are more
expressive than trees, they do not provide asymptotically better approximations
in general. An important corollary of this is that graphs of treewidth-k cannot
be embedded into distributions over graphs of treewidth-(k-3) with distortion
less than Omega(log n).
  We also extend a result of Alon et al by showing that for any k, planar
graphs cannot be embedded into distributions over treewidth-k graphs with

the opinion-updating process, the agents either interact with their neighbors
under a majority rule with probability $1-q$, or make their own decisions with
free will (model I) or according to the massive opinion (model II) with
probability $q$. We investigate the difference of the average numbers of the
two opinions as a function of $q$ in the steady state. We find that the
location of the order-disorder phase transition point may be shifted according
to the involved dynamics, giving rise to either smooth or harsh conditions to
achieve an ordered state. For the practical case with a finite population size,
we conclude that there always exists a threshold for $q$ below which a full

condensation and interface localization transitions. Choosing a polymer to
colloid size ratio of q=0.8 and studying ultrathin films in the range of D=3 to
D=10 colloid diameters thickness, grand canonical Monte Carlo methods are used;
phase transitions are analyzed via finite size scaling, as in previous work on
bulk systems and under confinement between identical types of walls. Unlike the
latter work, inequivalent walls are used here: while the left wall has a
hard-core repulsion for both polymers and colloids, at the right wall an
additional square-well repulsion of variable strength acting only on the
colloids is present. We study how the phase separation into colloid-rich and
colloid-poor phases occurring already in the bulk is modified by such a
confinement. When the asymmetry of the wall-colloid interaction increases, the
character of the transition smoothly changes from capillary condensation-type
to interface localization-type. The critical behavior of these transitions is
discussed, as well as the colloid and polymer density profiles across the film
in the various phases, and the correlation of interfacial fluctuations in the
direction parallel to the confining walls. The experimental observability of
these phenomena also is briefly discussed.

a distinct minimum by either tuning the coupling strength and/or the driving

$\Lambda$CDM model, our 'vanilla' model, cosmological parameters are tightly
constrained and consistent with current estimates from various methods. When
the dark energy parameter $w$ is free we find that the constraints remain
mostly unchanged, i.e. changes are smaller than the 1 sigma uncertainties.
Similarly, relaxing the assumption of a flat universe leads to nearly identical
constraints on the dark energy density parameter of the universe
$\Omega_\Lambda $, baryon density of the universe $\Omega_b $, the optical
depth $\tau$, the index of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations $n_S$,
with most one sigma uncertainties better than 5%. More significant changes
appear on other parameters: while preferred values are almost unchanged,
uncertainties for the physical dark matter density $\Omega_ch^2$, Hubble
constant $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ are typically twice as large. We found that
different methodological approaches on large scale structure estimates lead to
appreciable differences in preferred values and uncertainty widths. We also
found that possible evolution in SNIa intrinsic luminosity does not alter these
constraints by much, except for $w$, for which the uncertainty is twice as
large. At the same time, this possible evolution is severely constrained. We
conclude that systematic uncertainties for some estimated quantities are
similar or larger than statistical ones.

Especially models for the formation of stars near super massive black holes or
the fast transfer of short-lived massive stars into the innermost parsec of our
galaxy can be tested. By measuring the orbits of stars close to the massive
black hole one can probe deviations from a Keplerian motion. Such deviations
could be due to a swarm of dark, stellar mass objects that perturb the point
mass solution. At the same time the orbits are affected by relativistic
corrections which thus can be tested. The ultimate goal is to test the effects
of general relativity in the strong gravitational field. The latter can be
probed with the near infrared flares of SgrA* which are most likely due to
accretion phenomena onto the black hole. We study the expected performance of

of a ""kinetic undercooling"" type boundary condition in a Laplacian growth
problem of Hele-Shaw type. Here we derive a curvature correction to the moving
boundary approximation that resembles surface tension. The calculation is based
on solvability analysis with unconventional features, namely, there are three
relevant zero modes of the adjoint operator, one of them diverging;
furthermore, the inner/outer matching ahead of the front has to be performed on
a line rather than on an extended region; and the whole calculation can be
performed analytically. The analysis reveals a relation between the fields
ahead and behind a slowly evolving curved front, the curvature and the
generated conductivity. This relation forces us to give up the ideal
conductivity approximation, and we suggest to replace it by a constant
conductivity approximation. This implies that the electric potential in the
streamer interior is no longer constant but solves a Laplace equation; this

brings two spin dependent effects: the bandwidth correction and the bandshift

correction factor causes an exchange splitting between the spin-up and
spin-down spectrum, and its role is similar to the exchange interaction in the
classic Stoner model. The spin dependent bandwidth correction lowers the
kinetic energy of electrons by decreasing the majority spin bandwidth for some
electron occupations with respect to the minority spin bandwidth. In certain
conditions it can lead to ferromagnetic alignment. A gain in the kinetic energy
achieved in this way is the opposite extreme to the effect of a gain in
potential energy due to exchange splitting. The bandshift factor is a dominant
force behind the ferromagnetism. The influence of the bandwidth factor is too
weak to create ferromagnetism and the only result is the correction to the
classic coherent potential approximation in favor of ferromagnetism.

galaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshift
of 1.2. This method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of all
galaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. We use an extensive dataset,
assembled in the context of the VVDS survey, which reaches from the UV to the
IR and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. We also
use a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formation
histories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). We find that
we can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formation
rate with good confidence. We validate the star formation rate determinations
in particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observed
galaxies with an emission line measurement. We use our sample to build the
number density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specific
star formation rate and redshift. We then study whether the stellar mass
function at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function and
star formation rate distribution at an earlier time. We find that the predicted
growth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.
However, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower than
observed, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies is
overpredicted. When comparing with a direct measurement of the major merger
rate from the VVDS survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explain
about a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likely
contributed through minor mergers.

hardness of the ionizing radiation. The rate of incidence for intervening NV
components is dN/dz = 3.38 +/- 0.43, corresponding to dN/dX = 1.10 +/- 0.14.
The column density distribution function is fitted by the slope beta = 1.89 +/-
0.22, consistent with measurements for CIV and OVI. The narrow line widths
(b_NV ~ 6 km/s) imply photoionization rather than collisions as dominating
ionization process. The column densities of CIV and NV are correlated but show
different slopes for intervening and associated absorbers, which indicates
different ionizing spectra. Associated systems are found to be more metal-rich,
denser, and more compact than intervening absorbers. This conclusion is
independent of the adopted ionizing radiation. For the intervening NV systems
we find typical values of [C/H] ~ -0.6 and n_H ~ 10^-3.6 cm^-3, and sizes of a
few kpc, while for associated NV absorbers we obtain [C/H] ~ +0.7, n_H ~
10^-2.8 cm^-3, and sizes of several 10 pc. The abundance of nitrogen relative
to carbon [N/C] and alpha-elements like oxygen and silicon [N/alpha] is
correlated with [N/H], indicating the enrichment by secondary nitrogen. The
larger scatter in [N/alpha] in intervening systems suggests an inhomogeneous
enrichment of the IGM. There is an anti-correlation between [N/alpha] and

synthesized from the modified MF model with the DFA scaling exponent close to

test of the LCDM model, providing constraints on the behaviour of dark matter.
Recent work investigating mass distributions of individual galaxy clusters
(e.g. Abell 1689) using weak and strong gravitational lensing has revealed
potential inconsistencies between the predictions of structure formation models
relating halo mass to concentration and those relationships as measured in
massive clusters. However, such analyses employ simple spherical halo models
while a growing body of work indicates that triaxial 3D halo structure is both
common and important in parameter estimates. The very strong assumptions about
the symmetry of the lensing halo implied with circular or perturbative
elliptical NFW models are not physically motivated and lead to incorrect
parameter estimates with significantly underestimated error bars. We here
introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit fully triaxial models
to weak lensing data that gives parameter and error estimates that fully
incorporate the true uncertainty present in nature. Applying the MCMC triaxial
fitting method to a population of NFW triaxial lenses drawn from the shape
distribution of structure formation simulations, we find that including
triaxiality cannot explain a population of massive, highly concentrated
clusters within the framework of LCDM, but easily explains rare cases of
apparently massive, highly concentrated, very efficient lensing clusters. Our
MCMC triaxial NFW fitting method is easily expandable to include constraints
from additional data types, and its application returns model parameters and
errors that more accurately capture the true (and limited) extent of our
knowledge of the structure of galaxy cluster lenses. (abridged)

For a given load, the optimal potential maximizes the current and thus the
power output of the heat engine. We calculate the optimal potential for
different temperature profiles and show that in the limit of a periodic
piecewise constant temperature profile alternating between two temperatures,
the optimal potential leads to a divergent current. This divergence, being an

investigates the trade-off between the energy consumption and the end-to-end

also verified in 2-dimensional Poisson networks using simulations. The main
contribution of this work is the use of a probabilistic link model to define
the energy efficiency of the system and capture the energy-delay trade-offs.
Hence, it provides a more realistic lower bound on both the energy efficiency
and the energy-delay trade-off since it does not restrict the study to the set

trajectory techniques for the propagation of wave packets, Complex WKB and
BOMCA. Complex WKB is derived using a standard saddle point approximation of
the path integral, but taking into account the hbar dependence of both the
amplitude and the phase of the intial wave function, thus giving rise to the
need for complex classical trajectories. BOMCA is derived using a modification
of the saddle point technique, in which the path integral is approximated by
expanding around a near-classical path, chosen so that up to some predetermined
order there is no need to add any correction terms to the leading order
approximation. Both Complex WKB and BOMCA give the same leading order
approximation; in Complex WKB higher accuracy is achieved by adding correction
terms, while in BOMCA no additional terms are ever added -higher accuracy is
achieved by changing the path along which the original approximation is
computed. The path integral derivation of the methods explains the need to
incorporate contributions from more than one trajectory, as observed in
previous numerical work. On the other hand, it emerges that the methods provide
efficient schemes for computing the higher order terms in the asymptotic
evaluation of path integrals. The understanding we develop of BOMCA suggests
that there should exist near-classical trajectories that give exact quantum
dynamical results when used in the computation of the path integral keeping
just the leading order term. We also apply our path integral techniques to give
a compact derivation of the semiclassical approximation to the coherent state
propagator.

medical expenditures present highly skewed, heavy tailed distributions, for
which (a) simple variable transformations are insufficient to achieve a
tractable low-dimensional parametric form and (b) nonparametric methods are not
efficient in estimating exceedance probabilities for large thresholds.
Motivated by this context, in this paper we propose a general Bayesian approach
for the estimation of tail probabilities of heavy-tailed distributions, based
on a mixture of gamma distributions in which the mixing occurs over the shape
parameter. This family provides a flexible and novel approach for modeling
heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it only
requires to specify a prior distribution for a single parameter. By carrying
out simulation studies, we compare our approach with commonly used methods,
such as the log-normal model and nonparametric alternatives. We found that the
mixture-gamma model significantly improves predictive performance in estimating
tail probabilities, compared to these alternatives. We also applied our method
to the Medical Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), for which we estimate the
probability of exceeding a given hospitalization cost for smoking attributable
diseases. We have implemented the method in the open source GSM package,

boson to invisible (Nambu-Goldstone boson) decays are discussed. It is possible
to improve the signal-to-background ratio by looking at the distribution of
either the total transverse momentum of the leptons and the missing transverse
momentum, or by looking at the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the
missing transverse momentum and the momentum of the lepton pair for the Z- and
Higgs-boson associated production. We also study variations of the model with
non-Abelian symmetries and present approximate formulae for Higgs boson decay
rates. Searching for Higgs bosons in such a scenario at the LHC would most
likely be solely based on Higgs to ""invisible"" decays.

that, for both static and time-dependent surface charge correlation functions,
the inclusion of retardation effects causes the quantum prefactor to take its
universal static classical form, for any temperature.

gauge parameter dependence of different schemes for tan(beta) at one-loop
explicit. In so doing, we update, within these general gauges, an important
Ward-Slavnov-Taylor identity on the mixing between the pseudo-scalar Higgs,
A^0, and the Z^0. We then compare the tan(beta) scheme dependence of a few
observables. We find that the best tan(beta) scheme is the one based on the
decay A^0 -> tau^+ tau^- because of its gauge invariance, being unambiguously
defined from a physical observable, and because it is numerically stable. The
oft used DRbar scheme performs almost as well on the last count, but is usually
defined from non-gauge invariant quantities in the Higgs sector. The use of the
heavier scalar Higgs mass in lieu of tan(beta) though related to a physical
parameter induces too large radiative corrections in many instances and is
therefore not recommended.

new 1 Ms spectra, the relativistic blueshifted line feature is solidly
confirmed in CXO CDFS J033225.3-274219 (CDFS 46, $z$ = 1.617), and marginally
visible in CXO CDFS J033260.0-274748 (CDFS 11, $z$ = 2.579), probably due to
the increased Chandra ACIS background in the new 1 Ms exposure. The new data
rule out the possibility (though very tiny already based on the old 1Ms data)
that the two sources were selected to be unusual due to noise spikes in the
spectra. The only likely interpretation is extremely blueshifted iron
absorption/emission line or absorption edge due to relativistic outflow. We
find that the rest frame emission line center in CDFS 46 marginally decreased
from 16.2 keV to 15.2 keV after 7 years. The line shift can be due to either
decreasing outflowing velocity or lower ionization level. Including the two
quasars reported in this paper, we collect from literature a total of 7 quasars
showing blueshifted emission or absorption line feature with $v\geq0.4c$ in

parameter estimation, which is the valid basis for statistical inference. More

the nature of the coupling between the brane tension and the dilaton this model
can describe the late-time acceleration of the brane expansion (for the normal
branch) as it moves within the bulk. The acceleration is produced together with
a mimicry of the crossing of the cosmological constant line (w=-1) on the
brane, although this crossing of the phantom divide is obtained without
invoking any phantom matter neither on the brane nor in the bulk. The role of
dark energy is played by the brane tension, which reaches a maximum positive
value along the cosmological expansion of the brane. It is precisely at that
maximum that the crossing of the phantom divide takes place. We also show that
these results remain valid when the induced gravity term on the brane is

B-sites, and on Ba_2MnReO_6 as well as Ba_2FeMoO_6. The Curie temperatures are
estimated ab initio from the electronic structures obtained with the local
spin-density functional approximation, full-potential generalized gradient
approximation and/or the LDA+U method (U - Hubbard parameter). Frozen
spin-spirals are used to model the excited states needed to evaluate the
spherical approximation for the Curie temperatures. In cases, where the induced
moments on the oxygen was found to be large, the determination of the Curie
temperature is improved by additional exchange functions between the oxygen
atoms and between oxygen and B' and B"" atoms.
  A pronounced systematics can be found among the experimental and/or
calculated Curie temperatures and the total valence electrons of the transition
metal elements.

manifold. At each point on the manifold, covariance is defined to be a
symmetric and positive definite (2,0)-tensor. Its product with the metric
tensor specifies a linear operator on the respected tangent space.
Collectively, these operators form a covariance operator field. We show that,
in most circumstances, covariance fields are continuous. We also solve the
inverse problem: recovering distribution from a covariance field. Surprisingly,
this is not possible on Euclidean spaces. On non-Euclidean manifolds however,
covariance fields are true distribution representations.

the last unknown two-loop QED corrections to high-energy Bhabha scattering and
have been first announced in \cite{Actis:2007fs}. Here we describe the
corrections in detail and explore their numerical influence. The hadronic
contributions to the virtual O(alpha^2) QED corrections to the
Bhabha-scattering cross-section are evaluated using dispersion relations and
computing the convolution of hadronic data with perturbatively calculated
kernel functions. The technique of dispersion integrals is also employed to
derive the virtual O(alpha^2) corrections generated by muon-, tau- and
top-quark loops in the small electron-mass limit for arbitrary values of the
internal-fermion masses. At a meson factory with 1 GeV center-of-mass energy
the complete effect of hadronic and heavy-fermion corrections amounts to less
than 0.5 per mille and reaches, at 10 GeV, up to about 2 per mille. At the Z
resonance it amounts to 2.3 per mille at 3 degrees; overall, hadronic
corrections are less than 4 per mille. For ILC energies (500 GeV or above), the
combined effect of hadrons and heavy-fermions becomes 6 per mille at 3 degrees;
hadrons contribute less than 20 per mille in the whole angular region.

In particular, we prove an inequality for domains of the unit $n$-dimensional
sphere with a point singularity, and an inequality for functions defined on the
half-space $\R_+^{n+1}$} vanishing on the hyperplane $\{x_{n+1}=0\}$, with
singularity along the $x_{n+1}$-axis. The proofs rely on a one-dimensional
Hardy inequality involving a weight function related to the volume element on
the sphere, as well as on symmetrization arguments. The one-dimensional
inequality is derived in a general form.
