evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) using hydrodynamic + radiative
transfer simulations where reionization is completed either early (z ~ 9) or
late (z ~ 6). In general, we find that low-density gas near large-scale
overdensities is ionized and heated earlier than gas in the large-scale,
underdense voids. Furthermore, at a later time the IGM temperature is inversely
related to the reionization redshift because gas that is heated earlier has
more time to cool through adiabatic expansion and Compton scattering. Thus, at
the end of reionization the median temperature-density relation is an inverted
power-law with slope gamma-1 ~ -0.2, in both models. However, at fixed density,
there is up to order unity scatter in the temperature due to the distribution
of reionization redshifts. Because of the complex equation-of-state, the
evolved IGM temperature-density relations for the redshift range 4 < z < 6 can
still have significant curvature and scatter. These features must be taken into
account when interpreting the Lyman alpha absorption in high redshift quasar
spectra.

differential conductance, penetration depth, and the NMR spin relaxation time.
This extended s-wave symmetry has line-zeroes in between the electron and hole
pockets, but they do not intersect the two Fermi surfaces for moderate doping,
and the superconductor is fully gapped. However, this suggests several
quantitative tests: the exponential decay of the penetration depth weakens and
the density of states reveals a smaller gap upon electron or hole doping.
Moreover, the $\cos(k_x) \cdot \cos(k_y)$ superconducting gap is largest on the
smallest (hole) Fermi surface. For the $1/T_1$ NMR spin relaxation rate, the
inter-band contribution is consistent with the current experimental results,
including a (non-universal) $T^{3}$ behavior and the absence of a coherence
peak. However, the intra-band contribution is considerably larger than the
inter-band contributions and still exhibits a small enhancement in the NMR spin
relaxation rate right below $T_c$ in the clean limit.

which shares much in common with those in granular systems. Anisotropy of the
Josephson couplings along the horizontal and vertical directions plays roles
similar to normal load or density in granular systems. We studied numerically
static and dynamic response of the system against shear, i. e. injection of
external electric current at zero temperature. Current-voltage curves at
various strength of the anisotropy exhibit universal scaling features around
the jamming point much as do the flow curves in granular rheology, shear-stress
vs shear-rate. It turns out that at zero temperature the jamming transition
occurs right at the isotropic coupling and anisotropic JJA behaves as an exotic
fragile vortex matter : it behaves as superconductor (vortex glass) into one
direction while normal conductor (vortex liquid) into the other direction even
at zero temperature. Furthermore we find a variant of the theoretical model for
the anisotropic JJA quantitatively reproduces universal master flow-curves of

rate (SFR) of a galaxy and the luminosity of its brightest star-cluster (SFR
vs. M$_{V}^{brightest}$). We first show that the observed trend between SFR vs.
M$_{V}^{brightest}$ is due to the brightest cluster in a galaxy being
preferentially young (<15 Myr - for a constant SFR) and hence a good tracer of
the current SFR, although we give notable exceptions to this rule. Using a
series of Monte Carlo simulations we show that a pure power-law mass function
with index, alpha=2, is ruled out by the current data. Instead we find that a
Schechter function (i.e. a power-law with an exponential truncation at the high
mass end) provides an excellent fit to the data. Additionally, these
simulations show that bound cluster formation (in Msun/yr) represents only
~8+-3% of the total star-formation within a galaxy, independent of the
star-formation rate. From this we conclude that there is only a single mode of
cluster formation which operates over at least six orders of magnitude in the
SFR. Using this relation, we can extrapolate backwards in time in order to
estimate the peak SFR of major merger galaxies, such as NGC7252, NGC1316 and
NGC3610. The derived SFRs for these galaxies are between a few hundred and a
few thousand solar masses per year. The inferred far infrared luminosity of the
galaxies, from the extrapolated SFR, places them well within the range of
Ultra-luminous galaxies (ULIRGs) and for NGC 7252 within the Hyper-luminous
infrared galaxy regime. Thus, we provide evidence that these post merger
galaxies passed through a ULIRG/HLIRG phase and are now evolving passively.
Using the current and extrapolated past SFR of NGC 34, we infer that the ULIRG
phase of this galaxy has lasted for at least 150 Myr.

similar inferred BH masses, showing near-periodic variability on the time-scale
t_var, would then be proportional to t_var^{8/3}. Luminosity variations
corresponding to a fraction f_Edd<0.01 of the Eddington luminosity would have
been missed in current surveys. However, if the binary inspirals are associated
with quasars, we show that a dedicated survey could detect the population of
SMBHBs with a range of periods around tens of weeks. The discovery of a
population of periodic sources whose abundance obeys N_var = (const)
t_var^{8/3} would confirm (i) that the orbital decay is indeed driven by GWs,
and (ii) that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is being
perturbed by the BHs. Deviations from the t_var^{8/3} power-law could constrain
the structure of the circumbinary gas disk and viscosity-driven orbital decay.
We discuss constraints from existing data, and quantify the sensitivity and sky
coverage that could yield a detection in future surveys.

redshift ~6 quasars observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are thought
to have assembled by mergers and/or gas accretion from less massive ""seed"" BHs.
If the seeds are the ~100 Msol remnant BHs from the first generation of stars,
they must be in place well before redshift z=6, and must avoid being ejected
from their parent proto-galaxies by the large (few hundred km/s) kicks they
suffer from gravitational-radiation induced recoil during mergers with other
BHs. We simulate the SMBH mass function at redshift z=6 using dark matter (DM)
halo merger trees, coupled with a prescription for the halo occupation
fraction, accretion histories, and radial recoil trajectories of the growing
BHs. Our purpose is (i) to map out plausible scenarios for successful assembly
of the z~6 quasar BHs by exploring a wide region of parameter space, and (ii)
to predict the rate of low-frequency gravitational wave events detectable by
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for each such scenario. Our main
findings are as follows: (1) ~100 Msol seed BHs can grow into the SDSS quasar
BHs without super--Eddington accretion, but only if they form in minihalos by
z~30 and subsequently accrete ~60% of the time; (2) the scenarios with
optimistic assumptions required to explain the SDSS quasar BHs overproduce the
mass density in lower--mass (10^5 to 10^7 Msol) SMBHs by a factor of 100-1000,
unless seeds stop forming, or accrete at a severely diminished rates or duty
cycles (e.g. due to feedback), at z < 20-30. We also present several successful
assembly models and their LISA detection rates, including a ""maximal"" model
that gives the highest rate (~30/yr at z~6) without overproducing the total

properties and phenomena, which may lead to important applications such as
superlens, subwavelength cavity and slow light devices. However, the negative
refractive index in metamaterials normally requires a stringent condition of
simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability. A new class of
negative index metamaterials - chiral NIMs, have been recently proposed. In
contrast to the conventional NIMs, chiral NIMs do not require the above
condition, thus presenting a very robust route toward negative refraction. Here
we present the first experimental demonstration of a chiral metamaterial
exhibiting negative refractive index down to n=-5 at terahertz frequencies,
with only a single chiral resonance. The strong chirality present in the
structure lifts the degeneracy for the two circularly polarized waves and
relieves the double negativity requirement. Chiral NIM are predicted to possess
intriguing electromagnetic properties that go beyond the traditional NIMs, such
as opposite signs of refractive indices for the two circular polarizations and
negative reflection. The realization of terahertz chiral NIMs offers new
opportunities for investigations of their novel electromagnetic properties, as

  The tachyon vacuum solution can be described in various ways. We describe its
geometric representation using wedge states, its formal algebraic

also describe the analytical proofs of some of Sen's conjectures for this

present some of the approaches used in the construction of these solutions.
  The generalization of these ideas to open superstring field theory is

the construction of superstring field theory. We then present the cubic and the
non-polynomial versions of superstring field theory and discuss a proposal
suggesting their classical equivalence. Finally, the bosonic solutions are
generalized to this case. In particular, we focus on the (somewhat surprising)

consideration of its reality in the fossil record. Cross-spectral analysis of

equivalent to better than the errors in either measurement. Consequently, the
two data sets not only contain the same strong periodicity, but its peaks and
valleys closely correspond in time. Two other spectral peaks appear in the PBDB
analysis, but appear to be artifacts associated with detrending and with the
increased interval length. Sampling-standardization procedures implemented by
the PBDB collaboration suggest that the signal is not an artifact of sampling
bias. Further work should focus on finding the cause of the 62 My periodicity.

objects: there is a quintuply-imaged system at z=0.888 and several other lensed
objects from z=2.2 to 3.0 (the cluster itself is at z=0.28). It is not
difficult to model the lens, as previous work has already done. However, lens
models are generically non-unique. We generate ensembles of models to explore
the non-uniqueness. When the full range of source redshifts is included, all
models are close to \rho \propto r^{-1} out to 200 kpc. But if the quint is
omitted, both shallower and steeper models (e.g., \rho \propto r^{-2}) are
possible. The reason is that the redshift contrast between the quint and the
other sources gives a good measurement of the enclosed mass at two different
radii, thus providing a good estimate of the mass profile in between. This
result supports universal profiles and explains why single-model approaches can
give conflicting results. The mass map itself is elongated in the NW-SE
direction, like the galaxy distribution. An overdensity in both mass and light

and non-adjacent) interval of spins in an arbitrary pure Finitely Correlated
States (FCS). The bounds we derive become exact in the case where one considers
the entanglement of a single spin with a half-infinite chain to the right of
it. Our result permits a more efficient calculation, numerically and in some
cases even analytically, of the entanglement in arbitrary finitely correlated
quantum spin chains. We continue the study of entanglement in the setting of
ground states of Hamiltonians with a spectral gap. In particular, for $V$ a
finite subset of $Z^d$, we let $H_V$ denote a Hamiltonian on $V$ with finite
range, finite strength interactions and a unique ground state with a
non-vanishing spectral gap. For a density matrix $\rho_A$ that describes the
finite-volume restriction to a region $A$ of the unique ground state, we
provide a detailed version of a proof by M. Hastings, that the entropy of
$\rho_A$ is bounded by a uniform constant $C$. Moreover, we provide a detailed
generalization of the 1-dimensional construction of Hastings' approximation to
the ground state in dimensions 2 and higher. Finally, we turn our attention to
the study of a conjecture central to Quantum Information Theory, the
multiplicativity of the maximal output Schatten $p$-norm of quantum channels,
for $p > 1$. In particular, we study the output 2-norm for a special class of
quantum channels, the depolarized Werner-Holevo channels, and show that
multiplicativity holds for a product of two identical channels in this class.

experiments and numerical simulations of model foams subjected to
boundary-driven oscillatory, planar shear. Our studies are performed on bubble
rafts (experiments) and the bubble model (simulations) in 2D. We focus on the
low-amplitude flow regime in which T1 bubble rearrangement events do not occur,
yet the system transitions from solid- to liquid-like behavior as the driving
frequency is increased. In both simulations and experiments, we observe two
distinct flow regimes. At low frequencies $\omega$, the velocity profile of the
bubbles increases linearly with distance from the stationary wall, and there is
a nonzero total phase shift between the moving boundary and interior bubbles.
In this frequency regime, the total phase shift scales as a power-law $\Delta
\sim \omega^n$ with $n \approx 3$. In contrast, for frequencies above a
crossover frequency $\omega > \omega_{p}$, the total phase shift $\Delta$
scales linearly with the driving frequency. At even higher frequencies above a
characteristic frequency $\omega_{nl} > \omega_{p}$, the velocity profile
changes from linear to nonlinear. We fully characterize this transition from
solid- to liquid-like flow behavior in both the simulations and experiments,
and find qualitative and quantitative agreement for the characteristic
frequencies.

the standard codon table is highly non-random. The three main concepts on
origin and evolution of the code are the stereochemical theory; the coevolution
theory; and the error minimization theory. These theories are not mutually
exclusive and are also compatible with the frozen accident hypothesis.
Mathematical analysis of the structure and possible evolutionary trajectories
of the code shows that it is highly robust to translational error but there is
a huge number of more robust codes, so that the standard code potentially could
evolve from a random code via a short sequence of codon series reassignments.
Thus, much of the evolution that led to the standard code can be interpreted as
a combination of frozen accident with selection for translational error
minimization although contributions from coevolution of the code with metabolic
pathways and/or weak affinities between amino acids and nucleotide triplets
cannot be ruled out. However, such scenarios for the code evolution are based
on formal schemes whose relevance to the actual primordial evolution is
uncertain, so much caution in interpretation is necessary. A real understanding
of the code's origin and evolution is likely to be attainable only in
conjunction with a credible scenario for the evolution of the coding principle
itself and the translation system.

has important implications for the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding as
well as for misfolding and aggregation diseases. However, it has been
universally accepted that residual structure should not affect the global size
scaling of the denatured chain, which obeys the statistics of random coil
polymers. Here we use a single-molecule optical technique, fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy, to probe the denatured state of set of repeat
proteins containing an increasing number of identical domains, from two to
twenty. The availability of this set allows us to obtain the scaling law for
the unfolded state of these proteins, which turns out to be unusually compact,
strongly deviating from random-coil statistics. The origin of this unexpected
behavior is traced to the presence of extensive non-native polyproline II
helical structure, which we localize to specific segments of the polypeptide
chain. We show that the experimentally observed effects of PPII on the size
scaling of the denatured state can be well-described by simple polymer models.
Our findings suggest an hitherto unforeseen potential of non-native structure
to induce significant compaction of denatured proteins, affecting significantly
folding pathways and kinetics.

molecular gas in the nearby Circinus galaxy. The HI mosaic of Circinus exhibits
the warps in position angle and inclination revealed in the single-pointing
image, both of which appear to settle beyond the inner 30 kpc which was
previously imaged. The molecular gas has been mapped in both the CO
transitions, where we derive a total molecular gas mass of ~2e9 Mo. Within a
radius of 3 kpc, i.e. where CO was clearly detected, the molecular fraction
climbs steeply from ~0.7 to unity with proximity to the nucleus. Our HI mosaic
gives an atomic gas mass of ~6e9 Mo which is 70% of the fully mapped single
dish value. The total neutral gas mass to dynamical mass ratio is therefore 3%,
consistent with the SAS3 classification of Circinus. The high (molecular) gas
mass fraction found previously, only occurs close to the central ~0.5 kpc and
falls to < 10% within and outwith this region, allaying previous concerns
regarding the validity of applying the Galactic conversion ratio to Circinus.
The rotation curve, as traced by both the HI and CO, exhibits a steep dip at ~1
kpc, the edge of the atomic/molecular ring, within which the star-burst is
occurring. We find the atomic and molecular gases to trace different
kinematical features and believe that the fastest part of the sub-kpc ring
consists overwhelmingly of molecular gas. Beyond the inner kpc, the velocity
climbs to settle into a solid body rotation at >10 kpc. Most of the starlight
emanates from within this radius and so much of the dynamical mass, which
remains climbing to the limit of our data (>50 kpc), must be due to the dark
matter halo.

of wireless two way relay channel (TWRC) by allowing the two end nodes to
transmit messages to the relay simultaneously. To achieve reliable
communication, channel coding could be applied on top of PNC. This paper
investigates link-by-link channel-coded PNC, in which a critical process at the
relay is to transform the superimposed channel-coded packets received from the
two end nodes plus noise, Y3=X1+X2+W3, to the network-coded combination of the
source packets, S1 XOR S2 . This is in distinct to the traditional
multiple-access problem, in which the goal is to obtain S1 and S2 separately.
The transformation from Y3 to (S1 XOR S2) is referred to as the
Channel-decoding-Network-Coding process (CNC) in that it involves both channel
decoding and network coding operations. A contribution of this paper is the
insight that in designing CNC, we should first (i) channel-decode Y3 to the
superimposed source symbols S1+S2 before (ii) transforming S1+S2 to the
network-coded packets (S1 XOR S2) . Compared with previously proposed
strategies for CNC, this strategy reduces the channel-coding network-coding
mismatch. It is not obvious, however, that an efficient decoder for step (i)
exists. A second contribution of this paper is to provide an explicit
construction of such a decoder based on the use of the Repeat Accumulate (RA)
code. Specifically, we redesign the belief propagation algorithm of the RA code
for traditional point-to-point channel to suit the need of the PNC
multiple-access channel. Simulation results show that our new scheme
outperforms the previously proposed schemes significantly in terms of BER

spontaneous emission, the mean photon number of the cavity field exhibits
threshold behavior indicating that the system may operate as an ordinary laser.
When the spontaneous emission is eliminated on the lasing transition, no
threshold is observed for all values of the pumping rate indicating the system
becomes a thresholdless laser. Moreover, we find that under a thresholdless
operation, the mean photon number can increase nonlinearly with the pumping
rate, and this process is accompanied by a sub-Poisson statistics of the field.
This suggests that the nonclassical statistics can be used to distinguish a
nonlinear operation of the dressed-atom laser.

able to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical
parameter in studies of the reionization era and early galaxy formation. In
this paper we combine observations of Lyman-alpha absorption towards high
redshift quasars with the measured UV luminosity function of high redshift
galaxies to constrain the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing photons from
galaxies at z ~ 5.5-6. The observed Lyman-alpha transmission constrains the
escape fraction to lie in the range f_esc ~ 10-25 % (at z ~ 5.5-6). Excluding
halos with M< 10^10 M_sun (as might be expected if galaxy formation is
suppressed due to the reionization of the IGM) implies a larger escape fraction
of f_esc ~ 20-45 %. Using the numerical results to calibrate an analytic
relation between the escape fraction and minimum galaxy halo mass we also
extrapolate our results to a mass (M~10^8 M_sun) corresponding to the hydrogen
cooling threshold. In this case we find f_esc ~ 5-10 %, consistent with
observed estimates at lower redshift. We find that the escape fraction of high
redshift galaxies must be greater than 5 % irrespepctive of galaxy mass. Based
on these results we use a semi-analytic description to model the reionization
history of the IGM, assuming ionizing sources with escape fractions suggested
by our numerical simulations. We find that the IBG observed at z ~ 5.5-6
implies a sufficient number of ionizing photons to have reionized the Universe
by z ~ 6. However, if the minimum mass for star-formation were greater than
10^9 M_sun, the IBG would be over-produced at redshifts less than z ~ 5. In
summary, our results support a scenario in which the IGM was reionized by low
mass galaxies.

body plan diversity. Striped patterns of gene expression that lead to the
future body segments appear simultaneously or sequentially in long and short
germ-band development, respectively. Regulatory genes relevant for stripe
formation are evolutionarily conserved among arthropods, therefore the
differences in the observed traits are thought to have originated from how the
genes are wired. To reveal the basic differences in the network structure, we
have numerically evolved hundreds of gene regulatory networks that produce
striped patterns of gene expression. By analyzing the topologies of the
generated networks, we show that the characteristics of stripe formation in
long and short germ-band development are determined by Feed-Forward Loops
(FFLs) and negative Feed-Back Loops (FBLs) respectively. Network architectures,
gene expression patterns and knockout responses exhibited by the artificially
evolved networks agree with those reported in the fly Drosophila melanogaster
and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. For other arthropod species, principal
network architectures that remain largely unknown are predicted.

X-ray pulsars with Be-type companions during major X-ray outbursts. Different
spectral states were defined according to the value of the X-ray colours and
flux. Transient Be/X-ray binaries exhibit two branches in their colour-colour
and colour-intensity diagrams: the horizontal branch corresponds to a
low-intensity state and shows the larger fractional rms, similar to the the
island state in atolls and horizontal branch in Z sources; the diagonal branch
corresponds to a high-intensity state, in which the source spends about 75% of
the total duration of the outburst. Despite the complexity of the power spectra
due to the peaks of the pulse period and its harmonics, the aperiodic
variability of Be/X-ray binaries can be described with a relatively low number
of Lorentzian components. Some of these components can be associated with the
same type of noise as that seen in low-mass X-ray binaries, although the
characteristic frequencies are about one order of magnitude lower. The pattern
traced by V 0332+53 results in a Z shaped track, similar to the low-mass Z
sources, without the flaring branch. In contrast, the horizontal branch in 4U
0115+63, KS 1947+300 and EXO 2030+375 corresponds to a low/soft state, not seen
in other types of X-ray binaries. The noise at very low frequencies follows a
power law in V 0332+53 (like in LMXB Z) and it is flat-topped in 4U 0115+63, KS

or blueshifted narrow spectral lines (both emission or absorption) in the X-ray
spectra of active galaxies, but these are all modest detections in terms of
their statistical significance. The aim of this paper is to review the issue of
the significance of these detections and, in particular, take account of
publication bias. A literature search revealed 38 reported detections of
narrow, strongly shifted (v/c >= 0.05) X-ray lines in the 1.5-20 keV spectra of
Seyfert galaxies and quasars. These published data show a close, linear
relationship between the estimated line strength and its uncertainty, in the
sense that better observations (with smaller uncertainties) only ever show the
smallest lines. This result is consistent with many of the reported lines being
false detections resulting from random fluctuations, drawn from a large body of
data and filtered by publication bias such that only the most `significant'
fluctuations are ever reported. The reality of many of these features, and
certainly their prevalence in the population at large, therefore remains an
open question that is best settled though uniform analysis (and reporting) of
higher quality observations.

transfer rate during outbursts of dwarf novae and soft X-ray transients: the
hot outer disc rim itself could heat the L1 point and scattered radiation by
optically thin outflowing matter could also heat L1 significantly. We determine
quantitatively the increase of the mass transfer rate resulting from an extra
heating. During outbursts, the disc edge heats up the upper layer of the
secondary with a flux of the order of the intrinsic stellar flux. This probably
has no large effect on the mass transfer rate. In soft X-ray transients, the
environing medium of the disc (corona+wind) could back-scatter a certain
fraction of the accretion luminosity toward L1. Since soft X-ray transients
reach high luminosities, even a low efficiency of this effect could yield a
significant heating of L1, whereas we show that in dwarf novae this effect is
negligible. Initially the incoming radiation does not penetrate below the
photosphere of the secondary. Depending on the heating efficiency, which has to
be determined, the mass transfer rate could be significantly increased (~x100).

yields a Doppler map that illustrates the wind interactions in the system.
Finally, an atmosphere code is used to determine the different chemical
abundances of the system components and the wind parameters. HD 47129 appears
to be an O8 III/I + O7.5 III binary system in a post RLOF evolutionary stage,
where matter has been transferred from the primary to the secondary star. The
He overabundance of the secondary supports this scenario. In addition, the N
overabundance and C underabundance of the primary component confirm previous
results based on X-ray spectroscopy and indicate that the primary is an evolved
massive star. Furthermore, the secondary star has a large rotational velocity
that deforms its surface, leading to a non-uniform distribution in effective
temperature. This could explain the variations in the equivalent widths of the
secondary lines with phase. We suggest that the wind of the secondary star is
confined near the equatorial plane because of its high rotational velocity,
affecting the ram pressure equilibrium in the wind interaction zone.

prominent only when a critical distribution is approached. We establish that

backaction induced by the capacitive coupling between the DQD and the MR. The
DQD is excited by a microwave field and afterwards a tunneling event results in
the decay of the excited state of the DQD. An important advantage of this
system is that both the energy level splitting and the decay rate of the DQD
can be well tuned by varying the gate voltage. We find that the steady average

rate of the excited state and the detuning between the transition frequency of
the DQD and the microwave frequency, in analogy to the laser sideband cooling
of an atom or trapped ion in atomic physics. Our results show that the cooling

both ion-core and macroscopic structural potentials, this over-simple picture
has lead to intense debate. For example, an externally applied field acting on
the envelope of the electron wavefunction determined by the macroscopic

orders of magnitude while the Ehrenfest theorem suggests that it should
actually be zero. Here we challenge, both experimentally and theoretically, the

to its application in network coding. Reduced row echelon form of the linear
subspaces and Ferrers diagram can play a key role for solving coding problems
in the projective space. In this paper we propose a method to design
error-correcting codes in the projective space. We use a multilevel approach to
design our codes. First, we select a constant weight code. Each codeword
defines a skeleton of a basis for a subspace in reduced row echelon form. This
skeleton contains a Ferrers diagram on which we design a rank-metric code. Each
such rank-metric code is lifted to a constant dimension code. The union of
these codes is our final constant dimension code. In particular the codes
constructed recently by Koetter and Kschischang are a subset of our codes. The
rank-metric codes used for this construction form a new class of rank-metric
codes. We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the
projective space. The efficiency of the decoding depends on the efficiency of
the decoding for the constant weight codes and the rank-metric codes. Finally,
we use puncturing on our final constant dimension codes to obtain large codes
in the projective space which are not constant dimension.

unique amongst AGN. Here we look at the another unique feature of RE J1034+396,
namely its huge soft X-ray excess, to see if this is related in any way to the
detection of the QPO. We show that all potential models considered for the soft
energy excess can fit the 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum, but that the energy
dependence of the rapid variability (which is dominated by the QPO) strongly
supports a spectral decomposition where the soft excess is from low temperature
Comptonization of the disc emission and remains mostly constant, while the
rapid variability is produced by the power law tail changing in normalization.
The presence of the QPO in the tail rather than in the disc is a common feature
in black hole binaries, but low temperature Comptonization of the disc spectrum
is not generally seen in these systems. The main exception to this is GRS
1915+105, the only black hole binary which routinely shows super-Eddington
luminosities. We speculate that super-Eddington accretion rates lead to a
change in disc structure, and that this also triggers the X-ray QPO.

be defined to be the idempotent self-adjoint Q-valued matrices. These can be
thought of as Q-valued equivalence relations, and, accordingly, the morphisms
of sheaves are the Q-valued functional relations. Few concrete examples of such
sheaves are known, however, and in this paper we provide a new one by showing
that the category of equivariant sheaves on a localic etale groupoid G (the
classifying topos of G) is equivalent to the category of sheaves on its
involutive quantale O(G). As a means towards this end we begin by replacing the
category of matrix sheaves on Q by an equivalent category of complete Hilbert
Q-modules, and we approach the envisaged example where Q is an inverse quantal

clarity of the arguments depend on which framework is being used, for which
currently special relativity, general relativity and some schemes of quantum
gravity are available. Canonical gravity provides means to analyze the field
equations as well as observable quantities, the latter even in coordinate
independent form. This allows a unique perspective on the question of
dimensionality since the space-time manifold does not play a prominent role.
After re-introducing a Minkowski background into the formalism, one can see how
distinguished coordinates of special relativity arise, where also the nature of
time is different from that in the general perspective. Just as it is of
advantage to extend special to general relativity, general relativity itself
has to be extended to some theory of quantum gravity. This suggests that a
final answer has to await a thorough formulation and understanding of a
fundamental theory of space-time. Nevertheless, we argue that current insights
into quantum gravity do not change the picture of the role of time obtained

contrary to the recent assertion of the MAGIC group that the Universe is more
transparent to \gray s than our calculations indicate. Our analysis indicates
that in the energy range between ~80 and ~500 GeV, 3C279 has a best-fit
intrinsic spectrum with a spectral index ~1.78 using our fast evolution model
and ~2.19 using our baseline model. However, we also find that spectral indices
in the range of 0.0 to 3.0 are almost as equally acceptable as the best fit
spectral indices. Assuming the same intrinsic spectral index for this flare as
for the 1991 flare from 3C279 observed by EGRET, viz., 2.02, which lies between
