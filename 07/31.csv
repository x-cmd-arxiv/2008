Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature using the AdS/CFT correspondence. As is
widely known, the potential calculated in the pioneering works of Rey et al.
and Brandhuber et al. is zero for separation distances r between the quark and
the anti-quark above a certain critical separation, at which the potential has
a kink. We point out that by analytically continuing the string configurations
into the complex plane, and using a slightly different renormalization
subtraction, one obtains a smooth non-zero (negative definite) potential
without a kink. The obtained potential also has a non-zero imaginary
(absorptive) part for separations r > r_c = 0.870/\pi T . At large separations
r the real part of the potential does not exhibit the exponential Debye falloff
expected from perturbation theory and instead falls off as a power law,
proportional to 1/r^4 for r > r_0 = 2.702 / \pi T.

that, unlike what happens in the case the coupling to the curvature \xi is
generic, for the special cases \xi=0 and \xi = 1/6 the large distance behavior
of the expectation value <T^{\mu}_{\nu}> turns out to be independent of the
internal structure of the gravitational source. Here, we address a higher
dimensional generalization of this result: We first compute the difference
between a black hole and a static spherically symmetric star for the

that the conformally invariant massless scalar field theory in a static

<T^{\mu}_{\nu}> for a weakly gravitating object. These results lead to the
explicit expression of the expectation value <T^{\mu}_{\nu}> for a

we obtain quantum corrections to the gravitational potential in D dimensions,

Einstein condensates (BEC) are a natural example of analogue model since one
can identify matter propagating on a (pseudo-Riemannian) metric with collective
excitations above the condensate of atoms. However, until now, a description of
the ""analogue gravitational dynamics"" for such model was missing. We show here
that in a BEC system with massive quasi-particles, the gravitational dynamics
can be encoded in a modified (semi-classical) Poisson equation. In particular,
gravity is of extreme short range (characterized by the healing length) and the
cosmological constant appears from the non-condensed fraction of atoms in the
quasi-particle vacuum. While some of these features make the analogue
gravitational dynamics of our BEC system quite different from standard
Newtonian gravity, we nonetheless show that it can be used to draw some
interesting lessons about ""emergent gravity"" scenarios.

particles or grains separated from one another by thin amorphous grain boundary
(GB) regions. While GB have been exhaustively investigated at low temperatures,
where these regions resolve into complex ordered structures accessible to
measurement, much less is known about them at higher temperatures where the GB
can exhibit significant mobility, structural disorder, and where experimental
characterization methods are limited. The time and spatial scales accessible to
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation make this method appropriate for
investigating both the dynamical and structural properties of grain boundaries
at elevated temperatures. In the present study, we use MD simulations to
determine how the GB dynamics changes with temperature and applied stress. It
has long been hypothesized that GB have features in common with glass-forming
liquids based on the processing characteristics of polycrystalline materials.
We find remarkable support for this suggestion, as evidenced by string-like
collective motion, transient caging of atom motion, and non-Arrhenius
(Vogel-Fulcher) temperature dependence of GB mobility. Evidently, the
frustration caused by the inability of atoms in GB region to simultaneously
order with respect to competing grains is responsible for this striking
similarity. The paradigm that grains in a polycrystalline material are
encapsulated by a frustrated fluid provides a powerful conceptual model of
polycrystalline materials, pointing the way to improved control over their
material properties.

hotly debated to establish, first of all, their reality against possible
selection effects. These are best studied in the observer planes, namely the
peak energy E_peak_obs vs the fluence F or the peak flux P. In a recent paper
we started to attack this problem considering all GRBs with known z and
spectral properties. Here we consider instead all bursts with known E_peak_obs,
irrespective of z, adding to those a sample of 100 faint BATSE bursts
representative of a larger population. This allows us to construct a complete,
fluence limited, sample, to study the selection/instrumental effects. We found
that fainter bursts have smaller E_peak_obs than those of bright events. As a
consequence, the E_peak_obs of these bursts is correlated with the fluence,
though with a slope flatter than that defined by bursts with z. Selection
effects, which are present, are shown not to be responsible for the existence
of such a correlation. About 6% of these bursts are surely outliers of the
E_peak-E_iso correlation (updated to include 83 bursts), since they are
inconsistent with it for any z. E_peak_obs correlates also with P, with a slope
similar to the E_peak-L_iso correlation.In this case there is only one sure
outlier.The scatter of the E_peak_obs-P correlation defined by the BATSE bursts
of our sample is smaller than the E_peak_obs-F correlation of the same bursts,
while for the bursts with known z the E_peak-E_iso correlation is tighter than
the E_peak-L_iso one. Once a very large number of bursts with E_peak_obs and z
will be available, we thus expect that the E_peak-L_iso correlation will be
similar to that currently found, whereas it is likely that the E_peak-E_iso
correlation will become flatter and with a larger scatter.

galaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. On one hand, the
halo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of
galaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different
cosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. On the
other hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actual
mass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to
constrain cosmological parameters. In this paper we establish the link between
galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity
function (CLF). We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity
function and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.
The resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.
For a cosmology with $(\Omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the model
accurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the SDSS. For a
comparison cosmology with $(\Omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, we
can accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the
galaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too
high, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.
We conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing
is a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to
yield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly
probes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary to
constraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes the
large-scale (linear) matter distribution.

from low scale supersymmetry breaking, this mass hierarchy leads to an unusual
signal where every superpartner cascades down to a chargino that decays into an
on-shell W and a gravitino, possibly with a macroscopic chargino track. We
clearly identify the region of parameters where this signal can occur. We find
it is generic in the context of the R-symmetric supersymmetric standard model,
whereas it essentially only occurs in the MSSM when sign(M1) is not equal to
sign(M2) = sign(\mu) and tan(beta) is small. We briefly comment on the search

temperature the thermodynamic density of states is negative. It creates
difficulties with understanding of the Einstein relation between conductivity
and diffusion coefficient. Using the expression for electrochemical potential
that takes into account the long range part of the Coulomb interaction it is
shown that at negative density of states Einstein relation gives a negative
sign of the diffusion coefficient D, but under this condition there is no
thermodynamic limitation on the sign of D. It happens because the unipolar
relaxation of inhomogeneous electron density is not described by the diffusion
equation. The relaxation goes much faster due to electric forces caused by
electron density and by neutralizing background. Diffusion coefficient is
irrelevant in this case and it is not necessarily positive because process of
diffusion does not contribute to the positive production of entropy. In the
case of bipolar diffusion negative D results in a global absolute instability
that leads to formation of neutral excitons. Graphene is considered as an
example of a system, where the density relaxation is expected to be due to
electric force rather than diffusion. It may also have a negative density of
states.

  Aims: We characterize the dynamics of the quiet inter-network chromosphere by
studying the occurrence of acoustic shocks and their relation with the
concomitant photospheric structure and dynamics.
  Methods: We analyze a comprehensive data set that includes high resolution
chromospheric and photospheric spectra obtained with the IBIS imaging
spectrometer in two quiet-Sun regions. This is complemented by high-resolution
sequences of MDI magnetograms of the same targets. From the chromospheric
spectra we identify the spatio-temporal occurrence of the acoustic shocks. We
compare it with the photospheric dynamics by means of both Fourier and wavelet
analysis, and study the influence of magnetic structures.
  Results: Mid-chromospheric shocks occur as a response to underlying powerful
photospheric motions at periodicities nearing the acoustic cut-off, consistent
with 1-D hydrodynamical modeling. However, their spatial distribution within
the supergranular cells is highly dependent on the local magnetic topology,
both at the network and internetwork scale. Large portions of the internetwork
regions undergo very few shocks, as ""shadowed"" by the horizontal component of
the magnetic field. The latter is betrayed by the presence of chromospheric
fibrils, observed in the core of the CaII line as slanted structures with
distinct dynamical properties. The shadow mechanism appears to operate also on
the very small scales of inter-network magnetic elements, and provides for a
very pervasive influence of the magnetic field even in the quietest region
analyzed.

question of life on other planets. At the present time it is safe to say that
we do not have much of an idea as to whether life is common or exceedingly rare
in the universe, and this will probably not be solved for certain unless
definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life is found in the future. Our
presence on Earth is just as consistent with the hypothesis that life is
extremely rare as it is with the hypothesis that it is common, since if there
was only one planet with intelligent life, we would find ourselves on it.
However, we have more information than this, such as the the surprisingly short
length of time it took for life to arise on Earth. Previous authors have
analysed this information, concluding that it is evidence that the probability
of abiogenesis is moderate ($>$ 13% with 95% probability) and cannot be
extremely small. In this paper I use simple probabilistic model to show that
this conclusion was based more on an unintentional assumption than on the data.
While the early formation of life on Earth provides some evidence in the
direction of life being common, it is far from conclusive, and in particular
does not rule out the possibility that abiogenesis has only occurred once in
the history of the universe.

only linear syzygies up to first $p$-th steps. In the present paper, we compare
the linear syzygies of the inner projections with those of $X$ and obtain a
theorem on `embedded linear syzygies' as one of our main results. This is the
natural projection-analogue of `restricting linear syzygies' in the linear

in order to satisfy $\textbf{N}_{2,p}$ and show that the arithmetic depths of
inner projections are equal to that of the quadratic scheme $X$. These results
admit an interesting `syzygetic' rigidity theorem on property
$\textbf{N}_{2,p}$ which leads the classifications of extremal and next to
extremal cases.
  For these results we develope the elimination mapping cone theorem for
infinitely generated graded modules and improve the partial elimination ideal
theory initiated by M. Green. This new method allows us to treat a wider class
of projective schemes which can not be covered by the Koszul cohomology
techniques, because these are not projectively normal in general.

  Bose-Einstein condensate",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.78.053613",,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We simulate the growth of a dual species Bose-Einstein condensate using a
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an additional gain term giving rise to the
growth. Such growth occurs during simultaneous evaporative cooling of a mixture
of two gases. The ground state of a dual condensate is normally either a
miscible mixture, or an immiscible phase with two spatially separated
components. In a cigar trap the ground state typically consists of one
component in the center, and the other component flanking it. Our simulations
show that when the condensates are formed in a cigar trap and the mixture is
phase separated, then the final state upon the end of the growth is generally
far from the true ground state of the system. Instead it consists of multiple,
interleaved bubbles of the two species. Such a pattern was observed recently in
an experiment by Wieman's group at JILA, and our simulations are in good
qualitative agreement with the experiment. We explain the pattern formation as
due to the onset of modulation instability during growth, and study the
dependence of the final state pattern on various parameters of the system.

edge-on and thus absorbs the rest frame 1420 MHz emission along our sight-line.
However, we find this mix of detections and non-detections to only apply at low

no 21-cm absorption, indicating a low abundance of cold neutral gas in (the

introduces a bias where our sample consists exclusively of quasars with
ultra-violet luminosities in excess of 10e23 W/Hz. This may suggest that we
have selected a class of particularly UV bright type-1 objects. Whatever the
cause, it must also be invoked to explain the non-detections in an equal number
of z < 0.7 sources, where we find, for the first time, the same exclusive
non-detections at > 10e23 W/Hz. These objects also turn out to be quasars and,
from these exclusive high UV luminosity--21-cm non-detections, it is apparent
that orientation effects alone cannot account for the mix of 21-cm detections

leading terms in the asymptotic expression of the joint probability density
function (p.d.f.) of the random shear tensor at a general point in the lens
plane due to point masses in the limit of an infinite number of stars. Up to
this order, the p.d.f. depends on the magnitude of the shear tensor, the
optical depth, and the mean number of stars through a combination of radial
position and the stars' masses. As a consequence, the p.d.f.s of the shear
components are seen to converge, in the limit of an infinite number of stars,
to shifted Cauchy distributions, which shows that the shear components have
heavy tails in that limit. The asymptotic p.d.f. of the shear magnitude in the
limit of an infinite number of stars is also presented. Extending to general
random distributions of the lenses, we employ the Kac-Rice formula and Morse
theory to deduce general formulas for the expected total number of images and
the expected number of saddle images. We further generalize these results by
considering random sources defined on a countable compact covering of the light
source plane. This is done to introduce the notion of {\it global} expected
number of positive parity images due to a general lensing map. Applying the
result to microlensing, we calculate the asymptotic global expected number of
minimum images in the limit of an infinite number of stars, where the stars are
uniformly distributed. This global expectation is bounded, while the global
expected number of images and the global expected number of saddle images
diverge as the order of the number of stars.

types of systems are considered. The first case may be relevant to heavy
fermion superconductors, where magnetic field causes spin imbalance via Zeeman
interaction and the system is studied in a grand canonical ensemble. As the
magnetic field increases, the system is transformed from the uniform superfluid
state to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, and finally to the spin
polarized normal state. The second case may be relevant to cold fermionic
systems, where the numbers of fermions of each species are fixed as in a
canonical ensemble. In this case, the groundstate depends on the pairing
strength. For weak pairing, the order parameter exhibits a periodic domain wall
lattice pattern with a localized spin distribution at low spin imbalance, and a
sinusoidally modulated pattern with extended spin distribution at high spin
imbalance. For strong pairing, the phase separation between superfluid state
and polarized normal state is found to be more preferable, while the increase
of spin imbalance simply changes the ratio between them.

what happens with other group IV semiconductor combinations. However, at low x
they are typical examples of well-behaved substitutional compounds, which is
desirable for harnessing the electronic properties of narrow band
semiconductors. In this paper, we propose the appearance of another kind of
single-site defect ($\beta-Sn$), consisting of a single Sn atom in the center
of a Ge divacancy, that may account for these facts. Accordingly, we examine
the electronic and structural properties of these alloys by performing
extensive numerical ab-initio calculations around local defects. The results
show that the environment of the $\beta$ defect relaxes towards a cubic
octahedral configuration, facilitating the nucleation of metallic white tin and
its segregation, as found in amorphous samples. Using the information stemming
from these local defect calculations, we built a simple statistical model to
investigate at which concentration these $\beta$ defects can be formed in
thermal equilibrium. These results agree remarkably well with experimental
findings, concerning the critical concentration above which the homogeneous
alloys cannot be formed at room temperature. Our model also predicts the
observed fact that at lower temperature the critical concentration increases.

an RNA polymerase(RNAP), and a promoter. Even for a simple repressive
transcription factor that disturbs promoter activity at the initial binding of
RNAP, its repression level is not determined solely by the dissociation
constant of transcription factor but is sensitive to the time scales of
processes in RNAP. We first analyse the promoter activity under strong
repression by a slow binding repressor, in which case transcriptions occur in a
burst, followed by a long quiescent period while a repressor binds to the
operator; the number of transcriptions, the bursting and the quiescent times
are estimated by reaction rates. We then examine interference effect from an
opposing promoter, using the correlation function of transcription initiations
for a single promoter. The interference is shown to de-repress the promoter
because RNAP's from the opposing promoter most likely encounter the repressor
and remove it in case of strong repression. This de-repression mechanism should
be especially prominent for the promoters that facilitate fast formation of
open complex with the repressor whose binding rate is slower than about 1/sec.
Finally, we discuss possibility of this mechanism for high activity of promoter
PR in the hyp-mutant of lambda phage.

low stellar winds. This leads to large CO-core mass at the end of the
evolution, so primordial stars with an initial mass between 25 and 85 Msol are
expected to end as direct black holes, the explosion energy being too weak to
remove the full envelope.
  We show that when rotation enters into play, some mass is lost because the
stars are prone to reach the critical velocity during the main sequence
evolution. Contrarily to what happens in the case of very low- but non
zero-metallicity stars, the enrichment of the envelope by rotational mixing is
very small and the total mass lost remains modest. The compactness of the
primordial stars lead to a very inefficient transport of the angular momentum
inside the star, so the profile of Omega(r) is close to Omega r^2 = const. As
the core contracts, the rotation rate increases, and the star ends its life
with a fast spinning core. Such a configuration has been shown to modify
substantially the dynamics of the explosion. Where one expected a weak
explosion or none at all, rotation might boost the explosion energy and drive a
robust supernova. This will have important consequences in the way primordial
stars enriched the early Universe.

aggregation and fragmentation of solid particles (dust grains, dust aggregates,
boulders) in various astrophysical settings, including protoplanetary disks,
planetary- and sub-stellar atmospheres and dense molecular cloud cores. Here we
describe a new algorithm that combines advantages of various standard methods
into one.
  Aims: The aim is to develop a method that 1) can solve for aggregation and
fragmentation, 2) can easily include the effect and evolution of grain
properties such as compactness, composition, etc., and 3) can be built as a
coagulation/fragmentation module into a hydrodynamics simulations.
  Methods: We develop a Monte-Carlo method in which we follow the 'life' of a
limited number of representative particles. Each of these particles is
associated with a certain fraction of the total dust mass and thereby
represents a large number of true particles which all are assumed to have the
same properties as their representative particle. Under the assumption that the
total number of true particles vastly exceeds the number of representative
particles, the chance of a representative particle colliding with another
representative particle is negligibly small, and we therefore ignore this
possibility. This now makes it possible to employ a statistical approach to the
evolution of the representative particles.
  Results: The method reproduces the known analytic solutions of simplified
coagulation kernels, and compares well to numerical results for Brownian motion
using other methods. For reasonably well-behaved kernels it produces good
results even for moderate number of swarms.

higher energy protons for the 2005 January 20 ground level enhancement (GLE).
This event, known as GLE 69, produced the highest intensity of relativistic
solar particles since the famous event on 1956 February 23. The location of
recent X-ray and gamma-ray emission (N14 W61) was near to Sun-Earth connecting
magnetic field lines, thus providing the opportunity to directly observe the
acceleration source from Earth. We restrict our analysis to protons of energy
greater than 450 MeV to avoid complications arising from transport processes
that can affect the propagation of low energy protons. In light of this revised
approach we have reinvestigated two previous GLEs: those of 2000 July 14 (GLE
59) and 2001 April 15 (GLE 60). Within the limitations of the spectral forms
employed, we find that from the peak (06:55 UT) to the decline (07:30 UT)
phases of GLE 69, neutron monitor observations from 450 MeV to 10 GeV are best
fitted by the Gallegos-Cruz & Perez-Peraza stochastic acceleration model. In
contrast, the Ellison & Ramaty spectra did not fit the neutron monitor
observations as well. This result suggests that for GLE 69, a stochastic
process cannot be discounted as a mechanism for relativistic particle
acceleration, particularly during the initial stages of this solar event. For
GLE 59 we find evidence that more than one acceleration mechanism was present,
consistent with both shock and stochastic acceleration processes dominating at
different times of the event. For GLE 60 we find that Ellison & Ramaty spectra
better represent the neutron monitor observations compared to stochastic
acceleration spectra. The results for GLEs 59 and 60 are in agreement with our
previous work.

deterministic setup in a Newtonian setting. A rigorous transition from
deterministic mean-field dynamics of several large particles and infinitely
many small particles to the stochastic motion of the large particles is
invoked. Then the stochastic motion of the large particles is described by a
system of correlated Brownian motions. The scaling in the transition preserves
a characteristic correlation length. From the limiting stochastic equations we
compute the probability fluxes for the separation between two large particles.
We show that, for short times, two particles sufficiently close together tend
to be attracted to each other. This agrees with the observed depletion
phenomena in colloids. To do this computation, we extend the notion of Van
Kampen's one-dimensional flux rate in an appropriate way to account for higher

surface becomes important, and wind anisotropy develops. Polar winds are
expected to be dominant for fast rotating hot stars.
  These polar winds allow the star to lose large quantities of mass and still
retain a high angular momentum, and they modifie the evolution of the surface

how these winds affect the final stages of massive stars, according to our

can either play the role of a unified dark matter (UDM), accounting for both
dark matter and a cosmological constant, or work alongside cold dark matter
(CDM), as a form of dark energy. A key ingredient is the sound speed, that
depends on the nature of the fluid and that, for any given background model,
adds a degree of freedom to the perturbations: in the barotropic case the
square of the sound speed is simply equal to the affine parameter $\alpha$; if
entropic perturbations are present the effective sound speed has to be
specified as an additional parameter. In addition to the barotropic case, we
consider the two limiting cases of effective sound speed equal to 0 or 1. For
$\alpha=c_s^2=0$ our UDM model is equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM with
adiabatic perturbations. Apart of a trivial subcase, all models considered
satisfy the data constraints, with quite standard values for the usual
cosmological parameters. In general our analysis confirms that cosmological

potential wells that lead to structure formation, and an effective cosmological

the melting point in the phase-field crystal model of a pure material with
hexagonal ordering in two dimensions. We investigate the structures of
symmetric tilt boundaries as a function of misorientation for two different
inclinations and compute in the grand canonical ensemble the disjoining
potential V(w) that governs the fundamental interaction between crystal-melt
interfaces as a function of the premelted layer width w. The results reveal
qualitatively different behaviors for high-angle grain boundaries that are
uniformly wetted, with w diverging logarithmically as the melting point is
approached from below, and low-angle boundaries that are punctuated by liquid
pools surrounding dislocations, separated by solid bridges. This qualitative
difference between high and low angle boundaries is reflected in the
w-dependence of the disjoining potential that is purely repulsive (V'(w)<0 for
all w) above a critical misorientation, but switches from repulsive at small w
to attractive at large w for low angles. In the latter case, V(w) has a minimum
that corresponds to a premelted boundary of finite width at the melting point.
Furthermore, we find that the standard wetting condition (the grain boundary
energy is equal to twice the solid-liquid free energy) gives a much too low
estimate of the critical misorientation when a low-temperature value of the
grain boundary energy is used. In contrast, a reasonable estimate is obtained
if the grain boundary energy is extrapolated to the melting point, taking into
account both the elastic softening of the material at high temperature and
local melting around dislocations.

the signature of the proximity effect in the HI Lyalpha forest. Comparing the
effective optical depth near each QSO with the expected one, we clearly detect
the proximity effect on the combined QSO sample and towards each individual
QSO. The observed proximity effect strength distribution (PESD) is asymmetric
towards a weak effect. We demonstrate that this is not simply an effect of
gravitational clustering around QSOs. Comparing simulated PESDs with
observations, we argue that the averaging method to determine the UVB intensity
J is heavily biased towards high values because of the PESD asymmetry. Using
instead the mode of the PESD provides an unbiased estimate of J. For our sample
its modal value is log(J)=-21.51+/-0.15 (in units of ergcm^-2s^-1Hz^-1sr^-1) at
z=2.73. We estimated the excess HI absorption attributed to gravitational
clustering. On scales of ~3 Mpc, only a minority of QSOs shows overdensities of
up to a factor of a few in tau_eff; these are exactly the objects with the
weakest proximity effects. After removing them, we redetermined the UVB
intensity arriving at log(J)=-21.46+0.14-0.21. This is the most accurate
measurement of J to date. We present a new diagnostic based on the shape of the
PESD which strongly supports our conclusion that there is no systematic
overdensity bias for the proximity effect. This additional diagnostic breaks
the otherwise unavoidable degeneracy of the proximity effect between UVB and
overdensity. We estimated the redshift evolution of J and found tentative
evidence for a mild decrease with increasing redshift. Our results are in
excellent agreement with predictions for the evolving UVB intensity, supporting
the notion of a substantial contribution of star-forming galaxies.

finding the max-weight independent set (MWIS) in a graph. First, we study the
performance of the classical loopy max-product belief propagation. We show that
each fixed point estimate of max-product can be mapped in a natural way to an
extreme point of the LP polytope associated with the MWIS problem. However,
this extreme point may not be the one that maximizes the value of node weights;
the particular extreme point at final convergence depends on the initialization
of max-product. We then show that if max-product is started from the natural
initialization of uninformative messages, it always solves the correct LP -- if
it converges. This result is obtained via a direct analysis of the iterative
algorithm, and cannot be obtained by looking only at fixed points.
  The tightness of the LP relaxation is thus necessary for max-product
optimality, but it is not sufficient. Motivated by this observation, we show
that a simple modification of max-product becomes gradient descent on (a
convexified version of) the dual of the LP, and converges to the dual optimum.
We also develop a message-passing algorithm that recovers the primal MWIS
solution from the output of the descent algorithm. We show that the MWIS
estimate obtained using these two algorithms in conjunction is correct when the
graph is bipartite and the MWIS is unique.
  Finally, we show that any problem of MAP estimation for probability
distributions over finite domains can be reduced to an MWIS problem. We believe
this reduction will yield new insights and algorithms for MAP estimation.

the heaviest, i.e. Jupiter, being born the earliest and this axiom is central
to the new perspective then there is an unique initial condition for which 1:2
MMR crossing occurs exactly 300My after the birth of Jupiter. It is shown that
25 My time gap between the birth of Jupiter and Saturn results in the 300 My
time delay in the occurrence of 1:2 MMR. Because the process by which Late
Heavy Bombardment is triggered involves the movement of Neptune over enormous
distances hence almost 200 My time delay occurs between 1:2MMR crossing and the
actual spike in the Meteoritic Shower on all the terrestrial planets as
evidenced by the petrology record on the Moon. The analytical derivation of the
time delay in the spike is a vindication of this new perspective of the
application of planet-satellite dynamics to the birth and evolution of Solar
Systems.

Re=e, is said to be a g-row stochastic (generalized row stochastic) matrix. Let

geometry. The setup allows us to interpret the results in terms of two double
dots with one common dot. One double dot features weak tunnel coupling and can
be understood with atom-like electronic states, the other one is strongly
coupled forming molecule-like states. In nonlinear measurements we identified
patterns that can be analyzed in terms of the symmetry of tunneling rates.
Those patterns strongly depend on the strength of interdot tunnel coupling and
are completely different for atomic- or molecule-like coupled quantum dots
allowing the non-invasive detection of molecular bonds.
