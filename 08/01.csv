in addition to a so-called Mass Varying Neutrino (MaVaN) sector a cosmological
constant (from a false vacuum) is driving the accelerated expansion of the
universe today. For general power law potentials we calculate the effective
equation of state parameter w_{eff}(z) in terms of the neutrino mass scale. Due
to the interaction of the dark energy field (acceleron) with the neutrino
sector, w_{eff}(z) is predicted to become smaller than -1 for z>0, which could
be tested in future cosmological observations. For the considered scenarios,
the neutrino mass scale additionally determines which fraction of the dark
energy is dynamical, and which originates from the cosmological constant like
vacuum energy of the false vacuum. On the other hand, the field value of the
acceleron field today as well as the masses of the right-handed neutrinos,
which appear in the seesaw-type mechanism for small neutrino masses, are not
fixed. This, in principle, allows to realise hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark
energy with a high-scale seesaw where the right-handed neutrino masses are
close to the GUT scale. We also comment on how MaVaN Hybrid Scenarios with
high-scale seesaw might help to resolve stability problems of dark energy
models with non-relativistic neutrinos.

they can serve as an useful distance indicator. We find that these Ultra Long

relation, so in fact they are more ""standard candle""-like than classical
Cepheids. In the reddening-free Wesenheit index, the slope of the ULP PL

Cepheids. The scatter of our sample about the W_I PL relation is 0.22 mag,
approaching that of classical Cepheids and Type Ia Supernovae. We expect this
scatter to decrease as bigger and more uniform samples of ULP Cepheids are
obtained. We also measure a non-zero period derivative for one ULP Cepheid (SMC
HV829) and use the result to probe evolutionary models and mass loss of massive
stars. ULP Cepheids main advantage over classical Cepheids is that they are
more luminous, and as such show great potential as stellar distance indicators
to galaxies up to 100 Mpc and beyond.

Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with brane-localized Higgs sector and bulk gauge and
matter fields is presented. The bulk equations of motion for the gauge and
fermion fields, supplemented by boundary conditions taking into account the
couplings to the Higgs sector, are solved exactly. For gauge fields the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition is performed in a covariant R_xi gauge. For
fermions the mixing between different generations is included in a completely
general way. The hierarchies observed in the fermion spectrum and the quark
mixing matrix are explained naturally in terms of anarchic five-dimensional
Yukawa matrices and wave-function overlap integrals. Detailed studies of the
flavor-changing couplings of the Higgs boson and of gauge bosons and their KK
excitations are performed, including in particular the couplings of the
standard W and Z bosons. A careful analysis of electroweak precision
observables including the S and T parameters and the Zbb couplings shows that
the simplest RS model containing only Standard Model particles and their KK
excitations is consistent with all experimental bounds for a KK scale as low as
a few TeV, if one allows for a heavy Higgs boson and/or for an ultra-violet
cutoff below the Planck scale. The study of flavor-changing effects includes
analyses of the non-unitarity of the quark mixing matrix, anomalous
right-handed couplings of the W bosons, tree-level flavor-changing neutral
current couplings of the Z and Higgs bosons, the rare decays t-->c(u)+Z and
t-->c(u)+h, and the flavor mixing among KK fermions. The results obtained in
this work form the basis for general calculations of flavor-changing processes
in the RS model and its extensions.

  The second part describes the type II superstring using Berkovits' pure
spinor formalism. The derivation of the supergravity constraints from classical
BRST invariance of Berkovits and Howe is carefully reviewed and new aspects are
added. The present derivation uses a covariant variation principle and stays
throughout in the Lagrangian formalism. A new result is the explicit form of
the BRST transformation of the worldsheet fields for type II. By further
deriving the form of the local supersymmetry transformations of the fermionic
fields, a connection is established to the starting point of those supergravity
calculations, which derive generalized Calabi Yau conditions from effective
four-dimensional supersymmetry.
  Generalized complex geometry is in turn the motivation for the last part,
which is based on the author's paper on derived brackets from sigma models and
the relation to integrability of generalized complex structures. Finally there
are detailed appendices on geometric brackets, generalized complex geometry,
Noether's theorem, Bianchi identities, supergauge transformations and the WZ

sieving problem. Take the interval [N] = {1,...,N} and, for each odd prime p <=
N^{1/2}, remove or ``sieve out'' by all n whose reduction mod p lies in some
interval I_p of Z/pZ of length (p-1)/2. Let A be the set that remains: then |A|
<< N^{1/3 + o(1)}, a bound which improves slightly on the bound of |A| <<
N^{1/2} which results from applying the large sieve in its usual form. This is
a very, very weak result in the direction of a question of Helfgott and
Venkatesh, who suggested that nothing like equality can occur in applications
of the large sieve unless the unsieved set is essentially the set of values of
a polynomial (e.g. A is the set of squares).
  Assuming the ``exponent pairs conjecture'' (which is deep, as it implies a
host of classical questions including the Lindel\""of hypothesis, Gauss circle
problem and Dirichlet divisor problem) the bound can be improved to |A| <<
N^{o(1)}. This raises the worry that even reasonably simple sieve problems are
connected to issues of which we have little understanding at the present time.

non-ionizing UV photons. Moreover, NIR spectroscopy also offers the possibility
of studying the characteristics of the putative driving source(s) of the H2
emission by the detection of photospheric and circumstellar spectral features,
and of the environmental conditions (e.g. extinction). We obtained long-slit,
intermediate-resolution, NIR spectra of IRAS19410+2336 using LIRIS. As a
complement, we also obtained J, H and K_s images with the Las Campanas 2.5m Du

very different properties and evolutionary stages in IRAS19410+2336. The most
massive source at millimeter wavelengths, mm1, with a mass of a few tens of
solar masses, has a bright NIR (and MIR) counterpart. This suggests that
emission is leaking at these wavelengths. The second most massive millimeter

correct spectral function entering the Fock-Krylov method to calculate the

latter is essentially the energy derivative of a phase shift. As a bonus, we
can connect the survival probability to scattering data via the phase shift.

for an evolution of the orientation of the jet axis was found. We also place an
upper limit on the proper motion of the system which is consistent with
previous optical studies. Besides the previously reported radio flares close to
the orbital phase 0.0 (interpreted as enhanced accretion at periastron
passage), we also identified outbursts with similar properties near the orbital
phase 0.5. The global spectral index revealed a preferentially steep spectrum
over the entire period of monitoring with a mean value and standard deviation
alpha=-0.9 +/- 0.6 (F_nu ~ nu^{alpha}), which became significantly flatter

smaller than the positive energy assigned to its mass energy. We study the
total energy content of a spherically symmetrical mass body having constant

We show that under certain circumstances, the total energy content of a mass

exhibiting several characteristics of FU Orionis (FUor) eruptive variable
stars. Our data indicates that AR 6, like FU Orionis itself, does not possess a
CO outflow and likewise, does not show evidence for large amounts of molecular
g as in its circumstellar environment. We conclude that from the near-IR to the
sub-mm, AR 6 is similar to FU Orionis in several respects. We interpret the
lack of significant dust and molecular gas in the circumstellar environment of
AR 6, together with the large near-IR thermal excess, as evidence that the
sources have exhausted their natal envelopes, that they have at least small hot
circumstellar disks, and that they are more evolved than Class I protostars.
This, in itself, suggests that, since FUor eruptions have also been observed in
stars with large dust mass envelopes (e.g. V346 Nor) and with CO outflows (e.g.
L1551 IRS5), FUor events probably occur at many different stages in the early,
formative phase of a star's life, and lends support to the idea that FUor
outbursts are repetitive like their shorter-lived relatives occurring in EXor
eruptive variables. Finally, we show that, being part of the 'Spokes' young
stellar cluster, AR 6 is unlike many FUors which typically are located in more
sparsely populated regions.

of hypersurfaces. Roughly speaking, an isolated hypersurface singularity is
called topologically Newton-non-degenerate (tNnd) if the local embedded
topological singularity type can be restored from a collection of Newton
diagrams (for some coordinate choices).
  A singularity that is not tNnd is called essentially Newton-degenerate. For
plane curves we give an explicit characterization of tNnd singularities; for
hypersurfaces we provide several examples.
  Next, we treat the question: whether Nnd or tNnd is a property of singularity
types or of particular representatives. Namely, is the non-degeneracy preserved
in an equi-singular family? This fact is proved for curves. For hypersurfaces
we give an example of a Nnd hypersurface whose equi-singular deformation
consists of essentially Newton-degenerate hypersurfaces.
  Finally, we define the directionally Newton-non-degenerate germs, a subclass
of tNnd germs. For such singularities the classical formulas for the Milnor
number and the zeta function of the Nnd hypersurface are generalized.

in the oscillation periods, dP/dt, allows us to estimate directly rates of
stellar evolutionary changes, such as the cooling rate and the envelope
contraction rate, providing a way to test and refine evolutionary models for
pre-white dwarf pulsating stars.

conversely, studying the universe as a whole also teaches us about particle
physics. This thesis encompasses both of these research directions.
  Many models predict a diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos from active
galactic nuclei and other astrophysical sources. The ""Astrophysics Underground""
portion of this thesis describes a search for this neutrino flux performed by
looking for very high energy upward-going muons using the Super-K detector.
  In addition to using particles to do astronomy, we can also use the universe
itself as a particle physics lab. The ""Particle Physics in the Sky"" portion of
this thesis focuses on extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys.
  To overcome technical challenges faced by the latest galaxy surveys, we
produced a comprehensive upgrade to mangle, a software package that processes
the angular masks defining the survey area on the sky. We added dramatically
faster algorithms and new useful features that are necessary for managing
complex masks of current and next-generation galaxy surveys.
  With this software in hand, we utilized SDSS data to investigate the relation
between galaxies and dark matter by studying relative bias, i.e., the relation
between different types of galaxies. Separating galaxies by their luminosities
and colors reveals a complicated picture: red galaxies are clustered more
strongly than blue galaxies, with both the brightest and the faintest red
galaxies showing the strongest clustering. Furthermore, red and blue galaxies
tend to occupy different regions of space. In order to make precise
measurements from the next generation of galaxy surveys, it will be essential
to account for this complexity.

offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological

anisotropies in the measured galaxy power spectrum, which is independent of
galaxy bias and matches the matter power spectrum shape on large scales. The
amplitude provides a constraint on the derivative of the linear growth rate
through f.sigma_8. This demonstrates that spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer
many of the same advantages as weak lensing surveys, in that they both use
galaxies as test particles to probe all matter in the Universe. They are
complementary as redshift-space distortions probe non-relativistic velocities
and therefore the temporal metric perturbations, while weak lensing tests the
sum of the temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The degree to which our
estimator can be pushed into the non-linear regime is considered and we show
that a simple Gaussian damping model, similar to that previously used to model
the behaviour of the power spectrum on very small scales, can also model the
quasi-linear behaviour of our estimator. This enhances the information that can
be extracted from surveys for LCDM models.

individual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitational
microlensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within the
Milky Way and beyond. Only the complementarity of different techniques
currently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formation
that has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worlds
like ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the Universe. A
cooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring of
microlensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and a
network of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain a
first census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of Earth
orbiting K and M dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely the
Galactic bulge and disk. The hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principal
science driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networks
adopting fully-automated strategies. Several initiatives, both into facilities
as well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see the
capabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing over
the next 10 years. New opportunities will show up with high-precision
astrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets around
stars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. Finally, we should not miss
out on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization to
profit not only the scientists but all the wider society.

decreases, on average, with redshift, and our measurements also show moderate
disagreement with previous models of the UV excess. Our results show little
evolution in the shape of the UV continuum with redshift, consistent either
with the binary model for the formation of Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB)
stars or with no evolution in EHB morphology with look-back time. However, the
binary formation model predicts that the strength of the UV excess should also
be relatively constant, in contradiction with our measured results. Finally, we
see no significant influence of a galaxy's environment on the strength of its

much more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we
change our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are
there rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are

clear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely
mean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can
we measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the

thermodynamic equilibrium. Apart from strong parton interactions the expansion
and development of collective flow is driven by strong gradients in the parton
mean-fields. An analysis of the elliptic flow $v_2$ demonstrates a linear
correlation with the spatial eccentricity $\epsilon$ as in case of ideal
hydrodynamics. The hadronization occurs by quark-antiquark fusion or 3 quark/3
antiquark recombination which is described by covariant transition rates. Since
the dynamical quarks become very massive, the formed resonant 'pre-hadronic'
color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, and
sequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing the
total entropy. This solves the entropy problem in hadronization in a natural
way. The resulting particle ratios turn out to be in line with those from a
grandcanonical partition function at temperature $T \approx 170$ MeV rather
independent from the initial temperature and indicate an approximate

Then we show that for a low density $a$ such a near parallel vector can be
computed using diophantine approximation, via a methodology introduced by Frank

union covers the integer right hand sides, for which the infeasibility is

(MIMO) systems in practice assume a Kronecker model where the variances of the
channel entries, upon decomposition on to the transmit and the receive
eigen-bases, admit a separable form. Measurement campaigns, however, show that
the Kronecker model results in poor estimates for capacity. Motivated by these
observations, a channel model that does not impose a separable structure has
been recently proposed and shown to fit the capacity of measured channels
better. In this work, we show that this recently proposed modeling framework
can be viewed as a natural consequence of channel decomposition on to its
canonical coordinates, the transmit and/or the receive eigen-bases. Using tools
from random matrix theory, we then establish the theoretical basis behind the
Kronecker mismatch at the low- and the high-SNR extremes: 1) Sparsity of the
dominant statistical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the true channel at the
low-SNR extreme, and 2) Non-regularity of the sparsity structure (disparities
in the distribution of the DoF across the rows and the columns) at the high-SNR
extreme.

long hops or routes that consist of short hops in a network of multiple-antenna
nodes, where each transmitting node employs spatial multiplexing. This
distance-dependent route selection problem is approached from the viewpoint of
energy efficiency, where a route is selected with the objective of minimizing
the transmission energy consumed while satisfying a target outage criterion at
the final destination. Deterministic line networks and two-dimensional random
networks are considered. It is shown that when 1) the number of hops traversed
between the source and destination grows large or 2) when the target success
probability approaches one or 3) when the number of transmit and/or receive
antennas grows large, short-hop routing requires less energy than long-hop
routing. It is also shown that if both routing strategies are subject to the
same delay constraint, long-hop routing requires less energy than short-hop
routing as the target success probability approaches one. In addition,
numerical analysis indicates that given loose outage constraints, only a small
number of transmit antennas are needed for short-hop routing to have its
maximum advantage over long-hop routing, while given stringent outage
constraints, the advantage of short-hop over long-hop routing always increases
with additional transmit antennas.

wide, elongated emission gap with fairly sharp and straight edges between the
two radio lobes. This particular subset of the 'superdisk' radio galaxies is
chosen because of a highly asymmetric location of the host elliptical galaxy
relative to the gap's central axis. In addition to posing a considerable
challenge to the existing models, such a morphology also means that the two
jets traverse highly unequal distances through the superdisk material. One thus
has a possibility to directly investigate if the marked asymmetry between the
two jets' interaction with the (much denser) ambient medium, during their
propagation, has a significant import for the brightness of the hotspot forming
near each jet's extremity. We also propose a new explanation for the formation
of superdisks through the merger of a smaller elliptical galaxy with the
massive host, in which the gas attached to the infalling galaxy deposits its
angular momentum into the host's circumgalactic gas, thereby causing it to
flatten into a fat pancake, or superdisk. The asymmetric location of the host
galaxy can be assisted by the kick imparted to it during the merger. We also
suggest a physical link between these radio galaxies and those with X-shaped
and Z-symmetric radio lobes, commonly believed to arise from mergers of two
galactic nuclei, each harboring a supermassive black hole.

and modeled by George Gamow and Francis Crick in the 50-es. Their models
failed. However the valid Genetic Code, provided by Nirenberg and Matthaei in
1961, ignores many theoretical requirements for a perfect Code. Something is
simply missing from the canonical Code.
  Results The 3x redundancy of the Genetic code is usually explained as a
necessity to increase the resistance of the mutation resistance of the genetic
information. However it has many additional roles. 1.) It has a periodical
structure which corresponds to the physico-chemical and structural properties
of amino acids. 2.) It provides physico-chemical definition of codon
boundaries. 3.) It defines a code for amino acid co-locations (interactions) in
the coded proteins. 4.) It regulates, through wobble bases the free folding
energy (and structure) of mRNAs. I shortly review the history of the Genetic
Code as well as my own published observations to provide a novel, original
explanation of its redundancy.
  Conclusions The redundant Genetic Code contains biological information which
is additional to the 64/20 definition of amino acids. This additional
information is used to define the 3D structure of coding nucleic acids as well
as the coded proteins and it is called the Proteomic Code and mRNA Assisted
Protein Folding.

that at any temperature, the Casimir force acting on the piston is always an
attractive force pulling the piston towards the interior region, and the
magnitude of the force gets larger as the separation $a$ gets smaller. Explicit
exact expressions for the Casimir force for small and large plate separations

in contrast to the conventional result that the leading term of the Casimir
force acting on a wall of a rectangular cavity at high temperature is the
Stefan--Boltzmann (or black body radiation) term which is of order $T^{d+1}$,
it is found that the contributions of this term from the interior and exterior

degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular,
networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks
observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a
new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the
Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its
application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks.

universality class of the directed bond percolation process, also known as
simple epidemic process, and is equivalent to the Reggeon field theory. The
turbulent advecting velocity field is modelled by the Obukhov--Kraichnan's
rapid-change ensemble: Gaussian statistics with the correlation function < vv>
\propto \delta(t-t') k^{-d-\xi}, where k is the wave number and 0<\xi<2 is a
free parameter. Using the field theoretic renormalization group we show that,
depending on the relation between the exponent \xi and the space dimensionality
d, the system reveals different types of large-scale asymptotic behaviour,
associated with four possible fixed points of the renormalization group
equations. In addition to known regimes (ordinary diffusion, ordinary directed
percolation process, and passively advected scalar field), existence of a new
nonequilibrium universality class is established, and the corresponding
critical dimensions are calculated to first order of the double expansion in
\xi and \varepsilon=4-d (one-loop approximation). It turns out, however, that
the most realistic values \xi=4/3 (Kolmogorov's fully developed turbulence) and
d=2 or 3 correspond to the case of passive scalar field, when the nonlinearity

The implied evolution in size at fixed mass between z=1 and the present is a
factor of 1.97(0.15). This is in qualitative agreement with semianalytic
models; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predicted
evolution. Our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent with
previous, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5
since z~2. A combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies through
the accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxies
through increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of the
observations.

of almost minimal degree, that is of non-degenerate irreducible projective
varieties whose degree exceeds the codimension by precisely 2, a natural
approach is to investigate simple projections of varieties of minimal degree.
Let $\tilde X \subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ be a variety of minimal degree and
of codimension at least 2, and consider $X_p = \pi_p (\tilde X) \subset
{\mathbb P}^r_K$ where $p \in {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K \backslash \tilde X$. By
\cite{B-Sche}, it turns out that the cohomological and local properties of
$X_p$ are governed by the secant locus $\Sigma_p (\tilde X)$ of $\tilde X$ with
respect to $p$.
  Along these lines, the present paper is devoted to give a geometric
description of the secant stratification of $\tilde X$, that is of the
decomposition of ${\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ via the types of secant loci. We show
that there are exactly six possibilities for the secant locus $\Sigma_p (\tilde
X)$, and we precisely describe each stratum of the secant stratification of
$\tilde X$, each of which turns out to be a quasi-projective variety.
  As an application, we obtain the classification of all non-normal Del Pezzo
varieties by providing a complete list of pairs $(\tilde X, p)$ where $\tilde X
\subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ is a variety of minimal degree, $p$ is a closed
point in $\mathbb P^{r+1}_K \setminus \tilde X$ and $X_p \subset {\mathbb P}^r

coherent understanding of the physical processes that regulate the birth of
stars has not yet been achieved, nor a unanimous consent was reached, despite
the many attempts, on the effects of the environment on the star formation in
galaxies member of rich clusters. We focus on the local and global Schmidt law
and we investigate how cluster galaxies have their star formation activity
perturbed. We collect multifrequency imaging for a sample of spiral galaxies,
member of the Virgo cluster and of the local field; we compute the surface
density profiles for the young and for the bulk of the stellar components, for
the molecular and for the atomic gas. Our analysis shows that the bulk of the
star formation correlates with the molecular gas, but the atomic gas is
important or even crucial in supporting the star formation activity in the
outer part of the disks. Moreover, we show that cluster members which suffer
from a moderate HI removal have their molecular component and their SFR
quenched, while highly perturbed galaxies show an additional truncation in
their star forming disks. Our results are consistent with a model in which the
atomic hydrogen is the fundamental fuel for the star formation, either directly
or indirectly through the molecular phase; therefore galaxies whose HI
reservoirs have been depleted suffer from starvation or even from truncation of
their star formation activity.

reconstruction of the atomic positions of a solid from its diffraction image.
  From a mathematical perspective, this is a notoriously difficult problem,
even in the idealised situation of perfect diffraction from an infinite
structure.
  Here, the problem is analysed via the autocorrelation measure of the
underlying point set, where two point sets are called homometric when they
share the same autocorrelation. For the class of mathematical quasicrystals
within a given cut and project scheme, the homometry problem becomes equivalent
to Matheron's covariogram problem, in the sense of determining the window from
its covariogram. Although certain uniqueness results are known for convex
windows, interesting examples of distinct homometric model sets already emerge
in the plane.
  The uncertainty level increases in the presence of diffuse scattering.
Already in one dimension, a mixed spectrum can be compatible with structures of
different entropy. We expand on this example by constructing a family of mixed
systems with fixed diffraction image but varying entropy. We also outline how
this generalises to higher dimension.

of winding number (1799) in the real-algebraic setting, from which we derive a
real-algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The proof is
elementary inasmuch as it uses only the intermediate value theorem and
arithmetic of real polynomials. It can thus be formulated in the first-order

based on some geometric constructions involving foliations and tools from
intersection theory. This topological result generalizes in finite dimensions
the classical analytic theorem of Hadamard-Plastock, including its recent
improvement by Nollet-Xavier. The main theorem also relates to a conjecture of
the aforementioned authors, involving the well known Jacobian Conjecture in
algebraic geometry.

  galaxies","11 pages, 10 figures, A&A accepted",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200809879",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (Abridged) The aim of this paper is to study the basic equations of the
chemical evolution of galaxies with gas flows. We focus on models in which the
outflow is differential, namely in which the heavy elements (or some of the
heavy elements) can leave the parent galaxy more easily than other chemical
species such as H and He. We study the chemical evolution of galaxies in the
framework of simple models. This allows us to solve analytically the equations
for the evolution of gas masses and metallicities. We find new analytical
solutions for various cases in which the effects of winds and infall are taken
into account. Differential galactic winds have the effect of reducing the
global metallicity of a galaxy, with the amount of reduction increasing with
the ejection efficiency of the metals. Abundance ratios are predicted to remain
constant throughout the whole evolution of the galaxy, even in the presence of
differential winds. One way to change them is by assuming differential winds
with different ejection efficiencies for different elements. However, simple
models apply only to elements produced on short timescales, namely all by Type
II SNe, and therefore large differences in the ejection efficiencies of
different metals are unlikely. Variations in abundance ratios such as [O/Fe] in
galaxies, without including the Fe production by Type Ia supernovae, can in
principle be obtained by assuming an unlikely different efficiency in the loss
of O relative to Fe from Type II supernovae. Therefore, we conclude that it is
not realistic to ignore Type Ia supernovae and that the delayed production of
some chemical elements relative to others (time-delay model) remains the most
plausible explanation for the evolution of alpha-elements relative to Fe.

from SDSS spectra with a simple stellar population synthesis method, we find
that for NLS1s with mass lower than $10^7 \msun$, they fall only marginally

sample is reduced using adaptive binning techniques based on Voronoi
tessellations. We have derived Ha data cubes from which are computed Ha maps,
radial velocity fields as well as residual velocity fields, position-velocity
diagrams, rotation curves and kinematical parameters for almost all galaxies.
The rotation curves, the kinematical parameters and their uncertainties are
computed homogeneously using the new method based on the power spectrum of the
residual velocity field. This paper provides the kinematical parameters for the
whole sample. For the first time, the integrated Ha profiles have been computed
and are presented for the whole sample. The total Ha fluxes deduced from these
profiles have been used in order to provide a flux calibration for the 203

sample concerning (i) the increased accuracy of position angles measurements
using kinematical data, (ii) the difficulty to have robust determinations of
both morphological and kinematical inclinations in particular for low

large peak luminosity have been discovered. Their luminosity requires more than
1 Msun of 56Ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might have
originated from super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. However, the nature of
these objects is not yet well understood. In particular, no data have been
taken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. We report on Subaru
and Keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the SN Ia
2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these ""overluminous"" SNe Ia.
The late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal SNe Ia,
reinforcing the argument that SN 2006gz belongs to a different subclass than
normal SNe Ia. However, the peculiar features found at late times are not
readily connected to a large amount of 56Ni; the SN is faint, and it lacks [Fe
II] and [Fe III] emission. If the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the SN
ejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal SNe Ia, the mass of 56Ni does
not exceed ~ 0.3 Msun. We discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem.
With the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identify
which process is responsible. An interesting possibility is that the bulk of
the emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in other
SNe Ia, which might be related to dense C-rich regions as indicated by the
early-phase data. Alternatively, it might be the case that SN 2006gz, though
peculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times.
