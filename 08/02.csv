purpose of constraining the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL. We work within the
Fisher matrix formalism expanded around fiducial model with f_NL=0 and make
several simplifying assumptions. By slicing a general sample into infinitely
many samples with different biases, we derive the analytic expression for the
relevant Fisher matrix element. We next consider weighting schemes that
construct two effective samples from a single sample of tracers with a
continuously varying bias. We show that a particularly simple ansatz for
weighting functions can recover all information about f_NL in the initial
sample that is recoverable using a given bias observable and that simple
division into two equal samples is considerably suboptimal when sampling of
modes is good, but only marginally suboptimal in the limit where Poisson errors
dominate.

investigate the behavior and robustness of the pyramid infrared wavefront

under the influence of different error sources both intrinsic to the sensor,
and arising in the preceding optical system. The intrinsic errors include
diffraction effects on the pyramid edges and detector read out noise. The
external imperfections consist of a Gaussian profile in the intensity
distribution in the pupil plane during calibration, the effect of an optically
resolved reference source, and noncommon-path aberrations. We investigated the
effect of three differently sized reference sources on the calibration of the
PWFS. For the noncommon-path aberrations the quality of the response of the
system is quantified in terms of modal cross talk and aliasing. We investigate
the special behavior of the system regarding tip-tilt control. From our
measurements we derive the method to optimize the calibration procedure and the
setup of a PWFS adaptive optics (AO) system. We also calculate the total
wavefront error arising from aliasing, modal cross talk, measurement error, and
fitting error in order to optimize the number of calibrated modes for on-sky

and (iii) assuming that the weak magnetic field region width, where electron
meandering motion supports electron pressure tensor off-diagonal
(non-gyrotropic) components, is of the order of electron Larmor radius) a
simple model of magnetic reconnection in a collisionless regime is formulated.
The model is general, resembling its collisional Sweet-Parker analogue in that
it is not specific to any initial configuration e.g. Harris type tearing
unstable current sheet, X-point collapse or otherwise. In addition to its
importance from the fundamental point of view, the collisionless reconnection
model offers a much faster reconnection rate (M_c'less=(c/omega_pe)^2 /(r_L,e
L)) than Sweet-Parker's classical one (M_sp=S^-1/2). The width of the diffusion
region (current sheet) in the collisionless regime is found to be
delta_c'less=(c/omega_pe)^2/r_L,e, which is independent of global reconnection
scale L and is only prescribed by micro-physics (electron inertial length,
c/omega_pe, and electron Larmor radius, r_L,e). Amongst other issues, the
fastness of the reconnection rate alleviates e.g. the problem of interpretation
of solar flares by means of reconnection, as for the typical solar coronal
parameters the obtained collisionless reconnection time can be a few minutes,
as opposed to Sweet-Parker's equivalent value of < a day. The new theoretical
reconnection rate is compared to the MRX device experimental data by [Yamada et
al., Phys. Plasmas, 13, 052119 (2006), Ji et al. GRL, 35, 13106 (2008)] and a

propagation through this system using a combination of analytical and numerical
techniques. Simulations are carried out in a gravitationally stratified
atmosphere with a uniform, vertical magnetic field for both isothermal and
non-isothermal cases. For the non-isothermal case a temperature profile is
chosen to mimic the steep temperature gradient encountered at the transition
region. In all simulations, a slow wave is driven on the upper boundary, thus
propagating down from low-beta to high-beta plasma across the mode-conversion
region. In addition, a detailed analytical study is carried out where we
predict the amplitude and phase of the transmitted and converted components of
the incident wave as it passes through the mode-conversion region. A comparison
of these analytical predictions with the numerical results shows good
agreement, giving us confidence in both techniques. This knowledge may be used
to help determine wave types observed and give insight into which modes may be

geometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to
recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that every
$n$-vertex graph of genus $g$ and maximum degree $d$ satisfies $\lambda_2(G) =
O((g+1)^3 d/n)$. This recovers the $O(d/n)$ bound of Spielman and Teng for
planar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of $O((g+1) poly(d)/n)$, but our
proof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus
able to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by
proving that $\lambda_2(G) = O(d h^6 \log h/n)$ whenever $G$ is $K_h$-minor
free. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to
recover $O(\sqrt{n})$-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a
fixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on
$\lambda_2$ for graphs which exclude small-depth minors in the sense of
Plotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find
small separators in a general class of geometric graphs.
  Moreover, while the standard ""sweep"" algorithm applied to the second
eigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree,
our approach produces a vector that works for arbitrary graphs. This yields an
alternate proof of the result of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that every
excluded-minor family of graphs has $O(\sqrt{n})$-node balanced separators.

  Methods: We compiled ground-based photometric optical/NIR and millimeter data
from several observatories, including the multi-channel imager GROND, as well
as ultraviolet \swift UVOT and X-ray XRT observations. The spectral energy
distribution of the optical/NIR afterglow shows a sharp drop in the \swift UVOT
UV filters that can be utilized for the estimation of a redshift.
  Results: Fitting the SED from the \swift UVOT $uvw2$ band to the $H$ band, we
estimate a photometric redshift of $z=1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$, consistent with the
pseudo redshift reported by Pelangeon & Atteia (2008) based on the gamma-ray

ionized at the gold-vacuum interface and Fr+ ions are then transported with a 3
keV electrostatic beamline to a cell for neutralization and capture in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT). A Rb+ beam is also available, which follows the
same path as Fr+ ions. The accelerated ions are focused and implanted in a 25

are released as neutrals, since the Y work function is lower than the alkali
ionization energies. The time evolution of the MOT and the vapor fluorescence

1569, one of the closest and strongest nearby starburst galaxies. These data
allow us, for the first time, to unequivocally detect the tip of the red giant
branch and thereby determine the distance to NGC 1569. We find that this galaxy
is 3.36 +/- 0.20 Mpc away, considerably farther away than the typically assumed
distance of 2.2 +/- 0.6 Mpc. Previously thought to be an isolated galaxy due to
its shorter distance, our new distance firmly establishes NGC 1569 as a member
of the IC 342 group of galaxies. The higher density environment may help
explain the starburst nature of NGC 1569, since starbursts are often triggered
by galaxy interactions. On the other hand, the longer distance implies that NGC
1569 is an even more extreme starburst galaxy than previously believed.
Previous estimates of the rate of star formation for stars younger than ~ 1 Gyr
become stronger by more than a factor of 2. Stars older than this were not
constrained by previous studies. The dynamical masses of NGC 1569's three super
star clusters, which are already known as some of the most massive ever
discovered, increase by ~53% to 6-7x10^5 solar masses.

the majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose
topology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with
polynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient

extremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the
network and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path
each round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this
path may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key
setting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the
amount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves
optimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our
protocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is
reliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making
decisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at
any time.

violated in this process. This is because the charge that has been examined in

the conformal dimension spectrum of single trace operators. We first revisit
the Yang-Baxter equation for a spin chain system associated with the single

parity symmetry breaking. We construct two-parameter family of parity
non-invariant, alternating spin chain Hamiltonian involving three-site

the Hamiltonian derived from Yang-Baxter equation, but to the one preserving

affecting the overall interpretation. Suzaku observations for two of the more

stellar populations in massive globular clusters (GCs) has emerged, including
extreme horizontal branches (EHBs) and UV excess. Our goal is to improve our
understanding of UV excess in the regime of both massive GCs and ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies (UCDs). To this end, we use deep archival GALEX data of the
central Fornax cluster to measure NUV and FUV magnitudes of UCDs and massive
GCs. We obtain NUV photometry for a sample of 35 compact objects with
-13.5<M_V<-10 mag. Of those, 21 objects also have FUV photometry. Roughly half
of the sources fall into the UCD luminosity regime (M_V <=-11 mag). We find
that seven out of 17 massive Fornax GCs exhibit a NUV excess with respect to
expectations from stellar population models, even for models with enhanced
Helium abundance. This suggests that not only He-enrichment has contributed to
forming the EHB population of these GCs. The GCs extend to stronger UV excess
than GCs in M31 and massive GCs in M87, at the 97% confidence level. Most of
the UCDs with FUV photometry also show evidence for UV excess, but their UV
colours can be matched by isochrones with enhanced Helium abundances and old
ages 12-14 Gyrs. We find that Fornax compact objects with X-ray emission
detected from Chandra images are almost disjunct in colour from compact objects
with GALEX UV detection, with only one X-ray source among the 35 compact
objects. However, since this source is one of the three most UV bright GCs, we
cannot exclude that the physical processes causing X-ray emission also
contribute to some of the observed UV excess.

the strength of gravitational lensing. The distribution of Einstein radii near
the upper cutoff should probe the largest mass concentrations in the universe.
Adopting a triaxial halo model, we compute expected distributions of large
Einstein radii. To assess the cosmic variance, we generate a number of all-sky
Monte-Carlo realisations. We find that the expected largest Einstein radius in
the universe is sensitive to the cosmological model: for a source redshift z=1,
they are 42^{+9}_{-7}, 35^{+8}_{-6}, and 54^{+12}_{-7} arcseconds, assuming
best-fit parameters of the WMAP5, WMAP3 and WMAP1 data, respectively. These
values are broadly consistent with current observations given their
incompleteness. For the same source redshift, we expect in all-sky 35 (WMAP5),
15 (WMAP3), and 150 (WMAP1) clusters that have Einstein radii larger than 20"".
Whilst the values of the largest Einstein radii are almost unaffected by the
primordial non-Gaussianity currently of interest, the abundance of large lens
clusters should probe non-Gaussianity competitively with CMB, but only if other
cosmological parameters are well-measured. We also find that these ""superlens""
clusters constitute a highly biased population. For instance, a substantial
fraction of these superlens clusters have major axes preferentially aligned
with the line-of-sight. As a consequence, the projected mass distributions of
the clusters are rounder by an ellipticity of 0.2 and have 40%-60% larger
concentrations compared with typical clusters with similar redshifts and
masses. We argue that the large concentration measured in A1689 is consistent
with our model prediction at the 1.2\sigma level. (Abridged)

Myr ago within the inner 4 kpc and that a younger burst happened in the last 10
Myr mostly at galactocentric radii between 4 and 8 kpc. We analyze the stellar
populations residing in the known HI holes of IC2574. Our results indicate
that, even at the remarkable photometric depth of the LBT data, there is no
clear one-to-one association between the observed HI holes and the most recent
bursts of star formation in IC2574. The stellar populations formed during the
younger burst are usually located at the periphery of the HI holes and are seen
to be younger than the holes dynamical age. The kinetic energy of the holes
expansion is found to be on average 10% of the total stellar energy released by
the stellar winds and supernova explosions of the young stellar populations
within the holes. With the help of control apertures distributed across the

We find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretion
rates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation rates
observed in z~2 disks. On the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in the
Millennium Simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts of
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in support of observational evidence that these
are major mergers. When following the fate of these two populations in the
Millennium Simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequent
enough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0.
Similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact SMGs/red sequence galaxies at
z~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. We argue therefore, that
secular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution of
a significant fraction of z~2 UV-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxy

pure DM, PDM model, respectively) are advanced from identical initial
conditions. The DM cusp properties are contrasted by a direct comparison of
pure DM and baryonic models. We find a divergent evolution between the PDM and
BDM models within the inner ~10 kpc region. The PDM model forms a R^{-1} cusp
as expected, while the DM in the BDM model forms a larger isothermal cusp
R^{-2} instead. The isothermal cusp is stable until z~1 when it gradually
levels off. This leveling proceeds from inside out and the final density slope
is shallower than -1 within the central 3 kpc (i.e., expected size of the
R^{-1} cusp), tending to a flat core within ~2 kpc. This effect cannot be
explained by a finite resolution of our code which produces only a 5%
difference between the gravitationally softened force and the exact Newtonian
force of point masses at 1 kpc from the center. Neither is it related to the
energy feedback from stellar evolution or angular momentum transfer from the
bar. Instead it can be associated with the action of DM+baryon subhalos heating
up the cusp region via dynamical friction and forcing the DM in the cusp to
flow out and to `cool' down. The process described here is not limited to low z
and can be efficient at intermediate and even high z.

scenario is that the Higgs is lighter than the LEP2 bound and is consistent

technique to image transparent living samples in three dimensions without
staining. Contrary to conventional microscopy with incoherent light, which
gives morphological information only, diffraction microtomography makes it
possible to obtain the complex optical refractive index of the observed sample
by mapping a three-dimensional support in the spatial frequency domain. The
technique can be implemented in two configurations, namely, by varying the
sample illumination with a fixed sample or by rotating the sample using a fixed
illumination. In the literature, only the former method was described in
detail. In this report, we precisely derive the three-dimensional frequency
support that can be mapped by the sample rotation configuration. We found that,
within the first-order Born approximation, the volume of the frequency domain
that can be mapped exhibits a missing part, the shape of which resembles that
of an apple core. The projection of the diffracted waves in the frequency space
onto the set of sphere caps covered by the sample rotation does not allow for a
complete mapping of the frequency along the axis of rotation due to the finite
radius of the sphere caps. We present simulations of the effects of this
missing information on the reconstruction of ideal objects.

fundamental difficulties on small, galactic scales. One such difficulty is the
cusp/core problem. High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark
matter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark
matter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body
structure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at
the center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar
feedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However,
strong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic
halos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of
the rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo
mass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational
results for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey
(CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS). The
lensing probabilities based on such density profiles are too low to match the
observed lensing in CLASS/JVAS. High baryon densities in the galaxies that
dominate the lensing statistics can reconcile this discrepancy, but only if
they steepen the mass profile rather than making it more shallow. This places
contradictory demands upon the effects of baryons on the central mass profiles
of galaxies.

node-disjoint parallel relaying paths. Generalizations of these networks
include KPP(I) networks, which permit interference between paths and KPP(D)
networks, which possess a direct link between source and sink. We characterize
the DMT of these families of networks completely and show that they can achieve
the cut-set bound, thus proving that full-duplex performance can be obtained
even in the presence of the half-duplex constraint. We then consider layered
networks, and prove that a linear DMT between maximum diversity and maximum
multiplexing gain is achievable. All protocols in this paper are explicit and
use only amplify-and-forward relaying. We also construct codes that achieve the
optimal DMT for all the proposed schemes. Two key implications of the results
in the paper are that the half-duplex constraint does not entail any rate loss
for a large class of cooperative networks and that AF protocols are often
optimal.

outflows on the accretion flow are parametrized and a saturated form of thermal
conduction, as is appropriate for the weakly-collisional regime of interest, is
included in our model. While the cooling effect of outflows is noticeable,
thermal conduction provides an extra heating source. In comparison to accretion
flows without winds, we show that the disc rotates faster and becomes cooler
because of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by the
winds. But thermal conduction opposes the effects of winds and not only
decreases the rotational velocity, but increases the temperature. However,
reduction of the surface density and the enhanced accretion velocity are
amplified by both of the winds and the thermal conduction. We find that for
stronger outflows, a higher level of saturated thermal conduction is needed to
significantly modify the physical profiles of the accretion flow.

characteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly
parallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric
block cipher - the reason for the phrase ""A Public Key Block Cipher"" in the
title of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the
algorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo
-- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores
and OpenMP 2.0 library. However, implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA that is
running on 249.4 MHz it achieves decryption throughput of 399 Mbps, and
implemented on four Xilinx Virtex-5 chips that are running on 276.7 MHz it
achieves encryption throughput of 44.27 Gbps. Compared to fastest RSA
implementations on similar FPGA platforms, MQQ algorithm is more than 10,000

evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here a sample of 1290 AGN, selected
in the 2-10 keV band from different flux-limited surveys with very high optical
identification completeness is studied. The AGN are grouped into two classes,
unabsorbed (type-1) and absorbed (type-2), depending on their optical
spectroscopic classification and X-ray absorption properties, using hardness
ratios. Utilizing the optical to X-ray flux ratios, a rough correction for the
~8% redshift incompleteness still present in the sample is applied. A strong
decrease of the absorbed fraction with X-ray luminosity is found. This can be
represented by an almost linear decrease from ~80% to ~20% in the luminosity
range log L_X=42-46 and is consistent with similar derivations in the optical
and MIR bands. A significant increase of the absorbed fraction with redshift is
found, which can be described by a power law with a slope ~(1+z)^{0.62+/-0.11},
saturating at a redshift of z~2. A simple power law fit ~(1+z)^{0.48+/-0.08}
over the whole redshift is also marginally consistent with the data. The
variation of the AGN absorption with luminosity and redshift is described with
higher statistical accuracy and smaller systematic errors than previous
results. The findings have important consequences for the broader context of
AGN and galaxy co-evolution. Here it is proposed that the cosmic downsizing in
the AGN population is due to two different feeding mechanisms: a fast process
of merger driven accretion at high luminosities and high redshifts versus a
slow process of gas accretion from gravitational instabilities in galactic
disks rebuilding around pre-formed bulges and black holes.

number of research efforts aimed at providing an autonomous solution to the
powering of small-scale electronic mobile devices. Among the different
solutions, vibration energy harvesting has played a major role due to the
almost universal presence of mechanical vibrations: from ground shaking to
human movements, from ambient sound to thermal noise. Standard approaches are
mainly based on resonant linear oscillators that are acted on by ambient
vibrations. Here we propose a new method based on the exploitation of the
dynamical features of stochastic nonlinear oscillators. Such a method is shown
to outperform standard linear oscillators and to overcome some of the most
severe limitations of present approaches, like narrow bandwidth, need for
continuous frequency tuning and low efficiency. We demonstrate the superior
performances of this method by applying it to piezoelectric energy harvesting
from ambient vibration. Experimental results from a toy-model oscillator are
described in terms of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. We prove that the method
proposed here is quite general in principle and could be applied to a wide
class of nonlinear oscillators and different energy conversion principles.
There are also potentials for realizing micro/nano-scale power generators.
