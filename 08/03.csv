Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC) is situated, the Saharan Air
Layer (SAL) can cause strong atmospheric absorption affecting the data quality

atmospheric absorption are performed on La Palma. From the determined
transmission, a correction factor is calculated and applied to the MAGIC data.
The different transmission measurements from optical and IACT data provide
comparable results. MAGIC data of PG 1553+113, taken during a MWL campaign in

phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: phylogenetic trees,
Hennig trees and Nelson cladograms. All three models are trees, as that term is
commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the
biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and
Hennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these
two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other
hand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different
mathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For
each phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same
information, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves
necessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it
is necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of
a Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One
possibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the
edges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little
more than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint
of phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson
cladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of
synapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.

These sensors employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies and communicate to a
central fusion center by one shot schemes. One shot schemes are schemes in
which the sensors communicate with the fusion center only once, after which
they must signal a detection. The communication is clearly asynchronous and the
case is considered in which the fusion center employs a minimal strategy, which
means that it declares an alarm when the first communication takes place. It is
assumed that the observations received at the sensors are independent and that
the time points at which the appearance of a signal can take place are
different. It is shown that there is no loss of performance of one shot schemes
as compared to the centralized case in an extended Lorden min-max sense, since
the minimum of N CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean time between
false alarms increases without bound.

signal. This generalizes our previous study (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 206802
(2005); J. Chem. Phys. 124, 234709 (2006)) of junction spectroscopy by
including molecular vibrations and developing machinery for calculation of
state-to-state (Raman scattering) fluxes within the NEGF formalism. For large
enough voltage bias we find that the light scattering signal contains, in
addition to the normal signal associated with the molecular ground electronic
state, also a contribution from the inverse process originated from the excited
molecular state as well as an interference component. The effect of coupling to
the electrodes and of the imposed bias on the total Raman scattering as well as
its components are discussed. Our result reduces to the standard expression for
Raman scattering in the isolated molecule case, i.e. in the absence of coupling
to the electrodes. The theory is used to discuss the charge transfer
contribution to surface enhanced Raman scattering for molecules adsorbed on
metal surfaces and its manifestation in the biased junction.

the metric is not a quantum field, nor does it contribute propagators to the

decision-making in political bodies as well as collaboration and surplus
division in multiagent domains. The computational complexity of various
solution concepts for weighted voting games received a lot of attention in
recent years. In particular, Elkind et al.(2007) studied the complexity of
stability-related solution concepts in WVGs, namely, of the core, the least

algorithmic complexity of the core and the least core, for the nucleolus they

the nucleolus and runs in time polynomial in the number of players and the

for which non-singular solutions of the normalized Ricci flow exist, but also
admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures for which {\it no}
non-singular solution of the normalized Ricci flow exists.
  Related non-existence results on non-singular solutions are also proved.
Among others, we show that there are no non-singular $\ZZ_d-$equivariant
solutions to the normalized Ricci flow on appropriate connected sums of $\bcp

as a generalization of the Widder potential transform and the Glasser
transform. The $\mathcal{P}_{\nu,2}$-transform is obtained as an iteration of
the the $\mathcal{L}_{2}$-transform with itself. Many identities involving
these transforms are given. By making use of these identities, a number of new
Parseval-Goldstein type identities are obtained for these and many other
well-known integral transforms. The identities proven in this paper are shown
to give rise to useful corollaries for evaluating infinite integrals of special
functions. Some examples are also given as illustration of the results

account for crossing of the phantom divide line. This crossing, which is
possible for both branches of the scenario, depends explicitly on the values of
the non-minimal coupling and warp factor. The effect of warp factor appears in
the value of the redshift parameter at which phantom divide line crossing

reaction and metabolite nodes. Here it is shown how a network of conserved

fluxes with a conserved metabolite property such as molecular weight. A similar
flux network can be constructed by combining the primal and dual solutions to
the linear programming problem that typically arises in constraint-based
modelling. Such constructions may help with the visualisation of flux
distributions in complex metabolic networks. The analysis also explains the
strong correlation observed between metabolite shadow prices (the dual linear

applied to recent metabolic models for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces

linear elastic fracture mechanics where nonlinearities are neglected. However,
recent experimental and theoretical work demonstrated explicitly the importance
of elastic nonlinearities in fracture dynamics. We study two simple
one-dimensional models of fracture in order to gain insights about the role of
elastic nonlinearities and the implications of their exclusion in the common
linear elastic approximation. In one model we consider the decohesion of a
nonlinear elastic membrane from a substrate. In a second model we follow the
philosophy of linear elastic fracture mechanics and study a linearized version
of the nonlinear model. By analyzing the steady state solutions, the
velocity-load relations and the response to perturbations of the two models we
show that the linear approximation fails at finite crack tip velocities. We
highlight certain features of the breakdown of the linear theory and discuss
possible implications of our results to higher dimensional systems.

on single crystals of EuFe$_2$As$_2$, a parent compound of ferro-arsenide
high-temperature superconductor. Apart from the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
spin-density-wave transition at 186 K associated with Fe moments, the compound
undergoes another magnetic phase transition at 19 K due to AFM ordering of
Eu$^{2+}$ spins ($J=S=7/2$). The latter AFM state exhibits metamagnetic
transition under magnetic fields. Upon applying magnetic field with $H\parallel
c$ at 2 K, the magnetization increases linearly to 7.0 $\mu_{B}$/f.u. at
$\mu_{0}H$=1.7 T, then keeps at this value of saturated Eu$^{2+}$ moments under
higher fields. In the case of $H\parallel ab$, the magnetization increases
step-like to 6.6 $\mu_{B}$/f.u. with small magnetic hysteresis. A metamagnetic
phase was identified with the saturated moments of 4.4 $\mu_{B}$/f.u. The
metamagnetic transition accompanies with negative in-plane magnetoresistance,
reflecting the influence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments ordering on the electrical
conduction of FeAs layers. The results were explained in terms of
spin-reorientation and spin-reversal based on an $A$-type AFM structure for
Eu$^{2+}$ spins. The magnetic phase diagram has been established.

Slight Zn doping in LaFe$_{1-x}$Zn$_{x}$AsO drastically suppresses the
resistivity anomaly around 150 K associated with the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
spin density wave (SDW) in the parent compound. The measurements of magnetic
susceptibility and thermopower confirm further the effect of Zn doping on AFM
order. Meanwhile Zn doping does not affect or even enhances the $T_c$ of
LaFe$_{1-x}$Zn$_{x}$AsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$, in contrast to the effect of Zn
doping in high-$T_c$ cuprates. We found that the solubility of Zn content ($x$)
is limited to less than 0.1 in both systems and further Zn doping (i.e., $x$
$\geq$ 0.1) causes phase separation. Our study clearly indicates that the
non-magnetic impurity of Zn$^{2+}$ ions doped in the Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers
affects selectively the AFM order, and superconductivity remains robust against
the Zn doping in the F-doped superconductors.
