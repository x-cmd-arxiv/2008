phenomena and unconventional superconductivity. These usually occur in the
context of competing interactions in systems of strongly-correlated electrons.
All this interesting physics comes together in the behavior of the recently
discovered iron pnictide compounds that have generated enormous interest
because of their moderately high-temperature superconductivity. The ubiquity of
antiferromagnetic ordering in their phase diagrams naturally raises the
question of the relevance of magnetic quantum criticality, but the answer
remains uncertain both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show that the
undoped iron pnictides feature a novel type of magnetic quantum critical point,
which results from a competition between electronic localization and
itinerancy. Our theory provides a mechanism to understand the
experimentally-observed variation of the ordered moment among the undoped iron
pnictides. We suggest P substitution for As in the undoped iron pnictides as a
means to access this new example of magnetic quantum criticality in an unmasked
fashion. Our findings point to the iron pnictides as a much-needed new setting
for quantum criticality, one that offers a new set of control parameters.

UCD3, the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) results in the stellar mass
significantly exceeding the dynamical one, whereas for the Kroupa IMF the
values coincide. Although, this object may have peculiar dynamics or/and

between plastic deformation and fracture in brittle solids. The competition can
be sketched by a critical size of the material, which characterizes the

good approximation of the critical size through an extrapolation from the
macroscopic to the microscopic scales. Nanoindentation tests confirm this
experimental value. According to the grain size compared to the indent size, it
can reasonably be said that the mode of damage is deformation-induced
intragranular microfracture. This technique also enables to perform cyclic
indentations to examine calcite fatigue resistance. Repeated loadings with a
nanoindenter on CaCO3 polycrystalline samples produce cumulative mechanical
damage. It is also shown that the transition between ductile and brittle
behaviour depends on the number of indentation cycles. The ductile domain can
be reduced when the material is exposed to a fatigue process.

the (1/2 1/2 1/2) antiferromagnetic magnetic peak measured both by neutron and

background (CMB) anisotropy maps of WMAP. One of these is a lack of large-scale
power. Because the data otherwise match standard models extremely well, it is
natural to consider perturbations of the standard model as possible
explanations. We show that, as long as the source of the perturbation is
statistically independent of the source of the primary CMB anisotropy, no such
model can explain this large-scale power deficit. On the contrary, any such
perturbation always reduces the probability of obtaining any given low value of
large-scale power. We rigorously prove this result when the lack of large-scale
power is quantified with a quadratic statistic, such as the quadrupole moment.
When a statistic based on the integrated square of the correlation function is
used instead, we present strong numerical evidence in support of the result.
The result applies to models in which the geometry of spacetime is perturbed
(e.g., an ellipsoidal Universe) as well as explanations involving local
contaminants, undiagnosed foregrounds, or systematic errors. Because the
large-scale power deficit is arguably the most significant of the observed
anomalies, explanations that worsen this discrepancy should be regarded with
great skepticism, even if they help in explaining other anomalies such as
multipole alignments.

new technique for software maintenance, effective tool support is typically
required to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
However, even though tool building is both pervasive and requiring significant
time and effort, it is still pursued in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we
address these issues by proposing a dedicated development process for tool
building that takes the unique characteristics of an academic research
environment into account. We first identify process requirements based on a
review of the literature and our extensive tool building experience in the
domain of maintenance tools. We then outline a process framework based on work
products that accommodates the requirements while providing needed flexibility
for tailoring the process to account for specific tool building approaches and
project constraints. The work products are concrete milestones of the process,
tracking progress, rationalizing (design) decisions, and documenting the
current state of the tool building project. Thus, the work products provide
important input for strategic project decisions and rapid initiation of new
team members. Leveraging a dedicated tool building process promises tools that
are designed, build, and maintained in a more disciplined, predictable and
efficient manner.

45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.3 using IRC onboard
the AKARI satellite. This paper investigates whether the luminosities of these
ULIRGs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried AGNs
are energetically important. Our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3
micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the optical
depths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains and
at 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. Because of the AKARI IRC's
spectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffected
by Earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ULIRGs at
z > 0.15. We estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),
modestly obscured (Av < 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron PAH
emission luminosities measured in AKARI IRC slitless spectra, and confirm that
such starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ULIRGs. In roughly half
of the observed ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts, we find signatures
of luminous energy sources that produce no PAH emission and/or are more
centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. We interpret these energy
sources as buried AGNs. The fraction of ULIRGs with detectable buried AGN
signatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. Our overall results
support the scenario that luminous buried AGNs are important in many ULIRGs at
z < 0.3 classified optically as non-Seyferts, and that the optical
undetectability of such buried AGNs occurs merely because of a large amount of
nuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust column
density opaque to the ionizing radiation of the AGNs.

centrally peaked and has a roughly spherically symmetrical distribution. This
shows that HCN is formed in the innermost region of the envelope (within ~10
stellar radii), which is consistent with predictions from pulsation-driven
shock chemistry models, and rules out the scenario in which HCN forms through
photochemical reactions in the outer envelope. Our model suggests that the
envelope decreases steeply in temperature and increases smoothly in velocity
with radius, inconsistent with the standard model for mass-loss driven by
radiative pressure on dust grains. We detect a velocity gradient of ~5 km/s in
the NW--SE direction over the central 40 AU. This velocity gradient is
reminescent of that seen in OH maser lines, and could be caused by the rotation
of the envelope or by a weak bipolar outflow.

first-passage processes in financial markets. The view-point of renewal theory
is assumed. In order to represent market data with relatively long durations,
two types of distributions are used, namely, a distribution derived from the
so-called Mittag-Leffler survival function and the Weibull distribution. For
Mittag-Leffler type distribution, the average waiting time (residual life time)
is strongly dependent on the choice of a cut-off parameter t_ max, whereas the
results based on the Weibull distribution do not depend on such a cut-off.
Therefore, a Weibull distribution is more convenient than a Mittag-Leffler type
one if one wishes to evaluate relevant statistics such as average waiting time
in financial markets with long durations. On the other side, we find that the
Gini index is rather independent of the cut-off parameter. Based on the above
considerations, we propose a good candidate for describing the distribution of
first-passage time in a market: The Weibull distribution with a power-law tail.
This distribution compensates the gap between theoretical and empirical results
much more efficiently than a simple Weibull distribution. We also give a useful
formula to determine an optimal crossover point minimizing the difference
between the empirical average waiting time and the one predicted from renewal
theory. Moreover, we discuss the limitation of our distributions by applying
our distribution to the analysis of the BTP future and calculating the average
waiting time. We find that our distribution is applicable as long as durations
follow a Weibull-law for short times and do not have too heavy a tail.

model. The volume averaging became of considerable interest after it was shown
that the volume acceleration calculated within the averaging framework can be
positive even though the local expansion rate is always decelerating. This
issue was intensively studied within spherically symmetric models. However,
since our Universe is not spherically symmetric similar analysis is needed in
non symmetrical models. This papers presents the averaging analysis within the
quasispherical Szekeres model which is a non-symmetrical generalisation of the
spherically symmetric Lema\^itre--Tolman family of models. Density distribution
in the quasispherical Szekeres has a structure of a time-dependent mass dipole
superposed on a monopole. This paper shows that when calculating the volume
acceleration, $\ddot{a}$, within the Szekeres model, the dipole does not
contribute to the final result, hence $\ddot{a}$ only depends on a monopole
configuration. Thus, the volume averaging within the Szekeres model leads to
literally the same solutions as obtained within the Lema\^itre--Tolman model.

hydrodynamics to follow the dynamical evolution from the collapse of
pre-supernova models of 40Msun and 50Msun toward the black hole formation via
contracting proto-neutron stars. For the three progenitor models studied in

core bounce through the increase of proto-neutron star mass together with the
short and energetic neutrino burst. We found that density profile of progenitor
is important to determine the accretion rate onto the proto-neutron star and,
therefore, the duration of neutrino burst. We compare the neutrino bursts of
black hole forming events from different progenitors and discuss whether we can
probe clearly the progenitor and/or the dense matter.

The study is based on the first hydro-simulations of cluster formation for
diferent models of dark energy. We present results for four dark energy models
which differ from each other by their equations of state parameter, $w$.
Namely, we use a cosmological constant model $w=-1$ (as a reference), a perfect
fluid with constant equation of state parameter $w=-0.8$ and one with $w =
-1.2$ and a scalar field model (or quintessence) with varying $w$. We generate
N-body/hydrodynamic simulations that include radiative cooling with the public
version of the Hydra code, modified to consider an arbitrary dark energy

on how to minimize such a loss of entanglement in open quantum systems. We find
that the quantum entanglement of general two-qubit systems with controllable

can be protected, even for a long time. We apply our proposal to several types
of two-qubit superconducting circuits, and show how the entanglement of these

evolution of their harboring galaxy.
  Methods we used are based on optical spectroscopy of visually bright quasars,
many of which have recently been discovered as X-ray sources, but eventually
missed in color-selected surveys. The spectra typically cover the 4200-7000 AA
region, allowing measurements of the characteristics of the hydrogen lines, the
FeII contribution, and other lines of interest.

objects. We also show that the contribution of the host galaxy to the optical
continuum is non-negligible in many cases, as is the intrinsic AGN absorption.
Consequences of not correcting for those factors when estimating different
quasar parameters are discussed. We also find some evidence of a non-unity
slope in the relation between the internal extinction based on the Balmer
decrement and the one on the optical continuum slope, implying, if further
confirmed, the intriguing possibility that some absorbing material might
actually be located between the continuum source and the broad-line region.

wave, rectified sine wave, and modulus of sine wave. An analytical threshold
condition for the onset of horseshoe chaos is obtained in the Duffing
oscillator driven by various periodic forces using the Melnikov method.
Melnikov threshold curve is drawn in a parameter space. For all the forces
except modulus of sine wave, the onset of cross-well asymptotic chaos is
observed just above the Melnikov threshold curve for onset of horseshoe chaos.
For the modulus of sine wave long time transient motion followed by a periodic
attractor is realized. The possibility of controlling of horseshoe and
asymptotic chaos in the Duffing oscillator by an addition of second periodic
force is then analyzed. Parametric regimes where suppression of horseshoe chaos
occurs are predicted. Analytical prediction is demonstrated through direct
numerical simulations. Starting from asymptotic chaos we show the recovery of
periodic motion for a range of values of amplitude and phase of the second

distribution function. By global analyses of polarized lepton-nucleon
scattering and the $\pi^0$-production data, polarized parton distribution

method. Two types of the gluon distribution function are investigated. One is a
positive distribution and the other is a node-type distribution which changes
sign at $x \sim 0.1$. Although the RHIC $\pi^0$ data seem to favor the node
type for $\Delta g(x)$, it is difficult to determine a precise functional form
from the current data. However, it is interesting to find that the gluon
distribution $\Delta g(x)$ is positive at large $x$ ($>0.2$) due to constraints
from the scaling violation in $g_1$ and RHIC $\pi^0$ data. The JLab-E07-011
measurements for $g_1^d$ should be also able to reduce the gluon uncertainty,
and the reduction is comparable to the one by RUN-5 $\pi^0$-production data at
RHIC. The reduction is caused by the error correlation between polarized
antiquark and gluon distributions and by a next-to-leading-order (NLO) gluonic
effect in the structure function $g_1^d$. We find that the JLab-E07-011 data
are accurate enough to probe the NLO gluonic term in $g_1$. Both RHIC and JLab

addition to improvement on polarized quark and antiquark distributions.

of the CMB anisotropy for local type of non-Gaussianity, from which the optimal
estimator in the general case (inhomogeneous noise and cut sky) is obtained.
The new estimator obtained here is different from the popular one, since the
inhomogeneous noise and cut sky effects are completely accounted. The CMB
anisotropy in the new estimator is noise weighted. The noise weight is
different from that used by WMAP Group in their 5-year data analysis. Although
it is still difficult to calculate the new estimator rigorously, for the case
of the slightly inhomogeneous noise, there exists a series expansion method to
compute the new estimator. Each order in the series is suppressed by two
factors, $(\frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2_{i}}-1)$ and $\frac{C_l}{C^{tot}_{l}}$,
which make the method feasible. Through the Edgeworth expansion we can
generalize our discussion to other types of non-Gaussianity.

the mass $m$ of a body is equivalent to its rest energy $E_0$. At the same time
he frequently resorted to the less clear-cut statement of equivalence of energy

known than its popular form, $E=mc^2$, in which $E$ is the total energy equal
to the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy of a freely moving body.
One of the consequences of this is the widespread fallacy that the mass of a
body increases when its velocity increases and even that this is an

Searchable sets are exhaustible, and we show that the converse also holds for

moreover, a selection functional can be constructed uniformly from a

intersections with decidable sets, and under the formation of computable images

established here, that exhaustible sets are topologically compact. We obtain a

galaxies 3C 305, DA 240, and 4C 73.08, and investigate the origin of their
nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclei of the three sources appear to have
different relative contributions of accretion- and jet-related X-ray emission,
as expected based on earlier work. The X-ray spectrum of the FRII narrow-line
radio galaxy (NLRG) 4C 73.08 is modeled with the sum of a heavily absorbed
power law that we interpret to be associated with a luminous accretion disk and
circumnuclear obscuring structure, and an unabsorbed power law that originates
in an unresolved jet. This behavior is consistent with other narrow-line radio
galaxies. The X-ray emission of the low-excitation FRII radio galaxy DA 240 is
best modeled as an unabsorbed power law that we associate with a parsec-scale
jet, similar to other low-excitation sources that we have studied previously.
However, the X-ray nucleus of the narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 305 shows no
evidence for the heavily absorbed X-ray emission that has been found in other
NLRGs. It is possible that the nuclear optical spectrum in 3C 305 is
intrinsically weak-lined, with the strong emission arising from extended
regions that indicate the presence of jet--environment interactions. Our
observations of 3C 305 suggest that this source is more closely related to
other weak-lined radio galaxies. This ambiguity could extend to other sources
currently classified as NLRGs. We also present XMM-Newton and VLA observations
of the hotspot of DA 240, arguing that this is another detection of X-ray
synchrotron emission from a low-luminosity hotspot.

bulk or at the surface of a one-dimensional linear lattice. Exact expressions
are obtained for the bound state profile and energy. Dynamical excitation of
the localized mode reveals exponentially-high amplitude oscillations of the
spatial profile at the impurity location. The presence of a surface increases
the minimum nonlinearity to effect a dynamical selftrapping.
