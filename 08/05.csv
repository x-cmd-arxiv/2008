function G(x, Q^2) = xg(x, Q^2) in terms of the proton structure function
F_2^{\gamma p} (x, Q^2) in leading-order (LO) QCD by solving the the LO DGLAP
equation for the Q^2 evolution of F_2^{\gamma p} (x, Q^2) analytically, using a
differential-equation method. We re-derive and extend the results here using a
Laplace-transform technique, and show that the singlet quark structure function
F_S(x,Q^2) can be determined directly in terms of G from the DGLAP gluon
evolution equation. To illustrate the method and check the consistency of
existing LO quark and gluon distributions, we used the published values of the
LO quark distributions from the CTEQ5L and MRST2001LO analyses to form
F_2^{\gamma p} (x, Q^2), and then solved analytically for G(x,Q^2). We find
that the analytic and fitted gluon distributions from MRST2001LO agree well
with each other for all x and Q^2, while those from CTEQ5L differ significantly
from each other for large x values, x>~0.03 - 0.05 at all Q^2. We conclude that
the published CTEQ5L distributions are incompatible in this region. Using a
non-singlet evolution equation, we obtain a sensitive test of quark
distributions which holds in both LO and NLO perturbative QCD. We find in
either case that the CTEQ5 quark distributions satisfy the tests numerically
for small x, but fail the tests for x>~0.03 - 0.05 - their use could
potentially lead to significant shifts in predictions of quantities sensitive
to large x. We encountered no problems with the MRST2001LO distributions or
later CTEQ distributions. We suggest caution in the use of the CTEQ5
distributions.

Chemical Equilibria (DTD), developed by the author during the last decade and
spread over series of publications. Based on the linear equations of
irreversible thermodynamics, De Donder's definition of the thermodynamic force,
and the Le Chatelier principle, DTD brings forward a notion of chemical
equilibrium as a balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting
against a chemical system. The basic expression of DTD is a logistic map that
ties together energetic characteristics of the chemical transformation in the
system, its deviation from true thermodynamic equilibrium, and the sum of
thermodynamic forces, causing that deviation. System deviation from
thermodynamic equilibrium is the major variable of the theory. Solutions to the
basic map define the chemical system domain of states comprising bifurcation
diagrams with four areas, from true thermodynamic equilibrium to chaos, having
specific distinctive meaning for chemical systems. The theory is derived from
the currently recognized ideas of chemical thermodynamics and binds classical
and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria into a unique concept.
DTD opens new opportunities in understanding and analysis of equilibria in
chemical systems. Some new results, included in the paper, have never been
published before.

spin-transfer to be measured. The effect of a strong spin-polarized current
injected on a ferromagnetic nanostructure is investigated with focusing on the
quasi-static equilibrium states of a ferromagnetic single domain. The samples
are single contacted Ni nanowires obtained by electrodeposition in a nanoporous
template. The thermal susceptibility of the magnetoresistance is measured as a
function of the magnetic field for different values of the current injected
through the wire. This quantity is related to the thermal magnetic
susceptibility of the ferromagnetic wire through the anisotropic
magnetoresistance. The ferromagnetic entropy generated by the current injection
is deduced thanks to a thermodynamic Maxwell relation. This study shows that
the effect of the spin-transfer in our samples results in the generation of
incoherent excitations instead of rotation of the magnetization.

promising candidates, which may consist of 2 brown dwarfs, 2 stars with edge-on
disks, and a low-mass protostar if they are bona fide members. Spectroscopy is

~60% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, respectively. These results are
similar to previous estimates of disk fractions in IC 348 and Cha I, which have
roughly the same median ages as Sigma Ori (3 Myr). Finally, we note that our
photometric measurements and the sources that we identify as having disks
differ significantly from those of other recent studies that analyzed the same
Spitzer images. For instance, previous work has suggested that the T dwarf S
Ori 70 is redder than typical field dwarfs, which has been cited as possible
evidence of youth and cluster membership. However, we find that this object is
only slightly redder than the reddest field dwarfs in [3.6]-[4.5] (1.56+/-0.07

0.87-1.19), but the flux at 5.8um may be overestimated because of the low
signal-to-noise ratio of the detection. Thus, the Spitzer data do not offer
strong evidence of youth and membership for this object, which is the faintest
and coolest candidate member of Sigma Ori that has been identified to date.

Accurate measurements of $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ requires stiff polymers with small

persistence length. Paradoxically, reliable estimates of the hopping rates can
only be made using flexible handles. Nevertheless, we show that the equilibrium
free energy profile $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ at an external tension $f_m$, the force
($f$) at which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, in
conjunction with Kramers' theory, can provide accurate estimates of the
force-dependent hopping rates in the absence of handles at arbitrary values of
$f$. Our theoretical framework shows that $z_m$ is a good reaction coordinate

  Let $X$ be an infinite set and let $\H$ be a Hilbert space of functions on
$X$ with inner product $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}=\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_{\H}$. We will be
assuming that the Dirac masses $\delta_x$, for $x\in X$, are contained in $\H$.
And we then define an associated operator $\Delta$ in $\H$ given by $$(\Delta

  If $F_1\subset F_2\subset...$ is an ascending sequence of finite subsets such
that $\cup_{k\in\bn}F_k=X$, we are interested in the following two problems:
  (a) obtaining an approximation formula
$$\lim_{k\to\infty}\Delta_{F_k}=\Delta;$$ and

black holes (BHs) play a decisive role in the formation and evolution of
individual galaxies as well as galaxy groups and clusters. In particular, there
is compelling evidence that BHs vigorously interact with their surroundings in
the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating that any realistic model of
cluster formation needs to account for these processes. This is also suggested
by the failure of previous generations of hydrodynamical simulations without BH
physics to simultaneously account for the paucity of strong cooling flows in
clusters, the slope and amplitude of the observed cluster scaling relations,
and the high-luminosity cut-off of central cluster galaxies. Here we use
high-resolution cosmological simulations of a large cluster and group sample to
study how BHs affect their host systems. We focus on two specific properties,
the halo gas fraction and the X-ray luminosity-temperature scaling relation,
both of which are notoriously difficult to reproduce in self-consistent
hydrodynamical simulations. We show that BH feedback can solve both of these
issues, bringing them in excellent agreement with observations, without
alluding to the `cooling only' solution that produces unphysically bright
central galaxies. By comparing a large sample of simulated AGN-heated clusters
with observations, our new simulation technique should make it possible to
reliably calibrate observational biases in cluster surveys, thereby enabling
various high-precision cosmological studies of the dark matter and dark energy

coupling denoted \mu\ell=1. Ordinarily, excitations of AdS3 gravity are known
to transform non-trivially under an asymptotic symmetry group consisting of
both a left-moving and a right-moving conformal group. However it was recently
conjectured in arXiv:0801.4566 that at the chiral point \mu\ell=1 all
excitations are chiral in that they transform only under the right-moving
conformal group. We show herein that at the chiral point, the group of trivial
diffeomorphisms is enhanced to include the left-moving conformal
transformations, and the asymptotic symmetry group contains only one
(right-moving) copy of the conformal group. Diffeomorphism invariance then
requires that all physical excitations are annihilated by left-moving conformal
transformations, establishing nonperturbatively the chiral nature of chiral
gravity.

around the Galactic Center observed by WMAP, known as the ``WMAP Haze'', may be
the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in
dark matter annihilations. In particular, the angular distribution, spectrum,
and intensity of the observed emission are consistent with the signal expected
to result from a WIMP with an electroweak-scale mass and an annihilation cross
section near the value predicted for a thermal relic. In this article, we
revisit this signal within the context of supersymmetry, and evaluate the
parameter space of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(CMSSM). We find that, over much of the supersymmetric parameter space, the
lightest neutralino is predicted to possess the properties required to generate
the WMAP Haze. In particular, the focus point, A-funnel, and bulk regions
typically predict a neutralino with a mass, annihilation cross section, and
dominant annihilation modes which are within the range required to produce the
observed features of the WMAP Haze. The stau-coannihilation region, in
contrast, is disfavored as an explanation for the origin of this signal.

at a time and were enriched only gradually by the first heavy elements.
However, the large box sizes in these models cannot resolve primordial
supernova explosions or the mixing of their metals with ambient gas, which
could result in intervening, prompt generations of low-mass stars. We present
multiscale 1D models of Population III supernovae in cosmological halos that
evolve the blast from its earliest stages as a free expansion. We find that if
the star ionizes the halo, the ejecta strongly interacts with the dense shell
swept up by the H II region, potentially cooling and fragmenting it into clumps
that are unstable to gravitational collapse. If the star fails to ionize the
halo, the explosion propagates metals out to 20 - 40 pc and then collapses,
enriching tens of thousands of solar masses of primordial gas, in contrast to
previous models that suggest such explosions 'fizzle'. Rapid formation of
low-mass stars trapped in the gravitational potential well of the halo appears
to be inevitable in such circumstances. Consequently, it is possible that far
more stars were swept up into the first galaxies, at earlier times and with
distinct chemical signatures, than in present models. Upcoming measurements by
JWST and ALMA may discriminate between these two paradigms.

for amorphous solids as a function of the imposed shear rate and initial
material preparation. The STZ formulation incorporates recent simulation
results [Haxton and Liu, PRL 99 195701 (2007)] showing that the steady state
effective temperature is rate dependent. The resulting model predicts a wide
range of deformation behavior as a function of the initial conditions,
including homogeneous deformation, broad shear bands, extremely thin shear
bands, and the onset of material failure. In particular, the STZ model predicts
homogeneous deformation for shorter quench times and lower strain rates, and
inhomogeneous deformation for longer quench times and higher strain rates. The
location of the transition between homogeneous and inhomogeneous flow on the
deformation map is determined in part by the steady state effective
temperature, which is likely material dependent. This model also suggests that
material failure occurs due to a runaway feedback between shear heating and the
local disorder, and provides an explanation for the thickness of shear bands
near the onset of material failure. We find that this model, which resolves
dynamics within a sheared material interface, predicts that the stress weakens
with strain much more rapidly than a similar model which uses a single state
variable to specify internal dynamics on the interface.

of different masses) and for groups themselves. The conditional stellar mass
function (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos
of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a
log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On
average, there are about 3 times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among
the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue
ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red
galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low mass end. At the
very low-mass end ($M_\ast \la 10^9 h^{-2}\Msun$), however, there is a marked
increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are
located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the
large-scale environments. The stellar-mass function of galaxy groups is well
described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at $\sim
4\times 10^{10}h^{-2}\Msun$. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function

large sample of 725 broad-line AGNs, which consists of 498 radio-loud sources
and 227 radio-quiet sources. Our results are generally consistent with those in
our previous work based on a smaller sample of 115 SDSS AGNs. We confirm that
radio-loud objects have a steeper slope ($\xi_{RX}$) in the radio-X-ray
relationship with respect to radio-quiet objects, and the dependence of the
black hole fundamental plane on the black hole mass ($\xi_{RM}$) is weak. We
also find a tight correlation with a similar slope between the soft X-ray
luminosity and broad emission line luminosity for both radio-loud and
radio-quiet AGNs, which implies that their soft X-ray emission is unbeamed and
probably related to the accretion process. With the current larger sample of
AGNs, we are able to study the redshift evolution of the black hole fundamental
plane relation for both radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples. We find that
there is no clear evidence of evolution for radio-quiet AGNs, while for
radio-loud ones there is a weak trend where $\xi_{RM}$ decreases as the
redshift increases. This may be understood in part as due to the observed
evolution of the radio spectral index as a function of redshift. Finally, we
discuss the relativistic beaming effect and some other uncertainties related to

a magnetic cataclysmic variable (mCV) will be equal at sufficiently high mass
flow rates or for sufficiently weak magnetic fields. At lower mass flow rates
or in stronger magnetic fields, efficient cyclotron cooling will cool the
electrons faster than the electrons can cool the ions and a two-temperature
flow will result. Here we investigate the differences in polarized radiation
expected from mCV post-shock accretion columns modeled with one- and
two-temperature hydrodynamics. In an mCV model with one accretion region, a
magnetic field >~30 MG and a specific mass flow rate of ~0.5 g/cm/cm/s, along
with a relatively generic geometric orientation of the system, we find that in
the ultraviolet either a single linear polarization pulse per binary orbit or
two pulses per binary orbit can be expected, depending on the accretion column
hydrodynamic structure (one- or two-temperature) modeled. Under conditions
where the physical flow is two-temperature, one pulse per orbit is predicted
from a single accretion region where a one-temperature model predicts two
pulses. The intensity light curves show similar pulse behavior but there is
very little difference between the circular polarization predictions of one-
and two-temperature models. Such discrepancies indicate that it is important to
model some aspect of two-temperature flow in indirect imaging procedures, like
Stokes imaging, especially at the edges of extended accretion regions, were the
specific mass flow is low, and especially for ultraviolet data.

proposed to be an intermediate-mass counterpart of a low-mass Class 0 source.
In addition, we obtain absolute proper motions of the H$_{2}$O masers for the
most blue-shifted components. We propose that the collimated jets aligned along
the east-west direction are the most plausible explanation for the origin of
the detected maser features.

upper-bounded by an average of a generalized Chernoff's bound over a code

further replacement by another bound utilizing Jensen's inequality is

theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we
report that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas
streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes
(Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed
abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must
rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading
to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows.
With a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at
a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that
form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike
destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk
configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming
clumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008,
Elmegreen, Bournaud & Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari & Ceverino 2009). This

system with n legitimate users, each with a Bernoulli arrival process is
considered. Packets are temporarily stored at the corresponding user queues,
and a slotted ALOHA strategy is used for packet transmissions over the shared
channel. The scenario considered is that of a pair of illegitimate users that
jam legitimate transmissions in order to communicate over the slotted ALOHA
channel. Jamming leads to binary signaling between the illegitimate users, with
packet collisions due to legitimate users treated as (multiplicative) noise in
this channel. Further, the queueing dynamics at the legitimate users
stochastically couples the jamming strategy used by the illegitimate users and
the channel evolution.
  By considering various i.i.d. jamming strategies, achievable jamming rates
over the slotted ALOHA channel are derived. Further, an upper bound on the
jamming capacity over the class of all ergodic jamming policies is derived.
These bounds are shown to be tight in the limit where the offered system load

density stratification and a prescribed azimuthal magnetic field is considered.
Global nonaxisymmetric solutions of the linearized MHD equations with toroidal
magnetic field, axial density stratification and differential rotation are
found for both insulating and conducting cylinder walls. Flat rotation laws
such as the quasi-Kepler law are unstable against the nonaxisymmetric
stratorotational instability (SRI). The influence of a current-free toroidal
magnetic field depends on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm: SRI is supported by
Pm > 1 and it is suppressed by Pm \lsim 1. For too flat rotation laws a smooth
transition exists to the instability which the toroidal magnetic field produces
in combination with the differential rotation. This nonaxisymmetric azimuthal
magnetorotational instability (AMRI) has been computed under the presence of an
axial density gradient. If the magnetic field between the cylinders is not
current-free then also the Tayler instability occurs and the transition from
the hydrodynamic SRI to the magnetic Tayler instability proves to be rather
complex. Most spectacular is the `ballooning' of the stability domain by the
density stratification: already a rather small rotation stabilizes magnetic
fields against the Tayler instability. An azimuthal component of the resulting
electromotive force only exists for density-stratified flows. The related
alpha-effect for magnetic SRI of Kepler rotation appears to be positive for
negative d\rho/dz <0.

the array into fixed-width vertical strips. Each row in the strip is seen as a

shocks also in relatively under-dense cosmic regions. We derive the
distributions of the number of shocks and of the energy dissipated at these
shocks as a function of their Mach number, and discuss the evolution of these
distributions with cosmological time and across different cosmic environments
(clusters, outskirts, filaments, voids). In line with some previous numerical
studies (e.g. Ryu et al.2003, Pfrommer et al.2006) relatively weak shocks are
found to dominate the process of energy dissipation in the simulated cosmic
volume, although we find a larger ratio between weak and strong shocks with
respect to previous studies. We estimate the rate of injection of CR at Large
Scale Shocks by adopting injection efficiencies taken from previous numerical
calculations. The flux dissipated in the form of CR within the whole simulated
volume at the present epoch is about 20 per cent of the thermal energy
dissipated at shocks; this fraction is smaller within galaxy clusters.

tensor are investigated for twisted and untwisted massive spinor fields in
higher-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial
dimensions. The expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of
corresponding quantities in the uncompactified de Sitter spacetime and the
parts induced by non-trivial topology. The latter are finite and the
renormalization is needed for the first parts only. Closed formulae are derived
for the renormalized fermionic vacuum densities in uncompactified
odd-dimensional de Sitter spacetimes. It is shown that, unlike to the case of
4-dimensional spacetime, for large values of the mass, these densities are
suppressed exponentially. Asymptotic behavior of the topological parts in the
expectation values is investigated in the early and late stages of the
cosmological expansion. When the comoving lengths of compactified dimensions
are much smaller than the de Sitter curvature radius, to the leading order the
topological parts coincide with the corresponding quantities for a massless
fermionic field and are conformally related to the corresponding flat spacetime
results. In this limit the topological parts dominate the uncompactified de
Sitter part and the back-reaction effects should be taken into account. In the
opposite limit, for a massive field the asymptotic behavior of the topological
parts is damping oscillatory.

coupled planes. In such a situation, physical properties will display, upon
decreasing temperature or energy, a dimensional crossover from two-dimensional
(2d) to three-dimensional (3d) behavior, which is particularly interesting near
quantum criticality. Here we study this crossover in thermodynamics using a
suitably generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach to the critical behavior,
combined with renormalization group techniques. We focus on two experimentally
relevant cases: the crossover from a 2d to a 3d antiferromagnet, and the
crossover from a 2d ferromagnet to a 3d antiferromagnet. We discuss the
location of phase boundary and crossover lines and determine the crossover
functions for important thermodynamic quantities. As naive scaling does not
apply at and above the upper critical dimension, two crossover scales arise
which can be associated with separate dimensional crossovers of classical and
quantum fluctuations, respectively. In particular, we find an intermediate
regime with novel power laws where the quantum fluctuations still have a 2d and
the classical fluctuations already have a 3d character. For the
ferromagnet-to-antiferromagnet crossover, the mismatch of the dynamical
exponents between the 2d and 3d regimes leads to an even richer crossover
structure, with an interesting 2d non-critical regime sandwiched between two
critical regimes. For all cases, we find that thermal expansion and
compressibility are particularly sensitive probes of the dimensional crossover.
Finally, we relate our results to experiments on the quantum critical
heavy-fermion metals CeCu(6-x)Au(x), YbRh(2)Si(2) and CeCoIn(5).

Tauri stars based on high angular resolution optical spectra, using the Hubble
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS). The spectra refer to a region
within 100 AU of the star, i.e. where the collimation of the jet has just taken
place. We form PV images of the line ratios to get a global picture of the flow
excitation. We then apply a specialised diagnostic technique to find the
electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and total density.
Our results are in the form of PV maps of the obtained quantities, in which the
gas behaviour is resolved as a function of both radial velocity and distance
from the jet axis. They highlight a number of interesting physical features of
the jet collimation region, including regions of extremely high density,
asymmetries with respect to the axis, and possible shock signatures. Finally,
we estimate the jet mass and angular momentum outflow rates, both of which are
fundamental parameters in constraining models of accretion/ejection structures,
particularily if the parameters can be determined close to the jet footpoint.
Comparing mass flow rates for cases where the latter is available in the
literature (i.e. DG Tau, RW Aur and CW Tau) reveals a mass
ejection-to-accretion ratio of 0.01 - 0.07. Finally, where possible (i.e. DG
Tau and CW Tau), both mass and angular momentum outflow rates have been
resolved into higher and lower velocity jet material. For the clearer case of
DG Tau, this revealed that the more collimated higher velocity component plays
a dominant role in mass and angular momentum transport.

thin black ring. (In fact, our formalism is not theoretically dubious, since,
at it is not hard to see, it can correspond to an extreme simplification of a
more accurate, Copeland-Lahiri string formalism for the black hole
description.) Even if suggested formalism is, generally speaking,
phenomenological and rough, obtained final results, unexpectedly, are
non-trivial. Concretely, given formalism reproduces exactly Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon area and Hawking
temperature of a rotating, very thin black ring obtained earlier using more
accurate analysis by Reall, Emparan, Elvang, Virmani etc. (Conceptually it is
similar to situation in Bohr's atomic model where energy levels are determined
practically exactly even if electron motion is described roughly.) Our
formalism, according to suggestions in our previous works, is physically based
on the assumption that circumference of the horizon tube holds the natural
(integer) number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is
conceptually similar to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model
interpreted by de Broglie relation.) Also, we use, mathematically, practically
only simple algebraic equations (by determination of Hawking temperature we use
additionally only simple differentiation of Smarr relation).

scattered light, to the millimetre regime in thermal emission. Our data-set, in
conjunction with existing photometric data, provides an extensive coverage of
the spectral energy distribution, including a detailed spectrum of the silicate

have constructed a model that can reproduce all of the observations of the

observations in order to fully constrain the disc model, with each observation
providing a strong constraint only on some aspects of the disc structure and
dust content. Quantitative evidence of dust evolution in the disc is obtained:
grain growth up to millimetre-sized particles, vertical stratification of dust
grains with micrometric grains close to the disc surface and larger grains
which have settled towards the disc midplane, and possibly the formation of
fluffy aggregates and/or ice mantles around grains.

adsorbates, which are largely incompatible with any device technology. Here we
show by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that atomic doping of an
epitaxial graphene layer on a silicon carbide substrate with bismuth, antimony

combination with the intrinsic n-type character of epitaxial graphene on SiC,
the charge carriers can be tuned from electrons to holes, without affecting the

P_{11}(1710), P_{13}(1720), P_{33}(1232), P_{33}(1600), D_{13}(1520),
D_{13}(1700), and D_{33}(1700) are included explicitly in calculations. Our
model describes simultaneously the available data as well on total and
differential cross sections as on beam and target asymmetries. This holds for
the p(gamma,eta)p reaction for photon energies ranging from very close to
threshold to up to 3 GeV. The polarization observables show strong sensitivity
to resonances that otherwise contribute only weakly to the total cross section.
It is found that the pronounced bump-like structure seen in the excitation
function of the n(gamma,eta)n cross section at gamma energies around 1 GeV, can
be explained by the interference effects of S_{11}, P_{11} and P_{13} resonance
contributions.

  Theory Based Approach",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Horn theory based approach for cryptographic protocol analysis,
cryptographic protocols and (Dolev-Yao) intruders are modeled by Horn theories
and security analysis boils down to solving the derivation problem for Horn
theories. This approach and the tools based on this approach, including
ProVerif, have been very successful in the automatic analysis of cryptographic
protocols w.r.t. an unbounded number of sessions. However, dealing with the
algebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) has been
problematic. In particular, ProVerif cannot deal with XOR. In this paper, we
show how to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories with XOR to the
XOR-free case. Our reduction works for an expressive class of Horn theories. A
large class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator
can be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol
analysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very
efficient in the XOR-free case. We implemented our reduction and, in
combination with ProVerif, applied it in the automatic analysis of several
protocols that use the XOR operator. In one case, we found a new attack.

relativistic electrons. In radio quiet quasars (RQQs) the relative radio
emission is ~10^3 times weaker, and its origin is not established yet. We show
here that there is a strong correlation between the radio luminosity (L_R) and
X-ray luminosity (L_X) with L_R~10^-5L_X, for the radio quiet Palomar-Green
(PG) quasar sample. The sample is optically selected, with nearly complete
radio and X-ray detections, and thus this correlation cannot be due to direct
selection biases. The PG quasars lie on an extension of a similar correlation
noted by Panessa et al., for a small sample of nearby low luminosity type 1
AGN. A remarkably similar correlation, known as the Guedel-Benz relation, where
L_R/L_X~10^-5, holds for coronally active stars. The Guedel-Benz relation,
together with correlated stellar X-ray and radio variability, implies that the
coronae are magnetically heated. We therefore raise the possibility that AGN
coronae are also magnetically heated, and that the radio emission in RQQ also
originates in coronal activity. If correct, then RQQ should generally display
compact flat cores at a few GHz due to synchrotron self-absorption, while at a
few hundred GHz we should be able to see directly the X-ray emitting corona,
and relatively rapid and large amplitude variability, correlated with the X-ray
variability, is likely to be seen. We also discuss possible evidence that the
radio and X-ray emission in ultra luminous X-ray sources and Galactic black
holes may be of coronal origin as well.

re-estimate the luminosity of VY CMa to be (3 +/- 0.5) x 10^5 L_sun using the
bolometric flux integrated over optical and IR wavelengths. This improved

three examples: (i) electromagnetism in the future of a Cauchy surface in
Minkowski spacetime, (ii) electromagnetism in de Sitter spacetime, and (iii)
linearized gravity in de Sitter spacetime. In each example the field is
reproduced correctly as predicted by the general argument. In the third example
we construct a linearized gravitational field from two equal point masses
located at the ""North and South Poles"" which is non-singular on the
cosmological horizon and satisfies a covariant gauge condition and show that
this field is reproduced by the retarded Green's function with corresponding
gauge parameters.

and a substitutional proton. We performed HF and UHF calculations using the
STO-3G basis set. With increasing cluster size in the absence of impurities, we
find a decreasing energy gap, here defined as the HOMO-LUMO difference. In the
case of H chemisorption or a vacancy, the gap does not decrease appreciably,
whereas it is substantially reduced in the case of a substitutional proton. The
presence of an impurity invariably induces an increase of the density of states
near the HOMO level. We find a zero mode only in the case of a substitutional
proton. In agreement with experiments, we find that both the chemisorbed H, the
substitutional proton, and the C atom near a vacancy acquire a magnetic moment.

mortality in areas without medical death certification. Data on symptoms
reported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a
medical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the
population where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze
only one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to
satisfy, and require expensive, time-consuming, or unreliable physician
reviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing
current approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the
difficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These
generalizations also make physician review, expert algorithms and parametric
statistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical
analyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this
approach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more
computationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in
all circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less
expensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice
than existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate
proportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy
studies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary for, and thus
improve the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other
areas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that

to realizing lightweight large apertures for high angular resolution and high

corrected by a small diffractive achromatizer placed close to the focal plane

The primary array and the focal optics have been designed and assembled in our

carrying out hydrodynamical simulations with the help of the TRAMP code (Klahr

of discrete mass-loss and energy injection from stellar processes. This
naturally leads to a filamentary large scale torus component, where cold gas is
able to flow radially inwards. The filaments open out into a dense and very
turbulent disk structure. In a post-processing step, we calculate observable
quantities like spectral energy distributions or images with the help of the 3D
radiative transfer code MC3D (Wolf 2003). Good agreement is found in
comparisons with data due to the existence of almost dust-free lines of sight
through the large scale component and the large column densities caused by the

their dependence on the photon virtuality, which remains a challenge to current
theoretical models. A few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation are
suggested, along with possible experimental tests. The average time scale at
HERMES is found to be of the order of 4-5 fm, comparable to heavy nuclei radii,
so that by suitable kinematic cuts it will be possible to study both the case
in which hadronization starts inside and the case in which it starts outside
the nucleus. A comparison with recent CLAS preliminary data, which
qualitatively but not quantitatively agree with HERMES, is performed.

parameters of the vertically stratified medium in the horizontal direction and
in time, the evolution of the non-harmonic wave packages of the internal
gravity waves has been analyzed. The concrete form of the wave packages can be
expressed through some model functions and is defined by the local behavior of
the dispersive curves of the separate modes near to the corresponding special
points. The solution of this problem is possible with the help of the modified
variant of the special-time ray method offered by the authors (the method of
geometrical optics), the basic difference of which consists that the asymptotic
representation of the solution may be found in the form the series of the
non-integer degrees of some small parameter. At that the exponent depends on
the concrete form of representation of this package. The obvious kind of the
representation is determined from the principle of the localness and the
asymptotic behavior of the solution in the stationary and the
horizontally-homogeneous case. The phases of the wave packages are determined
from the corresponding equations of the eikonal, which can be solved
numerically on the characteristics (rays). Amplitudes of the wave packages are
determined from the laws of conservation of the some invariants along the
characteristics (rays).

is low enough, the surface of a strange star will be a crust consisting of a

to observationally rule out strange stars. We calculate the thickness of this

Debye screening of electric charge. Our calculation uses a generic

spherical strangelets, not rods or slabs of quark matter. We find that for a

from zero to hundreds of meters thick, the thickness being greater when the
strange quark is heavier, and the surface tension is smaller. For smaller quark
stars the crust will be even thicker.
