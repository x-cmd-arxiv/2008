strictly greater than the bent concatenation bound of 240, have been discovered

and Yucel. To improve this nonlinearity result, we have firstly defined some
subsets of the n-variable Boolean functions as the ""generalized classes of
k-RSBFs and k-DSBFs (k-Dihedral Symmetric Boolean Functions)"", where k is a
positive integer dividing n and k-RSBFs is a subset of l-RSBFs if k < l.
Secondly, utilizing the steepest-descent like iterative heuristic search
algorithm used previously to identify the 9-variable RSBFs with nonlinearity
241, we have made a search within the classes of 3-RSBFs and 3-DSBFs. The
search has accomplished to find 9-variable Boolean functions with nonlinearity
242 in both of these classes. It should be emphasized that although the class
of 3-RSBFs contains functions with nonlinearity 242; 1-RSBFs or simply RSBFs,
which is a subset of 3-RSBFs, does not contain any. This result also shows that
the covering radius of the first order Reed-Muller code R(1, 9) is at least
equal to 242. Thirdly, motivated by the fact that RSBFs are invariant under a
special permutation of the input vector, we have classified all possible
permutations up to the linear equivalence of Boolean functions that are
invariant under those permutations. Specifically, for 9-variable Boolean
functions, 9! possible permutations are classified into 30 classes; and the
search algorithm identifies some of these classes as ""rich"". The rich classes
yield new Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 having different
autocorrelation spectra from those of the functions found in the generalized
3-RSBF and 3-DSBF classes.

how well the individual modes can be uniquely identified from time series of
images. A simple, purely geometrical model is constructed to describe the
different types of kink-mode oscillations. These are then `observed' from a
given direction. In particular, we employ the 3D geometrical parameters of 14
TRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed
wave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it
is not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes
just using time series of images. We also considered Doppler signatures and
find that these can help obtain unique identifications of the oscillation modes
when employed in combination with imaging. We then compare the modeled spatial
signatures with the observations of 14 TRACE loops. We find that out of three
oscillations previously identified as fundamental horizontal mode oscillations,
two cases appear to be fundamental vertical mode oscillations (but possibly
combined with the fundamental horizontal mode), and one case appears to be a
combination of the fundamental vertical and horizontal modes, while in three
cases it is not possible to clearly distinguish between the fundamental mode
and the second-harmonic of the horizontal oscillation. In five other cases it
is not possible to clearly distinguish between a fundamental horizontal mode

leading order in $\alpha_s$. We obtain $m_{D^*D^*}=(4.15\pm0.12) \GeV$, around
100 MeV above the $D^*D^*$ threshold, and $m_{D_1D}=(4.19\pm 0.22) \GeV$,
around 100 MeV below the $D_1D$ threshold. We conclude that the
$D^{*+}\bar{D}^{*0}$ state is probably a virtual state that is not related with
the $Z_1^+(4050)$ resonance-like structure. In the case of the $D_1D$ molecular
state, considering the errors, its mass is consistent with both $Z_1^+(4050)$
and $Z_2^+(4250)$ resonance-like structures. Therefore, we conclude that no
definite conclusion can be drawn for this state from the present analysis.

can take trans-Planckian values while driving a period of slow-roll inflation.
This leads naturally to a realisation of large field inflation, inasmuch as the
inflationary epoch is well described by the single-field scalar potential $V =
V_0 (3-4 e^{-\hat\varphi/\sqrt{3}})$. Remarkably, for a broad class of vacua
all adjustable parameters enter only through the overall coefficient $V_0$, and
in particular do not enter into the slow-roll parameters. Consequently these
are determined purely by the number of \e-foldings, $N_e$, and so are not
independent: $\varepsilon \simeq \frac32 \eta^2$. This implies similar
relations among observables like the primordial scalar-to-tensor amplitude,
$r$, and the scalar spectral tilt, $n_s$: $r \simeq 6(n_s - 1)^2$. $N_e$ is
itself more model-dependent since it depends partly on the post-inflationary
reheat history. In a simple reheating scenario a reheating temperature of
$T_{rh}\simeq 10^{9}$ GeV gives $N_e\simeq 58$, corresponding to $n_s\simeq
0.970$ and $r\simeq 0.005$, within reach of future observations. The model is
an example of a class that arises naturally in the context of type IIB string
compactifications with large-volume moduli stabilisation, and takes advantage
of the generic existence there of Kahler moduli whose dominant appearance in
the scalar potential arises from string loop corrections to the Kahler
potential. The inflaton field is a combination of Kahler moduli of a K3-fibered
Calabi-Yau manifold. We believe there are likely to be a great number of models
in this class -- `high-fibre models' -- in which the inflaton starts off far
enough up the fibre to produce observably large primordial gravity waves.

previous analyses of Cas A's X-ray emission, we present a model for the
evolution of Cas A and find that it's expansion is well fit by a rho_ej ~
r^{-(7-9)} ejecta profile running into a circumstellar wind. We further find
that while the position of the reverse shock in this model is consistent with
that measured in the X-rays, in order to match the forward shock velocity and
radius we had to assume that ~ 30% of the explosion energy has gone into
accelerating cosmic rays at the forward shock. The new X-ray images also show
that brightness variations can occur for some forward shock filaments like that
seen for several nonthermal filaments seen projected in the interior of the
remnant. Spectral fits to exterior forward shock filaments and interior
nonthermal filaments show that they exhibit similar spectra. This together with
similar flux variations suggests that interior nonthermal filaments might be
simply forward shock filaments seen in projection and not located at the
reverse shock as has been recently proposed.

we formulate the coupling of quantum matter fields to a dynamical gravitational
background in an effective framework which allows the inclusion of

inhomogeneities and can thus manage to generate cosmic structure in an evolving
background. Several specific effects follow from a qualitative analysis of the

data is confined to WIMP masses close to $m_\chi \simeq 12$ GeV, in
disagreement with the constraints from CDMS and XENON. We conclude that even if
channeling is taken into account this interpretation of the DAMA modulation
signal is disfavoured. There are no overlap regions in the parameter space at
90% CL and a consistency test gives the probability of $1.2\times 10^{-5}$. We
study the robustness of this result with respect to variations of the WIMP
velocity distribution in our galaxy, by changing various parameters of the

values for A_CP(b->s gamma) and ii) a lower bound for the electron and neutron
EDMs at the level of d_e,n > 10^-28 e cm. Moreover, we predict positive New

lead to an explanation for the anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.

find that while the first type of avalanches has a simple scaling behavior, the
second (complex) type is characterized by an avalanche-size dependent scaling
exponent. This provides a framework within which one can understand the failure
of a consistent scaling behavior in this model.

a particle-in-cell (PIC) code, and in which binary collision processes and
single-particle processes are modeled through a Monte-Carlo approach. Our novel
simulation tool -- the PhotonPlasma code -- is a unique hybrid model; it
combines a highly parallelized (Vlasov) particle-in-cell approach with
continuous weighting of particles and a sub-Debye Monte-Carlo binary particle
interaction framework.
  As an illustration of the capabilities we present results from a numerical
study of Gamma-Ray Burst - Circumburst Medium interaction and plasma
preconditioning via Compton scattering. We argue that important microphysical
processes can only viably be investigated by means of hybrid codes such as the
PhotonPlasma code.
  Our first results from 3D simulations with this new simulation tool suggest
that magnetic fields and plasma filaments are created in the wakefield of
prompt gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the photon flux density gradient impacts
on particle acceleration in the burst head and wakefield. We discuss some
possible implications of the circumburst medium being preconditioned for a
trailing afterglow shock front. We also discuss important improvements for
future studies of GRB wakefields processes, using the PhotonPlasma code.

Lasso, in which block regularization based on the $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm is used
for support union recovery, or recovery of the set of $s$ rows for which $B^*$

complexity parameter $\theta(n,p,s):=n/[2\psi(B^*)\log(p-s)]$. Here $n$ is the
sample size, and $\psi(B^*)$ is a sparsity-overlap function measuring a
combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the $K$-regression coefficient
vectors that constitute the model. We prove that the multivariate group Lasso
succeeds for problem sequences $(n,p,s)$ such that $\theta(n,p,s)$ exceeds a
critical level $\theta_u$, and fails for sequences such that $\theta(n,p,s)$
lies below a critical level $\theta_{\ell}$. For the special case of the
standard Gaussian ensemble, we show that $\theta_{\ell}=\theta_u$ so that the
characterization is sharp. The sparsity-overlap function $\psi(B^*)$ reveals
that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, $\ell_1/\ell_2$
regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to
an ordinary Lasso approach and can yield substantial improvements in sample
complexity (up to a factor of $K$) when the coefficient vectors are suitably
orthogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to
outperform the multivariate group Lasso. We complement our analysis with

Further, such vectors are shown to produce an unpinned helical order
characterized by a particular ordering wavevector magnitude but unpinned
direction, dubbed partial order, at physically realizable temperatures. A
consequence of such an unpinned helical ordering is that the neutron scattering
intensity is sharply peaked at this wavevector magnitude. The surface formed by
connecting these wavevectors is a sphere, around which the neutron scattering
weight is spread. We further show that the observed neutron scattering
intensity can be anisotropic along this surface and that this anisotropy is
dependent on the experimentalist's choice of lattice Bragg peak through a
geometric factor. A neutron scattering measurement near the Bragg point
($\frac{2\pi}{a}$,$\frac{2\pi}{a}$,0) naturally leads to a highest intensity
along the (1,1,0) direction consistent with the observed anisotropy in MnSi

arbitrarily oriented spins of magnitude S_1/m_1^2~0.6 and S_2/m_2^2~0.4 and
orbits 9 times prior to merger. The numerical simulation starts with an initial
separation of r~11M, with orbital parameters determined by initial 2.5PN and
3.5PN post-Newtonian evolutions of a quasi-circular binary with an initial
separation of r=50M. The resulting binaries have very little eccentricity
according to the 2.5PN and 3.5PN systems, but show significant eccentricities
of e~0.01-0.02 and e~0.002-0.005 in the respective numerical simulations, thus
demonstrating that 3.5PN significantly reduces the eccentricity of the binary
compared to 2.5PN. We perform three numerical evolutions from r~11M with
maximum resolutions of h=M/48,M/53.3,M/59.3, to verify numerical convergence.
We observe a reasonably good agreement between the PN and numerical waveforms,
with an overlap of nearly 99% for the first six cycles of the (l=2,m=+-2)
modes, 91% for the (l=2,m=+-1) modes, and nearly 91% for the (l=3,m=+-3) modes.
The phase differences between numerical and post-Newtonian approximations
appear to be independent of the (l,m) modes considered and relatively small for
the first 3-4 orbits. An advantage of the 3.5 PN model over the 2.5 PN one
seems to be observed, which indicates that still higher PN order (perhaps even
4.0PN) may yield significantly better waveforms. In addition, we identify

star-forming clumps. Models suggest the clumps form by gravitational
instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they
interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge.
Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are
all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical
bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high
alpha-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four
high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have
an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk, three of the models have a
pre-existing bulge and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the
same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps
are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of
massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms
of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter
component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback
has little effect because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly
bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including
clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively
little dark matter.

within the cell cycle. It occurs for a variety of models and for a broad
selection of parameter values. These results suggest that the clustering
phenomenon is robust and is likely to be observed in nature. Since there are
necessarily an integer number of clusters, clustering would lead to
periodic-like behavior with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the

  calculation of band-gaps of semiconductors","Zip file containing .tex and 6 .ps figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.78.125116",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The local-density approximation (LDA), together with the half-occupation
(transition state) is notoriously successful in the calculation of atomic
ionization potentials. When it comes to extended systems, such as a
semiconductor infinite system, it has been very difficult to find a way to
half-ionize because the hole tends to be infinitely extended (a Bloch wave).
The answer to this problem lies in the LDA formalism itself. One proves that
the half-occupation is equivalent to introducing the hole self-energy
(electrostatic and exchange-correlation) into the Schroedinger equation. The
argument then becomes simple: the eigenvalue minus the self-energy has to be
minimized because the atom has a minimal energy. Then one simply proves that
the hole is localized, not infinitely extended, because it must have maximal
self-energy. Then one also arrives at an equation similar to the SIC equation,
but corrected for the removal of just 1/2 electron. Applied to the calculation
of band gaps and effective masses, we use the self-energy calculated in atoms
and attain a precision similar to that of GW, but with the great advantage that
it requires no more computational effort than standard LDA.

A working mansucript",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses the intrinsic relationship between trees and networks
(i.e. graphs). A complete (invertible) mapping is presented which allows trees
to be mapped into weighted graphs and then backmapped into the original tree
without loss of information. The extension of this methodology to more general
networks, including unweighted structures, is also discussed and illustrated.
It is shown that the identified duality between trees and graphs underlies
several key concepts and issues of current interest in complex networks,
including comprehensive characterization of trees and community detection. For
instance, additional information about tree structures (e.g. phylogenetic
trees) can be immediately obtained by taking into account several off-the-shelf
network measurements -- such as the clustering coefficient, degree correlations
and betweenness centrality. At the same time, the hierarchical structure of
networks, including the respective communities, becomes clear when the network
is represented in terms of the respective tree. Indeed, the network-tree
mapping described in this work provides a simple and yet effective means of
community detection.

  FAST 2008",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This
makes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations,
into an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric
studies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse
selection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were
found among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those
without. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust
authorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics
suggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if
trust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of
trust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to
power-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust.
The evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are
known to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive
attacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust
building, and suggest some ideas for exploration.

The asymmetry of shearing in the slip direction <111> in the positive and
negative sense, respectively, commonly identified with the
twinning-antitwinning asymmetry, is undoubtedly one of the reasons. However,
effect of stress components other than the shear stress in the slip direction
may be important. In this paper we investigate by atomistic modeling the effect
of shear stresses perpendicular to the Burgers vector on the glide of a/2<111>
screw dislocations. We show that these shear stresses can significantly elevate
or reduce the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) in the direction of the
Burgers vector needed for the dislocation motion, i.e. the Peierls stress. This
occurs owing to the changes of the core induced by these stresses. This effect
may be the reason why slip systems with smaller Schmid factors may be preferred
over that with the largest Schmid factor.

`B', `Cr', `Cp' and `D') as well as the extended star cluster, EC4, which lies
within streamC, all discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey.
These spectroscopic results were initially serendipitous, making use of our
existing observations from the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted
on the Keck II telescope, and thereby emphasizing the ubiquity of tidal streams
that account for ~70% of the M31 halo stars in the targeted fields. Subsequent
spectroscopy was then procured in streamCr/p and streamD to trace the velocity
gradient along the streams. For the cluster EC4, candidate member stars with
average [Fe/H]~-1.4 (Fe/H_spec=-1.6), are found at v_{hel}=-285 km/s suggesting
it could be related to streamCp. No similarly obvious cold kinematic candidate
is found for streamD, although candidates are proposed in both of two
spectroscopic pointings along the stream (both at -400 km/s). Spectroscopy near
the edge of streamB suggests a likely kinematic detection, while a candidate
kinematic detection of streamA is found (plausibly associated to M33 rather
than M31). The low dispersion of the streams in kinematics, physical thickness,
and metallicity makes it hard to reconcile with a scenario whereby these stream
structures as an ensemble are related to the giant southern stream. We conclude
that the M31 stellar halo is largely made up of multiple kinematically cold
streams.

nuclei (AGN) relics with the measured mass function of the massive black holes
in galaxies provides strong evidence for the growth of massive black holes
being dominated by mass accretion. We derive the Eddington ratio distributions
as functions of black hole mass and redshift from a large AGN sample with
measured Eddington ratios given by Kollmeier et al. We find that, even at the
low mass end, most black holes are accreting at Eddington ratio ~0.2, which
implies that the objects accreting at extremely high rates should be rare or
such phases are very short. Using the derived Eddington ratios, we explore the
cosmological evolution of massive black holes with an AGN bolometric luminosity
function (LF). It is found that the resulted BHMF of AGN relics is unable to
match the measured local BHMF of galaxies for any value of (constant) radiative
efficiency. Motivated by Volonteri, Sikora & Lasota's study on the spin
evolution of massive black holes, we assume the radiative efficiency to be
dependent of black hole mass, i.e., it is low for M<10^8 solar masses and it
increases with black hole mass for black holes with >10^8 solar masses. We find
that the BHMF of AGN relics can roughly reproduce the local BHMF of galaxies if
the radiative efficiency ~0.08 for the black holes with <10^8 solar masses and
it increases to ~0.18 for black holes with >10^9 solar masses, which implies
that most massive black holes (>10^9 solar masses) are spinning very rapidly.

  We also present a mechanism of resummation of the logarithmic singularities
of the $\chi^{(n)}$ leading to the known power-law critical behaviour occurring

effect of the Coulomb interaction have been also studied. The effect of the

the matter with neutrino trapping. Although almost independent to the variation
of the leptonic fraction, the instability region of matter with neutrino
trapping is found to be larger. The presence of more protons and electrons

parameter sets with soft equation of states at low density, the appearance of a
large and negative epsilon_L (q, q0 = 0) in some parts of the edge of the

consequence of the fact that the Coulomb interaction produced by electrons and

individual time-steps in the way described in the literature, cannot handle
strong explosion problems correctly. In the individual time-step scheme,
particles determine their time-steps essentially from a local Courant
condition. Thus they cannot respond to a strong shock, if the pre-shock
timescale is too long compared to the shock timescale. This problem is not
severe in SPH simulations of galaxy formation with a temperature cutoff in the
cooling function at $10^4 {\rm K}$, while it is very dangerous for simulations
in which the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium under $10^4 {\rm K}$
is taken into account. A solution for this problem is to introduce a time-step
limiter which reduces the time-step of a particle if it is too long compared to
the time-steps of its neighbor particles. Thus this kind of time-step
constraint is essential for the correct treatment of explosions in
high-resolution SPH simulations with individual time-steps.

the CLAIRE lens prototype. Since then, the endeavour has been oriented towards

Gamma-Ray Imager (GRI) which intends to make use of the Laue lens to cover
energies from 200 keV to 1300 keV.
  Investigations of two promising materials, low mosaicity copper and gradient

have been performed during three runs on beamline ID15A of the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, and on the GAMS 4 instrument of the Institute
Laue-Langevin (both in Grenoble, France) using highly monochromatic beam of
energy close to 500 keV. Despite it was not perfectly homogeneous, the
presented copper crystal exhibits peak reflectivity of 25% in accordance with
theoretical predictions, and a mosaicity around 26 arcsec, the ideal range for
the realization of a Laue lens such as GRI. Silicon-germanium featuring a
constant gradient have been measured for the very first time at 500 keV. Two
samples showed a quite homogeneous reflectivity reaching 26%, which is far from
the 48% already observed in experimental crystals but a very encouraging
beginning. This results have been used to estimate the performance of the GRI

Swiss countryside. He obtained a diploma in mathematics in 1958 and a Ph.D. in
mathematics in 1961, both from ETH Zurich. His thesis was in pure mathematics,
but he then decided to go into statistics. He spent 1961--1963 as a postdoc at
the statistics department in Berkeley where he wrote his first and most famous
paper on robust statistics, ``Robust Estimation of a Location Parameter.''
After a position as a visiting professor at Cornell University, he became a
full professor at ETH Zurich. He worked at ETH until 1978, interspersed by
visiting positions at Cornell, Yale, Princeton and Harvard. After leaving ETH,
he held professor positions at Harvard University 1978--1988, at MIT
1988--1992, and finally at the University of Bayreuth from 1992 until his
retirement in 1999. He now lives in Klosters, a village in the Grisons in the
Swiss Alps. Peter Huber has published four books and over 70 papers on
statistics and data analysis. In addition, he has written more than a dozen
papers and two books on Babylonian mathematics, astronomy and history. In 1972,
he delivered the Wald lectures. He is a fellow of the IMS, of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. In 1988 he received a Humboldt Award and in 1994 an honorary
doctorate from the University of Neuch\^{a}tel. In addition to his fundamental
results in robust statistics, Peter Huber made important contributions to
computational statistics, strategies in data analysis, and applications of
statistics in fields such as crystallography, EEGs, and human growth curves.

spin bias. Electron transport through a double quantum dot is investigated
theoretically when a pure spin bias is applied on two conducting leads
contacted to the quantum dot. It is found that the spin polarization in the
left and right dots may be induced spontaneously while the intra-dot levels are
located within the spin bias window and breaks the left-right symmetry of the
two quantum dots. As a result, a large current emerges. For an open external
circuit an charge bias instead of a charge current will be induced in
equilibrium, which is believed to be measurable according to the current
nanotechnology. This method may provide a practical and whole electrical
approach to detect the spin bias (or the spin current) by measuring the charge
bias or current in a double quantum dot.

technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive

neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the
low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by
LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the
low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly
sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear

overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using
a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this
straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's

regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the

features of the BRS cohomology for composite operators in the SSM, and the
behaviour of those operators when gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. A new
realization of supersymmetry arises for these operators. This realization is
equivalent to the generation of supersymmetry anomalies, though they are not
present in the usual sense. The consequences are worked out in detail for the
electron and neutrino flavour triplets, by using the appropriate effective
action to analyze the new anomalous realization of supersymmetry. This
effective action generates a mass spectrum for leptons that is consistent with
present experimental data. There is no vacuum energy problem, and no annoying

heliosphere their phase-space distribution nevertheless is a theoretically
unsettled problem. Especially the question of how pick-up ions form their
suprathermal tails, extending to far above their injection energies, still now
is unsatistactorily answered. Though Fermi-2 velocity diffusion theories have
revealed that such tails are populated, they nevertheless show that resulting
population densities are much less than seen in observations showing power-laws
with a velocity index of ""-5"". We first investigate here, whether or not
observationally suggested power-laws can be the result of a quasi-equilibrium
state between suprathermal ions and magnetohydrodynamic turbulences in energy
exchange with eachother. We demonstrate that such an equilibrium cannot be
established, since it would require too high pick-up ion pressures enforcing a
shock-free deceleration of the solar wind. We furthermore show that Fermi-2
type energy diffusion in the outer heliosphere is too inefficient to determine
the shape of the distribution function there. As we can show, however,
power-laws beyond the injection threshold can be established, if the injection
takes place at higher energies of the order of 100 keV. As we demonstrate here,
such an injection is connected with modulated anomalous cosmic ray (ACR)
particles at the lower end of their spectrum when they again start being
convected outwards with the solar wind. Therefore, we refer to these particles
as ACR-PUIs. In our quantitative calculation of the pick-up ion spectrum
resulting under such conditions we in fact find again power-laws, however with
a velocity power index of ""-4"" and fairly distance-independent spectral
intensities.

which is singular in the standard supergravity description but regular after

resolve mixing in space and time. We apply our prescription to the evolution of
an idealized supernova remnant and find that we can model the distribution of
heavy elements without having to explicitly resolve hydrodynamic instabilities
in the post-shock gas. Instead, the dispersal of the pollutant is implicitly
modelled through its dependence on the local velocity dispersion. Our method
can thus be used in any SPH simulation that investigates chemical mixing but
lacks the necessary resolution on small scales. Potential applications include
the enrichment of the interstellar medium in present-day galaxies, as well as
the intergalactic medium at high redshifts.

$TS^2$, viewed as the space of oriented geodesics in ${\mathbb E}^3$. Here
complex and Lagrangian refer to the canonical neutral Kaehler structure on
$TS^2$. We then prove that the existence of a closed convex surface with only
one umbilic point implies the existence of a totally real Lagrangian hemisphere
in $TS^2$, to which it is not possible to attach the edge of a holomorphic
disc. The main step in the proof is to establish the existence of a holomorphic
disc with edge contained on any given totally real Lagrangian hemisphere. To
construct the holomorphic disc we utilize mean curvature flow with respect to
the neutral metric. Long-time existence of this flow is proven by a priori
estimates and we show that the flowing disc is asymptotically holomorphic.
Existence of a holomorphic disc is then deduced from Schauder estimates.

J0132-0952, shows evidence of ionized intrinsic absorption. The most-luminous
SDSS double-peaked emitter, SDSS J2125-0813, has either an unusual flat
spectrum (~1) or is also highly absorbed. It is the only double-peaked emitter
for which no external illumination is necessary to account for the Balmer line
emission. The strength of the Balmer-line emission in the remaining four
objects suggests that the total line flux likely exceeds the viscous energy
that can be extracted locally from the accretion disk and external illumination
is necessary. All five double-peaked emitters have unusually strong X-ray
emission relative to their UV/optical emission, which is the likely source of
the external illumination necessary for the production of the observed strong
broad lines. On average about 30% of their bolometric luminosities are emitted
between 0.5-10keV. The spectral energy distributions of the five double-peaked
emitters show the big blue bumps characteristic of radiatively efficient
accretion flows. The Balmer line profiles, as well as the optical and X-ray
