asteroids (NEAs) is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of main
belt asteroids (MBAs) with sizes (diameters) between 200 and 1,000 km. This
confirms the idea that large MBAs, over hundreds millions of years,have
developed a fine and thick thermally insulating regolith layer, responsible for
the low values of their thermal inertia, whereas km-sized asteroids, having
collisional lifetimes of only some millions years, have less regolith, and
consequently a larger surface thermal inertia. Because it is believed that
regolith on asteroids forms as a result of impact processes, a better knowledge
of asteroid thermal inertia values and its correlation with size, taxonomic
type, and density can be used as an important constraintfor modeling of impact
processes on asteroids. However, our knowledge of asteroids' thermal inertia
values is still based on few data points with NEAs covering the size range
0.1-20 km and MBAs that >100 km. Here, we use IRAS infrared measurements to
estimate the thermal inertias of MBAs with diameters 100 km and known shapes
and spin vector: filling an important size gap between the largest MBAs and the
km-sized NEAs. An update to the inverse correlation between thermal inertia and
diameter is presented. For some asteroids thermophysical modelling allowed us
to discriminate between the two still possible spin vector solutions derived
from optical lightcurve inversion. This is important for (720) Bohlinia: our
preferred solution was predicted to be the correct one by Vokrouhlicky et al.

transmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference, the conditional
output entropy at the receiver is invariant with respect to the transmitted
codewords. We compare the new capacity region upper bound with the
Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region for interference channels. This comparison
shows that our bound is tight in some cases, thereby yielding specific points
on the capacity region as well as sum capacity for certain Z-interference
channels. In particular, this result can be used as an alternate method to
obtain sum capacity of Gaussian Z-interference channels. We then apply an
additional restriction on our channel class: the transmitter-receiver pair that
suffers from interference achieves its maximum output entropy with a single
input distribution irrespective of the interference distribution. For these
channels we show that our new capacity region upper bound coincides with the
Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region, which is therefore capacity-achieving. In
particular, for these channels superposition encoding with partial decoding is
shown to be optimal and a single-letter characterization for the capacity

neutralino dark matter, as well as light dark matter, influences the rate of
heating, ionisation and Lyman-alpha pumping of interstellar hydrogen and helium

halos and substructures within them. We find that the influence of such
structures can result in significant changes in the differential brightness
temperature. The changes at redsfhits z<25 are likely to be undetectable due to
the presence of the astrophysical signal; however, in the most favourable

value in the absence of self-annihilating DM, of up to ~20 mK at z=30 can

measuring the global 21cm signal, such as EDGES and CORE, will need to reduce
the systematics at 50 MHz to below 20 mK.

contributions from a young (200 Myr) and intermediate (1 Gyr) components are

abundance relatively homogeneous across the disk. The absence of an abundance
gradient in the secondary galaxy is interpreted in terms of mixing by gas flows

greenhouse effect. This explanation is in contradiction with the thermodynamics
second law. The warming up by greenhouse effect is quite improbable. It is
cloud reflection that gives to the earth s ground its 15 degres C mean
temperature. Since the reflection of the radiation by gases is negligible, the
role of the atmosphere greenhouse gases in the earth warming up by earth
radiation reflection loses its importance. We think that natural climatic
oscillations contribute more to earth climatic disturbances. The oscillation
that we hypothesize to exist has a long period (800 to 1000 years). The glacier
melting and regeneration cycles lead to variations in the cold region ocean
water density and thermal conductibility according to their salinity. These
variations lead one to think about a macro climate oscillating between maximum
hot and minimum cold temperatures. This oscillation is materialized by the
passages of the planet through hot, mild, and cold eras, leading to the great
season climatic oscillation phenomenon (GSCO). Thus, our planet lives four
great seasons a great spring, a great summer, a great winter and a great
autumn/fall, making a great year embracing our four small classical yearly
seasons. The probabilistic character of the parameters that are at the origin
of this climatic oscillation makes the long-term prediction less precise but
the deterministic tendencies and the resonance phenomena give precious
information on our planet climatic future. The present warming up is well
interpreted in the frame of the great season climatic oscillation theory.

wide diversity among the velocity fields: in a few galaxies the gas is clearly
in disk-like rotation, while in other galaxies the gas kinematics appear
chaotic or are dominated by radial flows with multiple velocity components. The
[S II] line ratio indicates a radial stratification in gas density, with a
sharp increase within the inner 10-20 pc, in the majority of the Type 1
objects. We examine how the [N II] 6583 line width varies as a function of
aperture size over a range of spatial scales, extending from scales comparable
to the black hole's sphere of influence to scales dominated by the host
galaxy's bulge. For most galaxies in the sample, we find that the emission-line
velocity dispersion is largest within the black hole's gravitational sphere of
influence, and decreases with increasing aperture size toward values similar to
the bulge stellar velocity dispersion measured within ground-based apertures.

are greater than with our earlier, simplified ionization model. At the lower

enhancement from current ozone depletion ~3% is a documented stress on the

the origin of the magnetic seed fields are galactic outflows during the

model for magnetized galactic winds as suggested by \citet{2006MNRAS.370..319B}
to our cosmological simulation. We find that the strength and structure of
magnetic fields observed in galaxy clusters are well reproduced for a wide
range of model parameters for the magnetized, galactic winds and do only weakly
depend on the exact magnetic structure within the assumed galactic outflows.
Although the evolution of a primordial magnetic seed field shows no significant
differences to that of galaxy clusters fields from previous studies, we find
that the magnetic field pollution in the diffuse medium within filaments is
below the level predicted by scenarios with pure primordial magnetic seed
field. We therefore conclude that magnetized galactic outflows and their
subsequent evolution within the intra-cluster medium can fully account for the
observed magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Our findings also suggest that
measuring cosmological magnetic fields in low-density environments such as
filaments is much more useful than observing cluster magnetic fields to infer
their possible origin.

communication service, such algorithms enable the transformation of programs
written in abstract models considered in distributed computing literature into
a model consistent with sensor networks, i.e., write all with collision (WAC)
model. Existing TDMA slot assignment algorithms have one or more of the
following properties: (i) compute slots using a randomized algorithm, (ii)
assume that the topology is known upfront, and/or (iii) assign slots
sequentially. If these algorithms are used to transform abstract programs into
programs in WAC model then the transformed programs are probabilistically
correct, do not allow the addition of new nodes, and/or converge in a
sequential fashion. In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing deterministic
TDMA algorithm where a sensor is aware of only its neighbors. We show that the
slots are assigned to the sensors in a concurrent fashion and starting from
arbitrary initial states, the algorithm converges to states where
collision-free communication among the sensors is restored. Moreover, this
algorithm facilitates the transformation of abstract programs into programs in
WAC model that are deterministically correct.

23.10 +/- 0.01, and is strongly-lensed by the foreground massive galaxy cluster
Abell 1689 (z=0.18). Stellar continuum is seen longward of the Ly-alpha
emission line at ~7100 \AA, while intergalactic H I produces strong absorption
shortward of Ly-alpha. Two transmission spikes at ~6800 Angstroms (A) and ~7040
A are also visible, along with other structures at shorter wavelengths.
Although fainter than a QSO, the absence of a strong central ultraviolet flux
source in this star forming galaxy enables a measurement of the H I flux
transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the vicinity of a high
redshift object. We find that the effective H I optical depth of the IGM is
remarkably high within a large 14 Mpc (physical) region surrounding the galaxy
compared to that seen towards QSOs at similar redshifts. Evidently, this
high-redshift galaxy is located in a region of space where the amount of H I is
much larger than that seen at similar epochs in the diffuse IGM. We argue that
observations of high-redshift galaxies like this one provide unique insights on
the nascent stages of baryonic large-scale structures that evolve into the
filamentary cosmic web of galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed in the
present universe.

galaxies and in a few luminous spiral galaxies, but little is known about
globular clusters in low-luminosity spirals.
  AIMS: Past observations with the ACS have shown that NGC 45 hosts a large
population of globular clusters (19), as well as several young star clusters.
In this work we aim to confirm the bona fide globular cluster status for 8 of
19 globular cluster candidates and to derive metallicities, ages, and
velocities.
  METHODS: VLT/FORS2 multislit spectroscopy in combination with the Lick/IDS
system was used to derive velocities and to constrain metallicities and
[alpha/Fe] element ratio of the globular clusters.
  RESULTS: We confirm the 8 globular clusters as bona fide globular clusters.
Their velocities indicate halo or bulge-like kinematics, with little or no
overall rotation. From absorption indices such as H_beta, H_gamma, and H_delta
and the combined [MgFe]' index, we found that the globular clusters are
metal-poor [Z/H]<=-0.33 dex and [alpha/Fe]<=0.0 element ratio. These results
argue in favor of a population of globular clusters formed during the
assembling of the galaxy.

epoch of reionization(EoR). In the next few years, the SKA pathfinders will
provide statistical measurements of this signal. Numerical simulations
predicting these observations are necessary to optimize the design of the
instruments. The main difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of
neutral hydrogen which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and on the level
of the local Lyman-alpha flux. A T_s >> T_cmb assumption is usual. However,
this assumption does not apply early in the reionization history, or even later
in the history as long as the sources of X-rays are too weak to heat the
intergalactic medium significantly. This work presents the first EoR numerical
simulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum radiative
transfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-alpha radiative transfer. This
allows us to compute the spin temperature more accurately. We use two different
box sizes, 20 Mpc/h and 100 Mpc/h, and a star source model. Using the redshift
dependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify the
effect of using different assumptions to compute the spin temperature and the
influence of the box size. The first effect comes from allowing for a signal in
absorption. The magnitude of this effect depends on the amount of heating by
hydrodynamic shocks and X-rays in the intergalactic medium(IGM). The second
effects comes from using the real, local, Lyman-alpha flux. This effect is
important for an average ionization fraction of less than 10%: it changes the
overall amplitude of the 21 cm signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the
power spectrum.

bearing on cosmology, because local processes are responsible for the formation
of HD. Based on correlations with E(B-V), H2, CO, and iron depletion, we find
that HD is formed in the densest portion of the clouds; the slope of the
logN(HD)/log(H2) correlation is greater than 1.0, caused by the destruction
rate of HD declining more slowly than that of H2; and, as a sidelight, that the
depletions are density dependent.

using MARX, a program that simulates the on-orbit performance of the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. We analyze these simulated data to generate radial profiles
of the surface brightness and temperature. At later times, $t = 2.0-3.0$ Gyr
after the collision, the simulated surface brightness profiles are better fit
by a superposition of two $\beta$-model profiles than a single profile, in
agreement with the observations of Cl~0024+17. In general, due to projection
effects, much of the post-collision density and temperature structure of the
clusters is not seen in the observations. In particular, the observed
temperatures from spectral fitting are much lower than the temperature of the
hottest gas. We determine from our fitted profiles that if the system is
modeled as a single cluster, the hydrostatic mass estimate is a factor
$\sim$2-3 less than the actual mass, but if the system is modeled as two galaxy
clusters in superposition, a hydrostatic mass estimation can be made which is
accurate to within $\sim$10%. We examine some implications of these results for

expectations that the disk component is more elongated than the donor and is

provides a source of dissipation, and also provides a source of inelastic
scattering that allows a nonequilibrium steady state to reach. A nonequilibrium
Keldysh action for the superconducting fluctuations on the normal side is
derived. Current flow, besides its minimal coupling to the order parameter is
found to give rise to two new effects. One is a source of noise that acts as an
effective temperature $T_{eff} = e E v_F \tau_{sc}$ where $E$ is the external
electric field, $v_F$ the Fermi velocity, and $\tau_{sc}$ is the escape time
into the normal metal substrate. Secondly current flow also produces a drift of
the order-parameter. Scaling equations for the superconducting gap and the
current are derived and are found to be consistent with previous
phenomenological treatments as long as a temperature $T \sim T_{eff}$ is
included. The current induced drift is found to produce additional corrections
to the scaling which are smaller by a factor of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{E_F
\tau_{sc}})$, $E_F$ being the Fermi energy.

half the transport mean free path tau0/lambda0 > ~2. The same accuracy with
Navier-Stokes requires three times larger tau0/lambda0 > ~6. For dynamics
driven by a constant cross section, on the other hand, about 50% larger

equation, even with reasonable matter sources. These solutions appear to
violate causality and so are considered problematic. Since CTCs reflect the
global properties of a spacetime, one can attempt to change its topology,
without changing its geometry, in such a way that the former CTCs are no longer
closed in the new spacetime. This procedure is informally known as unwrapping.
However, changes in global identifications tend to lead to local effects, and
unwrapping is no exception, as it introduces a special kind of singularity,
called quasi-regular. This ""unwrapping"" singularity is similar to the string
singularities. We give two examples of unwrapping of essentially 2+1
dimensional spacetimes with CTCs, the Gott spacetime and the Godel universe. We
show that the unwrapped Gott spacetime, while singular, is at least devoid of
CTCs. In contrast, the unwrapped Godel spacetime still contains CTCs through
every point. A ""multiple unwrapping"" procedure is devised to remove the
remaining circular CTCs. We conclude that, based on the two spacetimes we
investigated, CTCs appearing in the solutions of the Einstein equation are not
simply a mathematical artifact of coordinate identifications, but are indeed a
necessary consequence of General Relativity, provided only that we demand these
solutions do not possess naked quasi-regular singularities.

might have suffered from the force-free degeneracy of Beltrami fields are now
confirmed for shear flows where this degeneracy is lifted. For a dynamo that is
saturated near equipartition field strength those estimates result in a 5-fold
decrease of the magnetic diffusivity as the magnetic Reynolds number based on
the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies is increased from 2 to 600.

for neighborhood selection in Gaussian graphical models, under a neighborhood
stability condition, the LASSO is consistent, even when the number of variables
is of greater order than the sample size. Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine
Learning Research 7 2541--2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition
in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That
paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of
nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded
away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients
outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under
a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that
the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the
bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small
regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of
greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence
of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the
sum of error squares for the mean response and the $\ell_{\alpha}$-loss for the
regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given
conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the
number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain
random dependent designs.

data analysis in statistics. The sliced inverse regression (SIR) and canonical
correlation (CANCOR) methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of data by
replacing the explanatory variables with a small number of composite directions
without losing much information. However, the estimated composite directions
generally involve all of the variables, making their interpretation difficult.
To simplify the direction estimates, Ni, Cook and Tsai [Biometrika 92 (2005)
242--247] proposed the shrinkage sliced inverse regression (SSIR) based on SIR.
In this paper, we propose the constrained canonical correlation ($C^3$) method
based on CANCOR, followed by a simple variable filtering method. As a result,
each composite direction consists of a subset of the variables for
interpretability as well as predictive power. The proposed method aims to
identify simple structures without sacrificing the desirable properties of the
unconstrained CANCOR estimates. The simulation studies demonstrate the
performance advantage of the proposed $C^3$ method over the SSIR method. We
also use the proposed method in two examples for illustration.

size is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known
as fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and
generalized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a
subgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a
member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier,
to carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the
optimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a
criterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of
the fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many
predictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant.
We give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a
desirable property for a good model selection procedure. The methods are
illustrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.

the situation in the classical two-phase medium, cold, dense clumps form
through dynamically-triggered thermal instability in the compressed layer
between the convergent flows, and are often characterised by a sharp density
jump at their boundaries though not always. (2) However, the clumps are bounded
by phase-transition fronts rather than by contact discontinuities, and thus
they grow in size and mass mainly by accretion of WNM material through their
boundaries. (3) The clump boundaries generally consist of thin layers of
thermally unstable gas, but these layers are often widened by the turbulence,
and penetrate deep into the clumps. (4) The clumps are approximately in both
ram and thermal pressure balance with their surroundings, a condition which
causes their internal Mach numbers to be comparable to the bulk Mach number of
the colliding WNM flows. (5) The clumps typically have mean temperatures 20 < T
< 50 K, corresponding to the wide range of densities they contain (20 < n <
5000 pcc) under a nearly-isothermal equation of state. (6) The turbulent ram
pressure fluctuations of the WNM induce density fluctuations that then serve as
seeds for local gravitational collapse within the clumps. (7) The velocity and
magnetic fields tend to be aligned with each other within the clumps, although
both are significantly fluctuating, suggesting that the velocity tends to
stretch and align the magnetic field with it. (8) The typical mean field
strength in the clumps is a few times larger than that in the WNM. (9) The
magnetic field strength has a mean value of B ~ 6 mu G ...

central results, we characterize the laws which determine the value of the

2-norm distance dependent on the allowable power allocations and used
performance functions, is sufficient for the characterization of max-min fair

time-course behavior of neuronal responses, the semiparametric inference for
the underlying hemodynamic response function is developed to identify
significantly activated voxels. Under mild regularity conditions, we
demonstrate that a class of the proposed semiparametric test statistics, based
on the local linear estimation technique, follow $\chi^2$ distributions under
null hypotheses for a number of useful hypotheses. Furthermore, the asymptotic
power functions of the constructed tests are derived under the fixed and
contiguous alternatives. Simulation evaluations and real fMRI data application
suggest that the semiparametric inference procedure provides more efficient
detection of activated brain areas than the popular imaging analysis tools AFNI
and FSL.

likelihood using concave penalty functions. The nonconcave penalized likelihood
estimators enjoy the oracle properties, but maximizing the penalized likelihood
function is computationally challenging, because the objective function is
nondifferentiable and nonconcave. In this article, we propose a new unified
algorithm based on the local linear approximation (LLA) for maximizing the
penalized likelihood for a broad class of concave penalty functions.
Convergence and other theoretical properties of the LLA algorithm are
established. A distinguished feature of the LLA algorithm is that at each LLA
step, the LLA estimator can naturally adopt a sparse representation. Thus, we
suggest using the one-step LLA estimator from the LLA algorithm as the final
estimates. Statistically, we show that if the regularization parameter is
appropriately chosen, the one-step LLA estimates enjoy the oracle properties
with good initial estimators. Computationally, the one-step LLA estimation
methods dramatically reduce the computational cost in maximizing the nonconcave
penalized likelihood. We conduct some Monte Carlo simulation to assess the
finite sample performance of the one-step sparse estimation methods. The
results are very encouraging.

and the relatively simple surrounding HI shell structure allows us to constrain
the processes that may have led to its formation and to study conditions
leading to massive star formation. We use images from Hubble Space Telescope
and high resolution echelle spectrographic data from the Anglo-Australian
Telescope along with 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) spectrum survey data and the
shell catalogue derived from it to establish a likely evolutionary scenario
leading to the formation of NGC 602. We identify a distinct HI cloud component
that is likely the progenitor cloud of the cluster and HII region which
probably formed in blister fashion from the cloud's periphery. We also find
that the past interaction of HI shells can explain the current location and
radial velocity of the nebula. The surrounding Interstellar Medium is diffuse
and dust-poor as demonstrated by a low visual optical depth throughout the
nebula and an average HI density of the progenitor cloud estimated at 1 cm^-3.
These conditions suggest that the NGC 602 star formation event was produced by
compression and turbulence associated with HI shell interactions. It therefore
represents a single star forming event in a low gas density region.

terms in the exponential of path integral result in pre-exponent factor with
$\delta$-functions requiring vanishing metric discontinuities. Thereby path
integral measure in Regge calculus is related to path integral measure in Regge
calculus where length of an edge is not constrained to be the same for all the
4-tetrahedra containing this edge, i.e. in Regge calculus with independent
4-tetrahedra. The result obtained is in accordance with our previous one

models with cold dark matter together with a scalar field. We show that the

matter directly. The event rates and detailed signals expected in these
experiments depend on the dark matter phase space distribution on
sub-milliparsec scales. These scales are many orders of magnitude smaller than
those that can be resolved by conventional N-body simulations, so one cannot
hope to use such tools to investigate the effect of mergers in the history of
the Milky Way on the detailed phase-space structure probed by the current
experiments. In this paper we present an alternative approach to investigating
the results of such mergers, by studying a simplified model for a merger of a
sub-halo with a larger parent halo. With an appropriate choice of parent halo
potential, the evolution of material from the sub-halo can be expressed
analytically in action-angle variables, so it is possible to obtain its entire
orbit history very rapidly without numerical integration. Furthermore by
evolving backwards in time, we can obtain arbitrarily-high spatial resolution
for the current velocity distribution at a fixed point. Although this model
cannot provide a detailed quantitative comparison with the Milky Way, its
properties are sufficiently generic that it offers qualitative insight into the
expected structure arising from a merger at a resolution that cannot be
approached with full numerical simulations. Preliminary results indicate that
the velocity-space distribution of dark matter particles remains characterized
by discrete and well-defined peaks over an extended period of time, both for
single and multi-merging systems, in contrast to the simple smooth velocity
distributions sometimes assumed in predicting laboratory experiment detection
rates.

determined based on proximity to Nilson model levels. The resulting rates are
used in an r-process network calculation in which a supernova hot-bubble model
