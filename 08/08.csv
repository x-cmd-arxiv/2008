  <3","Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/592383",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that distant red galaxies (DRGs), which dominate
the high-mass end of the galaxy population at z~2.5, are more strongly
clustered than the population of blue star-forming galaxies at similar
redshifts. However these studies have been severely hampered by the small sizes
of fields having deep near-infrared imaging. Here we use the large UKIDSS Ultra
Deep Survey to study the clustering of DRGs. The size and depth of this survey
allows for an unprecedented measurement of the angular clustering of DRGs at
2<z_phot<3 and K<21. The correlation function shows the expected power law
behavior, but with an apparent upturn at theta<~10"". We deproject the angular
clustering to infer the spatial correlation length, finding 10.6+-1.6 h^-1 Mpc.
We use the halo occupation distribution framework to demonstrate that the
observed strong clustering of DRGs is not consistent with standard models of
galaxy clustering, confirming previous suggestions that were based on smaller
samples. Inaccurate photometric redshifts could artificially enhance the
observed clustering, however significant systematic redshift errors would be
required to bring the measurements into agreement with the models. Another
possibility is that the underlying assumption that galaxies interact with their
large-scale environment only through halo mass is not valid, and that other
factors drive the evolution of the oldest, most massive galaxies at z~2.

binary (LMXB) populations are associated with globular clusters (GCs). We have
established that the LMXB hosting frequency is correlated to various GC
properties such as mass and metallicity. While the X-ray luminosities of a few
of the brightest LMXBs in GCs are consistent with the accreting object being a
black hole (BH), the only definitive way to distinguish between a black hole
and multiple superposed sources in a GC is to detect variability. We have
discovered just such a variable 4x10^39 erg/s black hole X-ray binary in a low
metallicity globular cluster in the halo of NGC 4472. The change in the X-ray
spectrum between the bright and faint epochs suggests that the luminosity
variation is due to eclipsing by a warped accretion disk. The optical spectrum
of this source also reveals strong, broad, [O III] lambda 5007 and [O III]
lambda 4959 emission. An analysis of the X-ray spectrum suggests that the [O
III] lines are produced by the photoionization of a wind driven by a stellar
mass black hole accreting mass at or above its Eddington luminosity. As it is
dynamically implausible to form an accreting stellar mass BH system in a GC
with an intermediate mass BH it appears that this massive globular cluster does
not harbor an intermediate mass BH. The inferred mass of this BH falls well
below the extrapolation of the well known M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_Stellar
relations to this GC. Therefore our analysis suggests that not all old, metal
poor stellar systems form black holes consistent with these relations, which
have been established for much more massive stellar systems.

focus on the optimization of two design parameters associated with the LA: 1)
initial position upon LA update; 2) distance threshold for triggering of LA
update. Based on the popular continuous-time random walk (CTRW) mobility model,
we propose a novel analytical framework that uses a diffusion equation to
minimize the location management cost. In this framework, a number of
measurable physical parameters, such as length of road section, angle between
road sections, and road section crossing time, can be integrated into the
system design. This framework allows us to easily evaluate the total cost under
general call arrival distributions and LA of different shapes. For the
particular case of circular LA and small Poisson call-arrival rate, we prove
the following: (1) When the drift is weak, the optimal initial position
approaches the center of the LA; when the drift is strong, it approaches the
boundary of the LA. (2) Comparing the optimal initial-position and
center-initial-position solutions (which is assumed in most prior work), when
the drift is weak, the optimal distance threshold and the minimum total cost
are roughly equal; when the drift is strong, the optimal distance threshold in
the later is about 1.260 times that in the former, and the minimum total cost
in the later is about 1.587 times that in the former. That is, optimizing on
initial position, which previous work did not consider, has the potential of
reducing the cost measure by 37%.

speculated that the star is a close binary and similar to another unusual
eclipsing object, KH 15D. We have submitted V718 Per to a detailed photometric
and spectroscopic study to find out more about the properties of the stellar
object and the occulting circumstellar material, and to look for signatures of
a possible binary component. Our photometric data show that the eclipses are
very symmetric and persistent, and that the extinction deviates only little
from what is expected for normal interstellar material. The spectroscopic data,
obtained at minimum as well as at maximum brightness, indicate a primordial
abundance of Li and a surface effective temperature of about 5200 K.
Remarkably, the in-eclipse spectrum shows a significant broadening of the
photospheric absorption lines, as well as a weak increase in emission
components of H-alpha and the Ca II IR triplet. We did not detect any atomic or
molecular features from to the occulting body in the in-eclipse spectrum. We
also found no evidence of radial velocity changes in V718 Per to within about
+/- 80 m/s, which for an edge-on system corresponds to a maximum companion mass
of 6 Jupiter masses. Our observations suggest that V718 Per is a single star,
and thus very different from KH 15D. We conclude that V718 Per is surrounded by
an edge-on circumstellar disk with an irregular mass distribution orbiting at a
distance of 3.3 AU from the star, presumably at the inner disk edge. We ascribe
the broadening of photospheric absorption lines during the eclipse to forward
scattering of stellar light in the circumstellar dust feature.

paper, for stars with half a solar mass, for various effective temperatures
between 25000 K and 50000 K, and for various metallicities between solar and
1/100 solar, the mass loss rates are predicted as a function of the surface
gravity. With assumptions similar to the original theory of radiatively driven
winds, the method of solution of the momentum equation has been modified,
because the usual parametrization of the line force multiplier leads to
complications in the case of weak winds. According to the results, weak winds
with mass-loss rates of the order E-11 solar masses per year may exist only for
the most luminous sdB stars. For the more compact ones, the decoupling of the
metals from the bulk matter (hydrogen and helium) is expected in the wind
region, because the momentum exchange via Coulomb collisions is not effective
enough. Thus multicomponent effects are of great importance. For the case of
white dwarfs no wind solution exists at all, if multicomponent effects are

encountered in the upper photospheric layers of 3D model atmospheres of very

stronger in 3D than in 1D calculations. Hence, 3D elemental abundances derived
from such lines are significantly lower than estimated by analyses with 1D

abundant relative to the onset of cloud collapse. We find that global gravity
in a finite cloud has two crucial effects on cloud evolution. (a) Lateral
collapse (perpendicular to the flows sweeping up the cloud) leads to rapidly
increasing column densities above the accumulation from the one-dimensional
flow. This in turn allows fast formation of CO, allowing the molecular cloud to
``appear'' rapidly. (b) Global gravity is required to drive the dense gas to
the high pressures necessary to form solar-mass cores, in support of recent
analytical models of cloud fragmentation. While the clouds still appear
``supersonically turbulent'', this turbulence is relegated to playing a
secondary role, in that it is to some extent a consequence of gravitational

explained using only general relativity and cold dark matter with no dark
energy. In ""Swiss cheese"" models of the Universe, the standard
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker picture is modified by the introduction of mass
compensating spherical inhomogeneities, typically described by the
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric. If these inhomogeneities correspond to underdense
cores surrounded by mass-compensating overdense shells, then they can modify
the luminosity distance-redshift relation in a way that can mimic accelerated
expansion. It has been argued that this effect could be large enough to explain
the supernova data without introducing dark energy or modified gravity. We show
that the large apparent acceleration seen in some models can be explained in
terms of standard weak field gravitational lensing together with insufficient
randomization of void locations. The underdense regions focus the light less
than the homogeneous background, thus dimming supernovae in a way that can
mimic the effects of acceleration. With insufficient randomization of the
spatial location of the voids and of the lines of sight, coherent defocusing
can lead to anomalously large demagnification effects. We show that a proper
randomization of the voids and lines of sight reduces the effect to the point
that it can no longer explain the supernova data.

requirements can be relaxed, and it is possible to assign a permittivity and a
permeability to a composite structure, even if the metamaterial cannot be
considered homogeneous under the requirements stated above. However, the
effective permittivity and permeability in some cases may give rise to
unphysical, effective behaviors inside the medium, notwithstanding the fact
that they satisfy requirements like being Kramers-Kronig pairs, for example,

hard jets is motivated to include the leading contributions between the
propagating partons within the jet with partons radiated from a dense extended
medium. The resulting effective Lagrangian, containing both a leading and a
power suppressed (in the hard scale $Q^2$) contribution, arises primarily from
interactions between the hard collinear modes in the jet with Glauber modes
from the medium. In this first attempt, the interactions between the hard jet
and soft and collinear partonic modes have been ignored, in an effort to focus
solely on the interactions with the Glauber modes. While the effect of such
modes on vacuum cross sections are suppressed by powers of the hard scale
compared to the terms from the SCET Lagrangian, such sub-leading contributions
are enhanced by the extent of the medium and result in measurable corrections.
The veracity of the derived Lagrangian is checked by direct comparison with
known results from full QCD calculations of two physical observables: the
transverse momentum broadening of hard jets in dense media and a reanalysis of
the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF).

expected squared change) of individual incomes in the U.S. since the 1970s.
Existing measures of this trend abstract from individual heterogeneity,
effectively estimating an increase in average volatility. We decompose this
increase in average volatility and find that it is far from representative of
the experience of most people: there has been no systematic rise in volatility
for the vast majority of individuals. The rise in average volatility has been
driven almost entirely by a sharp rise in the income volatility of those
expected to have the most volatile incomes, identified ex-ante by large income
changes in the past. We document that the self-employed and those who
self-identify as risk-tolerant are much more likely to have such volatile

volatility than the population at large. These results color the policy

the effect of spin-charge separation at finite temperature both on the spectral
properties of single-particle fermionic excitations and on the conductivity of

decoherence due to electron-electron scattering, remains applicable to the

obtained for imaginary chemical potentials. The mu^2 and mu^4 coefficients are
found to be negative by both methods, with consistent absolute values.
Combining both methods gives evidence that also the mu^6 coefficient is
negative. Hence, on coarse N_t=4 lattices a three-flavour theory with m > m^c_0

km/s), centered at the stellar velocity, and spatially unresolved at scales of
0.4 arcsec, which is consistent with origin from a disk at radii 10-50 AU from

less than a few Earth masses. Such warm gas temperatures are significantly
higher than the equilibrium dust temperatures at these radii, suggesting that

a cluster at a given radius is not balanced entirely by the thermal gas
pressure of the hot ICM, with theoretical studies emphasizing the role of
random turbulent motions to provide the necessary additional pressure support.
Using a set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters
that include radiative cooling and star formation, we find instead that in the
most relaxed clusters rotational support exceeds that from random turbulent
motions for radii 0.1 - 0.5 r_500, and that the observed clusters are much
rounder than the simulated, relaxed clusters within ~ 0.4 r_500. Moreover,
while the observed clusters display an average ellipticity profile that does
not vary significantly with radius, the ellipticity of the relaxed CDM clusters
declines markedly with increasing radius, suggesting that the ICM of the
observed clusters rotates less rapidly than that of the relaxed CDM clusters
out to ~ 0.6 r_500. We also find the ellipticity profile of a simulated cluster
without radiative cooling is in much better agreement with the observations,
implying that over-cooling has a substantial impact on the gas dynamics and
morphology out to larger radii than previously recognized. It also suggests
that the 10%-20% systematic errors from non-thermal gas pressure support
reported for simulated cluster masses, obtained from fitting simulated X-ray
data over large radial ranges within r_500, may need to be revised downward.
These results demonstrate the utility of X-ray ellipticity profiles as a probe

that boundary correlations can be computed order by order in an asymptotic

largely ignore the important physics of star formation and the interstellar
medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxies that include a
treatment of the molecular ISM and star formation in molecular clouds
(Robertson & Kravtsov 2008), we study the influence of star formation
efficiency and molecular hydrogen abundance on the properties of high-redshift
galaxy populations. In this work, we focus on a model of low-mass, star forming
galaxies at 1<~z<~2 that may host long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Observations of GRB hosts have revealed a population of faint systems with star
formation properties that often differ from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and
more luminous high-redshift field galaxies. Observed GRB sightlines are
deficient in molecular hydrogen, but it is unclear to what degree this
deficiency owes to intrinsic properties of the galaxy or the impact the GRB has
on its environment. We find that hydrodynamical simulations of low-stellar mass
systems at high-redshifts can reproduce the observed star formation rates and
efficiencies of GRB host galaxies at redshifts 1<~z<~2. We show that the
compact structure of low-mass high-redshift GRB hosts may lead to a molecular
ISM fraction of a few tenths, well above that observed in individual GRB
sightlines. However, the star formation rates of observed GRB host galaxies
imply molecular gas masses of 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun similar to those produced in
the simulations, and may therefore imply fairly large average H_2 fractions in
their ISM.

comparing the mass reconstructed adopting an observational-like approach with
the true mass in the simulations. X-ray surface brightness and temperature

adopting different radial fitting ranges in order to investigate modeling and

compelling progress has been confined to the edge-update model: maintain an
understanding of connectivity in an undirected graph, subject to edge
insertions and deletions. In this paper, we study two more challenging, yet
equally fundamental problems.
  Subgraph connectivity asks to maintain an understanding of connectivity under
vertex updates: updates can turn vertices on and off, and queries refer to the
subgraph induced by ""on"" vertices. (For instance, this is closer to
applications in networks of routers, where node faults may occur.)
  We describe a data structure supporting vertex updates in O (m^{2/3})
amortized time, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This greatly
improves over the previous result [Chan, STOC'02], which required fast matrix
multiplication and had an update time of O(m^0.94). The new data structure is
also simpler.
  Geometric connectivity asks to maintain a dynamic set of n geometric objects,
and query connectivity in their intersection graph. (For instance, the
intersection graph of balls describes connectivity in a network of sensors with
bounded transmission radius.)
  Previously, nontrivial fully dynamic results were known only for special
cases like axis-parallel line segments and rectangles. We provide similarly
improved update times, O (n^{2/3}), for these special cases. Moreover, we show
how to obtain sublinear update bounds for virtually all families of geometric

conducting capillary fluid on a planar fixed plate in the presence of gravity
and a uniform magnetic field. We first confirm that the Squire transformation
for MHD is compatible with the stress and insulating boundary conditions at the
free surface, but argue that unless the flow is driven at fixed Galilei and
capillary numbers, the critical mode is not necessarily two-dimensional. We
then investigate numerically how a flow-normal magnetic field, and the
associated Hartmann steady state, affect the soft and hard instability modes of
free surface flow, working in the low magnetic Prandtl number regime of
laboratory fluids. Because it is a critical layer instability, the hard mode is
found to exhibit similar behaviour to the even unstable mode in channel
Hartmann flow, in terms of both the weak influence of Pm on its neutral
stability curve, and the dependence of its critical Reynolds number Re_c on the
Hartmann number Ha. In contrast, the structure of the soft mode's growth rate
contours in the (Re, alpha) plane, where alpha is the wavenumber, differs
markedly between problems with small, but nonzero, Pm, and their counterparts
in the inductionless limit. As derived from large wavelength approximations,
and confirmed numerically, the soft mode's critical Reynolds number grows
exponentially with Ha in inductionless problems. However, when Pm is nonzero
the Lorentz force originating from the steady state current leads to a
modification of Re_c(Ha) to either a sublinearly increasing, or decreasing
function of Ha, respectively for problems with insulating and conducting walls.
In the former, we also observe pairs of Alfven waves, the upstream propagating
wave undergoing an instability at large Alfven numbers.

$^{12}_\Lambda$C, $^{16}_\Lambda$O, and $^{28}_\Lambda$Si, as a function of the
sum of kinetic energies $E_{nN}=E_n+E_N$ for $N=n,p$. The strangeness-changing
transition potential is described by the one-meson-exchange model, with
commonly used parameterization. Two versions of the Independent-Particle Shell
Model (IPSM) are employed to account for the nuclear structure of the final
residual nuclei. They are: (a) IPSM-a, where no correlation, except for the
Pauli principle, is taken into account, and (b) IPSM-b, where the highly
excited hole states are considered to be quasi-stationary and are described by
Breit-Wigner distributions, whose widths are estimated from the experimental
data. All $np$ and $nn$ spectra exhibit a series of peaks in the energy
interval 110 MeV $<E_{nN}<170$ MeV, one for each occupied shell-model state.
The IPSM-a could be a pretty fair approximation for the light $^{4}_\Lambda$He
and $^{5}_\Lambda$He hypernuclei. For the remaining, heavier, hypernuclei it is
very important, however, to take into account the spreading in strength of the
deep-hole states, and bring into play the IPSM-b approach. Notwithstanding the
nuclear model that is employed the results depend only very weakly on the
details of the dynamics involved in the decay process proper. We propose that
the IPSM is the appropriate lowest-order approximation for the theoretical
calculations of the of kinetic energy sum spectra in the NMWD. It is in
comparison to this picture that one should appraise the effects of the final
state interactions and of the two-nucleon-induced decay mode.

hot spring environments have revealed surprisingly complex ecosystems, with an
unexpected level of genetic diversity. One case of particular interest involves
the distribution along hot spring thermal gradients of genetically distinct
bacterial strains that differ in their preferred temperatures for reproduction
and photosynthesis. In such systems, a single variable, temperature, defines
the relevant environmental variation. In spite of this, each region along the
thermal gradient exhibits multiple strains of photosynthetic bacteria adapted
to several distinct thermal optima, rather than the expected single thermal
strain adapted to the local environmental temperature. Here we analyze
microbiology data from several ecological studies to show that the thermal
distribution field data exhibit several universal features independent of
location and specific bacterial strain. These include the distribution of
optimal temperatures of different thermal strains and the functional dependence
of the net population density on temperature. Further, we present a simple
population dynamics model of these systems that is highly constrained by
biophysical data and by physical features of the environment. This model can
explain in detail the observed diversity of different strains of the
photosynthetic bacteria. It also reproduces the observed thermal population
distributions, as well as certain features of population dynamics observed in

model of human brain proposed by Justo Gonzalo (1910-1986), in relation to what
he called central syndrome (caused by unilateral lesion in the
parieto-occipital cortex, equidistant from the visual, tactile and auditory
projection areas). The syndrome is featured by a bilateral, symmetric and
multisensory involvement, and by a functional depression with dynamic effects
dependent on the neural mass lost and related to physiological laws of nervous
excitability. Inverted or tilted vision as well as tactile and auditive
inversion, under minimum stimulus, appears as a stage of incomplete
integration, being almost corrected under higher stimulus or facilitation by
multisensory integration. The syndrome reveals aspects of the brain dynamics
that suggest a functional continuity and unity of the cortex. A functional
gradients scheme was proposed in which the specificity of the cortex is
distributed with a continuous variation. This syndrome is interpreted as a
scale reduction in the nervous excitability of the system, the different
sensory qualities being affected allometricaly according to scaling laws. A
continuity from lower to higher sensory functions was proposed. The sensory
growth by an increase of the stimulus or by multisensory facilitation is found
to follow approximately power laws, that would reflect basic laws of biological
neural networks. We restrict the analysis to the visual system.

300 to 500K, with a minimum detrimental effect on the intrinsic properties of
the material. The strain engineering has been largely applied to the materials
in thin film form, where the strain is generated as a result of lattice
mismatch between the substrate and component film or between layers in
multilayer structures. Here, we report the observation of residual thermal
stress/strain in dense SiC-MgB2 superconductor composites prepared by a
diffusion method. We demonstrate that the thermal strain caused by the
different thermal expansion coefficients between the MgB2 and SiC phases is
responsible for the significant improvement in the critical current density,
Jc, the irreversibility field, Hirr, and the upper critical field, Hc2, in the
SiC-MgB2 composite where the carbon substitution level is low. In contrast to
the common practice of improving the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2 through chemical
substitution, by taking advantage of residual thermal strains we are able to
design a composite, which shows only a small drop in Tc and little increase in
resistivity, but a significant improvement over the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2. The
present findings open up a new direction for manipulation of materials

that the rms variability amplitudes of the sources correlate with the emission

sight. We thus link the variations with interstellar scintillation of
components of these sources, with some (unknown) fraction of the total flux
density contained within a compact region of angular diameter in the range
10-50 micro-arcseconds. We also find that the variations decrease for high mean
flux density sources and, most importantly, for high redshift sources. The
decrease in variability is probably due either to an increase in the apparent
diameter of the source, or a decrease in the flux density of the compact
fraction beyond z ~ 2. Here we present a statistical analysis of these results,

as the Intermediate Phase. Glass compositions at x < 0.095 are stressed-rigid,
while those at x > 0.378 elastically flexible. Raman optical elasticity
power-laws, trends in the nature of the glass transition endotherms corroborate
the three elastic phase assignments. Ionic conductivities reveal a step-like
increase when glasses become stress-free at x > xc(1) = 0.095, and a
logarithmic increase in conductivity (sigma ~ (x-xc(2)t) once they become
flexible at x > xc(2) = 0.378 with a power-law t = 1.78. The power-law is
consistent with percolation of 3D filamentary conduction pathways. Traces of
water doping lower Tg and narrow the reversibility window, and can also
completely collapse it. Ideas on network flexibility promoting ion-conduction
are in harmony with the unified approach of Ingram et al., who have emphasized
the similarity of process compliance or elasticity relating to ion-transport
and structural relaxation in decoupled systems. Boson mode frequency and
scattering strength display thresholds that coincide with the two elastic phase
boundaries. In particular, the scattering strength of the boson mode increases
almost linearly with glass composition x, with a slope that tracks the floppy
mode fraction as a function of mean coordination number r predicted by
mean-field rigidity theory. These data suggest that the excess low frequency
vibrations contributing to boson mode in flexible glasses come largely from
floppy modes.

turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection cell with aspect ratio unity. The
temperature-extremum-extraction (TEE) method for obtaining the dynamic
information of the LSC is presented. With this method, the azimuthal angular
positions of the hot ascending and cold descending flows along the sidewall are
identified from the measured instantaneous azimuthal temperature profile. The
motion of the LSC is then decomposed into two different modes: the azimuthal
mode and the translational or off-center mode. Comparing to the previous
sinusoidal-fitting (SF) method, it is found that both methods give the same
information about the azimuthal motion of the LSC, but the TEE method in
addition can provide information about the off-center motion of the LSC, which
is found to oscillate time-periodically around the cell's central vertical axis
with an amplitude being nearly independent of the turbulent intensity. It is
further found that the azimuthal angular positions of the hot ascending flow
near the bottom plate and the cold descending flow near the top plate oscillate
periodically out of phase by $\pi$, leading to the torsional mode of the LSC.
These oscillations are then propagated vertically along the sidewall by the hot
ascending and cold descending fluids. When they reach the mid-height plane, the
azimuthal positions of the hottest and coldest fluids again oscillate out of
phase by $\pi$. It is this out-of-phase horizontal positional oscillation of
the hottest and coldest fluids at the same horizontal plane that produces the
off-center oscillation of the LSC. A direct velocity measurement further
confirms the existence of the bulk off-center mode of the flow field near cell
center.

engine became active again after the main burst produced by the first ejecta,
then drove another more collimated jet-like ejecta with a larger viewing angle.
The two ejecta both interacted with the ambient medium, giving rise to forward
shocks that propagated into the ambient medium and reverse shocks that
penetrated into the ejecta. The total emission was a combination of the
emissions from the reverse- and forward- shocked regions. We discuss how this
combined emission accounts for the observed rebrightening. Methods. We apply
numerical models to calculate the light curves from the shocked regions, which
include a forward shock originating in the first ejecta and a forward-reverse
shock for the second ejecta. Results. We find evidence that the central engine
became active again 2000 s after the main burst. The combined emission produced
by interactions of these two ejecta with the ambient medium can describe the
properties of the afterglow of this burst. We argue that the rapid rise in
brightness at ~ 3000 s in the afterglow is due to the off-axis emission from
the second ejecta. The precession of the torus or accretion disk of the central
engine is a natural explanation for the departure of the second ejecta from the
line of sight.

outside the field-of-view of the primary beam. The kinematics of the molecular
structures are quite regular, although there is evidence for local non-circular
or streaming motions. We show that the molecular gas distribution is similar
but not exactly identical to those of star formation tracers. Using a NIR image
obtained with adaptive optics at the CFHT Telescope, we identify a weak bar in
NGC 3147, which is classified as non-barred galaxy in the optical. We then
compute the gravity torques exerted by this stellar bar on the gas. We find
that the gas inside the inner CO ring is subject to a net negative torque and
loses angular momentum. This is expected for gas at the UHR, just inside the
corotation resonance of the stellar bar. In contrast, the gas outside
corotation, in the spiral arms comprising the outer spiral structure, suffers
positive torques and is driven outwards. We conclude that some molecular gas is
presently flowing into the central region, since we find negative torques down
to the resolution limit of our images.

requirements of a MOAO-fed integral field spectrograph on either an 8m or 42m
telescope. Our simulations re-scales observations of local galaxies or results
from numerical simulations of disk or interacting galaxies. For the current
analysis, we limit ourselves to a local disk galaxy which exhibits simple
rotation and a simulation of a merger. We have attempted to generalize our
results by introducing the simple concepts of ""PSF contrast"" which is the
amount of light polluting adjacent spectra which we find drives the smallest EE
at a given spatial scale. The choice of the spatial sampling is driven by the
""scale-coupling"", i.e., the relationship between the IFU pixel scale and the
size of the features that need to be recovered by 3D spectroscopy in order to
understand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure. Because the dynamical
nature of galaxies are mostly reflected in their large-scale motions, a
relatively coarse spatial resolution is enough to distinguish between a
rotating disk and a major merger. Although we used a limited number of
morpho-kinematic cases, our simulations suggest that, on a 42m telescope, the
choice of an IFU pixel scale of 50-75 mas seems to be sufficient. Such a coarse
sampling has the benefit of lowering the exposure time to reach a specific
signal-to-noise as well as relaxing the performance of the MOAO system. On the
other hand, recovering the full 2D-kinematics of z~4 galaxies requires high
signal-to-noise and at least an EE of 34% in 150 mas (2 pixels of 75 mas).
Finally, we carried out a similar study at z=1.6 with a MOAO-fed spectrograph
for an 8m, and find that at least an EE of 30% at 0.25 arcsec spatial sampling
is required to understand the nature of disks and mergers.

magnetic and electric properties. In microwaves, a local ME effect appears due
to the dynamical symmetry breakings of magnetic-dipolar modes (MDMs) in a
ferrite disk particle. The fact that for MDMs in a ferrite disk one has evident
both classical and quantum-like attributes, puts special demands on the methods
used for study of interacting ME particles. A proper model for coupled
particles should be based on the spectral characteristics of MDM oscillations
and an analysis of the overlap integrals for interacting eigen oscillating ME
elements. In this paper, we present theoretical studies of spectral properties
of literally coupled of MDM ME disks. We show that there exists the ""exchange""
mechanism of interaction between the particles, which is distinctive from the

  P2P networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are optimized for single

Construction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix
search, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by
creating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only
information available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning
tree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of
messages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as
a regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime
behavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix
search or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC
algorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the
performance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing
application-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30-250% fewer

Using the generalised Ohm's law we find that the parallel electric field is
supported mostly by the electron pressure tensor, with a smaller contribution
from the electron inertia term. (ii) The generated parallel electric field and
the fraction of accelerated electrons are independent of the IC wave frequency
remaining at a level of six orders of magnitude larger than the Dreicer value
and approximately 20% respectively. The generated parallel electric field and
the fraction of accelerated electrons increase with the increase of IC wave
amplitude. The generated parallel electric field seems to be independent of
plasma beta, while the fraction of accelerated electrons strongly increases
with the decrease of plasma beta (for plasma beta of 0.0001 the fraction of
accelerated electrons can be as large as 47%). (iii) In the collisionless
regime IC wave dissipation length (that is defined as the distance over which
the wave damps) variation with the driving frequency shows a deviation from the
analytical MHD result, which we attribute to a possible frequency dependence of
the effective resistivity. (iv) Effective anomalous resistivity, inferred from
our numerical simulations, is at least four orders of magnitude larger than the

a Hamiltonian constraint is just a gauge transformation on the phase space and
therefore does not change the physical state. The basis for this belief is a
theorem of Dirac that identifies primary first-class constraints as generators
of physically irrelevant motions. We point out that certain assumptions on
which Dirac based his argument do not hold for reparametrization invariant
systems, and show that the primary Hamiltonian constraint of these systems does
generate physical motion. We show explicitly how the argument fails for systems
described by Jacobi's principle, which has a structure closely resembling that
of general relativity. We defer discussion of general relativity and the
implications for quantum gravity to a later paper.

Wolfson","On the incidence-prevalence relation and length-biased sampling","20 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For many diseases, logistic and other constraints often render large
incidence studies difficult, if not impossible, to carry out. This becomes a
drawback, particularly when a new incidence study is needed each time the
disease incidence rate is investigated in a different population. However, by
carrying out a prevalent cohort study with follow-up it is possible to estimate
the incidence rate if it is constant. In this paper we derive the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) of the overall incidence rate, $\lambda$, as well as
age-specific incidence rates, by exploiting the well known epidemiologic
relationship, prevalence = incidence $\times$ mean duration ($P = \lambda
\times \mu$). We establish the asymptotic distributions of the MLEs, provide
approximate confidence intervals for the parameters, and point out that the MLE
of $\lambda$ is asymptotically most efficient. Moreover, the MLE of $\lambda$
is the natural estimator obtained by substituting the marginal maximum
likelihood estimators for P and $\mu$, respectively, in the expression $P =
\lambda \times \mu$. Our work is related to that of Keiding (1991, 2006), who,
using a Markov process model, proposed estimators for the incidence rate from a
prevalent cohort study \emph{without} follow-up, under three different
scenarios. However, each scenario requires assumptions that are both disease
specific and depend on the availability of epidemiologic data at the population
level. With follow-up, we are able to remove these restrictions, and our
results apply in a wide range of circumstances. We apply our methods to data
collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing to estimate the
incidence rate of dementia amongst elderly Canadians.

of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of
the LCDM cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting
black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic
scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets
that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a
comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational
measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold
gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation
rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential
cutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities
at z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,
quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of
self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH
mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in our
models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation,
stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the
""concordance"" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at
high redshift (z>2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star
formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar
mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in
quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4).

the basis of the root lattice A4 or its dual. Properties of these lattices are
thus related to properties of the Penrose tiling. Moreover, the root lattice A4
appears in various other contexts such as sphere packings, efficient coding
schemes and lattice quantizers.
  Here, the lattice A4 is considered within the icosian ring, whose rich
arithmetic structure leads to parametrisations of the similar sublattices and
the coincidence rotations of A4 and its dual lattice. These parametrisations,
both in terms of a single icosian, imply an index formula for the corresponding
sublattices. The results are encapsulated in Dirichlet series generating
functions. For every index, they provide the number of distinct similar
sublattices as well as the number of coincidence rotations of A4 and its dual.

single-stranded nucleic acids. We present here a theoretical investigation of
the mechanism of these reactions in vitro under thermal conditions (dilute
solutions of single-stranded chains, in the presence of molar concentrations of
monovalent salts and at elevated temperatures). The mechanism follows a
Kramers' process, whereby the complementary chains overcome a potential barrier
through Brownian motion. The barrier originates from a single rate-limiting
nucleation event in which the first complementary base pairs are formed. The
reaction then proceeds through a fast growth of the double helix. For the DNA
of bacteriophages T7, T4 and $\phi$X174 as well as for Escherichia coli DNA,
the bimolecular rate $k_2$ of the reaction increases as a power law of the
average degree of polymerization $<N>$ of the reacting single- strands: $k_2
\prop <N>^\alpha$. This relationship holds for $100 \leq <N> \leq 50 000$ with
an experimentally determined exponent $\alpha = 0.51 \pm 0.01$. The length
dependence results from a thermodynamic excluded-volume effect. The reacting
single-stranded chains are predicted to be in universal good solvent
conditions, and the scaling law is determined by the relevant equilibrium
monomer contact probability. The value theoretically predicted for the exponent
is $\alpha = 1-\nu \theta_2$, where $\nu$ is Flory's swelling exponent ($nu
approx 0.588$) and $\theta_2$ is a critical exponent introduced by des
Cloizeaux ($\theta_2 \approx 0.82$), yielding $\alpha = 0.52 \pm 0.01$, in
agreement with the experimental results.
