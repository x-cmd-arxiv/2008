a function of galaxy type. This galaxy bias acts as a hindrance to the
extraction of cosmological information from the galaxy power spectrum or
correlation function. Theoretical arguments show that a change in the amplitude
of the clustering between galaxies and mass on large-scales is unavoidable, but
cosmological information can be easily extracted from the shape of the power
spectrum or correlation function if this bias is independent of scale.
Scale-dependent bias is generally small on large scales, k<0.1 h.Mpc^{-1}, but
on smaller scales can affect the recovery of \Omega_m.h from the measured shape
of the clustering signal, and have a small effect on the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations. In this paper we investigate the transition from
scale-independent to scale-dependent galaxy bias as a function of galaxy
population. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR5 sample to fit various
models, which attempt to parametrise the turn-off from scale-independent
behaviour. For blue galaxies, we find that the strength of the turn-off is
strongly dependent on galaxy luminosity, with stronger scale-dependent bias on
larger scales for more luminous galaxies. For red galaxies, the
scale-dependence is a weaker function of luminosity. Such trends need to be
modelled in order to optimally extract the information available in future
surveys, and can help with the design of such surveys.

embeddings if and only if for each i=0,...,s the i-th derivative of the map f

robots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have
simple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore,
their kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel
robot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic
model, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots
are determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is
geometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic
model. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of
freedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted.
Finally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations
performed on an actual robot prototype are presented.

variational principles of physics in general and a possible way to unify the
axiomatizations of mechanics theories. The leitmotif of this work is a
dialectical view of the world: any smooth motion in nature is the consequence
of the interplay and dynamical balance between pairs of opposite elements of
the motion. We stress that the opposite property here differs from the common
sense of opposing elements (of conflicting appearance but of same nature) such
action/reaction forces between two bodies. The opposite elements here are
incompatible and mutual exclusive in nature, with contrasting and complementary
characteristics such as active/passive, disorder/order, curvature/flatness,
etc. The dynamical balance is defined by an invariant variational relationship
between all the pairs of opposite elements active in the considered motion.
From this idea, an axiomatization of quantum mechanics is proposed in addition
to the derivation of several existing variational principles of mechanics.

evaporation at T~ 25-30 K. We are able to reproduce most of the observed
molecular abundances in L1527 at a time of ~5000 yr. At later times, the
overall abundance of anions become greater than that of electrons, which has an
impact on many organic species and ions. The anion-to-neutral ratio in our

explain this difference, further investigation is needed on the rate

Since the experimental analysis of scattering data commonly involves

automorphic forms; each automorphic integral has an additional period function
in its automorphic relation. The period functions satisfy relations that arise
from the underlying group relations. Knopp showed that entire automorphic
integrals with rational period functions satisfy a Hecke correspondence
theorem, provided the rational period functions have poles only at 0 or
infinity. For other automorphic integrals each corresponding Dirichlet series
has a functional equation with a remainder term that arises from the nonzero
poles of the rational period function.
  In this paper we prove a Hecke correspondence theorem for a class of
automorphic integrals with rational period functions on the Hecke groups. We
restrict our attention to automorphic integrals of weight that is twice an odd
integer and to rational period functions that satisfy a symmetry property we
call ""Hecke-symmetry."" We explicate the relationship between the structure of
the rational period functions and the corresponding remainder terms. Each
remainder term satisfies two relations (the second of which is new in this

remnant may comprise a central solar-mass black hole surrounded by a 0.01-0.1

for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). A comparable amount of mass is ejected into
eccentric orbits and will eventually fall back to the merger site after
approximately 0.01 seconds. In this Paper, we investigate analytically the fate
of the fallback matter, which may provide a luminous signal long after the disc
is exhausted. We find that matter in the eccentric tail returns at a
super-Eddington rate and is eventually (0.1 sec) unable to cool via neutrino
emission and accrete all the way to the black hole. Therefore, contrary to
previous claims, our analysis suggests that fallback matter is not an efficient
source of late time accretion power and is unlikely to cause the late flaring
activity observed in SGRB afterglows. The fallback matter rather forms a
radiation-driven wind or a bound atmosphere. In both cases, the emitting plasma
is very opaque and photons are released with a degraded energy in the X-ray
band. We therefore suggest that compact binary mergers could be followed by an
""X-ray renaissance"", as late as several days to weeks after the merger. This
might be observed by the next generation of X-ray detectors.

represented well by the Gaussian distribution, dN/dy(Gaussian) \exp[-y^2/2L].
Past successes of the Gaussian distribution in explaining experimental rapidity
data can be understood, not because it is an approximation of the original
Landau distribution, but because it is in fact a close representation of the
modified distribution. Predictions for pp and AA collisions at LHC energies in
Landau hydrodynamics are presented.

pair of weakly coupled two-dimensional systems to a strongly coupled exciton
system as the barrier between the layers is reduced. Once excitons form,
phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons could be observed. In
our devices, electrons and holes are confined in double quantum wells, and
carriers in the devices are induced with top and bottom gates leading to
variable density in each layer. Separate contact to each layer allows Coulomb
drag transport measurements where current is driven in one layer while voltage
is measured in the other. Coulomb drag is sensitive to interlayer coupling and
has been predicted to provide a strong signature of exciton condensation. Drag
measurement on EHBLs with a 30 nm barrier are consistent with drag between two
weakly coupled 2D Fermi systems where the drag decreases as the temperature is
reduced. When the barrier is reduced to 20 nm, we observe a consistent increase
in the drag resistance as the temperature is reduced. These results indicate
the onset of a much stronger coupling between the electrons and holes which
leads to exciton formation and possibly phenomena related to exciton
condensation.

One of the most fundamental effects in nanoplasmonics is nano-concentration of

achieved. It will be very beneficial for the fundamental science, engineering,
environmental, and defense applications to be able to nano-concentrate
terahertz radiation (frequency 1 - 10 THz or vacuum wavelength 300 - 30
microns). This will allow for the nanoscale spatial resolution for THz imaging
and introduce the THz spectroscopy on the nanoscale, taking full advantage of
the rich THz spectra and submicron to nanoscale structures of many engineering,
physical, and biological objects of wide interest: electronic components
(integrated circuits, etc.), bacteria, their spores, viruses, macromolecules,
carbon clusters and nanotubes, etc. In this Letter we establish the principal
limits for the nanoconcentration of the THz radiation in metal/dielectric
waveguides and determine their optimum shapes required for this

from the initial spot size of light wavelength to the final size of R = 100 -
250 nm can be achieved with the THz radiation intensity increased by a factor
of 10 to 250. This THz energy nanoconcentration will not only improve the

in. We simultaneously model the azimuthally averaged intensity profile of the
nebula and the observed spectral energy distribution using spherical dust
radiative transfer models. The models indicate a constant mass-loss process
over the past 1000 years, for mass-loss rates a few times 10^(-7) Msun/yr. This
work supports the idea that at least part of the asymmetries in shells of
evolved massive stars and supernovae may be due to the mass-loss process in the
red supergiant phase.

show that, in a low-dimensional self-assembled dipolar crystal, the parabolic
optical confinement potential can also strongly affect the quantum many-body
properties in the low temperature regime. For example, by changing the
confinement aspect ratio, the bulk of the system can undergo a quantum phase
transition between a liquid state and a solid state via a nonmonotonic pattern
formation of the domain wall. Furthermore, the entropy of a trapped dipolar
crystal can be much larger than the liquid state in the weak dipole limit,
indicating an intrinsic polarization cooling mechanism via increasing the
external field. These highly correlated confinement effects are very important
to the experimental preparation of a self-assembled dipolar crystal using
ultracold polar molecules.

indicating smaller orbital overlap between Fe $d$ states and subsequently
enhanced intra-atomic exchange coupling. The calculated Fermi surface in the NM

idea of the co-evolution of elliptical galaxies and of their SMBHs has become a
central topic of modern astrophysics. Here, I summarize some consequences that
can be derived from the galaxy Scaling Laws (SLs) and present a coherent
scenario for the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and their
central SMBHs, focusing in particular on the establishment and maintenance of
their SLs. In particular, after a first observationally based part, the
discussion focuses on the physical interpretation of the Fundamental Plane.
Then, two important processes in principle able to destroy the galaxy and SMBH
SLs, namely galaxy merging and cooling flows, are analyzed. Arguments
supporting the necessity to clearly distinguish between the origin and
maintenance of the different SLs, and the unavoidable occurrence of SMBH
feedback on the galaxy ISM in the late stages of galaxy evolution (when
elliptical galaxies are sometimes considered as ``dead, red objects''), are
then presented. At the end of the paper I will discuss some implications of the
recent discovery of super-dense ellipticals in the distant Universe. In
particular, I will argue that, if confirmed, these new observations would lead
to the conclusion that at early epochs a relation between the stellar mass of
the galaxy and the mass of the central SMBH should hold, consistent with the
present day Magorrian relation, while the proportionality coefficient between
Mbh and the scale of velocity dispersion of the hosting spheroids should be
significantly smaller than that at the present epoch.

We give examples for two kinds of polarizers. The first kind presents an

total reflection at the interface with a birefringent medium. Using the Stokes
vector representation, we determine explicitly the trajectories of the wave
light polarization during the polarization process. We find that such
trajectories are not always geodesics of the Poincar\'e sphere as it is usually
thought. Using the analogy between light polarization and special relativity,
we find that the action of successive polarizers on the light wave polarization
is equivalent to the action of a single resulting polarizer followed by a
rotation achieved for example by a device with optical activity. We find a
composition law for polarizers similar to the composition law for noncollinear
velocities in special relativity. We define an angle equivalent to the
relativistic Wigner angle which can be used to quantify the quality of two
composed polarizers.

""Temperature duality"" symmetry, ${\cal F}(T/T_H)={T^2\over T_H^2} {\cal

exploiting the polynomial structure of the equations, this result can be used
