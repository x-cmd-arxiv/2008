nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0, when the
down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor
asymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0
u-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase is formed.
The s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density, when
the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically generated
strange quark mass. We construct two different hybrid equations of state (EoS)
using the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and the EoS by Shen et
al in the nuclear matter sector. The corresponding hybrid star sequences have
maximum masses of, respectively, 2.1 and 2.0 M_solar. Two- and three-flavor
quark-matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star
solutions in the DBHF case, while the Shen-based EoS produce stable
configurations with a 2SC phase component in the core of massive stars. Nucleon
dissociation due to d-quark drip at the crust-core boundary fulfills basic
criteria for a deep crustal heating process which is required to explain
superbusts as well as cooling of X-ray transients.

lead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl
radical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic
inflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the
involvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a
large number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and
inflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation
of cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many
similarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e.
iron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The
studies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic
and neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and
lesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and
longevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is
thus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As
systems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have
multiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent
patterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of
multiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the
decidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...

due to the mechanism responsible for the structure of the Yukawa couplings. We
study model independently the compatibility between low energy flavor and CP
constraints and observability of superparticles at the LHC, assuming a generic
correlation between the Yukawa couplings and the supersymmetry breaking
parameters. We find that the superpotential operators that generate scalar
trilinear interactions are generically problematic. We discuss several ways in
which this tension is naturally avoided. In particular, we focus on several
frameworks in which the dangerous operators are naturally absent. These
frameworks can be combined with many theories of flavor, including those with
(flat or warped) extra dimensions, strong dynamics, or flavor symmetries. We
show that the resulting theories can avoid all the low energy constraints while
keeping the superparticles light. The intergenerational mass splittings among
the sfermions can reflect the structure of the underlying flavor theory, and
can be large enough to be measurable at the LHC. Detailed observations of the

$\alpha{\rho_m}{\dot\phi}$ (case I) and $3\beta H (\rho_\phi +\rho_m)$ (case
II) between the phantom energy and dark matter are examined with the potential
for the phantom field taken to be exponential. For both kinds of interactions,
we find that the future singularity appearing in the standard FRW cosmology can
be avoided by loop quantum gravity effects. In case II, if the phantom field is
initially rolling down the potential, the loop quantum effect has no influence
on the cosmic late time evolution and the universe will accelerate forever with
a constant energy ratio between the dark energy and dark matter.

that the decoy state method can close this loophole and substantially improve

Moreover, we apply the methods from entanglement distillation protocols based

Furthermore, we study the decoy state methods for other single photon sources,
such as triggering parametric down-conversion (PDC) source.
  We propose a model and post-processing scheme for the entanglement-based QKD
with a PDC source. Although the model is proposed to study the
entanglement-based QKD, we emphasize that our generic model may also be useful
for other non-QKD experiments involving a PDC source. By simulating a real PDC

secure distance than the single-photon-based QKD schemes.
  We present a time-shift attack that exploits the efficiency mismatch of two
single photon detectors in a QKD system. This eavesdropping strategy can be
realized by current technology. We also discuss counter measures against the

contributions and controversy over what exactly a quantized game really is and
if there is indeed anything new for game theory. What has clouded many of the
issues is the lack of a mathematical formalism for the subject in which these
various issues can be clearly and precisely expressed, and which provides a
context in which to present their resolution. Such a formalism is presented
here, along with proposed resolutions to some of the issues discussed in the
literature. One in particular, the question of whether there can exist
equilibria in a quantized version of a game that do not correspond to classical
correlated equilibria of that game and also deliver better payoffs than the
classical correlated equilibria is answered in the affirmative for the
Prisoner's Dilemma and Simplified Poker.

the largest (or smallest) possible slip in a straight, thin channel for
parallel (or perpendicular) orientation with respect to the mean flow. For
isotropic (e.g. chessboard or random) textures, the Hashin-Strikman conditions
further constrain the effective slip. These results provide a framework for the
