physics and biology has been applied to gain a more profound insight into
rheumatoid arthritis. As a result of the present investigation, this disease
could be viewed as due to a metabolic dysregulation/syndrome-associated
breakdown in the immunoglobulin A-based surveillance of the potentially
pathogenic fungus Candida albicans that subsequently engenders a widespread
self-destruction through cross-reactive auto-epitopes, ultimately amounting to
the systemic predominance of a pro-inflammatory peptide string. Its therapeutic
counterpart equally proposed in this report might serve as a model for future
strategies against autoimmunity.

observed population of young stars could have originated from a large angle
collision of two massive gaseous clouds at R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A*. In all the
simulations performed, the post-collision gas flow forms an inner nearly
circular gaseous disc and one or two eccentric outer filaments, consistent with
the observations. Furthermore, the radial stellar mass distribution is always
very steep, sigma proportional to R^-2, again consistent with the data. The 3D
velocity structure of the stellar distribution is however sensitive to initial
conditions (e.g., the impact parameter of the clouds) and gas cooling details.
In all the cases the amount of gas accreted by our inner boundary condition is
large, enough to allow Sgr A* to radiate near its Eddington limit during ~ 10^5
years. This suggests that a refined model would have physically larger clouds
(or a cloud and a disc such as the CND) colliding at a distance of a few pc

isolated red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6121

multi-population phenomenon recently discovered to affect some Globular
Clusters. METHODS. The data have been collected with FLAMES+UVES, at the
ESO/VLT@UT2 telescope. Analysis was performed under LTE approximation for the
following elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Ba, and NLTE
corrections were applied to Na and Mg. Spectroscopic data were coupled with
high-precision wide-field UBVI$_{\rm C}$ photometry from WFI@2.2m telescope and
infrared JHK photometry from 2MASS. RESULTS: We derived an average $\rm
{[Fe/H]}=-1.07\pm0.01$ (internal error), and an $\alpha$ enhancement of $\rm
{[\alpha/Fe]}=+0.39\pm0.05$ dex (internal error). We confirm the presence of an
extended Na-O anticorrelation, and find two distinct groups of stars with
significantly different Na and O content. We find no evidence of a Mg-Al
anticorrelation. By coupling our results with previous studies on the CN band
strength, we find that the CN strong stars have higher Na and Al content and
are more O depleted than the CN weak ones. The two groups of Na-rich, CN-strong
and Na-poor, CN-weak stars populate two different regions along the RGB. In the
$\rm {U}$ vs. $\rm {U-B}$ color magnitude diagram the RGB spread is present rom
the base of the RGB to the RGB-tip. Apparently, both spectroscopic and

these black holes accrete ambient matter at the Eddington limit shortly after
their production, thereby emitting Hawking radiation that would be harmful to
Earth and/or CERN and its surroundings, is described. Such black holes are
shown to remain undetectable in existing astrophysical observations and thus
evade a recent exclusion of risks from subnuclear black holes by Giddings &

plausible black-hole parameter ranges from safety consideration without giving
any reason. Some feasible operational measures at colliders are proposed that

periods. Tomographic imaging techniques allow us to reconstruct the surface
magnetic topologies from the rotationally modulated time-series of circularly
polarised profiles. We fnd that all stars host mainly axisymmetric large-scale
poloidal fields. Three stars were observed at two different epochs separated by
~1 yr; we find the magnetic topologies to be globally stable on this timescale.
  We also provide an accurate estimation of the rotational period of all stars,
thus allowing us to start studying how rotation impacts the large-scale
magnetic field.

percussion model of TBI shows that pressure impulses of 15-30 psi cause mild to
moderate TBI in laboratory animals. In pigs and dogs, bullet impacts to the
thigh produce pressure waves in the brain of 18-45 psi and measurable injury to

simpler its perturbation theory, but an increased understanding of the
structure of the S-matrix in gauge theories and gravity has been pointing to
the opposite conclusion. In this paper we suggest that N=8 SUGRA has the
simplest interacting S-matrix in 4D. Using Grassmann coherent states for
external particles shows that amplitudes with maximal SUSY are smooth objects,
with the action of SUSY manifest. We show that all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM
and N=8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can
thus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the
non-linearly realized E_{7(7)} symmetry of N=8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes.
We give a simple discussion of the structure of 1-loop amplitudes in any QFT,
in close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of
scalar ""triangle"" and ""bubble"" integrals are determined by the ""pole at
infinite momentum"" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell
superspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that
arise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and
bubbles at 1-loop. We also argue that rational terms are absent. This
establishes the recent conjecture that 1-loop amplitudes in N=8 SUGRA have only
scalar box integrals, just as N=4 SYM. It is natural to conjecture that with
maximal SUSY, amplitudes are completely determined by their leading
singularities even beyond tree- and 1-loop level; this would directly imply the
perturbative finiteness of N=8 SUGRA. The remarkable properties of scattering
amplitudes call for an explanation in terms of a ""weak-weak"" dual formulation
of QFT, a holographic dual of flat space.

large number of colors N and N_f\ll N at T\neq 0 and \mu\neq 0 is triggered by
the drastic change in \theta behavior. The conjecture is motivated by the
holographic model of QCD where confinement -deconfinement phase transition
indeed happens precisely at the value of temperature T=T_c where \theta
dependence experiences a sudden change in behavior[1]. The conjecture is also
supported by quantum field theory arguments when the instanton calculations
(which trigger the \theta dependence) are under complete theoretical control
for T>T_c, suddenly break down immediately below T<T_c with sharp changes in
the \theta dependence. Finally, the conjecture is supported by a number of
numerical lattice results. We employ this conjecture to study confinement
-deconfinement phase transition of dense QCD at large \mu in large N limit by
analyzing the \theta dependence. We find that the confinement- deconfinement
phase transition at N_f\ll N happens at very large quark chemical potential
\mu_c\sim \sqrt{N}\Lambda_{QCD}. This result agrees with recent findings by
McLerran and Pisarski[2]. We also speculate on case when N_f\sim N.

accident frequencies and severities. These models assume that there are two
unobserved states of roadway safety, and that roadway entities (e.g., roadway
segments) can switch between these states over time. The states are distinct,
in the sense that in the different states accident frequencies or severities
are generated by separate processes (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial,
multinomial logit). Bayesian inference methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations are used for estimation of Markov switching models. To
demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we conduct the following three
studies. In the first study, two-state Markov switching count data models are
considered as an alternative to zero-inflated models for annual accident
frequencies, in order to account for preponderance of zeros typically observed
in accident frequency data. In the second study, two-state Markov switching
Poisson model and two-state Markov switching negative binomial model are
estimated using weekly accident frequencies on selected Indiana interstate
highway segments over a five-year time period. In the third study, two-state
Markov switching multinomial logit models are estimated for severity outcomes
of accidents occurring on Indiana roads over a four-year time period. One of
the most important results found in each of the three studies, is that in each
case the estimated Markov switching models are strongly favored by roadway
safety data and result in a superior statistical fit, as compared to the
corresponding standard (non-switching) models.

DIB at 8620.4 Ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all DIBs occurring
within the RAVE wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorption
stellar lines in hot stars. It correlates so tightly with reddening that it
turns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation E(B-V) =
2.72 (+/- 0.03) x E.W.(Ang), valid throughout the general interstellar medium
of our Galaxy. The presence of a DIB at 8648 Ang is confirmed. Its intensity
appears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminary
reports available in the literature, and its measurability is strongly
compromised by severe blending with underlying stellar HeI doublet at 8649 Ang.
The two weak DIBS at 8531 and 8572 Ang do not appear real and should actually
be blends of underlying stellar lines. The very weak DIB at 8439 Ang cannot be
resolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen Paschen 18

evolution and the ionization history during the dark ages. This is reflected in
the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen, which is coupled to the gas temperature
through collisions at high redshifts, and through the Wouthuysen-Field effect
at low redshifts. We present a semi-analytic model for star formation and the
build-up of a Lyman alpha background in the presence of magnetic fields, and
calculate the evolution of the mean 21 cm brightness temperature and its
frequency gradient as a function of redshift. We further discuss the evolution
of linear fluctuations in temperature and ionization in the presence of
magnetic fields and calculate the effect on the 21 cm power spectrum. At high
redshifts, the signal is increased compared to the non-magnetic case due to the
additional heat input into the IGM from ambipolar diffusion and the decay of
MHD turbulence. At lower redshifts, the formation of luminous objects and the
build-up of a Lyman alpha background can be delayed by a redshift interval of
10 due to the strong increase of the filtering mass scale in the presence of
magnetic fields. This tends to decrease the 21 cm signal compared to the
zero-field case. In summary, we find that 21 cm observations may become a
promising tool to constrain primordial magnetic fields.

The main purposes of this paper are to show that if the injective envelope $E$
of the simple $R$-module has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the
Frobenius skew polynomial ring over $R$, then $R$ has a tight closure test
element (for modules) and is $F$-pure, and to relate the test ideal of $R$ to
the smallest '$E$-special' ideal of $R$ of positive height.
  A byproduct is an analogue of a result of Janet Cowden Vassilev: she showed,
in the case where $R$ is an $F$-pure homomorphic image of an $F$-finite regular
local ring, that there exists a strictly ascending chain $0 = \tau_0 \subset
\tau_1 \subset ... \subset \tau_t = R$ of radical ideals of $R$ such that, for
each $i = 0, ..., t-1$, the reduced local ring $R/\tau_i$ is $F$-pure and its
test ideal (has positive height and) is exactly $\tau_{i+1}/\tau_i$. This paper
presents an analogous result in the case where $R$ is complete (but not
necessarily $F$-finite) and $E$ has a structure as a torsion-free left module
over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring. Whereas Cowden Vassilev's results were
based on R. Fedder's criterion for $F$-purity, the arguments in this paper are
based on the author's work on graded annihilators of left modules over the
Frobenius skew polynomial ring.

of diameter $D$ grafted at a distance $L$ from the open end of the tube may
undergo a rather abrupt transition, where part of the chain escapes from the
tube to form a ""crown-like"" coil outside of the tube. When this problem is
studied by Monte Carlo simulation of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic
lattice applying a cylindrical confinement and using the standard
pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), one obtains spurious results,
however: with increasing chain length the transition gets weaker and weaker,
due to insufficient sampling of the ""escaped"" states, as a detailed analysis
shows. In order to solve this problem, a new variant of a biased sequential
sampling algorithm with re-sampling is proposed, force-biased PERM: the
difficulty of sampling both phases in the region of the first order transition
with the correct weights is treated by applying a force at the free end pulling
it out of the tube. Different strengths of this force need to be used and
reweighting techniques are applied. Using rather long chains (up to N=18000)
and wide tubes (up to D=29 lattice spacings), the free energy of the chain, its
end-to-end distance, the number of ""imprisoned"" monomers can be estimated, as
well as the order parameter and its distribution. It is suggested that this new
algorithm should be useful for other problems involving state changes of

two-dimensional electron systems show a similar behavior of these systems
regarding temperature and microwave frequency. It is found that these
oscillations tend to quench when frequency or temperature increase, approaching
magnetoresistance to the response of the dark system. In this work we show that
this experimental behavior can be addressed on the same theoretical basis.
Microwave radiation forces the electron orbits to move back and forth being
damped by interaction with the lattice. We show that this damping depends
dramatically on microwave frequency and also on temperature. An increase in
frequency or temperature gives rise to an increase in the lattice damping
producing eventually a quenching effect in the magnetoresistance oscillations.

scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to
the available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics
of c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic'
interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium
melting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found,
however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies;
the experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the
`hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the
purely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with
the data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC
energies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of
J/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of
non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic
interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi
rapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC
energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's
in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi
mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.
Throughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charm
observables from Au+Au collisions at FAIR energies of 25-35 AGeV.

from massive stars. Using a particle-injection method, we investigate the
effect of structure close to the wind sources and the short-timescale influence
of winds on protoclusters. Structures such as disks and gaseous filaments have
a strong collimating effect. By a different technique of injecting momentum
from point sources, we compare the large-scale, long-term effects of isotropic
and intrinsically-collimated winds and find them to be similar. Both types of
wind dramatically slow the global star formation process, but the timescale on
which they expel significant mass from the cluster is rather long (approaching
10 freefall times). Clusters may then experience rapid star formation early in
their lifetimes, before switching to a mode where gas is gradually expelled,
while star formation proceeds much more slowly. This complicates conclusions
regarding slow star formation derived from measuring the star-formation
efficiency per freefall time. Estimates of the efficacy of winds in dispersing
clusters derived simply from the total wind momentum flux may not be very
reliable. This is due to material being expelled from deep within stellar
potential wells, often to velocities well in excess of the cluster escape
velocity, and also to the loss of momentum flux through holes in the gas
distribution. Winds have little effect on the accretion--driven stellar IMF
except at the very high-mass end, where they serve to prevent some of the most
massive objects accreting. We also find that the morphology of the gas, the
rapid motions of the wind sources and the action of accretion flows prevent the
formation of bubble-like structures. This may make it difficult to discern the
influence of winds on very young clusters.

Minimal Walking Technicolor at the phase transition. Using the one-loop
effective potential with ring improvement, we identify significant regions of
parameter space which yield a sufficiently strong first order transition for
electroweak baryogenesis. The composite particle spectrum corresponding to
these regions can be produced and studied at the Large Hadron Collider
experiment. We note the possible emergence of a second phase transition at
lower temperatures. This occurs when the underlying technicolor theory
possesses a nontrivial center symmetry.

two BCGs, NGC6034 and NGC7768, indicating that it is unlikely that they formed
through dissipationless mergers. Velocity substructure in the form of
kinematically decoupled cores is detected in 12 galaxies, and we find five
galaxies with velocity dispersion increasing with radius. The amount of
rotation, the velocity substructure and the position of BCGs on the

half-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Ohms
impedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line
resonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a
cross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of
the cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the
relative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input
ports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the
microwave excitation at the center of the cross resonator. The third (output)
port is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low
temperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial lines mask the signal
reflected by the resonator. EPR spectra recorded at low temperature in an S=
5/2 molecular magnet system show that 82%-fidelity circular polarization of the
microwaves is achieved over the central area of the resonator.

OGLE and MOA at an increasing rate. Around ten percent of these events involve
binary lenses. Such events potentially contain much information on the physical
properties of the observed binary systems, which can then be used for e.g.
statistical studies on binary objects in the Galactic disk or bulge. However,
such events are usually not straightforward to study, because the model
equations are strongly non-linear and there are many local minima that can fool
the search for the best solution if the parameter space is not inspected with
great care. In this work an alternative parameterisation for the binary lens
fitting problem is proposed, in which the parameters involved are defined to
represent as closely as possible the caustic-crossing features observed in most
binary lens light curves. Furthermore, we work out an extension of the method
in order to make use of the straight line fold caustic approximation, when the
latter applies for both the caustic entry and exit. We introduce an alternative
parameterisation in order to confine the exploration of the parameter space to
regions where the models only involve caustic crossing at the dates seen in the
light curve. We find that the proposed parameterisation provides more
robustness to the light curve fitting process, in particular in avoiding a code
to get stuck in false minima.
