developed specifically for turbulence simulations. The like-particle collision
operator includes both pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and
satisfies the physical constraints required for collision operators: it
conserves particles, momentum and energy, obeys Boltzmann's H-theorem
(collisions cannot decrease entropy), vanishes on a Maxwellian, and efficiently
dissipates small-scale structure in the velocity space. The process of
transforming this collision operator into the gyroaveraged form for use in
gyrokinetic simulations is detailed. The gyroaveraged model operator is shown
to have more suitable behavior at small scales in phase space than previously
suggested models. A model operator for electron-ion collisions is also
presented.

give information on the system magnetic field and the location of the TeV

superior conjunction in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039, we compute the absorbed
luminosity that is caused by pair creation in the stellar photon field for
different emitter positions with respect to the star and the observer line of
sight. The role of the magnetic field and electromagnetic cascading are
discussed. For the case of inefficient electromagnetic cascading, the expected
secondary synchrotron fluxes are compared with the observed ones at X-ray
energies. We find that, in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039, either the magnetic field in
the star surroundings is much smaller than the one expected for O stars or the
TeV emitter is located at a distance >10^12 cm from the compact object. Our
results strongly suggest that the TeV emitters in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039 are
located at the borders of the binary system and well above the orbital plane.
This would not agree with those models for which the emitter is well inside the

the MuCap experiment determines the rate of muon capture on the proton, from
which the proton's pseudoscalar coupling g_p may be inferred. A precision of
15% for g_p has been published; this is a step along the way to a goal of 7%.
This coupling can be calculated precisely from heavy baryon chiral perturbation
theory and therefore permits a test of QCD's chiral symmetry. Meanwhile, the
MuSun experiment is in its final design stage; it will measure the rate of muon
capture on the deuteron using a similar technique. This process can be related
through pionless effective field theory and chiral perturbation theory to other
two-nucleon reactions of astrophysical interest, including proton-proton fusion
and deuteron breakup.

quantum information science. Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no
classical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable
resource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including
quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We
first investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled
states (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical
graphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to
graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be
characterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and
manipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose
codewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation
concerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to
carry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while
simultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that
transversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors
through a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost
all QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits
for creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to
harness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to
extract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state
using local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create
entangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the
input parameters.

minimizing the number of ""cut"" edges with an endpoint in each subset. When
considered over sparse random graphs, the phase structure of the graph
bisection problem displays certain familiar properties, but also some
surprises. It is known that when the mean degree is below the critical value of
2 log 2, the cutsize is zero with high probability. We study how the minimum
cutsize increases with mean degree above this critical threshold, finding a new
analytical upper bound that improves considerably upon previous bounds.
Combined with recent results on expander graphs, our bound suggests the unusual
scenario that random graph bisection is replica symmetric up to and beyond the
critical threshold, with a replica symmetry breaking transition possibly taking
place above the threshold. An intriguing algorithmic consequence is that
although the problem is NP-hard, we can find near-optimal cutsizes (whose ratio
to the optimal value approaches 1 asymptotically) in polynomial time for
typical instances near the phase transition.

NUV - r < 5.4, are potential star-forming candidates. Considering the

continuum, and scattered nuclear light), there are 6 remaining star-forming
""blue"" galaxies.
  We then divide the radio galaxies, on the basis of the radio morphology,
radio power, and diagnostic optical line ratios, into low and high excitation
galaxies, LEG and HEG. While there is no correlation between the FR type (or
radio power) and color, the FR type is clearly related to the spectroscopic
type. In fact, all HEG (with one possible exception) show morphological
evidence of recent star formation in UV compact knots, extended over 5-20 kpc.

FR I galaxies.
  The picture that emerges, considering color, UV, optical, and dust
morphology, is that only in HEG recent star formation is associated with these
relatively powerful AGN, which are most likely triggered by a recent, major,
wet merger. Conversely, in LEG galaxies the fraction of actively star-forming
objects is not enhanced with respect to quiescent galaxies. The AGN activity in

function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this
mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts;
however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure the

Systematic trends in the bond length and dynamical properties can be explained
largely on arguments based on local coordination and elemental environment.
Thus increase in the number of silver atoms in a given neighborhood introduces
a monotonic increase in bond length while increase of the copper content does
the reverse. Moreover, based on bond lengths of the lowest coordinated (6 and
8) copper atoms with their nearest neighbors (Cu atoms), we find that the
nanoparticles divide into two groups with average bond length either close to
(~ 2.58 A) or smaller (~ 2.48 A) than that in bulk copper, accompanied by
characteristic features in their vibrational density of states. For the entire
set of nanoparticles, vibrational modes are found above the bulk bands of
copper/silver. Furthermore, a blue shift in the high frequency end with
increasing number of copper atoms in the nanoparticles is traced to a shrinkage
of bond lengths from bulk values. The vibrational densities of states at the
low frequency end of the spectrum scale linearly with frequency as for single
element nanoparticles, however, the effect is more pronounced for these
nanoalloys. The Debye temperature was found to be about one third of that of
the bulk for pure copper and silver nanoparticles with a non-linear increase
with increasing number of copper atoms in the nanoalloys.

Darlington, 1980; Thomas, 1985, Iyengar & Greenhouse, 1988), Scargle showed, by
way of a simple 2-parameter model, how far off Rosenthal & Rubin' s estimate

ratio of unpublished to published papers is large only in a tiny region of the

organization and processes. Specifically, we regard species to be networks of
organisms integrated by reproductive mechanisms (e.g., conjugation, meiosis,
syngamy) regardless of degree or type of divergence, longevity, size, fate, or
other criteria. Ramifications of viewing units of diversity in terms of
inherent organization include the following: (1) Species, subspecies,
population, deme, Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), and related terms cannot
be distinguished on the basis of inherent organization and, consequently, do
not reflect a hierarchy of organization. In other words, only one model is
required to explain systems composed of organisms. (2) Temporarily isolated
networks of organisms possess the same intrinsic organization and, therefore,
the same ontological status as permanently isolated systems. (3) Units of
diversity are recognized regardless of kind or degree of divergence. (4) Fate
is not an intrinsic property of systems and is an inappropriate consideration
in species models. (5) Networks are recognized at the moment they become
isolated; therefore, resultant classifications reflect the causal events that
generate diversity (e.g., vicariance) rather than post-vicariance events such
as character evolution and, consequently, have greater historical relevance
(e.g., biogeography). (6) Because the proposed model is based on organization,
it is similar to models in other disciplines (e.g., astronomy, chemistry, and
physics) and should lead to greater unification of thought within biology and
among scientific disciplines. (7) Lineage concepts are problematic because they
do not describe a unique level of biological organization and because
ancestor-descendant relationships are not unique to living systems.

giant lobes and to search for spectral changes as a function of position along
the lobes. We show that the high-frequency radio spectra of the northern and
southern giant lobes are significantly different: the spectrum of the southern
lobe steepens monotonically (and is steeper further from the active nucleus)
whereas the spectrum of the northern lobe remains consistent with a power law.
The inferred differences in the northern and southern giant lobes may be the
result of real differences in their high-energy particle acceleration
histories, perhaps due to the influence of the northern middle lobe, an
intermediate-scale feature which has no detectable southern counterpart. In
light of these results, we discuss the prospects for Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope detections of inverse-Compton emission from the giant lobes and the
lobes' possible role in the production of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays
(UHECR) detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show that the possibility
of a Fermi detection depends sensitively on the physical conditions in the
giant lobes, with the northern lobe more likely to be detected, and that any
emission observed by Fermi is likely to be dominated by photons at the soft end
of the Fermi energy band. On the other hand we argue that the estimated
conditions in the giant lobes imply that UHECRs can be accelerated there, with
a potentially detectable gamma-ray signature at TeV energies.

algorithm that is applicable to a network with any degree distribution. The
partition of a network suggested by this algorithm also applies to its
complementary network. In general, groups of similar components are not
necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus
partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional
information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used
for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By
introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the
heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can
be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an
interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community

Dirac Fermions. In realistic devices, however, the electronic properties are
modified by elastic deformations, interlayer coupling and substrate
interaction. Here we unravel the electronic structure of doped graphene,
revisiting the stage one graphite intercalation compound KC$_8$ using
angle--resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab--initio calculations. The
full experimental dispersion is in excellent agreement to calculations of doped
graphene once electron correlations are included on the $GW$ level. This
highlights that KC$_8$ has negligible interlayer coupling. Therefore Dirac
Fermion behaviour is preserved and we directly determine the full experimental
Dirac cone of doped graphene. In addition we prove that superconductivity in
KC$_8$ is mediated by electron--phonon coupling to an iTO phonon, yielding a
strong kink in the quasiparticle dispersion at 166 meV. These results are key
for understanding, both, the unique electronic properties of graphene and
superconductivity in KC$_8$.

electron and hole states with equal momentum. This coupling opens a gap at the
Fermi level. In a realistic sample, however, it is unlikely that this
instability could be observed in its pure form. Namely, since chemical
properties of the dangling carbon atoms are different from chemical properties
of the atoms inside the sample (for example, the atoms at the edge have only
two neighbours, besides additional non-carbon atoms might be attached to
passivate unpaired covalent carbon bonds), it is very probable that the bonds
at the edge are deformed due to chemical interactions. This chemically-induced
modification of the nanoribbon's edges can be viewed as an effective field
biasing our predicted instability in a particular direction. Yet by disordering
this field (e.g., through random substitution of the radicals attached to the
edges) we may tune the system back to the critical regime and vary the
electronic properties of the system. For example, we show that electrical
transport through a nanoribbon is strongly affected by such disorder.

  The vortex model of elementary particles","11 pages with 1 table",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Dirac equation describes the motion of electrons in electromagnetic
field, but it considers spin as intrinsic property without any real motion. We
postulate spin as the intrinsic feature of vacuum, in which the incident
electromagnetic radiation can create vortices with well defined spinning
frequency and completely undefined axis of rotation. The vortices have finite
surface determined by the spinning frequency that makes the peripheral speed
equal to the velocity of light. According to the Lorentz equations of special
relativity, the product of radius and mass of rotating objects is independent
of the frequency of rotation and it is equal to 3/4h/2pic for all fermions.
This invariance explains how the light with infinite spatial dimension and zero
mass can produce finite mass and size for the particles in the pair-creation
processes. The vortex model interprets the rest energy as the kinetic energy of
spinning motion. The isotropic character of spinning can be represented by
helical motion with right or left-handed chirality corresponding to the duality
of matter and anti-matter. Conservation rule is proposed for the chirality
explaining the electron-positron annihilation and the pair-creation processes.
The vortex induced field rotation around the particle can reproduce the
gravitational formula if the curvature of field is derived from the Lorentz
contraction on the surface of rotating sphere. Generalized Hamiltonian is
suggested for the fermions describing the spinning motion in the internal frame
of particles, it reproduces the Dirac equation, when the rest energy is
predominant.

  superoperators and comparison of the existing models",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time development of electromagnetic fields in closed cavities under
continuous detection of photons continues to be a subject of confusing
controversy. Recently Dodonov et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 75, 013806, 2007] argued
that their model of quantum superoperators (E model) invalidates some of the
predictions of the previously introduced photon counting model of Srinivas and
Davies [J. Mod. Optic. 28, 981, 1981] (SD model). Both the SD and the E models
are based on two postulated quantum jump superoperators: (1) the one-count
operator corresponding to the absorption of a single photon and (2) the
no-count operator. In this work we develop a stochastic difference equation
that describes the dissipative coupling of the cavity field and the detector.
The difference equation is based on non-perturbative treatment of the
cavity-detector coupling. In spite of being non-integrable due to the coupling
of the detector with an external reservoir it can be used to derive the exact
forms of the quantum jump superoperators. When applied to a particular photon
counting measurement our theory gives predictions identical with those of the
SD model which should be considered a non-perturbative and ab-initio result. It
is pointed out that available experimental results coincide with the results
given by the ab-initio SD model. We summarize some of the key characteristics
of cavity fields and photon counting processes to demonstrate that the results
given by the SD model are consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics
while those given by the E model are not.

the value of a weight parameter s determining the relative influence of the

as a subobject of the labelled coskeleton, the latter coinciding in the

of the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above

projections in the multiplier algebra of the dual discrete quantum group. This
allows to deduce that every idempotent state on a finite quantum group arises
in a canonical way as the Haar state on a finite quantum hypergroup. A natural
order structure on the set of idempotent states is also studied and some
examples discussed.

bureaucratic inefficiency in a quantifiable and dynamical socio-physical
framework. In the first model we show how the use of recent opinion formation
models for small groups can be used to understand Parkinson's observation that
decision making bodies such as cabinets or boards become highly inefficient
once their size exceeds a critical 'Coefficient of Inefficiency', typically
around 20. A second observation of Parkinson - which is sometimes referred to
as Parkinson's Law - is that the growth of bureaucratic or administrative
bodies usually goes hand in hand with a drastic decrease of its overall
efficiency. In our second model we view a bureaucratic body as a system of a
flow of workers, which enter, become promoted to various internal levels within
the system over time, and leave the system after having served for a certain
time. Promotion usually is associated with an increase of subordinates. Within
the proposed model it becomes possible to work out the phase diagram under
which conditions bureaucratic growth can be confined. In our last model we
assign individual efficiency curves to workers throughout their life in
administration, and compute the optimum time to send them to old age pension,
in order to ensure a maximum of efficiency within the body - in Parkinson's
words we compute the 'Pension Point'.

study the effect of electron interaction on nuclear magnetism in one dimension.
If the electrons are in the metallic, Luttinger liquid regime, we show that
even a very weak hyperfine coupling to the 13-C nuclear spins has a striking
effect: The system is driven into an ordered phase, which combines electron and
nuclear degrees of freedom, and which persists up into the millikelvin range.
In this phase the conductance is reduced by a universal factor of 2, allowing
for detection by standard transport experiments.

One can place this in a wider setting as an example of a coloured poset, that
is to say a poset with a unique maximal element equipped with a presheaf of
modules. In this paper we initiate the study of a bundle theory for coloured
posets, producing for a certain class of base posets a Leray-Serre type
spectral sequence. We then show how this theory finds application in Khovanov
homology by producing a new spectral sequence converging to the Khovanov
homology of a given link.
