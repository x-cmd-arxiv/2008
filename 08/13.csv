local GUT models based on F-theory 7-branes and demonstrate that a mechanism
for solving both the \mu and \mu/B_{\mu} problems emerges in a natural way. In
particular, a straightforward coupling of the messengers to the Higgs sector
leads to a geometry which not only provides us with an approximate U(1)_{PQ}
symmetry that forbids the generation of \mu at the GUT scale, it also forces
the SUSY-breaking spurion field to carry a nontrivial PQ charge. This connects
the breaking of SUSY to the generation of \mu so that the same scale enters
both. Moreover, the messenger sector naturally realizes the D3-instanton
triggered Polonyi model of arXiv:0808.1286 so this scale is exponentially
suppressed relative to M_{GUT}. The effective action at low scales is in fact
precisely of the form of the ""sweet spot supersymmetry"" scenario studied by Ibe
and Kitano in arXiv:0705.3686.

Bino like and annihilation on the Hyperbolic Branch (HB) where the neutralino
has a significant Higgsino component. An investigation of how one may
discriminate between the Stau-Co region and the HB region using LHC data is
given for the mSUGRA model. The analysis utilizes several signatures including
multi leptons, hadronic jets, b-tagging, and missing transverse momentum. A
study of the SUSY signatures reveals several correlated smoking gun signals
allowing a clear discrimination between the Stau-Co and the HB regions where
dark matter in the early universe can originate.

  conference. The current version contains improved results and simpler
  algorithms",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Algorithmic pricing is the computational problem that sellers (e.g., in
supermarkets) face when trying to set prices for their items to maximize their
profit in the presence of a known demand. Guruswami et al. (2005) propose this
problem and give logarithmic approximations (in the number of consumers) when
each consumer's values for bundles are known precisely. Subsequently several
versions of the problem have been shown to have poly-logarithmic
inapproximability. This problem has direct ties to the important open question
of better understanding the Bayesian optimal mechanism in multi-parameter
settings; however, logarithmic approximations are inadequate for this purpose.
It is therefore of vital interest to consider special cases where constant
approximations are possible. We consider the unit-demand variant of this
problem. Here a consumer has a valuation for each different item and their
value for a set of items is simply the maximum value they have for any item in
the set. We assume that the preferences of the consumers are drawn from a
distribution, the standard assumption in economics; furthermore, the setting of
a specific set of customers with known preferences, which is employed in all
prior work in algorithmic pricing, is a special case of this general problem,
where there is a discrete Bayesian distribution for preferences specified by
picking one consumer uniformly from the given set of consumers. Our work
complements these existing works by considering the case where the consumer's
valuations for the different items are independent random variables. Our main
result is a constant approximation that makes use of an interesting connection
between this problem and the concept of virtual valuations from the
single-parameter Bayesian optimal mechanism design literature.

field-like theory replaces the rigid constraints of confinement with average

efficacy of the theory is established by reproducing the exact correlation
functions for a WLC confined to the surface of a sphere. In addition, the
coefficients in the free energy are exactly calculated. We also describe the
behavior of a surface-confined chain under external tension that is relevant
for single molecule experiments on histone-DNA complexes. The force-extension
curves display spatial oscillations, and the extension of the chain, whose
maximum value is bounded by the sphere diameter, scales as $f^{-1}$ at large
forces, in contrast to the unconfined chain that approaches the contour length
as $f^{-1/2}$. A WLC encapsulated in a sphere, that is relevant for the study
of the viral encapsulation of DNA, can also be treated using the MF approach.
The predictions of the theory for various correlation functions are in
excellent agreement with Langevin simulations. We find that strongly confined
chains are highly structured by examining the correlations using a local
winding axis. The predicted pressure of the system is in excellent agreement
with simulations but, as is known, is significantly lower than the pressures
seen for DNA packaged in viral capsids.

disk and outer emission filaments, are found within the optical radius of the
galaxy. The first subsystem, at galactocentric distances r<3.5 kpc, rotates in
the plane of the stellar disk. The inner part of the ionized-gas disk (r<1.5-2
kpc) exactly coincides with the previously known disk consisting of molecular
gas. The second subsystem of ionized gas is located at galactocentric distances
2-6 kpc. This subsystem rotates in a plane tilted by a significant angle to the
stellar disk. The angle of orbital inclination in the outer disk increases with
galactocentric distance and reaches 50 degrees at r=6 kpc. The ionized fraction
of the gaseous disk does not show up beyond this galactocentric distance, but
we believe that the HI disk continues to warp and approaches the plane that is
polar with respect to the inner disk of the galaxy. Hence Arp 212 can be
classified as a galaxy with a polar ring (or a polar disk). The observed

Rayleigh wave softening detected by helium atom scattering (HAS) experiments to
changes in the force constants between the substrate surface atoms brought
about by CO chemisorption, resolving an ongoing debate on the subject. The
calculated surface phonon dispersion curves document the changes in the
polarization of some modes and show those of the modes originally along the
$\bar{Y}$ direction of the clean surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) which are
back-folded along the $\bar{\Delta}$ direction of the chemisorbed SBZ, to be
particularly consequential. The vertical and shear horizontal section of $S_1$

longitudinal-vertical mode, indicating thereby that $S_1$ $-$ predicted a long
time back along $\bar{\Delta}$ for the clean surface $-$ may be indirectly
assessed at $\bar{X}$ upon CO adsorption by standard planar scattering
techniques. These findings further suggest that some of the energy losses
detected by HAS along $\bar{\Delta}$, which were associated to multiphonon
excitations of the adlayer frustrated translation mode, may actually correspond
to the back-folded substrate surface modes.

sufficient number of massless fields, using numerical simulations. Neglecting
Hawking radiation, the inner horizon is a null Cauchy horizon and a curvature
singularity due to mass inflation. When we include Hawking radiation, the inner
horizon becomes space-like and is separated from the Cauchy horizon, which is
parallel to the out-going null direction. Since a charged black hole must
eventually transit to a neutral black hole, we studied the neutralization of
the black hole and observed that the inner horizon evolves into a space-like
singularity, generating a Cauchy horizon which is parallel to the in-going null
direction. Since the mass function is finite around the inner horizon, the
inner horizon is regular and penetrable in a general relativistic sense.
However, since the curvature functions become trans-Planckian, we cannot
saymore about the region beyond the inner horizon, and it is natural to say
that there is a 'physical' space-like singularity. However, if we assume an
exponentially large number of massless scalar fields, our results can be
extended beyond the inner horizon. In this case, strong cosmic censorship and
black hole complementarity can be violated.

Submitted",,,,"q-fin.ST q-fin.PM stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical arbitrage strategies, such as pairs trading and its
generalizations, rely on the construction of mean-reverting spreads enjoying a
certain degree of predictability. Gaussian linear state-space processes have
recently been proposed as a model for such spreads under the assumption that
the observed process is a noisy realization of some hidden states. Real-time
estimation of the unobserved spread process can reveal temporary market
inefficiencies which can then be exploited to generate excess returns. Building
on previous work, we embrace the state-space framework for modeling spread
processes and extend this methodology along three different directions. First,
we introduce time-dependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick
adaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an
on-line estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being
computationally fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building
aggressive trading strategies based on high-frequency data and may be used as a
monitoring device for mean-reversion. Finally, our framework naturally provides
informative uncertainty measures of all the estimated parameters. Experimental
results based on Monte Carlo simulations and historical equity data are
discussed, including a co-integration relationship involving two
exchange-traded funds.

convection to drive a strong differential rotation and achieve complex magnetic
dynamo action. Our sun must have rotated more rapidly in its past, as is
suggested by observations of many rapidly rotating young solar-type stars. Here
we explore the effects of more rapid rotation on the global-scale patterns of
convection in such stars and the flows of differential rotation and meridional
circulation which are self-consistently established. The convection in these
systems is richly time dependent and in our most rapidly rotating suns a
striking pattern of localized convection emerges. Convection near the equator
in these systems is dominated by one or two nests in longitude of locally
enhanced convection, with quiescent streaming flow in between at the highest
rotation rates. These active nests of convection maintain a strong differential
rotation despite their small size. The structure of differential rotation is
similar in all of our more rapidly rotating suns, with fast equators and slower
poles. We find that the total shear in differential rotation Delta Omega grows
with more rapid rotation while the relative shear Delta Omega/Omega_0
decreases. In contrast, at more rapid rotation the meridional circulations
decrease in energy and peak velocities and break into multiple cells of
circulation in both radius and latitude.

mildly relativistic jets or outflows, even in the absence of gamma-ray bursts.
Here we consider radiation from charged particles accelerated in such mildly
relativistic outflows with kinetic energies of ~10^{50} erg. The radiation
processes of the primarily accelerated electrons considered are synchrotron
radiation and inverse-Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (synchrotron
self-Compton; SSC) and of supernova photons (external inverse-Compton; EIC). In
the soft X-ray regime, both the SSC and EIC flux can be the dominant component,
but due to their very different spectral shapes it should be easy to
distinguish between them. When the fraction of the kinetic energy going into
the electrons (\epsilon_e) is large, the SSC is expected to be important;
otherwise the EIC will dominate. The EIC flux is quite high, almost
independently of \epsilon_e, providing a good target for X-ray telescopes such
as XMM-Newton and Chandra. In the GeV gamma-ray regime, the EIC would be the
dominant radiation process and the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)
should be able to probe the value of \epsilon_e, the spectrum of the electrons,
and their maximum acceleration energy. Accelerated protons also lead to photon
radiation through the secondary electrons produced by the photopion and
photopair processes. We find that over a significant range of parameters the
proton component is generally less prominent than the primary electron
component. We discuss the prospects for the detection of the X-ray and GeV
signatures of the mildly relativistic outflow of hypernovae.

our sample of evolved, variable stars have periodic light curves. We
characterize the stars in our sample using the multiple periods found in their
frequency spectra. Additionally, we use single-epoch Two Micron All Sky Survey
measurements to construct the average infrared light curves for different
groups of these stars. Comparison with evolutionary models shows that stars on
the red giant branch (RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) often
show non-periodic variability, but begin to pulsate with periods on the two
shortest period-luminosity sequences (3 & 4) when they brighten to K_s ~ 13.
The stars on the thermally pulsing AGB are more likely to pulsate with longer
periods that lie on the next two P-L sequences (1 & 2), including the sequence
associated with the Miras in the LMC. The Petersen diagram and its variants
show that multi-periodic stars on each pair of these sequences (3 & 4, and 1 &
2) typically pulsate with periods associated only with that pair. The periods
in these multi-periodic stars become longer and stronger as the star evolves.
We further constrain the mechanism behind the long secondary periods (LSPs)
seen in half of our sample, and find that there is a close match between the
luminosity functions of the LSP stars and all of the stars in our sample, and
that these star's pulsation amplitudes are relatively wavelength independent.
Although this is characteristic of stellar multiplicity, the large number of
these variables is problematic for that explanation.

Furthermore, time-resolving the signal we see clear beats when the Rabi

coupled dynamics, including memory effects and quantum interference in the

cluster lens SDSS J1004+4112 with the Subaru telescope. A secure detection of
an emission line of the faint blue stellar object (component E) near the center
of the brightest cluster galaxy (G1) confirms that it is the central fifth
image of the lensed quasar system. In addition, we measure the stellar velocity
dispersion of G1 to be sigma_* = 352+-13 km/s. We combine these results to
obtain constraints on the mass M_BH of the putative black hole (BH) at the
center of the inactive galaxy G1, and hence on the M_BH-sigma_* relation at the
lens redshift z_l=0.68. From detailed mass modeling, we place an upper limit on
the black hole mass, M_BH < 2.1x10^{10}M_sun at 1-sigma level
(<3.1x10^{10}M_sun at 3-sigma), which is consistent with black hole masses
expected from the local and redshift-evolved M_BH-sigma_* relations,

  Compressed Counting",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed Counting (CC)} was recently proposed for approximating the
$\alpha$th frequency moments of data streams, for $0<\alpha \leq 2$. Under the
relaxed strict-Turnstile model, CC dramatically improves the standard algorithm
based on symmetric stable random projections}, especially as $\alpha\to 1$. A
direct application of CC is to estimate the entropy, which is an important
summary statistic in Web/network measurement and often serves a crucial
""feature"" for data mining. The R\'enyi entropy and the Tsallis entropy are
functions of the $\alpha$th frequency moments; and both approach the Shannon
entropy as $\alpha\to 1$. A recent theoretical work suggested using the
$\alpha$th frequency moment to approximate the Shannon entropy with
$\alpha=1+\delta$ and very small $|\delta|$ (e.g., $<10^{-4}$).
  In this study, we experiment using CC to estimate frequency moments, R\'enyi
entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Shannon entropy, on real Web crawl data. We
demonstrate the variance-bias trade-off in estimating Shannon entropy and
provide practical recommendations. In particular, our experiments enable us to
draw some important conclusions:
  (1) As $\alpha\to 1$, CC dramatically improves {\em symmetric stable random
projections} in estimating frequency moments, R\'enyi entropy, Tsallis entropy,
and Shannon entropy. The improvements appear to approach ""infinity.""
  (2) Using {\em symmetric stable random projections} and $\alpha = 1+\delta$
with very small $|\delta|$ does not provide a practical algorithm because the
required sample size is enormous.

These spanners were implicitly studied in access control, data structures, and

  We initiate the study of approximability of the size of the sparsest
k-TC-spanner for a given directed graph. We completely resolve the
approximability of 2-TC-spanners, showing that it is Theta(log n) unless P =
NP. For k>2, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a k-TC-spanner

techniques also yield algorithms with the best-known approximation ratio for
well-studied problems on directed spanners when k>3: DIRECTED k-SPANNER,

objects contain at least one ""old"" stellar population (>1-10 Gyr) and one
""young"" population (<30 Myr) with the recent SF bursts occurring a few to a few
10s of Myr ago, arguing for synchronicity in star formation in these objects.
We propose that the ~synchronous star formation in all objects is caused by the
accretion of cold gas from intergalactic space onto dark matter haloes arranged
along a filament threading the void where these dwarf galaxies reside and point
out this galaxy sample as an ideal target to study hierarchical clustering and
galaxy formation among very nearby objects.

The mean Ne/O remains flat from the most active stars down to at least
intermediate activity levels (-5L_X/L_bol<-2), with some evidence for a decline
toward the lowest activity levels sampled. The abundances surveyed are all
based on emission measure distribution analyses and the mean Ne/O is about 0.1
dex lower than that found from line ratios in the seminal study of mostly
active stars by Drake & Testa (2005), but is within the systematic
uncertainties of that study. We also confirm a pattern of strongly decreasing
Fe/O with increasing stellar activity. The observed abundance patterns are
reminiscent of the recent finding of a dependence of the solar Ne/O and Fe/O
ratios on active region plasma temperature and indicate a universal
fractionation process is at work. The firm saturation in stellar Ne/O at higher
activity levels combined with variability in the solar coronal Ne/O leads us to
suggest that Ne is generally depleted in the solar outer atmosphere and
photospheric values are reflected in active stellar coronae. The solution to
the recent solar model problem would then appear to lie in a combination of the
Asplund et al O abundance downward revision being too large, and the Ne
abundance being underestimated for the Sun by about a factor of 2.

In purely quantum cases, the wavefunction of the JBA is trapped in a
quasienergy-state, and bifurcation is impossible. Introducing decoherence
enables us to reproduce the bifurcation with a finite hysteresis. Moreover, we
discuss in detail the dynamics involved when a qubit is initially in a
superposition state. We have observed the qubit-probe (JBA) entangled state and
it is divided into two separable states at the moment of the JBA transition
begins. This corresponds to ""projection"". To readout the measurement result,
however, we must wait until the two JBA states are macroscopically well
separated. The waiting time is determined by the strength of the decoherence in
the JBA.

in the cosmological fits, this would modify the \chi^2 by an amount of order
unity. We also find that the signal should be visible in the bispectrum
coefficients with a signal-to-noise S/N ~ O (1-10), localized at 10 < l < 40.
Such a signal would lead to an overestimation of the primordial f_{NL} by an
amount \Delta f_{NL} ~ 1 for WMAP and by \Delta f_{NL} ~ 0.1 for Planck.

identify a late O type star, having large (H-K) color, to be near the centre of
the CO jets observed by earlier authors. The UKIRT images reveal in IRAS
21407+5441, a faint but clear compact HII region around a central high -
intermediate mass star cluster. We have detected a number of sources with large
(H-K) color which are not detected in J band. We also present the GMRT radio
continuum map at 1.28 GHz covering the entire region surrounding the two star
forming clouds. The radio continuum fluxes are used to estimate the properties
of HII regions which seem to support our near-IR photometric results. Based on
our radio continuum map and the archival MSX 8.2 $\mu$m image, we show that the
two IRAS sources likely belong to the same parent molecular cloud and
conjecture that a high mass star of large IR colors, present in between the two
sources, might have triggered star formation in this region. However one can
not rule out the alternative possibility that Star A could be a nearby
foreground star.

simplicial complex is Cohen-Macaulay. Another notion familiar to commutative
algebraists, but which has not received as much attention from
combinatorialists as the Cohen-Macaulay property, is the notion of a Golod
ring. Recently, a criterion on simplicial complexes reminiscent of
shellability, called the strong gcd-condition, was shown to imply Golodness of
the associated Stanley-Reisner ring. The two algebraic notions were tied
together by Herzog, Reiner and Welker who showed that if the Alexander dual of
a complex is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay then the complex itself is Golod. In
this paper, we present a combinatorial companion of this result, namely that if
the Alexander dual of a complex is (non-pure) shellable then the complex itself
satisfies the strong gcd-condition. Moreover, we show that all implications
just mentioned are strict in general but that they are equivalences for flag
complexes.

end of the energy range of the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), as
a result of cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Hadronic processes are considered as the source of $\gamma$-ray photons from
localized molecular enhancements nearby accelerators. Two particular cases are
presented: a) the possibility of detecting spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
with maxima above 1 GeV, which may be constrained by detection or non-detection
at very-high energies (VHE) with observations by ground-based Cerenkov
telescopes, and b) the possibility of detecting V-shaped, inverted spectra, due
to confusion of a nearby (to the line of sight) arrangement of
accelerator/target scenarios with different characteristic properties. We show
that the finding of these signatures (in particular, a peak at the 1--100 GeV
energy region) is indicative for an identification of the underlying mechanism

to integrations of massless collisionless particles initially in nearly
circular orbits. Particles are perturbed by a quadrupolar gravitational
potential corresponding to a growing and secularly evolving bar. We find that
outer rings with R1R2 morphology and pseudorings are exhibited by the
simulations even though they lack gaseous dissipation. Simulations with
stronger bars form pseudorings earlier and more quickly than those with weaker
bars. We find that the R1 ring, perpendicular to the bar, is fragile and
dissolves after a few bar rotation periods if the bar pattern speed increases
by more than ~ 8%, bar strength increases (by >~ 140%) after bar growth, or the
bar is too strong (Q_T>0.3). If the bar slows down after formation, pseudoring
morphology persists and the R2 ring perpendicular to the bar is populated due
to resonance capture. The R2 ring remains misaligned with the bar and increases
in ellipticity as the bar slows down. The R2 ring becomes scalloped and does
not resemble any ringed galaxies if the bar slows down more than 3.5%
suggesting that bars decrease in strength before they slow down this much. We
compare the morphology of our simulations to B-band images of 9 ringed galaxies
from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey, and we find a
reasonable match in morphologies to R1R2' pseudorings seen within a few bar
rotation periods of bar formation. Some of the features previously interpreted
in terms of dissipative models may be due to transient structure associated
with recent bar growth and evolution.
