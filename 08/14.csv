estimate that is dependent on the local peculiar motion - giving a distorted
view of the three dimensional structure and affecting basic observables such as
the correlation function and power spectrum. We calculate the full non-linear
redshift-space power spectrum for Gaussian fields, giving results for both the
standard flat sky approximation and the directly-observable angular correlation
function and angular power spectrum. Coupling between large and small scale
modes boosts the power on small scales when the perturbations are small. On
larger scales power is slightly suppressed by the velocities perturbations on
smaller scales. The analysis is general, but we comment specifically on the
implications for future high-redshift observations, and show that the
non-linear spectrum has significantly more complicated angular structure than
in linear theory. We comment on the implications for using the angular
structure to separate cosmological and astrophysical components of 21 cm
observations.

result of how star formation takes place in DM halos, and thus are used to
constrain how UV light depends on halo properties such as mass. The two
measures were taken from the GOODS data, thus ideal for joint analysis. The two
physical quantities we explore are the SF duty cycle, and the range of L_UV
that a halo of mass M can have (mean and variance). The former addresses the
typical duration of SF activity in halos while the latter addresses the
averaged SF history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. We explore
various physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) the
typical duration of SF observed in the data is <0.4 Gyr (1 sig), 2) the
inferred scaling law between L_UV and halo mass M from the observed slope of
the LFs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) L_UV for a fixed halo mass
decreases with time, implying that the SF efficiency (after dust extinction) is
higher at earlier times. We explore several physical scenarios relating star
formation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable due
to the limited range of halo mass probed by our data. In order to discriminate
between different scenarios, we discuss constraining the bright-faint galaxy
cross-correlation functions and luminosity-dependence of galaxy bias.

Similar effects have been seen in systems without traps, raising the question
of how important the role of the trap is in these experiments. In this paper we
present results for both trapped conditions and resonant, non-trapped
conditions in the same sample. We find that the results are qualitatively
different, with two distinct types of transitions. At low density in the trap,
the polaritons remain in the strong-coupling regime while going through the

threshold behavior which occurs with weak coupling and can be identified with
lasing; this transition occurs both with and without a trap.

thermal history and physical aging in polymer glasses, in particular the
effects of a temperature square step. Measurements of two-time correlation
functions show that a negative temperature step causes ""rejuvenation"" of the
sample: the entire spectrum of relaxation times appears identical to a younger
specimen that did not experience a temperature step. A positive temperature
step, however, leads to significant changes in the relaxation times. At short
times, the dynamics are accelerated (rejuvenation), whereas at long times the
dynamics are slowed (over-aging). All findings are in excellent qualitative
agreement with recent experiments. The two regimes can be explained by the
competing contributions of dynamical heterogeneities and faster aging dynamics
at higher temperatures. As a result of this competition, the transition between
rejuvenation and over-aging depends on the length of the square step, with
shorter steps causing more rejuvenation and longer steps causing more
over-aging. Although the spectrum of relaxation times is greatly modified by a
temperature step, the van Hove functions, which measure the distribution of
particle displacements, exhibit complete superposition at times when the
mean-squared displacements are equal.

the fundamental three-term formula
q(G)=q(G-a)+q(G^{ab}-b)+((x-1)^{2}-1)q(G^{ab}-a-b) that lacks the last term. It
follows that interlace polynomial computations can be represented by binary
trees rather than mixed binary-ternary trees. Binary computation trees provide
a description of $q(G)$ that is analogous to the activities description of the
Tutte polynomial. If $G$ is a tree or forest then these ""algorithmic

other novel properties are weighted pendant-twin reductions, which involve
removing certain kinds of vertices from a graph and adjusting the weights of
the remaining vertices in such a way that the interlace polynomials are
unchanged. These reductions allow for smaller computation trees as they
eliminate some branches. If a graph can be completely analyzed using
pendant-twin reductions then its interlace polynomial can be calculated in
polynomial time. An intuitively pleasing property is that graphs which can be
constructed through graph substitutions have vertex-weighted interlace

seen through large amounts of gas and dust. We present Spitzer spectra of
twelve type 2 quasars selected on the basis of their optical emission line
properties. Within this sample, we find a surprising diversity of spectra, from
those that are featureless to those showing strong PAH emission, deep silicate
absorption at 10 micron, hydrocarbon absorption, high-ionization emission lines
and H_2 rotational emission lines. About half of the objects in the sample are
likely Compton-thick, including the two with the deepest Si absorption. The
median star-formation luminosity of the objects in our sample measured from the
strength of the PAH features is 5x10^11 L_sun, much higher than for field
galaxies or for any other AGN sample, but similar to other samples of type 2
quasars. This suggests an evolutionary link between obscured quasars and peak
star formation activity in the host galaxy. Despite the high level of star
formation, the bolometric output is dominated by the quasar in all cases. For a
given strength of 10 micron Si absorption, ULIRGs are significantly colder than
are type 2 quasars (their F_nu[14.5 micron]/F_nu[27.5 micron] ratio is 0.5 dex
lower), perhaps reflecting different obscuration geometries in these sources.
We find that the appearance of the 10 micron feature (i.e., whether it shows in
emission or in absorption) is well-correlated with the optical classification
in type 1 and type 2 quasars, contrary to some models of clumpy obscuration.
Furthermore, this correlation is significantly stronger in quasars (L_bol>10^45
erg/s) than it is in Seyfert galaxies (L_bol<<10^45 erg/s).

temperature $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model. We study systematically the
effects of pairing fluctuations and address all filling fractions over the
entire range of attractive interaction strength. While the attractive Hubbard
model can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein
condensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this
Hubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong
inter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling
when the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that
in a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC
limits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when
the system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.
We suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a
quantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously
connected to a BCS-like phase. We present a simple variational ansatz for the
ground state in this more strongly coupled superfluid. We further generalize
the (s-wave) Hubbard model to d-wave pairing and address issues of potential
relevance to high temperature superconductors. For the d-wave case, we present
a phase diagram and show that here too, one observes a vanishing of $T_c$ when
the pairing onset temperature $T^*$ becomes sufficiently large. We suggest that
future experiments on ultracold fermions in optical lattices should not be
exclusively limited to the repulsive Hubbard model, but should address the
attractive model in order to elucidate features of high temperature

range of atmospheres. Some super-Earths may be able to retain massive
hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Others might never accumulate hydrogen or experience
significant escape of lightweight elements, resulting in atmospheres more like
those of the terrestrial planets in our Solar System. We examine how an
observer could differentiate between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor
atmospheres by modeling super-Earth emission and transmission spectra, and we
find that discrimination is possible by observing the transmission spectrum
alone. An Earth-like atmosphere, composed of mostly heavy elements and
molecules, will have a very weak transmission signal due to its small
atmospheric scale height (since the scale height is inversely proportional to
molecular weight). On the other hand, a large hydrogen-rich atmosphere reveals
a relatively large transmission signal. The super Earth emission spectrum can
additionally contrain the atmospheric composition and temperature structure.
Super-Earths with massive hydrogen atmospheres will reveal strong spectral
features due to water, whereas those that have lost most of their hydrogen (and
have no liquid ocean) will be marked by CO$_2$ features and a lack of H$_2$O.
We apply our study specifically to the low-mass planet orbiting an M star, Gl
581c ($M sin i$ = 5 M$_{\earth}$), although our conclusions are relevant for
super-Earths in general. The ability to distinguish hydrogen-rich atmospheres
might be essential for interpreting mass and radius observations of planets in

stability. JWST is poised for the significant achievement of identifying
habitable planets around bright M through G stars--rocky planets lacking
extensive gas envelopes, with water vapor and signs of chemical disequilibrium
in their atmospheres. Favorable transiting planet systems, are, however,
anticipated to be rare and their atmosphere observations will require tens to
hundreds of hours of JWST time per planet. We review what is known about the

stars at a rate modulated by the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and gas outflow
occurs at a rate proportional to the star formation rate (SFR). With this
approach, we put broad constraints on the role of gas flows during this

significantly better than the closed box model at reproducing the observed

taking place in the last 7 Gyr, and relatively little in the last 3 Gyr. These
models predict most stars in this region to have [alpha/Fe] ratios lower than
the bulk of the Milky Way's halo. The predictions for the present-day SFR, gas

specific focus on the effects of the X-ray binaries' space velocity with
respect to the local Galactic standard of rest. We argue that, during late
stages in the evolution of large scale radio nebulae around microquasars, the
ram pressure of the interstellar medium due to the microquasar's space velocity
becomes important and that microquasars with high velocities form the Galactic
equivalent of extragalactic head-tail sources, i.e., that they leave behind
trails of stripped radio plasma. Because of their higher space velocities,
low-mass X-ray binaries are more likely to leave trails than high-mass X-ray
binaries. We show that the volume of radio plasma released by microquasars over
the history of the Galaxy is comparable to the disk volume and argue that a
fraction of a few percent of the radio plasma left behind by the X-ray binary
is likely mixed with the neutral phases of the ISM before the plasma is removed
from the disk by buoyancy. Because the formation of microquasars is an
unavoidable by-product of star formation, and because they can travel far from
their birth places, their activity likely has important consequences for the
evolution of magnetic fields in forming galaxies. We show that radio emission
from the plasma inside the trail should be detectable at low frequencies. We
suggest that LMXBs with high detected proper motions like XTE J1118+480 will be
the best candidates for such a search.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/592556",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I decompose the unstable growing modes of stellar disks to their Fourier
components and present the physical mechanism of instabilities in the context
of resonances. When the equilibrium distribution function is a non-uniform
function of the orbital angular momentum, the capture of stars into the
corotation resonance imbalances the disk angular momentum and triggers growing
bar and spiral modes. The stellar disk can then recover its angular momentum
balance through the response of non-resonant stars. I carry out a complete
analysis of orbital structure corresponding to each Fourier component in the
radial angle, and present a mathematical condition for the occurrence of van
Kampen modes, which constitute a continuous family. I discuss on the
discreteness and allowable pattern speeds of unstable modes and argue that the
mode growth is saturated due to the resonance overlapping mechanism. An
individually growing mode can also be suppressed if the corotation and inner
Lindblad resonances coexist and compete to capture a group of stars. Based on
this mechanism, I show that self-consistent scale-free disks with a sufficient
distribution of non-circular orbits should be stable under perturbations of
angular wavenumber $m>1$. I also derive a criterion for the stability of
stellar disks against non-axisymmetric excitations.

one of which the mid point of the Ag film remains fixed whereas the thickness
varies sinusoidally, while in the other the mid point oscillates sinusoidally
whereas the film thicknesses remains fixed. On reducing the light wavelength
from the long wavelength limit, we encounter signatures in the transmission, T,

plasmon mode, ii) the long-range surface plasmon mode, and iii) electromagnetic
diffraction tangent to the grating. The first two features can be regarded as
generalized (plasmon) Wood's anomalies whereas the third is the first-order
conventional (electromagnetic) Wood's anomaly. The energy density at the film
surface is enhanced for wavelengths corresponding to these three anomalies,
particularly for the long range plasmon mode in thin films. When exciting the
silver film with a pair of waves incident from opposite directions, we find
that by adjusting the grating oscillation amplitude and fixing the relative
phase of the incoming waves to be even or odd, T+R can be made to vanish for
one or the other of the plasmon modes; this corresponds to perfect coupling
(impedance matching in the language of electrical engineering) between the
incoming light and these modes.

high values ($A_V = 0.8 - 0.9$ mag) despite the low metallicity and thus the
low overall dust content. The small-scale extinction (spatial resolution
$\sim$0.3'') shows fluctuations that are most likely due to variations in the
dust distribution. We compare the distribution of the extinction to that of the
dust emission, traced by Spitzer emission at 8 and 24 \mi, and to the emission
of cold dust at 850 \mi. We find in general a good agreement between all
tracers, expect for the 850 \mi emission in NGC 4214 which is more extended
than the extinction and the other emissions. Whereas in NGC 1569 the dust
emission at all wavelengths is very similar, NGC 4214 shows spatial variations

structure around the cluster in the form of three clumps of galaxies. This is
potentially one of the largest structures found so far in the z>1 Universe. We
then examine stellar populations of galaxies in the structure. Red galaxies
have already become the dominant population in the cores of rich clusters at
z~1, and the fraction of red galaxies has not strongly changed since then. The
red fraction depends on richness of clusters in the sense that it is higher in
rich clusters than in poor groups. The luminosity function of red galaxies in
rich clusters is consistent with that in local clusters. On the other hand,
luminosity function of red galaxies in poor groups shows a deficit of faint red
galaxies. This confirms our earlier findings that galaxies follow an
environment-dependent down-sizing evolution. There seems to be a large
variation in the evolutionary phases of galaxies in groups with similar masses.
Further studies of high-z clusters will be a promising way of addressing the
role of nature and nurture effects on galaxy evolution.

discussion into a general Lagrange-Noether framework, the Minkowski tensor is
recovered as a canonical energy-momentum. It is shown that the balance
equations of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are always satisfied for an
open electromagnetic system despite the lack of the symmetry of the canonical

first principles, one can formulate a general symmetrization prescription
provided a timelike vector is available. We analyze in detail the variational
model of a relativistic ideal fluid with isotropic electric and magnetic
properties interacting with the electromagnetic field. The relation between the
Minkowski energy-momentum tensor, the canonical energy-momentum of the medium

amplitudes have structures much simpler than the traditional Feynman graph
driven approach would suggest. In particular, Parke and Taylor found a
particularly simple expression for the tree-level amplitudes with two gluons of
different helicity than the others (the so-called MHV amplitudes). Cachazo,
Svrcek and Witten (CSW) devised rules for constructing tree-level amplitudes by
sewing lower-valence MHV amplitudes together with scalar propagators. It was
shown by Mansfield in 2005 that a canonical change of the field variables could
be constructed that resulted in a lagrangian whose vertices were proportional
to MHV amplitudes, continued off-shell by CSW's prescription, the so-called
Canonical MHV Lagrangian. We derive the explicit form of this transformation
and use this to show that the vertices are indeed the Parke--Taylor amplitudes
for up to five gluons. Noting that CSW's MHV rules cannot be used to construct
the tree-level (-++) or one-loop (++++) amplitudes, we extend our work to
augment the MHV rules with so-called completion vertices. These permit
construction of these missing amplitudes by means of evasion of the S-matrix
equivalence theorem. Indeed, together they reconstruct off-shell light-cone
Yang-Mills amplitudes algebraically. We also give a prescription for
dimensional regularisation of the Canonical MHV Lagrangian. Finally, we
construct a canonical MHV lagrangian with massless fermions in the fundamental
representation using a similar methodology.

forming regions. Recently, some Class 0 protostars have been found to display
conditions similar to what are found in hot cores that are associated with
massive star formation. These hot corino sources have densities, gas
temperatures, and methanol abundances that are adequate for exciting strong 6.7
GHz maser emission. This raises the question of whether 6.7 GHz methanol masers
can be found in both hot corinos and massive star forming regions, and if not,
whether thermal methanol emission can be detected. We searched for the 6.7 GHz
methanol line towards five hot corino sources in the Perseus region using the
Arecibo radio telescope. To constrain the excitation conditions of methanol, we
observed thermal submillimeter lines of methanol in the NGC1333-IRAS 4 region
with the APEX telescope. We did not detect 6.7 GHz emission in any of the
sources, but found absorption against the cosmic microwave background in
NGC1333-IRAS 4A and NGC1333-IRAS 4B. Using a large velocity gradient analysis,
we modeled the excitation of methanol over a wide range of physical parameters,
and verify that the 6.7 GHz line is indeed strongly anti-inverted for densities
lower than 10^6 cm^-3. We used the submillimeter observations of methanol to
verify the predictions of our model for IRAS 4A by comparison with other CH3OH
transitions. Our results indicate that the methanol observations from the APEX
and Arecibo telescopes are consistent with dense (n ~ 10^6 cm^-3), cold (T ~
15-30 K) gas. The lack of maser emission in hot corinos and low-mass
protostellar objects in general may be due to densities that are much higher
than the quenching density in the region where the radiation field is conducive
to maser pumping.

for valid application of the tests. In previous papers and software, the
asymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for detecting genetic
linkage in multivariate variance components models has been stated to be a
mixture of chi-square distributions with binomial mixing probabilities. Here we
show, by simulation and by theoretical arguments based on the geometry of the
parameter space, that all aspects of the previously stated asymptotic null
distribution are incorrect--both the binomial mixing probabilities and the
chi-square components. Correcting the null distribution gives more conservative
critical values than previously stated, yielding P values that can easily be
ten times larger. The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to
the case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing
components show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the
asymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the
assessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings. We propose a
method to generate an asymptotic null distribution that is much faster than
other empirical methods such as gene-dropping, enabling us to obtain P values
with higher precision more efficiently.

which allows the lossless transmission of the compressed code words. The
benefit of compression is then the reduction of transmission errors in the

varieties behave when the projection center runs through the ambient space.
More precisely, let $X \subset \P^r$ be a projective variety satisfying
Green-Lazarsfeld's property $N_p$ for some $p \geq 2$, $q \in \P^r$ a closed
point outside of $X$, and $X_q := \pi_q (X) \subset \P^{r-1}$ the projected
image of $X$ from $q$. First, it is shown that the secant locus $\Sigma_q (X)$
of $X$ with respect to $q$, i.e. the set of all points on $X$ spanning secant
lines passing through $q$, is either empty or a quadric in a subspace of
$\P^r$. This implies that the finite morphism $\pi_q : X \to X_q$ is
birational. Our main result is that cohomological and local properties of $X_q$
are precisely determined by $\Sigma_q (X)$. To complete this result, the next
step should be to classify all possible secant loci and to decompose the
ambient space via the classification of secant loci. We obtain such a

visible on a plane that makes a 68 degree angle with respect to the core axis.
This failure surface was not induced by the decompression process but is indeed
a slip plane as clear striation is observed at the interface. On the basis of

$m$ translates of point lattices. In it we investigate the behavior of the
sphere packing density function and derive sufficient conditions for local
optimality. Using these criteria we prove that perfect, strongly eutactic
lattices cannot be locally improved to yield a periodic sphere packing with
greater density. This applies in particular to the densest known lattice sphere
packings in dimension $d\leq 8$ and $d=24$.

star core composed of nucleons, electrons and muons ($\eta_{e\mu}$ being the
electron-muon viscosity, mediated by collisions of electrons and muons with
charged particles, and $\eta_{n}$ the neutron viscosity, mediated by
neutron-neutron and neutron-proton collisions). Deriving $\eta_{e\mu}$, we take
into account the Landau damping in collisions of electrons and muons with
charged particles via the exchange of transverse plasmons. It lowers
$\eta_{e\mu}$ and leads to the non-standard temperature behavior
$\eta_{e\mu}\propto T^{-5/3}$. The viscosity $\eta_{n}$ is calculated taking
into account that in-medium effects modify nucleon effective masses in dense
matter. Both viscosities, $\eta_{e\mu}$ and $\eta_{n}$, can be important, and
both are calculated including the effects of proton superfluidity. They are
presented in the form valid for any equation of state of nucleon dense matter.
We analyze the density and temperature dependence of $\eta$ for different
equations of state in neutron star cores, and compare $\eta$ with the bulk
viscosity in the core and with the shear viscosity in the crust.
