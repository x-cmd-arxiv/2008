of immersed impurity atoms trapped by an optical lattice. We analytically show
that for a one-dimensional, ring-shaped setup the coupling of the impurities to
the Bogoliubov phonons of the condensate leads to a non-trivial phase in the
impurity hopping. The presence of this phase can be tested by observing a drift
in the transport properties of the impurities. These results are quantitatively
confirmed by a numerically exact simulation of a two-mode Bose-Hubbard model.
We also give analytical expressions for the occurring phase terms for a
two-dimensional setup. The phase realises an artificial magnetic field and can
for instance be used for the simulation of the quantum Hall effect using atoms
in an optical lattice.

high quantum input-output fidelity with storage times long compared to the

applicable to any linear storage medium ranging from a superconducting device
to an atomic medium. The temporal switching or gating of the device may either
be through a control field changing the coupling, or through a variable
detuning approach, as in more recent quantum memory experiments. An exact
calculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried
out. This shows that there is a mode-matching criterion which determines the
optimum input and output mode shape. This optimum pulse shape can be modified
by changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling
between the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of
long storage times. The quantum fidelity is calculated both for the coherent
state protocol, and for a completely arbitrary input state with a bounded total
photon number. We show how a dynamical quantum memory can surpass the relevant
classical memory bound, while retaining a relatively long storage time.

one of the least studied regimes of nucleosynthesis. One reason for this is
that after hydrogen burning, stellar evolution proceeds at conditions of equal
number of neutrons and protons or at a slight degree of neutron-richness.
Proton-rich nucleosynthesis in stars tends to occur only when hydrogen-rich
material that accretes onto a white dwarf or neutron star explodes, or when
neutrino interactions in the winds from a nascent proto-neutron star or
collapsar-disk drive the matter proton-rich prior to or during the
nucleosynthesis. In this paper we solve the NSE equations for a range of
proton-rich thermodynamic conditions. We show that cold proton-rich NSE is
qualitatively different from neutron-rich NSE. Instead of being dominated by
the Fe-peak nuclei with the largest binding energy per nucleon that have a
proton to nucleon ratio close to the prescribed electron fraction, NSE for
proton-rich material near freeze-out temperature is mainly composed of Ni56 and
free protons. Previous results of nuclear reaction network calculations rely on
this non-intuitive high proton abundance, which this paper will explain. We
show how the differences and especially the large fraction of free protons
arises from the minimization of the free energy as a result of a delicate
competition between the entropy and the nuclear binding energy.

scaling exponents computed from an interval of N observations is known for
finite variance processes to vary as ~1/N as N goes to infinity for certain

on the details of the process, and may be slow. We study the variation in the
scaling of second order moments of the time series increments with N, for a
variety of synthetic and `real world' time series; and find that in particular
for heavy tailed processes, for realizable N, one is far from this 1/N limiting

  To investigate the incidence of magnetic fields in O stars, we acquired 38
new spectropolarimetric observations with FORS1 (FOcal Reducer low dispersion
Spectrograph) mounted on the 8-m Kueyen telescope of the VLT.
  Spectropolarimetric observations have been obtained at different phases for a
sample of 13 O stars. 10 stars were observed in the spectral range 348-589nm,
HD36879 and HD148937 were observed in the spectral region 325-621nm, and
HD155806 was observed in both settings. To prove the feasibility of the FORS1
spectropolarimetric mode for the measurements of magnetic fields in hot stars,
we present in addition 12 FORS1 observations of the mean longitudinal magnetic
field in theta^1 Ori C and compare them with measurements obtained with the
MuSiCoS, ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters.
  Most stars in our sample which have been observed on different nights show a
change of the magnetic field polarity, but a field at a significance level of
3sigma has been detected only in four stars, HD36879, HD148937, HD152408, and

around the rigid particles increase the local energy dissipation, so that the
viscosity of the suspension is effectively higher than that of the solvent. For
bulk (three-dimensional) fluids, understanding this viscosity enhancement is a
classic problem in hydrodynamics that originated over a century ago with
Einstein's study of a dilute suspension of spherical particles.
\cite{Einstein1} In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem of the
effective viscosity of a suspension of disks embedded in a two-dimensional
membrane or interface. Unlike the hydrodynamics of bulk fluids, low-Reynolds
number membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale
generated by the coupling of the membrane to the bulk fluids that surround it.
As a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative
to this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective
viscosity of the suspension. Our study also helps to elucidate the mathematical
tools needed to solve the mixed boundary value problems that generically arise
when considering the motion of rigid inclusions in fluid membranes.

property that the local temperature in the structure depends on direction. This
is parametrized by the velocity anisotropy beta which must be zero for relaxed
collisional structures, but has been shown to be non-zero in numerical
simulations of dark matter structures. Here we present a method to infer the
radial profile of the velocity anisotropy of the dark matter halo in a galaxy
cluster from X-ray observables of the intracluster gas. This non-parametric
method is based on a universal relation between the dark matter temperature and
the gas temperature which is confirmed through numerical simulations. We apply
this method to observational data and we find that beta is significantly
different from zero at intermediate radii. Thus we find a strong indication
that dark matter is effectively collisionless on the dynamical time-scale of
clusters, which implies an upper limit on the self-interaction cross-section
per unit mass sigma/m < 1 cm2/g. Our results may provide an independent way to
determine the stellar mass density in the central regions of a relaxed cluster,

the Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK)

showed a significant improvement over the L_iso-E_peak relation. The new
proposed relation simply modifies the E_peak value by multiplying it by a power
of T_0.45, where T_0.45 is a particular measure of the GRB duration. We begin
by reproducing the results of Firmani for his 19 bursts. We then test the
Firmani relation for the same 19 bursts except that we use independently
measured values for L_iso, T_0.45, and E_peak, and we find that the relation
deteriorates substantially. We further test the relation by using 60 GRBs with
measured spectroscopic redshifts, and find a relation that has a comparable
scatter as the original L_iso-E_peak relation. That is, a much larger sample of
bursts does not reproduce the small scatter as reported by Firmani et al.
Finally, we investigate whether the Firmani relation is improved by the use of
any of 32 measures of duration in place of T_0.45. The quality of each
alternative duration measure is evaluated with the root mean square of the
scatter between the observed and fitted logarithmic Liso values. Although we
find some durations yield slightly better results than T_0.45, the differences
between the duration measures are minimal. We find that the addition of a
duration does not add any significant improvement to the L_iso-E_peak relation.
We also present a simple and direct derivation of the Firmani relation from
both the L_iso-E_peak and Amati relations. In all we conclude that the Firmani
relation neither has an independent existence nor does it provide any
significant improvement on previously known relations that are simpler.

  Gravitational parameters are those constants that parametrize possible

framework to describe torsion in the spacetime around the Earth, and show that
certain observables of the Gravity Probe B experiment can be computed in this
framework. We also search for viable theories of gravity where the Ricci scalar
R in the Lagrangian is replaced by an arbitrary function f(R). Making use of
the equivalence between such theories and scalar-tensor gravity, we find that
models can be made consistent with solar system constraints either by giving
the scalar a high mass or by exploiting the so-called Chameleon Effect.
  Cosmology can successfully describe the evolution of our universe using six
or more adjustable cosmological parameters. There is growing interest in using
3-dimensional neutral hydrogen mapping with the redshifted 21 cm line as a
cosmological probe. We quantify how the precision with which cosmological
parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We present
an accurate and robust method for measuring cosmological parameters that
exploits the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions
that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. We find that a
future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could have great
potential, improving the sensitivity to spatial curvature and neutrino masses
by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002 and Delta-m_nu ~

theory for a given nonconservative system requires prescribing a priori a
family of paths in the phase space. In the present paper, we consider schemes
that are formally consistent with a given family of paths, and we investigate
their limiting behavior as the mesh is refined. We generalize to systems a
property established earlier by Hou and LeFloch for scalar conservation laws,
and we prove that nonconservative schemes generate, at the level of the
limiting hyperbolic system, a ""convergence error"" source-term which, provided
the total variation of the approximations remains uniformly bounded, is a
locally bounded measure. We discuss the role of the equivalent equation
associated with a difference scheme; here, the distinction between scalar
equations and systems appears most clearly since, for systems, the equivalent
equation of a scheme that is formally path-consistent depends upon the
prescribed family of paths. The core of this paper is devoted to investigate
numerically the approximation of several models arising in fluid dynamics. For
systems having nonconservative products associated with linearly degenerate
characteristic fields, the convergence error vanishes. For some other models,
this measure is evaluated very accurately, especially by plotting the shock

well approximated by the Chang-Refsdal lensing for binaries with separations
greater than a certain limit. For binaries composed of equal mass lenses, we
find that the lens binarity can be noticed up to the separations of $\sim 60$

recently. When the density of electrons in the wire is very low, the strong
repulsion between electrons leads to the formation of a Wigner crystal. We
review the rich spin and orbital properties of the Wigner crystal, both in the
one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional regime. In the one-dimensional Wigner
crystal the electron spins form an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with
exponentially small exchange coupling. In the presence of leads the resulting
inhomogeneity of the electron density causes a violation of spin-charge
separation. As a consequence the spin degrees of freedom affect the conductance
of the wire. Upon increasing the electron density, the Wigner crystal starts
deviating from the strictly one-dimensional geometry, forming a zigzag
structure instead. Spin interactions in this regime are dominated by ring
exchanges, and the phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has a
number of unpolarized phases as well as regions of complete and partial spin
polarization. Finally we address the orbital properties in the vicinity of the
transition from a one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional state. Due to the
locking between chains in the zigzag Wigner crystal, only one gapless mode
exists. Manifestations of Wigner crystal physics at weak interactions are
explored by studying the fate of the additional gapped low-energy mode as a
function of interaction strength.

the side-jump mechanism for the anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, at high

trust in when facing scenarios for which we have little or no experience upon
which we can base our decision. In this paper, we consider such behavior in
atomic congestion games. We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that
emerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this
agents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our
main focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument,
we show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states. In
such a state none of the players can improve its latency by imitating somebody
else. As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria.
At an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a
latency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics
behave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all
other parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on
the number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot
discover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with
non-zero probability. For the case of singleton games, we show that the
probability of this event occurring is negligible. Additionally, we prove that
the social cost of a stable state reached by our dynamics is not much worse
than an optimal state in singleton congestion games with linear latency
function. Finally, we discuss how the protocol can be extended such that, in
the long run, dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium.

Molecular cloud cores are ionized and heated to high temperatures after the
onset of nuclear burning of a central protostar. We model subsequent
evolutionary processes in several ways and construct possible self-similar
shock flow solutions. We may neglect the mass and gravity of the central
protostar. The ionization and heating of the surrounding medium drive outflows
in the inner cloud core and a shock travels outwards, leading to the so-called

cloud expands plausibly due to powerful stellar winds, a cavity (i.e., `void'
or `bubble') can be created around the centre, and when the cavity becomes
sufficiently large, one may neglect the gravity of the central protostar. We
thus present self-similar shock solutions for ""champagne flows"" with an
expanding central void. We compare our solutions with isothermal solutions and

the Hamiltonian involved must have local structure, which leads to a result
about eigenvalue gaps from information theory. I also improve results about
simulating quantum circuits with AQC. Second, I look at classically simulating
time evolution with local Hamiltonians and finding their ground state
properties. I give a numerical method for finding the ground state of
translationally invariant Hamiltonians on an infinite tree. This method is
based on imaginary time evolution within the Matrix Product State ansatz, and
uses a new method for bringing the state back to the ansatz after each
imaginary time step. I then use it to investigate the phase transition in the
transverse field Ising model on the Bethe lattice. Third, I focus on locally
constrained quantum problems Local Hamiltonian and Quantum Satisfiability and
prove several new results about their complexity. Finally, I define a
Hamiltonian Quantum Cellular Automaton, a continuous-time model of computation
which doesn't require control during the computation process, only preparation
of product initial states. I construct two of these, showing that time
evolution with a simple, local, translationally invariant and time-independent

finite groups on the boundary of quasifuchsian space for which the `top' end is
homeomorphic to \Sigma, while the `bottom' end consists of two triply punctured
spheres, the remains of \Sigma when two fixed disjoint curves have been
pinched. As such representations vary in the character variety, the conformal
structure on the top side varies over the Teichm\""uller space T(\Sigma).
  We investigate M when \Sigma is a twice punctured torus, using the method of
pleating rays. Fix a projective measure class [\mu] supported on closed curves
on \Sigma. The pleating ray P_[\mu] consists of those groups in M for which the
bending measure of the top component of the convex hull boundary of the
associated 3-manifold is in [\mu]. It is known that P is a real 1-submanifold
of M. Our main result is a formula for the asymptotic direction of P in M as
the bending measure tends to zero, in terms of natural parameters for the
2-complex dimensional representation space R and the Dehn-Thurston coordinates
of the support curves to [\mu] relative to the pinched curves on the bottom
side. This leads to a method of locating M in R.

inverse gravitational radius of the black hole. But the KS entropy is the same
for all objects collapsing into the black hole. The nature of this universality
is that the KS entropy possesses the main property of temperature: it is the
same for all bodies in thermal equilibrium with the black hole. The
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy measures the rate at which information about the

reveal anomalies in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, including
the so called ""specific heat peak"" in the vicinity of the glass transition. The
aim of this paper is to provide theoretical explanations of these anomalies in
general and a quantitative theory in the case of a simple model of
glass-formation. We first present new simulation results for the specific heat
in a classical model of a binary mixture. We show that in addition to the
formerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower
temperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. Second, we
present a general relation between the specific heat and the bulk modulus and
thus offer a smooth connection between the liquid and amorphous solid states.
The central result of this paper is a connection between the micro-melting of
clusters in the system and the appearance of specific heat peaks. We relate the
two peaks to changes in the bulk and shear moduli. We propose that the
phenomenon of glass-formation is accompanied by a fast change in the bulk and
the shear moduli, but these fast changes occur in different ranges of the
temperature. Lastly, we demonstrate how to construct a theory of the frequency
dependent complex specific heat, expected from heterogeneous clustering in the
liquid state of glass formers. A specific example is provided in the context of
our model for the dynamics of glycerol. The theoretical frequency dependent
specific heat agrees well with experimental measurements on glycerol. We
conclude the paper by stating that there is nothing universal about the
temperature dependence of the specific heat in glass formers - unfortunately
one needs to understand each case by itself.

self-consistently using the GW0 approximation for the single-particle
self-energy. In this way, correlation effects which go beyond the mean-field
description of the plasma are contained, i.e. the collisional damping of
single-particle states, the dynamical screening of the interaction and the
appearance of collective plasma modes. Secondly, a novel non-perturbative
analytic solution for the on-shell GW0 self-energy as a function of momentum is
presented. It reproduces the numerical data for the spectral function with a
relative error of less than 10% in the regime where the Debye screening
parameter is smaller than the inverse Bohr radius, kappa<1/a_B. In the limit of
low density, the non-perturbative self-energy behaves as n^(1/4), whereas a
perturbation expansion leads to the unphysical result of a density independent
self-energy [W. Fennel and H. P. Wilfer, Ann. Phys. Lpz._32_, 265 (1974)]. The
derived expression will greatly facilitate the calculation of observables in
correlated plasmas (transport properties, equation of state) that need the
spectral function as an input quantity. This is demonstrated for the shift of
the chemical potential, which is computed from the analytical formulae and
compared to the GW0-result. At a plasma temperature of 100 eV and densities
below 10^21 cm^-3, both approaches deviate less than 10% from each other.

orbiting its host star. As the planet eclipses the star, it may pass in front
of a starspot which will then make itself known through small flux variations
in the transit light curve. If we are lucky enough to catch the same spot on
two consecutive transits, it is possible to estimate the stellar rotational
period. This method is successfully tested on transit simulations on the Sun
yielding the correct value for the solar period. By detecting two starspots on
more than one transit of HD 209458 observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, it
was possible to estimate a period of either 9.9 or 11.4 days for the star,
depending on which spot is responsible for the signature in the light curve a
few transits later. Comparison with period estimates of HD209458 reported in

ensemble of point particles. The multi-particle collisions are performed by
grouping particles in collision cells, and mass, momentum, and energy are
locally conserved. This simulation technique captures both full hydrodynamic
interactions and thermal fluctuations. The first part of the review begins with
a description of several widely used MPC algorithms and then discusses
important features of the original SRD algorithm and frequently used
variations. Two complementary approaches for deriving the hydrodynamic
equations and evaluating the transport coefficients are reviewed. It is then
shown how MPC algorithms can be generalized to model non-ideal fluids, and
binary mixtures with a consolute point. The importance of angular-momentum
conservation for systems like phase-separated liquids with different
viscosities is discussed. The second part of the review describes a number of
recent applications of MPC algorithms to study colloid and polymer dynamics,

identify two young clusters with massive stars, three intermediate age open
clusters, and two globular cluster candidates among our targets. The remaining
seven objects are unlikely to be stellar clusters. Among them is the object
FSR1767 which has previously been identified as a globular cluster using 2MASS
data by Bonatto et al. (2007). Our new analysis shows that FSR1767 is not a
star cluster. We also summarise the currently available follow-up analysis of
the FSR candidates and conclude that this catalogue may contain a large number
of new stellar clusters, probably dominated by old open clusters.
