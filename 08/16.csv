two three-dimensional CFT's: the usual Dirichlet CFT1 where the fixed graviton
acts as a source for the stress-energy tensor, and a dual CFT2 with a fixed
dual graviton which acts as a source for a dual stress-energy tensor. The dual
stress-energy tensor is shown to be the Cotton tensor of the Dirichlet CFT. The
two CFT's are related by a Legendre transformation generated by a gravitational
Chern-Simons coupling. This duality is a gravitational version of
electric-magnetic duality valid at any radius r, where the renormalized
stress-energy tensor is the electric field and the Cotton tensor is the
magnetic field. Generic Robin boundary conditions lead to CFT's coupled to
Cotton gravity or topologically massive gravity. Interaction terms with CFT1
lead to a non-zero vev of the stress-energy tensor in CFT2 coupled to gravity
even after the source is removed. We point out that the dual graviton also
exists beyond the linearized approximation, and spell out some of the details
of the non-linear construction.

perturbations are studied for the quintessential scalar fields $Q$ with the
classical Lagrangian satisfying the additional condition $w=const$ or
$c^2_a=0$. Both quintessential fields are studied for the same cosmological
model. The systems of evolutionary equations for gauge-invariant perturbations
of metrics, matter and quintessence have been analysed analyticaly for the
early stage of the Universe life and numerically up to the present epoch. It is
shown that amplitudes of the adiabatic matter density perturbations grow like
in $\Lambda$CDM-model but time dependences of amplitudes of the quintessence
perturbations are more varied: gauge-invariant variables $D_g^{(Q)}$ and
$D_s^{(Q)}$ decay from initial constant value after entering the particle
horizon while $D^{(Q)}$ and $V^{(Q)}$ grow at the early stage before entering
the horizon and decay after that -- in the quintessence-dominated epoch, when
gravitational potential starts to decay -- so, that at the current epoch they
are approximately two orders lower than matter ones at the supercluster scale.
Therefore, at the subhorizon scales the quintessential scalar fields are
smoothed out while the matter clusters. It is also shown that both
quintessential scalar fields suppress the growth of matter density
perturbations and the amplitude of gravitational potential. In these
QCDM-models -- unlike $\Lambda$CDM ones -- such suppression is scale dependent
and more visible for the quintessence with $c^2_a=0$.

the system (two projections of spin, two valleys, and two layers) and to the
suppression of backscattering in graphene, the maximum possible strength of the

treatment applicable. We calculate the mean-field transition temperature for a
clean system and demonstrate that its highest possible value
$T_c^\text{max}\sim 10^{-7}\epsilon_F\lesssim 1 \text{mK}$ is extremely small

suppress the condensate completely. Our findings renders experimental

theorem only brings out a conflict with determinism or the hidden-variables
program or realism or some other such principle that (unlike local causality),
allegedly, nobody should have believed anyway. (Moreover, typically such

they are accepting differs so radically from Bell's own.) Here we try to shed
some light on the situation by focusing on the concept of local causality that

understanding with the analysis of Jon Jarrett which has been the most
influential source, in recent decades, for the kinds of claims mentioned

  Transmission-Capacity Trade-Off","23 pages, 7 figures, submitted for publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectrum sharing between wireless networks improves the efficiency of
spectrum usage, and thereby alleviates spectrum scarcity due to growing demands
for wireless broadband access. To improve the usual underutilization of the
cellular uplink spectrum, this paper studies spectrum sharing between a
cellular uplink and a mobile ad hoc networks. These networks access either all
frequency sub-channels or their disjoint sub-sets, called spectrum underlay and
spectrum overlay, respectively. Given these spectrum sharing methods, the
capacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed based on the
transmission capacity of a network with Poisson distributed transmitters. This
metric is defined as the maximum density of transmitters subject to an outage
constraint for a given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Using tools from
stochastic geometry, the transmission-capacity trade-off between the coexisting
networks is analyzed, where both spectrum overlay and underlay as well as
successive interference cancelation (SIC) are considered. In particular, for
small target outage probability, the transmission capacities of the coexisting
networks are proved to satisfy a linear equation, whose coefficients depend on
the spectrum sharing method and whether SIC is applied. This linear equation
shows that spectrum overlay is more efficient than spectrum underlay.
Furthermore, this result also provides insight into the effects of different
network parameters on transmission capacities, including link diversity gains,
transmission distances, and the base station density. In particular, SIC is
shown to increase transmission capacities of both coexisting networks by a
linear factor, which depends on the interference-power threshold for qualifying
canceled interferers.

discovered via its young, steep-spectrum lobes and their creation was likely
triggered by the interaction, we argue that we are witnessing an early-stage
merger, prior to its eventual equilibrium state. The interaction is between the
host galaxy of an actively-fueled BH, and a gas-rich starburst/AGN (B) marked
by the compact submm component and coincident with broad CO emission. `A' is a
plume of cold, dusty gas, associated with a narrow (~150 km/s) CO feature, and
may represent a short-lived tidal structure. It has been claimed that HzRGs and
SMGs differ only in the activity of their AGNs, but such complex submm
morphologies are seen only rarely amongst SMGs. Our study has important
implications: where a galaxy's gas is not aligned with its central BH, CO may
be an unreliable probe of dynamical mass, affecting work on the co-assembly of
BHs and spheroids. Our data support the picture wherein close binary AGN are
induced by mergers. They also raise the possibility that some supposedly

reconsider this problem. Using superposition of topological, combinatorial and
London-style qualitative arguments, we prove the existence of screening in
suspensions. We show that the nature of hydrodynamic screening in suspensions
is analogous to that known for the Meissner effect in superconductors. The
extent of screening depends on volume fraction of hard spheres. The zero volume
fraction limit corresponds to the normal state. The case of finite volume
fractions-to the mixed state typical for superconductors of the second kind.
Such a state is becoming fully ""superconducting"" at some critical volume
fraction for which the (zero frequency) relative viscosity diverges. Our
analytical results describing this divergence are in accord with known scaling
results obtained by Brady and Bicerano et al which are well supported by
experimental data. We provide theoretical explanation of the divergence of
relative viscosity in terms of a topological-type transition which
mathematically can be made isomorphic to the more familiar Bose-Einstein
condensation transition. Because of this, the methods developed in this work
are not limited to suspensions only. In concluding section we mention other

can be fit by a single power law over the sampled time scales. Variations in
flux at all three wavebands are significantly correlated. The time delay
between high and low frequency bands changes substantially on time scales of
years. A major multi-frequency flare in 2001 coincided with a swing of the jet
toward a more southerly direction, and in general the X-ray flux is modulated
by changes in the position angle of the jet near the core. The flux density in

Kepler and the random geometries explored by Bernal in the 60's. This problem
finds applications spanning from the mathematician's pencil, the processing of
granular materials, the jamming and glass transitions, all the way to fruit
packing in every grocery. There are presently numerous experiments showing that
the loosest way to pack spheres gives a density of ~55% (RLP) while filling all
the loose voids results in a maximum density of ~63-64% (RCP). While those
values seem robustly true, to this date there is no physical explanation or
theoretical prediction for them. Here we show that random packings of
monodisperse hard spheres in 3d can pack between the densities 4/(4 + 2 \sqrt
3) or 53.6% and 6/(6 + 2 \sqrt 3) or 63.4%, defining RLP and RCP, respectively.
The reason for these limits arises from a statistical picture of jammed states
in which the RCP can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of
jammed matter with zero compactivity, while the RLP arises in the infinite
compactivity limit. We combine an extended statistical mechanics approach 'a la
Edwards' (where the role traditionally played by the energy and temperature in
thermal systems is substituted by the volume and compactivity) with a
constraint on mechanical stability imposed by the isostatic condition.
Ultimately, our results lead to a phase diagram that provides a unifying view
of the disordered hard sphere packing problem.

AdS-type five dimensional bulk space, which mimic a Randall-Sundrum scenario.
First, we consider a membrane described by only a single real scalar field. In
that scenarios we find that there is no localized tensorial zero mode. When we
take into account branes described by two real scalar fields with internal
structures, we obtain again a non-localized zero mode for a Kalb-Ramond
tensorial gauge field. After modifying our model of one single scalar field by
coupling the dilaton to the Kalb-Ramond field, we find that this result is
changed. Furthermore, we analyze Kaluza-Klein massive modes and resonance
structures.

emerging from the non-trivial spatial dynamics of valence gluons. The lattice
data suggest that these gluons interact with each other linearly at large
spatial separations. At high temperatures, valence gluons should reproduce the
pressure of the non-interacting Stefan-Boltzmann plasma along with the leading
perturbative correction. These properties of valence gluons can be modeled in
terms of the integral over their trajectories. We calculate such a world-line
integral analytically and obtain the pressure and the interaction measure
$(\varepsilon-3p)/T^4$ of the gluon plasma. Additionally, we account for the
contributions of stochastic background fields to these thermodynamic
quantities. The results turn out to be in a good agreement with the
corresponding lattice data. In particular, the lattice-simulated peak of the
interaction measure near the deconfinement critical temperature is reproduced.

different definitions affect the statistical distribution of urban activity. A
commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (MSA), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of
city as a functional economic region, and is constructed using experience. The
MSA is time-consuming and is typically constructed only for a subset (few
hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a new method
to designate metropolitan areas, denoted the ""City Clustering Algorithm"" (CCA).
The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine
geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative
boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat's law of proportional growth,
postulating that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities
are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a
cluster utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat's law, and that the
standard deviation decreases as a power-law with respect to the city size. The
CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations,
shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in the
population growth. These results have socio-political implications, such as
those pertaining to the location of new economic development in cities of
varied size.

The models predict that there is a threshold density of functionalized charge,
above which capsids efficiently assemble around nanoparticles, and that light
scatter intensity increases rapidly at early times, without the lag phase
characteristic of empty capsid assembly. These predictions are consistent with,
and enable interpretation of, preliminary experimental data. However, the
models predict a stronger dependence of nanoparticle incorporation efficiency
on functionalized charge density than measured in experiments, and do not
completely capture a logarithmic growth phase seen in experimental light

alterations due to perturbations propagating into the bulk appear as excess CMB

Curvature can reduce the tension between distance measures but only at the

the initial conditions to reduce large scale power can flatten the temperature
spectrum, this also suppresses the large angle polarization spectrum in

to mimic many systems from solid state and fluid physics, due to their strong
electrostatic interaction, their large inertia, and the fact that they are
large enough to be visualized with ordinary optics. On Earth, gravity restricts
the so called dusty plasma systems to thin, two-dimensional layers, unless
special experimental geometries are used, involving heated or cooled electrons,
and/or the use of dielectric materials.In micro-gravity experiments, the
formation of a dust-free void breaks the isotropy of three-dimensional dusty
plasma systems. In order to do real three-dimensional experiments, this void
has somehow to be closed. In this paper, we use a fully self-consistent fluid
model to study the closure of a void in a micro-gravity experiment, by lowering
the driving potential. The analysis goes beyond the simple description of the
virtual void, which describes the formation of a void without taking the dust
into account. We show that self-organization plays an important role in void
formation and void closure, which also allows a reversed scheme, where a
discharge is run at low driving potentials and small batches of dust are added.
No hysteresis is found this way. Finally, we compare our results to recent
experiments and find good agreement,but only when we do not take
charge-exchange collisions into account.

  We discuss the variations of the Fourier coefficients with periods and point
out on the sharp feature for periods around 0.35 days of first-overtone

P=10 days for F Cepheids are also interpreted as an effect of resonances
between two radial modes. We fit the period-luminosity relations to our sample

  of weak scattering X-ray photons","29 pages, 8 figures Submitted to Physical Review E, Thu May 22 2008",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.78.041906",,"physics.optics physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The number of photons available by coherent X-ray scattering from a single
biomolecule is considerably less because of the extremely small
elastic-scattering cross-section and low damage threshold. Even with a high
X-ray flux of 3 x 10to 12 photons per 100-nm-diameter spot and an ultrashort
pulse of 10 fs driven by a future X-ray free electron laser (X-ray FEL), it has
been predicted that only a few 100 photons will be available by scattering from
a single lysozyme molecule. In this paper I propose a new method: instead of
directly observing the photons scattered from the sample, we amplify the
scattered waves by superimposing an intense coherent reference pump wave on it
and record the resulting interference pattern using a planar X-ray detector,
similar to technique followed in holography. Using a nanosized gold particle as
a reference pump wave source, we can collect 10 to 4 ~ 10 to 5 photons in
single shot imaging where the signal from a single biomolecule is amplified and
recorded as 2D diffraction intensity data. To recover the phase information and
reconstruct the image, the iterative phase retrieval technique will be
applicable. However, the technical difficulty is how to precisely reconstruct
faint image of the single bio-molecular in Angstrom resolution, whose intensity
is much lower than the bright gold particle linked to it. In order to solve
this problem, I propose a new scheme that combines the iterative
phase-retrieval on reference pump wave and digital Fourier transform
holography.

off-diagonal, positive phase-space representation analogous to the positive
P-function. As an illustration of the phase-space method, we use the example of
the Ising model, which has exact solutions for the finite temperature canonical
ensemble in two dimensions. We show how a canonical ensemble for an Ising model
of arbitrary structure can be efficiently simulated using SU(2) or atomic
coherent states. The technique utilizes a transformation from a canonical
(imaginary-time) weighted simulation to an equivalent unweighted real-time
simulation. The results are compared to the exactly soluble two-dimensional
case. We note that Ising models in one, two or three dimensions are potentially
achievable experimentally as a lattice-gas of ultra-cold atoms in optical
lattices. The technique is not restricted to canonical ensembles or to
Ising-like couplings. It is also able to be used for real-time evolution, and
for systems whose time-evolution follows a master-equation describing
decoherence and coupling to external reservoirs. The case of SU(n) phase-space
is used to describe n-level systems. In general, the requirement that
time-evolution is stochastic corresponds to a restriction to Hamiltonians and

that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or
underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this
simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated
in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by
non-native contacts, typically imagined as a consequence of sequence design
and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied
lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed
correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of
thousands of amino acid sequences, and a concomitantly diverse set of folding
pathways. Enabled by a novel means of fingerprinting folding trajectories, our
study reveals a profound insensitivity of the order in which native contacts
accumulate to the omission of non-native interactions. Contrary to conventional
thinking, this robustness does not arise from topological restrictions and does
not depend on folding rate. We find instead that the crucial factor in
discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native
contact energies. Our results challenge conventional thinking on the
relationship between sequence design and free energy landscapes for protein
folding, and help justify the widespread use of Go-like models to scrutinize
detailed folding mechanisms of real proteins.

splitting of fast and slow potential forces: rather than splitting these forces
at the level of the differential equations or the Hamiltonian, we split the two
potentials with respect to the Lagrangian action integral. By using a different
quadrature rule to approximate the contribution of each potential to the
action, we arrive at a geometric integrator that is implicit in the fast force
and explicit in the slow force. This can allow for significantly longer time
steps to be taken (compared to standard explicit methods, such as
St\""ormer/Verlet) at the cost of only a linear solve rather than a full
nonlinear solve. We also analyze the stability of this method, in particular
proving that it eliminates the linear resonance instabilities that can arise
with explicit multiple-time-stepping methods. Next, we perform some numerical
experiments, studying the behavior of this integrator for two test problems: a
system of coupled linear oscillators, for which we compare against the
resonance behavior of the r-RESPA method; and slow energy exchange in the
Fermi--Pasta--Ulam problem, which couples fast linear oscillators with slow
nonlinear oscillators. Finally, we prove that this integrator accurately
preserves the slow energy exchange between the fast oscillatory components,

vocabularies, are used to provide subject access to information systems across
the web. Due to the heterogeneity of these systems, mapping between
vocabularies becomes crucial for retrieving relevant information. However,
mapping thesauri is a laborious task, and thus big efforts are being made to
automate the mapping process. This paper examines two mapping approaches
involving the agricultural thesaurus AGROVOC, one machine-created and one human
created. We are addressing the basic question ""What are the pros and cons of
human and automatic mapping and how can they complement each other?"" By
pointing out the difficulties in specific cases or groups of cases and grouping
the sample into simple and difficult types of mappings, we show the limitations
of current automatic methods and come up with some basic recommendations on
what approach to use when.

under different magnetic fields (H) in Eu$_{1-x}$La$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single
crystals. It is found that a metamagnetic transition from A-type
antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at a critical field for magnetic
sublattice of $Eu^{2+}$. The jump of specific heat is suppressed and shifts to
low temperature with increasing H up to the critical value, then shifts to high
temperature with further increasing H. Such behavior supports the metamagnetic
transition. Detailed H-T phase diagrams for x=0 and 0.15 crystals are given,
and possible magnetic structure is proposed. Magnetoresistance measurements
indicate that there exists a strong coupling between local moment of $Eu^{2+}$
and charge in Fe-As layer. These results are very significant to understand the
underlying physics of FeAs superconductors.

that the reflectance spectrum in this wavelength range changes rapidly and
saturates the depth of the 0.95 um absorption in less than 0.45 Myr in the main

interactions between the chiral bosonic edge modes of the half-filled Landau
level (assuming a Pfaffian wave function for the half-filled state) and of the
two fully filled Landau levels. In the presence of inter-edge Coulomb
interactions between all the six edges participating in the line junction, the
stable fixed point corresponds to a point contact which is neither fully opaque
nor fully transparent. Remarkably, this fixed point represents a situation
where the half-filled level is fully transmitting, while the two filled levels
are completely backscattered; hence the fixed point Hall conductance is given
by G_H = {1/2} e^2/h. We predict the non-universal temperature power laws by
which the system approaches the stable fixed point from the two unstable fixed
points corresponding to the fully connected case (G_H = {5/2} e^2/h) and the
fully disconnected case (G_H = 0).

models which are diffusive. An introductory chapter gives motivation, and then
a review of statistical properties of dynamical systems is given in chapter 2.
In chapter 3, we study the geometry dependence of diffusion coefficients in a
two-parameter 2D periodic Lorentz gas model, including a discussion of how to
estimate them from data. In chapter 4, we study the shape of position and
displacement distributions, which occur in the central limit theorem. We show
that there is an oscillatory fine structure and what its origin is. This allows
us to conjecture a refinement of the central limit theorem in these systems. A
non-Maxwellian velocity distribution is shown to lead to a non-Gaussian limit
distribution. Chapter 5 treats polygonal billiard channels, developing a
picture of when normal and anomalous diffusion occur, the latter being due to
parallel scatterers in the billiard causing a channelling effect. We also
characterize the crossover from normal to anomalous diffusion. In chapter 6, we
extend our methods to a 3D periodic Lorentz gas model, showing that normal
diffusion occurs under certain conditions. In particular, we construct an
explicit finite-horizon model, and we discuss the effect that holes in
configuration space have on the diffusive properties of the system. We finish
with conclusions and directions for future research.

breakthrough in very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics. While early IACT
installations faced the problem of detecting any sources at all, current
instruments are able to see many sources, often over more than two orders of
magnitude in energy. As instruments and analysis methods have matured, the
requirements for calibration and modelling of physical and instrumental effects
have increased. In this article, a set of Monte Carlo simulation tools is
described that attempts to include all relevant effects for IACTs in great
detail but aims to achieve this in an efficient and flexible way. These tools
were originally developed for the HEGRA IACT system and later adapted for the
H.E.S.S. experiment. Their inherent flexibility to describe quite arbitrary
IACT systems makes them also an ideal tool for evaluating the potential of
future installations. It is in use for design studies of CTA and other
projects.

states with equilibrium distances of the order of experimentally attainable
inter-well spacings and binding energies of the order of 10^3 GHz. We also
consider the situation whereby ground-state atoms trapped in an optical lattice
are collectively excited to Rydberg levels, such that the charge-density

interaction matrix elements between highly-excited electrons separated by
distances comparable to typical lattice spacings. Such systems have tunable
interaction parameters and a temperature ~10^{-4} times smaller than the Fermi
temperature, making them potentially attractive for the study and simulation of
strongly correlated electronic systems.
