Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century.
The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures
were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of
liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the
tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex
systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration.
Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and
its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological
properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree

results and the three next papers set out the details. In this second paper, we
derive the full BRS operator and action for the general massless Wess-Zumino
chiral supersymmetry action. This includes the source terms which bring in the
equations of motion. The auxiliary field is integrated, which removes manifest
supersymmetry, but which allows the Legendre transform to operate correctly to
define one-particle-irreducible vertices from the connected Green's functions.
Then some special terms in the BRS cohomology are described, together with the
constraint equations that they must satisfy. These `simple dotspinors' are
generated by a `fundamental dotspinor', which is constructed partly from the
Zinn sources. The equations of motion play a very important role in the
cohomology for this theory. These dotspinors play an interesting role in the
BRS cohomology of the standard model, which is the subject of the third paper

representation theorem similar to those for exchangeable sequences, arrays and
set-indexed families. In this note we to prove that, whereas the known
representation theorems for different classes of partially exchangeable
probability measure imply that the compact convex set of such measures is a
Bauer simplex (that is, its subset of extreme points is closed), in the case of
cube-exchangeability it is a copy of the Poulsen simplex (in which the extreme
points are dense). This follows from the arguments used by Glasner and Weiss'
for their characterization of property (T) in terms of the geometry of the
simplex of invariant measures for associated generalized Bernoulli actions.
  The emergence of this Poulsen simplex suggests that, if a representation
theorem for these processes is available at all, it must take a very different

resonance, are considered a major cause of temporary satellite capture (TSC) by
Jupiter. Though the QHCs may be escaped Hilda asteroids, their origin and
nature have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. Of particular interest
are long TSCs/orbiters. Orbiters -- in which at least one full revolution about
the planet is completed -- are rare astronomical events; only four have been
known to occur in the last several decades. Every case has been associated with
a QHC: 82P/Gehrels 3; 111P/Helin-Roman-Crockett; P/1996 R2 (Lagerkvist); and
the possibly QHC-derived D/1993 F2 (Shoemaker-Levy 9, SL9). We focus on long
TSC/orbiter events involving QHCs and Jupiter. Thus we survey the known QHCs,
searching for further long TSCs/orbiters over the past century. First, we
confirmed the long TSC/orbiter events of 82P, 111P, and 1996 R2 in order to
test our method against previous work, applying a general N-body Newtonian
code. We then used the same procedure to survey the remaining known QHCs and
search for long TSC/orbiter events. We newly identified another long
TSC/orbiter: 147P/Kushida-Muramatsu from 1949 May 14 (+97days/-106 days)--1961
July 15. Our result is verified by integrations of 243 cloned orbits which take
account of the present orbital uncertainty of this comet. This is the third
long TSC and the fifth orbiter to be found, thus long TSC/orbiter events
involving Jupiter have occurred once per decade. Two full revolutions about
Jupiter were completed and the capture duration was 12.17 (+0.29/-0.27) years;
both these numbers rank 147P as third among long TSC/orbiter events, behind SL9
and 111P. This study also confirms the importance of the QHC region as a
dynamical route into and out of Jovian TSC, via the Hill's sphere.

electrostatic potential and electric field inside cavities created in the fluid
of dipolar hard spheres. We found that the thermodynamics of polar solvation
dramatically changes its regime when the cavity size becomes about 4-5 times
larger than the size of the liquid particle. The range of small cavities can be
reasonably understood within the framework of current solvation models. On the
contrary, the regime of large cavities is characterized by a significant
softening of the cavity interface resulting in a decay of the fluctuation
variances with the cavity size much faster than anticipated by both the
continuum electrostatics and microscopic theories. For instance, the variance
of potential decays with the cavity size $R_0$ approximately as $1/R_0^{4-6}$
instead of the $1/R_0$ scaling expected from standard electrostatics. Our
results suggest that cores of non-polar molecular assemblies in polar liquids
lose solvation strength much faster than is traditionally anticipated.

pattern in the intensity distribution requires a spatially coherent source.
Optical waves emitted from portions beyond the coherence area possess
statistically independent phases, and will degrade the interference pattern. In
this paper we show an optical interference experiment, which seems contrary to
our common knowledge, that the formation of the interference pattern is related
to a spatially incoherent light source. Our experimental scheme is very similar
to Gabor's original proposal of holography[1], just with an incoherent source
replacing the coherent one. In the statistical ensemble of the incoherent
source, each sample field produces a sample interference pattern between object
wave and reference wave. These patterns completely differ from each other due
to the fluctuation of the source field distribution. Surprisingly, the sum of a
great number of sample patterns exhibits explicitly an interference pattern,
which contains all the information of the object and is equivalent to a
hologram in the coherent light case. In this sense our approach would be
valuable in holography and other interference techniques for the case where
coherent source is unavailable, such as x-ray and electron sources.

taking the limit $m_A*r_c \to \infty$, where $r_c$ is a radius of the body. We
show the existence of ""no-shell"" solutions where the field is nearly frozen in
the whole interior of the body, which does not necessarily correspond to the

condition $m_A*r_c \gg 1$, the effective coupling of $\phi$ with matter takes
the same asymptotic form as that in the thin-shell case. We study experimental
bounds coming from the violation of equivalence principle as well as
solar-system tests for a number of models including $f(R)$ gravity and find
that the field is in either the thin-shell or the no-shell regime under such

that, for the consistency with local gravity constraints, the field at the

the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) network using the Westerbork, Jodrell
Bank, Effelsberg and Nancay radio telescopes. The data were analysed using the
updated timing software Tempo2. We have improved the timing solution for this
double neutron star system. The periastron advance has been refined and a
significant detection of proper motion is presented. It is not likely that more
post-Keplerian parameters, with which the individual neutron star masses and
the inclination angle of the system can be determined separately, can be
measured in the near future. Using a combination of the high-quality data sets
present in the EPTA collaboration, extended with the original GBT data, we have
constrained the masses in the system to m_p<1.17 msun and m_c>1.55 msun (95.4%
confidence), and the inclination angle of the orbit to be less than 47 degrees
(99%). From this we derive that the pulsar in this system possibly has one of
the lowest neutron star masses measured to date. From evolutionary
considerations it seems likely that the companion star, despite its high mass,
was formed in an electron-capture supernova.

These sound waves form a structure that can account for the ripples observed in

slow in the sense that they are highly sub-relativistic, $v_j \sim 0.01c-0.1c$,
