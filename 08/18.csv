gauge group in F-theory compactifications by turning on certain U(1) fluxes. We
show that the requirement of massless hypercharge is equivalent to a
topological constraint on the UV completion of the local model. The possibility
of this mechanism is intrinsic to F-theory. We address some of the
phenomenological signatures of this scenario. We show that our models predict
monopoles as in conventional GUT models. We discuss in detail the leading
threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic terms and their effect on
unification. They turn out to be related to Ray-Singer torsion. We also discuss
the issue of proton decay in F-theory models and explain how to engineer models
which satisfy current experimental bounds.

and some kind of wind or jet-like outflow. Recent work by Matt and Pudritz has
suggested that if classical T Tauri stars exhibit stellar winds with mass loss
rates about 0.1 times their accretion rates, the wind can carry away enough
angular momentum to keep the stars from being spun up unrealistically by
accretion. This paper presents a preliminary set of theoretical models of
accretion-driven winds from the polar regions of T Tauri stars. These models
are based on recently published self-consistent simulations of the Sun's
coronal heating and wind acceleration. In addition to the convection-driven MHD
turbulence (which dominates in the solar case), we add another source of wave
energy at the photosphere that is driven by the impact of plasma in neighboring
flux tubes undergoing magnetospheric accretion. This added energy, determined
quantitatively from the far-field theory of MHD wave generation, is sufficient
to produce T Tauri-like mass loss rates of at least 0.01 times the accretion
rate. While still about an order of magnitude below the level required for
efficient angular momentum removal, these are the first self-consistent models
of T Tauri winds that agree reasonably well with a range of observational mass
loss constraints. The youngest modeled stellar winds are supported by Alfven
wave pressure, they have low temperatures (""extended chromospheres""), and they
are likely to be unstable to the formation of counterpropagating shocks and
clumps far from the star.

and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding
issues in cosmology: the origin of the baryon asymmetry and the source of dark
matter. In the MSSM, weak scale generation of the baryon asymmetry may be
achieved in the presence of light stops, with masses lower than about 130 GeV.
Moreover, the proper dark matter density may be obtained in the stop-neutralino
co-annihilation region, where the stop-neutralino mass difference is smaller
than a few tens of GeV. Searches for scalar top quarks (stops) in pair
production processes at the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
become very challenging in this region of parameters. At the LHC, however,
light stops proceeding from the decay of gluino pairs may be identified,
provided the gluino mass is smaller than about 900 GeV. In this article we
propose an alternative method for stop searches in the co-annihilation region,
based on the search for these particles in events with missing energy plus one
hard photon or jet. We show that this method is quite efficient and, when
complemented with ongoing Tevatron searches, allows to probe stop masses up to
about 160 GeV, fully probing the region of parameters consistent with
electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM.

parameters vary linearly with the pulse width, our scheme allows flexibility in
the time scales under which qubits evolve. Unlike quantum spin networks, our
scheme allows the transmission of several quantum states at a time, requiring
only a two qubit separation between quantum states. By pulsing the biases of
several qubits at the same time, we show that only eight bias control lines are
required to achieve state transfer along a channel of arbitrary length.
Furthermore, when the information to be transferred is purely classical in

support of kG/I must be contained in a certain finite union of rational linear
subspaces of Spec gr kG. The minimal codimension of these subspaces gives a
lower bound on the homological height of I in terms of the action of a certain
Lie algebra on G/G^p. If we take Gamma to be G acting on itself by conjugation,
then Gamma-invariant right ideals of kG are precisely the two-sided ideals of
kG, and we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the homological height of a
possible non-zero two-sided ideal. For example, when G is open in SL_n(\Zp)
this lower bound equals 2n - 2. This gives a significant improvement of the
results of Ardakov, Wei and Zhang on reflexive ideals in Iwasawa algebras.

clusters based on hydrodynamic N-body simulations of structure formation. We
have simulated five dust models plus a radiative cooling and adiabatic models
using the same initial conditions for all runs. The numerical implementation of
dust was based on the analytical computations of Montier and Giard (2004). We
set up dust simulations to cover different combinations of dust parameters that
put in evidence the effects of size and abundance of dust grains. Comparing our
radiative plus dust cooling runs to a purely radiative cooling simulation we
find that dust has an impact on cluster scaling relations. It mainly affects
the normalisation of the scalings (and their evolution), whereas it introduces
no significant differences on their slopes. The strength of the effect depends
critically on the dust abundance and grain size parameters as well as on the
cluster scaling. Indeed, cooling due to dust is effective at the cluster regime
and has a stronger effect on the ""baryon driven"" statistical properties of
clusters such as $L_{\rm X}-M$, $Y- M$, $S-M$ scaling relations. Major
differences, relative to the radiative cooling model, are as high as 25% for
the $L_{\rm X}-M$ normalisation, and about 10% for the $Y-M$ and $S-M$
normalisations at redshift zero. On the other hand, we find that dust has
almost no impact on the ""dark matter driven"" $T_{\rm mw}-M$ scaling relation.
The effects are found to be dependent in equal parts on both dust abundances
and grain sizes distributions for the scalings investigated in this paper.
Higher dust abundances and smaller grain sizes cause larger departures from the
radiative cooling (i.e. with no dust) model.

acting on a small particle orbiting a larger black hole. In this method, one
first computes the spherical-harmonic $l$-mode contributions $F^{\mu}_l$ of the
""full force"" field $F^{\mu}$, evaluated at the particle's location, and then
sums over $l$ subject to a certain regularization procedure. In the
frequency-domain variant of this scheme the quantities $F^{\mu}_l$ are obtained
by fully decomposing the particle's self field into Fourier-harmonic modes $l m
\omega$, calculating the contribution of each such mode to $F^{\mu}_l$, and
then summing over $\omega$ and $m$ for given $l$. This procedure has the
advantage that one only encounters {\it ordinary} differential equations.
However, for eccentric orbits, the sum over $\omega$ is found to converge badly
at the particle's location. This problem (reminiscent of the familiar Gibbs
phenomenon) results from the discontinuity of the time-domain $F^{\mu}_l$ field
at the particle's worldline. Here we propose a simple and practical method to
resolve this problem. The method utilizes the {\it homogeneous} modes $l m
\omega$ of the self field to construct $F^{\mu}_l$ (rather than the
inhomogeneous modes, as in the standard method), which guarantees an
exponentially-fast convergence to the correct value of $F^{\mu}_l$, even at the
particle's location. We illustrate the application of the method with the
example of the monopole scalar-field perturbation from a scalar charge in an
eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our method, however, should
be applicable to a wider range of problems, including the calculation of the
gravitational self-force using either Teukolsky's formalism, or a direct
integration of the metric perturbation equations.

multi-wavelength polarimetric data and speckle reconstructed time series of
continuum images were used to determine proper motions, as well as the velocity

reveals apparent lateral motions of bright and dark structures inside bright

limbward side and weak downflows on their centerward side. The magnetic field
in them is significantly weaker and more horizontal than in the adjacent dark

rolls in filaments with a nearly horizontal magnetic field. These are separated
by filaments harbouring stronger, more vertical fields. Because of reduced gas
pressure, we see deeper into the latter. When observed near the limb, the
disk-centerward side of the horizontal-field filaments appear bright due to the

is investigated by linear analysis and two-dimensional nonlinear simulations.
The linear growth of the viscous MRI is characterized by the Reynolds number
defined as $R_{\rm MRI} \equiv v_A^2/\nu\Omega $, where $v_A$ is the Alfv{\'e}n
velocity, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\Omega$ is the angular
velocity of the disk. Although the linear growth rate is suppressed
considerably as the Reynolds number decreases, the nonlinear behavior is found
to be almost independent of $R_{\rm MRI}$. At the nonlinear evolutionary stage,
a two-channel flow continues growing and the Maxwell stress increases until the
end of calculations even though the Reynolds number is much smaller than unity.
A large portion of the injected energy to the system is converted to the
magnetic energy. The gain rate of the thermal energy, on the other hand, is
found to be much larger than the viscous heating rate. Nonlinear behavior of
the MRI in the viscous regime and its difference from that in the highly
resistive regime can be explained schematically by using the characteristics of
the linear dispersion relation. Applying our results to the case with both the
viscosity and resistivity, it is anticipated that the critical value of the
Lundquist number $S_{\rm MRI} \equiv v_A^2/\eta\Omega$ for active turbulence
depends on the magnetic Prandtl number $S_{{\rm MRI},c} \propto Pm^{1/2}$ in
the regime of $Pm \gg 1$ and remains constant when $Pm \ll 1$, where $Pm \equiv
S_{\rm MRI}/R_{\rm MRI} = \nu/\eta$ and $\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity.

diffuse emission and high-quality spectra. The spectra revealed that the
diffuse emission is comprised of thermal and non-thermal components. The
thermal component can be represented by an NEI model with a temperature, a
pre-shock electron density and an age of 0.9(0.7-1.1) keV, 0.4(0.3-0.5) cm^{-3}
and 650(350-3150) yr, respectively. This suggests that the explosion of CTB37B
occurred in a low-density space. A non-thermal power-law component was found
from the southern region of CTB37B. Its photon index of ~1.5 and a high
roll-off energy (>15 keV) indicate efficient cosmic-ray acceleration. A
comparison of this X-ray spectrum with the TeV gamma-ray spectrum leads us to
conclude that the TeV gamma-ray emission seems to be powered by either
multi-zone Inverse Compton scattering or the decay of neutral pions. The point
source resolved by Chandra near the shell is probably associated with CTB37B,
because of the common hydrogen column density with the diffuse thermal
emission. Spectral and temporal characteristics suggest that this source is a
new anomalous X-ray pulsar.

continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). Due to the translational
invariance of neuronal recurrent interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous
family of stationary states. They form a continuous manifold in which the
neural system is neutrally stable. We systematically explore how this property
facilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which is believed to have clear
correspondence with brain functions. By using the wave functions of the quantum
harmonic oscillator as the basis, we demonstrate how the dynamics of a CANN is
decomposed into different motion modes, corresponding to distortions in the
amplitude, position, width or skewness of the network state. We then develop a
perturbative approach that utilizes the dominating movement of the network's
stationary states in the state space. This method allows us to approximate the
network dynamics up to an arbitrary accuracy depending on the order of
perturbation used. We quantify the distortions of a Gaussian bump during
tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are
obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable and the
reaction time for the network to catch up with an abrupt change in the
stimulus.

ubiquitous feature of physical and chemical reaction systems. In configurations
containing confining walls or constrictions transport is controlled both by the
fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available
to their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and
nanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. With this
survey we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical
investigation of stochastic transport occurring either in micro-sized
geometries of varying cross section or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing
particles are hindered from passing each other (single file diffusion). For
particles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by
confining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as (i) a
decrease of nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or, also, (ii) a
broad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit.
These paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions
resulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the
suspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing,
rectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes
possible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels
gets modified via contact particle-particle interactions, which induce
anomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven
single file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the
confining coupling constant.

which leads to an enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy. The van Hove
singularity originates from a higher order valence instability at the L-point
in the electronic structure. The enhanced density of states at the Fermi level
was confirmed by specific heat and susceptibility measurements. Although many

significantly detected IGR J17098-3628 only when the source was in this dubbed

March 2005, lasting for $\sim$5 days with detection significance of 73$\sigma$

that the soft X-ray lightcurve shows a similar outburst to that detected by
INTEGRAL, however the peak of the soft X-ray lightcurve either lags, or is
preceded by, the hard X-ray ($>$20 keV) outburst by $\sim$2 days. This

suggests a LMXB nature for IGR J17098-3628. While the quality of the ASM data

formulation will involve a two dimensional variational problem. The
dislocations are introduced as point topological defects of the strain fields,
for which we compute the elastic energy stored outside the so called core

number of dislocations tends to infinity of this energy (suitably rescaled),
takes the form $$ E= \int_{\Om} (W(\beta^e) + \f (\Curl \beta^e)) dx, $$ where
$\beta^e$ represents the elastic part of the macroscopic strain, and $\Curl
\beta^e$ represents the geometrically necessary dislocation density. The
plastic energy density $\f$ is defined explicitly through an asymptotic cell

positively 1-homogeneous, so that concentration on lines is permitted,

the exclusive possibility of tiling the focal plane of wide-field 4-m

of ~6 million galaxies over a wide redshift range and thus may provide a

smaller than the clone square subfield so that the clones can be tightly packed
with little gaps between the contiguous fields. Only low cost glasses are used;
the variations in chromatic aberrations between bands are compensated by
changing one or two of the lenses adjacent to the grism. The total weight and

these galaxies in the mid-IR (12um), optical ([O III]) and hard X-ray (2-10
keV), we show that they are all under-luminous in the 2-10 keV X-ray band. Four
of the objects exhibit X-ray spectra indicative of a hard excess, consistent
with a heavily obscured X-ray component and hence a hidden nucleus. In these
objects the softer X-rays may be dominated by a strong soft scattered continuum
or contamination from the host galaxy, which is responsible for the unabsorbed
X-ray spectra observed, and accounts for the anomalously low 2-10 keV X-ray
luminosity. We confirm this assertion in NGC4501 with a Chandra observation,
which shows hard X-ray emission coincident with the nucleus, consistent with
heavy absorption, and a number of contaminating softer sources which account
for the bulk of the softer emission. We point out that such 'Compton thick'
sources need not necessarily present iron Ka emission of high EW. An example in
our sample is IRASF01475-0740, which we know must host an obscured AGN as it
hosts a HBLR seen in scattered light (Tran 2003). The X-ray spectrum is
nonetheless relatively unobscured and the iron Ka line only moderate in
strength. These observations can be reconciled if the hidden nuclear emission
is dominated by transmitted, rather than reflected X-rays, which can then be
weak compared to the soft scattered light or galactic emission. Despite these
considerations, we conclude that NGC3147 & 3660 may intrinsically lack a BLR,
confirming the recent results of Bianchi et al. (2008) for NGC3147. Neither
X-ray spectrum shows signs of hidden hard emission and both sources exhibit
X-ray variability leading us to believe we are viewing the nucleus directly.

variation <10 m/s, which is less than the errors of the RV measurements
discussed in an earlier publication. The analysis of new optical RV data, with
typical errors of 10 m/s, shows a larger RV amplitude that varies depending on
the correlation mask used. A slight correlation between the RV variation and
the bisector is also observed, although not at a very significant level. The
infrared H-band RV curve is almost flat, showing a small variation (<35 m/s)

in nature such as atmospheric flows, heartbeat patterns, population dynamics,
etc. The physics of the long-range correlations intrinsic to fractal
fluctuations is not yet identified. It is important to quantify the physics
underlying the irregular fractal fluctuations for predictability studies. A
general systems theory for fractals visualizes the emergence of successively
larger scale fluctuations to result from the space-time integration of enclosed
smaller scale fluctuations. The model predictions are as follows. The
probability distribution and the power spectrum for fractal fluctuations is the
same inverse power law function incorporating the golden mean. The predicted
distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations
but exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability
of occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power
(variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the
probability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or
photon, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. The fine structure
constant for spectrum of fractal fluctuations is a function of the golden mean
and is analogous to atomic spectra equal to about 1/137. Global gridded time
series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880 - 2007/2008
are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit
distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The
model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability
rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures. Global
warming results in intensification of fluctuations of all scales and manifested
immediately in high frequency fluctuations.

emission is unresolved, with a size $< 1""$, or a physical size $< 8$kpc. The
total star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$
$M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-FIR correlation in low redshift star
forming galaxies. The star formation rate derived from a similar analysis of
the UV luminosities is 17 $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for UV
dust attenuation. The simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factor
is 1.8 at UV wavelengths. However, this factor is considerably smaller than the
standard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for LBGs. We discuss
potential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dust
attenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. Conversely,
the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematically
lower at very high redshift. Two possible causes for a suppressed radio
luminosity are: (i) increased inverse Compton cooling of the relativistic
electron population due to scattering off the increasing CMB at high redshift,
or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. The radio
detections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud AGN fraction
of 0.3%. One source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a
'submm galaxy').

quantum dot, are investigated within the rotating wave approximation. The
electron current through the dot induces an out of equilibrium bath, with a
phonon distribution qualitatively different from the thermal one. In selected
transport regimes, such a distribution is characterized by a peculiar selective
population of few phonon modes and can exhibit a sub-Poissonian behavior. It is
shown that such a sub-Poissonian behavior is favored by a double occupancy of
the dot. The crossover from a unequilibrated to a conventional thermal bath is
explored, and the limitations of the rotating wave approximation are discussed.

revolutionary advances in cosmology. Future experiments to detect the very weak
B mode signal in CMB polarization maps will require unprecedented sensitivity
and control of systematic errors. Bolometric interferometry may provide a way
to achieve these goals. In a bolometric interferometer (or other adding
interferometer), phase shift sequences are applied to the inputs in order to
recover the visibilities. Noise is minimized when the phase shift sequences
corresponding to all visibilities are orthogonal. We present a systematic
method for finding sequences that produce this orthogonality, approximately
minimizing both the length of the time sequence and the number of discrete
phase shift values required. When some baselines are geometrically equivalent,
we can choose sequences that read out those baselines simultaneously, which has
been shown to improve signal to noise ratio.

function of redshift and compare this with the X-ray luminosity. This can
potentially constrain the origin of the infrared emission to be intracluster
dust and/or dust heated by star formation in the cluster galaxies. We perform a
statistical analysis of a large sample of galaxy clusters selected from
existing databases and catalogues.We coadd the infrared IRAS and X-ray RASS
images in the direction of the selected clusters within successive redshift
intervals up to z = 1. We find that the total infrared luminosity is very high
and on average 20 times higher than the X-ray luminosity. If all the infrared
luminosity is to be attributed to emission from diffuse intracluster dust, then
the IR to X-ray ratio implies a dust-to-gas mass abundance of 5e-4. However,
the infrared luminosity shows a strong enhancement for 0.1 < z < 1, which
cannot be attributed to cluster selection effects. We show that this
enhancement is compatible with a star formation rate in the member galaxies
that is typical of the central Mpc of the Coma cluster at z = 0 and evolves
with the redshift as (1+z)^5. It is likely that most of the infrared luminosity
that we measure is generated by the ongoing star formation in the member
galaxies. From theoretical predictions calibrated on extinction measurements
(dust mass abundance equal to 1e-5), we expect only a minor contribution, of a
few percent, from intracluster dust.

systems with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) anisotropic antisymmetric interaction.
By applying the explanations of heat transferred and work performed at the
quantum level in Kieu's work [PRL, 93, 140403 (2004)], the basic thermodynamic
quantities, i.e., heat transferred, net work done in a cycle and efficiency of
EQHE are investigated in terms of DM interaction and concurrence. The validity
of the second law of thermodynamics is confirmed in the entangled system. It is
found that there is a same efficiency for both antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic cases, and the efficiency can be controlled in two manners: 1.
only by spin-spin interaction J and DM interaction D; 2. only by the
temperature T and concurrence C. In order to obtain a positive net work, we
need not entangle all qubits in two two-spin systems and we only require the
entanglement between qubits in a two-spin system not be zero. As the ratio of
entanglement between qubits in two two-spin systems increases, the efficiency
will approach infinitely the classical Carnot one. An interesting phenomenon is
an abrupt transition of the efficiency when the entanglements between qubits in
two two-spin systems are equal.

force systems, but our interpretation is different: in our case relaxation is
due to localised excitations which propagate through the system; these
localised excitations act as background disorder for the elastic network,
giving rise to anomalous vibrational modes. Our results show that a correlation
between spatially extended low frequency modes and high propensity regions does
not imply that relaxational dynamics originates in extended soft modes. We
consider other measures of elastic heterogeneity, such as non-affine
displacement fields and mode localisation lengths, and discuss implications of
our results to interpretations of dynamic heterogeneity more generally.
