collider experiments. We introduce a factorization formalism that can be
applied to any desired observable, like event shapes or jet observables, for
any number of jets and a wide range of jet algorithms in leptonic or hadronic
collisions. This is achieved by using soft-collinear effective theory to prove
the formal factorization of a generic fully-differential cross section in terms
of a hard coefficient, and generic jet and soft functions. In this formalism,
whether a given observable factorizes in the usual sense, depends on whether it
is inclusive enough, so the jet functions can be calculated perturbatively. The
factorization formula for any such observable immediately follows from our
general result, including the precise definition of the jet and soft functions
appropriate for the observable in question. As examples of our formalism, we
work out several results in two-jet production for both e+e- and pp collisions.
For the latter, we also comment on how our formalism allows one to treat
underlying events and beam remnants.

extremely luminous Type II supernova (SN) 2008es. With an observed peak optical
magnitude of m_V = 17.8 and at a redshift z = 0.213, SN 2008es had a peak
absolute magnitude of M_V = -22.3, making it the second most luminous SN ever
observed. The photometric evolution of SN 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate
(~0.042 mag d^-1), similar to the extremely luminous Type II-L SN 2005ap. We
show that SN 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous Type II-L SN
1979C. Although the spectra of SN 2008es lack the narrow and intermediate-width
line emission typically associated with the interaction of a SN with the
circumstellar medium of its progenitor star, we argue that the extreme
luminosity of SN 2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense,
optically thick circumstellar medium. The integrated bolometric luminosity of
SN 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths
of >10^51 ergs. Finally, we examine the apparently anomalous rate at which the
Texas Supernova Search has discovered rare kinds of supernovae, including the
five most luminous supernovae observed to date, and find that their results are
consistent with those of other modern SN searches.

At the
same time, in WIMPless models with hidden matter masses proportional to hidden
gauge couplings squared, the hidden dark matter's thermal relic density may
naturally be in the right range, preserving the key quantitative virtue of
WIMPs. We consider this possibility in detail. We first determine
model-independent constraints on hidden sectors from Big Bang nucleosynthesis
and the cosmic microwave background. Contrary to conventional wisdom, large
hidden sectors are easily accommodated. A flavour-free version of the standard
model is allowed if the hidden sector is just 30% colder than the observable
sector after reheating. Alternatively, if the hidden sector contains a
1-generation version of the standard model with characteristic mass scale below
1 MeV, even identical reheating temperatures are allowed. We then analyze
hidden sector freezeout in detail for a concrete model, solving the Boltzmann
equation numerically and understanding the results from both observable and
hidden sector points of view. We find that WIMPless dark matter indeed obtains
the correct relic density for masses in the range keV < m_X < TeV. The upper
bound results from the requirement of perturbativity, and the lower bound
assumes that the observable and hidden sectors reheat to the same temperature
and is raised to the MeV scale if the hidden sector is 10 times colder.
WIMPless dark matter therefore generalizes the WIMP paradigm to the largest
mass range possible for viable thermal relics and provides a unified framework
for exploring dark matter signals across nine orders of magnitude in dark
matter mass.

dramatic examples of AGN-driven winds. The high absorbing columns in these
winds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that BALQSOs are generally X-ray faint. This high
X-ray absorption means that almost all BALQSOs have been discovered through
optical surveys, and so what little we know about their X-ray properties is
derived from very bright optically-selected sources. A small number of X-ray
selected BALQSOs (XBALQSOs) have, however, recently been found in deep X-ray
survey fields. In this paper we investigate the X-ray and rest-frame UV
properties of five XBALQSOs for which we have obtained XMM-Newton EPIC X-ray
spectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. We find that, although the
XBALQSOs have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal QSOs, their median
alpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample of
optically selected BALQSOs (OBALQSOs). We rule out the possibility that the
higher X-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. We
find that the amount of X-ray and UV absorption due to the wind in XBALQSOs is
similar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption in
OBALQSOs, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.
We conclude that these XBALQSOs have intrinsically higher X-ray to optical flux
ratios than the OBALQSO sample with which we compare them.

oscillations of the electromagnetic field, which depends upon the film optical
properties and, in case of deposition onto a substrate, upon the substrate
reflectivity. It has been suggested that this force may be relevant in
determining the stability of deposited pseudomorphic films with respect to
buckling or island formation. We present a detailed analysis of its behaviour
as a function of the optical parameters and of the film thickness and we
illustrate the conditions under which it may play some role. For free standing
films it turns out that the film stabilization is basically due to the surface
stress, which largely overwhelms the vacuum force. For epilayers on metal
substrate the vacuum force may be important, and we give stability diagrams and
critical thicknesses for several cases, illustrating how the flat surface
growth may depend upon the film parameters. The importance of including
retardation effects into the theory for a realistic determination of the
stability conditions is also discussed.

been studied as a natural framework for the description of globular clusters.
Here we consider the construction of self-consistent models under the same
physical conditions, but including explicitly the ingredients that lead to
departures from spherical symmetry. In particular, we focus on the effects of
the tidal field associated with the hosting galaxy. We then take a stellar
system on a circular orbit inside a galaxy represented as a ""frozen"" external
field. The equilibrium distribution function is obtained from the one
describing the spherical case by replacing the energy integral with the
relevant Jacobi integral in the presence of the external tidal field. Then the
construction of the model requires the investigation of a singular perturbation
problem for an elliptic partial differential equation with a free boundary, for
which we provide a method of solution to any desired order, with explicit
solutions to two orders. We outline the relevant parameter space, thus opening
the way to a systematic study of the properties of a two-parameter family of
physically justified non-spherical models of quasi-relaxed stellar systems. The
general method developed here can also be used to construct models for which
the non-spherical shape is due to internal rotation. Eventually, the models
will be a useful tool to investigate whether the shapes of globular clusters
are primarily determined by internal rotation, by external tides, or by
pressure anisotropy.

scan, leading to an inefficient and incomplete coverage of the parameter space.
We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is well suited to
multi-parameter determination. Its specificities (burn-in length, acceptance,
and correlation length) are discussed in the phenomenologically well-understood
Leaky-Box Model. From a technical point of view, a trial function based on
binary-space partitioning is found to be extremely efficient, allowing a
simultaneous determination of up to nine parameters, including transport and
source parameters, such as slope and abundances. Our best-fit model includes
both a low energy cut-off and reacceleration, whose values are consistent with
those found in diffusion models. A Kolmogorov spectrum for the diffusion slope
(delta=1/3) is excluded. The marginalised probability-density function for
delta and alpha (the slope of the source spectra) are delta~0.55-0.60 and
alpha~2.14-2.17, depending on the dataset used and the number of free

are positively correlated among themselves and with the reacceleration
strength, but are negatively correlated with the other propagation parameters.

of extremely red stellar objects extracted from the point-source catalogue of
the INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) of the northern galactic plane. The
vast majority of these objects have no previous identification. Analysis of
optical, near- and mid-infrared photometry reveals that they are mostly
highly-reddened asymptotic giant branch stars, with significant levels of
circumstellar material. We show that the distribution of these objects traces
galactic extinction, their highly reddened colours being a product of both
interstellar and circumstellar reddening. This is the first time that such a
large sample of evolved low-mass stars has been detected in the visual and
allows optical counterparts to be associated with sources from recent infrared
surveys.
  Follow-up spectroscopy on some of the most interesting objects in the sample
has found significant numbers of S-type stars which can be clearly separated
from oxygen-rich objects in the IPHAS colour-colour diagram. We show that this
is due to the positions of different molecular bands relative to the
narrow-band H-alpha filter used for IPHAS observations. The IPHAS (r' -
H-alpha) colour offers a valuable diagnostic for identifying S-type stars. A
selection method for identifying S-type stars in the galactic plane is briefly
discussed and we estimate that over a thousand new objects of this type may be
discovered, potentially doubling the number of known objects in this short but
important evolutionary phase.

the case with multiple piercings are obtained numerically and agree with the
theoretical prediction. In the case of a two dimensional parabolic quantum dot
with two electrons and a single piercing in the origin we show that the energy
of the ground state calculated to first order in perturbation theory goes over
to the equivalent result in absence of piercing as the radius of the piercing
becomes infinitesimal. Interestingly, we find that the leading finite size
correction to the interaction energy is negative while the corresponding
correction to the single particle energies is (as expected) positive. For a
finite radius of the piercing and above a critical coupling, the first term
dominates the second and the total energy of the dot with piercing is lower.
Unfortunately the critical coupling found for this example is nonperturbative.
Finally we study configurations allowing bound states in the continuum, showing
that bound states survive to the insertion of piercings and that their energy
is unchanged when the radius of the piercing vanishes.

arbitrary constant deceleration parameter. Our construction uses the operator
formalism, by integrating the Fourier mode sum. We give special attention to
infrared corrections from the nonzero lower limit associated with working on
finite spatial sections. These corrections eliminate infrared divergences that
would otherwise be incorrectly treated by dimensional regularization, resulting
in off-coincidence divergences for those special values of the deceleration

compute the expectation value of the scalar stress-energy tensor.

demonstrate that D3-instantons which wrap the same 4-cycle as one of the

important scales, including the supersymmetry-breaking scale and the
right-handed neutrino mass. Furthermore, these instantons seem unable to
directly generate the \mu term suggesting that, at least in this class of

to the superpotential. This allows one to formulate topological conditions
which must be imposed on \Sigma for various model-building applications. Along
the way, we also observe that the construction of arXiv:0808.1286 which

to date. Broadband photometry with IRAC (3-10 micron), IRS (16 micron), and
MIPS (24, 70 & 160 micron) was obtained as well as IRS spectroscopy spanning
5.5-35 microns. A fit of stellar population models to the optical/near-IR/IRAC
photometry gives a young age (~9 Myr), forming stars at ~98 M_sun/yr, with a
total stellar mass of ~10^9 M_sun formed thus far. The existence of an old
stellar population with twice the stellar mass can not be ruled out. IR
spectral energy distribution fits to the 24 and 70 micron photometry, as well
as previously obtained submm/mm, data give an intrinsic IR luminosity L_IR =
1-2 x10^11 L_sun and a star formation rate, SFR ~20-40 M_sun/yr. The UV derived
star formation rate (SFR) is ~3-5 times higher than the SFR determined using
L_IR or L_Halpha because the red UV spectral slope is significantly over

Calzetti starburst obscuration law may not be valid for young LBGs. We detect
strong line emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 6.2, 7.7,

clarifying the relationship between DLAs and absorbers selected via strong CaII
lines, and (ii) increasing the still limited sample of Zn and Cr abundances in
this redshift range. We find only partial overlap between current samples of
intermediate-z DLAs (which are drawn from magnitude limited surveys) and strong
CaII absorbers: approximately 25% of known DLAs at these redshifts have an
associated CaII 3935 line with REW>0.35A, the threshold of the SDSS sample
assembled by Wild and her collaborators. The lack of the strongest systems
(with REW>0.5A) is consistent with these authors' conclusion that such
absorbers are often missed in current DLA surveys because they redden/dim the
light of the background QSOs. We rule out the suggestion that strong CaII
absorption is associated exclusively with the highest-N(HI) DLAs. Furthermore,
we find no correlation between the strength of the CaII lines and either the
metallicity or depletion, although the strongest CaII absorber in our sample is
also the most metal-rich DLA yet discovered, with [Zn/H] ~ solar. We conclude
that a complex mix of parameters determine the strengths of the CaII lines,
including the density of particles and UV photons in the ISM of the galaxies
hosting the DLAs. We find tentative evidence (given the small size of our
sample) that strong CaII systems may preferentially sample regions of high gas
density, perhaps akin to the DLAs exhibiting molecular hydrogen absorption at
redshifts z>2. If this connection is confirmed, strong CaII absorbers would
trace possibly metal-rich, H2-bearing columns of cool, dense gas at distances
up to tens of kpc from normal galaxies. (abridged)

similar trends. We present a fitting form for this environmental dependence

adaptive mesh refinement, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and
cosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the escape

halo mass, escape fractions can vary up to a factor of two, depending on the
initial setup of the idealized halo. In a cosmological setting, we find that
the time-averaged photon escape fraction always exceeds 25% and reaches up to
80% in halos with masses above 10^8 solar masses with a top-heavy IMF. The
instantaneous escape fraction can vary up to an order of magnitude in a few
million years and tend to be positively correlated with star formation rate. We
find that the mean of the star formation efficiency times ionizing photon
escape fraction, averaged over all atomic cooling (T_vir > 8000 K) galaxies,
ranges from 0.02 for a normal IMF to 0.03 for a top-heavy IMF, whereas smaller,
molecular cooling galaxies in minihalos do not make a significant contribution

Eguchi--Kawai reduction) in the large $N$ limit. This equivalence, may open new

remain an open question, and in this paper we propose a model which could
explain sudden jet deceleration, invoking density discontinuities. This is
particularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high
resolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low
energy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density
environment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be
lost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a
transition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain
so on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic
hydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state
introduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present
results for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to
20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for
cylindrical versus conical jet models. As long as the jet propagates through
uniform media, we find that the density contrast sets most of the propagation
characteristics, fully consistent with previous modeling efforts. When the jet
runs into a denser medium, we find a clear distinction in the decelaration of
high energy jets depending on the encountered density jump. For fairly high
density contrast, the jet becomes destabilised and compressed, decelerates
strongly (up to subrelativistic speeds) and can form knots. We point out
differences that are found between cylindrical and conical jet models, together
with dynamical details like the Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities developing at

various selection and modelling biases, whch we aim to investigate in a

efficient pipeline to simulate lensing by realistic galaxy models. These galaxy
models have separate stellar and dark matter components, each with a range of
density profiles and shapes representative of early-type, central galaxies
without significant contributions from other nearby galaxies. We use Fourier
methods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surface
density distributions, and Monte Carlo methods to compute lensing statistics
such as point-source lensing cross-sections. Incorporating a variety of
magnification bias modes lets us examine different survey limitations in image
resolution and flux. We rigorously test the numerical methods for systematic
errors and sensitivity to basic assumptions. We also determine the minimum
number of viewing angles that must be sampled in order to recover accurate
orientation-averaged lensing quantities. We find that for a range of
non-isothermal stellar and dark matter density profiles typical of elliptical
galaxies, the combined density profile and corresponding lensing properties are
surprisingly close to isothermal around the Einstein radius. The converse
implication is that constraints from strong lensing and/or stellar kinematics,
which are indeed consistent with isothermal models near the Einstein radius,
cannot trivially be extrapolated to smaller and larger radii.

of strong gravitational lens systems to draw conclusions about galaxy mass
distributions. We use a new strong lensing pipeline (presented in Paper I of
this series) to explore selection biases that may cause the population of
strong lensing systems to differ from the general galaxy population. Our focus
is on point-source lensing by early-type galaxies with two mass components
(stellar and dark matter) that have a variety of density profiles and shapes
motivated by observational and theoretical studies of galaxy properties. We
seek not only to quantify but also to understand the physics behind selection
biases related to: galaxy mass, orientation and shape; dark matter profile
parameters such as inner slope and concentration; and adiabatic contraction. We
study how all of these properties affect the lensing Einstein radius, total
cross-section, quad/double ratio, and image separation distribution. We find
significant (factors of several) selection biases with mass; orientation, for a
given galaxy shape at fixed mass; cusped dark matter profile inner slope and
concentration; concentration of the stellar and dark matter deprojected Sersic
models. Interestingly, the intrinsic shape of a galaxy does not strongly
influence its lensing cross-section when we average over viewing angles. Our
results are an important first step towards understanding how strong lens
systems relate to the general galaxy population.

informatics is a potentially promising possibility which is the way how
biological brains process the information. Recently, it has been shown that
thermal noise and its electronically enhanced versions (Johnson-like noises)
can be utilized as information carrier with peculiar properties. Relevant
examples are Zero power (stealth) communication, Unconditionally secure
communication with Johnson(-like) noise and Kirchhoff loop and Noise-driven
computing. The zero power communication utilizes the equilibrium background
noise in the channel to transfer information. The unconditionally secure
communication is based on the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a
simple Kirchhoff's loop. The scheme utilizes on the robustness of classical
information and the second law of thermodynamics. It uncovers active
eavesdropping within a single clock period (no error statistics is required)
and it is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. Further
advantages of the scheme is that the circuitry can easily be integrated on
computer chips, unconditionally secure computer processors, memories and other
hardware can be realized.

supersymmetry. These latter vacua can be analyzed by using SUSY/non-SUSY
duality which is recently proposed by Aganagic, Beem, Seo and Vafa. A dual
description of these in UV is U(N) gauge theory where the supersymmetry is
broken by spurion superfields. Following them, we see that there are
supersymmetry preserving vacua as well as supersymmetry breaking vacua of low
energy effective theory.

into the central galaxy (Min), then we can predict that a maximum $\sim 19%$

of the diffused intra-cluster component. In the former case, in massive halos
with $M_h \sim 10^{15} \msunh$, the stellar mass of the intra-cluster component

decreases to $\sim 2$, 1 and 0.1 in halos with $M_h \sim 10^{14}$, $10^{13}$,

occur in halos with higher masses. Abridged.

2MASS (24.5 mag arcsec^-2 < sb_lim < 26 mag arcsec ^-2) have been obtained with
IRIS2 on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope. A total of 22 galaxies that
remained previously undetected in the near-IR and potentially could have been
genuinely young galaxies were found to have an old stellar population with a
star density 1-2 magnitudes below the 2MASS detection threshold. The cleaned
near-IR images reveal the morphology and extent of many of the galaxies for the
first time. For all program galaxies, we derive radial luminosity profiles,
ellipticities, and position angles, together with global parameters such as
total magnitude, mean effective surface brightness and half-light radius. Our
results show that 2MASS underestimates the total magnitude of galaxies with
<mu_H>_eff between 18-21 mag arcsec^-2 by up to 2.5 mag. The Sersic parameters
best describing the observed surface brightness profiles are also presented.
Adopting accurate galaxy distances and a H-band mass-to-light ratio of
Upsilon_H=1.0 +/- 0.4, the LSI galaxies are found to cover a stellar mass range
of 5.6 < log_10 (M_stars) < 11.1. The results are discussed along with

packet arrivals. There are constraints on which queues can be served
simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances
like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for
congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling
is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation
makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing
work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness.
As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing
an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are
candidates and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities. We then
obtain a scheduling algorithm that achieves the described notion of fairness by
drawing upon the seminal work of Goodman and Markowitz (1952). This yields the
familiar Maximum Weight (MW) style algorithm. As another important result we
prove that algorithm obtained is throughput optimal. There is no reason a

pixels and has a single photon level sensitivity. Since then, various types of
the sensor with this scheme, Pixelized Photon Detectors (PPD), have been
developed in many places in the world. For instance, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.

The probabilistic behavior of such a flaky quantiser is explained as the
deterministic dynamics of the multi-valued R\'enyi map. That is, a sample $x$

of $x$ are performed using $\beta$-expansion even if $\nu$ may vary at each
iteration. This viewpoint enables us to get the decoded sample, which is equal
to the midpoint of the subinterval, and its associated characteristic equation
for recovering $\beta$ which improves the quantisation error by more than
$3{dB}$ when $\beta>1.5$. The invariant subinterval under the R\'enyi map shows
that $\nu$ should be set to around the midpoint of its associated greedy and
lazy values. %in terms of its quantisation MSE (mean square error).
Furthermore, a new A/D converter is introduced called the negative

the WIM are decoupled, and that the filling factor of WIM clouds is a geometric
response to the competing environmental influences of thermal and non-thermal
processes. Extrapolating the properties of the thick-disk WIM to mid-plane, we
infer a volume-averaged electron density 0.014 +- 0.001 cm^-3, produced by
clouds of typical electron density 0.34 +- 0.06 cm^-3 with a volume filling
factor 0.04 +- 0.01. As one moves off the plane, the filling factor increases

declining to accommodate the increasing presence of hot, coronal gas. Since

as well as for linear parameter-varying (LPV) plants (where the controller has
on-line access to the varying plant parameters) is through
linear-fractional-transformation (LFT) models. Control issues to be addressed
by controller design in this formalism include robust stability and robust
performance. Here robust performance is defined as the achievement of a uniform
specified $L^{2}$-gain tolerance for a disturbance-to-error map combined with
robust stability. By setting the disturbance and error channels equal to zero,
it is clear that any criterion for robust performance also produces a criterion
for robust stability. Counter-intuitively, as a consequence of the so-called
Main Loop Theorem, application of a result on robust stability to a feedback
configuration with an artificial full-block uncertainty operator added in
feedback connection between the error and disturbance signals produces a result
on robust performance. The main result here is that this
performance-to-stabilization reduction principle must be handled with care for
the case of dynamic feedback compensation: casual application of this principle
leads to the solution of a physically uninteresting problem, where the
controller is assumed to have access to the states in the artificially-added
feedback loop. Application of the principle using a known more refined
dynamic-control robust stability criterion, where the user is allowed to
specify controller partial-state dimensions, leads to correct
robust-performance results. These latter results involve rank conditions in

of significant recent controversy, particularly regarding the importance and
length of the earliest, largely mass-independent disruption phase (referred to

large, independent, and homogeneous data set of UBVR imaging observations, from
which we obtain the cluster age and mass distributions in both the Large and
Small Magelanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in a self-consistent manner. We conclude that
the (optically selected) SMC star cluster population has undergone at most ~30%
(1sigma) infant mortality between the age range from about 3-10 Myr, to that of
approximately 40-160 Myr. We rule out a 90% cluster mortality rate per decade
of age (for the full age range up to 10^9 yr) at a >6sigma level. Using a
simple approach, we derive a ""characteristic"" cluster disruption time-scale for

determining which devices are within direct radio communication is an enabler
for networking protocols and a wide range of applications. To thwart abuse of
ND and the resultant compromise of the dependent functionality of wireless
systems, numerous works proposed solutions to secure ND. Nonetheless, until
very recently, there has been no formal analysis of secure ND protocols. We
close this gap in \cite{asiaccs08}, but we concentrate primarily on the
derivation of an impossibility result for a class of protocols. In this paper,
we focus on reasoning about specific protocols. First, we contribute a number
of extensions and refinements on the framework of [24]. As we are particularly
concerned with the practicality of provably secure ND protocols, we investigate
availability and redefine accordingly the ND specification, and also consider
composability of ND with other protocols. Then, we propose and analyze two
secure ND protocols: We revisit one of the protocols analyzed in [24], and
introduce and prove correct a more elaborate challenge-response protocol.

applications of the basic ideas in these developments to the calculation of
amplitudes in string theory. We consider in particular both non-Abelian and
Abelian open superstring disk amplitudes in a flat space background, focusing
mainly on the four-dimensional case. The basic field theory ideas under
consideration split into three separate categories. In the first, we argue that
the calculation of alpha'-corrections to MHV open string disk amplitudes
reduces to the determination of certain classes of polynomials. This line of
reasoning is then used to determine the alpha'^3-correction to the MHV
amplitude for all multiplicities. A second line of attack concerns the
existence of an analog of CSW rules derived from the Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld
action in four dimensions. We show explicitly that the CSW-like perturbation
series of this action is surprisingly trivial: only helicity conserving
amplitudes are non-zero. Last but not least, we initiate the study of BCFW
on-shell recursion relations in string theory. These should appear very
naturally as the UV properties of the string theory are excellent. We show that
all open four-point string amplitudes in a flat background at the disk level
obey BCFW recursion relations. Based on the naturalness of the proof and some
explicit results for the five-point gluon amplitude, it is expected that this
pattern persists for all higher point amplitudes and for the closed string.

the real line as the degree of non-Hermiticity diminishes. Scaling limit
theorems are proven for the eigenvalue point process at the rightmost edge of
the spectrum, and it is shown that a non-trivial transition occurs between
Poisson and Airy point process statistics when the ratio of the axes of the
supporting ellipse is of order $n^{-1/3}$. In this regime, the family of
limiting probability distributions of the maximum of the real parts of the
eigenvalues interpolates between the Gumbel and Tracy-Widom distributions.

variable rest mass in gravitational field, and explores some its implications.
This line element is not a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, yet it is
sufficiently close to Schwarzschild's line element to be compatible with all of
the experimental and observational measurements made so far to confirm the
three Einstein's predictions. The theory allows radiation and fast particles to
escape from all massive bodies, even from those that in Einstein's general
relativity framework will be black holes. The striking feature of this line
element is the non-existence of black holes.

of GRB 070429B at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds the

The method is based on an expansion about the thin ring limit, where the
cross-section of the ring tends to a circle. The iterative scheme developed
here is applied to homogeneous rings up to the 20th order and to polytropes
with the index n=1 up to the third order. For other polytropic indices no
analytic solutions are obtainable, but one can apply the method numerically.
However, it is possible to derive a simple formula relating mass to the
integrated pressure to leading order without specifying the equation of state.
Our results are compared with those generated by highly accurate numerical
methods to test their accuracy.

breaking term, which reduces the local gauge symmetry down to $\SO(3,1)$, and

topological interactions which corresponds to zeroth order in this perturbative

the particles action contains standard kinetic terms and the deformation shows
up in the presence of interaction terms. The strength of the interactions is
proportional to deformation parameter, identified with Planck mass scale.

exceed 5,000 km/s. At the focal position there is an extremely compact radio
