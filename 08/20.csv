claim to have detected an annual modulation in their signal rate, and have
interpreted this observation as evidence for dark-matter particles at the 8.2
sigma confidence level. Furthermore, it has also been noted that the effects of
channeling may enable a WIMP that scatters elastically via spin-independent
interactions from nuclei to produce the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA without
exceeding the limits placed by CDMS, XENON, CRESST, CoGeNT and other
direct-detection experiments. To accommodate this signal, however, the mass of
the responsible dark-matter particle must be relatively light, m_{DM} \lsim 10
GeV. Such dark-matter particles will become captured by and annihilate in the
Sun at very high rates, leading to a potentially large flux of GeV-scale
neutrinos. We calculate the neutrino spectrum resulting from WIMP annihilations
in the Sun and show that existing limits from Super-Kamiokande can be used to
close a significant portion of the DAMA region, especially if the dark-matter
particles produce tau leptons or neutrinos in a sizable fraction of their
annihilations. We also determine the spin-dependent WIMP-nuclei
elastic-scattering parameter space consistent with DAMA. The constraints from
Super-Kamiokande on the spin-dependent scenario are even more severe--they
exclude any self-annihilating WIMP in the DAMA region that annihilates 1% of
the time or more to any combination of neutrinos, tau leptons, or charm or
bottom quarks.

neutrino singlets (seesaw I), scalar triplets (seesaw II) and fermion triplets

the electron or muon. For seesaw II we concentrate on the likely scenario where
the new scalars decay to two leptons. For seesaw III we restrict ourselves to
heavy Majorana fermion triplets decaying to light leptons plus gauge or Higgs
bosons, which are dominant except for unnaturally small mixings. The possible
signals are classified in terms of the charged lepton multiplicity, studying
nine different final states ranging from one to six charged leptons. Using a
fast detector simulation of signals and backgrounds, it is found that the
trilepton channel l+- l+- l-+ is by far the best one for scalar triplet
discovery, and for fermion triplets it is as good as the like-sign dilepton
channel l+- l+-. For heavy neutrinos with a mass O(100) GeV, this trilepton
channel is also better than the usually studied like-sign dilepton mode. In
addition to evaluating the discovery potential, we make special emphasis on the
discrimination among seesaw models if a positive signal is observed. This could
be accomplished not only by searching for signals in different final states,
but also by reconstructing the mass and determining the charge of the new
resonances, which is possible in several cases. For high luminosities, further
evidence is provided by the analysis of the production angular distributions in
the cleanest channels with three or four leptons.

various spin assignments for the particles A, B, C and D, and derive the
relevant functional basis for the invariant mass distributions which contains
the intrinsic spin information and does not depend on the couplings and mixing

using the three experimentally observable distributions {l+,l-}, {j,l+}+{j,l-}

model-dependent parameter alpha, while the latter may depend on two other
parameters beta and gamma. By fitting these distributions to our set of basis
functions, we are able to do a pure measurement of the spins per se. Our method
is also applicable at a pp-bar collider such as the Tevatron, for which the
previously proposed lepton charge asymmetry is identically zero and does not
contain any spin information. In the process of determining the spins, we also
obtain an independent measurement of the parameters alpha, beta and gamma,
which represent certain combinations of the couplings and the mixing angles of
the heavy partners A, B, C and D.

moduli space configurations, even though one is not taking the planar
expansion. In particular, we show that at strong coupling the corresponding
weak coupling D-brane states of the chiral ring localize on particular
submanifolds of the dual geometry that match the M-theory interpretation. We
also study the massive spectrum of fields in the moduli space. We use this to
investigate the dispersion relation of giant magnons from the field theory
point of view. Our analysis predicts the exact functional form of the
dispersion relation as a function of the world-sheet momentum, independently of
integrability assumptions, but not the exact form with respect to the 't Hooft

interpolating between different approximations suitable for two extreme regions

because of error cancellation between exchange and correlation. ""Abnormal""
regions, where nonlocality is unveiled, include those in which exchange can
dominate correlation (one-electron, nonuniform high-density, and
rapidly-varying limits), and those open subsystems of fluctuating electron

functional mixing exact and semilocal exchange energy densities locally.
Because our mixing fraction tends to 1 in the high-density limit, we rigorously
employ full exact exchange. However, the nonlocality of exchange also requires
balanced nonlocality of correlation, which can demand at least five empirical
parameters. Our local hybrid functional is perhaps the first size-consistent

we generate colors and magnitudes of synthetic populations of ultracool dwarfs

magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and on the nature of the ``second parameter'' that is
responsible for the scatter of colors along the Teff sequence. Variations in
metallicity and cloud parameters, unresolved binaries and possibly a relatively
young population all play a role in defining the spread of brown dwarfs along
the cooling sequence. We find that the transition from cloudy L dwarfs to
cloudless T dwarfs slows down the evolution and causes a pile up of substellar
objects in the transition region, in contradiction with previous studies. We
apply the same model to the Pleiades brown dwarf sequence. Taken at face value,
the Pleiades data suggest that the L/T transition occurs at lower Teff for
lower gravity objects. The simulated populations of brown dwarfs also reveal
that the phase of deuterium burning produces a distinctive feature in CMDs that

evaluated for black holes with various degrees of supersymmetry and for N=4
supersymmetric black holes all results agree. It generally receives

that these are related to, but quantitatively different from, the

range of parameters where linearly stable laminar flow coexists with a
transient turbulent dynamics. When increasing the amplitude of a perturbation
on top of the laminar flow, one notes a a qualitative change in its lifetime,
from smoothly varying and short one on the laminar side to sensitively
dependent on initial conditions and long on the turbulent side. The point of
transition defines a point on the edge of chaos. Since it is defined via the
lifetimes, the edge of chaos can also be used in situations when the turbulence
is not persistent. It then generalises the concept of basin boundaries, which
separate two coexisting attractors, to cases where the dynamics on one side
shows transient chaos and almost all trajectories eventually end up on the
other side. In this paper we analyse a two-dimensional map which captures many
of the features identified in laboratory experiments and direct numerical
simulations of hydrodynamic flows. The analysis of the map shows that different
dynamical situations in the edge of chaos can be combined with different
dynamical situations in the turbulent region. Consequently, the model can be
used to develop and test further characterisations that are also applicable to
realistic flows.

to z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small,
and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar
surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface
density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with
low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates.
Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with
specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by
itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In
general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star
formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface
density of 1-3 10^9 Msun/kpc^2 are ""red and dead"" at low redshift,
approximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars by
z=2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of
galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve
like 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in
their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, and
quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z=0 to
z=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the
Hubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. The star forming
galaxies at z >= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, as
they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scales
comparable to the orbital time.

medium in sub-Lyman-break galaxy protogalactic clumps. Such clumps are abundant
at z=3 and are thought to be a major contributor to damped Ly-alpha absorption.
We model the formation of winds from these clumps and show that during star
formation episodes they feature outflows with neutral gas velocity widths up to
several hundred km/s. Such outflows are consistent with the observed
high-velocity dispersion in DLAs. In our models thermal energy feedback from
winds and supernovae results in efficient outflows only when cold (~ 300 K),
dense (> 100 msun/pc^3) clouds are resolved at grid resolution of 12 pc. At
lower 24 pc resolution the first signs of the multiphase medium are spotted;
however, at this low resolution thermal injection of feedback energy cannot yet
create hot expanding bubbles around star-forming regions -- instead feedback
tends to erase high-density peaks and suppress star formation. At 12 pc
resolution feedback compresses cold clouds, often without disrupting the
ongoing star formation; at the same time a larger fraction of feedback energy
is channeled into low-density bubbles and winds. These winds often entrain
compact neutral clumps which produce multi-component metal absorption lines.

organization and segregation of bacterial chromosomes. The author uses a
""piston"" analogy for bacterial chromosomes in a cell, which leads to a phase
diagram for the organization of two athermal chains confined in a closed
geometry characterized by two length scales (length and width). When applied to
rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this phase diagram predicts that,
despite strong confinement, duplicated chromosomes will demix, i.e., there
exists a primordial physical driving force for chromosome segregation. The
author discusses segregation of duplicating chromosomes using the
concentric-shell model, which predicts that newly synthesized DNA will be found
in the periphery of the chromosome during replication. In contrast to
chromosomes, these results suggest that most plasmids will be randomly
distributed inside the cell because of their small sizes. An active
partitioning system is therefore required for accurate segregation of low-copy
number plasmids. Implications of these results are also sketched, e.g., on the
role of proteins, segregation mechanisms for bacteria of diverse shapes, cell
cycle of an artificial cell, and evolution.

on ""good"" structured random nested codes built over abelian groups. We
demonstrate rate gains for this problem over traditional coding schemes using
random unstructured codes. For certain sources and distortion functions, the
new rate region is strictly bigger than the Berger-Tung rate region, which has
been the best known achievable rate region for this problem till now. Further,
there is no known unstructured random coding scheme that achieves these rate
gains. Achievable performance limits for single-user source coding using
abelian group codes are also obtained as parts of the proof of the main coding
theorem. As a corollary, we also prove that nested linear codes achieve the

vehicular communication (VC) systems, relies on high-rate safety messaging
(beaconing). At the same time, there is consensus among authorities, industry,
and academia on the need to secure VC systems. With specific proposals in the
literature, a critical question must be answered: can secure VC systems be
practical and satisfy the requirements of safety applications, in spite of the
significant communication and processing overhead and other restrictions
security and privacy-enhancing mechanisms impose? To answer this question, we
investigate in this paper the following three dimensions for secure and
privacy-enhancing VC schemes: the reliability of communication, the processing
overhead at each node, and the impact on a safety application. The results
indicate that with the appropriate system design, including sufficiently high
processing power, applications enabled by secure VC can be in practice as
effective as those enabled by unsecured VC.

simulating samples of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae. We separate the
planetary nebulae into two samples containing cooler and hotter central stars,
defined by the absence or presence, respectively, of the \ion{He}{2}
$\lambda$6560 line in the H$\alpha$ spectra. This division separates samples of
younger and more evolved planetary nebulae. The sample of planetary nebulae
with hotter central stars has systematically larger line widths, larger radii,
lower electron densities, and lower H$\beta$ luminosities. The distributions of
these parameters in the two samples all differ at significance levels exceeding
99%. These differences are all in agreement with the expectations from
hydrodynamical models, but for the first time confirmed for a homogeneous and
statistically significant sample of galactic planetary nebulae. We interpret
these differences as evidence for the acceleration of the nebular shells during
the early evolution of these intrinsically bright planetary nebulae. As is the
case for planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds, the acceleration of the
nebular shells appears to be the direct result of the evolution of the central
stars.

quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers: both
would have the (extremely large) power of the complexity class PSPACE,
consisting of all problems solvable by a conventional computer using a
polynomial amount of memory. This solves an open problem proposed by one of us
in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational
complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a
CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a ""causal consistency"" condition is
imposed, meaning that Nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum)
fixed-point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of
the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a
fixed-point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in polynomial space.
This theorem might have independent applications in quantum information.

Secure in-network aggregation can detect such manipulation. But as long as such

collection of individual sensor node values is robust and solves the problem of
availability, yet in an inefficient way. Our work seeks to bridge this gap in

efficiency close to that of in-network aggregation. To achieve this, our scheme
relies on costly operations to localize and exclude nodes that manipulate the
aggregation, but \emph{only} when a failure is detected. The detection of
aggregation disruptions and the removal of faulty nodes provides robustness. At
the same time, after removing faulty nodes, the WSN can enjoy low cost (secure)
aggregation. Thus, the high exclusion cost is amortized, and efficiency
increases.

2H\dot{\delta} - 4\pi G\rho\delta = 0$, which is ubiquitous in the cosmological
literature, in the context of the Newtonian gauge. By comparing the growth
predicted by this equation to a numerical solution of the linearized Einstein
equations in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, we show that while this equation is a
reliable approximation on small scales ($k\gtrsim $h Mpc$^{-1}$), it can be
disastrously inaccurate ($\sim 10^4% $) on larger scales in this gauge. We
propose a modified version of the growth equation for the Newtonian gauge,
which while preserving the simplicity of the original equation, provides
considerably more accurate results. We examine the implications of the failure
of the growth equation on a few recent studies, aimed at discriminating general
relativity from modified gravity, which use this equation as a starting point.
We show that while the results of these studies are valid on small scales, they
are not reliable on large scales or high redshifts, if one works in the
Newtonian gauge. Finally, we discuss the growth equation in the synchronous
gauge and show that the corrections to the Poisson equation are exactly
equivalent to the difference between the overdensities in the synchronous and
Newtonian gauges.

that the local medium is of n_H = 1.5 to 1.9 cm^(-3) and the velocity of the

for Alpha Ori under the assumption that the local medium is moving away from

requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed
below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration

specifically, by combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams
containing fractional Doppler shifts - time delay interferometry (TDI). The

Earth in the Newtonian framework, while the optical links are treated fully
general relativistically and thus, effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay,

  Typically, we consider an analytic manifold M modelled on an ultrametric
Banach space over K, an analytic self-map f of M, and a fixed point p of f.
Under suitable conditions on the tangent map of f at p, we construct a
centre-stable manifold, a centre manifold, respectively, an r-stable manifold
around p, for a given positive real number r not exceeding 1.
  The invariant manifolds are useful in the theory of Lie groups over local
fields, where they allow results to be extended to the case of positive
characteristic which previously were only available in characteristic zero
(i.e., for p-adic Lie groups).

all follow up studies employed instead the assumption that influence is
interpersonal (dyadic). We show how the combination of social influence with

influence yields monoculture in small societies and diversity increasing in
population size, consistently with empirical evidence but contrary to earlier
models. The second problem was identified by Klemm et al.(2003a,b), an
extremely narrow window of noise levels in which diversity with local
convergence can be obtained at all. Our model with social influence generates
stable diversity with local convergence across a much broader interval of noise
levels than models based on interpersonal influence.

temperatures in the presence of incommensurate transverse magnetic fields, with
frustration parameter f= (3-\sqrt{5})/2. We find that the non-equilibrium
relaxation, beginning with random initial states quenched to low temperatures,
exhibits a three-stage relaxation of chirality autocorrelations. At the early
stage, the relaxation is found to be described by the von Schweidler form. Then
it exhibits power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale and faster decay
in the long-time limit, which together can be fitted to the Ogielski form; for
longer waiting times, this crosses over to a stretched exponential form. We
argue that the power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale may be
understood as a consequence of the coarsening behavior, leading to the local
vortex order corresponding to f=2/5 ground-state configurations. High mobility
of the vortices in the domain boundaries, generating slow wandering motion of
the domain walls, may provide mechanism of dynamic heterogeneity and account
for the long-time stretched exponential relaxation behavior. It is expected
that such meandering fluctuations of the low-temperature structure give rise to
finite resistivity at those low temperatures; this appears consistent with the
zero-temperature resistive transition in the limit of irrational frustration.

efficient for both light and heavy-tailed increment distributions. Moreover, in
the case of heavy-tailed increments and under additional technical assumptions,
our estimator can be shown to have asymptotically vanishing relative variance
in the sense that its coefficient of variation vanishes as the tail parameter
increases. A key feature of our algorithm is that it is state-dependent. In the
presence of light tails, our procedure leads to Siegmund's (1979) algorithm.
The rigorous analysis of efficiency requires new Lyapunov-type inequalities
that can be useful in the study of more general importance sampling algorithms.

on a bosonic description of the atomic excitations. In this way, the problem of
light emission by an ensemble of atoms can be solved exactly, including
dipole-dipole interactions and multiple light scattering. Explicit expressions
for the emitted photonic states are obtained in several situations, such as
those of atoms in regular lattices and atomic vapors. We determine the
directionality of the photonic beam, the purity of the photonic state, and the
renormalization of the emission rates. We also show how to observe collective

of loop temperature on loop length which cannot simultaneously account for both
hot and warm loops in the same AR. We then consider time-dependent AR models
based on nanoflare heating. We demonstrate that such models can simultaneously
reproduce EUV and SXR loops in ARs. Moreover, they predict radial intensity
variations consistent with the localized core and extended emissions in SXR and
EUV AR observations respectively. We finally show how the AR morphology can be
used as a gauge of the properties (duration, energy, spatial dependence,
repetition time) of the impulsive heating.

by actin whereas microtubules (MT) acting upstream control where growth occurs
(La Carbona et al, 2006). Growth is limited to the cell poles when MTs undergo
catastrophes there and not elsewhere on the cortex (Brunner and Nurse, 2000).
Here we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in
vitro (Dogterom and Yurke, 1997; Janson et al, 2003) can quantitatively explain
the localization of MT catastro-phes in S. pombe. However, we found that it is
necessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully
consistent with other measured traits of MTs. This result demonstrates the
possibility that MTs together with associated proteins such as kinesins having
a depolymerization activity can reliably mark the tips of the cell.

leads to low-energy electronic collective excitations in a small region around
the c-axis, strongly mixing with interlayer phonons. The manifestation of such
a phonon-plasmon scenario based on a nonadiabatic charge response is
quantitatively supported by a realistic calculation of the frequency and
wavevector dependent irreducible polarization part of the density response
function. The latter is used within linear response theory to calculate the
coupled mode dispersion in the main symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone
and the charge density redistributions excited by certain strongly coupling
phonon-like and plasmon-like modes. Moreover, the corresponding mode induced
orbital averaged changes of the selfconsistent potential felt by the electrons
are assessed. Our analysis should be representative for the optimally to
overdoped state of the cuprates where experimental evidence of a coherent
three-dimensional Fermi surface and a coherent c-axis charge transport is
given. It is demonstrated that modes from the outside of a small region around
the c-axis can reliably be calculated within the adiabatic limit. Only a minor
nonadiabatic correction is found for these modes in form of stiffening of the
high-frequency oxygen-bond-stretching mode at the X-point which is attributed
to dynamical reduced nesting. On the other hand, modes inside the nonadiabatic
sector of the BZ have to be determined nonadiabatically owing to the poor
dynamical screening of the long-ranged Coulomb interaction around the c-axis by
the slow charge dynamics. In particular, the relevance of the strongly coupling
phonon-like apex oxygen $Z$-point breathing mode at about 40 meV is emphasized
whose mode energy decreases with less doping.

spans a wide range of values depending on stellar masses and initial orbits.
Tidal heating may be sufficiently large (in many cases, in excess of radiogenic
heating) and long-lived to drive plate tectonics, similar to the Earth's, which
may enhance the planet's habitability. In other cases, excessive tidal heating
may result in Io-like planets with violent volcanism, probably rendering them
unsuitable for life. On water-rich planets, tidal heating may generate
sub-surface oceans analogous to Europa's with similar prospects for
habitability. Tidal heating may enhance the outgassing of volatiles,
contributing to the formation and replenishment of a planet's atmosphere. To
address these issues, we model the tidal heating and evolution of hypothetical
