the spectral density of the dissipative bosonic bath, neglecting the influence

to an interacting fixed point, for which a quantum to classical mapping breaks
down. Some general implications of our results are discussed.

formation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. We estimate the
cosmic star formation rates (SFR) over the range 0.2 < z < 1.2, using the

strong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, with
massive systems (log (M/M(Sun)) > 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)
to the total star formation rate density (SFRD).
  Combining data from the COSMOS and Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS), we extend
the SFRD-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. For massive galaxies,
we find a steep increase in the SFRD-z relation to z~2; for the less massive
systems, the SFRD which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. This
implies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activity
at earlier epochs (z > 2) than the lower mass galaxies.
  We study changes in the SFRDs as a function of both redshift and stellar mass
for galaxies of different spectral types. We find that the slope of the SFRD-z
relation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of their
stellar mass. For low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution to
the cosmic SFRD comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massive
systems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

to be too hot for grain sedimentation to form a silicate core. Smaller
protoplanets are cold enough to allow grain settling and core formation. Grain
sedimentation and core formation occur in the low mass protoplanets because of
their slow contraction rate and low internal temperature. It is predicted that
massive giant planets will not have cores, while smaller planets will have
small rocky cores whose masses depend on the planetary mass, the amount of
solids within the body, and the disk environment. The protoplanets are found to
be too hot to allow the existence of icy grains, and therefore the cores are
predicted not to contain any ices. It is suggested that the atmospheres of low
mass giant planets are depleted in refractory elements compared with the
atmospheres of more massive planets. These predictions provide a test of the
disk instability model of gas giant planet formation.
  The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn were found to be ~0.25 M_Earth and ~0.5
M_Earth, respectively. The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn can be
substantially larger if planetesimal accretion is included. The final core mass

when compared with observations obtained with larger apertures such as ISO, we
present mid-infrared spectra of two Magellanic Cloud HII regions, N88A and
N160A. We obtained mid-infrared (8-13 um), long-slit spectra with TIMMI2 on the
ESO 3.6m telescope. These are combined with archival spectra obtained with the
Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, and are
compared with the low-spatial resolution ISO-SWS data. An inventory of the
spectra in terms of atomic fine-structure lines and molecular bands is
presented. Concerning N88A, an isolated HII region with no adjacent infrared
sources, the observations indicate that the line fluxes observed by ISO-SWS and
Spitzer-IRS come exclusively from the compact HII region of about 3 arcsec in
diameter. This is not the case for N160A, which has a more complex morphology.
We have spectroscopically isolated for the first time the individual
contributions of the three components of N160A, two high-excitation blobs, A1
and A2, and the young stellar object N160A-IR. In addition, extended [SIV]
emission is observed with TIMMI2 and is most likely associated with the central
star cluster located between A1 and A2. We show the value of these high-spatial
resolution data in determining source characteristics, such as the degree of
ionization of each high-excitation blob or the bolometric luminosity of the
YSO. This luminosity is about one order of magnitude lower than previously
estimated. For each high-excitation blob, we also determine the electron
density and the elemental abundances of Ne, S, and Ar.

very early in envelopes of AGB stars, and that it consumes most of the carbon,
or most of the oxygen, depending on whether the photosphere is oxygen-rich or
carbon-rich, respectively. \rm This work focuses on the latter case, with the
purpose of quantifying the remaining fraction of gaseous carbon which is then
available for forming carbonaceous grains. Since AGB stars are (probably) the
main providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in
establishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic
treatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards
steady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the
atomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section
for CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C
atoms per million H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction
rates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of
thumb recalled above.
  The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H-->CH: far
from thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if
this rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this
rate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and
high enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations. An accurate
experimental rate determination is highly desirable.

and molecular data, and detailed treatment of blends, have resulted in a
significant downward revision of the solar oxygen abundance.
  Aims: Considering the importance of the Sun as an astrophysical standard and
the current conflict of standard solar models using the new solar abundances
with helioseismological observations we have performed a new study of the solar
oxygen abundance based on the forbidden [OI] line at 5577.34 A, not previously
considered.
  Methods: High-resolution (R > 500 000), high signal-to-noise (S/N > 1000)
solar spectra of the [O I] 5577.34 A line have been analyzed employing both
three-dimensional (3D) and a variety of 1D (spatially and temporally averaged
3D, Holweger & Muller, MARCS and Kurucz models with and without convective
overshooting) model atmospheres.
  Results: The oxygen abundance obtained from the [OI] 5577.3 A forbidden line
is almost insensitive to the input model atmosphere and has a mean value of
A(O) = 8.71 +/- 0.02 (\sigma from using the different model atmospheres). The
total error (0.07 dex) is dominated by uncertainties in the log gf value (0.03
dex), apparent line variation (0.04 dex) and uncertainties in the continuum and
line positions (0.05 dex).
  Conclusions: The here derived oxygen abundance is close to the 3D-based
estimates from the two other [OI] lines at 6300 and 6363 A, the permitted OI
lines and vibrational and rotational OH transitions in the infrared. Our study
thus supports a low solar oxygen abundance (A(O) ~ 8.7), independent of the
adopted model atmosphere.

the unit vector along dimension i of the k-dimensional Euclidean space, can be
approximated by the distribution of the sum of another set of independent unit
vectors whose probabilities of obtaining each value are multiples of 1/z for
some integer z, and so that the variational distance of the two distributions
is at most eps, where eps is bounded by an inverse polynomial in z and a
function of k, but with no dependence on n. Our probabilistic result specifies
the construction of a surprisingly sparse eps-cover -- under the total
variation distance -- of the set of distributions of sums of independent unit
vectors, which is of interest on its own right.

white dwarfs with photospheric metals must be actively accreting. It is
therefore natural to expect that the metals may not be deposited uniformly on
the surface of the star. We present calculations showing how the temperature
variations associated with white dwarf pulsations lead to an observable
diagnostic of the surface metal distribution, and we show what constraints
current data sets are able to provide. We also investigate the effect that
time-variable accretion has on the metal abundances of different species, and
we show how this can lead to constraints on the gravitational settling times.

potential for D-brane inflation in the warped deformed conifold. We consider
the D3-brane potential in the presence of the most general possible corrections
to the throat geometry sourced by coupling to the bulk of a compact Calabi-Yau
space. This corresponds to the potential on the Coulomb branch of the dual
gauge theory, in the presence of arbitrary perturbations of the Lagrangian. The
leading contributions arise from perturbations by the most relevant operators
that do not destroy the throat geometry. We find a generic contribution from a
non-chiral operator of dimension $\Delta=2$ associated with a global symmetry
current, resulting in a negative contribution to the inflaton mass-squared. If
the Calabi-Yau preserves certain discrete symmetries, this is the dominant
correction to the inflaton potential, and fine-tuning of the inflaton mass is
possible. In the absence of such discrete symmetries, the dominant contribution
comes from a chiral operator with $\Delta=3/2$, corresponding to a $\phi^{3/2}$
term in the inflaton potential. The resulting inflationary models are
phenomenologically similar to the inflection point scenarios arising from
specific D7-brane embeddings, but occur under far more general circumstances.
Our strategy extends immediately to other warped geometries, given sufficient
knowledge of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum.

lines of argument that predicate the existence of UMBHs: (i) expected as a
natural extension of the observed black hole mass bulge luminosity relation,
when extrapolated to the bulge luminosities of bright central galaxies in
clusters; (ii) new predictions for the mass function of seed black holes at
high redshifts predict that growth via accretion or merger-induced accretion
inevitably leads to the existence of rare UMBHs at late times; (iii) the local
mass function of black holes computed from the observed X-ray luminosity
functions of active galactic nuclei predict the existence of a high mass tail
in the black hole mass function at $z = 0$. Consistency between the optical and
X-ray census of the local black hole mass function requires an upper limit to
black hole masses. This consistent picture also predicts that the slope of the
$M_{\rm bh}$-$\sigma$ relation will evolve with redshift at the high mass end.
Models of self-regulation that explain the co-evolution of the stellar
component and nuclear black holes naturally provide such an upper limit. The
combination of multi-wavelength constraints predicts the existence of UMBHs and
simultaneously provides an upper limit to their masses. The typical hosts for
these local UMBHs are likely the bright, central cluster galaxies in the nearby
Universe.

We demonstrate that in the littlest LH model and the SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) LH model,
ensuring that the correct vacuum alignment is chosen requires that a subset of
the gauge sector couplings be large to overcome the effect of the top quark. We
quantify this effect by deriving bounds on the couplings in the gauge sector

the gauge coupling constant hierarchy in the SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) model that
reduces the Goldstone decay constant scale to a TeV. We also argue that for a

explore the nature of a sample of Spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies
(DOGs) in GOODS-N. A sample of 79 galaxies satisfy the criteria R-[24]>14
(Vega) down to S24>100 microJy. Twelve of these galaxies have IRS spectra
available which we use to measure redshifts and classify these objects as being
dominated by star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the
mid-IR. The IRS spectra and Spitzer photometric redshifts confirm that the DOGs
lie in a tight redshift distribution around z~2. Based on mid-IR colors, 80% of
DOGs are likely dominated by star formation; the stacked X-ray emission from
this sub-sample of DOGs is also consistent with star formation. Since only a
small number of DOGs are individually detected at far-IR and submm wavelengths,
we use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects and
plot a composite IR (8-1000 microns) spectral energy distribution (SED). The
average luminosity of these star forming DOGs is LIR~1e12 Lsun. We compare the
average star forming DOG to the average bright (S850>5 mJy) submillimeter
galaxy (SMG); the S24>100 microJy DOGs are 3 times more numerous but 8 times
less luminous in the IR. The far-IR SED shape of DOGs is similar to that of
SMGs (average dust temperature of around 30 K) but DOGs have a higher mid-IR to
far-IR flux ratio. The average star formation-dominated DOG has a star
formation rate of 200 Msun/yr which, given their space density, amounts to a
contribution of 0.01 Msun/yr/Mpc3 (or 5-10%) to the star formation rate density
at z~2. We use the composite SED to predict the average flux of DOGs in future
Herschel/PACS 100 micron and SCUBA-2 450 micron surveys and show that the

working within a previously-proposed CMB bipolar modulation model, we constrain
model parameters: the amplitude and the orientation of the modulation field as
a function of various multipole bins. Finally, we select three ranges of
multipoles leading to the most anomalous signals, and we process corresponding
100 Gaussian, random field (GRF) simulations, treated as observational data, to
further test the statistical significance and robustness of the hemispherical
power asymmetry. For our analysis we use the Internally-Linearly-Coadded (ILC)

five year data (V5). We constrain the modulation parameters using a generic
maximum a posteriori method.
  In particular, we find differences in hemispherical power distribution, which
when described in terms of a model with bipolar modulation field, exclude the
field amplitude value of the isotropic model A=0 at confidence level of ~99.5%
(~99.4%) in the multipole range l=[7,19] (l=[7,79]) in the V5 data, and at the

unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short period star S0-2 provides values
for Ro of 8.0+-0.6 kpc, M_bh of 4.1+-0.6x10^6 Mo, and the black hole's radial
velocity, which is consistent with zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. If the black
hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy, we can further
constrain the fit and obtain Ro = 8.4+-0.4 kpc and M_bh = 4.5+-0.4x10^6 Mo.
More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less
than 3-4x10^5 Mo within 0.01 pc, ~100x higher than predictions from stellar and
stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric
shifts from source confusion and the assumptions regarding the black hole's
radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and
the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will
remedy these effects. Our estimates of Ro and the Galaxy's local rotation
speed, which it is derived from combining Ro with the apparent proper motion of
Sgr A*, (theta0 = 229+-18 km/s), are compatible with measurements made using
other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to
that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for
the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in
the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the M_bh-sigma
relation.

interacting particles is analyzed in detail with the use of the non-Markovian
fractional Smoluchowki equation (FSE). It is suggested that the interparticle
interaction potential is of the shape of potential well and reactivity is
located within the well. The reaction kinetics is studied in the limit of deep
well, in which the FSE can be solved analytically. This solution enables one to
obtain the kinetics in a simple analytical form. The analytical expression
shows that the SDAR kinetics fairly substantially depends on the mechanism of
reactivity within the well. Specific features of the kinetics are thoroughly
analyzed in two models of reactivity: the subdiffusion assisted activated rate
model and the first order reaction model. The theory developed is applied to
the interpretation of experimental kinetics of photoluminescence decay in
amorphous $a$-Si:H semiconductors governed by geminate recombination of
electrons and holes which are recently found to undergo subdiffusive relative
motion. Analysis of results demonstrates that the subdiffusion assisted
activated rate mechanism of reaction is closer to reality as applied to
amorphous $a$-Si:H semiconductors. Comparison of experimental and theoretical
kinetics allowed for obtaining some kinetic parameters of the systems under
study: the rate of escaping from the well and the parameter characterizing the

optical lattice, comparing with results obtained in an attractive Hubbard
model. In the strong coupling regime of the Hubbard model, it has been
predicted that the motion of a bound pair between lattice sites is accompanied
by virtual dissociation. To explore the possibility of this interesting
phenomenon in optical lattice, we calculate molecular wavefunction in a
cosine-shape periodic potential. We show that the molecular tunneling
accompanied by dissociation occurs in the intermediate coupling regime of the
optical lattice system. In the strong coupling regime, in contrast to the
prediction in the Hubbard model, the bound pair is shown to tunnel through
lattice potential without dissociation. As a result, the magnitude of molecular
band mass M remains finite even in the strong coupling limit, which is in
contrast to the diverging molecular mass in the case of the Hubbard model.
Including this finite value of molecular band mass, we evaluate the superfluid
phase transition temperature Tc in the BEC limit of the optical lattice system,
where the Hubbard model gives Tc=0 due to the diverging molecular mass.

unsuccessful. Much of the effort in modelling the predicted emission has been
based on the analogy with the well-known emission from Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter,
however, many of the targets of these radio searches are so close to their
parent stars that they may well lie inside the stellar magnetosphere. For these
close-in planets we determine which physical processes dominate the radio
emission and compare our results to those for large-orbit planets that are
immersed in the stellar wind. We have modelled the reconnection of the stellar
and planetary magnetic fields. We calculate the extent of the planetary
magnetosphere if it is in pressure balance with its surroundings and determine
the conditions under which reconnection of the stellar and planetary magnetic
fields could provide the accelerated electrons necessary for the predicted
radio emission. We show that received radio fluxes of tens of mJy are possible
for exoplanets in the solar neighbourhood that are close to their parent stars
if their stars have surface field strengths above 1-10G. We show that for these
close-in planets, the power of the radio emission depends principally on the
ratio (Nc/B^{1/3})^2 where Nc is the density at the base of the stellar corona,
and B is the stellar surface magnetic field strength. Radio emission is most
likely to be detected from planets around stars with high-density coronae,
which are therefore likely to be bright X-ray sources. The dependence of
stellar coronal density on stellar rotation rate and effective temperature is
crucial in predicting radio fluxes from exoplanets.

honest times to financial modeling. It studies a financial market with asset
prices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building
block of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which
maximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security
account prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative
local martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral
probability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as
conditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as
numeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the
global maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units
of the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest
time. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute
the conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this
framework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for
uniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the
global maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and
universal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a

vacuum results from a competition of a (leading) two-loop effect and small
""Planck"" suppressed higher-dimension operators. This mechanism provides a
particularly simple realization of dynamical SUSY and R-symmetry breaking, and
as such it is a good starting point for building phenomenologically viable
models of gauge mediation. We take a preliminary step in this direction by
constructing a complete model of minimal gauge mediation. Here we find that the
parameters of the model are surprisingly constrained by the hidden sector.
Similar mechanisms for creating long-lived states operate in a large class of

Part of this difference may be explained by cold nuclear matter effects but the
most central collisions suggest that regeneration mechanisms could be at play.
In 2007, PHENIX collected almost four times more Au+Au collisions at this
energy than used for previous published results. Moreover, the addition of a
new reaction plane detector allows a much better analysis of the J/psi behavior
in the azimuthal plane. Since a large elliptic flow has been measured for open
charm, measuring J/psi azimuthal anisotropies may give a hint if J/psi are
recombined in the expanding matter. First PHENIX results of J/psi elliptic flow
as a function of transverse momentum at forward rapidity are presented in this

PHENIX preliminary results as well as to predictions.

nuclear matter but a relatively large value of the symmetry energy. We study
the the influence of the three-body forces on the single-particle properties.
For symmetric matter the spectral function is broadened at all momenta and all
densities, while an opposite effect is found for the case of neutrons only.
Noticeable modification of the spectral functions are realized only for

equally distant and is predestined to show richer behaviours than the bouncing
ball or the bouncing dimer. The rigid trimer has been placed on a plate of a
electromagnetic shaker and has been vertically vibrated according to a
sinusoidal signal. The horizontal translational and rotational motions of the
trimer have been recorded for a range of frequencies between 25 and 100 Hz
while the amplitude of the forcing vibration was tuned for obtaining maximal
acceleration of the plate up to 10 times the gravity. Several modes have been
detected like e.g. rotational and pure translational motions. These modes are
found at determined accelerations of the plate and do not depend on the
frequency. By recording the time delays between two successive contacts when
the frequency and the amplitude are fixed, a mapping of the bouncing regime has
been constructed and compared to that of the dimer and the bouncing ball.
Period-2 and period-3 orbits have been experimentally observed. In these modes,
according to observations, the contact between the trimer and the plate is
persistent between two successive jumps. This persistence erases the memory of
the jump preceding the contact. A model is proposed and allows to explain the
values of the particular accelerations for which period-2 and period-3 modes
are observed. Finally, numerical simulations allow to reproduce the
experimental results. That allows to conclude that the friction between the
beads and the plate is the major dissipative process.

metallicity. A new Galactic Cepheid confirmed here, GSC 03729-01127 (F6-G1 Ib),

recent estimates of its metallicity constrain it to be a Population I overtone
pulsator rather than a Type II s-Cepheid. AB Cam and BD Cas are not physically
associated with the spatially-adjacent open clusters Tombaugh 5 and King 13,
respectively, the latter being much older (log t ~ 9) than believed previously.
Rates of period change are determined for the three Cepheids from archival and

fifth and third crossings of the instability strip, respectively, while BD Cas
exhibits a period decrease, indicating a second crossing, with possible
superposed trends unrelated to binarity. More importantly, the observed rates

current critical points in an open billiard system, and compare them with the
predictions of the Random Wave Model (RWM). In particular, due to a novel
improvement of the experimental set-up, we determine experimentally the spatial
correlation of saddle points of the current field. An asymptotic expression for
the vortex-saddle and saddle-saddle correlation functions based on the RWM is
derived, with experiment and theory agreeing well. We also derive an expression
for the density of saddle points in the presence of a straight boundary with
general mixed boundary conditions in the RWM, and compare with experimental
measurements of the vortex and saddle density in the vicinity of a straight
wall satisfying Dirichlet conditions.

In this paper we ask when it is possible to find a subset $\Lambda$ in $\br^d$
such that the corresponding complex exponential functions $e_\lambda$ indexed
by $\Lambda$ are orthogonal and total in $L^2(\mu)$. If this happens, we say
that $(\mu, \Lambda)$ is a spectral pair. This is a Fourier duality, and the
$x$-variable for the $L^2(\mu)$-functions is one side in the duality, while the
points in $\Lambda$ is the other. Stated this way, the framework is too wide,
and we shall restrict attention to measures $\mu$ which come with an intrinsic
scaling symmetry built in and specified by a finite and prescribed system of
contractive affine mappings in $\br^d$; an affine iterated function system
(IFS). This setting allows us to generate candidates for spectral pairs in such
a way that the sets on both sides of the Fourier duality are generated by
suitably chosen affine IFSs. For a given affine setup, we spell out the
appropriate duality conditions that the two dual IFS-systems must have. Our
condition is stated in terms of certain complex Hadamard matrices. Our main
results give two ways of building higher dimensional spectral pairs from
combinatorial algebra and spectral theory applied to lower dimensional systems.

Major mistake corrected in version 2","Open Sys. & Information Dyn. 16 (2009) 145",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A SIC consists of N^2 equiangular unit vectors in an N dimensional Hilbert
space. The frame potential is a function of N^2 unit vectors. It has a unique
global minimum if the vectors form a SIC, and this property has been made use
of in numerical searches for SICs. When the vectors form an orbit of the
Heisenberg group the frame potential becomes a function of a single fiducial
vector. We analytically compute the average of this function over Hilbert
space. We also compute averages when the fiducial vector is placed in certain
special subspaces defined by the Clifford group.
