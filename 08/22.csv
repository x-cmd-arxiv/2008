(ROTSE-IIIb) telescope of SN 2008es, an overluminous supernova (SN) at z=0.205
with a peak visual magnitude of -22.2. We present multiwavelength follow-up
observations with the Swift satellite and several ground-based optical
telescopes. The ROTSE-IIIb observations constrain the time of explosion to be
23+/-1 rest-frame days before maximum. The linear decay of the optical light
curve, and the combination of a symmetric, broad H\alpha emission line profile
with broad P Cygni H\beta and Na I \lambda5892 profiles, are properties
reminiscent of the bright Type II-L SNe 1979C and 1980K, although SN 2008es is
greater than 10 times more luminous. The host galaxy is undetected in
pre-supernova Sloan Digital Sky Survey images, and similar to Type II-L SN
2005ap (the most luminous SN ever observed), the host is most likely a dwarf
galaxy with M_r > -17. Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observations in
combination with Palomar photometry measure the SED of the SN from 200 to 800
nm to be a blackbody that cools from a temperature of 14,000 K at the time of
the optical peak to 6400 K 65 days later. The inferred blackbody radius is in
good agreement with the radius expected for the expansion speed measured from
the broad lines (10,000 km/s). The bolometric luminosity at the optical peak is
2.8 x 10^44 erg/s, with a total energy radiated over the next 65 days of 5.6 x
10^50 erg. We favor a model in which the exceptional peak luminosity is a
consequence of the core-collapse explosion of a progenitor star with a low-mass
extended hydrogen envelope and a stellar wind with a density close to the upper
limit on the mass-loss rate measured from the lack of an X-ray detection by the
Swift X-Ray Telescope. (Abridged).

metal-poor (Population II) stars. This problem has loomed for the past decade,
with a persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2--3 in 7Li/H. Recent developments
have sharpened all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory
predictions have sharpened due to new nuclear data, particularly the
uncertainty on 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be, has reduced to 7.4%, and with a central
value shift of ~ +0.04 keV barn. (2) The WMAP 5-year data now yields a cosmic
baryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7%. (3) Observations of
metal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects, and have reaped new
lithium isotopic data. With these, we now find that the BBN+WMAP predicts 7Li/H
= (5.24+0.71-0.67) 10^{-10}. The Li problem remains and indeed is exacerbated;
the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4--4.3 or 4.2sigma (from globular cluster
stars) to 5.3sigma (from halo field stars). Possible resolutions to the lithium
problem are briefly reviewed, and key nuclear, particle, and astronomical
measurements highlighted.

function for a system of identical bosons with general interactions through
first-order in a perturbation approach. This method is based on the maximal
symmetry present at lowest order in a perturbation series in inverse spatial
dimensions. The symmetric structure at lowest order has a point group
isomorphic with the S_N group, the symmetric group of N particles, and the
resulting perturbation expansion of the Hamiltonian is order-by-order invariant
under the permutations of the S_N group. This invariance under S_N imposes
severe symmetry requirements on the tensor blocks needed at each order in the
perturbation series. We show here that these blocks can be decomposed into a
basis of binary tensors invariant under S_N. This basis is small (25 terms at
first order in the wave function), independent of N, and is derived using
graphical techniques. This checks the N^6 scaling of these terms at first order
by effectively separating the N scaling problem away from the rest of the
physics. The transformation of each binary tensor to the final normal
coordinate basis requires the derivation of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients of S_N
for arbitrary N. This has been accomplished using the group theory of the
symmetric group. This achievement results in an analytic solution for the wave
function, exact through first order, that scales as N^0, effectively
circumventing intensive numerical work. This solution can be systematically
improved with further analytic work by going to yet higher orders in the
perturbation series.

catalysis of symmetry breaking in strong gravitational field is demonstrated in
the regime of weak coupling constants. In the case of strong couplings it is

active regions (ARs) in the period studied. An automated method, based on
SOHO/MDI magnetic synoptic charts, is used to select and characterize the ARs.
For each AR, a set of parameters are derived including the areas (positive,
negative and total, denoted by A_P, A_N and A_T respectively), the magnetic
fluxes (positive, negative and total, F_P, F_N and F_T respectively), the
average magnetic field strength (B_avg), quasi-elongation (e) characterizing
the overall shape of the AR, the number and length of polarity inversion lines
(PILs, or neutral lines, N_PIL and L_PIL respectively), and the average and
maximum of magnetic gradient on the PILs (GOP_avg and GOP_max respectively).
Our statistical analysis shows a general trend between the scales of an AR and
the likelihood of producing a fast CME, i.e., the larger the geometric size
(A_T), the larger the magnetic flux (F_T), the stronger the magnetic field
(B_avg), and/or the more complex the magnetic configuration (N_PIL and L_PIL),
then the higher the possibility of producing a fast CME. When all ARs are
sorted into three equally-numbered groups with low, middle and high values of
these parameters, we find that, for all these AR parameters, more than 60% of
extremely fast CMEs are from the high-value group. The two PIL parameters are
the best indicators of producing fast CMEs, with more than 80% from the high
value group.

sub-mm continuum image of G034.43+00.24 MM1 reveals a compact (~0.03 pc) and
massive (~29 Msun) structure while the molecular line spectrum shows emission
from numerous complex molecules. Such a rich molecular line spectrum from a

an early stage in the formation of a high-mass protostar. Moreover, the
velocity structure of its 13CO(3-2) emission indicates that this B0 protostar
may be surrounded by a rotating circumstellar envelope. In contrast, the sub-mm
continuum image of G028.53-00.25 MM1 reveals three compact (<0.06 pc), massive
(9-21 Msun) condensations but with no lines detected in its spectrum. We
suggest that the core G028.53-00.25 MM1 is in a very early stage in the
high-mass star-formation process; its size and mass are sufficient to form at
least one high-mass star, yet it shows no signs of localized heating. Because
the combination of high velocity line wings with a large IR-mm bolometric
luminosity (~100 Lsun) indicates that this core has already begun to form
accreting protostars, we speculate that the condensations may be in the early
phase of accretion and may eventually become high-mass protostars. We,
therefore, have found the possible existence of two high-mass star-forming
cores; one in a very early phase of star-formation and one in the later hot
core phase. Together the properties of these two cores support the idea that
the earliest stages of high-mass star-formation occur within IRDCs.

could be either eruptive or confined, we investigate four X-class events from
each of the two types. Both sets of events are selected to have very similar
intensities (X1.0 to X3.6) and duration (rise time under 13 minutes and decay
time not over 9 minutes) in soft X-ray observations, to reduce any bias due to
flare size on CME occurrence. We find that the occurrence of eruption (or
confinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy
release, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted
magnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6 - 17 Mm for
confined events but as large as 22 - 37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that
confined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events
tend to occur close to the edge of active regions. We use the potential field
source-surface model to infer the coronal magnetic field above the source
active regions and calculate the flux ratio of low (<1.1 Rs) to high (>1.1 Rs)
corona. We find that the confined events have a lower ratio (<5.7) than the

propose a new two parameter fitting function that has a linearly varying
logarithmic density gradient which fits the GHALO and VL2 density profiles
extremely well. Convergence in the density profile and the halo shape scales as
N^(-1/3), but the shape converges at a radius three times larger at which point
the halo becomes more spherical due to numerical resolution. The six
dimensional phase-space profile is dominated by the presence of the
substructures and does not follow a power law, except in the smooth

the discovery of two brown dwarf companions (HD49197B and HD203030B), 24 new

3.2% (+3.1%,-2.7%; 2sigma limits). The result demonstrates that the deficiency
of substellar companions at wide orbital separations from Sun-like stars is
less pronounced than in the radial velocity ""brown dwarf desert."" We infer that
the mass distribution of companions in 28-1590AU orbits around solar-mass stars
follows a continuous dN/dM_2 ~ M_2^(-0.4) relation over the 0.01-1.0Msun
secondary mass range. While this functional form is similar to that for
<0.1Msun isolated objects, over the entire 0.01-1.0Msun range the mass
functions of companions and of isolated objects differ significantly. Based on
this conclusion and on similar results from other direct imaging and radial
velocity companion surveys in the literature, we argue that the companion mass
function follows the same universal form over the entire range between 0-1590AU
in orbital semi-major axis and 0.01-20Msun in companion mass. In this context,
the relative dearth of substellar versus stellar secondaries at all orbital
separations arises naturally from the inferred form of the companion mass
function.

information on cosmological parameters. At large scales, the observable galaxy
power spectrum Pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of Plin(k), but on
smaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratio
Pobs(k)/Plin(k) scale-dependent. We develop a method that can extend the
dynamic range of the Plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on the
galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) from the projected galaxy correlation
function wp. We devise an analytic model to calculate Pobs(k) in real-space and
redshift-space. Once HOD parameters are determined by matching wp for a given
cosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic model
predicts both the shape and normalization of Pobs(k). Applying our method to
SDSS main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space Pobs(k) follows the shape
of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/Mpc.
When we apply our method to SDSS LRG samples, the linear bias approximation is
accurate to 5% at k<0.08 h/Mpc, but the scale-dependence of LRG bias prevents
the use of linear theory at k>0.08 h/Mpc. Our HOD model prediction is in good
agreement with the recent SDSS LRG Pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales
(k<0.2 h/Mpc), naturally explaining the shape of Pobs(k). The ""Q-model""
prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the LRG samples, and it
can lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k>0.1
h/Mpc are included in the analysis. We quantify the potential bias and
constraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theory
and Q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of HOD modeling of future
high precision measurements of Pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales.

observed as an X-ray emitting plasma (the intracluster medium, hereafter ICM)

galaxy formation model GALFORM that allows us to investigate the properties of
the ICM. As we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments,
the previous model (presented in Bower et al. 2006) fails to reproduce even the
most basic observed properties of the ICM; however, we present a simple
modification to the model to allow for heat input into the ICM from the AGN
""radio mode"" feedback. This heating acts to expel gas from the X-ray luminous
central regions of the host halo. With this modification, the model reproduces
the observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature relation of groups
and clusters. Introducing the heating process into the model requires changes
to a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observed
galaxy properties. With the revised parameters, the best fitting luminosity
function is comparable to that presented in Bower et al. (2006). The new model
makes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy and
cluster ICM formation. However, the detailed comparison with the data is not
completely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement.

nonparametric U&D estimation. An improvement to isotonic regression called
""centered isotonic regression"" (CIR), and a new averaging estimator called
""auto-detect"" are introduced and their properties studied. Bayesian
percentile-finding designs, most notably the continual reassessment method
(CRM) developed for Phase I clinical trials, are also studied. In general, CRM
convergence depends upon random run-time conditions -- meaning that convergence
is not always assured. Small-sample behavior is studied as well. It is shown
that CRM is quite sensitive to outlier sub-sequences of thresholds, resulting
in highly variable small-sample behavior between runs under identical
conditions. Nonparametric CRM variants exhibit a similar sensitivity. Ideas to
combine the advantages of U&D and Bayesian designs are examined. A new approach
is developed, using a hybrid framework, that evaluates the evidence for
overriding the U&D allocation with a Bayesian one.

represent the object as a collection of small Stokes spheres or stokeslets, and
the gravitational force as a constant point force applied at an arbitrary point
of the object. For a generic configuration of stokeslets and forcing point, the
motion takes a simple form in the nearly free draining limit where the
stokeslet radius is arbitrarily small. In this case, the internal hydrodynamic
interactions between stokeslets are weak, and the object follows a helical path
while rotating at a constant angular velocity $\omega$ about a fixed axis. This
$\omega$ is independent of initial orientation, and thus constitutes a chiral
response for the object. Even though there can be no such chiral response in
the absence of hydrodynamic interactions between the stokeslets, the angular
velocity obtains a fixed, nonzero limit as the stokeslet radius approaches
zero. We characterize empirically how $\omega$ depends on the placement of the
stokeslets, concentrating on three-stokeslet objects with the external force
applied far from the stokeslets. Objects with the largest $\omega$ are aligned
along the forcing direction. In this case, the limiting $\omega$ varies as the
inverse square of the minimum distance between stokeslets. We illustrate the
prevalence of this robust chiral motion with experiments on small macroscopic
objects of arbitrary shape.

exceptionally low for the IC 1396A protostars, compared to those in nearby

while higher-mass (A-F) stars have weaker features requiring abundant
crystalline silicates. The distribution of Class I sources is concentrated
within the molecular globule, while the Class II sources are more widely
scattered. Combined with the spectral results, this suggests two phases of star
formation, the first (4 Myr ago) leading to the widespread Class II sources and
the central O star of IC 1396, and the second (<1 Myr ago) occurring within the

where the probability of detecting a planetary signal is high. Its conventional
definition as the range between $\sim 0.6$ and 1.6 Einstein radii of the
primary lens is based on the criterion that a major caustic induced by a planet
should be located within the Einstein ring of the primary. However, current
planetary lensing searches focus on high-magnification events to detect
perturbations induced by another caustic located always within the Einstein
ring very close to the primary lens (stellar caustic) and thus a new definition
of a lensing zone is needed. In this paper, we determine this lensing zone. By
applying a criterion that detectable planets should produce signals $\geq 5%$,
we find that the new lensing zone varies depending on the planet/star mass
ratio unlike the fixed range of the classical zone regardless of the mass
ratio. The lensing zone is equivalent to the classical zone for a planet with a
planet/star mass ratio $q\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ and it becomes wider for heavier
planets. For a Jupiter-mass planet, the lensing zone ranges from 0.25 to 3.9
Einstein radii, corresponding to a physical range between $\sim 0.5$ AU and 7.4
AU for a typical Galactic event. The wider lensing zone of central
perturbations for giant planets implies that the microlensing method provides
an important tool to detect planetary systems composed of multiple ice-giant
planets.

different distributions on the [OIII]/H$\beta $ vs [NII]/H$\alpha$ diagram (BPT
diagram) for narrow lines. Seyfert 2 galaxies display a clear left boundary on
the BPT diagram and only 7.3% of them lie on the left. By contrast, Seyfert 1
galaxies do not show such a cutoff and 33.0% of them stand on the left side of
the boundary. Among Seyfert 1 galaxies, the distribution varies with the
extinction to broad lines. As the extinction increases, the distribution on BPT
diagram moves to larger [NII]/H$\alpha$ value. We interpret this as an evidence
for the obscuration of inner dense narrow line region by the dusty torus. We
also demonstrate that the [OIII] and broad line luminosity correlation depends
on the extinction of broad lines in the way that high extinction objects have
lower uncorrected [OIII] luminosities, suggesting that [OIII] is partially
obscured in these objects. Therefore, using [OIII] as an indicator for the
nuclear luminosity will systematically under-estimate the nuclear luminosity of

discovered, \cite{CPR2,CRT}. We show that these examples are not isolated.
Rather there is a general framework in which we use KMS states for circle
actions on a C*-algebra A to construct Kasparov modules and semifinite spectral
triples. By using a residue construction analogous to that used in the
semifinite local index formula we associate to these triples a twisted cyclic
cocycle on a dense subalgebra of A. This cocycle pairs with the equivariant
KK-theory of the mapping cone algebra for the inclusion of the fixed point
algebra of the circle action in A. The pairing is expressed in terms of
spectral flow between a pair of unbounded self adjoint operators that are
Fredholm in the semifinite sense. A novel aspect of our work is the discovery
of an eta cocycle that forms a part of our twisted residue cocycle. To
illustrate our theorems we observe firstly that they incorporate the results in
\cite{CPR2,CRT} as special cases. Next we use the Araki-Woods III_\lambda

magnetowaves (MPWA). This concept was originally proposed as a viable mechanism
for the ""cosmic accelerator"" that would accelerate cosmic particles to ultra
high energies in the astrophysical setting. Unlike the more familiar Plasma
Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA) and the Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) where
the drivers, the charged-particle beam and the laser, are independently
existing entities, MPWA invokes the high-frequency and high-speed whistler mode
as the driver, which is a medium wave that cannot exist outside of the plasma.
Aside from the difference in drivers, the underlying mechanism that excites the
plasma wakefield via the ponderomotive potential is common. Our computer
simulations show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma wakefield
maintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient acceleration over
many plasma wavelengths. We suggest that in addition to its celestial
application, the MPWA concept can also be of terrestrial utility. A
proof-of-principle experiment on MPWA would benefit both terrestrial and
celestial accelerator concepts.

formation channels are considered to be possible and to lead to a variety of
helium-burning subdwarfs. All seismic models to date, however, assume that a
subdwarf B star is a post-helium-flash-core surrounded by a thin inert layer of
hydrogen. We examine an alternative formation channel, in which the subdwarf B
star originates from a massive (>~2 Msun) red giant with a non-degenerate
helium-core. Although these subdwarfs may evolve through the same region of the
log g-Teff diagram as the canonical post-flash subdwarfs, their interior
structure is rather different. We examine how this difference affects their
pulsation modes and whether it can be observed.
  Using detailed stellar evolution calculations we construct subdwarf B models
from both formation channels. The iron accumulation in the driving region due
to diffusion, which causes the excitation of the modes, is approximated by a
Gaussian function. The pulsation modes and frequencies are calculated with a
non-adiabatic pulsation code. A detailed comparison of two subdwarf B models
from different channels, but with the same log g and Teff, shows that their
mode excitation is different. The excited frequencies are lower for the
post-flash than for the post-non-degenerate subdwarf B star. This is mainly due
to the differing chemical composition of the stellar envelope. A more general
comparison between two grids of models shows that the excited frequencies of
most post-non-degenerate subdwarfs cannot be well-matched with the frequencies
of post-flash subdwarfs. In the rare event that an acceptable seismic match is
found, additional information, such as mode identification and log g and Teff
determinations, allows us to distinguish between the two formation channels.

non-trivial problem due to the presence of Gribov copies. In particular, there
are different gauges in the non-perturbative regime which all correspond to the
same definition of a gauge in the perturbative domain. Gauge-dependent
correlation functions may differ in these gauges. Two such gauges are the
minimal and absolute Landau gauge, both corresponding to the perturbative
Landau gauge. These, and their numerical implementation, are described and
presented in detail. Other choices will also be discussed.
  This investigation is performed, using numerical lattice gauge theory
calculations, by comparing the propagators of gluons and ghosts for the minimal
Landau gauge and the absolute Landau gauge in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is
found that the propagators are different in the far infrared and even at energy
scales of the order of half a GeV. In particular, also the finite-volume

timelike or lightlike, particles can be annihilated but not created at a future
spacelike singularity, and created but not annihilated at a past spacelike
singularity. It is argued that in the presence of future (past) spacelike
singularities, there is a unique natural Bohm-like evolution law directed to
the future (past). This law differs from the one in non-singular space-times
mainly in two ways: it involves Fock space since the particle number is not
conserved, and the wave function is replaced by a density matrix. In
particular, we determine the evolution equation for the density matrix, a
pure-to-mixed evolution equation of a quasi-Lindblad form. We have to leave
open whether a curvature cut-off needs to be introduced for this equation to be

the Alfven and nonlinear times with both a global and a spectral definition.
The nonlinear dynamics of strongly magnetized flows is characterized by a
different k_perp-spectrum (where B_0 defines the parallel direction) if it is
plotted at a fixed k_// (2D spectrum) or if it is integrated (averaged) over

with a steep power law, closer to the wave turbulence prediction than the
Kolmogorov one like in the latter case. It is believed that the averaging

turbulence in natural plasmas. For the first time, the formation of filaments
is reported within current and vorticity sheets in strongly magnetized flows

identification allows next to select a family of multifractal processes, namely
the Compound Poisson Cascades, that can synthesize artificial images having
some of the scale-invariance properties observed on the recorded images.
  The prevalence of self-similarity in Quiet Sun coronal images makes it
relevant to study the ratio between the SNR present at SoHO/EIT images and in
coarsened images. SoHO/EIT images thus play the role of 'high resolution'
images, whereas the 'low-resolution' coarsened images are rebinned so as to
simulate a smaller angular resolution and/or a larger distance to the Sun. For
a fixed difference in angular resolution and in Spacecraft-Sun distance, we
determine the proportion of pixels having a SNR preserved at high resolution
given a particular increase in effective area. If scale-invariance continues to
prevail at smaller scales, the conclusion reached with SoHO/EIT images can be
transposed to the situation where the resolution is increased from SoHO/EIT to
SO/HRI resolution at perihelion.

described by a set of different techniques. Polarized microscopy was used to
study the mesomorphic behavior as a function of time. Differential scanning
calorimetry was utilized to quantitatively monitor changes in the latent heat

Infrared spectroscopy was applied to detect the formation of hydrogen bonding
between surfactants. The X-ray diffraction patterns fingerprinted the molecular
arrangement in different emerging phases. Infra-red spectroscopy was used to
monitor the state of hydrogen bonding in the system. We conclude that in both
inverted-lamellar and sub-alpha crystalline phases, monoglyceride molecules
inevitably lose their emulsified ability in the hydrophobic solutions through
the gradual change in hydrogen bonding patterns. On aging, the formation of
intermolecular hydrogen bonding between glycerol groups causes the segregation
of chiral (D and L) isomers within the bilayers. Therefore all structures were
eventually forced to reorder into the beta-crystalline state, distinguishing
between the D and L layers. Accordingly, the highly ordered packing of aged
structures weakened the emulsifying ability and finally leaded the collapse of
the percolating gel network.

frozenness, which is a measure of the extent to which a node prefers one of the

the spectral function in addition to the hump present at the energies of the

with $t_\perp$, with the quasi-particle residuum $Z$ behaving like $- (\ln

the wide range of energy scales given by the plasmon energy and the width of

requirement, the system undergoes violent oscillations, resulting in a partial
evaporation of mass. The leftover particles phase separate into a core-halo
structure. The theory presented allows us to quantitatively predict the amount
and the distribution of mass left in the central core, without any adjustable
parameters. On a longer time scale $\tau_G \sim N$ collisionless relaxation
leads to a gravothermal collapse.

from evaporating primordial black holes have been calculated by assuming that
the photospheric and chromospheric effects are negligible. The technique of
searching for such bursts on shower arrays is described. We show that the burst
time profile and the array dead time should be taken into account to interpret
experimental data. Based on data from the Andyrchy array of the Baksan Neutrino
Observatory (Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences), we

(Li+) is studied in the framework of post collisional Coulomb distorted eikonal
approximation (CDEA) for the target elastic case . The present model takes
account of the two center effect on the ejected e which is crucial for a proper
description of the projectile ionization involving an ionic target. Both the
fully differential (TDCS) and the doubly differential (DDCS) cross sections
(energy spectra) are investigated at intermediate and high incident energies. A
broad distinct Electron loss peak (ELP) centered around v_e ~ v_p is noted in
the e energy spectrum in contrast to the sharp ELP for a heavy projectile. Two
salient features are noted in the present study: i) the shift of the e DDCS
peak (summed over e+ angles) towards higher ejection energy with respect to
half the residual energy of the system, ii) comparison of the e& e+ energy
spectra reflect a strong e - e+ asymmetry with respect to the ratio v_e/v_p =1
>. Both these features could be attributed to the post collisional two center
effect on the e due to its parent nucleus (e+) and the screened target ion .
Two different wave functions of the Li ion are chosen in order to test the
sensitivity of the present results with respect to the choice of the wave
function.

study folding and functions of proteins and RNA. Drawing largely on the methods
developed in our group over the last twenty years, we describe a number of key
applications ranging from folding of proteins with disulfide bonds to functions
of molecular machines. After presenting the theoretical basis that justifies
the use of CG models, we explore the biophysical basis for the emergence of a
finite number of folds from lattice models. The lattice model simulations of
approach to the folded state show that non-native interactions are relevant
only early in the folding process - a finding that rationalizes the success of
structure-based models that emphasize native interactions. Applications of
off-lattice $C_{\alpha}$ and models that explicitly consider side chains
($C_{\alpha}$-SCM) to folding of $\beta$-hairpin and effects of macromolecular
crowding are briefly discussed. Successful application of a new class of
off-lattice model, referred to as the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP), is shown by
describing the response of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to mechanical force.
The utility of the SOP model is further illustrated by applications that
clarify the functions of the chaperonin GroEL and motion of the molecular motor
kinesin. We also present two distinct models for RNA, namely, the Three Site
Interaction (TIS) model and the SOP model, that probe forced unfolding and
force quench refolding of a simple hairpin and {\it Azoarcus} ribozyme. The
predictions based on the SOP model show that force-induced unfolding pathways
of the ribozyme can be dramatically changed by varying the loading rate. We
conclude with a discussion of future prospects for the use of coarse-grained
models in addressing problems of outstanding interest in biology.

and assess fluxes of resulting ENA in the heliosphere. Methods: The model
treats the heavy ions as test particles convected by (and in a particular case
also diffusing through) a hydrodynamically calculated background plasma flow,
from 1 AU to the termination shock (TS), to heliosheath (HS) and finally to
heliospheric tail (HT). The ions undergo radiative and dielectronic
recombinations, charge exchanges, photo- and electron impact ionizations with
plasma particles, interstellar neutral atoms (calculated on a Monte-Carlo
model) and solar photons. Results: Highly-charged heavy coronal ions flowing
with the solar wind undergo successive de-ionizations, mainly in the
heliosheath, leading to charge-states much lower than in the supersonic solar
wind. If Coulomb scattering is the main ion energy loss mechanism, the end
product of these deionizations are fluxes of ENA of ~1 keV/nucleon originating
in the upwind heliosheath that for C, Mg, Si and S may constitute sources of
pickup ions (PUI) significantly exceeding the interstellar supply. Conclusions:
Discussed processes result in (i) distinct difference of ion charge q in the
supersonic solar wind (approximately q >= +Z/2, Z = atomic number) compared to
that in the HS (approximately 0 <= q <= +Z/2)), (ii) probable concentration of
singly ionized atoms (q = +1) in the heliosheath towards the heliopause (HP)
and in the HT, (iii) possible significant production of ENA in the HS offering
natural explanation for production of PUI, and -- after acceleration at the TS
-- anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) of species (like C, Mg, Si, S) unable to enter
the heliospheric cavity from outside because of their total ionization in the
local interstellar medium.

transverse exchange, the model reduces to an antiferromagnetic Ising model that
besides Neel order harbors regions of extensive ground state degeneracy. In the
quantum regime, we find a dimerized phase of triplet states, separated from the
Neel ordered phase by a superfluid. The quantum phase transitions between these
phases are characterized. The magnetization process shows a magnetization
plateau at 1/3 of the saturation value, that persists down to the Ising limit,
and a further plateau at 1/2 only in the quantum regime. For both plateaus, we
determine the crystalline patterns of the localized triplet excitations. No
further plateaus nor supersolid phases are found in this model.
