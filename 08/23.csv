also appear in the TTF- TCNQ spectral-weight distribution are derived. In
addition, the PDT expressions are generalized for electronic densities in the
vicinity of half filling. Further details on the processes involved in the
applications to TTF-TCNQ are reported. Our results are useful for the further

z~1 and in the local stellar disc and halo have opened a new window into the
study of isotopic abundance patterns and the origin of the chemical elements.
Using our Galactic chemical evolution code GEtool, we have examined the

have three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required,
in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the Milky Way; second, to
test the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high-redshift require an
initial mass function biased towards massive stars; and third, to test extant
chemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes that
suggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes with
metallicity. Based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modelling
of a Milky Way-like system, and the subsequent comparison with these new and
unique datasets, we conclude the following: novae are not required to
understand the evolution of 12C/13C in the solar neighbourhood; a massive
star-biased initial mass function is consistent with the low ratios of 12C/13C
and 32S/34S seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequent
super-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this system
seems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted to
correlate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the new
datasets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the Milky Way
(and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantial
overhaul to be made consistent.

proved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer

  Let H be a subgroup of G. It is possible to define a stable module category
of G relative to H. It too is a triangulated category, but no non-trivial
examples have been known where this relative stable category was compactly
generated.
  We show here that the relative stable category is compactly generated if the
group algebra of H has finite representation type. In characteristic p, this is
equivalent to the Sylow p-subgroups of H being cyclic.

for granted the existence of acoustic ion waves in plasmas. An effective black
holes (BH) in curved Riemannian spacetime in a random walk plasmas is endowed
with a naked singularity, when plasmas are in the lowest diffusion mode. The
plasma particle diffusion is encoded in the effective metric. The diffusive
solution has a horizon when the plasma flow reaches the sound velocity in the
medium and a shock wave is obtained inside the slab. The sonic black hole
curved Riemannian metric is also found in terms of particle number density in
plasmas. The sonic BH singularity is found at the center of the plasma
diffusive slab from the study of the Ricci curvature scalar for constant
diffusion coefficient. It is suggested and shown that the Hawking temperature
is proportional to the plasma Kelvin temperature through diffusion coefficient
dependence to this temperature. Therefore Unruh sonic or dumb BH is shown to
have a relation between Hawking and plasma diffusive temperatures. BH
evaporation is analogous to the diffusive phenomena in plasmas, since in both
cases Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass. It is shown that
Hawking analogue temperature of a plasma torus is
$T_{H}(torus)\approx{10^{-4}K}$ which is much higher than the gravitational
Hawking temperature of a one solar mass BH, ${T_{H}}^{GR}\approx{10^{-8}K}$,
but still very small for being detectable in plasma laboratories.

integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, respectively. Based on this framework, we first
compute their effects on observed source fluctuations, separating them as two
physically distinct origins: the volume effect that involves the change of
volume and is always present in galaxy two-point statistics, and the source
effect that depends on the intrinsic properties of source populations. Then we
identify several terms that are ignored in the standard method, and we compute

full sample is strongly contaminated by AGN. The sBzK and pBzK galaxies have
similar levels of radio flux, SFR and specific SFR (SSFR) at z < 1.4,
suggesting there is strong contamination of the pBzK sample by star-forming
galaxies. At z > 1.4, pBzK galaxies become difficult to detect in the radio
stack, though the implied SFRs are still much higher than expected for
passively evolving galaxies. Their radio emission may come from low-luminosity
AGN. EROs straddle the passive and star-forming regions of the BzK diagram and
also straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties. K-bright ERO
samples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ERO samples contain more
star-forming galaxies. The star-formation history (SFH) from stacking all K
sources in the UDS agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and other

possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is
required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum
transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon
diffusion). To this end we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic
MHD code HARM from axisymmetry to full 3D. The use of an energy conserving
algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion
to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling
function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness
as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the
radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic
ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers.
For a disk with aspect ratio H/r ~ 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin
parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that
predicted by the classical Novikov-Thorne model. However, much of it occurs
deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can
strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with
these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic
energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model,
the net luminosi ty reaching infinity is 6% greater than the Novikov-Thorne
prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total
luminosity of the accretion flow would be ~20% greater than the Novikov-Thorne
value.

sources, one source shows periodic variation and one source exhibited a short,
bright X-ray outburst. The periodicity is transient, suggesting it is produced
by a neutron star in an elliptical orbit around a stellar wind source. We
analyze the flaring source in several segments to look for spectral variation
and discuss the implications of the findings for the nature of the source. We
conclude that all four sources in our sample can be identified with the

of stars around a massive black hole (MBH) has two branches: the known weak
segregation solution (Bahcall & Wolf 1977), and a newly discovered strong
segregation solution, presented here. The nature of the solution depends on the
heavy-to-light stellar mass ratio M_H/M_L and on the unbound population number
ratio N_H/N_L, through the relaxational coupling parameter \Delta=4 N_H M_H^2
/[N_L M_L^2(3+M_H/M_L)]. When the heavy stars are relatively common
(\Delta>>1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient
self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form n \propto
r^{-\alpha_M} mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices \alpha_H=7/4 for
the heavy stars and 3/2<\alpha_L<7/4 for the light stars (i.e.
\max(\alpha_H-\alpha_L)~=1/4). However, when the heavy stars are relatively
rare (\Delta<<1), they scatter mostly on light stars, sink to the center by
dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with 2~<\alpha_H<11/4,
while the light stars form a 3/2<\alpha_L<7/4 cusp, resulting in strong
segregation (i.e. \max(\alpha_H-\alpha_L)~=1). We show that the present-day
mass function of evolved stellar populations (coeval or continuously star
forming) with a universal initial mass function, separate into two distinct
mass scales, ~1 Mo of main sequence and compact dwarfs, and ~10 Mo of stellar
black holes (SBHs), and have \Delta<0.1. We conclude that it is likely that
many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated. We review indications of
strong segregation in observations of the Galactic Center and in results of
numeric simulations, and briefly list some possible implications of a very high
central concentration of SBHs around a MBH.

suggests that the glueball component must be diluted quite strongly among the
known scalar mesons. Finally we review the current best continuum determination

a combined sample of 303 field L dwarfs, we find observationally that
7.6+/-1.6% are younger than 100 Myr. This percentage is in agreement with
theoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. We find
that these young L dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (Dec < 0 deg)
and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, young
associations like Tucana-Horologium, TW Hydrae, beta Pictoris, and AB Doradus.
We use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty
6300-10000 Angstrom spectra of L and T dwarfs taken with the Low-Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory to examine the strength of
the 6708-A Li I line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate the
trends noted by Kirkpatrick et al. (2000). We use our low-gravity spectra to
investigate the strength of the Li I line as a function of age. The data weakly
suggest that for early- to mid-L dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum for
a few 100 Myr, whereas for much older (few Gyr) and much younger (<100 Myr) L
dwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. We show that a weakening of lithium
at lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effect
partially corroborated by existing observational data. Larger samples
containing L dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test this
empirically. If verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited in
Kirkpatrick et al. (2006) that the lithium test should be used with caution

Collider (LHC). However when sparticles are produced the signatures of their
production will to a significant degree depend on their hierarchical mass
patterns. Here we investigate hierarchical mass patterns for the four lightest
sparticles within one of the leading candidate theories - the SUGRA model.
Specifically we analyze the hierarchies for the four lightest sparticles for
the mSUGRA as well as for a general class of supergravity unified models
including nonuniversalities in the soft breaking sector. It is shown that out
of nearly $10^4$ possibilities of sparticle mass hierarchies, only a small
number survives the rigorous constraints of radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking, relic density and other experimental constraints. The signature space
of these mass patterns at the LHC is investigated using a large set of final
states including multi-leptonic states, hadronically decaying $\tau$s, tagged
$b$ jets and other hadronic jets. In all, we analyze more than 40 such lepton
plus jet and missing energy signatures along with several kinematical
signatures such as missing transverse momentum, effective mass, and invariant
mass distributions of final state observables. It is shown that a composite
analysis can produce significant discrimination among sparticle mass patterns
allowing for a possible identification of the source of soft breaking. While
the analysis given is for supergravity models, the techniques used in the
analysis are applicable to wide class of models including string and brane

a dense molecular cloud adjacent to an HII region that contains an embedded OB

its envelope of molecular gas, but our line of sight to the central stars is
largely obscured by intervening dust. Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible
at optical, infrared, or cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that
heats the HII region. The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a
small number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at
various wavelengths, but the lower mass stellar population remains largely
unexamined. Despite its modest optical appearance, at 600pc W40 is one of the
nearest massive star forming regions, and with a UV flux of about 1/10th of the

construct binary or multi-valued logic circuitry with arbitrary number N of
logic values by using analog circuitry. Moreover, the logic values on a single
wire can be made a (weighted) superposition of the N distinct logic values.
Fuzzy logic is also naturally represented by a two-component superposition

suppressed. Other relevant advantages are reduced energy dissipation and
leakage current problems, and robustness against circuit noise and background
noises such as 1/f, Johnson, shot and crosstalk noise. Variability problems are
also nonexistent because the logic value is an AC signal. A similar logic
system can be built with orthogonal sinusoidal signals (different frequency or
orthogonal phase) however that has an extra 1/N type slowdown compared to the
noise-based logic system with increasing number of N furthermore it is less
robust against time delay effects than the noise-based counterpart.

a challenging statistical task. The Poisson nature of the photon counts leads
to local random fluctuations in the observed spectrum that often results in
excess emission in a narrow band of energy resembling a weak narrow line. From
a formal statistical perspective, this leads to a (sometimes highly) multimodal
likelihood. Many standard statistical procedures are based on (asymptotic)
Gaussian approximations to the likelihood and simply cannot be used in such
settings. Bayesian methods offer a more direct paradigm for accounting for such
complicated likelihood functions but even here multimodal likelihoods pose
significant computational challenges. The new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods developed in 2008 by van Dyk and Park, however, are able to fully
explore the complex posterior distribution of the location of a narrow line,
and thus provide valid statistical inference. Even with these computational
tools, standard statistical quantities such as means and standard deviations
cannot adequately summarize inference and standard testing procedures cannot be
used to test for emission lines. In this paper, we use new efficient MCMC
algorithms to fit the location of narrow emission lines, we develop new
statistical strategies for summarizing highly multimodal distributions and
quantifying valid statistical inference, and we extend the method of posterior
predictive p-values proposed by Protassov et al. (2002) to test for the
presence of narrow emission lines in X-ray spectra. We illustrate and validate
our methods using simulation studies and apply them to the Chandra observations

the (undirected) graph with vertices
${\Bbb{A}}(R)^*:={\Bbb{A}}(R)\setminus\{(0)\}$, and two distinct vertices $I$
and $J$ are adjacent if and only if $IJ=(0)$. First, we study some finiteness
conditions of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. For instance, it is shown that if $R$ is not a
domain, then ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ has ACC (resp., DCC) on vertices if and only if
$R$ is Noetherian (resp., Artinian). Moreover, the set of vertices of
${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ and the set of nonzero proper ideals of $R$ have the same
cardinality when $R$ is either an Artinian or a decomposable ring. This yields
for a ring $R$, ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ has $n$ vertices $(n\geq 1)$ if and only if $R$
has only $n$ nonzero proper ideals. Next, we study the connectivity of
${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. It is shown that ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ is a connected graph and
$diam(\Bbb{AG})(R)\leq 3$ and if ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ contains a cycle, then
$gr({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq 4$. Also, rings $R$ for which the graph ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$
is complete or star, are characterized, as well as rings $R$ for which every
vertex of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ is a prime (or maximal) ideal. In Part II we shall
study the diameter and coloring of annihilating-ideal graphs.

simplest and most objective analysis of observation leads to progress. A
complementary approach tests the prediction of models against observation. In
practise, astrophysics has few real theories, and has little control over what
we can observe. Compromise is unavoidable. Advances in understanding complex
non-linear situations, such as galaxy formation, require that models attempt to
isolate key physical properties, rather than trying to reproduce complexity. A

commutative rings, that was introduced in Part I (see [5]). Let $R$ be a
commutative ring with ${\Bbb{A}}(R)$ its set of ideals with nonzero annihilator
and $Z(R)$ its set of zero divisors. The annihilating-ideal graph of $R$ is
defined as the (undirected) graph ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ that its vertices are

complete characterization for the possible diameter is given exclusively in
terms of the ideals of $R$ when either $R$ is a Noetherian ring or $Z(R)$ is
not an ideal of $R$. Next, we study coloring of annihilating-ideal graphs.
Among other results, we characterize when either $\chi({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq 2$ or
$R$ is reduced and $\chi({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq \infty$. Also it is shown that for
each reduced ring $R$, $\chi(\Bbb{AG}(R))= cl(\Bbb{AG}(R))$. Moreover, if

increase in nonradiative decay. For the first time, we manage to obtain the

Mach number perpendicular shocks is investigated through the two-dimensional
linear analysis and electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The
simulations are double periodic and taken as a proxy for the situation in the
foot. The linear analysis for relatively cold unmagnetized plasmas with a
reflected proton beam shows that obliquely propagating Buneman instability is
strongly excited. We also found that when the electron temperature is much
higher than the proton temperature, the most unstable mode is the highly
obliquely propagating ion two-stream instability excited through the resonance
between ion plasma oscillations of the background protons and of the beam
protons, rather than the ion acoustic instability that is dominant for parallel
propagation. To investigate nonlinear behavior of the ion two-stream
instability, we have made PIC simulations for the shock foot region in which
the initial state satisfies the Buneman instability condition. In the first
phase, electrostatic waves grow two-dimensionally by the Buneman instability to
heat electrons. In the second phase, highly oblique ion two-stream instability
grows to heat mainly ions. This result is in contrast to previous studies based
on one-dimensional simulations, for which ion acoustic instability further
heats electrons. The present result implies that overheating problem of
electrons for shocks in supernova remnants is resolved by considering ion
two-stream instability propagating highly obliquely to the shock normal and
that multi-dimensional analysis is crucial to understand the particle heating
and acceleration processes in shocks.

electron beam with virtual no spatial spreading or diffraction, without a
waveguide or external magnetic field, can be achieved in graphene under an
appropriate class of experimentally feasible one-dimensional external periodic
potentials. The novel chiral quasi-one-dimensional metallic state that the
charge carriers are in originates from a collapse of the intrinsic helical
nature of the charge carriers in graphene owing to the superlattice potential.
Beyond providing a new way to constructing chiral one-dimensional states in two

fluorescence quenching leads to degradation of the ASE signal. Whatever the
degradation route, a high concentration of DO11 is required and the polymer
