stock markets for the two-year period 2001-02 and analyze their return
intervals $\tau$, which are time intervals between volatilities above a given
threshold $q$. We explore the probability density function of $\tau$,
$P_q(\tau)$, assuming a stretched exponential function, $P_q(\tau) \sim
e^{-\tau^\gamma}$. We find that the exponent $\gamma$ depends on the threshold
in the range between $q=1$ and 6 standard deviations of the volatility. This
finding supports the multiscaling nature of the return interval distribution.
To better understand the multiscaling origin, we study how $\gamma$ depends on
four essential factors, capitalization, risk, number of trades and return. We
show that $\gamma$ depends on the capitalization, risk and return but almost
does not depend on the number of trades. This suggests that $\gamma$ relates to
the portfolio selection but not on the market activity. To further characterize
the multiscaling of individual stocks, we fit the moments of $\tau$, $\mu_m
\equiv <(\tau/<\tau>)^m>^{1/m}$, in the range of $10 < <\tau> \le 100$ by a
power-law, $\mu_m \sim <\tau>^\delta$. The exponent $\delta$ is found also to
depend on the capitalization, risk and return but not on the number of trades,
and its tendency is opposite to that of $\gamma$. Moreover, we show that
$\delta$ decreases with $\gamma$ approximately by a linear relation. The return
intervals demonstrate the temporal structure of volatilities and our findings
suggest that their multiscaling features may be helpful for portfolio
optimization.

with the remainder in Cha II. The current census of Cha I contains 237 known

Approximately 50 members of Cha II have been identified, including a few brown
dwarfs. When interpreted with the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe,
the H-R diagram for Cha I exhibits a median age of ~2 Myr, making it coeval
with IC 348 and slightly older than Taurus (~1 Myr). The IMF of Cha I reaches a
maximum at a mass of 0.1-0.15 M_sun, and thus closely resembles the IMFs in IC
348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. The disk fraction in Cha I is roughly
constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3 M_sun and increases to ~65% at higher masses.
In comparison, IC 348 has a similar disk fraction at low masses but a much
lower disk fraction at M>1 M_sun, indicating that solar-type stars have longer
disk lifetimes in Cha I.

small velocity allows to access the critical behavior at the depinning

the corrections to the critical force, and the joint probability distribution

for any velocity. For 2-dimensional disorder, we perform large-scale numerical
simulations to calculate the renormalized force correlator tensor
Delta_{ij}(u), and to extract the anisotropic scaling exponents zeta_x >

the frequency ranges of 131--160 GHz, 219--244 GHz, and 252--268 GHz with
typical sensitivity limit of T_R<10 mK. A total of 74 individual emission
features are detected, of which 69 are identified to arise from 21 molecular
species and isotopologues, with 5 faint lines remaining unidentified. Two new
molecules (C4H and CH3CN) and seven new isotopologues (C17O, 29SiC2, 29SiO,
30SiO, 13CS, C33S, and CS) are detected in this object for the first time. The
column densities, excitation temperatures, and fractional abundances of the
detected molecules are determined using rotation diagram analysis. Comparison
of the spectra of CIT 6 to that of IRC+10216 suggests that the spectral
properties of CIT 6 are generally consistent with those of IRC+10216. For most
of the molecular species, the intensity ratios of the lines detected in the two
objects are in good agreement with each other. Nevertheless, there is evidence
suggesting enhanced emission from CN and HC3N and depleted emission from HCN,
SiS, and C4H in CIT 6. Based on their far-IR spectra, we find that CIT 6
probably has a lower dust-to-molecular gas ratio than IRC+10216. To investigate
the chemical evolution of evolved stars, we compare the molecular abundances in
the AGB envelopes CIT 6 and IRC+10216 and those in the bright proto-planetary

the scalar field gravity theory have. To demonstrate these, we obtain, by using
a slightly modified form of the Matos-Nunez algorithm, an extended class of
asymptotically flat wormhole solutions belonging to Einstein minimally coupled
scalar field theory. Generally, solutions in these theories do not represent
traversable wormholes due to the occurrence of curvature singularities.
However, the Ellis I solution of the Einstein minimally coupled theory, when
Wick rotated, yields Ellis class III solution, the latter representing a
singularity-free traversable wormhole. We see that Ellis I and III are not
essentially independent solutions. The Wick rotated seed solutions, extended by
the algorithm, contain two new parameters a and \delta;. The effect of the
parameter a on the geodesic motion of test particles reveals some remarkable
features. By arguing for Sagnac effect in the extended Wick rotated solution,
we find that the parameter a can indeed be interpreted as a rotation parameter
of the wormhole. The analyses reported here have wider applicability in that
they can very well be adopted in other theories, including in the string
theory.

It constitutes the first result proving the existence of non-stationary vacuum
black holes arising from asymptotically flat initial data dynamically
approaching a stationary solution. In fact, we show quantitative rates of
approach. The proof relies on vectorfield multiplier estimates, which are used
in conjunction with a bootstrap argument to establish polynomial decay rates
for the radiation on the perturbed spacetime. Despite being applied here in a
five-dimensional context, the techniques are quite robust and may admit
applications to various four-dimensional stability problems.

start from a three-orbital Hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice and derive
its low-energy effective Hamiltonian by an approach of real-space
renormalization group type. One important tetrahedron configuration in the
rochlore lattice has a three-fold orbital degeneracy and spin S=1, and
correspondingly, the effective Hamiltonian has spin and orbital exchange
interactions of Kugel-Khomskii type as well as correlated electron hoppings.
Analyzing the effective Hamiltonian, we find that ferromagnetic double exchange
processes compete with antiferromagnetic superexchange processes and various
spin and orbital exchange processes are competing to each other. These results
suggest the absence of phase transition in spin and orbital spaces down to very
low temperatures and their large fluctuations in the low-energy sector, which
are key issues for understanding the heavy fermion behavior in LiV_2O_4.
