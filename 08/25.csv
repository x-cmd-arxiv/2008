Under increasing nanoparticle temperature, the heat flux saturates which is in
sharp contrast with the case of flat interfaces, where a critical heat flux is
observed followed by development of a vapor layer and heat flux drop. These
differences in heat transfer are explained by the curvature induced pressure
close to the nanoparticle, which inhibits boiling. When the nanoparticle
temperature is much larger than the critical fluid temperature, a very large
temperature gradient develops resulting in close to ambient temperature just

the effective Hamiltonian in the intermediate coupling regime. In order to
improve on the quantitative description of magnetic excitations in the
insulating antiferromagnetic phase of copper-oxide (cuprate) materials, and to
be consistent with band structure calculations and photoemission experiments on

find systematically the effective Hamiltonian and any operator in the spin-only
representation. The results include all closed, four hop electronic pathways in
the canonical transformation. The method generates many ring exchange terms
that play an important role in the comparison with experiments on La2CuO4.
Performing a spin wave analysis, we calculate the magnon dispersion as a
function of U,t,t' and t''. The four parameters are estimated by fitting the
magnon dispersion to the experimental results of Coldea et al. [Phys. Rev.

essential, in particular to determine the relative sign of t' and t'', with the

sublattice magnetization is calculated using these parameters and also found to
be in good agreement with the experimental value estimated by Lee et al. [Phys.

radiations in blazar jets to include external Compton processes. The basic
model assumption is that the blazar radio through soft X-ray flux is nonthermal
synchrotron radiation emitted by isotropically-distributed electrons in the
randomly directed magnetic field of outflowing relativistic blazar jet plasma.
Thus the electron distribution is given by the synchrotron spectrum, depending
only on the Doppler factor $\delta_{\rm D}$ and mean magnetic field $B$, given
that the comoving emission region size scale $R_b^\prime \lesssim c \dD
t_v/(1+z)$, where $t_v$ is variability time and $z$ is source redshift.
Generalizing the approach of Georganopoulos, Kirk, and Mastichiadis (2001) to
arbitrary anisotropic target radiation fields, we use the electron spectrum
implied by the synchrotron component to derive accurate Compton-scattered
$\gamma$-ray spectra throughout the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes for
external Compton scattering processes. We derive and calculate accurate
$\gamma$-ray spectra produced by relativistic electrons that Compton-scatter
(i) a point source of radiation located radially behind the jet, (ii) photons
from a thermal Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk and (iii) target photons from the
central source scattered by a spherically-symmetric shell of broad line region
(BLR) gas. Calculations of broadband spectral energy distributions from the
radio through $\gamma$-ray regimes are presented, which include self-consistent
$\gamma\gamma$ absorption on the same radiation fields that provide target
photons for Compton scattering. Application of this baseline flat spectrum
radio/$\gamma$-ray quasar model is considered in view of data from $\gamma$-ray

hyperbolic trajectories. We estimate the transfer probability in a stellar
cluster as a function of stellar mass and cluster size. We find that
significant amounts of solid material could potentially have been transferred
from the early Solar System to our nearest neighbor stars. While this low
velocity mechanism improves the odds for interstellar lithopanspermia, the
exchange of biologically active materials across stellar systems depends
greatly upon the highly uncertain viability of organisms over the timescales
for transfer, typically millions of years.

interval plays the role of time variable, whereas the physical time is treated
as the analog of spatial variable. In this way we found that the fluctuations
of many real-world time series satisfy the analog of the Family-Viscek dynamic
scaling ansatz. This finding permits to use the powerful tools of kinetic
roughening theory to classify, model, and forecast the fluctuations of

to more than two pairs of entangled qubits at the same time with high

single-photon two-qubit quantum logic to a partially hyperentangled four-qubit

number of charge and spin interactions. To illustrate this Hamiltonian we
consider two examples and use a renormalization group technique to evaluate the
ground state phases. The first example is a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs.
We find that increasing the number of interactions in such a two-leg ladder may
result in a richer phase diagram, particularly at half-filling where a few
exotic phases are possible when the number of interactions are large and the
angle of the zigzag is small. In the second example we determine under which
conditions a two-leg ladder at quarter-filling is able to support a
Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase. We show that this is only possible when the
spin interactions across the rungs are ferromagnetic. In both examples we focus
on lithium purple bronze, a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs which is though
to support a Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase.

more energy is emitted from the disk in a wormhole geometry than in the case of
the Schwarzschild potential and the conversion efficiency of the accreted mass
into radiation is more than a factor of two higher for the wormholes than for
static black holes. These effects in the disk radiation are confirmed in the
radial profiles of temperature corresponding to the flux distributions, and in
the emission spectrum \omega L(\omega) of the accretion disks. We conclude that
specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the
possibility of distinguishing wormhole geometries by using astrophysical
observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks.

describe them. In all sciences, besides quantum physics, all correlations are
described by either of two mechanisms. Either a first event influences a second
one by sending some information encoded in bosons or molecules or other
physical carriers, depending on the particular science. Or the correlated
events have some common causes in their common past. Interestingly, quantum
physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations,
named entanglement. This new kind of cause reveals itself, e.g., in
correlations that violate Bell inequalities (hence cannot be described by
common causes) between space-like separated events (hence cannot be described
by classical communication). Einstein branded it as spooky action at a
distance. A real spooky action at a distance would require a faster than light
influence defined in some hypothetical universally privileged reference frame.
Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical
influences. We performed a Bell test during more than 24 hours between two
villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the
source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed 2-photon
interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the
Earth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine,
for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of this
spooky influence. For instance, if such a privileged reference frame exists and
is such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10^-3 that of the
speed of light, then the speed of this spooky influence would have to exceed
that of light by at least 4 orders of magnitude.

but an interesting resource for information processing, for instance in
communication-complexity theory or cryptography. An important question in this
context is whether the resource can be distilled: Given a large amount of weak
non-local correlations, is there a method to obtain strong non-locality using
local operations and shared randomness? We partly answer this question by no:
CHSH-type non-locality, the only possible non-locality of binary systems, which
is not super-strong, but achievable by measurements on certain quantum states,
has at best very limited distillability by any non-interactive classical
method. This strongly extends and generalizes what was previously known, namely
that there are two limits that cannot be overstepped: The Bell and Tsirelson
bounds. Moreover, our results imply that there must be an infinite number of
such bounds.
  A noticeable feature of our proof of this purely classical statement is that
it is quantum mechanical in the sense that (both novel and known) facts from
quantum theory are used in a crucial way to obtain the claimed results. One of
these results, of independent interest, is that certain mixed entangled states
cannot be distilled without communication. Weaker statements, namely limited
distillability, have been known for Werner states.

soft and/or collinear. This can expressed in terms of antenna functions which
are much simpler than the full amplitudes and yet correctly embody their
infrared behaviour. We show how antenna functions can be naturally obtained via
a twistor-inspired MHV approach. As an application, we present compact results
for MHV and NMHV antennas functions valid for any number of gluons. These are
sufficient to calculate the complete set of tree-level gluon antenna functions
up to NNNLO. As an interesting corollary, we prove that splitting amplitudes
too can be written directly through a MHV diagrammatic approach. Finally we
find that antenna functions, collinear splitting amplitudes and eikonal factors
satisfy the same kind of recursive relation as the full amplitudes.

that the function-coding information quantity of a genome always grows in the

transfer from outside. The function-coding information quantity of a genome
consists of two parts, p-coding information quantity which encodes functional
protein and n-coding information quantity which encodes other functional
elements except amino acid sequence. The evidences on the evolutionary law
about the function-coding information quantity are listed. The needs of
function is the motive force for the expansion of coding information quantity

247 as E(B-V)=0.13 mag, which brings the true distance modulus determinations
from the V and I bands into excellent agreement with the distance determination
in the Wesenheit index. The best estimate for the true distance modulus of NGC
247 from our optical Cepheid photometry is 27.80 $\pm$0.09 (internal error)
$\pm$ 0.09 mag (systematic error) which is in excellent agreement with other
recent distance determinations for NGC 247 from the Tip of the Red Giant branch
method, and from the Tully-Fisher relation. The distance for NGC 247 places
this galaxy at twice the distance of two other Sculptor Group galaxies, NGC 300

this group of galaxies. The reported distance value is tied to an assumed LMC

second Higgs doublet ($\eta$), odd under the discrete parity symmetry $Z_2$,
Majorana neutrino masses can be generated at 1-loop order. In the resulting
model, the lightest stable particle, either a boson or a fermion, might be a
dark matter candidate. Here we assume a specific mass spectrum ($M_1\ll M_2 <
M_3 < m_\eta$) and derive its consequences for dark matter and collider
phenomenology. We show that (i) the lightest right-handed neutrino is a warm
dark matter particle that can give a $\sim$10% contribution to the dark matter
density; (ii) several decay branching ratios of the charged scalar can be
predicted from measured neutrino data. Especially interesting is that large
lepton flavour violating rates in muon and tau final states are expected.
Finally, we derive upper bounds on the right-handed neutrino Yukawa couplings
from the current experimental limit on $Br(\mu\to e\gamma)$.

dependent radiation field in a one dimensional infinite medium with
monochromatic, isotropic scattering for sources with an arbitrary spatial
distribution and an arbitrary time variation of their power. The Lax-Wendroff
method seems to be the most suitable. Because it is assumed that radiation
delay is caused by the finite speed of light, the following difficulty arises
when the numerical method is used: the region of variation of the variables
(dimensionless coordinate \tau and time t) is triangular (the inequality \tau<
t). This difficulty is overcome by expanding the unknown functions in series in
terms of small values of the time and coordinate. By comparing the numerical
and exact solutions for a point source with a given time dependence for its
power and with pure scattering, the steps in the variables required to obtain a
desired accuracy are estimated. This numerical method can be used to calculate
the intensity and polarization of the radiation from sources in the early

dependence on phase variables. According to a proposal by T. Ratiu,
discretizations of the Hirota-Kimura type can be considered for numerous
integrable systems of classical mechanics. Due to a remarkable and not well
understood mechanism, such discretizations seem to inherit the integrability
for all algebraically completely integrable systems. We introduce an
experimental method for a rigorous study of integrability of such

functionally independent integrals of motion of this discrete time system,
which turn out to be much more complicated than the integrals of the continuous

that the low-temperature linear term in the specific heat is due to a glassy

tunneling systems in the crystal. We propose that dislocation related defects
produce those tunneling systems. Further, we argue that the reported putative
mass decoupling, that means an increase in the oscillator frequency, is
consistent with a glass-like transition. The glass scenario offers an
alternative interpretation of the torsional oscillator experiments in contrast
to the supersolid scenario of nonclassical rotational inertia.

a multiplicative internal noise. Moreover, the system is subjected to an
external additive noise which mimics the influence of the environment of the
tumor. The stationary probability distribution Ps is derived depending on the
finite correlation time, the immunization rate and the strength of the

increasing immunization rate. The mean-first passage time is also calculated in

analysis reveals a very soft spectrum with multiple temperature components
(1--6MK) and an X-ray flux slightly below the `canonical' value
(log[L_X(0.1-10.)/L_{BOL}] ~ -7). The X-ray lines appear surprisingly narrow

intensities confirm the anomalous abundances detected in the optical domain (C
strongly depleted, N strongly enriched, O slightly depleted). In addition, the
X-ray data favor a slight depletion in neon and iron, but they are less
conclusive for the magnesium abundance (solar-like?). While no significant
changes occur during the XMM-Newton observation, variability in the X-ray

ascribed to both thixotropy and aging. However, there is no consensus for which
phenomenon is the origin of which changes. A novel thixotropic model is defined
that incorporates aging. Conditions under which viscosity changes are due to
thixotropy and aging are unambiguously defined. Viscosity changes in a complex
fluid during a period of rest after destructuring exhibit a bifurcation at a
critical volume fraction PHIc2. For volume fractions less than PHIc2, the
viscosity remains finite in the limit t => infinite. For volume fractions above
critical the viscosity grows without limit, so aging occurs at rest. At
constant shear rate there is no bifurcation, whereas under constant shear
stress the model predicts a new bifurcation in the viscosity at a critical
stress sB, identical to the yield stress sy observed under steady conditions.
The divergence of the viscosity for stress s sB is best defined as aging.
However, for s > sB, where the viscosity remains finite, it seems preferable to
use the concepts of restructuring and destructuring, rather than aging and
rejuvenation. Nevertheless, when a stress sA (sB) is applied during aging,
slower aging is predicted and discussed as true rejuvenation. Plastic behaviour
is predicted under steady conditions when s > sB. The Herschel-Bulkley model
fits the flow curve for stresses close to sB, whereas the Bingham model gives a
better fit for s >> sB. Finally, the model's predictions are shown to be
consistent with experimental data from the literature for the transient
behaviour of laponite gels.

cold dust in the disks of all three galaxies of 17-20 K, comparable to the dust
temperatures in the disk of the Milky Way. The total gas mass in the three
galaxies is determined to be 2.1, 4.2 and 2.8 x 10^9 solar masses for NGC253,
NGC4945 and NGC5128, respectively. A detailed comparison between the gas masses
derived from the dust continuum and the integrated CO(1-0) intensity in NGC253

are mainly driven by a metallicity gradient and only to a lesser degree by
variations of the CO excitation. An analysis of the synchrotron spectrum in the

to the ultraviolet wavelengths is well described by a broken power law and that

develop customizable ""atoms"". Functionalization by attaching single strands of
DNA allows for direct control of the binding between nanoparticles, since
hybridization of double strands will only occur if the base sequences of single
strands are complementary. Nanoparticles and colloids functionalized by four
single strands of DNA can be thought of as designed analogs to tetrahedral
network forming atoms and molecules, with a difference that the attached DNA
strands allow for control of the length scale of bonding relative to the core
size. We explore the behavior of an experimentally realized model for a
nanoparticles functionalized by four single strands of DNA (a tetramer), and
show that this single-component model exhibits a rich phase diagram with at
least three critical points and four thermodynamically distinct amorphous
phases. We demonstrate that the additional critical points are part of the
Ising universality class, like the ordinary liquid-gas critical point. The
dense phases consist of a hierarchy of interpenetrating networks, reminiscent
of a woven cloth. Thus bonding specificity of DNA provides an effective route
to generate new nano-networked materials with polyamorphic behavior. The
concept of network interpenetration helps to explain the generation of multiple
liquid phases in single-component systems, suggested to occur in some atomic
and molecular network forming fluids, including water and silica.

in the solar neighborhood. They are grouped in loose young associations,
sharing similar kinematical and physical properties, but, due to their vicinity
to the Sun, they are dispersed in the sky, and hard to identify. Their strong
stellar coronal activity, causing enhanced X-ray emission, allows them to be
identified as counterparts of X-ray sources. The analysis presented here is
based mainly on the SACY project, aimed to survey in a systematic way
counterparts of ROSAT all-sky X-ray sources in the Southern Hemisphere for
which proper motions are known. We give the definition, main properties, and
lists of high-probability members of nine confirmed loose young associations
that do not belong directly to the well-known Oph-Sco-Cen complex. The youth
and vicinity of many members of these new associations make them ideal targets
for follow-up studies, specifically geared towards the understanding of
planetary system formation. Searches for very low-mass and brown dwarf
companions are ongoing, and it will be promising to search for planetary
companions with next generation instruments.

explored within the approach consisting of the hydrodynamics of perfect fluid
followed by statistical hadronization. It is found that for the RHIC initial
conditions the very same framework that reproduces the standard soft
observables (including the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow, and
the azimuthally-averaged HBT radii) leads to a proper description of the
azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopic observables - we find that the azimuthal
variation of the side and out HBT radii is very well reproduced for all
centralities, while the out-side correlation is somewhat too large for
non-central events. Concerning the dependence of the femtoscopic parameters on
kT we find that it is very well reproduced for the out and side radii, and
fairly well for the long radius. The model is then extrapolated for the LHC
energy. We predict the overall moderate growth of the HBT radii and the
decrease of their azimuthal oscillations. Such effects are naturally caused by
longer evolution times. In addition, we discuss in detail the space-time
patterns of particle emission. We show that they are quite complex and argue
that the overall shape seen by the femtoscopic methods cannot be easily
disentangled on the basis of simple-minded arguments.

multi-component generalizations of the sine-Gordon equation. When M is of
definite signature their solutions describe classical bosonic string
configurations on the curved space-time R_t\times M. In contrast, if M is of
indefinite signature the solutions to those equations can describe bosonic
string configurations on R_t\times M, M\times S^1_\vartheta or simply M. The
conditions required to enable the Lagrangian formulation of the resulting

time-dependent voltage and identify the elementary transport processes. At zero
temperature unidirectional and bidirectional single charge transfers occur. The
unidirectional processes involve electrons injected from the source terminal
due to excess dc bias voltage. The bidirectional processes involve
electron-hole pairs created by time-dependent voltage bias. This interpretation
is further supported by the charge transfer statistics in a multiterminal beam
splitter geometry in which injected electrons and holes can be partitioned into
different outgoing terminals. The probabilities of elementary processes can be
probed by noise measurements: the unidirectional processes set the dc noise
level while bidirectional ones give rise to the excess noise. For ac voltage
drive, the noise oscillates with increasing the driving amplitude. The
decomposition of the noise into the contributions of elementary processes
identifies the origin of these oscillations: the number of electron-hole pairs
generated per cycle increases with increasing the amplitude. The decomposition
of the noise into elementary processes is studied for different time-dependent
voltages. The method we use is also suitable for systematic calculation of
higher-order current correlators at finite temperature. We obtain current noise
power and the third cumulant in the presence of time-dependent voltage drive.
The charge transfer statistics at finite temperature can be interpreted in
terms of multiple charge transfers with probabilities which depend on energy
and temperature.

that the electric-charge neutrality plays a similar role as the repulsive
vector interaction; they both weaken the first-order chiral phase transition in
the high-density and low-temperature region. The first-order chiral phase
transition is not affected, however, at finite temperatures where the diquark
condensate melts. In this way the chiral phase transition could be second-order
at intermediate temperatures if the diquark effects overwhelm the chiral
dynamics, while the first-order transition may survive at lower and higher
temperatures. The number of the critical points appearing on the phase diagram
can vary from zero to three, which depends on the relative strength of the
chiral and diquark couplings. We systematically study the possibility of the
phase structure with multiple QCD critical points and evaluate the Meissner

high temperatures. Relaxation of these stresses leads to a series of
corrections to the free energy that may be taken to any desired order, up to
self-consistency. Here we show how to correct the elastic constants obtained
using the SC-QHA. We exemplify the procedure by correcting to first order the
elastic constants of MgSiO$_3$-perovskite and MgSiO$_3$-post-perovskite, the
major phases of the Earth's lower mantle. We show that this first order
correction is quite satisfactory for obtaining the aggregated elastic averages
of these minerals and their velocities in the lower mantle. This type of
correction is also shown to be applicable to experimental measurements of
elastic constants in situations where deviatoric stresses can develop, such as
in diamond anvil cells.
