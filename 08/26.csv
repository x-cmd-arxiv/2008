incorporates other flavor observables such as the branching ratio of B_s -> mu+
mu-, the branching ratio of B -> tau nu_tau, the branching ratio of B -> D tau
nu_tau, the branching ratio of K -> mu nu_mu and the branching ratios of D_s ->
tau nu_tau and D_s -> mu nu_mu. The calculation of the branching ratio of B ->
X_s gamma is also improved, as it includes NNLO Standard Model contributions.
The program also computes the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). Nine sample
models are included in the package, namely SM, 2HDM, and mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and
GMSB for the MSSM, and CNMSSM, NGMSB and NNUHM for the NMSSM. SuperIso uses a
SUSY Les Houches Accord file (SLHA1 or SLHA2) as input, which can be either
generated automatically by the program via a call to external spectrum
calculators, or provided by the user. The calculation of the observables is
detailed in the Appendices, where a suggestion for the allowed intervals for
each observable is also provided.

(HB). The steep well-defined RGB is indicative of a metal-poor system while the
HB is populated predominantly redward of the RR Lyrae instability strip.
Utilizing Galactic globular cluster fiducial sequences as a reference, we
calculate a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.20 +/- 0.15 and a distance of
(m-M)0 = 24.57 +/- 0.04 after adopting a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.16. This metal
abundance places And V squarely in the absolute magnitude - metallicity diagram
for dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In addition, if we attribute the entire
error-corrected color spread of the RGB stars to an abundance spread, we
estimate a range of ~0.5 dex in the metallicities of And V stars. Our analysis
of the variable star population of And V reveals the presence of 28 potential
variables. Of these, at least 10 are almost certainly RR Lyrae stars based on
their time sequence photometry.

in observations as well as in numerical simulations. Recently an epicyclic
theory for the formation of these clumps was presented. A quantitative analysis
was still missing. We present a quantitative derivation of the angular momentum
and energy distribution of escaping stars from a star cluster in the tidal
field of the Milky Way and derive the connection to the position and width of
the clumps. For the numerical realization we use star-by-star $N$-body
simulations. We find a very good agreement of theory and models. We show that
the radial offset of the tidal arms scales with the tidal radius, which is a
function of cluster mass and the rotation curve at the cluster orbit. The mean
radial offset is 2.77 times the tidal radius in the outer disc. Near the
Galactic centre the circumstances are more complicated, but to lowest order the
theory still applies. We have also measured the Jacobi energy distribution of
bound stars and showed that there is a large fraction of stars (about 35%)
above the critical Jacobi energy at all times, which can potentially leave the
cluster. This is a hint that the mass loss is dominated by a self-regulating
process of increasing Jacobi energy due to the weakening of the potential well
of the star cluster, which is induced by the mass loss itself.

penumbra showing bright filaments of about 2 to 3 Mm length with central dark
lanes. By a process similar to the formation of umbral dots, the penumbral
filaments result from magneto-convection in the form of upflow plumes, which
become elongated by the presence of an inclined magnetic field: the upflow is
deflected in the outward direction while the magnetic field is weakened and
becomes almost horizontal in the upper part of the plume near the level of
optical depth unity. A dark lane forms owing to the piling up of matter near
the cusp-shaped top of the rising plume that leads to an upward bulging of the
surfaces of constant optical depth. The simulated penumbral structure
corresponds well to the observationally inferred interlocking-comb structure of
the magnetic field with Evershed outflows along dark-laned filaments with
nearly horizontal magnetic field and overturning perpendicular (`twisting')
motion, which are embedded in a background of stronger and less inclined field.
Photospheric spectral lines are formed at the very top and somewhat above the
upflow plumes, so that they do not fully sense the strong flow as well as the
large field inclination and significant field strength reduction in the upper

The recently-discovered

previously-identified stable zone that separates the three close-in planets
from planet d at 5.9 AU. Here we map the stability of the orbital space between
planets f and d using a suite of n-body integrations that include an
additional, yet-to-be-discovered planet g with a radial velocity amplitude of 5
m/s (planet mass = 0.5-1.2 Saturn masses). We find a large stable zone
extending from 0.9 to 3.8 AU at eccentricities below 0.4. For each system we
quantify the probability of detecting planets b-f on their current orbits given
perturbations from hypothetical planet g, in order to further constrain the
mass and orbit of an additional planet. We find that large perturbations are
associated with specific mean motion resonances (MMRs) with planets f and d. We
show that two MMRs, 3f:1g (the 1:3 MMR between planets g and f) and 4g:1d
cannot contain a planet g. The 2f:1g MMR is unlikely to contain a planet more
massive than about 20 Earth masses. The 3g:1d and 5g:2d MMRs could contain a
resonant planet but the resonant location is strongly confined. The 3f:2g,
2g:1d and 3g:2d MMRs exert a stabilizing influence and could contain a resonant
planet. Furthermore, we show that the stable zone may in fact contain 2-3
additional planets, if they are ~50 Earth masses each. Finally, we show that
any planets exterior to planet d must reside beyond 10 AU.

the microphysical viscosity in order to accomodate the observational need for

replacing the microphysical transport coefficient by a single turbulent
transport coeffi- cient hides the fact that the procedure should formally arise
as part of a closure in which the hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic equations
are averaged, and correlations of turbulent fluctuations are replaced by
transport coefficients. Here we show how a mean field approach leads quite
naturally two transport coefficients, not one, that govern mass and angular
momentum transport. In particular, we highlight that the conventional approach
suffers from a seemingly inconsistent neglect of turbulent diffusion in the
surface density equation. We constrain these new transport coefficients for
specific cases of inward, outward, and zero net mass transport. In addition, we
find that one of the new transport terms can lead to oscillations in the mean
surface density which then requires a constant or small inverse Rossby number
for disks to maintain a monotonic power-law surface density.

infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagator in SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge
theories. The latter are in good agreement with the most recent lattice data
obtained at large volumes, both in 4D and in 3D. More precisely, the gluon
propagator is suppressed and does not vanish at zero momentum, while the ghost
propagator keeps a 1/p^2 behaviour for p^2\approx0. Instead, in 2D, the lattice
data revealed a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator and an infrared
enhanced ghost, in support of the usual Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. We will now
show that the 2D version of the Gribov-Zwanziger action still gives results in
qualitative agreement with these lattice data, as the peculiar infrared nature

correlation analysis based on bursts detected by the Swift mission. For the
first time, short and long bursts can be analyzed and compared. It is found for
both classes that the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearly
correlated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger bursts
tend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter X-ray afterglow tend
to have brighter optical afterglow. Short bursts are, on average, weaker in
both prompt and afterglow emissions. No short bursts are seen with extremely
low optical to X-ray ratio as occurs for ""dark"" long bursts. Although
statistics are still poor for short bursts, there is no evidence yet for a
subgroup of short bursts with high extinction as there is for long bursts. Long
bursts are detected in the dark category at the same fraction as for pre-Swift
bursts. Interesting cases are discovered of long bursts that are detected in
the optical, and yet have low enough optical to X-ray ratio to be classified as
dark. For the prompt emission, short and long bursts have different average
tracks on flux vs fluence plots. In Swift, GRB detections tend to be fluence
limited for short bursts and flux limited for long events.

independent of the models for gravity, dark energy, or galaxy properties. For
Gaussian fluctuations the 2-point model determines the survey likelihood
function and allows Fisher-matrix forecasting. The framework includes nuisance
terms for the major systematic errors: shear measurement errors, magnification
bias and redshift calibration errors, intrinsic galaxy alignments, and
inaccurate theoretical predictions. We propose flexible parameterizations of
the many nuisance parameters related to galaxy bias and intrinsic alignment.
For the first time we can integrate many different observables and systematic
errors into a single analysis. As a first application of this framework, we
demonstrate that: uncertainties in power-spectrum theory cause very minor
degradation to cosmological information content; nearly all useful information
(excepting baryon oscillations) is extracted with ~3 bins per decade of angular
scale; and the rate at which galaxy bias varies with redshift substantially
influences the strength of cosmological inference. The framework will permit
careful study of the interplay between numerous observables, systematic errors,

identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative
hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in
particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of
clusters of galaxies, and a determination of their content of gravitationally
bound stars, dark matter, and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of
cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo
substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in
particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics,
and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic
outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as
artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is
efficiently stripped from subhalos when they enter the highly pressurized
cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function
relative to a corresponding dark matter-only simulation. These effects are
mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo
regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very
small fraction, of the order of one percent, of subhalos within the cluster
virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere.

mag galaxies, over 1.5 sq. deg. of the COSMOS field. We quantify the degree of
passivity of the LIRG and ULIRG environments by analysing the fraction of close
neighbours with Dn(4000)>1.4. We find that LIRGs at 0.6<z<0.8 live in more
passive environments than those of other optical galaxies that have the same
stellar mass distribution. Instead, ULIRGs inhabit more active regions (e.g.
LIRGs and ULIRGs at 0.6<z<0.8 have, respectively, (42.0 +/- 4.9)% and (24.5 +/-
5.9)% of neighbours with Dn (4000)>1.4 within 1 Mpc and +/- 500 km/s). The
contrast between the activities of the close environments of LIRGs and ULIRGs
appears especially enhanced in the COSMOS field density peak at z~0.67, because
LIRGs on this peak have a larger fraction of passive neighbours, while ULIRGs
have as active close environments as those outside the large-scale structure.
The differential environmental activity is related to the differences in the
distributions of stellar mass ratios between LIRGs/ULIRGs and their close
neighbours, as well as in the general local density fields. At 0.8<z<1.0,
instead, we find no differences in the environment densities of ULIRGs and
other similarly massive galaxies, in spite of the differential activities. We
discuss a possible scenario to explain these findings.

positions and proper motions from the NOMAD catalog. Based mainly on measures
of chromospheric and X-ray activity, age estimation is obtained for most of 85
identified companions. Color -- absolute magnitude diagrams are constructed to
test if CPM companions are physically related to the primary nearby stars and
have the same age. Our carefully selected sample includes three remote white
dwarf companions to main sequence stars and two systems (55 Cnc and GJ 777A) of
multiple planets and distant stellar companions. Ten new CPM companions,
including three of extreme separations, are found. Multiple hierarchical
systems are abundant; more than 25% of CPM components are spectroscopic or

discovered among nearby CPM companions, GJ 264 and HIP 59000 and preliminary
orbital solutions are presented. The Hyades kinematic group (or stream) is

paradigm. Some of the multiple stellar systems with remote CPM companions
probably undergo the dynamical evolution on non-coplanar orbits, known as the

rigorous manner. Such models can readily be derived by coarsening the
discretization size in the solution of the governing PDEs, increasing the time
step when integration of ODEs is performed, using fewer iterations if a
non-linear solver is employed or making use of lower order models. It is shown
that even in cases where the inexact models provide very poor approximations of
the exact response, statistics of the latter can be quantified accurately with
significant reductions in the computational effort. Multiple approximate models
can be used and rigorous confidence bounds of the estimates produced are
provided at all stages.

We take advantage of a basic property of the walker configuration distribution
generated in a DMC calculation, to (i) project-out a multi-determinant
expansion of the fixed-node ground-state wave function and (ii) to define a
cost function that relates the fixed-node ground-state and the non-interacting
trial wave functions. We show that (a) locally smoothing out the kink of the
fixed-node ground-state wave function at the node generates a new trial
wave-function with better nodal structure and (b) we argue that the noise in
the fixed-node wave-function resulting from finite sampling plays a beneficial
role, allowing the nodes to adjust towards the ones of the exact many-body
ground state in a simulated annealing-like process. We propose a method to
improve both single determinant and multi-determinant expansions of the trial
wave-function. We test the method in a model system where benchmark
configuration interaction calculations can be performed. Comparing the DMC
calculations with the exact solutions, we find that the trial wave-function is
systematically improved. The overlap of the optimized trial wave function and
the exact ground state converges to 100% even starting from wave-functions
orthogonal to the exact ground state. In the optimization process we find an
optimal non-interacting nodal potential of density-functional-like form whose
existence was predicted earlier[Phys.Rev. B {\bf 77}, 245110 (2008)]. We obtain

enormous experimental efforts to pin down its value and its time variation. Yet
it is the single most important handle we have in our understanding of one of
the most mysterious puzzle in nature, dark energy. This letter proposes a new
method for measuring the EoS of dark energy by using the gravitational waves
(GW) of black hole binaries. The method described here offers an alternative to
the standard way of large scale surveys.
  It is well known that the mass of a black hole changes due to the accretion
of dark energy but at an extremely slow rate. However, a binary of supermassive
black holes (SBH) radiates gravitational waves with a power proportional to the
masses of these accreting stars and thereby carries information on dark energy.
These waves can propagate through the vastness of structure in the universe
unimpeded. The orbital changes of the binary, induced by the energy loss from
gravitational radiation, receive a large contribution from dark energy
accretion. This contribution is directly proportional to $(1+w)$ and is
dominant for SBH binaries with separation $R \ge 1000$ parsec, thereby
accelerating the merging process for $w > -1$ or ripping the stars apart for
phantom dark energy with $w < -1$. Such orbital changes, therefore $w$, can be
detected with LIGO and LISA near merging time, or with X-ray and radio
measurements of Chandra and VLBA experiments.

dominant, role in the evolution and structure of the bars. We also make
extensive numerical tests of different N-body codes used to study bar dynamics.
Models with thick disks typically used in this type of modeling
(height-to-length ratio hz/Rd=0.2) produce slowly rotating, and very long,
bars. In contrast, more realistic thin disks with the same parameters as in our
Galaxy (hz/Rd= 0.1) produce bars with normal length Rbar approx R_d, which
rotate quickly with the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar radius
1.2-1.4 compatible with observations. Bars in these models do not show a
tendency to slow down, and may lose as little as 2-3 percent of their angular
momentum due to dynamical friction with the dark matter over cosmological time.
We attribute the differences between the models to a combined effect of high
phase-space density and smaller Jeans mass in the thin disk models, which
result in the formation of a dense central bulge. Special attention is paid to
numerical effects such as the accuracy of orbital integration, force and mass
resolution. Using three N-body codes -- Gadget, ART, and Pkdgrav -- we find
that numerical effects are very important and, if not carefully treated, may
produce incorrect and misleading results. Once the simulations are performed
with sufficiently small time-steps and with adequate force and mass resolution,
all the codes produce nearly the same results: we do not find any systematic
deviations between the results obtained with TREE codes (Gadget and Pkdgrav)

incoherent part of the spectrum of light scattered by an atomic system. In the
first, one calculates the spectrum of the total light scattered by the system
and obtains the incoherent part by subtracting the coherent part. In the second
method, one introduces the fluctuation operators and obtains the incoherent
part of the spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the two time
correlation function of the fluctuation operators. These two methods have been
recognized for years as two completely equivalent for evaluating the incoherent
part of the spectrum. In a recent paper Qing Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 013407
(2008)] have shown that there are discrepancies between the incoherent parts of
the stationary spectrum of a three-level Lambda-type system calculated with
these two methods. The predicted discrepancies can be severe that over a wide
rage of the Rabi frequencies and atomic decay rates, the spectrum calculated
with the variance method can have negative values. This is obviously unphysical
result since the fluorescence spectrum is a positively defined quantity. It
represents the frequency distribution of light incoherently scattered by the
atomic system. Therefore, the calculated spectrum should be positive for all
frequencies independent of values of the Rabi frequencies and the damping
rates. In this comment, we show that there are no discrepancies between these
two methods. The equivalence of these two alternative methods leads to the same
incoherent spectra that are positive for all frequencies independent of values
of the parameters involved. The analytical analysis is supported by simple
numerical calculations.

diffusion-reaction equation predicts mass distributions that are in good
agreement with data on 4002 terrestrial mammal from the late Quaternary and
8617 extant bird species. Under this model, we show that a specific tradeoff

produce realistic mass distributions for both taxa. We then make several

impulsive jets propagating in both uniform and inhomogeneous external media are
presented, which show that the resulting dynamics of their remnants since the
onset of the non-relativistic phase is different from the standard self-similar
solutions. Because massive star progenitors are expected to have their close-in
surroundings modified by the progenitor winds, we consider both free winds and
shocked winds as possible external media for GRB remnant evolution. Abundant
confirmation is provided here of the important notion that the morphology and
visibility of GRB remnants are determined largely by their circumstellar
environments. For this reason, their detectability is highly biased in favor of
those with massive star progenitors; although, in this class of models, the
beamed component may be difficult to identify because the GRB ejecta is
eventually swept up by the accompanying SN. The number density of asymmetric
GRB remnants in the local Universe could be, however, far larger if they expand
in a tenuous interstellar medium, as expected for some short GRB progenitor
models. In these sources, the late size of the observable, asymmetric remnant
could extend over a wide, possibly resolvable angle and may be easier to

X-ray activity occurs between the age of the Hyades (~8 x 10^8 yrs) and that of
the Sun, very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between
these ages. To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a
star's intermediate age, we studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9
Gyr old open cluster NGC 752. METHODS. We analysed a ~140 ks Chandra
observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster.
We detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the
XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within
Chandra's field-of-view are detected in the X-ray. The X-ray luminosity of all
observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was
derived. RESULTS. Our data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical
X-ray luminosity of the cluster members with M=0.8-1.2 Msun is Lx = 1.3 x 10^28
erg s^-1, so approximately a factor of 6 less intense than that observed in the
younger Hyades. Given that Lx is proportional to the square of a star's
rotational rate, the median Lx of NGC 752 is consistent, for t > 1 Gyr, to a
decaying rate in rotational velocities v_rot ~ t^-alpha with alpha ~ 0.75,
steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper
than observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha < 0.3),
suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is
taking place at t ~ 1 Gyr.

under which they attain the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and deriving estimates of
their distance. In particular, we show that this bound is attained by codes
constructed on a fixed bipartite graph with a large spectral gap.

an exposure time approximately twice that of EGRET, AGILE confirms the
existence of a prominent gamma-ray source (AGL J1836+5926) at a position
consistent with that of EGRET, although with a remarkably lower average flux
value for photon energies greater than 100 MeV. A 5-day bin temporal analysis
of the whole data set of AGL J1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability of
the gamma-ray flux. The source spectrum between 100 MeV and 1 GeV can be fitted
with a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent with
the EGRET value. The faint X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925 that has been proposed

currently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

depends on the specific requirements of the scientific experiment. If the
correct reproduction of model amplitudes is important, classical damping
towards a smooth model using an $\ell_2$ norm works almost as well as
minimizing the total variation but is much more efficient. If gradients (edges
of anomalies) should be resolved with a minimum of distortion, we prefer
$\ell_1$ damping of Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients. It has the additional
advantage of yielding a noiseless reconstruction, contrary to simple $\ell_2$
minimization (`Tikhonov regularization') which should be avoided. In some of
our examples, the $\ell_0$ method produced notable artifacts. In addition we
show how nonlinear $\ell_1$ methods for finding sparse models can be
competitive in speed with the widely used $\ell_2$ methods, certainly under
noisy conditions, so that there is no need to shun $\ell_1$ penalizations.

gradient of which has such a behavior that it can compete with the gravity. In
a more detail, we find the equation of state in the case when the magnitude of
the potential-type energy of constituting gas particles is much larger than
their rest energy. This equation appears to be identical with the
general-relativity condition of the equilibrium between the gravity and
pressure gradient. The consequences of the identity are discussed.

long-wavelength fluctuations of the metric exhibit hydrodynamic behaviour. For
Einstein's theory, the ratio of the shear viscosity of near-horizon metric
fluctuations eta to the entropy per unit of transverse volume s is eta/s=1/4
pi. We propose that, in generalized theories of gravity, this ratio is given by
the ratio of two effective gravitational couplings and can be different than
1/4 pi. Our proposal implies that eta/s is equal for any pair of gravity
theories that can be transformed into each other by a field redefinition. In
particular, the ratio is 1/4 pi for any theory that can be transformed into
Einstein's theory; such as F(R) gravity. Our proposal also implies that matter
interactions -- except those including explicit or implicit factors of the
Riemann tensor -- will not modify eta/s. The proposed formula reproduces, in a
very simple manner, some recently found results for Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We
also make a prediction for eta/s in Lovelock theories of any order or

sequential patterns in multi-neuronal spike trains. These patterns are
characterized by ordered sequences of spikes from different neurons with
specific delays between spikes. We have previously proposed a data mining
scheme to efficiently discover such patterns which are frequent in the sense
that the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the data stream
is above a threshold. Here we propose a method to determine the statistical
significance of these repeating patterns and to set the thresholds
automatically. The novelty of our approach is that we use a compound null
hypothesis that includes not only models of independent neurons but also models
where neurons have weak dependencies. The strength of interaction among the
neurons is represented in terms of certain pair-wise conditional probabilities.
We specify our null hypothesis by putting an upper bound on all such
conditional probabilities. We construct a probabilistic model that captures the
counting process and use this to calculate the mean and variance of the count
for any pattern. Using this we derive a test of significance for rejecting such
a null hypothesis. This also allows us to rank-order different significant
patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach using spike trains
generated from a non-homogeneous Poisson model with embedded dependencies.

interaction (EPI) has currently arrived. Here I briefly review some
phonon-mediated unconventional pairing mechanisms. In particular the anisotropy
of sound velocity makes the phonon-mediated attraction of electrons non-local
in space providing unconventional Cooper pairs with a nonzero orbital momentum
already in the framework of the conventional BCS theory with weak EPI. In the
opposite limit of strong EPI rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result
of a reduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons. Using the
variational Monte-Carlo method we have found that a relatively weak
finite-range EPI induces a d-wave BCS state also in doped Mott-Hubbard
insulators or strongly-correlated metals. These results tell us that poorly
screened EPI with conventional phonons is responsible for the unconventional

give rise to at least a class of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with
supernovae, a stellar core rapidly passes through a short yet important phase
of neutronization, producing a huge amount of energetic neutrinos and photons
which contribute to the total pressure within the progenitor core. The
collection of neutrinos, photons and gas materials together may be approximated
as a fluid with a polytropic index $\gamma=4/3$ under the action of
self-gravity. With a substantial generalization and using analytical and
numerical methods (Lou & Cao 2008), we recently constructed and examined
various self-similar solutions to describe collapses, rebound shocks and flows
systematically in a $\gamma=4/3$ polytropic gas mixture with spherical
symmetry, and compare our results with those of Goldreich & Weber (1980). It is
also possible to construct central void solutions without or with shocks.
Various features and characteristics of this nonlinear relativistically hot gas
dynamics, including asymptotic and exact solutions, are presented. This more
general polytropic model analysis provides the dynamic basis of understanding
the evolution of rebound shocks in supernovae (SNs) and the results may be also
utilized to benchmark hydrodynamic simulations.

in the coupled waveguides are demonstrated, which occur in the case when the
negative index medium waveguide in isolation guides its mode backward. A new
type of coupled mode solution that varies exponentially with the coupling
length is found in the special case when the propagation constants of two
individual waveguides are nearly the same. A coupler operating in this case is
insensitive to the coupling length, and its coupling efficiency can reach 100%
as long as the coupling length is long enough. However, when the propagation
constants of the two individual waveguides differ greatly, the coupled mode
solution is still a periodic function of the coupling length, but the coupled
power is output backward. In addition, the modes in the composite waveguide

(MPB). Data were obtained between 100 K and 600 K under zero and non-zero
electric field applied along the cubic [001] direction. The lowest energy,
zone-center, transverse optic phonon is strongly damped and softens slowly at
high temperature; however the square of the soft mode energy begins to increase
linearly with temperature as in a conventional ferroelectric, which we term the
soft mode ""recovery,"" upon cooling into the tetragonal phase at TC. Our data
show that the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT behaves almost identically to that in
pure PMN, exhibiting the same temperature dependence and recovery temperature
even though PMN exhibits no well-defined structural transition (no TC). The
temperature dependence of the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT is also similar to that
in PMN-0.60PT; however in PMN-0.60PT the recovery temperature equals TC. These
results suggest that the temperature dependence and the energy scale of the
soft mode dynamics in PMN-xPT are independent of concentration on the Ti-poor
side of the MPB, but scale with TC for Ti-rich compositions. Thus the MPB may
be defined in lattice dynamical terms as the concentration where TC first
matches the recovery temperature of the soft mode. High-resolution x-ray
studies show that the cubic-to-ferroelectric phase boundary shifts to higher
temperatures by an abnormal amount within the MPB region in the presence of an
electric field. This suggests that an unusual instability exists within the
apparently cubic phase at the MPB.
