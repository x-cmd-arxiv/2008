  Parallel Slow Fading Channels",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is the second part of a two-part paper that studies the problem of
jamming in a fixed-rate transmission system with fading. In the first part, we
studied the scenario with a fast fading channel, and found Nash equilibria of
mixed strategies for short term power constraints, and for average power
constraints with and without channel state information (CSI) feedback. We also
solved the equally important maximin and minimax problems with pure strategies.
Whenever we dealt with average power constraints, we decomposed the problem
into two levels of power control, which we solved individually. In this second
part of the paper, we study the scenario with a parallel, slow fading channel,
which usually models multi-carrier transmissions, such as OFDM. Although the
framework is similar as the one in Part I \cite{myself3}, dealing with the slow
fading requires more intricate techniques. Unlike in the fast fading scenario,
where the frames supporting the transmission of the codewords were equivalent
and completely characterized by the channel statistics, in our present scenario
the frames are unique, and characterized by a specific set of channel
realizations. This leads to more involved inter-frame power allocation
strategies, and in some cases even to the need for a third level of power
control. We also show that for parallel slow fading channels, the CSI feedback
helps in the battle against jamming, as evidenced by the significant
degradation to system performance when CSI is not sent back. We expect this
degradation to decrease as the number of parallel channels $M$ increases, until
it becomes marginal for $M\to \infty$ (which can be considered as the case in
Part I).

jamming in a fixed-rate transmission system with fading. Both transmitter and
jammer are subject to power constraints which can be enforced over each
codeword short-term / peak) or over all codewords (long-term / average), hence
generating different scenarios. All our jamming problems are formulated as
zero-sum games, having the probability of outage as pay-off function and power
control functions as strategies. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive
coverage of these problems, under fast and slow fading, peak and average power
constraints, pure and mixed strategies, with and without channel state
information (CSI) feedback. In this first part we study the fast fading
scenario. We first assume full CSI to be available to all parties. For peak
power constraints, a Nash equilibrium of pure strategies is found. For average
power constraints, both pure and mixed strategies are investigated. With pure
strategies, we derive the optimal power control functions for both intra-frame
and inter-frame power allocation. Maximin and minimax solutions are found and
shown to be different, which implies the non-existence of a saddle point. In
addition we provide alternative perspectives in obtaining the optimal
intra-frame power control functions under the long-term power constraints. With
mixed strategies, the Nash equilibrium is found by solving the generalized form
of an older problem dating back to Bell and Cover \cite{bell}. Finally, we
derive a Nash equilibrium of the game in which no CSI is fed back from the
receiver. We show that full channel state information brings only a very slight
improvement in the system's performance.

acoustic energy of optimized perturbations is discovered. An optimal energy
growth $G$ is calculated numerically for a variety of parameters. Its value
depends essentially on the perturbation azimuthal wavenumber $m$ and increases
for higher values of $m$. The closer the rotation profile to the Keplerian law,
the larger growth factors can be obtained but over a longer time. The highest

approach that acquires compute and storage resources dynamically, replicates
data in response to demand, and schedules computations close to data. As demand
increases, more resources are acquired, thus allowing faster response to
subsequent requests that refer to the same data; when demand drops, resources
are released. This approach can provide the benefits of dedicated hardware
without the associated high costs, depending on workload and resource
characteristics. The approach is reminiscent of cooperative caching,
web-caching, and peer-to-peer storage systems, but addresses different
application demands. Other data-aware scheduling approaches assume dedicated
resources, which can be expensive and/or inefficient if load varies
significantly. To explore the feasibility of the data diffusion approach, we
have extended the Falkon resource provisioning and task scheduling system to
support data caching and data-aware scheduling. Performance results from both
micro-benchmarks and a large scale astronomy application demonstrate that our
approach improves performance relative to alternative approaches, as well as
provides improved scalability as aggregated I/O bandwidth scales linearly with

graphene-based nanodevices through optical analogies: From the Bethe and
Kirchhoff-like diffraction patterns in the conductance of graphene slits to the
Fabry-Perot oscillations of the conductance in nanoribbons. We introduce the
concept of {\it electronic diffraction barriers}, which transmission cancels at
the Dirac point. This gives central insight in the properties of Graphene
subwavelength devices including nanoelectronics standard systems, such as

collapse or expansion of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous mass distributions

where nonlinear dynamics (with respect to the FLRW background) induce large
deviations from the FLRW metric. In this paper we show explicitly that this is
a gauge artefact (for realistic sub-horizon inhomogeneities). We write down the
nonlinear gauge transformation from synchronous to Newtonian gauge for a
general LTB solution using the fact that the peculiar velocities are small. In
the latter gauge we recover the solution in the form of a weakly perturbed FLRW
metric that is assumed in standard cosmology. Furthermore we show how to obtain
the LTB solutions directly in Newtonian gauge and illustrate how the Newtonian

perturbation theory breaks down. Finally we discuss the implications of our
results for the backreaction scenario.

spectroscopy (FFS) of five young massive clusters in M83 (NGC 5236). This forms
the basis of a pilot study testing the feasibility of using FFS to measure the
velocity dispersions of several clusters simultaneously, in order to determine
their dynamical masses; Methods: We adopted two methods for determining the
velocity dispersion of the star clusters: cross-correlating the cluster
spectrum with the template spectra and minimising a chi^2 value between the
cluster spectrum and the broadened template spectra. Cluster 805 in M83 was
chosen as a control to test the reliability of the method, through a comparison
with the results obtained from a standard echelle VLT/UVES spectrum obtained by
Larsen & Richtler; Results: We find no dependence of the velocity dispersions
measured for a cluster on the choice of red giant versus red supergiant
templates, nor on the method adopted. We measure a velocity dispersion of
sigma_los = 10.2+/-1.1 km/s for cluster 805 from our FFS. Our FLAMES+UVES
velocity dispersion measurement gives M_vir = (6.6+/-1.7)e5 M_sun, consistent
with previous results. This is a factor of ~3 greater than the cluster's
photometric mass, indicating a lack of virial equilibrium. However, based on
its effective star formation efficiency, the cluster is likely to virialise,
and may survive for a Hubble time, in the absence of external disruptive
forces; Conclusions: We find that reliable velocity dispersions can be
determined from FFS. The advantages of observing several clusters
simultaneously outweighs the difficulty of accurate galaxy background
subtraction, providing that the targets are chosen to provide sufficient S/N
ratios, and are much brighter than the galaxy background.

the sense that we try to identify the essential ingredients to reproduce the

tend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization;
analysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which
governs the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to
situations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time
stability (on average). The Stylized Facts are shown to correspond to an
intermittent behavior which occurs only for a finite value of the number of
agents N. Therefore they correspond to finite size effect which, however, can
occur at different time scales. We propose a new mechanism for the
Self-Organization of this state which is linked to the existence of a threshold
for the agents to be active or not active. The feedback between price
fluctuations and number of active agents represent a crucial element for this
state of Self-Organized-Intermittency. The model can be easily generalized to
consider more realistic variants.

scale distances above the central planes of edge-on, galaxy discs was an
unexpected discovery about 20 yrs ago. Subsequent observations showed that this
EDIG (extended or extraplanar diffuse interstellar gas) has rotation velocities
approximately 10-20% lower than those in the central plane, and have been hard
to account for. Here we present results of hydrodynamic models, with radiative
cooling and heating from star formation. We find that in models with star
formation generated stochastically across the disc an extraplanar gas layer is
generated as long as the star formation is sufficiently strong. However, this
gas rotates at nearly the same speed as the mid-plane gas. We then studied a
range of models with imposed spiral or bar waves in the disc. EDIG layers were
also generated in these models, but primarily over the wave regions, not over
the entire disc. Because of this partial coverage, the EDIG clouds move
radially, as well as vertically, with the result that observed kinematic
anomalies are reproduced. The implication is that the kinematic anomalies are
the result of three-dimensional motions when the cylindrical symmetry of the
disc is broken. Thus, the kinematic anomalies are the result of bars or strong
waves, and more face-on galaxies with such waves should have an asymmetric EDIG
component. The models also indicate that the EDIG can contain a significant
fraction of cool gas, and that some star formation can be triggered at
considerable heights above the disc midplane. We expect all of these effects to
be more prominent in young, forming discs, to play a role in rapidly smoothing
disc asymmetries, and in working to self-regulate disc structure.

fundamentalist agents, chartist agents, herding dynamics and price behavior.
The first two elements correspond to the competition between stability and
instability tendencies in the market. The herding behavior governs the
possibility of the agents to change strategy and it is a crucial element of
this class of models. The linear approximation permits a simple interpretation
of the model dynamics and, for many properties, it is possible to derive
analytical results. The generalized non linear dynamics results to be extremely
more sensible to the parameter space and much more difficult to analyze and
control. The main results for the nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized
Facts are, however, very similar in the two cases. The main peculiarity of the
non linear dynamics is an enhancement of the fluctuations and a more marked
evidence of the Stylized Facts. We will also discuss some modifications of the

the acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated
by just K << N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic
samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers
the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS
dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K))
measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing
robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple
sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the
values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a
model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides
concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with
provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class
of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for
robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted
amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted
isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant
signal models - wavelet trees and block sparsity - into two state-of-the-art CS
recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M=O(K)

populations because the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies in the
1-2.5\mum range is dominated by different types of stars than at optical
wavelengths. Furthermore, NIR data are subjected to less absorption and hence
could constrain the stellar populations in dust-obscured galaxies. We want to
develop observational constraints on the stellar populations of unresolved
stellar systems in the NIR. To achieve this goal we need a benchmark sample of
NIR spectra of ``simple'' early-type galaxies, to be used for testing and
calibrating the outputs of population synthesis models. We obtained
low-resolution (R~1000) long-slit spectra between 1.5 and 2.4\mum for 14 nearby
early-type galaxies using SofI at NTT and higher resolution (R~3000) long-slit
spectra, centered at the MgI at ~1.51\mum for a heterogeneous sample of 5
nearby galaxies observed with ISAAC at VLT. We defined spectral indices for CO,
NaI, CaI and MgI features and measured the strengths of these features in the
sample galaxies. We defined a new global NIR metallicity index, suitable for
abundance measurements in low-resolution spectra. Finally, we present an
average NIR spectrum of an early-type galaxy, built from a homogenized subset
of our sample. The NIR spectra of the sample galaxies show great similarity and
the strength of some features does correlate with the iron abundance [Fe/H] and
optical metal features of the galaxies. The data suggest that the NIR metal
features, in combination with a hydrogen absorption feature may be able to
break the age-metallicity degeneracy just like the Mg and Fe features in the
optical wavelength range.

negative cosmological constant, these theories have static, electrically
charged, and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Those theories with
well formulated asymptotics are studied through a Hamiltonian formalism, and
their thermodynamical properties are found. The theories studied are general
relativity, a dimensionally reduced cylindrical four-dimensional general
relativity theory, and a theory representing a class of theories, all with a
Maxwell term. The Hamiltonian formalism is setup in three dimensions through
foliations on the right region of the Carter-Penrose diagram, with the
bifurcation 1-sphere as the left boundary, and anti-de Sitter infinity as the
right one. The metric functions on the hypersurfaces and the radial component
of the vector potential one-form are the canonical coordinates. The Hamiltonian
action is written, the Hamiltonian being a sum of constraints. One finds a new
action which yields an unconstrained theory with two pairs of canonical
coordinates ${M,P_M; Q,P_Q}$, where $M$ is the mass parameter, which needs
renormalization, $P_M$ its conjugate momenta, $Q$ is the charge parameter, and
$P_Q$ its conjugate momentum. The resulting Hamiltonian is a sum of boundary
terms only. A quantization of the theory is performed. The Schr\""odinger
evolution operator is constructed, the trace is taken, and the partition
function of the grand canonical ensemble is obtained, the chemical potential
being the electric potential. The charged black hole entropies differ, in
general, from the usual quarter of the horizon area due to the dilaton.

the optically-thin approximation are inappropriate for computing Eddington
factors for the problem of cosmological reionization. We evolve the
non-equilibrium ionization field via an efficient and accurate (errors <1%)
technique that switches between fully implicit or explicit finite-differencing
depending on whether the local timescales are long or short compared to the
timestep. We tailor our code for the problem of cosmological reionization. In
tests, the code conserves photons, accurately treats cosmological effects, and
reproduces analytic Stromgren sphere solutions. Its chief weakness is that the
computation time for the long characteristics calculation scales relatively
poorly compared to other techniques (t_{LC} \propto N_{cells}^1.5); however, we
mitigate this by only recomputing the Eddington tensor when the radiation field
changes substantially. Our technique makes almost no physical approximations,
so it provides a way to benchmark faster but more approximate techniques. It
can readily be extended to evolve multiple frequencies, though we do not do so
here. Finally, we note that our method is generally applicable to any problem

theoretical research over the past one and a half decades. Most of the disc
simulations have assumed a small initial magnetic field and studied the
turbulence that arises from the magnetorotational instability. However, gaseous
discs in galactic nuclei and in some binary systems are likely to have
significant initial magnetisation. Motivated by this, we performed ideal
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of strongly magnetised, vertically stratified
discs in a Keplerian potential. Our initial equilibrium configuration, which
has an azimuthal magnetic field in equipartion with thermal pressure, is
unstable to the Parker instability. This leads to the expelling of magnetic
field arcs, anchored in the midplane of the disc, to around five scale heights
from the midplane. Transition to turbulence happens primarily through
magnetorotational instability in the resulting vertical fields, although
magnetorotational shear instability in the unperturbed azimuthal field plays a
significant role as well, especially in the midplane where buoyancy is weak.
High magnetic and hydrodynamical stresses arise, yielding an effective
$\alpha$-value of around 0.1 in our highest resolution run. Azimuthal magnetic
field expelled by magnetic buoyancy from the disc is continuously replenished
by the stretching of a radial field created as gas parcels slide in the linear
gravity field along inclined magnetic field lines. This dynamo process, where
the bending of field lines by the Parker instability leads to re-creation of
the azimuthal field, implies that highly magnetised discs are astrophysically
viable and that they have high accretion rates.

calculated by solving simultaneously the mixing and burning equations within a

theory. We are able to follow chemical evolution during deep-mixing events in
which hydrogen is burned violently, and therefore able to present a homogeneous
set of abundances for different metallicities and varieties of hot-flashers. We
extend the scope of our work by analyzing the effects of non-standard
assumptions, such as the effect of chemical gradients, extra-mixing at
convective boundaries, possible reduction in convective velocities, or the
interplay between difussion and mass loss. Particular emphasis is placed on the
predicted surface properties of the models.
  We find that the hot-flasher scenario is a viable explanation for the
formation and surface properties of He-sdO stars. Our results also show that,
during the early He-core burning stage, element diffusion may produce the
transformation of (post hot-flasher) He-rich atmospheres into He-deficient
ones. If this is so, then we find that He-sdO stars should be the progenitors
of some of the hottest sdB stars.

through the lattice. The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium

chains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such
propagation happens at a finite ""speed of sound"". Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson
theorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are
limited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small
corrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic
models with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove
that one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics
of the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than
any finite speed of sound. The effect is only limited by the model's range of
validity (eventually by relativity). It also implies that in non-equilibrium
dynamics of strongly correlated bosonic models far-away regions may become
quickly entangled, suggesting that their simulation may be much harder than
that of spin chains even in the low energy sector.

the density of ~100 resonances per Tesla for collisions of molecules in the
absolute ground state. This suggests that the scattering length of ultracold
molecules in the absolute ground state can be effectively tuned in a very wide
range of magnetic fields. Our calculations demonstrate that the number and
properties of the magnetic Feshbach resonances are dramatically different for

In this paper, we study the existence of exceptional (random) values of \tau

absolute magnitudes and the logarithms of the linear diameters of galaxies
located within 10 Mpc. Surprisingly this observed power-law relationship
appears to be almost independent of environment and local mass density as
defined by Karachentsev & Malakov. However, at a given luminosity, early-type
galaxies are (on average) slightly more compact than are objects of a later
type. Unexpectedly the present results appear to indicate that the
luminosity-diameter relation for the galaxies within 10 Mpc is
indistinguishable from what is observed in the much denser Virgo cluster.

of using the infrared regime to convert single-lined spectra into double-lined

used for a number of young, low-mass binaries. For RX J0529.3+1210, a long-
period(462 days) and highly eccentric(0.88) binary system, we determine the
mass ratio to be 0.78+/-0.05 using the infrared double-lined velocity data
alone, and 0.73+/-0.23 combining visible light and infrared data in a full
orbital solution. The large uncertainty in the latter is the result of the
sparse sampling in the infrared and the high eccentricity: the stars do not
have a large velocity separation during most of their ~1.3 year orbit. A mass
ratio close to unity, consistent with the high end of the one sigma uncertainty
for this mass ratio value, is inconsistent with the lack of a visible light
detection of the secondary component. We outline several scenarios for a color
difference in the two stars, such as one heavily spotted component, higher
order multiplicity, or a unique evolutionary stage, favoring detection of only
the primary star in visible light, even in a mass ratio ~1 system. However, the
evidence points to a lower ratio. Although RX J0529.3+1210 exhibits no excess
at near-infrared wavelengths, a small 24 micron excess is detected, consistent
with circumbinary dust. The properties of this binary and its membership in
Lambda Ori versus a new nearby stellar moving group at ~90 pc are discussed. We
speculate on the origin of this unusual system and on the impact of such high
eccentricity on the potential for planet formation.

is discovered to be of deficiency in two aspects: the internal Friedmann
space-time does not have the inherent symmetry and cannot connect to the
external Schwarzschild space-time. So the process of gravitational collapse
described by this solution is doubtful. The deficiency, together with the
singularity problem, result from the imperfection of the field theory in
continuous space-time, which is expressed by the infinite precision function
theory. The space-time structure of the Oppenheimer and Snyder dust ball is
founded to be discrete rather than continuous, and to describe the field theory
in discrete space-time it requires a function theory with finite precision.
Based on the i order real number and its equivalence class, which is defined in
the real number field, the infinite precision function theory is extended to
the finite precision function theory. The Einstein field equations are
expressed in the form of finite precision, and then the collapsing dust ball
solution in continuous space-time is modified to a static ball solution in
discrete space-time. It solves all the problems of Oppenheimer and Snyder
solution and shows that, with Planck length and Planck time as space-time
quantum, a mechanism to resist the gravitational collapse could be obtained by
the discretization of space-time.

In the
first half of the work, we investigate M-theory compactifications on spaces
with co-dimension four, orbifold singularities. We construct M-theory on
C^2/Z_N by coupling 11-dimensional supergravity to a seven-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory located on the orbifold fixed-plane. The resulting action is
supersymmetric to leading non-trivial order in the 11-dim Newton constant. We
thereby reduce M-theory on a G2 orbifold with C^2/Z_N singularities, explicitly
incorporating the additional gauge fields at the singularities. We derive the
Kahler potential, gauge-kinetic function and superpotential for the resulting
N=1 four-dimensional theory. Blowing-up of the orbifold is described by a Higgs
effect and the results are consistent with the corresponding ones obtained for
smooth G2 spaces. Further, we consider flux and Wilson lines on singular loci
of the G2 space, and discuss the relation to N=4 SYM theory.
  In the second half, we develop an algorithmic framework for E8 x E8 heterotic
compactifications with monad bundles. We begin by considering cyclic Calabi-Yau
manifolds where we classify positive monad bundles, prove stability, and
compute the complete particle spectrum for all bundles. Next, we generalize the
construction to bundles on complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show
that the class of positive monad bundles, subject to the heterotic anomaly
condition, is finite (~7000 models). We compute the particle spectrum for these
models and develop new techniques for computing the cohomology of line bundles.
There are no anti-generations of particles and the spectrum is manifestly
moduli-dependent. We further study the slope-stability of positive monad
bundles and develop a new method for proving stability of SU(n) vector bundles.

between the conventional and torque spin-Hall conductivities for the generic
effective Hamiltonian $H_0=\epsilon_k^0+A(k)\sigma_x-B(k)\sigma_y$, where
$A(k)=\eta^A_ik_i+\eta^A_{ij}k_ik_j+\eta^A_{ijl}k_ik_jk_l+...$,
$B(k)=\eta^B_ik_i+\eta^B_{ij}k_ik_j+\eta^B_{ijl}k_ik_jk_l+...$, and $\eta$'s
are the specific system-dependent coefficients. Specifically, we find that in
the intrinsic case the magnitude of torque spin-Hall conductivity
$\sigma^{\tau_z}_{xy}(0)$ is always twice larger than the conventional
spin-Hall conductivity $\sigma^{s_z}_{xy}(0)$, and the two conductivities have
the opposite signs, i.e., $\sigma^{\tau_z}_{xy}(0)=-2\sigma^{s_z}_{xy}(0)$.
This universal relation also holds in the presence of an uniform in-plane
magnetic field. We also find that if the energy dispersion is rotationally
invariant, there exists a hyper-angular momentum $I_z = (k\times
\partial\theta/\partial k)_z s_z + L_z$ which is conserved. Furthermore, the
hyper-angular momentum current $<{1/2}\{I_z,v_x\}>$ vanishes, and this leads to
a hyper selection rule for the conventional spin-Hall current.

photon knocks-out an energetic quark which rescatters subsequently with a quark
of the other nucleon. The latter provides a mechanism of sharing the initial
high momentum of the photon between two outgoing nucleons. This final state
hard rescattering can be expressed through the hard NN scattering amplitude.

conditioned to return to the origin at time $t=1$ and to stay positive during
time interval $0 < t < 1$, is called the Bessel bridge with duration 1. We
consider the $N$-particle system of such Bessel bridges conditioned never to
collide with each other in $0 < t < 1$, which is the continuum limit of the
vicious walk model in watermelon configuration with a wall. Distributions of
maximum-values of paths attained in the time interval $t \in (0,1)$ are studied
to characterize the statistics of random patterns of the repulsive paths on the
spatio-temporal plane. For the outermost path, the distribution function of
maximum value is exactly determined for general $N$. We show that the present
$N$-path system of noncolliding Bessel bridges is realized as the
positive-eigenvalue process of the $2N \times 2N$ matrix-valued Brownian bridge
in the symmetry class C. Using this fact computer simulations are performed and
numerical results on the $N$-dependence of the maximum-value distributions of
the inner paths are reported. The present work demonstrates that the
extreme-value problems of noncolliding paths are related with the random matrix
theory, representation theory of symmetry, and the number theory.

We have grown epitaxial thin films with 0<=x<=0.9 on MgO(001) substrates with
excellent structural properties both in pure Ar atmosphere and an Ar/O2 mixture

the saturation magnetization can be tuned over a wide range during growth. Our
extensive characterization of the films provides a clear picture of the
underlying physics of this spinel ferrimagnet with antiparallel Fe moments on
the A and B sublattice: (i) Zn substitution removes both Fe3+ moments from the
A sublattice and itinerant charge carriers from the B sublattice, (ii) growth
in finite oxygen partial pressure generates Fe vacancies on the B sublattice
also removing itinerant charge carriers, and (iii) application of both Zn
substitution and excess oxygen results in a compensation effect as Zn
substitution partially removes the Fe vacancies. A decrease (increase) of
charge carrier density results in a weakening (strengthening) of double
exchange and thereby a decrease (increase) of conductivity and the saturation
magnetization. This scenario is confirmed by the observation that the
saturation magnetization scales with the longitudinal conductivity. The
combination of tailored films with semiconductor materials such as ZnO in
multi-functional heterostructures seems to be particularly appealing.

integrate the resulting probability density function (pdf) over the EFT
parameters that are not of specific interest in the fit. We also explore
marginalization over the order of the EFT calculation, M, and over the

EFT parameters of interest given a data set, D. We use this formula and the
simpler ""augmented chi-squared"" in a toy problem for which we generate
pseudo-data. These Bayesian methods, when used in combination with the
""naturalness prior"", facilitate reliable extractions of EFT parameters in cases
where chi-squared methods are ambiguous at best. We also examine the problem of
extracting the nucleon mass in the chiral limit, M_0, and the nucleon sigma
term, from pseudo-data on the nucleon mass as a function of the pion mass. We
find that Bayesian techniques can provide reliable information on M_0, even if
some of the data points used for the extraction lie outside the region of

\theta^{2\alpha-1}. Under these conditions it is known from earlier that the

We study the stationary states of the system as well as the dynamics after a

by distinct values of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and of the

the leads at a given V; and (3) the critical voltage at which superconductivity
in the island ceases. With regards to dynamics, we find numerical evidence that
the stationary states are stable and that no complicated non-stationary regime
can be induced by changing the voltage. This result is somewhat unexpected and
by no means trivial, given the fact that the system is driven out of
equilibrium. The response to a change in the voltage is always gradual, even in
the regime where changing the interaction strength induces rapid anharmonic

range from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. They lie well off the color
selection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within the
stellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects with
traditional color selection techniques. The reddenings found are much more
consistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemming
from the dust torus. We find an unusually high fraction of Broad Absorption
Line (BAL) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the Low
Ionization BAL (LoBAL) class and many also showing absorption the metastable
FeII line (FeLoBAL). The discovery of further examples of dust-reddened LoBAL
quasars provides more support for the hypothesis that BAL quasars (at least
LoBAL quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. The fact
that we see such a high fraction of BALs could indicate that the quasar is in a
young phase in which quasar feedback from the BAL winds is suppressing star
formation in the host galaxy.

described by a master equation the mean-field limit is derived resulting in an
effective non-hermitian (discrete) Gross-Pitaevskii equation which has been
introduced only phenomenologically up to now. The familiar mean-field phase
space structure is substantially altered by the dissipation. Especially the
character of the fixed points shows an abrupt transition from elliptic or
hyperbolic to attractiv or repulsive, respectively. This reflects the
metastable behaviour of the corresponding many-body system which surprisingly
also leads to a significant increase of the purity of the condensate. A
comparison of the mean-field approximation to simulations of the full master
equation using the Monte Carlo wave function method shows an excellent
agreement for wide parameter ranges.

formation history of this stacked population using a set of exponentially
declining functions. The strength of the Hydrogen Balmer absorption line series
in the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150\AA is used to constrain the SSFR
by comparing with a library of models generated using the BC03 stellar
population code. Our method, based on a principal component analysis (PCA), can
be applied in a consistent way to spectra drawn from local galaxy surveys and
from surveys at $z \sim 1$, and is only weakly influenced by attenuation due to
dust. We apply our method to galaxy samples drawn from SDSS and DEEP2 to study
mass-dependent growth of galaxies from $z \sim 1$ to $z \sim 0$. We find that,
(1) high mass galaxies have lower SSFRs than low mass galaxies; (2) the average
SSFR has decreased from $z=1$ to $z=0$ by a factor of $\sim 3-4$, independent
of galaxy mass. Additionally, at $z \sim 1$ our average SSFRs are a factor of
$2-2.5$ lower than those derived from multi-wavelength photometry using similar
datasets. We then compute the average time (in units of the Hubble time,
$t_{\rm H}(z)$) needed by galaxies of a given mass to form their stars at their
current rate. At both $z=0$ and at $z=1$, this timescale decreases strongly
with stellar mass from values close to unity for galaxies with masses $\sim
10^{10} M_{\odot}$, to more than ten for galaxies more massive than $ 10^{11}

users (SUs) in a secondary communication network (SCN) to opportunistically
operate in the frequency bands originally allocated to a primary communication
network (PCN) or by allowing SCN to coexist with the primary users (PUs) in PCN
as long as the interference caused by SCN to each PU is properly regulated. In
this paper, we consider the latter case, known as spectrum sharing, and study
the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity and the
outage capacity of the SU fading channel under different types of power
constraints and fading channel models. In particular, besides the interference
power constraint at PU, the transmit power constraint of SU is also considered.
Since the transmit power and the interference power can be limited either by a
peak or an average constraint, various combinations of power constraints are
studied. It is shown that there is a capacity gain for SU under the average
over the peak transmit/interference power constraint. It is also shown that
fading for the channel between SU transmitter and PU receiver is usually a
beneficial factor for enhancing the SU channel capacities.

One potential explanation for this, the one considered here, is that the wave
function collapses down to just one version. The experimental situation is
briefly reviewed, with no evidence found for collapse. The theoretical position
is also reviewed and found wanting. Collapse-by-observation schemes are
logically untenable. A mathematical theory of collapse must be nonlinear, a
significant departure from current quantum theory. In addition, the primary
candidate theory, the GRW-Pearle model, requires instantaneous, non-local
transmission of information. It also requires transmission of information
across versions of reality, which is forbidden in current quantum mechanics.
And there is no apparent physical quantity, such as particle number, that can
provide the mechanism for collapse in all cases. Further, these aspects, which
are in disagreement with current theory, seem to be necessary for any
mathematical theory of collapse. The conclusion is that the outlook for
mathematical collapse schemes is not encouraging.

surprising rise in the positron to electron ratio at high energies. It has also
recently been found that electromagnetic radiative corrections in some cases
may boost the gamma-ray yield from supersymmetric dark matter annihilations in
the galactic halo by up to three or four orders of magnitude, providing
distinct spectral signatures for indirect dark matter searches to look for.
Here, we investigate whether the same type of corrections can also lead to
sizeable enhancements in the positron yield. We find that this is indeed the
case, albeit for a smaller region of parameter space than for gamma rays;
selecting models with a small mass difference between the neutralino and
sleptons, like in the stau coannihilation region in mSUGRA, the effect becomes
more pronounced. The resulting, rather hard positron spectrum with a relatively
sharp cutoff may potentially fit the rising positron ratio measured by the
PAMELA satellite. To do so, however, very large ""boost factors"" have to be
invoked that are not expected in current models of halo structure. If the
predicted cutoff would also be confirmed by later PAMELA data or upcoming
experiments, one could either assume non-thermal production in the early
universe or non-standard halo formation to explain such a spectral feature as
an effect of dark matter annihilation. At the end of the paper, we briefly
comment on the impact of radiative corrections on other annihilation channels,
in particular antiprotons and neutrinos.

user-user similarities are obtained by a diffusion process. Furthermore, by
considering the second order similarities, we design an effective algorithm
that depresses the influence of mainstream preferences. The corresponding
algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, is further improved by
24.9% in the optimal case. In addition, two significant criteria of algorithmic
performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken into account. Numerical
results show that the algorithm based on second order similarity can outperform
the MCF simultaneously in all three criteria.

energy. The dissipation is accompanied by thermal fluctuations, which transfer
energy from the vibrational modes to rotation. Together, these processes are
known as internal relaxation. For the past several years, internal relaxation
has been thought to give rise to thermal flipping, with profound consequences
for grain alignment theory. I show that thermal flipping is not possible in the
limit that the inertia tensor does not vary with time.

partly lost or unavailable. In these cases it is required to convert
irregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing
data. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete
sampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number
of non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions
for the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then
analyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of
image super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections.
