polarization state onto a single collective-spin excitation (magnon) shared
between two spatially overlapped atomic ensembles. The polarization fidelity is
measured by quantum state tomography to be above 90(2)% for any input

constitutes a quantum non-destructive probe that detects and regenerates a

critical point has been found at a critical pressure of p_c = 2.5 GPa. The
field induced magnetic state in the superconducting state is stable up to the
highest field. At p_c the antiferromagnetic ground-state under high magnetic
field collapses very rapidly. Clear signatures of p_c are the strong
enhancement of the resistivity in the normal state and of the inelastic
scattering term. No clear T2 temperature dependence could be found for
pressures above T_c. From the analysis of the upper critical field within a
strong coupling model we present the pressure dependence of the coupling
parameter lambda and the gyromagnetic ratio g. No signatures of a spatially
modulated order parameter could be evidenced. A detailed comparison with the
magnetic field--temperature phase diagram of CeCoIn_5 is given. The comparison
between CeRhIn_5 and CeCoIn_5 points out the importance to take into account
the field dependence of the effective mass in the calculation of the
superconducting upper critical field H_c2. It suggests also that when the
magnetic critical field H_(0) becomes lower than H_c2 (0)$, the persistence of
a superconducting pseudo-gap may stick the antiferromagnetism to H_c2 (0).

focusing on empirical studies that yield useful properties of road networks

assumption that road networks are planar graphs. Indeed, based on the a number
of experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States
and District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road
networks are quite non-planar. Our approach therefore instead is directed at
finding algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as non-planar
geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of road networks that can
still lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and
Voronoi diagrams. In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed
graphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems.
This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without
making any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights. In
fact, our algorithms can allow for non-metric weights.

physically isolated, the self-similar approach accounts for the balance of the
number of gas molecules in the solution and in the bubble that expells
incompressible liquid solvent while growing. The rate of growth of the bubble
radius in its dependence from gas solubility and solution supersaturation is
obtained. There is a nonsteady effect of rapid increase of the rate of bubble

transform approach, we prove that an integral equation equivalent to (*) has a
unique solution ${\hat U} (k, q)$, exponentially bounded for $q$ in a sector
centered on $\RR^+$, where $q$ is the inverse Laplace dual to $1/t^n$ for $n

(*) for $t \in (0, T)$, where $T$ depends on $\| {\hat v}_0 \|_{l^{1}}$ and $\|
{\hat f} \|_{l^1}$. Global existence of the solution to NS follows if $\| {\hat

then the converse is also true: if NS has global solution, then there exists $n

exponential growth rate bound of U, \alpha, can be better estimated based on
the values of ${\hat U}$ on a finite interval $[0,q_0]$. We also show how the

the scale of the object size and results in sharp edges connecting interior

which Lambda, G and hbar all may be separately neglected, but there may arise
terms in the ratio of particle energies to the Planck mass which are small but
measurable. Such cases include probes of an energy dependent speed of light

such cases the leading order effect of quantum gravity will, if certain scaling
relations are satisfied, be to deform the metric in the effective Hamiltonian

introduce an apparent evolution in the observed gas mass fractions of X-ray
luminous, dynamically relaxed clusters and hence biases in observational
constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, derived from the
cluster distance-redshift relation. The Hubble parameter derived from the
combination of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) measurements is
affected by the He sedimentation process as well. Future measurements aiming to

gas accretion during their QSO/AGN phases. In this paper we apply an extended
Soltan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time-integral
of the QSO luminosity function, to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent
optical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust constraints on the luminosity
evolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that
the luminosity evolution probably involves two phases: an initial exponentially
increasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the
luminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of -1.2--1.3) set by
a self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution
involving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an
exponentially declining pattern in the second phase is likely. The period of a
QSO radiating at a luminosity higher than 10% of its peak value is about
(2-3)x10^8 yr, during which the MBH obtains ~80% of its mass. The
mass-to-energy conversion efficiency is $0.16\pm0.04 ^{+0.05}_{-0}$, with the
latter error accounting for the maximum uncertainty due to Compton-thick AGNs.
The expected Eddington ratios in QSOs from the constrained luminosity evolution
cluster around a single value close to 0.5-1 for high-luminosity QSOs and
extend to a wide range of lower values for low-luminosity ones. The Eddington
ratios for high luminosity QSOs appear to conflict with those estimated from
observations (~0.25) by using some virial mass estimators for MBHs in QSOs

2-4. We also infer the fraction of optically obscured QSOs ~60-80%. Further

shocks, which are responsible for particle (electron, positron, and ion)
acceleration. The simulation results show that the Weibel instability is
responsible for generating and amplifying highly nonuniform, small-scale
magnetic fields. These magnetic fields contribute to the electron's transverse
deflection behind the jet head. The ``jitter'' radiation from deflected
electrons in small-scale magnetic fields has different properties than
synchrotron radiation which is calculated in a uniform magnetic field. This
jitter radiation, a case of diffusive synchrotron radiation, may be important
to understand the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma-ray
bursts, relativistic jets, and supernova remnants.

The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the detector response due
to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength
approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004
Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer
such errors can be as large as 10 percent. For more accurate analysis, these
authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long wavelength
approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the
linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and
therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula,
commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend
the calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the
interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines
the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to
the Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In
particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at
most 2-3 percent for those locations in the sky where the detector response is
greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on
detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic
gravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic
stochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the
effect of such errors is at most 1-2 percent. For higher frequencies, or if
more accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the response.

determined by applying the spectrum-fitting method to the high-dispersion
spectral data obtained with BOES at BOAO. We found that the peculiarities
(underabundances of C, O, and Ca; an overabundance of Ba) seen in slow rotators
efficiently decrease with an increase of rotation, which almost disappear at
v_e sin i > 100 km s^-1. This further suggests that stars with sufficiently
large rotational velocity may retain the original composition at the surface
without being altered. Considering the subsolar tendency (by several tenths dex
below) exhibited by the elemental abundances of such rapidly-rotating

decreased since our Sun was born, contrary to the common picture of galactic

  Reipurth, ed",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NGC 2362 is a richly populated Galactic cluster, devoid of natal molecular
gas and dust. The cluster represents the final product of the star forming
process and hosts an unobscured and near-complete initial mass function. NGC
2362 is dominated by the O9 Ib multiple star, tau CMa, as well as several dozen
unevolved B-type stars. Distributed throughout the cluster are several hundred
suspected intermediate and low-mass pre-main sequence members. Various
post-main sequence evolutionary models have been used to infer an age of 5 Myr
for the one evolved member, tau CMa. These estimates are in close agreement
with the ages derived by fitting pre-main sequence isochrones to the
contracting, low-mass stellar population of the cluster. The extremely narrow
sequence of stars, which extends more than 9 mag in the optical color-magnitude
diagram, suggests that star formation within the cluster occurred rapidly and
coevally across the full mass spectrum. Ground-based near infrared and H-alpha
emission surveys of NGC 2362 concluded that most (~90%) of the low-mass members
have already dissipated their optically-thick, inner(< 1 AU) circumstellar
disks. Spitzer IRAC observations of the cluster have confirmed these results,
placing an upper limit on the primordial, optically thick disk fraction of the
cluster at 7(+/-)2%. The presence of circumstellar disks among candidate
members of NGC 2362 is also strongly mass-dependent, such that no stars more
massive than 1.2 Msun exhibit significant infrared excess shortward of 8
microns. The well-defined upper main sequence of NGC 2362, its large population
of low-mass stars, and the narrow age spread evident in the color-magnitude

evolution.

achieved by localizing an electron at each copper atom in real space (r-space).
Removing a small fraction of these electrons (hole doping) transforms this
system into a superconducting fluid of delocalized Cooper pairs in momentum
space (k-space). During this transformation, two distinctive classes of
electronic excitations appear. At high energies, the enigmatic 'pseudogap'
excitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, Bogoliubov quasi-particles
-- the excitations resulting from the breaking of Cooper pairs -- should exist.
To explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, we
have imaged the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d in r-space and k-space
simultaneously. We find that although the low energy excitations are indeed
Bogoliubov quasi-particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k-space
that shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. Concomitantly, spectral
weight is transferred to higher energy r-space states that lack the
characteristics of excitations from delocalized Cooper pairs. Instead, these
states break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomic
scale in an energy independent fashion. We demonstrate that these unusual
r-space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. Thus, as the Mott
insulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalized
Cooper pairs vanish from k-space, to be replaced by locally translational- and
rotational-symmetry-breaking pseudogap states in r-space.

present a new data analysis method for long slit spectroscopy (LSS) with
coronagraphy, which allows characterization of planetary companions of low
effective temperature. In a speckle-limited regime, this method allows an
accurate estimation and subtraction of the scattered starlight, to extract a
clean spectrum of the planetary companion. We performed intensive LSS
simulations with IDL/CAOS to obtain realistic spectra of low (R=35) and medium
(R=400) resolution in the J, H, and K bands. The simulated spectra were used to
test our method and estimate its performance in terms of contrast reduction and
extracted spectra quality. Our simulations are based on a software package
dedicated to the development of SPHERE, a second generation instrument for the
ESO-VLT. Our method allows a contrast reduction of 0.5 to 2.0 magnitudes

that errors in the wavelength calibration can produce significant errors in the

line-of-sight velocities from the literature, and 3D velocities for additional
young stars in the central parsec, we constrain the true orbit of each

in two stellar disks as has been previously proposed. Analysis of the stellar
orbits reveals only one of the previously proposed disks of young stars using a
method that is capable of detecting disks containing at least 7 stars. The
detected disk contains 50% of the young stars, is inclined by ~115 deg from the

several candidate disk members have eccentricities greater than 0.2. Our
findings suggest that the young stars may have formed in situ but in a more

spread across several parsecs. Associated with the cluster is an extensive
molecular cloud complex spanning more than two degrees on the sky. Star
formation is ongoing within the region as evidenced by the presence of numerous
embedded clusters of protostars, molecular outflows, and Herbig-Haro objects.
The stellar population of NGC 2264 is dominated by the O7 V multiple star, S
Mon, and several dozen B-type zero-age main sequence stars. X-ray imaging
surveys, H-alpha emission surveys, and photometric variability studies have
identified more than 600 intermediate and low-mass members distributed
throughout the molecular cloud complex, but concentrated within two densely
populated areas between S Mon and the Cone Nebula. Estimates for the total
stellar population of the cluster range as high as 1000 members and limited
deep photometric surveys have identified 230 substellar mass candidates. The
median age of NGC 2264 is estimated to be 3 Myr, but an apparent age dispersion
of at least 5 Myr can be inferred from the broadened sequence of suspected
members. Infrared and millimeter observations of the cluster have identified
two prominent sites of star formation activity centered near NGC 2264 IRS1, a
deeply embedded early-type star, and IRS2, a star forming core and associated
protostellar cluster. Given its relative proximity, well-defined stellar
population, and low foreground extinction, the cluster will remain a prime
candidate for star formation studies throughout the foreseeable future.

a control parameter is varied. However, since deriving the algebraic system
containing the Fourier coefficients can be a highly cumbersome procedure, the
classical HBM is often limited to polynomial (quadratic and cubic)
nonlinearities and/or a few harmonics. Several variations on the classical HBM,
such as the incremental HBM or the alternating frequency/time domain HBM, have
been presented in the literature to overcome this shortcoming. Here, we present
an alternative approach that can be applied to a very large class of dynamical
systems (autonomous or forced) with smooth equations. The main idea is to
systematically recast the dynamical system in quadratic polynomial form before
applying the HBM. Once the equations have been rendered quadratic, it becomes
obvious to derive the algebraic system and solve it by the so-called ANM
continuation technique. Several classical examples are presented to illustrate
the use of this numerical approach.

minor species (e.g., HCN); ii) to investigate the chemical composition of

temperature and expansion velocity. Continuum observations probe large-size
dust particles and (for the largest objects) cometary nuclei. Comets are
classified from their orbital characteristics into two separate classes: i)
nearly-isotropic, mainly long-period comets and ii) ecliptic, short-period
comets, the so-called Jupiter-family comets. These two classes apparently come
from two different reservoirs, respectively the Oort cloud and the
trans-Neptunian scattered disc. Due to their different history and - possibly -
their different origin, they may have different chemical and physical
properties that are worth being investigated. The present article reviews the
contribution of radio observations to our knowledge of the Jupiter-family
comets (JFCs). The difficulty of such a study is the commonly low gas and dust
productions of these comets. Long-period, nearly-isotropic comets from the Oort
cloud are better known from Earth-based observations. On the other hand,
Jupiter-family comets are more easily accessed by space missions. However,
unique opportunities to observe Jupiter-family comets are offered when these
objects come by chance close to the Earth. About a dozen JFCs were successfully
observed by radio techniques up to now. No obvious evidence for different
properties between JFCs and other families of comets is found.

known, the capture rate can be estimated; the question then arises of whether
the apparent quiescence of the nuclei of these GCs is compatible with the
IMBH's presence. The role of debris from disrupted stars in activating
quiescent nuclei of GCs is studied here employing three-dimensional
hydrodynamics simulations. It is argued that when individual stars are
disrupted, the bulk of the debris would be swallowed or expelled rapidly

fraction of the tightly bound mass is likely to be swallowed, yielding
radiation with high efficiency, the surplus being expelled in a
radiation-driven wind. A transient (predominantly of soft X-ray emission)
signal could persist steadily with L ~ L_Edd =10^{41}(M_h/10^3M_sun) erg/s for
at most tens of years; thereafter the flare would rapidly fade. While the
infall rate declines as t^{-5/3}, some material may be stored for a longer time
in an accretion disk. The IMBH luminosity could then remain as high as L_X >
10^{39} erg/s for several hundreds of years after disruption. In a given
object, this ultraluminous X-ray activity would have a duty cycle of order
10^{-4}. Quiescent GCs, those with IMBHs now starved of fuel, should greatly
outnumber active ones; observational constraints would not then be stringent
until we had observed enough candidates to constitute a proper ensemble
average.(abridged)

  in time-dependent density functional theory",,,,,"cond-mat.other cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (TDDFT) promises a numerically
tractable account of many-body electron dynamics provided good simple
approximations are developed for the exchange-correlation (XC) potential
functional (XCPF). The theory is usually applied within the adiabatic XCPF
approximation, appropriate for slowly varying TD driving fields. As the
frequency and strength of these fields grows, it is widely held that memory
effects kick in and the eligibility of the adiabatic XCPF approximation
deteriorates irreversibly. We point out however that when a finite system of
electrons in its ground-state is gradually exposed to a very a high-frequency
and eventually ultra-strong homogeneous electric field, the adiabatic XCPF
approximation is in fact rigorously applicable. This result not only helps to
explain recent numerical results for a 1D-helium atom subject to a strong
linearly-polarized laser pulse (Thiel et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 153004,
(2008)) but also shows that it is applicable to any number of electrons and in
full 3D.

action of an automorphism of order 7. 63 lines of the hexagon carry three
points each and represent the triples of operators such that the product of any

embedding in a projective 5-space over GF(2), the 35 symmetric operators are
also found to answer to the points of a Klein quadric in such space. The 28
antisymmetric matrices can be associated with the 28 vertices of the Coxeter

subgroup of the automorphism group of the hexagon is discussed in detail and
the Coxeter sub-geometry is found to be intricately related to the
E_7-symmetric black-hole entropy formula in string theory. It is also
conjectured that the full geometry/symmetry of the hexagon should manifest
itself in the corresponding black-hole solutions. Finally, an intriguing
analogy with the case of Hopf sphere fibrations and a link with coding theory

This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power

we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current
propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the

scale (evaluated in serial) is available in the form of the usual reaction rate
equations. A stochastic simulation algorithm is used to obtain an exact
realization of the process at the mesoscopic scale (in parallel).
  The underlying stochastic description is a jump process driven by the Poisson
measure. A convergence result in this arguably difficult setting is established
suggesting that a homogenization of the solution is advantageous. We devise a
simple but highly general such technique.
  Three numerical experiments on models representative to the field of
computational systems biology illustrate the method. For non-stiff problems, it
is shown that the method is able to quickly converge even when stochastic
effects are present. For stiff problems we are instead able to obtain fast
convergence to a homogenized solution.
  Overall, the method builds an attractive bridge between on the one hand,
macroscopic deterministic scales and, on the other hand, mesoscopic stochastic
ones. This construction is clearly possible to apply also to stochastic models
within other fields.

formation of a magnetic order requires a larger amount of Ni than that of Zn,
which is similar to our previous results of x=0.13. From the estimation of
volume fractions of superconducting (SC) and magnetic regions, it has been
found for x=0.15 that the SC region is in rough correspondence to the region
where Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the muSR frequency window for both Zn- and
Ni-substituted samples. According to the stripe model, it follows that, even
for x=0.15, the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes are pinned and
localized around Zn and Ni, leading to the formation of the static stripe order
and the suppression of superconductivity. These may indicate an importance of
the dynamical stripe in the appearance of the high-T_c_ superconductivity in
the hole-doped cuprates. In the overdoped regime of x=0.18 and 0.20, on the
other hand, the SC region seems to be in rough correspondence to the region
where Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the muSR frequency window, though it
appears that the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity are affected by the
phase separation into SC and normal-state regions.

explicit aqueous electrolyte solutions (NaCl, KCl, NaI, and KF) at large salt
concentrations (3-4 M) is investigated using 1 microsecond molecular dynamics
(MD) computer simulations. The peptide displays 71 alpha-helical structure
without salt and destabilizes with the addition of NaCl in agreement with
experiments of a somewhat longer version. It is mainly stabilized by direct and
indirect (i+4)EK salt bridges between the Lys and Glu side chains and a
concomitant backbone shielding mechanism. NaI is found to be a stronger
denaturant than NaCl, while the potassium salts hardly show influence.
Investigation of the molecular structures reveals that consistent with recent
experiments Na+ has a much stronger affinity to side chain carboxylates and
backbone carbonyls than K+, thereby weakening salt bridges and secondary
structure hydrogen bonds. At the same time the large I- has a considerable
affinity to the nonpolar alanine in line with recent observations of a large
propensity of I- to adsorb to simple hydrophobes, and thereby 'assists' Na+ in
its destabilizing action. In the denatured states of the peptide novel
long-lived (10-20 ns) 'loop'-configurations are observed in which single Na+
ions and water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to multiple backbone carbonyls. In
an attempt to analyze the denaturation behavior within the preferential
interaction formalism, we find indeed that for the strongest denaturant, NaI,
the protein is least hydrated. Additionally, a possible indication for protein
denaturation might be a preferential solvation of the first solvation shell of
the peptide backbone by the destabilizing cosolute (sodium).

it is unclear what generates them. One theory is that warps are generated
internally through spontaneous bending instabilities. Other theories suggest
that they result from the interaction of the outer disk with accreting
extragalactic material. In this case, we expect to find cases where the
circular velocity of the warp gas is poorly correlated with the rotational
velocity of the galaxy disk at the same radius. Optical spectroscopy presents
itself as an interesting alternative to 21-cm observations for testing this
prediction, because (i) separating the kinematics of the warp from those of the
disk requires a spatial resolution that is higher than what is achieved at 21
cm at low HI column density; (ii) optical spectroscopy also provides important
information on star formation rates, gas excitation, and chemical abundances,
which provide clues to the origin of the gas in warps. We present here
preliminary results of a study of the kinematics of gas in the outer-disk warps

atomic hydrogen. A single HI tail was found to the South of the Medusa with a
projected length of 56 kpc (5') and a gas mass of 7* 10^8 M_sun, thus
harbouring about one third of the total HI mass of the system. HI was also
detected in absorption toward the continuum in the center. HI was detected in a
small nearby galaxy to the North-West of the Medusa at a projected distance of
91 kpc. It is, however, unlikely that this galaxy has had a significant
influence on the evolution of the Medusa. The simulations of the slightly
prograde infall of a gas-rich disk galaxy on an larger, four time more massive

turbulent regions, dead zones and gravitationally unstable regions. Although
the dead zones are stable, there is some transport due to the Reynolds stress
associated with waves emitted from the turbulent layers. We model the transport
in each of the different regions by its own $\alpha$ parameter, this being 10
to $10^{3}$ times smaller in dead zones than in active layers. In
gravitationally unstable regions, $\alpha$ is determined by the fact that the
disk self-adjusts to a state of marginal stability. We construct steady-state
models of such disks. We find that for uniform mass flow, the disk has to be
more massive, hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone. In
disks in which the dead zone is very massive, gravitational instabilities are
present. Whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether
hydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all
the way inside the dead zone. This may be more easily achieved when the ratio
of the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large,
which in our models corresponds to $\alpha$ in the dead zone being about 10% of
$\alpha$ in the active layers. If the disk is at some stage of its evolution
not in steady-state, then the surface density will evolve toward the
steady-state solution. However, if $\alpha$ in the dead zone is much smaller
than in the active zone, the timescale for the parts of the disk beyond a few
AU to reach steady-state may become longer than the disk lifetime. Steady-state
disks with dead zones are a more favorable environment for planet formation
than standard disks, since the dead zone is typically 10 times more massive

matter halos, but these have not yet led to a physical understanding that is
generally accepted. This is especially true for the central regions of these
structures. Recently two major themes have emerged. In one, the dark matter
halo is primarily a result of the sequential accretion of primordial structure
(ie `Nature'); while in the other, dynamical relaxation (ie `Nurture')
dominates at least in the central regions. Some relaxation is however required
in either mechanism. In this paper we accept the recently established
scale-free sub-structure of halos as an essential part of both mechanisms.
Consequently; a simple model for the central relaxation based on a self-similar
cascade of tidal interactions, is contrasted with a model based on the
accretion of adiabatically self-similar, primordial structure. We conclude that
a weak form of this relaxation is present in the simulations, but that is
normally described as the radial orbit instability.

the analysis of DM phase-space distribution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies

derive such a bound. The first one depends on the information about the current
phase space distribution of DM particles only, while the second one uses both
the initial and final distributions. We discuss the recent data on dSphs as
well as astronomical uncertainties in relevant parameters. As an application,
we present lower bounds on the mass of DM particles, coming from various dSphs,
using both methods. The model-independent bound holds for any type of fermionic
DM. Stronger, model-dependent bounds are quoted for several DM models (thermal
relics, non-resonantly and resonantly produced sterile neutrinos, etc.). The
latter bounds rely on the assumption that baryonic feedback cannot
significantly increase the maximum of a distribution function of DM particles.
For the scenario in which all the DM is made of sterile neutrinos produced via
non-resonant mixing with the active neutrinos (NRP) this gives m_nrp > 1.7 keV.
Combining these results in their most conservative form with the X-ray bounds
of DM decay lines, we conclude that the NRP scenario remains allowed in a very
narrow parameter window only. This conclusion is independent of the results of
the Lyman-alpha analysis. The DM model in which sterile neutrinos are
resonantly produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry remains viable. Within
the minimal neutrino extension of the Standard Model (the nuMSM), both mass and
the mixing angle of the DM sterile neutrino are bounded from above and below,
which suggests the possibility for its experimental search.

galaxies, CAULDRON, to a rotating N-body stellar system with dark matter halo
which significantly violates the two major assumptions of the method, i.e.
axial symmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function. The goal is
to study how CAULDRON performs in an extreme case, and to determine which
galaxy properties can still be robustly recovered. Three data sets,
corresponding to orthogonal lines of sight, are generated from the N-body
system and analysed with the identical procedure followed in the study of real
lens galaxies, adopting an axisymmetric power-law total density distribution.
We find that several global properties of the N-body system are recovered with
remarkable accuracy, despite the fact that the adopted power-law model is too
simple to account for the lack of symmetry of the true density distribution. In
particular, the logarithmic slope of the total density distribution is robustly
recovered to within less than 10 per cent (with the exception of the
ill-constrained very inner regions), the inferred angle-averaged radial profile
of the total mass closely follows the true distribution, and the dark matter
fraction of the system (inside the effective radius) is correctly determined
within ~ 10 per cent of the total mass. Unless the line of sight direction is
almost parallel to the total angular momentum vector of the system, reliably
recovered quantities also include the angular momentum, the V/sigma ratio, and
the anisotropy parameter delta. We conclude that the CAULDRON code can be
safely and effectively applied to real early-type lens galaxies, providing
reliable information also for systems that depart significantly from the
method's assumptions.

history. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow and fast
solar-type rotators from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the age of the Sun and
compare them to the distribution of rotational periods observed for solar-type
stars between 1 Myr and 5 Gyr. We show that slow rotators develop a high degree
of differential rotation between the radiative core and the convective
envelope, while fast rotators evolve with little core-envelope decoupling. We
suggest that strong differential rotation at the base of the convective
envelope is responsible for enhanced lithium depletion in slow rotators. We
conclude that lithium-depleted exoplanet host stars were slow rotators on the
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and argue that slow rotation results from a long
lasting star-disk interaction during the PMS. Altogether, this suggests that
long-lived disks (> 5 Myr) may be a necessary condition for massive planet
formation/migration.

possibly make up much of the solar background emission. Determining their
frequency and energy input is central to understanding the heating of the solar
corona. One method is to extrapolate the energy frequency distribution of
larger individually observed flares to lower energies. Only if the power law
exponent is greater than 2, is it considered possible that nanoflares
contribute significantly to the energy input.
  Aims. Time sequences of ultraviolet line radiances observed in the corona of
an active region are modelled with the aim of determining the power law
exponent of the nanoflare energy distribution.
  Methods. A simple nanoflare model based on three key parameters (the flare
rate, the flare duration time, and the power law exponent of the flare energy
frequency distribution) is used to simulate emission line radiances from the
ions Fe XIX, Ca XIII, and Si iii, observed by SUMER in the corona of an active
region as it rotates around the east limb of the Sun. Light curve pattern
recognition by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) scheme is used to determine
the values.
  Results. The power law exponents, alpha 2.8, 2.8, and 2.6 for Fe XIX, Ca
XIII, and Si iii respectively.
  Conclusions. The light curve simulations imply a power law exponent greater
than the critical value of 2 for all ion species. This implies that if the
energy of flare-like events is extrapolated to low energies, nanoflares could
provide a significant contribution to the heating of active region coronae.

can be expanded in this way. Thus, success is not guaranteed. Simple sufficient
conditions based on the decay rates and sign patters of the

that $f (z$ is analytic at $z=0$. Meaningful result are obtained if the
$\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$ either decay exponentially or factorially as $n \to
\infty$. The situation is much more complicated if the $\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$
decay algebraically as $n \to \infty$. If the $\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$
ultimately have the same sign, the series expansions for the power series
coefficients diverge, and the corresponding function is not analytic at $z=0.
If the $\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$ ultimately have strictly alternating signs, the
series expansions for the power series coefficients are summable and the power
series represents an analytic function. In the case of simple
$\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$, the summation of the divergent series for the power
series coefficients can often be accomplished with the help of analytic
continuation formulas for hypergeometric series, but if the
$\lambda_{n}^{(\alpha)}$ are more complicated, numerical techniques have to be
employed. Certain nonlinear sequence transformations -- in particular the

diffusive scalar field in large-scale incompressible flows in the presence of a
(large-scale) source. By ``large-scale'' it is meant that the spectral support
of the flows is confined to the wave-number region $k<k_d$, where $k_d$ is
relatively small compared with the diffusion wave number $k_\kappa$. Such flows
mediate couplings between neighbouring wave numbers within $k_d$ of each other
only. It is found that the spectral rate of transport (flux) of scalar variance
across a high wave number $k>k_d$ is bounded from above by $Uk_dk\Theta(k,t)$,
where $U$ denotes the maximum fluid velocity and $\Theta(k,t)$ is the spectrum
of the scalar variance, defined as its average over the shell $(k-k_d,k+k_d)$.
For a given flux, say $\vartheta>0$, across $k>k_d$, this bound requires
$$\Theta(k,t)\ge \frac{\vartheta}{Uk_d}k^{-1}.$$ This is consistent with recent
numerical studies and with Batchelor's theory that predicts a $k^{-1}$ spectrum
(with a slightly different proportionality constant) for the viscous-convective
range, which could be identified with $(k_d,k_\kappa)$. Thus, Batchelor's
formula for the variance spectrum is recovered by the present method in the
form of a critical lower bound. The present result applies to a broad range of
large-scale advection problems in space dimensions $\ge2$, including some
filter models of turbulence, for which the turbulent velocity field is advected
by a smoothed version of itself. For this case, $\Theta(k,t)$ and $\vartheta$
are the kinetic energy spectrum and flux, respectively.

thoughts on the general applicability of the method are offered.

$kP$-modules. It is known that $D(P)$ is detected via deflation--restriction by
the family of all sections of $P$ which are elementary abelian of rank $\leq2$.
In this paper, we improve this result by characterizing $D(P)$ as the limit
(with respect to deflation--restriction maps and conjugation maps) of all
groups $D(T/S)$ where $T/S$ runs through all sections of $P$ which are either
elementary abelian of rank $\leq3$ or extraspecial of order $p^3$ and exponent

in which the inflaton is the position of a D4 brane on a ""twisted torus"".
Specifically, we study the repeated collisions between the D4 brane and a D6
brane (on which the Standard Model fields are assumed to be localized) at a
fixed position along the monodromy direction as the D4 brane rolls down its
potential. We find that there is no trapping of the rolling D4 brane until it
reaches the bottom of its potential, and that reheating is entirely described
by the last brane encounter. Previous collisions have negligible effect on the
brane velocity and hence on the reheat temperature. In the context of our
setup, reheating is efficient and the reheat temperature is therefore high.

access in IEEE 802.11. In face of its success, it is remarkable that there is
little consensus on the actual degree of fairness achieved, particularly
bearing its impact on quality of service in mind. In this paper we provide an
accurate model for the fairness of the DCF. Given M greedy stations we assume
fairness if a tagged station contributes a share of 1/M to the overall number
of packets transmitted. We derive the probability distribution of fairness
deviations and support our analytical results by an extensive set of
measurements. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement of long-term
over short-term fairness. Regarding the random countdown values we quantify the
significance of their distribution whereas we discover that fairness is largely
insensitive to the distribution parameters. Based on our findings we view the
DCF as emulating an ideal fair queuing system to quantify the deviations from a
fair rate allocation. We deduce a stochastic service curve model for the DCF to
predict packet delays in IEEE 802.11. We show how a station can estimate its
fair bandwidth share from passive measurements of its traffic arrivals and
departures.

obeying the axis condition which is Z_2^\phi invariant; for this system there
is an exact formula for the force between the two black holes, in terms of
their physical quantities and the coordinate distance. We then show that 1) the
angular velocity of the two black holes decreases from the usual Kerr value at
infinite distance to zero in the touching limit; 2) the extremal limit of the
two black holes is given by |J|=cM^2, where c depends on the distance and
varies from one to infinity as the distance decreases; 3) for sufficiently
large angular momentum the temperature of the black holes attains a maximum at
a certain finite coordinate distance. All of these results are interpreted in
terms of the dragging effects of the system.

Subsequent collisions of the excited H3+ ions with argon lead to the formation
of ArH+ ions that were detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer with high
sensitivity. We report the observation of 17 previously unobserved transitions
to states above the barrier to linearity. Comparison to theoretical
calculations suggests that the transition strengths of some of these lines are
more than five orders of magnitude smaller than those of the fundamental band,
which renders them - to the best of our knowledge - the weakest H3+ transitions
observed to date.
