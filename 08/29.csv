procedure for regulating its divergent spacetime volume. Recently, a new test
of such spacetime measures has emerged: normal observers - who evolve in pocket
universes cooling from hot big bang conditions - must not be vastly outnumbered
by ""Boltzmann brains"" - freak observers that pop in and out of existence as a
result of rare quantum fluctuations. If the Boltzmann brains prevail, then a
randomly chosen observer would be overwhelmingly likely to be surrounded by an
empty world, where all but vacuum energy has redshifted away, rather than the
rich structure that we observe. Using the scale-factor cutoff measure, we
calculate the ratio of Boltzmann brains to normal observers. We find the ratio
to be finite, and give an expression for it in terms of Boltzmann brain
nucleation rates and vacuum decay rates. We discuss the conditions that these
rates must obey for the ratio to be acceptable, and we discuss estimates of the
rates under a variety of assumptions.

for off-axis simulations and we have found that this plasma distribution
collapses into a Quad-Lobe charge-separated non-neutral magnetospheric plasma

correlated two-dimensional Mott insulators. The understanding of the connection
between the superconductor and the Mott insulator hits at the heart of the
high-temperature superconducting mechanism. In this paper we investigate the
zero-temperature doping-driven evolution of a superconductor towards the Mott
insulator in a two dimensional electron model, relevant for high temperature
superconductivity. To this purpose we use a cluster extension of dynamical mean
field theory. Our results show that a standard (BCS) d-wave superconductor,
realized at high doping, is driven into the Mott insulator via an intermediate
state displaying non-standard physical properties. By restoring the
translational invariance of the lattice, we give an interpretation of these
findings in momentum space. In particular, we show that at a finite doping a
strong momentum-space differentiation takes place: non-Fermi liquid and
insulating-like (pseudogap) character rises in some regions (anti-nodes), while
Fermi liquid quasiparticles survive in other regions (nodes) of momentum space.
We describe the consequence of these happenings on the spectral properties,
stressing in particular the behavior of the superconducting gap, which reveals
two distinct nodal and antinodal energy scales as a function of doping. We
propose a description of the evolution of the electronic structure while
approaching the Mott transition and compare our results with tunneling
experiments, photoemission and magnetotransport on cuprate materials.

zero. We show numerically that a power law with nontrivial exponent describes
the growth of the total number of periodic attractors as the damping is
decreased. We also establish that for small scales the dynamics is governed by
\emph{effective} dynamical invariants, whose measure depends not only on the

the high impedance thermometers, the cold multiplexing and the use of a
resonant cavity to optimize absorption of electromagnetic radiation. I follow

bridges. It qualitatively is also expected from attractive long-range two-body
forces between constituents of the boundary. A geometric subtraction scheme is
presented that avoids divergent contributions to the interaction energy and
classifies the Brownian bridges that contribute to the force. These are all of

electroweak models with custodial symmetry, where the gauge symmetry is broken
with a bulk Higgs condensate. The electroweak constraints are not as stringent

ultracold neutrons (UCN) in an environment of high neutron flux (about 3*10^12
n/cm^2/s) at still acceptable radiation heat release (about 4*10^-3 W/g). It
can be realized within the reactor thermal column situated close to the reactor
core. With its large diameter of 1 m, this channel allows to install a 15 cm
thick bismuth shielding, a graphite premoderator (300 dm^3 at 20 K), and a
superfluid helium converter (35 dm^3). At a temperature of 1.2 K it is possible
to remove the heat release power of about 20 W. Using the 4pi flux of cold
neutrons within the reactor column can bring more than a factor 100 of cold
neutron flux incident on the superfluid helium with respect to the present cold
neutron beam conditions at the ILL reactor. The storage lifetime for UCN in
superfluid He at 1.2 K is about 30 s, which is sufficient when feeding
experiments requiring a similar filling time. The calculated density of UCN
with energy between 50 neV and 250 neV in an experimental volume of 40 liters
is about 10^4 n/cm^3. Technical solutions for realization of the project are
discussed.

at very low temperature regime was investigated using a transition-rate-state
dependent model considering the shear thinning behavior which means, once
material being subjected to high shear rates, the viscosity diminishes with
increasing shear rate. The preliminary results show that there might be nearly
frictionless fields for rate of deformation due to the almost vanishing shear
stress in micropores at very low temperature regime subjected to some surface
conditions : The relatively larger roughness (compared to the macroscopic
domain) inside micropores and the slip. As the pore size decreases, the
surface-to-volume ratio increases and therefore, surface roughness will greatly
affect the deformation kinetics in micropores.
  By using the boundary perturbation method, we obtained a class of temperature
and activation energy dependent fields for the deformation kinetics at low
temperature regime with the presumed small wavy roughness distributed along the
walls of an cylindrical micropore. The critical deformation kinetics of the
glassy matter is dependent upon the temperature, activation energy, activation
volume, orientation dependent and is proportional to the (referenced) shear
rate, the slip length, the amplitude and the orientation of the wavy-roughness.

reasonable interpretation of these wiggles is that they indicate that the Sun's
fusion ""furnace"" is pulsating, perhaps for reasons similar to that of the
Cepheid variables, albeit under a very different regime of pressure and
temperature. If this speculation is correct, we are seeing the heartbeat of the
Sun-the C-14 calibration curve is the Sun's ""neutrino-cardiogram."" Elevated

observed correlation between nuclear decay rates and solar activity or
Earth-Sun distance.

subject of scientific scrutiny in recent years. Observations of a
host-parasitoid interaction in the shrub's foliage, in which victims are
significantly less motile than their exploiters, record stable spatial patterns
in a fairly homogeneous environment. Though such pattern formation has been
found in reaction-diffusion models, the correspondence of these models to
continuous-time predator-prey interactions does not reflect the reality of the
system being studied. Near the root of the lupine, another host-parasitoid
interaction is also of considerable interest. In some cases this interaction,
which promotes the health of the lupine, has been observed to be much more
persistent than suggested by mathematical models.
  In this work a discrete-time spatial model of the first host-parasitoid
system is introduced. We analyze the model, describing its transient behavior
and finding the conditions under which spatial patterns occur, as well as an
estimate of outbreak size under those conditions. We consider the feasibility
of the necessary conditions in the natural system by modeling the mechanisms
responsible for them, and discuss the effects of variable habitat on pattern
formation. We also explore one possible explanation for the persistence of the
second host-parasitoid system -- the existence of an alternate host. Under
certain surprising conditions and by means quite different from previous models
of similar situations, an alternate host can greatly enhance persistence of the
nematode parasitoid.

resultant mass-loss rates range from $10^{-12}$ to $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot/yr$.
Using the mass--loss model we compute infrared stellar luminosities for the

are marginally strong and broad enough to be considered broad absorption lines

2002.18 and 2006.96. A third observation in 2008.48 showed the lines becoming
~40% weaker and 10% to 15% narrower. There is no evidence for acceleration or
for any outflow gas at velocities <23,000 km/s. The lines appear to be
optically thick, with the absorber covering just 20% of the quasar continuum

gradients, the latter caused by variations in the stellar population and/or
obscuring dust. These problems are not present in the $\sim 30$ other black
hole mass determinations from stellar dynamics that have been published by us

observed that, for each nontrivial connected graph, at most five of these nine
numbers can be different, and inequalities between these five numbers are
given. Finally, these fundamental dominations are interpreted in terms of the
total graph of the given graph, a concept introduced by the second author in
1965. It is argued that the very first domination concept, defined by O. Ore in
1962 and under a different name by C. Berge in 1958, deserves to be called the
most fundamental of graph dominations.

capillary flow of liquid helium 4. In the capillary flow, a substantial fall of
the shear viscosity has been observed in the normal phase (lambda
point<T<3.7K). In this temperature region, under the strong influence of Bose
statistics, the coherent many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size
between a macroscopic and a microscopic one, which is different from thermal
fluctuation. We consider such a capillary flow by including it to a general
picture that includes the flow of rotating helium 4 as well. Using the
Kramers-Kronig relation, we express the inverse of the shear viscosity in terms
of the generalized susceptibility of the system, and obtain a formula for the
shear viscosity in the vicinity of the lambda point. Regarding bosons without
the condensate as a non-perturbative state, we make a perturbation calculation
of the susceptibility with respect to the repulsive interaction. With
decreasing temperature from 3.7K, the growth of the coherent wave function
gradually suppresses the shear viscosity, and makes the superfluid flow stable.
Comparing formulas obtained to the experimental data, we estimate that the
ratio of the superfluid density defined in the mechanical sense reaches
1/100000 just above the lambda point.

rotor. By a finite size scaling analysis we have identified a mobility edge for
a certain value of the kicking strength $k = k_c$. For $k > k_c$ dynamical
localization does not occur, all eigenstates are delocalized and the spectral
correlations are well described by Wigner-Dyson statistics. This can be
understood by mapping the kicked rotor problem onto a 3d Anderson model (AM)
where a band of metallic states exists for sufficiently weak disorder. Around
the critical region $k \approx k_c$ we have carried out a detailed study of the
level statistics and quantum diffusion. In agreement with the predictions of
the one parameter scaling theory (OPT) and with previous numerical simulations
of a 3d AM at the transition, the number variance is linear, level repulsion is
still observed and quantum diffusion is anomalous with $<p^2 > \propto
t^{2/3}$. We note that in the 3d kicked rotor the dynamics is not random but
deterministic. In order to estimate the differences between these two
situations we have studied a 3d kicked rotor in which the kinetic term of the
associated evolution matrix is random. A detailed numerical comparison shows
that the differences between the two cases are relatively small. However in the
deterministic case only a small set of irrational periods was used. A
qualitative analysis of a much larger set suggests that the deviations between
the random and the deterministic kicked rotor can be important for certain
choices of periods. Contrary to intuition correlations in the deterministic
case can either suppress or enhance Anderson localization effects.

Although the GLAST burst telescope will be less sensitive than Swift's in the
15--150 keV band, its large field-of-view implies that it will double Swift's
detection rate of LL bursts. We show that Swift, GLAST and EXIST should detect
about 1, 2 & 30 LL GRBs, respectively, over a 5-year operational period. The
burst telescope on EXIST should detect LL GRBs at a rate of more than an order
of magnitude greater than that of Swift's BAT. We show that the detection
horizon for LL GRBs will be extended from $z \simeq 0.4$ for Swift to $z \simeq
1.1$ in the EXIST era. Also, the contribution of LL bursts to the observed GRB
redshift distribution will contribute to an identifiable feature in the
distribution at $z \simeq 1$.

contracting flare loops in the early phase of solar flares. In classical flare
models, which were constructed based on the phenomenon of expansion of flare
loops, an energy releasing site is put above flare loops. These models can
predict that there is a vertical temperature gradient in the top of flare loops
due to heat conduction and cooling effects. Therefore, the centroid of an X-ray
looptop source at higher energy bands will be higher in altitude, for which we
can define as normal temperature distribution. With observations made by {\it
RHESSI}, we analyzed 10 M- or X-class flares (9 limb flares). For all these
flares, the movement of looptop sources shows an obvious U-shaped trajectory,
which we take as the signature of contraction-to-expansion of flare loops. We
find that, for all these flares, normal temperature distribution does exist,
but only along the path of expansion. The temperature distribution along the
path of contraction is abnormal, showing no spatial order at all. The result
suggests that magnetic reconnection processes in the contraction and expansion
phases of these solar flares are different.

observed to spontaneously form cluster and stripe morphologies in certain
systems with isotropic pair potentials between the particles, due to the fact
that the pair interaction between the colloids has competing attraction and

functional theory for a model of such a two-dimensional fluid. The theory
predicts a bulk phase diagram exhibiting cluster, stripe and bubble modulated

results for this model from the literature, we find that the theory is
qualitatively reliable. The model allows for a detailed investigation of the

$\ell_1$ and $\ell_1+\ell_2$ type penalization schemes. The asymptotic
consistency of variable selection immediately follows from this analysis. We
focus on logistic and linear regression models. The following questions are
central to our paper: given a level of confidence $1-\delta$, under which
assumptions on the design matrix, for which strength of the signal and for what
values of the tuning parameters can we identify the true model at the given
level of confidence? Formally, if $\widehat{I}$ is an estimate of the true
variable set $I^*$, we study conditions under which
$\mathbb{P}(\widehat{I}=I^*)\geq 1-\delta$, for a given sample size $n$, number
of parameters $M$ and confidence $1-\delta$. We show that in identifiable
models, both methods can recover coefficients of size $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, up
to small multiplicative constants and logarithmic factors in $M$ and
$\frac{1}{\delta}$. The advantage of the $\ell_1+\ell_2$ penalization over the
$\ell_1$ is minor for the variable selection problem, for the models we
consider here. Whereas the former estimates are unique, and become more stable
for highly correlated data matrices as one increases the tuning parameter of
the $\ell_2$ part, too large an increase in this parameter value may preclude
variable selection.

during observations acquired by the AGILE satellite in September and October
2007. These detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period of
intense optical activity, which was monitored by GASP-WEBT. This simultaneous
optical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,
time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs)
during different states of activity. AGILE observed the source with its two
co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray
imager (Super-AGILE), which are sensitive to the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV
energy ranges, respectively. Observations were completed in two different
periods, the first between 2007 September 4-23, and the second between 2007
October 24-November 1. Over the period 2007 September 7-12, AGILE detected
gamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with an
average flux (E>100 MeV) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which
increased by a factor of at least four within three days. No emission was
detected by Super-AGILE for the energy range 18-60 keV to a 3-sigma upper limit
of 10 mCrab in 335 ksec. In October 2007, AGILE repointed toward S5 0716+714
following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x
10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. The
gamma-ray flux of S5 0716+714 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected
for this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a BL
Lac object. The SED of mid-September appears to be consistent with the
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model, but only by including two SSC
components of different variabilities.

isotropic-nematic phase transition lines is determined independently. Strong
shear-thinning behaviour is observed due to critical slowing down of
orientational diffusion as a result of the vicinity of the isotropic- nematic
spinodal. This severe shear-thinning behaviour is shown to result in gradient
shear banding. Time-resolved Small angle neutron scattering experiments are
used to obtain insight in the microscopic phenomena that underly the observed
rheological response. An equation of motion for the order-parameter tensor and
an expression of the stress tensor in terms of the order-parameter tensor are
used to interpret the experimental data, both in the linear and non-linear

These well connected nodes tend to dominate the organisation of the network's

detect if the connectivity between the rich nodes is due to chance or caused by
an unknown mechanism. Chance is represented as a reference network obtained
from an ensemble of networks. When compared with the original network the
reference network discounts suggests the existence of a well connected rich
club beyond structural constraints. Here we revise some of the properties of
the ensemble obtained by conserving only the degree distribution and introduce
two new reference networks to study the importance of the rich nodes as
organisers of the network structure. The first reference network is obtained
from an ensemble of networks where all the members of the ensemble have the

one of the main sources of decoherence for spin qubits when the nuclear spins
are disordered. An ordering of the latter largely suppresses this source of
decoherence. Here we show that such an ordering can occur through a
thermodynamic phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) Kondo-lattice type
systems. We specifically focus on nuclear spins embedded in a 2D electron gas.
The nuclear spins interact with each other through the RKKY interaction, which
is carried by the electron gas. We show that a nuclear magnetic order at finite
temperature relies on the anomalous behavior of the 2D static electron spin
susceptibility due to electron-electron interactions. This provides a
connection between low-dimensional magnetism and non-analyticities in
interacting 2D electron systems. We discuss the conditions for nuclear
magnetism, and show that the associated Curie temperature increases with the
electron-electron interactions and may reach up into the millikelvin regime.
The further reduction of dimensionality to one dimension is shortly discussed.

outer disc by the inner disc and coronal emission in black hole binaries. We
apply this to the broadband Swift data from the outburst of the black hole
binary XTE J1817--330 to confirm previous results that the optical/UV emission
in the soft state is consistent with a reprocessing a constant fraction of the
bolometric X-ray luminosity. However, this is very surprising as the disc
temperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which should
produce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. The easiest way to
match the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the disc skin to be
highly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van Paradijs), so that the bulk of
the disc flux is reflected and only the hardest X-rays heat the disc. The
constant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc over
a scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material
(wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines.
By contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor
~6) as the source enters the hard state. This dramatic change is not evident
from X-ray/UV flux correlations as it is masked by bandpass effects. However,
it does not necessarily signal a change in emission e.g. the emergence of the
jet dominating the optical/UV flux as the reflection albedo must change with
the dramatic change in spectral shape.

experimentally by performing constant head permeability tests in a triaxial
cell with different conditions of confining pressure and pore pressure. Test
results have shown that a pore pressure increase and a confining pressure
decrease both result in an increase of the permeability, and that the effect of
the pore pressure change on the variation of the permeability is more important
than the effect of a change of the confining pressure. A power law is proposed
for the variation of the permeability with the effective stress. The
permeability effective stress coefficient increases linearly with the
differential pressure and is greater than one as soon the differential pressure
exceeds few bars. The test results are well reproduced using the proposed
permeability-effective stress law. A conceptual pore-shell model based on a
detailed observation of the microstructure of the studied limestone is
proposed. This model is able to explain the experimental observations on the
effect of the total stress and of the pore pressure on the permeability of the
limestone. Effective stress coefficients for the stress-dependent permeability
which are greater than one are obtained. It is shown that the controlling
factor is the ratio of the different bulk moduli of the various constituents of

(EBL) through the detection of $\gamma$-ray inverse Compton (IC) emission due
to scattering of the EBL photons off relativistic electrons in the lobes of
radio galaxies. Our method has no free physical parameters and is a powerful
tool when the lobes are characterized by a high energy sharp break or cutoff in
their electron energy distribution (EED). We show that such a feature will
produce a high energy IC `imprint' of the EBL spectrum in which the radio lobes
are embedded, and show how this imprint can be used to derive the EBL. We apply
our method to the bright nearby radio galaxy Fornax A, for which we
demonstrate, using WMAP and EGRET observations, that the EED of its lobes is
characterized by a conveniently located cutoff, bringing the IC EBL emission
into the {\sl Fermi} energy range. We show that {\sl Fermi} will set upper
limits to the optical EBL and measure the more elusive infrared EBL.

semiflexible networks. Drawing on simple models of semiflexible worm-like
chains we derive an expression for the probability distribution of crosslink
separations valid at all separations. This accounts for both entropic and
mechanical filament stretching. From this we obtain the free energy density of
such networks explicitly as a function of applied strain. We are therefore able
to calculate the elastic moduli of such networks for any imposed strain or
stress. We find that accounting for the distribution of cross-link separations
destroys the simple scaling of modulus with stress that is well known in single
chains, and that such scaling is sensitive to the mechanical stretch modulus of
individual filaments. We compare this model to three experimental data sets,
for networks of different types of filaments, and find that a properly treated
affine model can successfully account for the data. We find that for networks
of stiffer filaments, such as F-actin, to fit data we require a much smaller
effective persistence length than usually assumed to be characteristic of this
filament type. We propose that such an effectively reduced rigidity of
filaments might be a consequence of network formation.

maximum stellar mass is lower, in low mass clusters, than would be expected on
the basis of random drawing, and have pointed out that this could have
important implications for steepening the integrated initial mass function of
the Galaxy (the IGIMF) at high masses. Our compilation demonstrates how the
observed distribution in the plane of maximum stellar mass versus membership
number is affected by the method of target selection; in particular, rather low
n clusters with large maximum stellar masses are abundant in observational
datasets that specifically seek clusters in the environs of high mass stars.
Although we do not consider our compilation to be either complete or unbiased,
we discuss the method by which such data should be statistically analysed. Our
very provisional conclusion is that the data is not indicating any striking

star formation out of outflowing disks would result in a spread of helium
abundances, thus failing to produce the distinct, chemically homogeneous
sub-populations such as those in the clusters $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808.
Pollution by Population III stars would fail to produce sub-populations
selectively enriched in helium, but maintaining the same abundance of heavy
elements. Still, it is argued that for the AGB option to work two conditions
should be satisfied: i) AGB stars experiencing the hot bottom burning process
(i.e., those more massive than $\sim 3 \msun$) should rapidly eject their
envelope upon arrival on the AGB, thus experiencing just a few third dredge-up
episodes, and ii) clusters with multiple, helium enriched populations should be
the remnants of much more massive systems, such as nucleated dwarf galaxies, as
indeed widely assumed.

measuring slopes or curvatures of Wavefront Errors (WFE) transmitted by a
telescope, subsequently reconstructing WFEs digitally. Such process, however,
does not seem to be well suited for evaluating co-phasing or piston errors of
future large segmented telescopes in quasi real-time. This communication
presents an original, recently proposed technique for direct WFE sensing. The
principle of the device, which is named ""Telescope-Interferometer"" (TI), is
based on the addition of a reference optical arm into the telescope pupil
plane. Then incident WFEs are deduced from Point Spread Function (PSF)
measurements at the telescope focal plane. Herein are described two different
types of TIs, and their performance are discussed in terms of intrinsic
measurement accuracy and spatial resolution. Various error sources are studied
by means of numerical simulations, among which photon noise sounds the most
critical. Those computations finally help to define the application range of

in the high-energy limit. Our main result is an estimate of the deviations from
equidistribution for large well-connected graphs. We use an exact
field-theoretic expression in terms of a variant of the supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma-model. Our estimate is based on a saddle-point analysis of this
expression and leads to a criterion for when equidistribution emerges
asymptotically in the limit of large graphs. Our theory predicts a rate of
convergence that is a significant refinement of previous estimates,
long-assumed to be valid for quantum chaotic systems, agreeing with them in
some situations but not all. We discuss specific examples for which the theory
is tested numerically.

the task of Inferential Statistics. Information Theory provides us with a basic
functional, the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence), an
asymmetrical measure of dissimilarity between the empirical and the theoretical
distributions. The formal properties of the relative entropy turn out to be
able to capture every aspect of Inferential Statistics, as illustrated here,
for simplicity, on dices (= i.i.d. process with finitely many outcomes):
refutability (strict or probabilistic): the asymmetry data / models; small
deviations: rejecting a single hypothesis; competition between hypotheses and
model selection; maximum likelihood: model inference and its limits; maximum
entropy: reconstructing partially observed data; EM-algorithm; flow data and
gravity modelling; determining the order of a Markov chain.

four-point scattering amplitude of N=8 supergravity in which all ultraviolet
cancellations are made manifest. The Feynman loop integrals that appear have a
graphical representation with only cubic vertices, and numerator factors that
are quadratic in the loop momenta, rather than quartic as in the previous form.
This quadratic behavior reflects cancellations beyond those required for
finiteness, and matches the quadratic behavior of the three-loop four-point
scattering amplitude in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. By direct integration we
confirm that no additional cancellations remain in the N=8 supergravity
amplitude, thus demonstrating that the critical dimension in which the first
ultraviolet divergence occurs at three loops is D_c=6. We also give the values
of the three-loop divergences in D=7,9,11. In addition, we present the
explicitly color-dressed three-loop four-point amplitude of N=4
super-Yang-Mills theory.

obscured and reddened by dust in their host galaxies, the wavelength-dependence
and quantity of dust extinction are still poorly known. Current studies on this
mostly rely on fitting the afterglow spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with
template extinction models. The inferred extinction (both quantity and
wavelength-dependence) and dust-to-gas ratios are often in disagreement with
that obtained from dust depletion and X-ray spectroscopy studies. We argue that
this discrepancy could result from the prior assumption of a template
extinction law. We propose an analytical formula to approximate the GRB host
extinction law. With the template extinction laws self-contained, and the
capability of revealing extinction laws differing from the conventional ones,
it is shown that this is a powerful approach in modeling the afterglow SEDs to
derive GRB host extinction.
