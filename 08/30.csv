point-spread function for the TRACE EUV solar telescope, we have measured the
effect of stray light in that telescope. We find that 43% of 171A EUV light
that enters TRACE is scattered, either through diffraction off the entrance
filter grid or through other nonspecular effects. We carry this result forward,
via known-PSF deconvolution of TRACE images, to identify its effect on analysis
of TRACE data. Known-PSF deconvolution by this derived PSF greatly reduces the
effect of visible haze in the TRACE 171A images, enhances bright features, and
reveals that the smooth background component of the corona is considerably less
bright (and hence much more rarefied) than commonly supposed. Deconvolution
reveals that some prior conlclusions about the Sun appear to have been based on
stray light in the images. In particular, the diffuse background ""quiet corona""
becomes consistent with hydrostatic support of the coronal plasma; feature
contrast is greatly increased, possibly affecting derived parameters such as
the form of the coronal heating function; and essentially all existing
differential emission measure studies of small features appear to be affected
by contamination from nearby features. We speculate on further implications of
stray light for interpretation of EUV images from TRACE and similar
instruments, and advocate deconvolution as a standard tool for image analysis
with future instruments such as SDO/AIA.

the scatter by correlating it with quantities that are closely related to
clusters' formation and merging histories. We also examine the distribution of
the scatter for merging and nonmerging populations, identified using halo
merger trees derived from the simulation as well as X-ray substructure

clusters tend to be cooler than clusters with similar masses. No bias is found
between the merging and relaxed clusters, but merging clusters generally have
greater scatter, which is related to the properties of the distribution of halo
concentrations. We also detect a signature of non-lognormality in the
distribution of scatter for our simulated clusters both at z=0 and at z=1. A
detailed comparison of merging clusters identified by substructure measures and
by halo merger trees is given in the discussion. We conclude that, when
cooling-related effects are neglected, the variation in halo concentrations is
a more important factor for driving the intrinsic scatter in the M-T_X

that the colliding winds region is responsible for the blue wing absorption. By
fitting observations, we find that the maximum outflow velocity of this
absorbing material is ~2300 km/s. We also assume that the secondary star is
toward the observer at periastron passage. With a toy-model we achieve two
significant results. (1) We show that the semimajor axis orientation we use can
account for the appearance and evolution of the wide blue wing under our basic

with an instantaneous noiseless feedback, and show how rates corresponding to
the empirical behavior of the channel can be attained, although no rate can be
guaranteed in advance. First, we consider a discrete modulo-additive channel
with alphabet $\mathcal{X}$, where the noise sequence $Z^n$ is arbitrary and
unknown and may causally depend on the transmitted and received sequences and
on the encoder's message, possibly in an adversarial fashion. Although the
classical capacity of this channel is zero, we show that rates approaching the
empirical capacity $\log|\mathcal{X}|-H_{emp}(Z^n)$ can be universally
attained, where $H_{emp}(Z^n)$ is the empirical entropy of $Z^n$. For the more
general setting where the channel can map its input to an output in an
arbitrary unknown fashion subject only to causality, we model the empirical
channel actions as the modulo-addition of a realized noise sequence, and show
that the same result applies if common randomness is available. The results are
proved constructively, by providing a simple sequential transmission scheme
approaching the empirical capacity. In part II of this work we demonstrate how
even higher rates can be attained by using more elaborate models for channel
actions, and by utilizing possible empirical dependencies in its behavior.

employing multi-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport and an effective
relativistic gravitational potential. Testing the influence of a stiff and a
soft equation of state for hot neutron star matter, we find that the non-radial
mass motions in the supernova core due to the standing accretion shock
instability (SASI) and convection impose a time variability on the neutrino and
gravitational-wave signals. These variations have larger amplitudes as well as
higher frequencies in the case of a more compact nascent neutron star. After
the prompt shock-breakout burst of electron neutrinos, a more compact accreting
remnant radiates neutrinos with higher luminosities and larger mean energies.
The observable neutrino emission in the direction of SASI shock oscillations
exhibits a modulation of several 10% in the luminosities and ~1 MeV in the mean
energies with most power at typical SASI frequencies of 20-100 Hz. At times
later than 50-100 ms after bounce the gravitational-wave amplitude is dominated
by the growing low-frequency (<200 Hz) signal associated with anisotropic
neutrino emission. A high-frequency wave signal is caused by nonradial gas
flows in the outer neutron star layers, which are stirred by anisotropic
accretion from the SASI and convective regions. The gravitational-wave power
then peaks at about 300-800 Hz with distinctively higher spectral frequencies
originating from the more compact and more rapidly contracting neutron star.
The detectability of the SASI effects in the neutrino and gravitational-wave

accretion flows into a Schwarzschild black hole by 2D general relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations as well as linear analysis in the equatorial plane. We
demonstrate that the accretion shock is stable against axisymmetric
perturbations but becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. The
results of dynamical simulations show good agreement with linear analysis on
the stability, oscillation and growing time scales. The comparison of different
wave-travel times with the growth time scales of the instability suggests that
the instability is likely to be of the Papaloizou-Pringle type, induced by the
repeated propagations of acoustic waves. However, the wavelengths of
perturbations are too long to clearly define the reflection point. By analyzing
the non-linear phase in the dynamical simulations, it is shown that quadratic
mode couplings precede the non-linear saturation. It is also found that not
only short-term random fluctuations by turbulent motions but also quasi
periodic oscillations take place on longer time scales in the non-linear phase.
We give some possible implications of the instability for quasi periodic
oscillations (QPOs) and the central engine for gamma ray bursts (GRBs).

of [Ne II] as a tracer of the current star formation we found similar star
formation rates in Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. We examined the mid- and
far-infrared continua and find that [Ne II] is well correlated with the
continuum luminosity at 60 micron and that both [Ne III] and [O IV] are better
correlated with the 25 micron luminosities than with the continuum at longer

sampling, simulated annealing, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The idea is
to sample a reconstruction sequence from a Boltzmann distribution associated
with an energy function that incorporates the distortion between the source and
reconstruction, the compressibility of the reconstruction, and the point sought
on the rate-distortion curve. To sample from this distribution, we use a `heat
bath algorithm': Starting from an initial candidate reconstruction (say the
original source sequence), at every iteration, an index i is chosen and the
i-th sequence component is replaced by drawing from the conditional probability
distribution for that component given all the rest. At the end of this process,
the encoder conveys the reconstruction to the decoder using universal lossless
compression. The complexity of each iteration is independent of the sequence
length and only linearly dependent on a certain context parameter (which grows
sub-logarithmically with the sequence length). We show that the proposed
algorithms achieve optimum rate-distortion performance in the limits of large
number of iterations, and sequence length, when employed on any stationary
ergodic source. Experimentation shows promising initial results. Employing our
lossy compressors on noisy data, with appropriately chosen distortion measure
and level, followed by a simple de-randomization operation, results in a family
of denoisers that compares favorably (both theoretically and in practice) with
other MCMC-based schemes, and with the Discrete Universal Denoiser (DUDE).

As an illustration we apply our method to simple fluids. The ""exact"" canonical

observation of the L dwarf binary 2MASSW J0746+20. We detect strong radio
emission, dominated by short-duration periodic pulses at 4.86 GHz with
P=124.32+/-0.11 min. The stability of the pulse profiles and arrival times
demonstrates that they are due to the rotational modulation of a B~1.7 kG
magnetic field. A quiescent non-variable component is also detected, likely due
to emission from a uniform large-scale field. The H-alpha emission exhibits
identical periodicity, but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and
is offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase. The sinusoidal variations require
chromospheric emission from a large-scale field structure, with the radio
pulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles. While both light curves can be
explained by a rotating mis-aligned magnetic field, the 1/4 phase lag rules out
a symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2
(poloidal field) or zero (toroidal field). We therefore conclude that either
(i) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration, which can naturally
explain the 1/4 phase lag; or (ii) the H-alpha and/or radio emission regions
are not trivially aligned with the field. Regardless of the field topology, we
use the measured period along with the known rotation velocity (vsini=27 km/s),
and the binary orbital inclination (i=142 deg), to derive a radius for the
primary star of 0.078+/-0.010 R_sun. This is the first measurement of the
radius of an L dwarf, and along with a mass of 0.085+/-0.010 M_sun it provides
a constraint on the mass-radius relation below 0.1 M_sun. We find that the
radius is about 30% smaller than expected from theoretical models, even for an
age of a few Gyr.

subject of vigorous scientific debates since the advent of quantum theory.
Scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner (initially) believed that
wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is caused by the mind of the
observer. It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle
external visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy
and complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to
investigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a
different set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there
is quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material
substrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective
wavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated
that owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in
neurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for
cognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle
way which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and
despite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain
to be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum
states of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for
collapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility
for the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if
we accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them
can provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.

algorithms in separably estimable models, the $\mathcal{NU}$ (with its linear

a \emph{consensus} step (where each sensor updates the state by weight
averaging it with its neighbors' states) and an \emph{innovation} step (where
each sensor processes its local current observation.) This makes the three
algorithms of the \textit{consensus + innovations} type, very different from
traditional consensus. The paper proves consistency (all sensors reach
consensus almost surely and converge to the true parameter value,) efficiency,

asymptotic normality and provides convergence rate guarantees. The three
algorithms are characterized by appropriately chosen decaying weight sequences.

contributes to the anisotropy power spectrum in the multipoles between l=6 to

oscillations with low degree l is dependent primarily on the sound speed
profile within the stellar core, where nuclear evolution occurs. The detection
of such oscillations for a star offers a very good opportunity to determine the
stage of its nuclear evolution, and hence its age. In this context, we
investigate the Sun and alpha Cen A and B. For alpha Cen A and B, each of the
small separations delta nu 01, delta nu 02 and delta nu 13 gives a different
age. Therefore, in our fitting process, we also employ the second difference,
defined as nu n2 - 2 nu n1 + nu n0, which is 2 delta nu 01- delta nu 02. In
addition to this, we also use frequency ratio (nu n0/ nu n2). For the Sun,
these expressions areequivalent and give an age of about 4.9-5.0 Gyr. For alpha
Cen A and B, however, the small separation and the second difference give very
different ages. This conflict may be solved by the detection of oscillation
frequencies that can be measured much more precisely than the current
frequencies. When we fit the models to the observations, we find (i) Z 0=0.020,
t=3.50 Gyr and M B=1.006 Msun from the small separations delta nu 01, delta nu
02 and delta nu 13 of alpha Cen B; and (ii) a variety of solutions from the
non-seismic constraints and delta nu 02 of alpha Cen A and B, in which the
masses of alpha Cen A and B are slightly modified and the age of the system is
about 5.2-5.3 Gyr. For Z=0.025, the closest masses we find to the observed

collectively developed a metric for decentralized wireless network analysis
known as transmission capacity. Although it is notoriously difficult to derive
general end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or \adhoc networks, the
transmission capacity (TC) framework allows for quantification of achievable
single-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/MAC-layer model. By using
stochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, the
relationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability of
transmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed -- often fairly
simply -- in terms of the key network parameters. The basic model and
analytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with path
loss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity
(via lower and upper bounds on outage probability). We then introduce random
channels (fading/shadowing) and give TC and outage approximations for an
arbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special cases
of Rayleigh and Nakagami fading. We then apply these results to show how TC can
be used to better understand scheduling, power control, and the deployment of
multiple antennas in a decentralized network. The paper closes by discussing
shortcomings in the model as well as future research directions.

optimizing a closely-related, but much more manageable, objective function
called variational free energy. In addition to its systematic appeal, there are
several other advantages to this viewpoint. First of all, it provides unified
and rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on
radically different grounds, and facilitates convenient joint detection and
decoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are
incorporated. Secondly, efficient joint parameter estimation and data detection
is possible via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, such
that the detrimental effect of inaccurate channel knowledge at the receiver may

particle-wall interactions, will play a crucial role in determining transport

transport, we consider the diffusion and binding of finite-size particles

t)=M_n(\bphi)+ t J_n(\bphi)$, where $M_n$ is a usual contrast process and $J_n$
a penalty such as the $\ell^1$ norm or the squared $\ell^2$ norm. The function
$\hbbeta_n$ is then called a \emph{regularization path}. For instance we show
that the central limit theorem established for the lasso estimator in Knight
and Fu (2000) continues to hold in a functional sense for the regularization
path. Other examples include various possible contrast processes for $M_n$ such
as those considered in Pollard (1985).

magnetic semiconductors remains a challenge in the case of well controlled
homogeneous alloys, several systems characterized by a strongly inhomogeneous
incorporation of the magnetic component appear as promising. Incorporation of
manganese into germanium drastically alters the growth conditions, and in
certain conditions of low temperature Molecular Beam Epitaxy it leads to the
formation of well organized nanocolumns of a Mn-rich material, with a
crystalline structure in epitaxial relationship with the Mn-poor germanium
matrix. A strong interaction between the Mn atoms in these nanocolums is
demonstrated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy, giving rise to a ferromagnetic
character as observed through magnetometry and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism. Most interesting, intense magneto-transport features are observed on
the whole structure, which strongly depend on the magnetic configuration of the
nanocolumns.

Multiple-Scattering-Theory (FP-MST), valid both for continuum and bound states,
that is free from the drawbacks that up to now have impaired its development,
in particular the need to use cell shape functions and rectangular matrices. In
this connection we give a new scheme to generate local basis functions for the
truncated potential cells that is simple, fast, efficient, valid for any shape
of the cell and reduces to the minimum the number of spherical harmonics in the
expansion of the scattering wave function. The method also avoids the need for
saturating 'internal sums' due to the re-expansion of the spherical Hankel
functions around another point in space (usually another cell center). Thus
this approach, provides a straightforward extension of MST in the Muffin-Tin
(MT) approximation, with only one truncation parameter given by the classical
relation $l_{\rm max} = kR_b$, where $k$ is the excited (or ground state)
electron wave vector and $R_b$ the radius of the bounding sphere of the
scattering cell. It is shown that the theory converges absolutely in the
$l_{\rm max} \to \infty$ limit. As a consequence it provides a firm ground to
the use of FP-MST as a viable method for electronic structure calculations and
makes possible the computation of x-ray spectroscopies, notably photo-electron
diffraction, absorption and anomalous scattering among others, with the ease
and versatility of the corresponding MT theory. Some numerical applications of
the theory are presented, both for continuum and bound states.

  Lower Bound to Transmission Power for Multicast","12 pages, 10 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted to Journal on Selected Areas
  in Communications (Underwater Communications and Wireless Networks)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, to establish a tractable model for
the underwater acoustic channel useful for network optimization in terms of
convexity. Second, to propose a network coding based lower bound for
transmission power in underwater acoustic networks, and compare this bound to
the performance of several network layer schemes. The underwater acoustic
channel is characterized by a path loss that depends strongly on transmission
distance and signal frequency. The exact relationship among power, transmission
band, distance and capacity for the Gaussian noise scenario is a complicated
one. We provide a closed-form approximate model for 1) transmission power and
2) optimal frequency band to use, as functions of distance and capacity. The
model is obtained through numerical evaluation of analytical results that take
into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise.
Network coding is applied to determine a lower bound to transmission power for
a multicast scenario, for a variety of multicast data rates and transmission
distances of interest for practical systems, exploiting physical properties of
the underwater acoustic channel. The results quantify the performance gap in
transmission power between a variety of routing and network coding schemes and
the network coding based lower bound. We illustrate results numerically for
different network scenarios.
