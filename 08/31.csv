investigate the presence of excess hard X-rays above the thermal emission. The
BAT clusters do not show significant (e.g. >2 $\sigma$) non-thermal hard X-ray
emission. The only exception is represented by Perseus whose high-energy
emission is likely due to NGC 1275. Using XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, Chandra and
BAT data, we are able to produce upper limits on the Inverse Compton (IC)
emission mechanism which are in disagreement with most of the previously
claimed hard X-ray excesses. The coupling of the X-ray upper limits on the IC
mechanism to radio data shows that in some clusters the magnetic field might be
larger than 0.5 $\mu$G. We also derive the first logN-logS and luminosity
function distribution of galaxy clusters above 15 keV.

respectively) are studied by means of the density matrix renormalization group

shown that in such a spin-1/2 AF system, there is a gap from the singlet ground
state to the triplet excited states in the absence of a magnetic field. The
spin-spin correlation function decays exponentially, and the gapped states have
a nonvanishing string order, which measures a hidden symmetry in the system. By
a dual transformation, the string order is transformed into a ferromagnetic
order and the hidden symmetry is unveiled to be a $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ discrete
symmetry, which is fully broken in the gapped states. This half-integer spin
Heisenberg AF chain is in a Haldane-like phase, suggesting that the present
findings extend the substance of Haldane's scenario. A valence-bond-solid state
picture is also proposed for the gapped states.

eigenvalues and of pairs were found by Wegner and by Minami. Our work was
motivated by perturbative explorations of the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation,
where linear combinations of eigenvalues are the denominators and evaluation of
their smallness is crucial.

investigated in FeSex (x = 0.80, 0.88). The magnetization curves display
anomaly at Ts1 106 K and Ts2 78 K except for the superconducting diamagnetic
transition around Tc 8 K. The magnetic anomaly at Ts1 and Ts2 can be related to
a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic phase transition, respectively, as
revealed by specific heat measurements. The application of pressure not only
raises Tc, but also increases both Ts1 and Ts2. This system shows clear
evidence that superconductivity arises in a phase with strong magnetic
character and the superconductivity coexists with magnetism. In addition, the
specific heat anomaly associated with the superconducting transition seems to
be absent.

We show that the Onsager coupling between different contributions to the
entropy production is responsible for the scaling of the mean square
displacement on particle diameter and applied strain. We also show that the
shear-induced effective diffusion coefficient depends on the volume fraction
and use Lattice-Boltzmann simulations to characterize the effect through the
power spectrum of particle positions for different Reynolds numbers and volume

systematically reviewed and applied to the calculation of all the

By choosing suitable chiral currents, the light-cone sum rules for all the form
factors are greatly simplified and depend mainly on one leading twist
distribution amplitude of the light meson. As a result, relations between these
form factors arise naturally. At the considered accuracy these relations
reproduce the results obtained in the literature. Moreover, since the explicit
dependence on the leading twist distribution amplitudes is preserved, these
relations may be more useful to simulate the experimental data and extract the
information on the distribution amplitude.

complex linear representations of dimension n. Let $\zeta(G,s) =
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} r_n(G) n^{-s}$ be its representation zeta function.
  First, in case G is a permutational wreath product of H with a permutation
group Q acting on a finite set X, we establish a formula for $\zeta(G,s)$ in
terms of the zeta functions of H and of subgroups of Q, and of the Moebius
function associated with the lattice of partitions of X in orbits under
subgroups of Q.
  Then, we consider groups W(Q,k) which are k-fold iterated wreath products of
Q, and several related infinite groups W(Q), including the profinite group, a
locally finite group, and several finitely generated groups, which are all
isomorphic to a wreath product of themselves with Q. Under convenient
hypotheses (in particular Q should be perfect), we show that r_n(W(Q)) is
finite for all n, and we establish that the Dirichlet series $\zeta(W(Q),s)$
has a finite and positive abscissa of convergence s_0.
  Moreover, the function $\zeta(W(Q),s)$ satisfies a remarkable functional
equation involving $\zeta(W(Q),es)$ for e=1,...,|X|. As a consequence of this,
we exhibit some properties of the function, in particular that $\zeta(W(Q),s)$
has a singularity at s_0, a finite value at s_0, and a Puiseux expansion around
s_0.
  We finally report some numerical computations for Q the simple groups of
order 60 and 168.
