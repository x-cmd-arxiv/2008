different bands, has emerged as a possible explanation of some of the main
characteristics of the recently discovered iron pnictides. A key feature of
such interband pairing mechanism is that it can generate or enhance
superconducting pairing irrespective of whether it is attractive or repulsive.
The latter case typically leads to the superconducting gap switching its sign
among different sections of the Fermi surface. In iron pnictides, the natural
scenario is that the gap changes sign between the hole and the electron Fermi
surfaces. However, the macroscopic symmetry of such an extended s'-wave state
still belongs to the general s-wave category, raising the question of how to
distinguish it from an ordinary s-wave. In such a quest, it is essential to use
experimental techniques that have a momentum space resolution and can probe
momenta of order M, the wavevector that separates the hole and the electron
Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin zone. Here we study experimental signatures in
the spin fluctuation dynamics of the fully-gapped s- and s'-wave
superconducting states, as well as those of the nodal d- and p-wave. The
coupling between spin fluctuations of the incipient nearly-nested spin
density-wave (SDW) and the Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles of the
superconducting state leads to the Landau-type damping of the former. The
intrinsic structure of the superconducting gap leaves a distinctive signature
in the form of this damping, allowing it to be used to diagnose the nature of
iron-based superconductivity in neutron scattering and other experiments
sensitive to spin fluctuations in momentum space. We also discuss the
coexistence between superconductivity and SDW order.

time-reversal symmetric in the absence of a magnetic field but the

HXR emission are situated mainly inside the footpoints of the flare arcade
loops observed by the TRACE and SOHO instruments. At least one of the sources
moves systematically both during the QPP-phase and after it in each flare that
allows to examine the sources velocities and the energy release rate via the
process of magnetic reconnection. The sources move predominantly parallel to
the magnetic inversion line or the appropriate flare ribbon during the
QPP-phase whereas the movement slightly changes to more perpendicular regime
after the QPPs. Each QPP is emitted from its own position. It is also seen that
the velocity and the energy release rate don't correlate well with the flux of
the HXR emission calculated from the sources. The sources of microwaves and
thermal HXRs are situated near the apex of the loop arcade and are not
stationary either. Almost all QPPs and some spikes of HXR emission during the
post-QPP-phase reveal the soft-hard-soft spectral behavior indicating separate
acts of electrons acceleration and injection, rather than modulation of
emission flux by some kinds of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of
coronal loops. In all likelihood, the flare scenarios based on the successively
firing arcade loops are more preferable to interpret the observations, although
we can not conclude exactly what mechanism forces these loops to flare up.

dependence of the maximally achievable alignment and its intensity dependence
are investigated. In a next step, we examine resonant x-ray absorption as an
accurate tool to study laser manipulation of molecular rotation. Specifically,
we investigate the impact of the x-ray pulse duration on the signal
(particularly its temporal resolution), and study the temperature dependence of
the achievable absorption. Most importantly, we demonstrated that using
picosecond x-ray pulses, one can accurately measure the expectation value
<cos^2 theta>(t) for impulsively aligned CF3Br molecules. We point out that a
control of the rotational dynamics opens up a novel way to imprint shapes onto
long x-ray pulses on a picosecond time scale. For our computations, we
determine the dynamic polarizability tensor of CF3Br using ab initio molecular
linear-response theory in conjunction with wave function models of increasing
sophistication: coupled-cluster singles (CCS), second-order approximate
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CC2), and coupled-cluster singles and
doubles (CCSD).

only been observed in spherical systems. We find that this instability occurs
also in triaxial systems, as we checked by performing extensive N-body
simulations whose initial conditions were obtained by sampling a
self-consistent triaxial model of a cuspy galaxy composed of luminous and dark
matter. N-body simulations show a time evolution of the galaxy that is not due
to the development of chaotic motions but, rather, to the collective
instability induced by an excess of box-like orbits. The instability quickly
transforms such models into a more prolate configuration, with 0.64<b/a<0.77
and 0.6<c/a<0.7 for the dark halo and 0.64<b/a<0.77 and 0.59<c/a<0.67 for the
luminous matter. Stable triaxial, cuspy galaxies with dark matter halos are
obtained when the contribution of radially-biased orbits to the solution is
reduced. These results constitute the first evidence of the radial-orbit
instability in triaxial galaxy models.

center-of-mass density correlator at the structure factor peak, the
$\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_{2}$ of the reorientational correlator, and the
translational ($D_{t}$) and rotational ($D_{r}$) diffusion constants. We find
that the coupling between the relaxation times $\tau_{q^{*}}^{\rm C}$ and
$\tau_{2}$ increases with decreasing temperature $T$, whereas the coupling
decreases between the diffusivities $D_{t}$ and $D_{r}$. In addition, the
$T$-dependence of $D_{t}$ decouples from that of $1/\tau_{2}$, which is
consistent with previous experiments and has been interpreted as a signature of
the ""translation-rotation decoupling."" We trace back these apparently
contradicting observations to the dynamical heterogeneities in the system. We
show that the decreasing coupling in the diffusivities $D_{t}$ and $D_{r}$ is
only apparent due to the inadequacy of the concept of the rotational diffusion
constant for describing the reorientational dynamics in the supercooled state.
We also argue that the coupling between $\tau_{q^{*}}^{\rm C}$ and $\tau_{2}$
and the decoupling between $D_{t}$ and $1/\tau_{2}$, both of which strengthen
upon cooling, can be consistently understood in terms of the growing dynamic
length scale.

antiferromagnetic chain with magnetic impurity and one altered link. In this
two parameters (competing interactions) model, one can find the complex phase
diagram with many interesting fixed points. There is no evidence of
intermediate stable fixed point in weak coupling phase. It may arise at the
strong coupling phase. Depending on the strength of couplings the phases
correspond either to a decoupled spin with Curie law behavior or a
logarithmically diverging impurity susceptibility as in the two channel Kondo

impacted the Earth. The high temperature ended the great glaciation,
facilitated the communication of biological information. The rapid change of
Earth environment enkindled the genesis-control system, and released the HSP-90

minimizing process, and the equilibrium solute-solvent interface is an output
of this process. The method is implemented and applied to the solvation of
nonpolar molecules such as two xenon atoms, two parallel paraffin plates,
helical alkane chains, and a single fullerene $C_{60}$. The level-set solutions
show good agreement for the solvation energies when compared to available

range of the thermal energy the dumbbell diffusion exhibits a pronounced local
maximum at a wavelength of about 3/2 of the dumbbell extension. This is

\in \Re^n$ from highly corrupted linear measurements $\y = A\x + \e \in \Re^m$,
where $\e$ is an unknown error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded.
Motivated by an observation from face recognition in computer vision, this
paper proves that for highly correlated (and possibly overcomplete)
dictionaries $A$, any non-negative, sufficiently sparse signal $\x$ can be
recovered by solving an $\ell^1$-minimization problem: $\min \|\x\|_1 +
\|\e\|_1 \quad {subject to} \quad \y = A\x + \e.$ More precisely, if the
fraction $\rho$ of errors is bounded away from one and the support of $\x$
grows sublinearly in the dimension $m$ of the observation, then as $m$ goes to
infinity, the above $\ell^1$-minimization succeeds for all signals $\x$ and
almost all sign-and-support patterns of $\e$. This result suggests that
accurate recovery of sparse signals is possible and computationally feasible
even with nearly 100% of the observations corrupted. The proof relies on a
careful characterization of the faces of a convex polytope spanned together by
the standard crosspolytope and a set of iid Gaussian vectors with nonzero mean
and small variance, which we call the ``cross-and-bouquet'' model. Simulations
and experimental results corroborate the findings, and suggest extensions to
the result.

of the anisotropy energy of the particle cores, calculated by multiplying the
volume distribution by the core anisotropy, and of the total anisotropy energy,
deduced by deriving the master curve of the magnetic relaxation with respect to
the scaling variable $T\ln(t/\tau_0)$, enables the determination of the surface
anisotropy as a function of the particle size. We show that the contribution of
the particle surface to the total anisotropy energy can be well described by a
size--independent value of the surface energy per unit area which permits the
superimposition of the distributions corresponding to the particle core and
effective anisotropy energies. The method is applied to a ferrofluid composed
of non-interacting Fe$_{3-x}$O$_{4}$ particles of 4.9 nm in average size and
$x$ about 0.07. Even though the size distribution is quite narrow in this
system, a relatively small value of the effective surface anisotropy constant
$K_{s}=2.9\times 10^{-2}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ gives rise to a dramatic broadening of
the total energy distribution. The reliability of the average value of the
effective anisotropy constant, deduced from magnetic relaxation data, is
verified by comparing it to that obtained from the analysis of the shift of the
ac susceptibility peaks as a function of the frequency.

of interest in the sky is invariant over time and the frequency range of
observation. However, in reality this assumption does not hold, due to

Single-dish monitoring with a sufficiently dense time sampling and a carefully
calibrated polarimeter, in combination with VLBI observations, are suited to
detect and locate a periodic modulation of the circular maser polarization due
to a precessing Jovian magnetosphere. The phenomenon will be rare, because a
favourable arrangement of maser and magnetosphere is needed, otherwise the

unsaturated. Linear polarization, though exhibiting a qualitatively similar
modulation, is likely to suffer more from confusion due to beam dilution, even

been proposed as flexible and cost-effective instruments for biodiversity
conservation on private lands. Trading the service of conservation requires one
to define a metric that determines the extent to which a conserved site adds to
the regional conservation objective. Yet, while markets for conservation are
widely discussed and increasingly applied, little research has been conducted
on explicitly accounting for spatial ecological processes in the trading. In
this paper, we use a coupled ecological economic simulation model to examine
how spatial connectivity may be considered in the financial incentives created
by a market-based conservation scheme. Land use decisions, driven by changing
conservation costs and the conservation market, are simulated by an agent-based
model of land users. On top of that, a metapopulation model evaluates the
conservational success of the market. We find that optimal spatial incentives
for agents correlate with species characteristics such as the dispersal
distance, but they also depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of
conservation costs. We conclude that a combined analysis of ecological and
socio-economic conditions should be applied when designing market instruments
to protect biodiversity.

accurately tracing the emission), while the type Ic population accurately
traces the H-alpha emission. This implies that the main core-collapse supernova
types form a sequence of increasing progenitor mass, from the type II, to Ib

that at least the majority of these SNe do not arise from the most massive

feature of cooling-core galaxy clusters. These abundance peaks have a much
broader profile than the stars of the central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG),
which produce the excess iron, indicating that metal-enriched plasma is
transported out of the BCG by some process such as turbulent diffusion. At the
same time, cooling-core clusters are likely heated by central active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) by means of jets, cosmic-ray bubbles, and convection. The recent
AGN-driven convection model of Chandran&Rasera predicts the turbulent velocity
profile in a steady-state cluster in which radiative cooling is balanced by
heating from a combination of AGN-driven convection and thermal conduction. We
use the velocity profiles as input into an advection/diffusion model for the
transport of metals in the intracluster medium, taking the iron to be injected
by the BCG. We compare the results of our model to XMM and Chandra observations
of eight clusters. Assuming a constant turbulence level over a cluster's
lifetime, the turbulent velocities in the model can explain the observed
abundance profiles in only five of the eight clusters. However, we go on to
develop an analytic fit of the turbulent velocity profile as a function of the
AGN power. We then deduce for each cluster the average AGN power (during the
past 10 Gyr) required to match the abundance profiles. The required average
values are between 10^43 and 2.10^44 erg/s, while the present AGN powers span a
much larger range from 6.10^41 (Virgo) to 2.10^44 erg/s (Hydra A). Our results
suggest that AGN-driven convection can account for the observed abundance
profiles if the AGN power varies over a cluster's lifetime between Virgo-like
and Hydra-A-like values, with average values in the above-quoted range.

computation based on parametric Product Partition Models. Value-at-Risk is a
standard tool to measure and control the market risk of an asset or a
portfolio, and it is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is
partly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use
of Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in
presence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for
Value-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a
product partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition
structure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian
stock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that
Product Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify
market risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full
agreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides
richer information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence
of outlying points.

mission scheduled for launch around 2017. The actively cooled (<5 K), single
aperture telescope and monolithic mirror will operate from ~3.5 to ~210 um and
will provide superb sensitivity in the mid- and far-IR spectral domain (better
than JWST at lambda > 18 um). SPICA is one of the few space missions selected
to go to the next stage of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 selection process. In
this White Paper we present the main specifications of the three instruments
currently baselined for SPICA: a mid-infrared (MIR) coronagraph (~3.5 to ~27
um) with photometric and spectral capabilities (R~200), a MIR wide-field camera
and high resolution spectrometer (R~30,000), and a far-infrared (FIR ~30 to
~210 um) imaging spectrometer - SAFARI - led by a European consortium. We
discuss their capabilities in the context of MIR direct observations of
exo-planets (EPs) and multiband photometry/high resolution spectroscopy
observations of transiting exo-planets. We conclude that SPICA will be able to
characterize the atmospheres of transiting exo-planets down to the super-Earth
size previously detected by ground- or space-based observatories. It will also
directly detect and characterize Jupiter/Neptune-size planets orbiting at
larger separation from their parent star (>5-10 AU), by performing quantitative
atmospheric spectroscopy and studying proto-planetary and debris disks. In
addition, SPICA will be a scientific and technological precursor for future,
more ambitious, IR space missions for exo-planet direct detection as it will,
for example, quantify the prevalence exo-zodiacal clouds in planetary systems
and test coronographic techniques, cryogenic systems and lightweight, high
quality telescopes. (abridged)

unique in the sense it combined Pauling's classic idea of resonating valence
bond physics with band theory to obtain some exciting results for
superconductivity. Black-Schaffer and Doniach took this approach further and
found an unconventional d + id order parameter. To sharpen our theory and get
more convincing and reliable results for superconductivity, we introduce a
correlated variational BCS ground state wavefunction and perform extensive
Monte Carlo study of the repulsive Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We
find that undoped graphene is not a superconductor, consistent with experiments

This model has the property that the dark matter is {\it necessarily warm}. In
the case where M_{\bar{\chi}} is mainly due to electroweak symmetry breaking,
the \bar{\chi} mass is completely determined by its relic density and the

more precise values of the stellar parameters like mass, gravity, effective

the detection of stellar oscillations is obtained with the same instruments as

time scales however are very different, as the oscillations of solar type stars
have periods around five to ten minutes, while the exoplanets orbits may go

the current ~ 10^{-12} to 10^{-16} - 10^{-18}. If the muon (bound to the
nucleus) could be polarised, a spin asymmetry of the final state electron is
sensitive to CP violating phases on lepton flavour violating operators. This is
similar to extracting phases from asymmetries in the final state spin and phase
space distributions of mu to 3e and mu to e gamma.

BaSTI stellar evolution database, which consists of a large set of homogeneous
models and tools for population synthesis studies. Here we present a new set of
low and high resolution synthetic spectra based on the BaSTI stellar models,
covering a large range of simple stellar populations (SSPs) for both scaled
solar and alpha-enhanced metal mixtures. This enables a completely consistent
study of the photometric and spectroscopic properties of both resolved and
unresolved stellar populations, and allows us to make detailed tests on their
integrated properties. Our low resolution spectra are suitable for deriving
broadband magnitudes and colors in any photometric system. These spectra cover
the full wavelength range (9-160000nm) and include all evolutionary stages up
to the end of AGB evolution. Our high resolution spectra are suitable for
studying the behaviour of line indices and we have tested them against a large
sample of Galactic globular clusters. We find that the range of ages, iron
abundances [Fe/H], and degree of alpha-enhancement predicted by the models
matches observed values very well. We have also tested the global consistency
of the BaSTI models by making detailed comparisons between ages and
metallicities derived from isochrone fitting to observed CMDs, and from line
index strengths, for the Galactic globular cluster 47Tuc and the open cluster
M67. For 47Tuc we find reasonable agreement between the 2 methods, within the
estimated errors. From the comparison with M67 we find non-negligible effects
on derived line indices caused by statistical fluctuations, which are a result
of the specific method used to populate an isochrone and assign appropriate
spectra to individual stars. (abridged)

sample of stars ranging from spectral type M0 to M8 aimed at investigating
observationally how dynamo processes operate in stars on both sides of the full
convection threshold (spectral type M4).
  The present paper focuses on early M stars (M0--M3), i.e. above the full
convection threshold. Applying tomographic imaging techniques to time series of
rotationally modulated circularly polarised profiles collected with the NARVAL
spectropolarimeter, we determine the rotation period and reconstruct the
large-scale magnetic topologies of 6 early M dwarfs. We find that early-M stars
preferentially host large-scale fields with dominantly toroidal and
non-axisymmetric poloidal configurations, along with significant differential
rotation (and long-term variability); only the lowest-mass star of our
subsample is found to host an almost fully poloidal, mainly axisymmetric
large-scale field ressembling those found in mid-M dwarfs.
  This abrupt change in the large-scale magnetic topologies of M dwarfs
(occuring at spectral type M3) has no related signature on X-ray luminosities
(measuring the total amount of magnetic flux); it thus suggests that underlying
dynamo processes become more efficient at producing large-scale fields (despite
producing the same flux) at spectral types later than M3. We suspect that this
change relates to the rapid decrease in the radiative cores of low-mass stars
and to the simultaneous sharp increase of the convective turnover times (with
decreasing stellar mass) that models predict to occur at M3; it may also be (at
least partly) responsible for the reduced magnetic braking reported for
fully-convective stars.

the identification of the set of Pareto optimal alternatives. An important

appropriate neighbourhood structure. Unclear in this context remains, how
interdependencies within the fitness landscape affect the resolution of the
problem.
  The paper presents a study of neighbourhood search operators for multiple
objective flow shop scheduling. Experiments have been carried out with twelve
different combinations of criteria. To derive exact conclusions, small problem
instances, for which the optimal solutions are known, have been chosen.
Statistical tests show that no single neighbourhood operator is able to equally
identify all Pareto optimal alternatives. Significant improvements however have
been obtained by hybridising the solution algorithm using a randomised variable
neighbourhood search technique.

coincidences among various data stretches. For some candidates we have also
investigated the change of the signal-to-noise ratio when we increase the
observation time from two to four days. Our analysis has not revealed any

dimensionless gravitational-wave amplitude over the parameter space that we

two arguments of his suggesting that such clocks might behave in a way that
threatens the geometricity of general relativity (GR). The first argument
states that the behaviour of these clocks in the vicinity of a rotating
gravitational source implies a non-geometric element of gravity. I argue that
the phenomenon is best seen as an instance of violation of the 'clock
hypothesis', and therefore does not threaten the geometrical nature of
gravitation. Ahluwalia's second argument, for the 'incompleteness' of general
relativity, involves the idea that flavour-oscillation clocks can detect
constant gravitational potentials. I argue that the purported
'incompleteness-establishing' result is in fact one that applies to all clocks.
It is entirely derivable from GR, does not result in the observability of the
potential, and is not at odds with any of GR's foundations.
