strongly coupled Conformal Field Theory, we study particle creation by an
accelerating mirror. We model the mirror as a gravitating Domain Wall and
consider a CFT coupled to it through gravity, in asymptotically Anti de Sitter
space. This problem (backreaction included) can be solved exactly at one loop.
At strong coupling, this is dual to a Domain Wall localized on the brane in the
Karch-Randall model, which can be fully solved as well. Hence, in this case one
can see how the particle production is affected by A) strong coupling and B)
its own backreaction. We find that A) the amount of CFT radiation at strong
coupling is not suppressed relative to the weak coupling result; and B) once
the boundary conditions in the AdS_5 bulk are appropriately mapped to the
conditions for the CFT on the boundary of AdS_4, the Karch-Randall model and
the CFT side agree to leading order in the backreaction. This agreement holds
even for a new class of self-consistent solutions (the `Bootstrap' Domain Wall
spacetimes) that have no classical limit. This provides a quite precise check
of the holographic interpretation of the Karch-Randall model. We also comment
on the massive gravity interpretation.
  As a byproduct, we show that relativistic Cosmic Strings (pure tension
codimension 2 branes) in Anti de Sitter are repulsive and generate long-range
tidal forces even at classical level. This is the phenomenon dual to particle
production by Domain Walls.

our universe is extra-repulsive ($-p>\rho$). The density of such a

analyze the late stages of the universe evolution and demonstrate that the
presence of the phantom energy in the universe is not enough in itself to
produce the Big Rip. This singularity occurrence requires the fulfillment of
some additional, rather strong conditions. A more probable outcome of the
cosmological evolution is the decay of the phantom field into 'normal' matter.

is the possibility to introduce a cosmological scenario that does not contain a
Big Bang. In the framework of this model the universe eternally expands, while
its density and other physical parameters oscillate over a wide range, never
reaching the Plank values. Thus, the universe evolution has no singularities at

histories of haloes along with subsequent predictions from a semi-analytic
model (SAM) of galaxy formation. To this aim, we use a sample of dark matter
only and non-radiative SPH simulations of four massive clusters. The presence
of gas-dynamical processes (e.g. ram-pressure from the hot ICM) makes haloes
more fragile in the runs which include gas. This results in a 25 per cent
decrease in the total number of subhaloes at z = 0. The impact on the galaxy
population predicted by SAMs is complicated by the presence of ""orphan""
galaxies, i.e. galaxies whose parent substructures are reduced below the
resolution limit of the simulation. In the model employed in our study, these
galaxies survive for a residual merging time that is computed using a variation
of the Chandrasekhar formula. Due to ram-pressure stripping, haloes in gas
simulations tend to be less massive than their counterparts in the dark matter
simulations. The resulting merging times for satellite galaxies are then longer
in these simulations. On the other hand, the presence of gas influences the
orbits of haloes making them on average more circular and therefore reducing
the estimated merging times with respect to the dark matter only simulation.
This effect is particularly significant for the most massive satellites and is
(at least in part) responsible for the fact that brightest cluster galaxies in
runs with gas have stellar masses which are about 25 per cent larger than those
obtained from dark matter only simulations. Our results show that gas-dynamics
has only a marginal impact on the statistical properties of the galaxy
population, but that its impact on the orbits and merging times of haloes
strongly influences the assembly of the most massive galaxies.

spectrum is to calculate the probability of obtaining that value or a larger
value by chance, on the assumption that the time series contains only noise
(e.g. that the measurements were derived from random samplings of a Gaussian
distribution). However, it is known that one should regard this P-Value
approach with caution. As an alternative, we here examine a Bayesian approach
to estimating the significance of a peak in a power spectrum. This approach
requires that we consider explicitly the hypothesis that the time series
contains a periodic signal as well as noise. The challenge is to identify a
probability distribution function for the power that is appropriate for this
hypothesis. We propose what seem to be reasonable conditions to require of this
function, and then propose a simple function that meets these requirements. We
also propose a consistency condition, and check to see that our function
satisfies this condition. We find that the Bayesian significance estimates are
considerably more conservative than the conventional estimates. We apply this
procedure to three recent analyses of solar neutrino data: (a) bimodality of
GALLEX data; (b) power spectrum analysis of Super-Kamiokande data; and (c) the
combined analysis of radiochemical neutrino data and irradiance data.

k[T]/T^n\rtimes C_2 where C_2 is the cyclic group of order two. The motivation
for this is the bijection between parabolic orbits in the nilradical of a
parabolic subgroup of SL_n and certain Delta-filtered modules for the Auslander
algebra of k[T]/T^n as found by Hille and Roehrle and Bruestle et al. Under
this bijection, the Richardson orbit (i.e. the dense orbit) corresponds to the
Delta-filtered module without self-extensions. It has remained an open problem
to describe such a correspondence for other classical groups.
  In this paper, we establish the Auslander algebra of k[T]/T^n\rtimes C_2 as
the right candidate for the orthogonal groups. In particular, for any parabolic
subgroup of an orthogonal group we construct a map from parabolic orbits to
Delta-filtered modules and show that in the case of the Richardson orbit, the
result has no self-extensions. One of the consequences of our work is that we
are able to describe the extensions between special classes of Delta-filtered
modules. In particular, we show that these extensions can grow arbitrarily
large.

massive cluster where the cluster center is resolved into multiple subsources
at cm and infrared wavelengths, a potential proto-Trapezium system. The region
W3 IRS5 was mapped with the PdBI at 1.4mm and 3.4mm in the AB configurations,
observing shock-tracing SiO and SO_2 emission. In the continuum we detect five
sources, one of them for the first time, while counterparts were detected in
the NIR, MIR or at radio wavelengths for the remaining four sources. Three of
the detected sources are within the inner 2100AU, where the protostellar number
density exceeds 10^6 protostars pc^-3 assuming spherical symmetry. Lower limits
for the circumstellar masses of the detected sources were calculated, although
they were strongly affected by the spatial filtering of the interferometer.
However, the projected separations of the sources ranging between ~750 and
~4700AU indicate a multiple, Trapezium-like system. We detected five molecular
outflows in SiO, two of them nearly in the line of sight direction, which
allowed us to see the collapsing protostars in the NIR through the cavities
carved by the outflows. The SO_2 velocity structure indicates a rotating, bound
system, and we find tentative signatures of converging flows as predicted by
the gravoturbulent star formation and converging flow theories. The obtained
data strongly indicate that the clustered environment has a major influence on
the formation of high-mass stars; however, our data do not clearly allow us to
distinguish whether the ongoing star-forming process follows a monolithic

stretching of the unadsorbed part of the polymer close to the adsorbing

evolution, certain effects should be accounted for, such as the preferential
loss of low-mass stars and the retain of stellar remnants. Moreover, the IMF
and metallicity affect photometry as well. Due to their advanced evolutionary
state, globular clusters (GCs) are interesting test cases for cluster models
describing these effects. In this paper we describe cluster models in which the
above effects are included. The photometric evolution of clusters is predicted,
and the results are applied to Galactic GCs. The presented cluster models
represent an analytical description of the evolution of the underlying stellar
mass function due to stellar evolution and dynamical cluster dissolution.
Stellar remnants are included by using initial-remnant mass relations, while
cluster photometry is computed from the Padova 1999 isochrones. Our study shows
that the preferential loss of low-mass stars, the retain of stellar remnants,
as well as IMF and metallicity variations strongly influence the magnitude,
colour and mass-to-light ratio evolution of clusters. The different effects can
be clearly separated with our models. The models are applied to the Galactic GC
population, of which the magnitude, colour and mass-to-light ratio ranges are
well reproduced. We also show that the mass-to-light ratios of clusters of
similar ages and metallicities cannot be assumed to be constant for all cluster
luminosities. Instead, mass-to-light ratio increases with cluster luminosity
and mass. These models underline the importance of detailed cluster models when
considering cluster photometry. With the analytic framework provided in this
paper, observed cluster properties can be interpreted in a more complete
perspective. (Abridged)

at redshifts 0.3 < z < 1.0. We compare the AGN hosts with a sample of
non-active galaxies drawn from the COSMOS field to match the magnitude and
redshift distribution of the AGN hosts. We perform 2-D surface brightness
modeling with GALFIT to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes.
X-ray selected AGN host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaks
between those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominated
systems. We also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies.
Unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results of
these measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point source
component to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. Our concentration
measurements reinforce the findings of our 2-D morphology fits, placing X-ray
AGN hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. AGN host asymmetry
distributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. Combined with a
lack of excess companion galaxies around AGN, the asymmetry distributions
indicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among AGN than normal
galaxies. In light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxies
of AGN at these X-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominated
to bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered by
major mergers.

we study the possibility of dynamo action driven by a stochastic alpha effect

net growth or decay of the field depends not only on the dynamo parameters but
also on the particular realization, the correlation time of the stochastic
$\alpha$ compared to turbulent diffusion timescale and the time over which the
system is evolved. For dynamos where both a coherent and fluctuating $\alpha$
are present, the stochasticity of $\alpha$ can help alleviate catastrophic
dynamo quenching, even in the absence of helicity fluxes. One can obtain final
field strengths up to a fraction $\sim 0.01$ of the equipartition field $
B_{eq}$ for dynamo numbers $| D| \sim 40$, while fields comparable to $ B_{eq}$
require much larger degree of $\alpha$ fluctuations or shear. This type of
dynamo may be particularly useful for amplifying fields in the central regions
of disk galaxies.

momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy
mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering
becomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary
dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we
investigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within
geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum
transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated
by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good
agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation
of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto
the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital
frequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of
binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the
surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar
dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8
we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~
0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale
is shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun. This implies that gas discs
could commonly attend relatively low mass black hole mergers, and that a
significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few
hundredths of a pc, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive
binaries, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas
disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.

Mills theory which L. Mason formulated in twistor space. The rich structure of
twistor space results in greater gauge freedom compared to the theory in
ordinary space-time. One particular gauge choice, the CSW gauge, allows
simplifications to be made at both the classical and quantum level.
  The equations of motion have an interesting form in the CSW gauge, which
suggests a possible solution procedure. This is explored in three special
cases. Explicit solutions are found in each case and connections with earlier
work are examined. The equations are then reformulated in Minkowski space, in
order to deal with an initial-value, rather than boundary-value, problem. An
interesting form of the Yang-Mills equation is obtained, for which we propose
an iteration procedure.
  The quantum theory is also simplified by adopting the CSW gauge. The Feynman
rules are derived and are shown to reproduce the MHV diagram formalism
straightforwardly, once LSZ reduction is taken into account. The three-point
amplitude missing in the MHV formalism can be recovered in our theory. Finally,
relations to Mansfield's canonical transformation approach are elucidated.

social coalitions and alliances (i.e., long-lasting coalitions) and their
impact on individual power. In most great ape species, coalitions occur at
individual and group levels and among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape
societies remain essentially hierarchical, and coalitions rarely weaken social
inequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to
egalitarianism, and human coalitions and alliances occur not only among
individuals and groups, but also among groups of groups. Here, we develop a
stochastic model describing the emergence of networks of allies resulting from
within-group competition for status or mates between individuals utilizing
dyadic information. The model shows that alliances often emerge in a phase
transition-like fashion if the group size, awareness, aggressiveness, and
persuasiveness of individuals are large and the decay rate of individual
affinities is small. With cultural inheritance of social networks, a single
leveling alliance including all group members can emerge in several
generations. Our results suggest that a rapid transition from a hierarchical
society of great apes to an egalitarian society of hunter-gatherers (often
referred to as ""egalitarian revolution"") could indeed follow an increase in
human cognitive abilities. The establishment of stable group-wide egalitarian
alliances creates conditions promoting the origin of cultural norms favoring
the group interests over those of individuals.

in the early decay slope of the light curves. We conclude that jitter and

shell crossing singularities. These singularities occur when two shell of dust

such that they can be perfectly discriminated. In this paper, we consider a new
scheme of discrimination of quantum gates, called ancilla-assisted
discrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a $d-$dimensional system are
perfectly discriminated with assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla system.
The main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of
quantum gates that can be discriminated in this scheme is evaluated. We prove
that any $rd+1$ quantum gates cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance
from the ancilla, and there exist $rd$ quantum gates which can be perfectly
discriminated with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the
minimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant
positive number $c$ such that for any $k\leq cr$ quantum gates, if they are
$d$-assisted discriminable, then they are also $r$-assisted discriminable, and
there are $c^{\prime}r\textrm{}(c^{\prime}>c)$ different quantum gates which
can be discriminated with a $d-$dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be
discriminated if the ancilla is reduced to an $r-$dimensional system. Thus, the
order $O(r)$ of the number of quantum gates that can be discriminated with
assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in
this paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla
system plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit
of superdense coding.

Bridge exhibited an unwanted, large, side-to-side oscillation which was
apparently due to a resonance between the stepping frequency of walkers and one
of the bridge modes. Models for this event, and similar events on other
bridges, have been proposed. The model most directly addressing the
synchronization mechanism of individual walkers and the resulting global
response of the bridge-pedestrian system is one developed by Eckhardt et al.
This model treats individual walkers with a phase oscillator description and is
inherently high dimensional with system dimensionality (N+2), where N is the
number of walkers. In the present work we use a method proposed by Ott and
Antonsen to reduce the model of Eckhardt et al. to a low dimensional dynamical
system, and we employ this reduced description to study the global dynamics of
the bridge/pedestrian interaction. More generally, this treatment serves as an
interesting example of the possibility of low dimensional macroscopic behavior
in large systems of coupled oscillators.

dynamo, it cannot be sufficient to generate a strong global field, otherwise
the observed X-ray luminosities would be higher. Other explanations for the
circular polarization of SiO masers in the atmospheres are needed. The
interaction of the AGB wind with previously ejected matter and with planets
bears complex magneto-hydrodynamic phenomena on a short time scale, such that
strong magnetic fields can be maintained locally. Here we provide observational
evidence for the corresponding magnetic fluctuations. We trace magnetic
activity with the circular polarization of the v=1, J=2-1 SiO masers, using a
correlation polarimeter. In V Cam and R Leo, we find evidence of
pseudo-periodic fluctuations of the circular polarization on a timescale of a
few hours, from which we infer magnetic fluctuations of ~1G. The phenomenon is
rare and restricted to a narrow range of velocities. It seems to be associated
with planetary wake flows suggested by VLBI maps. While scenarios involving
magnetic activity in the extended stellar atmosphere have problems to explain
all observed features, precessing Jovian magnetospheres predict all of them.
For the case of R Leo, we constrain the orbit of the planet (estimated period
5.2 years) and estimate a stellar mass of 0.7 solar masses.

upper main sequence, white dwarf, and neutron stars. Externally, these fields
have a strong dipolar component, while their internal structure and evolution
are uncertain, but highly relevant for several problems in stellar and
high-energy astrophysics. We discuss the main properties expected for the
stable magnetic configurations in these stars from physical arguments, and how
these properties may determine the modes of decay of these configurations.
Stable magneto-hydrostatic equilibria are likely to exist in stars whenever the
matter in their interior is stably stratified (not barotropic). These
equilibria are not force-free and not required to satisfy the Grad-Shafranov
equation, but they do involve both toroidal and poloidal field components. We
argue that the main mode of decay for these configurations are processes that
lift the constraints set by stable stratification, such as heat diffusion in
main-sequence envelopes and white dwarfs, and beta decays or particle diffusion
in neutron stars. In the former, heat diffusion is not fast enough to make
these equilibria evolve over the stellar lifetime. In neutron stars, a strong
enough field might decay by overcoming the compositional stratification through
beta decays (at the highest field strengths) or through ambipolar diffusion
(for somewhat weaker fields). These processes convert magnetic energy to
thermal energy, and they occur at significant rates only once the latter is
smaller than the former, and therefore they substantially delay the cooling of
the neutron star, while slowly decreasing its magnetic energy.

sublattices $A$ and $B$ correspondingly (i.e. pseudospin polarization). For the
transverse pseudospin polarization the motion of the center of wave packet
occurs in the direction perpendicular to the average momentum $ {\vec
p_0}=\hbar \vec{k_0}$. Moreover, in this case the initial wave packet splits
into two parts moving with opposite velocities along $ {\vec p_0}$. If the
initial direction of pseudospin coincides with average momentum the splitting
is absent and the center of wave packet is displaced at $t>0$ along the same
direction. The results of our calculations show that all types of motion
experience {\it zitterbewegung}. Besides, depending on initial polarization the
velocity of the packet center may have the constant component $v_c=uf(a)$,
where $u\approx 10^8 cm/s$ is the Fermi velocity and $f(a)$ is a function of
the parameter $a=k_0d$ ($d$ is the initial width of wave packet). As a result,
the direction of the packet motion is determined not only by the orientation of
the average momentum, but mainly by the phase difference between the up- and
low- components of the wave functions. Similar peculiarities of the dynamics of
2D electron wave packet connected with initial spin polarization should take
place in the semiconductor quantum well under the influence of the Rashba

supercooled liquid and its slow dynamics at low temperature near glass
transition is studied by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. A Lennard-Jones
liquid with polydispersity in size and mass of constituent particles is chosen
as the model system. Our studies reveal that the local structure (that varies
with polydispersity) plays a crucial role both in the slowing down of dynamics
and in the growth of the dynamic heterogeneities, besides determining the glass
forming ability (GFA) of the system. Increasing polydispersity at fixed volume
fraction is found to suppress the rate of growth of dynamic correlations, as
detected by the growth in the peak of the non-linear density response function.
The growth in dynamical correlation is manifested in a stronger than usual
breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation at lower polydispersity at low
temperatures and also leads to a decrease in the fragility of the system with
polydispersity. We show that the suppression of the rate of growth of the
dynamic heterogeneity can be attributed to the loss of structural correlations
(as measured by the structure factor and the local bond orientational order)
with polydispersity. While a critical polydispersity is required to avoid
crystallization, we find that further increase in polydispersity lowers the
glass forming ability (GFA).

Kolmogorov (and subsequently, Landau in his text on fluid dynamics) and show
that how the 2D turbulence's results, obtainable using other methods, may be
established in a simpler way. Same method is used to calculate some third-order
structure functions for quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence for the forward
cascade of pseudo-potential enstrophy and the inverse energy cascade in
quasi-geostrophic turbulence. These results motivate us to study the two-point
third order structure function in the context of the two-dimensionalisation
effect. Consequent studies enable us to give a reason for the inverse energy
cascade in the two-dimensionalised rapidly rotating three dimensional (3D)
incompressible turbulence. For such a system, literature shows a possibility of
the exponent of wavenumber in the energy spectrum's relation to lie between -2
and -3. We argue the existence of a stricter range of -2 to -7/3 for the
exponent in the case of rapidly rotating turbulence which is in accordance with
the recent experiments. Also, a derivation for the two point third order
structure function has been provided helping one to argue that even with slow
rotation one gets, although dominated, a spectrum with the exponent -2.87,
thereby hinting at the initiation of the two-dimensionalisation effect with
rotation. Moreover, using the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model,

transported to Earth from the planets in extra-solar systems by means of
natural vehicles such as ejecta expelled by comet or asteroid impacts on such
planets. The probabilities of close encounters with other solar systems are
taken into account as well as the limitations of bacterial survival times
inside ejecta in space, caused by radiation and DNA decay. The conclusion is
that no potentially DNA/RNA life-carrying ejecta from another solar system in
the general Galactic star field landed on Earth before life already existed on
Earth, not even if microbial survival time in space is as long as tens of
millions of years. However, if the Sun formed initially as a part of a star
cluster, as is commonly assumed, we cannot rule out the possibility of transfer
of life from one of the sister systems to us. Likewise, there is a possibility
that some extra-solar planets carry life that originated in our solar system.
It will be of great interest to identify the members of the Sun's birth cluster
of stars and study them for evidence for planets and life on the planets. The
former step may be accomplished by the GAIA mission, the latter step by the SIM
and DARWIN missions. Therefore it may not be too long until we have
experimental knowledge on the question whether the natural transfer of life
from one solar system to another has actually taken place.

involves differential equations for quantities representing predator behavior,
namely, the probabilities for attacking prey at the next encounter. Using this

The new results include `temporary' mutualism between prey species, and an
optimal density at which the survival benefit is greatest for the mimic. The

validity of this result is independent of measure theory, on the other hand,
this result together with only elementary functional analysis, can generate
measure theory itself. The mentioned result was also known before the
appearance of measure theory, but the original proof was very complicated. For
this reason this result, when presented in teaching, is generally obtained
based on measure theory. Later, Eberlein gave an elementary, but still
relatively complicated proof, and there were other simpler proofs but burdened
with complicated concepts, like measure theory. In this paper we give a short
and elementary proof even for the following strenghened form of the mentioned
result: a bounded sequence of continuous functions defined on a compact
topological space K pointwise converging to zero, has a suitable
convexification converging also uniformly to zero on $K,$ thus, e.g., the
original sequence converges weakly to zero in C(K). This fact can also be used
in the proof of the Krein-Smulian theorem. The usual proof beyond the simple
tools of the functional analysis, uses heavy embedding theorems and the Riesz'
representation theorem with the whole apparatus of measure theory. Our main
result, however, reduces the cited proof to a form in which we need abstract

pre-explosion images that allow a meaningful search for the progenitor stars.
In five cases they are clearly red supergiants, one case is unconstrained, two
fall on compact coeval star clusters and the other twelve have no progenitor
detected. We review and update all the available data for the host galaxies
(distance, metallicity and extinction) and determine masses and upper mass
estimates using the STARS stellar evolutionary code and a single consistent
homogeneous method. A maximum likelihood calculation suggests that the minimum
stellar mass for a type II-P to form is m(min)=8.5 +1/-1.5 Msol and the maximum
mass for II-P progenitors is m(max)=16.5 +/- 1.5 Msol, assuming a Salpeter
initial mass function (in the range Gamma = -1.35 +0.3/-0.7). The minimum mass
is consistent with current estimates for white dwarf progenitor masses, but the
maximum mass does not appear consistent with massive star populations. Red
supergiants in the Local Group have masses up to 25Msol and the minimum mass to
produce a Wolf-Rayet star in single star evolution (between solar and LMC
metallicity) is similarly 25-30 Msol. We term this discrepancy the ""red
supergiant problem"" and speculate that these stars could have core masses high
enough to form black holes and SNe which are too faint to have been detected.
Low luminosity SNe with low 56Ni production seem to arise from explosions of
low mass progenitors near the mass threshold for core-collapse. (abridged).

few hundred MHz. Since metric type II bursts are thought to be signatures of
propagating shock waves, it is of interest to know how these shocks, and the
type II bursts, are formed. In particular, how are high-frequency, fragmented
type II bursts created? Are there differences in shock acceleration or in the
surrounding medium that could explain the differences to the ""typical"" metric
type IIs? Methods: We analyse one unusual metric type II event in detail, with
comparison to white-light, EUV, and X-ray observations. As the radio event was
associated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME), we investigate their
connection. We then utilize numerical MHD simulations to study the shock
structure induced by an erupting CME in a model corona including dense loops.
Results: Our simulations show that the fragmented part of the type II burst can
be formed when a coronal shock driven by a mass ejection passes through a
system of dense loops overlying the active region.To produce fragmented
emission, the conditions for plasma emission have to be more favourable inside
the loop than in the interloop area. The obvious hypothesis, consistent with
our simulation model, is that the shock strength decreases significantly in the
space between the denser loops. The later, more typical type II burst appears
when the shock exits the dense loop system and finally, outside the active
region, the type II burst dies out when the changing geometry no longer favours
the electron shock-acceleration.

subgroups, Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower
Centaurus-Crux (LCC) which have ages of about 5, 17, and 16 Myr. In Upper
Scorpius, numerous studies have recently revealed hundreds of low-mass
association members, including dozens of brown dwarfs. The empirical mass
function could be established over the full stellar mass range from 0.1 M_sun
up to 20 M_sun, and was found to be consistent with recent determinations of
the field initial mass function. A narrow range of ages around 5 Myr was found
for the low-mass stars, the same age as had previously (and independently) been
derived for the high-mass members. This supports earlier indications that the
star formation process in US was triggered, and agrees with previous
conjectures that the triggering event was a supernova- and wind-driven
shock-wave originating from the nearby UCL group. In the older UCL and LCC
regions, large numbers of low-mass members have recently been identified among
X-ray and proper-motion selected candidates. In both subgroups, low-mass
members have also been serendipitously discovered through investigations of
X-ray sources in the vicinity of better known regions (primarily the Lupus and
TW Hya associations). While both subgroups appear to have mean ages of ~16 Myr,
they both show signs of having substructure. Their star-formation histories may
be more complex than that of the younger, more compact US group. ... (abstract

with excitation and ionization by shock waves so we propose the central object
responsible for powering the nebula. We estimate the parameters of the ionizing
source using photon number estimates and Cloudy modelling. Required EUV
luminosity ($\sim 10^{40}$\ergl) is high even if compared with the X-ray
luminosity. We argue that independently of their physical nature ULXs are
likely to be bright UV and EUV sources. It is shown that the UV flux expected
in the GALEX spectral range (1000-3000Angstroms) is quite reachable for UV
photometry. Measuring the luminosities and spectral slopes in the UV range may
help to distinguish between the two most popular ULX models.

polarized, due to Thomson scattering in a disc atmosphere. In Newtonian space,
the polarization angle must be either parallel or perpendicular to the
projection of the disc axis on the sky. As first pointed out by Stark and
Connors in 1977, General Relativity effects strongly modify the polarization
properties of the thermal radiation as observed at infinity. Among these
effects, the rotation of the polarization angle with energy is particularly
useful as a diagnostic tool.
  In this paper, we extend the Stark and Connors calculations by including the
spectral hardening factor, several values of the optical depth of the
scattering atmosphere and rendering the results to the expected performances of
planned X-ray polarimeters. In particular, to assess the perspectives for the
next generation of X-ray polarimeters, we consider the expected sensitivity of
the detectors onboard the planned POLARIX and IXO missions. We assume the two
cases of a Schwarzschild and an extreme Kerr black hole with a standard thin
disc and a scattering atmosphere. We compute the expected polarization degree
and the angle as functions of the energy as they could be measured for
different inclinations of the observer, optical thickness of the atmosphere and
different values of the black hole spin. We assume the thermal emission

average total and regular magnetic field strengths in M33 as ~ 6.4 and 2.5
$\mu$G, respectively. Under the assumption that the disk of M33 is flat, the
regular magnetic field consists of horizontal and vertical components: however
the inferred vertical field may be partly due to a galactic warp. The
horizontal field is represented by an axisymmetric (m=0) mode from 1 to 3 kpc
radius and a superposition of axisymmetric and bisymmetric (m=0+1) modes from 3
to 5 kpc radius. An excess of differential Faraday rotation in the southern
half together with strong Faraday dispersion in the southern spiral arms seem
to be responsible for the north-south asymmetry in the observed wavelength
dependent depolarization. The presence of an axisymmetric m=0 mode of the
regular magnetic field in each ring suggests that a galactic dynamo is
operating in M33. The pitch angles of the spiral regular magnetic field are
generally smaller than the pitch angles of the optical spiral arms but are
twice as big as simple estimates based on the mean-field dynamo theory and
M33's rotation curve. Generation of interstellar magnetic fields from turbulent
gas motions in M33 is indicated by the equipartition of turbulent and magnetic

establishes the possibility of approximating the steady state statistics in

information about emission in the soft gamma-ray band for many bright sources.
Due to strong and variable instrumental background, only 4 objects have been
detected so far using standard software. The moderate sensitivity of PICsIT can
be compensated for in the case of many objects by adopting a long exposure
time, thanks to INTEGRAL's large field of view. With angular resolution far
higher than that of all other instruments operating in a similar energy band,
PICsIT is suitable for fields too crowded or too significantly affected by
Galactic diffuse emission. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the spectral
extraction software to both obtain more reliable results and enlarge the number
of objects that can be studied. The new PICsIT spectral extraction method is
based on three elements: careful modelling of the background, an
energy-dependent pixel-illumination function, and the computation of the
probability density of the source count rate. The most important element is the
proper treatment of the Poisson-distributed data, developed within a Bayesian
framework. The new method was tested extensively on both a large true data set
and simulated data. Results assumed in simulations were reproduced perfectly,
without any bias and with high precision. Count rates measured for Crab were
far more stable than those obtained with the standard software. For weaker
sources, the new method produced spectra of far higher quality and allows us to
detect at least 8 additional objects. Comparison with other INTEGRAL

information about the continuum emission in the 250 keV -- 1 MeV band.

the viscosity in the disc is negligible. The angular momentum and the
rotational energy of the accreted matter is carried out by a magnetized wind
outflowing from the disc. The outflow of matter from the disc occurs due to the
Blandford & Payne(1982) centrifugal mechanism. The disc is assumed to be cold.
Accretion and outflow are connected by the conservation of the energy, mass and
the angular momentum. The basic properties of the outflow, angular momentum
flux and energy flux per particle in the wind, do not depend on the details of
the structure of the accretion disc. In the case of selfsimilar
accretion/outflow, the dependence of the rate of accretion $\dot M$ in the disc
depends on the disc radius $r$ on the law $\dot M \sim
r^{{1\over2(\alpha^2-1)}}$, where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless Alfvenic radius.
In the case of $\alpha \gg 1$, the accretion in the disc is provided by very
weak matter outflow from the disc and the outflow predominantly occurs from the
very central part of the disc. The solution obtained in the work provides
mechanism which transforms the gravitational energy of the accreted matter into
the energy of the outflowing wind with efficiency close to 100%. The final
velocity can essentially exceed Kepler velocity at the site of the wind launch.
This mechanism allows us to understand the nature of the astrophysical objects

experimentally in transparent models using flexible polyester thread (mean
diameter $280 \mu\mathrm{m}$) and Newtonian and shear thinning fluids. In the
case of smooth parallel walls, fibers of finite length $\ell = 20-150
\mathrm{mm}$ move at a constant velocity of the order of the maximum fluid
velocity in the aperture. In contrast, for fibers lying initially at the inlet
side of the model and dragged by the flow inside it, the velocity increases
with the depth of penetration (this results from the lower velocity - and drag
- in the inlet part). In both cases, the friction of the fiber with the smooth
walls is weak. For rough self-affine walls and a continuous gradient of the
local mean aperture transverse to the flow, transport of the fibers by a water
flow is only possible in the region of larger aperture ($\bar{a} \gtrsim 1.1
\mathrm{mm}$) and is of ""stop and go"" type at low velocities. Time dependent
distorsions of the fiber are also often observed. When water is replaced by a
shear thinning polymer solution, the fibers move faster and continuously in
high aperture regions and their friction with the walls is reduced. Fiber
transport becomes also possible in narrower regions where irreversible pinning
occurred for water. In a third rough model with no global aperture gradient but
with rough walls and a channelization parallel to the mean flow, fiber
transport was only possible in shear-thinning flows and pinning and
entanglement effects were studied.

space-time evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in relativistic heavy
ion collisions and its experimental manifestations. In the following, parton
cascade calculations on elliptic flow and thermalization will be discussed.
Dynamical evolution is shown to be important for the production of elliptic
flow including the scaling and the breaking of the scaling of elliptic flow.
The degree of thermalization is estimated using both an elastic parton cascade
and a radiative transport model. A longitudinal to transverse pressure ratio,
$P_L/P_T\approx 0.8$, is shown to be expected in the central cell in central
collisions. This provides information on viscous corrections to the ideal
hydrodynamical approach.

the new feature of requiring that the contact pairing force reproduce at each
density the $^1S_0$ pairing gap of neutron matter as determined in microscopic
calculations with realistic nucleon-nucleon forces. We retain the earlier
constraints on the Skyrme force of reproducing the energy-density curve of
neutron matter, and of having an isoscalar effective mass of $0.8M$ in
symmetric infinite nuclear matter at the saturation density; we also keep the
recently adopted device of dropping Coulomb exchange. Furthermore, the
correction term for the spurious energy of collective motion has a form that is
known to favour fission barriers that are in good agreement with experiment.
Despite the extra constraints on the effective force, we have achieved a better
fit to the mass data than any other mean field model, the rms error on the 2149
measured masses of nuclei with $N$ and $Z \ge$ 8 having been reduced to 0.632
MeV; the improvement is particularly striking for the most neutron-rich nuclei.
Moreover, it turns out that even with no flexibility at all remaining for the
pairing force, the spectral pairing gaps that we find suggest that level
densities in good agreement with experiment should be obtained. This new force
is thus particularly well-suited for astrophysical applications, such as
stellar nucleosynthesis and neutron-star crusts.

the ""zero sum fallacy"" -- the erroneous belief that one trader in a stock
market exchange can only improve their position provided some other trader's
position deteriorates. However, a positive sum game in absolute terms can be
recast as a zero sum game in relative terms. Similarly it appears that negative
sum games in absolute terms have been recast as zero sum games in relative
terms: otherwise, why would zero sum games be used to represent situations of
war? Such recasting may have heuristic or pedagogic interest but recasting must

fermionic gases, and zeros of the Riemann zeta function to a unique point
process on the real line. Here we analytically provide exact generalizations of
such a point process in d-dimensional Euclidean space for any d, which are
special cases of determinantal processes. In particular, we obtain the
n-particle correlation functions for any n, which completely specify the point
processes. We also demonstrate that spin-polarized fermionic systems have these
same n-particle correlation functions in each dimension. The point processes
for any d are shown to be hyperuniform. The latter result implies that the pair
correlation function tends to unity for large pair distances with a decay rate
that is controlled by the power law r^[-(d+1)]. We graphically display one- and
two-dimensional realizations of the point processes in order to vividly reveal
their ""repulsive"" nature. Indeed, we show that the point processes can be
characterized by an effective ""hard-core"" diameter that grows like the square
root of d. The nearest-neighbor distribution functions for these point
processes are also evaluated and rigorously bounded. Among other results, this
analysis reveals that the probability of finding a large spherical cavity of
radius r in dimension d behaves like a Poisson point process but in dimension
d+1 for large r and finite d. We also show that as d increases, the point
process behaves effectively like a sphere packing with a coverage fraction of
space that is no denser than 1/2^d.

variations in the highly core-dominated, flat-spectrum radio quasar 1156+295

was observed as a part of the MOJAVE survey programme with the VLBA at 15 GHz
on February 5, 2007. Large amplitude variability in the correlated flux
density, unexplainable in terms of the source structure, was first discovered
while processing the data, and later confirmed by calibrating the antenna gains
using 24 other sources observed in the experiment. The source shows variations
in the correlated flux density as high as 40% on a timescale of only 2.7 hours.
This places 1156+295 between the classical IDV sources and the so-called
intra-hour variables. The observed variability timescale and the modulation
index of 13% are consistent with interstellar scintillation by a nearby, highly
turbulent scattering screen. The large modulation index at 15 GHz implies a
scattering measure that is atypically high for a high galactic latitude source
such as 1156+295.

variety of applications, particularly digital microfluidic devices that use
small ""discrete"" fluid volumes (droplets) as fluid carriers and microreactors.
In recent work, we have presented an approach for the generation and control of
mixing inside a translating spherical droplet. This was accomplished by
considering Stokes' flow within a droplet proceeding downstream to which we
have superimposed time dependent (sinusoidal) rotation. The mixing obtained is
the result of the stretching and folding of material lines which increase
exponentially the surface contact between reagents. The mixing strategy relies
on the generation of resonances between the steady and the unsteady part of the
flow, which is achieved by tuning the parameters of the periodic rotation. Such
resonances, in our system, offer the possibility of controlling both the
location and the size of the mixing region within the droplet, which may be
useful to manufacture inhomogeneous particles (such as Janus particles). While
the period and amplitude of the periodic rotation play a major role, it is
shown here by using a triangular function that the particular shape of the
rotation (as a function of time) has a minor influence. This finding
demonstrates the robustness of the proposed mixing strategy, a crucial point
for its experimental realization.
