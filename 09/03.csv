models. A complete classification is obtained for orbifolds X/G with X the
product of three elliptic curves and G an abelian extension of a group (Z_2)^2
of twists acting on X. Each such quotient X/G is shown to give a geometric
interpretation to an appropriate free fermion model, including the geometric
NAHE+ model. However, the semi-realistic NAHE free fermion model is proved to
be non-geometric: its Hodge numbers are not reproduced by any orbifold X/G. In
particular cases it is shown that X/G can agree with some Borcea-Voisin
threefolds, an orbifold limit of the Schoen threefold, and several further
orbifolds thereof. This yields free fermion models with geometric
interpretations on such special threefolds.

support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT
supports calculations for a variety of target geometries. Target materials may
be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to
""import"" arbitrary target geometries into the code. DDSCAT automatically
calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected

fundamental information about the properties of these close binary systems and
about the physics of accretion in general. The detailed diagnostics of
accretion disc structure can be achieved by including in its description all
the relevant heating and cooling physical mechanism, in particular the
convective energy transport that, although dominant at temperatures less than
about 10 000 K, is usually not taken into account when calculating spectra of
accretion discs. We constructed a radiative transfer code coupled with a code
determining the disc's hydrostatic vertical structure. We have obtained for the
first time model spectra of cold, convective accretion discs. As expected,
these spectra are mostly flat in the optical wavelengths with no contribution
from the UV, which in quiescence must be emitted by the white dwarf. The disc
structures obtained with our radiative-transfer code compare well with the
solutions of equations used to describe the dwarf-nova outburst cycle according
to the thermal-viscous disc instability model thus allowing the two to be
combined. Our code allows calculating the spectral evolution of dwarf nova
stars through their whole outburst cycle, providing a new tool for testing
models of accretion discs in cataclysmic variables. We show that convection
plays an important role in determining the vertical disc structure and
substantially affects emitted spectra when, as often the case, it is effective
at optical depths tau ~ 1. The emergent spectrum is independent of the
parameters of the convection model.(Abstract shortened)

created by introducing a new term into the Lagrangian which resulted in a
localised inhomogeneity in the potential terms' coefficient. In the barrier
system, the normal circular path was deformed as the skyrmions traversed the
barrier. During the same period, it was seen that the skyrmions sped up as they
went over the barrier. For critical values of the barrier height and width, the
skyrmions were no longer bound and were free to separate. In the case of a
potential hole, the baby skyrmions no longer formed a bound state and moved
asymptotically along the axis of the hole. It is shown how to modify the
definition of the angular momentum to include the effects of the obstructions,

proposed as a function of length scale. It allows us to quantify the
statistical dissimilarity of the actual macrostate and the maximizing entropy
of the reference one. The maximums (minimums) of the measure indicate those
scales at which higher (lower) average grey level inhomogeneity appears
compared to neighbour scales. Even a deeply hidden statistical grey level
periodicity can be detected by the equally distant minimums of the measure. The
striking effect of multiple intersecting curves (MIC) of the measure has been

symmetry properties, only. This indicates for a non-trivial dependence of the
GLI on length scale. In turn for evolving photosphere granulation patterns, the
stability in time of the first peak position has been found. Interestingly, at
initial steps of the evolution clearly dominates the third peak. This indicates
for a temporary grouping of granules at length scale that may belong to
mesogranulation phenomenon. This behaviour has similarities with that reported

respectively, antisymmetric and symmetric products of density operators of a

equivalence relation is defined in terms of the thermodynamic limit of

appearing in the correspondence are the Fourier components of the
transformation. One is thus left to interpret the CFT as the quantized version

consider possible implications involving understanding the dual of AdS black

long time. However, the probability of detectable pulsations is higher in
transient systems where the mass accretion is sporadic and the neutron star is
likely to have a low mass. We propose this mechanism as the explanation of the

""resonant"" origin. Under this hypothesis, these kinematic structures become a
powerful tool for studying the large-scale structure and dynamics of the Milky
Way. Aims. We aim to characterize these structures in the U-V-age-[Fe/H] space
and establish observational constraints that will allow us to study their
origin and evolution. Methods. We apply multiscale techniques -wavelet
denoising (WD)- to an extensive compendium of more than 24000 stars in the
solar neighbourhood with the best available astrometric, photometric and
spectroscopic data. Results. We confirm that the dominant structures in the U-V
plane are the branches of Sirius, Coma Berenices, Hyades-Pleiades and Hercules,
which are nearly equidistant in this kinematic plane and show a negative slope.
The abrupt drops in the velocity distribution are characterized. We find a
certain dependence of these kinematic structures on Galactic position with a
significant change of contrast among substructures inside the branches. A large
spread of ages is observed for all branches. The Hercules branch is detected in
all subsamples with ages older than ~ 2 Gyr and the set of the other three
branches is well established for stars > 400 Myr. The age-metallicity relation
of each branch is examined and the relation between kinematics and metallicity
is studied. Conclusions. Not all of these observational constraints are
successfully explained by the recent models proposed for the formation of such
kinematic structures. Simulations incorporating stellar ages and metallicities
are essential for future studies. The comparison of the observed and simulated
distributions obtained by WD will provide a physical interpretation of the
existence of the branches in terms of local or large-scale dynamics. [Abridged]

dense hot matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We review the
formulation of Landau hydrodynamics to pave the way for its application in
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It is found that Landau's rapidity
distribution needs to be modified to provide a better quantitative description.
In particular, the rapidity distribution in the center-of-mass system should be
more appropriately given as dN/dy \exp{\sqrt{y_b^2-y^2}}, where
y_b=\ln{\sqrt{s_NN}/m_p} is the beam nucleon rapidity, instead of Landau's
original result of dN/dy({Landau}) \exp{\sqrt{L^2-y^2}} where
L=\ln{\sqrt{s_NN}/2m_p}. The modified distribution is compared with the Landau
distribution and experimental data. It is found that the modified distribution
agrees better with experimental $dN/dy$ data than the Landau distribution and
it differs only slightly from the Landau Gaussian distribution
dN/dy(Landau-Gaussian) \exp{-y^2/2L}. Past successes of the Gaussian
distribution in explaining experimental rapidity data arises, not because it is
an approximation of the original Landau distribution, but because it is in fact
a close representation of the modified distribution.

proceed rapidly, as a strong deflagration, releasing a huge amount of energy in
a short time and generating an extra neutrino burst. If energy is transferred
efficiently to the surface, like e.g. in the presence of convective
instabilities, this burst could contribute to revitalize a partially failed SN
explosion. We discuss how the neutrino observations from SN1987A would fit in
this scenario. Finally, we focus on the fate of massive and rapidly rotating
progenitors, discussing possible time separations between the moment of the
core collapse and the moment of quark deconfinement. This mechanism can be at
the basis of the interpretation of gamma ray bursts in which lines associated
with heavy elements are present in the spectrum.

social choice and threshold logic. In this paper, the complexity of comparison
of influence between players in coalitional voting games is characterized. The
possible representations of simple games considered are simple games
represented by winning coalitions, minimal winning coalitions, weighted voting
game or a multiple weighted voting game. The influence of players is gauged
from the viewpoint of basic player types, desirability relations and classical
power indices such as Shapley-Shubik index, Banzhaf index, Holler index,
Deegan-Packel index and Chow parameters. Among other results, it is shown that
for a simple game represented by minimal winning coalitions, although it is
easy to verify whether a player has zero or one voting power, computing the
Banzhaf value of the player is #P-complete. Moreover, it is proved that
multiple weighted voting games are the only representations for which it is
NP-hard to verify whether the game is linear or not. For a simple game with a
set W^m of minimal winning coalitions and n players, a O(n.|W^m|+(n^2)log(n))
algorithm is presented which returns `no' if the game is non-linear and returns
the strict desirability ordering otherwise. The complexity of transforming
simple games into compact representations is also examined.

Kolesik, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, L117 (2002)], for which both nucleation and
interface propagation are slower and the interfaces smoother than for the
standard Glauber dynamic. We choose the temperature and magnitude of the
external field such that the metastable decay of the system following field
reversal occurs through nucleation and growth of many droplets of the stable
phase, i.e., the multidroplet regime. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we
find that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition, in which the
symmetry-broken dynamic phase corresponds to an asymmetric stationary limit
cycle for the time-dependent magnetization. The critical point is located where
the half-period of the external field is approximately equal to the metastable
lifetime of the system. We employ finite-size scaling analysis to investigate
the characteristics of this dynamical phase transition. The critical exponents
and the fixed-point value of the fourth-order cumulant are found to be
consistent with the universality class of the two-dimensional equilibrium Ising
model. As this universality class has previously been established for the same
nonequilibrium model evolving under the standard Glauber dynamic, our results
indicate that this far-from-equilibrium phase transition is universal with
respect to the choice of the stochastic dynamics.

cause elastic deformation of the porous matrix. The reversible formation of an
adsorbed film, which precedes capillary condensation, results in an extension
of the porous material while, in the hysteresis region, the negative liquid
pressures under the concave menisci contract the porous matrix. The elastic
deformation exhibits an hysteresis loop in the same pressure region as the
adsorption phenomenon. These deformations have been neglected in practically
all the theoretical treatments of adsorption. We develop a thermodynamic
approach which includes the elastic energy of the solid. This approach is
generic to all porous materials. Thermodynamics of adsorption is directly
connected to the elastic properties of the porous solid. We find that the
variation of the surface free energy related to the elastic deformation is an
important component of the total free energy. It is shown that the condensation
branch represents the more stable states and that an energy barrier exists to
evaporation which depends essentially on the elastic deformation. The pores
interact through the deformation of the walls. Based on this interaction
mechanism and on the shape of the scanning curves which are common to materials
with interconnected pores such as porous glass or noninterconnected pores such
as p+-type porous silicon and SBA-15, we propose a scenario for the filling and

neutrinos, the oscillations of which must take place within a few
mean-free-paths of their resonance surface located nearby their neutrinosphere.
The state-of-the-art on the SN dynamics suggests that a significant part of
these $\nu_e$ can convert into right-handed neutrinos in virtue of the
interaction of the electrons and the protons flowing with the SN outgoing
plasma, whenever the Dirac neutrino magnetic moment be of strength $\mu_\nu <
10^{-11} \mu_{\rm B}$, with $\mu_{\rm B}$ being the Bohr magneton. In the
supernova envelope, part of these neutrinos can flip back to the left-handed
flavors due to the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the
magnetic field in the SN expanding plasma (Kuznetsov & Mikheev 2007; Kuznetsov,
Mikheev & Okrugin 2008), a region where the field strength is currently
accepted to be $B \gtrsim 10^{13}$ ~G. This type of $\nu$ oscillations were
shown to generate powerful gravitational wave (GW) bursts (Mosquera Cuesta
2000, Mosquera Cuesta 2002, Mosquera Cuesta & Fiuza 2004, Loveridge 2004). If
such double spin-flip mechanism does run into action inside the SN core, then
the release of both the oscillation-produced $\nu_\mu$s, $\nu_\tau$s and the GW
pulse generated by the coherent $\nu$ spin-flips provides a unique emission
offset $\Delta T^{emission}_{\rm GW} \leftrightarrow \nu = 0$ for measuring the
$\nu$ travel time to Earth. As massive $\nu$s get noticeably delayed on its
journey to Earth with respect to the Einstein GW they generated during the
reconversion transient, then the accurate measurement of this time-of-flight
delay by SNEWS + LIGO, VIRGO, BBO, DECIGO, etc., might readily assess the
absolute $\nu$ mass spectrum.

target mRNAs to regulate protein expression. We use a quantitative approach to
compare and contrast sRNAs with conventional transcription factors (TFs) to
better understand the advantages of each form of regulation. In particular, we
calculate the steady-state behavior, noise properties, frequency-dependent gain
(amplification), and dynamical response to large input signals of both forms of
regulation. While the mean steady-state behavior of sRNA-regulated proteins
exhibits a distinctive tunable threshold-linear behavior, our analysis shows
that transcriptional bursting leads to significantly higher intrinsic noise in
sRNA-based regulation than in TF-based regulation in a large range of
expression levels and limits the ability of sRNAs to perform quantitative
signaling. Nonetheless, we find that sRNAs are better than TFs at filtering
noise in input signals. Additionally, we find that sRNAs allow cells to respond
rapidly to large changes in input signals. These features suggest a niche for
sRNAs in allowing cells to transition quickly yet reliably between distinct
states. This functional niche is consistent with the widespread appearance of
sRNAs in stress-response and quasi-developmental networks in prokaryotes.

relation that depends only on the symmetries of a FLRW spacetime, but does not
intrinsically make any dynamical assumptions. This suggests that it should be
possible to estimate the parameters defining the Hubble relation without making
any dynamical assumptions. To test this idea, we perform a number of
inter-related cosmographic fits to the legacy05 and gold06 supernova datasets.
Based on this supernova data, the ""preponderance of evidence"" certainly
suggests an accelerating universe. However we would argue that (unless one uses
additional dynamical and observational information) this conclusion is not
currently supported ""beyond reasonable doubt"". As part of the analysis we
develop two particularly transparent graphical representations of the
redshift-distance relation -- representations in which acceleration versus
deceleration reduces to the question of whether the relevant graph slopes up or
down. Turning to the details of the cosmographic fits, three issues in
particular concern us: First, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter
changes significantly depending on whether one performs a chi^2 fit to the
luminosity distance, proper motion distance or other suitable distance
surrogate. Second, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes
significantly depending on whether one uses the traditional redshift variable
z, or what we shall argue is on theoretical grounds an improved
parameterization y=z/(1+z). Third, the published estimates for systematic
uncertainties are sufficiently large that they certainly impact on, and to a
large extent undermine, the usual purely statistical tests of significance. We
conclude that the supernova data should be treated with some caution.

for reverse-link Direct Sequence (DS)- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).
Assuming perfect estimates of the channel and interference covariance, the
receiver selects the signature that minimizes interference power or maximizes
signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for a desired user from a
signature codebook. The codebook index corresponding to the optimal signature
is then relayed to the user with a finite number of bits via a feedback
channel. Here we are interested in the performance of a Random Vector
Quantization (RVQ) codebook, which contains independent isotropically
distributed vectors. Assuming arbitrary transmit power allocation, we consider
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel first with no fading and
subsequently, with multipath fading. We derive the corresponding SINR in a
large system limit at the output of matched filter and linear minimum mean
squared error (MMSE) receiver. Numerical examples show that the derived large
system results give a good approximation to the performance of finite-size
system and that the MMSE receiver achieves close to a single-user performance
with only one feedback bit per signature element.

nuclear matter is studied with the help of an in-medium modified four nucleon
equation. It is found that at very low density quartetting wins over pairing,
because of the strong binding of the alpha-particles. The critical temperature
can reach values up to around 6 MeV. Also the disappearance of alpha-particles
with increasing density, i.e. the Mott transition, is investigated. In finite
nuclei the Hoyle state, that is the 0_2^+ of 12C, is identified as an
""alpha-particle condensate"" state. It is conjectured that such states also
exist in heavier n alpha-nuclei, like 16O, 20Ne, etc. For instance the 6-th 0^+
state of 16O at 15.1 MeV is identified from a theoretical analysis as being a
strong candidate for an alpha condensate state. Exploratory calculations are
performed for the density dependence of the alpha condensate fraction at zero
temperature to address the suppression of the four-particle condensate below
nuclear-matter density. Possible quartet condensation in other systems is

obtained by gauging SO(1,1) symmetry of the real symmetric scalar manifold (in
particular a generic Jordan family manifold of the vector multiplets)
simultaneously with a subgroup R_s of the R-symmetry group descend to four
dimensional de Sitter ground states under certain conditions. First, the
holomorphic section in four dimensions has to be chosen carefully by using the
symplectic freedom in four dimensions; and second, a group contraction is
necessary to bring the potential into a desired form. Under these conditions,
stable de Sitter vacua can be obtained in dimensionally reduced theories (from
5D to 4D) if the semi-direct product of SO(1,1) with R^(1,1) together with a
simultaneous R_s is gauged. We review the stable de Sitter vacua in four
dimensions found in earlier literature for N=2 Yang-Mills Einstein supergravity
with SO(2,1) x R_s gauge group in a symplectic basis that comes naturally after
dimensional reduction. Although this particular gauge group does not descend
directly from five dimensions, we show that, its contraction does. Hence, two
different theories overlap in certain limits. Examples of stable de Sitter
vacua are given for the cases: (i) R_s=U(1)_R, (ii) R_s=SU(2)_R, (iii) N=2

estimate basic quantities about dust: dust temperature, dust mass, and total
FIR luminosity. We find that the typical dust temperature of the BCD sample is
systematically higher than that of normal spiral galaxies, although there is a
large variety. The interstellar radiation field estimated from the dust
temperature ranges up to 100 times of the Galactic value. This confirms the
concentrated star-forming activity in BCDs. The star formation rate can be
evaluated from the FIR luminosity as 0.01--0.5 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Combining
this quantity with gas mass taken from the literature, we estimate the gas
consumption timescales (gas mass divided by the star formation rate), which
prove to span a wide range from 1 Gyr to 100 Gyr. A natural interpretation of
this large variety can be provided by intermittent star formation activity. We
finally show the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity (we utilize
our estimate of dust mass, and take other necessary quantities from the
literature). There is a positive correlation between dust-to-gas ratio and
metallicity as expected from chemical evolution models.

(Brown et al., 2007) is surprising because the formation of such a family is a
highly improbable event in today's belt. Assuming Brown et al.'s estimate of
the size of progenitors, we find that the probability that a Kuiper belt object
was involved in such a collision since primordial times is less than roughly
0.001. In addition, it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a
massive primordial Kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family
would not have survived whatever event produced the currently observed orbital
excitation. Here we suggest that the family is the result of a collision
between two scattered disk objects. We show that the probability that a
collision occurred between two such objects with sizes similar to those
advocated in Brown et al. (2007) and that the center of mass of the resulting
family is on an orbit typical of the Kuiper belt can be as large as 47%. Given
the large uncertainties involved in this estimate, this result is consistent
with the existence of one such family. If true, this result has implications
far beyond the origin of a single collisional family, because it shows that
collisions played an important role in shaping the dynamical structure of the
small body populations that we see today.

studies of the electronic properties of quasi-two-dimensional low-temperature
superconductor CuS (covellite) in the temperature region between 1.47 and 290
K. Two NQR signals corresponding to two non-equivalent sites of copper in the
structure, Cu(1) and Cu(2), has been found. The temperature dependences of
copper quadrupole frequencies, line-widths and spin-lattice relaxation rates,
which so far had never been investigated so precisely for this material,
altogether demonstrate the structural phase transition near 55 K, which
accompanies transformations of electronic spectrum not typical for simple
metals. The analysis of NQR results and their comparison with literature data
show that the valence of copper ions at both sites is intermediate in character
between monovalent and divalent states with the dominant of the former. It has
been found that there is a strong hybridization of Cu(1) and Cu(2) conduction
bands at low temperatures, indicating that the charge delocalization between
these ions takes place even in 2D regime. Based on our data, the occurrence of
energy gap, charge fluctuations and charge-density waves, as well as the nature
of phase transition in CuS are discussed. It is concluded that some physical
properties of CuS are similar to those of high-temperature superconductors
(HTSC) in normal state.

the doping dependence of the CuO2 plane electronic structure. But such models
are manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconducting
critical temperature Tc among cuprates which have identical hole-density but
are crystallographically different outside the CuO2 plane. A key challenge,
therefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influence
controlling the superconductivity - with much attention focusing on the
distance $d_A$ between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. Here we
report direct determination of how variations of inter-atomic distances within
individual crystalline unit cells, affect the superconducting energy-gap
maximum $\Delta$ of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. In this material, quasi-periodic variations
of unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline
'supermodulation'. Within each supermodulation period, we find a $\sim 9\pm1%$
co-sinusoidal variation in local $\Delta$ that is anti-correlated with the
associated $d_A$ variations. Furthermore, we show that phenomenological
consistency would exist between these effects and the random $\Delta$
variations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitial
dopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish $d_A$ or tilt
the CuO5 pyramid. Thus we reveal a strong non-random out-of-plane effect on
cuprate superconductivity at atomic scale.

established the existence of a substantial number (~40) of Galactic TeV
gamma-ray sources, a large fraction of which remain unidentified. HESS
J0632+057 is one of a small fraction of these objects which is point-like in
nature(<2' rms), and is one of only two point-like sources that remain
unidentified. Follow-up observations of this object with XMM-Newton have
revealed an X-ray source coincident with the TeV source and with the massive
star MWC 148, of the spectral type B0pe. This source exhibits a hard spectrum,
consistent with an absorbed power law with Gamma = 1.26 +/- 0.04, and shows
significant variability on hour timescales. We discuss this spatial coincidence
and the implied spectral energy distribution of this object and argue that it
is likely a new gamma-ray binary system with a close resemblance to the three
known members of this class, and in particular to LS I +61 303. Further X-ray,

HESS J0632+057 as a new member of this rare class of Galactic objects.

X-ray, we divided our fields of view into 33 box regions. The spectra are well
fitted by a two-component nonequilibrium ionization model. The emission measure
distributions of heavy elements decrease from the inner region to the outer
region of the Loop. Then, we also divided our fields of view into 26 annular

obtained, it is consistent with that the X-ray emission is the Cygnus Loop
origin and we concluded that high-$kT_{e}$ component ($\sim$0.4 keV) originates
from the ejecta while low-$kT_{e}$ component ($\sim$0.2 keV) is derived from
the swept-up interstellar medium. The flux of low-$kT_{e}$ component is much
less than that of high-$kT_{e}$ component, suggesting the ISM component is very

way, models defined over small-world networks. Even if the exactness of the
method is limited to the paramagnetic regions and to some special limits, it
provides, yielding a clear and immediate (also in terms of calculation)
physical insight, the exact critical behavior and the exact critical surfaces
and percolation thresholds. The underlying structure of the non random part of
the model, i.e., the set of spins filling up a given lattice L_0 of dimension
d_0 and interacting through a fixed coupling J_0, is exactly taken into
account. When J_0\geq 0, the small-world effect gives rise, as is known, to a
second-order phase transition that takes place independently of the dimension
d_0 and of the added random connectivity c. When J_0<0, a different and novel
scenario emerges in which, besides a spin glass transition, multiple first- and
second-order phase transitions may take place. As immediate analytical
applications we analyze the Viana-Bray model (d_0=0), the one dimensional chain
(d_0=1), and the spherical model for arbitrary d_0.

approximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range
[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. Nevertheless, no model can be

initial conditions for the inflaton allow for kinetic energies of the same
order of the potential energies and nonperturbative inflaton modes with nonzero
wavenumbers. Their evolution starts with a transitory epoch where the redshift
due to the expansion succeeds to assemble the quantum excited modes of the
inflaton in a homogeneous (zero mode) condensate, and the large value of the
Hubble parameter succeeds to overdamp the fast-roll of the redshifted inflaton
modes. After this transitory stage the effective classical slow-roll epoch is
reached. Most of the efolds are produced during the slow-roll epoch and we
recover the classical slow-roll results for the scalar and tensor metric
perturbations plus corrections. These corrections are important, both for
scalar and for tensor perturbations, if scales which are horizon-size today
exited the horizon by the end of the transitory stage and as a consequence the
lower CMB multipoles get suppressed (fast-roll) or enhanced (precondensate).
These two types of corrections can compete and combine in a scale dependent
manner. They arise as natural consequences of the quantum nonperturbative
inflaton dynamics, and provide a consistent and contrastable model for the
origin of the suppression of the quadrupole and for other departures of the low

Yang-Mills theories due to quantum gravitational effects in a compact large
extra dimensional brane world scenario with a low energy quantum gravity scale.
The ADD scenario is applied for a D=d+\delta dimensional space-time in which
gravitons freely propagate, whereas the non-abelian gauge fields are confined
to a d-dimensional brane. The extra dimensions are taken to be toroidal and the
transverse fluctuation modes (branons) of the brane are taken into account. On
this basis we have calculated the one-loop corrections due to virtual
Kaluza-Klein graviton and branon modes for the gluon two- and three-point
functions in an effective field theory treatment. Applying momentum cut-off
regularization we find that for a d=4 brane the leading gravitational
divergencies cancel irrespective of the number of extra dimensions \delta,
generalizing previous results in the absence of extra-dimensions. Hence, again
the Yang-Mills \beta-function receives no gravitational corrections at
one-loop. This is no longer true in a `universal' extra dimensional scenario
with a d>4 dimensional brane. Moreover, the subleading power-law gravitational
divergencies induce higher-dimensional counterterms, which we establish in our
scheme. Interestingly, for d=4 these gravitationally induced counterterms are
of the form recently considered in non-abelian Lee-Wick extensions of the
standard model -- now with a possible mass scale in the TeV range due to the
presence of large extra dimensions.

characteristic times of a few days; others evolve on thousands of years. All
these structures are interdependent; in other words, they communicate. It is
often considered that the only way to cope with climate complexity is to
integrate the equations of atmospheric and oceanic motion with the finer
possible mesh. Is this the sole strategy? Aren't we missing another
characteristic of the climate system: its ability to destroy and generate
information at the macroscopic scale? Paleoclimatologists consider that much of
this information is present in palaeoclimate archives. It is therefore natural
to build climate models such as to get the most of these archives. The strategy
proposed here is based on Bayesian statistics and low-order non-linear
dynamical systems, in a modelling approach that explicitly includes the effects
of uncertainties. Its practical interest is illustrated through the problem of
the timing of the next great glaciation. Is glacial inception overdue, or do we
need to wait for another 50,000 years before ice caps grow again? Our results
indicate a glaciation inception in 50,000 years.

  Bioinformatics""",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The binding of a ligand molecule to a protein is often accompanied by
conformational changes of the protein. A central question is whether the ligand
induces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and
stabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of
ground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the
binding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In
this model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand.
The first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is
off, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound.
The induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground
state, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state.
We find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in
the two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is
fast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the
conformational equilibrium constant, while the off-rate is independent. In the
case of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the
conformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein
binds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by
mutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other ""perturbations"" that
only affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such
mutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only
the off-rate.

in several perovskite rare-earth manganites, including the multiferroics TbMnO3
and DyMnO3. We demonstrate that the strong magnetocapacitive effects, observed
for electrical fields E||c, are nearly completely governed by magnetic-state
induced changes of the relaxation parameters. The multiferroic materials, which
undergo a transition into a spiral magnetic state, show qualitatively different
relaxation behavior than those compounds transferring into an A-type
antiferromagnetic state. We ascribe the relaxations in both cases to the
off-center motion of the manganese ions, which in the multiferroic systems also
leads to the ferroelectric ordering.

Orion Nebula cluster could be responsible for the loss of at least half of its
initial content of OB stars. This result suggests that other young stellar
systems could also lose a significant fraction of their massive stars at the
very beginning of their evolution. To confirm this expectation, we used the
Mid-Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (completed by the Midcourse Space Experiment
satellite) to search for bow shocks around a number of young ($\la$ several
Myr) clusters and OB associations. We discovered dozens of bow shocks generated
by OB stars running away from these stellar systems, supporting the idea of
significant dynamical loss of OB stars. In this paper, we report the discovery
of three bow shocks produced by O-type stars ejected from the open cluster
NGC6611 (M16). One of the bow shocks is associated with the O9.5Iab star
HD165319, which was suggested to be one of ""the best examples for isolated
Galactic high-mass star formation"" (de Wit et al. 2005, A&A, 437, 247).
Possible implications of our results for the origin of field OB stars are
discussed.

smooth affine surfaces up to conjugation in the full automorphism group and up
to inversion of C*. If a smooth affine surface V admits more than one C*-action
then it is known to be Gizatullin i.e., it can be completed by a linear chain
of smooth rational curves. In our previous paper we gave a sufficient
condition, in terms of the Dolgachev- Pinkham-Demazure (or DPD) presentation,
for the uniqueness of a C*-action on a Gizatullin surface. In the present paper
we show that this condition is also necessary, at least in the smooth case. In
fact, if the uniqueness fails for a smooth Gizatullin surface V which is
neither toric nor Danilov-Gizatullin, then V admits a continuous family of
pairwise non-conjugated C*-actions depending on one or two parameters. We give
an explicit description of all such surfaces and their C*-actions in terms of
DPD presentations. We also show that for every k > 0 one can find a Danilov-
Gizatullin surface V (n) of index n = n(k) with a family of pairwise
non-conjugate C+-actions depending on k parameters.

display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the
discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However,
it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models,
or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex
intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we
investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons,
such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This
model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS),
regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the
oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks
using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with
surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show
that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust
emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we
investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks
with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is
reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical
networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but
with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state
transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or
anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by
two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic
properties such as LTS are crucial for AI states in thalamocortical networks.
