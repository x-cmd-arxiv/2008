field theories, with special emphasis on those CFTs that are dual to type IIB
string theory on AdS3xS3xX4. The chiral primary operators are sections of
vector bundles, whose connection describes the operator mixing under motion on
the moduli space. This connection can be exactly computed using the constraints
from N = (4,4) supersymmetry. Its curvature can be determined using the tt*
equations, for which we give a derivation in the physical theory which does not
rely on the topological twisting. We show that for N = (4,4) theories the
chiral ring is covariantly constant over the moduli space, a fact which can be
seen as a non-renormalization theorem for the three-point functions of chiral
primaries in AdS3/CFT2. From the spacetime point of view our analysis has the
following applications. First, in the case of a D1/D5 black string, we can see
the matching of the attractor flow in supergravity to RG-flow in the boundary
field theory perturbed by irrelevant operators, to first order away from the
fixed point. Second, under spectral flow the chiral primaries become the Ramond
ground states of the CFT. These ground states represent the microstates of a
small black hole in five dimensions consisting of a D1/D5 bound state. The
connection that we compute can be considered as an example of Berry's phase for
the internal microstates of a supersymmetric black hole.

dust-enshrouded, with extremely red mid-infrared (MIR) colors and relatively
low luminosities. The transients were optically faint (-13 < M_V < -15)
compared to normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe), and their spectra exhibited
narrow emission lines. These events are unique among transient-progenitor pairs
and hence constitute a new class. Whether they are true SNe or bright
massive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the SN rate. This
fact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction of
all massive stars have the MIR colors of the SN 2008S and NGC300 progenitors,
as we show using MIR and optical luminosity, color, and variability properties
of massive stars in M33. We find that the fraction of massive stars with colors
consistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. In fact, only < 10 similar
objects exist in M33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the AGB
sequence. That these transients are relatively common with respect to SNe,
while their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population,
implies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives of
many massive stars. This shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yr
before explosion, be it death or merely eruption. We discuss the implications
of this finding for the evolution and census of ``low-mass'' massive stars
(8-12 Msun), and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron-capture
SNe and the explosive birth of white dwarfs. A systematic census with (warm)
Spitzer of galaxies in the local universe for analogous progenitors would
significantly improve our knowledge of this channel to massive stellar
explosions, and potentially to others with obscured progenitors. (Abridged)

provide a complementary probe of dark energy by allowing the measurement of
cosmic expansion history that extends to redshifts greater than 6. Unlike Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), GRBs must be calibrated for each cosmological model
considered, because of the lack of a nearby sample of GRBs for
model-independent calibration. For a flat Universe with a cosmological

the current GRB data can be summarized by a set of model-independent distance

unexpected Rouse-like scaling of the mean squared displacement (MSD) r^2(t) ~
t^(1/2) at intermediate times, corresponding to fluctuations at length scales
larger than the persistence length but smaller than the coil size; another
study claimed the more conventional Zimm scaling r^2(t) ~ t^(2/3) in the same

local exponent of the end-monomer MSD, alpha(t) = d log r^2(t)/ d log t, drops
below the Zimm value of 2/3 for sufficiently long chains. The deviation from
the Zimm prediction increases with chain length, though it does not reach the
Rouse limit of 1/2. The qualitative features of this intermediate regime, in
particular the variation of alpha(t) with chain and persistence lengths, can be
reproduced through a heuristic scaling argument. Anomalously low values of the

slow crossover from dynamics on length scales smaller than the persistence

computed in general relativistic gravity, assuming a conformally flat spatial
geometry (Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews formulation) and a polytropic equation of
state. Highly deformed solutions are calculated on the initial slice covered by
spherical coordinate grids, centered at the source, in all angular directions
up to a large truncation radius. Constant rest mass sequences are calculated
from nearly axisymmetric to maximally deformed triaxial configurations.
Selected parameters are to model (proto-) neutron stars; the compactness is M/R
= 0.001, 0.1, 0.14, 0.2 for polytropic index n = 0.3 and M/R = 0.001, 0.1,
0.12, 0.14 for n = 0.5. We confirmed that the triaxial solutions exist for
these parameters as in the case of Newtonian polytropes. However, it is also
found that the triaxial sequences become shorter for higher compactness, and
those may disappear at a certain large compactness for the n = 0.5 case. In the
scenario of the contraction of proto-neutron stars being subject to strong
viscosity and rapid cooling, it is plausible that, once the viscosity driven
secular instability sets in during the contraction, the proto-neutron stars are
always maximally deformed triaxial configurations, as long as the compactness
and the equation of state parameters allow such triaxial sequences. Detection
of gravitational waves from such sources may be used as another probe for the
nuclear equation of state.

We argue that it is possible to accurately compute a wavefield by decomposing
it onto a largely incomplete set of eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator,
chosen at random, and that this provides a natural way of parallelizing wave
simulations for memory-intensive applications.
  This paper shows that L1-Helmholtz recovery makes sense for wave computation,
and identifies a regime in which it is provably effective: the one-dimensional
wave equation with coefficients of small bounded variation. Under suitable
assumptions we show that the number of eigenfunctions needed to evolve a sparse
wavefield defined on N points, accurately with very high probability, is
bounded by C log(N) log(log(N)), where C is related to the desired accuracy and
can be made to grow at a much slower rate than N when the solution is sparse.
The PDE estimates that underlie this result are new to the authors' knowledge
and may be of independent mathematical interest; they include an L1 estimate
for the wave equation, an estimate of extension of eigenfunctions, and a bound
for eigenvalue gaps in Sturm-Liouville problems.
  Numerical examples are presented in one spatial dimension and show that as
few as 10 percents of all eigenfunctions can suffice for accurate results.
Finally, we argue that the compressive viewpoint suggests a competitive
parallel algorithm for an adjoint-state inversion method in reflection
seismology.

naturally extends the space of Random Overlap Structures as defined by
Aizenman, Sims and Starr. We discuss the Ruelle Probability Cascades and the
stochastic stability within this framework. As an application, we use an idea

relativistic lagrangian field theories exhibiting static spherically symmetric
non-topological soliton solutions. The analysis is concerned with (multi-)
scalar fields and generalized gauge fields of compact semi-simple Lie groups.
The lagrangian densities governing the dynamics of the (multi-) scalar fields
are assumed to be general functions of the kinetic terms, whereas the
gauge-invariant lagrangians are general functions of the field invariants.
These functions are constrained by requirements of regularity, positivity of
the energy and vanishing of the vacuum energy, defining what we call
""admissible"" models. In the scalar case we establish the general conditions
which determine exhaustively the families of admissible lagrangian models
supporting this kind of finite-energy solutions. We analyze some explicit
examples of these different families, which are defined by the asymptotic and
central behaviour of the fields of the corresponding particle-like solutions.
  From the variational analysis of the energy functional, we show that the
admissibility constraints and the finiteness of the energy of the scalar
solitons are necessary and sufficient conditions for their linear static
stability against small charge-preserving perturbations. Furthermore we perform
a general spectral analysis of the dynamic evolution of the small perturbations
around the statically stable solitons, establishing their dynamic stability.
Next, we consider the case of many-components scalar fields, showing that the
resolution of the particle-like field problem in this case reduces to that of
the one-component case. The study of these scalar models is a necessary step in
the analysis of the gauge fields.

various GW emission processes in particular supernova explosion scenarios and
argue that the GW signatures of neutrino-driven, magneto-rotational, and

in metallicity. If GCs are bimodal in metallicity this relation is consistent
with recent suggestions of a mass-metallicity relation only for metal-poor

accounting for incompleteness and the Eddington bias, we compute the V-band
local GC specific frequency (Sn) and specific luminosity (Sl) of each galaxy.
We show that Sl is the more robust measure of the richness of a GC population

arcmin (56 pc), consistent with previous estimates. Follow-up spectroscopy
obtained with the Gemini/GMOS instrument yielded radial velocities and
metallicities. While the majority of our targets covers a broad range in
velocities and metallicities, we find five stars which share very similar
velocities and metallicities and which are all compatible with the colors and
magnitudes of the galaxy's likely red giant branch. We interpret these as a
spectroscopic detection of the Bootes II system. These stars have a mean
velocity of -117 km/s, a velocity dispersion of (10.5+-7.4) km/s and a mean
[Fe/H] of -1.79 dex, with a dispersion of 0.14 dex. At this metallicity, Boo II
is not consistent with the stellar-mass-metallicity relation for the more
luminous dwarf galaxies. Coupled with our distance estimate, its high negative
systemic velocity rules out any physical connection with its projected
neighbor, the Bootes I dwarf spheroidal, which has a velocity of ~+100 km/s.
The velocity and distance of Bootes II coincide with those of the leading arm
of Sagittarius, which passes through this region of the sky, so that it is
possible that Bootes II may be a stellar system associated with the Sagittarius
stream. Finally, we note that the properties of Bootes II are consistent with
being the surviving remnant of a previously larger and more luminous dSph
galaxy.

theory, we then expand the grand-canonical free energy as a double power series

excitation spectra in the ordered phase are found by considering both
longitudinal and transverse variations of the order parameter. Finally, these
results are applied to the concrete case of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a
three dimensional cubic lattice, and compared with the corresponding results
from mean-field theory. Although both approaches yield the same Mott insulator

La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO(4), along with low-field susceptibility, thermal
conductivity, and specific heat data. We compare these with previously reported
results for resistivity and thermopower. Temperature-dependent features
indicating transitions (or crossovers) are correlated among the various
experimental quantities. Taking into account recent spectroscopic studies, we
argue that the most likely interpretation of the complete collection of results
is that an unusual form of two-dimensional superconducting correlations appears
together with the onset of spin-stripe order. Recent theoretical proposals for
a sinusoidally-modulated superconducting state compatible with stripe order
provide an intriguing explanation of our results and motivate further
experimental tests. We also discuss evidence for one-dimensional pairing
correlations that appear together with the charge order. With regard to the
overall phenomenology, we consider the degree to which similar behavior may
have been observed in other cuprates, and describe possible connections to
various puzzling phenomena in cuprate superconductors.

operators of the general form $\int_{\R^d} e^{2\pi\i \Phi(x,k)} f(k) d k$,
where $k$ is a frequency variable, $\Phi(x,k)$ is a phase function obeying a
standard homogeneity condition, and $f$ is a given input. This is of interest
for such fundamental computations are connected with the problem of finding
numerical solutions to wave equations, and also frequently arise in many
applications including reflection seismology, curvilinear tomography and
others. In two dimensions, when the input and output are sampled on $N \times
N$ Cartesian grids, a direct evaluation requires $O(N^4)$ operations, which is
often times prohibitively expensive.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm running in $O(N^2 \log N)$ time, i.
e. with near-optimal computational complexity, and whose overall structure
follows that of the butterfly algorithm [Michielssen and Boag, IEEE Trans
Antennas Propagat 44 (1996), 1086-1093]. Underlying this algorithm is a
mathematical insight concerning the restriction of the kernel $e^{2\pi\i
\Phi(x,k)}$ to subsets of the time and frequency domains. Whenever these
subsets obey a simple geometric condition, the restricted kernel has
approximately low-rank; we propose constructing such low-rank approximations
using a special interpolation scheme, which prefactors the oscillatory
component, interpolates the remaining nonoscillatory part and, lastly,
remodulates the outcome. A byproduct of this scheme is that the whole algorithm
is highly efficient in terms of memory requirement. Numerical results
demonstrate the performance and illustrate the empirical properties of this
algorithm.

exploitation of such a load margin is optimized by shaping the spectrum of the

substantial difference between `cleavage' and `exfoliation' of graphite and

obeys a $C_3 \log(D/D_0) D^{-3}$ law for graphitics and a $C_{5/2} D^{-5/2}$

assumed more trival differences. Furthermore we gather further insight into the
effect of scale on the vdW power laws of systems that simultaneously exhibit
macroscopic and nanoscopic dimensions. We show that, for metallic and graphitic

near standard power laws when the effective scale of one or more dimension is
changed. This allows better identification of the systems for which the

$N_-(\alpha)=O(\alpha^p)$ for any given $p\ge 1/2$. For a special class of
trees we show that these conditions are not only sufficient but also necessary.
For $p>1/2$ the order-sharp estimates involve a (quasi-)norm of $V$ in some
`weak' $L_p$- or $\ell_p(L_1)$-space. We show that the results can be easily
derived from the ones of an earlier paper by Naimark and the author, Proc.

lensed high redshift quasar APM 08279+5255 (z=3.911) with the Very Large Array
at 0.3"" resolution. The CO(J=1-0) emission is clearly resolved in our maps. The
CO(J=1-0) line luminosity derived from these maps is in good agreement with a
previous single-dish measurement. In contrast to previous interferometer-based
studies, we find that the full molecular gas reservoir is situated in two
compact peaks separated by <~0.4"". Our observations reveal, for the first time,
that the emission from cold molecular gas is virtually cospatial with the
optical/near-infrared continuum emission of the central AGN in this source.
This striking similarity in morphology indicates that the molecular gas is
situated in a compact region close to the AGN. Based on the high resolution CO
maps, we present a revised model for the gravitational lensing in this system,
which indicates that the molecular gas emission is magnified by only a factor
of 4 (in contrast to previously suggested factors of 100). This model suggests
that the CO is situated in a circumnuclear disk of ~550 pc radius that is
possibly seen at an inclination of <~25 deg, i.e., relatively close to face-on.
  From the CO luminosity, we derive a molecular gas mass of M_gas=1.3x10^11
M_sun for this galaxy. From the CO structure and linewidth, we derive a
dynamical mass of M_dyn(sin i)^2=4.0x10^10 M_sun. Based on a revised mass
estimate for the central black hole of M_BH=2.3x10^10 M_sun and the results of
our molecular line study, we find that the mass of the stellar bulge of APM
08279+5255 falls short of the local M_BH-sigma_bulge relationship of nearby
galaxies by more than an order of magnitude, lending support to recent
suggestions that this relation may evolve with cosmic time and/or change toward
the high mass end.

position with the pendulum's bob above the pivot rather than below it. This
surprising and counterintuitive phenomenon is a widespread feature of driven
systems and carries over into the quantum world. Even when the static
properties of a quantum system are known, its response to an explicitly
time-dependent variation of its parameters may be highly nontrivial, and
qualitatively new states can appear that were absent in the original system. In
quantum mechanics the archetype for this kind of behaviour is an atom in a
radiation field, which exhibits a number of fundamental phenomena such as the
modification of its g-factor in a radio-frequency field and the dipole force
acting on an atom moving in a spatially varying light field. These effects can
be successfully described in the so-called dressed atom picture. Here we show
that the concept of dressing can also be applied to macroscopic matter waves,
and that the quantum states of ""dressed matter waves"" can be coherently
controlled. In our experiments we use Bose-Einstein condensates in driven
optical lattices and demonstrate that the many-body state of this system can be
adiabatically and reversibly changed between a superfluid and a Mott insulating
state by varying the amplitude of the driving. Our setup represents a versatile
testing ground for driven quantum systems, and our results indicate the
direction towards new quantum control schemes for matter waves.

evolution of unconventional superconductivity in antiferromagnetic (AFM)
CeNiGe$_3$. The measurements of the $^{73}$Ge-NQR spectrum and the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) have revealed that the unconventional
superconductivity evolves inside a commensurate AFM phase around the pressure
($P$) where N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$ exhibits its maximum at 8.5 K. The
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm SC}$ has been found to be
enhanced with increasing $T_{\rm N}$, before reaching the quantum critical
point at which the AFM order collapses. Above $T_{\rm SC}$, the AFM structure
transits from an incommensurate spin-density-wave order to a commensurate AFM
order at $T\sim 2$ K, accompanied by a longitudinal spin-density fluctuation.
With regard to heavy-fermion compounds, these novel phenomena have hitherto
never been reported in the $P$-$T$ phase diagram.

for modelling many cellular processes, specific situations demand stochastic
models to capture the influence of noise. The most common formulation of
stochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation
(CME). While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realise the CME,
analytical approximations offer more insight into the influence of noise.
Towards that end, the two-moment approximation (2MA) is a promising addition to
the established analytical approaches including the chemical Langevin equation
(CLE) and the related linear noise approximation (LNA). The 2MA approach
directly tracks the mean and (co)variance which are coupled in general. This
coupling is not obvious in CME and CLE and ignored by LNA and conventional ODE
models. We extend previous derivations of 2MA by allowing a) non-elementary
reactions and b) relative concentrations. Often, several elementary reactions
are approximated by a single step. Furthermore, practical situations often
require the use relative concentrations. We investigate the applicability of
the 2MA approach to the well established fission yeast cell cycle model. Our
analytical model reproduces the clustering of cycle times observed in
experiments. This is explained through multiple resettings of MPF, caused by
the coupling between mean and (co)variance, near the G2/M transition.

primarily on the role played by H2 cooling, on account of its large chemical
abundance relative to other possible molecular or ionic coolants. However,
while H2 is generally the most important coolant at low gas densities, it is
not an effective coolant at high gas densities, owing to the low critical
density at which it reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and to the
large opacities that develop in its emission lines. It is therefore possible
that emission from other chemical species may play an important role in cooling
high density primordial gas. A particularly interesting candidate is the H3+
molecular ion. This ion has an LTE cooling rate that is roughly a billion times
larger than that of H2, and unlike other primordial molecular ions such as H2+
or HeH+, it is not easily removed from the gas by collisions with H or H2. It
is already known to be an important coolant in at least one astrophysical
context -- the upper atmospheres of gas giants -- but its role in the cooling
of primordial gas has received little previous study. In this paper, we
investigate the potential importance of H3+ cooling in primordial gas using a
newly-developed H3+ cooling function and the most detailed model of primordial
chemistry published to date. We show that although H3+ is, in most
circumstances, the third most important coolant in dense primordial gas (after
H2 and HD), it is nevertheless unimportant, as it contributes no more than a
few percent of the total cooling. We also show that in gas irradiated by a
sufficiently strong flux of cosmic rays or X-rays, H3+ can become the dominant
coolant in the gas, although the size of the flux required renders this
scenario unlikely to occur.

Arrays (PTA), are being pursued around the world. Here we develop a Bayesian
algorithm for measuring the stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from
the PTA data. Our algorithm has several strengths: (1) It analyses the data
without any loss of information, (2) It trivially removes systematic errors of
known functional form, including quadratic pulsar spin-down, annual modulations
and jumps due to a change of equipment, (3) It measures simultaneously both the
amplitude and the slope of the GWB spectrum, (4) It can deal with unevenly
sampled data and coloured pulsar noise spectra. We sample the likelihood
function using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We extensively test
our approach on mock PTA datasets, and find that the algorithm has significant
benefits over currently proposed counterparts. We show the importance of
characterising all red noise components in pulsar timing noise by demonstrating
that the presence of a red component would significantly hinder a detection of
the GWB. Lastly, we explore the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on the
duration of the experiment, number of monitored pulsars, and the magnitude of
the pulsar timing noise. These parameter studies will help formulate observing
strategies for the PTA experiments.

changing the values of resistivity and the plasmoid velocity. The plasmoid

minimal disorder introduced by substitution of 2.5% Ga or Al in Mn-site of

creates disorder within the orbital domains or on its walls, causing
enhancement of Griffiths phase (GP) singularity for the former and
disappearance of it in the later case. It is shown that Ga replaces Mn$^{3+}$
which is considered to be concentrated within the domains, whereas Al replaces
Mn$^{4+}$ which is segregated on the hole-rich walls, without causing any
significant effect on structure or ferromagnetic transition temperatures. Thus,
it is presumed that the effect of disorder created by Ga extend across the bulk
of the domain having correlation over similar length-scale resulting in
enhancement of GP phenomenon. On the contrary, effect of disorder created by Al
remains restricted to the walls resulting in the modification of the dynamics
arising from the domain walls and suppresses the GP. Moreover contrasting
features are observed in the low temperature region of the compounds; a
re-entrant spin glass like behavior is observed in the Ga doped sample, while
the observed characteristics for the Al doped sample is ascribed only to
modified domain wall dynamics with the absence of any glassy phase. Distinctive
features in third order susceptibility measurements reveals that the magnetic
ground state of the entire series comprises of orbital domain states. These
observations bring out the role of the nature of disorder on GP phenomenon and

$s$, from noisy observations $(y_\tau)$ on the regular grid $\bZd$. Our focus
is on the adaptive estimation in the case when the signal can be well recovered
using a (hypothetical) linear filter, which can depend on the unknown signal
itself.
  The basic setting of the problem we address here can be summarized as
follows: suppose that the signal $s$ is ""well-filtered"", i.e. there exists an
adapted time-invariant linear filter $q^*_T$ with the coefficients which vanish
outside the ""cube"" $\{0,..., T\}^d$ which recovers $s_0$ from observations with
small mean-squared error. We suppose that we do not know the filter $q^*$,
although, we do know that such a filter exists. We give partial answers to the
following questions: -- is it possible to construct an adaptive estimator of
the value $s_0$, which relies upon observations and recovers $s_0$ with
basically the same estimation error as the unknown filter $q^*_T$? -- how rich
is the family of well-filtered (in the above sense) signals?
  We show that the answer to the first question is affirmative and provide a
numerically efficient construction of a nonlinear adaptive filter. Further, we
establish a simple calculus of ""well-filtered"" signals, and show that their
family is quite large: it contains, for instance, sampled smooth signals,
sampled modulated smooth signals and sampled harmonic functions.

trying to identify the existence of Euclidean embeddings of these manifolds
with the existence of symmetric axial maps. As an alternative we show that the
symmetrized version of (c) captures, in a sharp way, the embedding problem.
Extensions to the case of even torsion lens spaces and complex projective

extremely low, large orders to buy or sell can only be traded incrementally,
over periods of time as long as months. As a result order flow is a highly
persistent long-memory process. Maintaining compatibility with market
efficiency has profound consequences on price formation, on the dynamics of
liquidity, and on the nature of impact. We review a body of theory that makes
detailed quantitative predictions about the volume and time dependence of
market impact, the bid-ask spread, order book dynamics, and volatility.
Comparisons to data yield some encouraging successes. This framework suggests a
novel interpretation of financial information, in which agents are at best only
weakly informed and all have a similar and extremely noisy impact on prices.
Most of the processed information appears to come from supply and demand
itself, rather than from external news. The ideas reviewed here are relevant to
market microstructure regulation, agent-based models, cost-optimal execution

opposite limit of a strongly negative tip potential, the potential depletes the
electronic density under it and divides the quantum wire into two partitions.
There the tip can push individual electrons from one partition to the other,

that this phenomenon can be used to qualitatively estimate the relative

circumbinary disks around eccentric and circular binaries. We find that
progarde, nonaxisymmetric waves are induced in the inner part of the
circumbinary disk by the tidal potential of the binary. Such waves would cause
variabilities in emission line profiles from circumbinary disks. Because of
prograde precession of the waves, the distance between each component of the
binary and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk varies with the beat period
between the precession period of the wave and the binary orbital period. As a
result, light curves from the circumbinary disks are also expected to vary with
the same period. The current study thus provides a new method to detect
circumbinary disks in various astrophysical systems.

length, extracted from two data sets for Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV amount to:
a_K+K- = (11 +- 8) + i(0 +- 6) fm for Q = 10 MeV, and a_K+K- = (0.2 +-0.2) +
i(0.0 +- 0.5) fm for Q = 28 MeV, Due to the low statistics, the extracted
values have large uncertainties and are consistent with very low values of the
real and imaginary part of the scattering length.

context of quantum groups. We prove that Kostant's cohomology formula holds for
quantum groups at a generic parameter $q$, recovering an earlier result of
Malikov in the case where the underlying semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} =
\mathfrak{sl}(n)$. We also show that Kostant's formula holds when $q$ is
specialized to an $\ell$-th root of unity for odd $\ell \ge h-1$ (where $h$ is
the Coxeter number of $\mathfrak{g}$) when the highest weight of the
coefficient module lies in the lowest alcove. This can be regarded as an
extension of results of Friedlander-Parshall and Polo-Tilouine on the
cohomology of Lie algebras of reductive algebraic groups in prime
characteristic.

internal space has the geometry of a hyperbolic disc. Compared with the ADD
model, this model provides a more satisfactory solution to the hierarchy
problem between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, and it also avoids
constraints from astrophysics. Since there is no known analytic form of the
Kaluza-Klein spectrum for our choice of geometry, we obtain a spectrum based on
a combination of approximations and numerical computations. We study the
possible signatures of our model for hadron colliders, especially the LHC,
where the most important processes are the production of a graviton together
with a hadronic jet or a photon. We find that for the case of hadronic jet
production, it is possible to obtain relatively strong signals, while for the
case of photon production, this is much more difficult.

case. The $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$ vertex of the unitarity triangle (UT)
constrained by our fits is consistent with other methods within errors. We have
found large color-suppressed, electroweak penguin and singlet penguin
amplitudes when the spectator quark ends up in the final-state vector meson.
Nontrivial relative strong phases are also required to explain the data. The
best-fit parameters are used to compute branching ratio and CP asymmetry
observables in all of the decay modes, particularly those in the $B_s$ decays
to be measured at the Tevatron and LHC experiments.

have a detailed look at the associated Standard-Model uncertainties, which are
related to doubly Cabibbo-suppressed penguin contributions, and point out that
these usually neglected effects can actually be taken into account
unambiguously through the CP asymmetries and the branching ratio of the B^0 ->
J/\psi pi^0 decay. Using the most recent B-factory measurements, we find a
negative shift of the extracted value of beta, which softens the tension in the
fits of the unitarity triangle. In addition, this strategy can be used to
constrain a possible new-physics phase in B^0-\bar B^0 mixing. The proposed
strategy is crucial to fully exploit the tremendous accuracies for the search
for this kind of new physics that can be achieved at the LHC and future
super-flavour factories.

fermionic condensate are analyzed for a massive spinor field obeying the MIT
bag boundary condition on a cylindrical shell in the cosmic string spacetime.
Both regions inside and outside the shell are considered. By applying to the
corresponding mode-sums a variant of the generalized Abel--Plana formula, we
explicitly extract the parts in the expectation values corresponding to the
cosmic string geometry without boundaries. In this way the renormalization
procedure is reduced to that for the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime. The
parts induced by the cylindrical shell are presented in terms of integrals
rapidly convergent for points away from the boundary. The behavior of the
vacuum densities is investigated in various asymptotic regions of the
parameters. In the limit of large values of the planar angle deficit, the
boundary-induced expectation values are exponentially suppressed. As a special
case, we discuss the fermionic vacuum densities for the cylindrical shell on
the background of the Minkowski spacetime.
