from Newtonian mechanics, and includes first-order corrections describing three
effects due to general relativity: precession; reduced radial coordinate; and
increased eccentricity. The quantitative prediction of increased eccentricity
may provide an additional observational test of general relativity. By analogy
with Keplerian orbits, approximate orbital energy parameters are defined in
terms of a relativistic eccentricity, providing first-order corrections to
Newtonian energies for elliptical orbits. The first-order relativistic equation
of orbit is demonstrated to be a limiting case of a very accurate
self-consistent solution. This self-consistent solution is supported by exact
numerical solutions to the Schwarzschild geometry, displaying remarkable
agreement. A more detailed energy parameterization is investigated using the
relativistic eccentricity together with the apsides derived from the
relativistic effective potential in support of the approximate energy
parameters defined using only first-order corrections. The methods and

Numerical results obtained with the test-field method, which are independent of
these approximations, confirm the results for alpha and show that gamma is in
general nonzero. Both alpha and gamma show a complex dependency on the magnetic
Reynolds number and other parameters that define the flow, that is, amplitude
and frequency of the wobbling motion. Some results for the magnetic diffusivity
eta_t and a related quantity are given, too. Finally a result for alpha in the

that both the electromagnetic field and the equations of motion are purely
real, the resulting 4-velocity is seemingly due to a complex electromagnetic
field. This work shows that this is not due to some complex formalism used
(such as Clifford algebra) but is intrinsically due to the fact that the
$o(3,1)$ Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is equivalent to two commuting
complex $su(2)$ algebras. Expressing the complex $su(2)$ generators in terms of
the boost and rotation operators then naturally introduces a complex
electromagnetic field. This work solves the equation of motion not as a matrix
equation, but as an operator evolution equation in terms of the generators of

heterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches
in 2D electron layer, enclosing an approximately circular island. Front gates
deposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device for symmetry and to
change the constriction filling, relative to the bulk. The low-field
longitudinal and Hall magnetotransport shows Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and
integer quantum Hall plateaus. A systematic variation of front-gate voltage
affects the constriction and the island electron density, while the bulk
density remains unaffected. This results in quantized plateaus in longitudinal
resistance, while the Hall resistance is dominated by the low-density,
low-filling constriction. At lower fields, when the quantum Hall plateaus fail
to develop, we observe bulk Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in series
corresponding to an integer filling of the magnetoelectric subbands in the
constrictions. This indicates that the whole interferometer region is still
quantum-coherent at these lower fields at 10 mK. Analyzing the data within a
Fock-Darwin model, we obtain the constriction electron density as a function of

stellar evolution and stellar pulsations still depend on one-dimensional
computations. The present work devises an alternative to the mixing length
theory or turbulence models usually adopted for the modelling of convective
transport in such studies. Assuming that the largest convective patterns
generate the majority of convective transport, the convective velocity field is
described using two parallel radial columns to represent up- and downstream
flows. Horizontal exchange in the form of fluid flow and radiation over their
connecting interface couples the two columns and allows a simple circulating
motion. The main parameters of this convective description have a
straightforward geometrical meaning, namely the diameter of the columns
(corresponding to the size of the convective cells) and the ratio of cross
section between up- and downdrafts. For this geometrical setup, the
time-dependent solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics is computed

Population I Cepheids of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In this process we have
identified for the first time several new types of Cepheid pulsational
behaviour. We have found two triple-mode Cepheids pulsating simultaneously in
the first three radial overtones. In 9% of the first overtone Cepheids we have
detected weak, but well resolved secondary periodicities. They appear either
very close to the primary pulsation frequency or at a much higher frequency
with a characteristic period ratio of 0.60-0.64. In either case, the secondary
periodicities must correspond to nonradial modes of oscillation. This result
presents a major challenge to the theory of stellar pulsations, which predicts
that such modes should not be exited in Cepheid variables. Nonradial modes have
also been found in three of the fundamental/first overtone double-mode
Cepheids, but no such oscillations have been detected in single mode Cepheids
pulsating in the fundamental mode. In 19% of double-mode Cepheids pulsating in
the first two radial overtones (FO/SO type) we have detected a Blazhko-type
periodic modulation of amplitudes and phases. Both modes are modulated with a
common period, which is always longer than 700 days. Variations of the two
amplitudes are anticorrelated and maximum of one amplitude always coincides
with minimum of the other. We have compared observations of modulated FO/SO
Cepheids with predictions of theoretical models of the Blazhko effect, showing
that currently most popular models cannot account for properties of these
stars. We propose that Blazhko effect in FO/SO Cepheids can be explained by a
nonstationary resonant interaction of one of the radial modes with another,
perhaps nonradial, mode of oscillations.

being estimated by fitting the X-ray continuum spectra of their accretion disk
emission. For this method, it is necessary to know the inclination of the
X-ray-producing inner region of the disk. Since the inner disk is expected to
be oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the hole, the usual practice is
to assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum
vector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter from
ellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star. We show that
the inclination of the disk can be inferred directly if we have both spectral
and polarization information on the disk radiation. The predicted degree of
polarization varies from 0% to 5% as the disk inclination changes from face-on
to edge-on. With current X-ray polarimetric techniques the polarization degree
of a typical bright X-ray binary could be measured to an accuracy of 0.1% by
observing the source for about 10 days. Such a measurement would constrain the
disk inclination to within a degree or two and would significantly improve the
reliability of black hole spin estimates. In addition, it would provide new
information on the tilt between the black hole spin axis and the orbital
rotation axis of the binary, which would constrain any velocity kicks
experienced by stellar-mass black holes during their formation.

configurations in their native fold but their function is not understood. It
has been speculated that the entanglement may inhibit mechanical protein
unfolding or transport, e.g., as in cellular threading or translocation
processes through narrow biological pores. Here we investigate tigh peptide
knot (TPK) characteristics in detail by pulling selected 3_1 and 4_1-knotted
peptides using all-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations. We find that
the 3_1 and 4_1-TPK lengths are typically Delta l~4.7 nm and 6.9 nm,
respectively, for a wide range of tensions (F < 1.5 nN), pointing to a pore
diameter of ~2 nm below which a translocated knotted protein might get stuck.
The 4_1-knot length is in agreement with recent AFM pulling experiments.
Detailed TPK characteristics however, may be sequence-specific: we find a
different size and structural behavior in polyglycines, and, strikingly, a
strong hydrogen bonding and water molecule trapping capability of hydrophobic
TPKs due to side chain shielding of the polar TPK core. Water capturing and
release is found to be controlla ble by the tightening force in a few cases.
These mechanisms result into a sequence-specific 'locking' and metastability of
TPKs what might lead to a blocking of knotted peptide transport at designated
sequence-positions. Intriguingly, macroscopic tight 4_1-knot structures are
reproduced microscopically ('figure-of-eight' vs. the 'pretzel') and can be
tuned by sequence in contrast to mathematical predictions. Our findings may
explain a function of knots in native proteins, challenge previous studies on
macromolecular knots, and may find use in bio- and nanotechnology.

the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC, which explicitly resolves
the composition of individual particles in a given population of different
types of aerosol particles. This approach accurately tracks the evolution of
the mixing state of particles due to emission, dilution, condensation and
coagulation. To make this direct stochastic particle-based method practical, we
implemented a new multiscale stochastic coagulation method. With this method we
achieved optimal efficiency for applications when the coagulation kernel is
highly non-uniform, as is the case for many realistic applications.
PartMC-MOSAIC was applied to an idealized urban plume case representative of a
large urban area to simulate the evolution of carbonaceous aerosols of
different types due to coagulation and condensation. For this urban plume
scenario we quantified the individual processes that contribute to the aging of
the aerosol distribution, illustrating the capabilities of our modeling
approach. The results showed for the first time the multidimensional structure

propagatory oscillating shock solution. In the shock-oscillation solution, the
frequency is inversely proportional to the infall time scale from the shock
location. We obtained the shock location and strength through such a fit. The
astonishing smoothness of the variation of the QPO frequency over a period of

selection minimizes possible contamination due to host galaxy emission and
Lyalpha forest absorption. Both optical and X-ray information are required to
distinguish between the two likely remaining causes of the red colors: 1)
dust-reddening and 2) an intrinsically red continuum. We find that 7 of 17
quasars can be classified as probable `intrinsically red' objects. These 7
quasars have unusually broad MgII emission lines (<FWHM>=10,500 km s^{-1}),
moderately flat, but unabsorbed X-ray spectra <Gamma>=1.66+/-0.08), and low
accretion rates (mdot/mdot_{Edd}} ~ 0.01). We suggest low accretion rates as a
possible physical explanation for quasars with intrinsically red optical
continua. We find that 8 of 17 quasars can be classified as dust-reddened.
Three of these have upper-limits on the absorption column from X-ray spectral
fits of N_H = 3-13 x 10^{22} cm^2, while the other five quasars must be
absorbed by at least N_H = 10^{23} cm^2 in order to be consistent with a

central to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and
interactive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical
devices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise
difficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This
paper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the
theory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many
information graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively
entrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to
structure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical
projection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with
phenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on
previous research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of
their target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke
these preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of
structural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding
image schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,
image schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework
for visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,
and discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of
information graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image
schemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory
of design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new
information visualization techniques.

explain the rest-frame far-infrared emission seen in galaxies and quasars in
the first Gyr of the Universe. Submillimetre observations of the Galactic
supernova remnant, Cas A, provided the first observational evidence for the
formation of significant quantities of dust in Type-II supernovae. In this
paper we present new data which show that the submm emission from Cas A is
polarised at a level significantly higher than that of its synchrotron
emission. The orientation is consistent with that of the magnetic field in Cas
A, implying that the polarised submm emission is associated with the remnant.
No known mechanism would vary the synchrotron polarisation in this way and so
we attribute the excess polarised submm flux to cold dust within the remnant,
providing fresh evidence that cosmic dust can form rapidly. This is supported
by the presence of both polarised and unpolarised dust emission in the north of
the remnant, where there is no contamination from foreground molecular clouds.
The inferred dust polarisation fraction is unprecedented (f_pol ~ 30%) which,
coupled with the brief timescale available for grain alignment (<300 yr),
suggests that supernova dust differs from that seen in other Galactic sources
(where f_pol=2-7%), or that a highly efficient grain alignment process must
operate in the environment of a supernova remnant.

Solar ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the surface and near-surface waters may
be doubled for up to a decade. This UVB level is known from experiment to be
more than enough to kill off many kinds of organisms, particularly
phytoplankton. It could easily induce a crash of the photosynthetic-based food

apparent in simulations of the atmospheric changes. We previously proposed that
the late Ordovician extinction is a plausible candidate for a contribution from
an ionizing radiation event, based on environmental selectivity in trilobites.
To test a null hypothesis based on this proposal, we confront latitudinal
differential extinction rates predicted from the simulations with data from a
published analysis of latitudinal gradients in the Ordovician extinction. The

substantially lower intensity to the north and south of this maximum. We find

component that accompanies the overall non-thermal spectra of the prompt
emission phase in GRBs. Both the temperature and flux of the thermal emission
show a well defined temporal behavior, a broken power law in time. The
temperature is nearly constant during the first few seconds, afterwards it
decays with power law index alpha ~0.7. The thermal flux also decays at late
times as a power law with index beta ~2.1. This behavior is very ubiquitous,
and was observed in a sample currently containing 32 BATSE bursts. These
results are naturally explained by considering emission from the photosphere.
The photosphere of a relativistically expanding plasma wind strongly depends on
the angle to the line of sight, theta. As a result, thermal emission can be
seen after tens of seconds. By introducing probability density function
P(r,theta) of a thermal photon to escape the plasma at radius r and angle
theta, the late time behavior of the flux can be reproduced analytically.
During the propagation below the photosphere, thermal photons lose energy as a
result of the slight misalignment of the scattering electrons velocity vectors,
which leads to photon comoving energy decay epsilon'(r)~r^{-2/3}. This in turn
can explain the decay of the temperature observed at late times. Finally, I
show that understanding the thermal emission is essential in understanding the
high energy, non-thermal spectra. Moreover, thermal emission can be used to

situations where the notion of adjacency between nodes reflects multiple
constraints. Traditional random graph models are insufficient to handle such
situations.
  A simple idea to account for multiple constraints consists in taking the
intersection of random graphs. In this paper we initiate the study of random
graphs so obtained through a simple example. We examine the intersection of an
Erdos-Renyi graph and of one-dimensional geometric random graphs. We
investigate the zero-one laws for the property that there are no isolated
nodes. When the geometric component is defined on the unit circle, a full
zero-one law is established and we determine its critical scaling. When the
geometric component lies in the unit interval, there is a gap in that the
obtained zero and one laws are found to express deviations from different
critical scalings. In particular, the first moment method requires a larger
critical scaling than in the unit circle case in order to obtain the one law.
This discrepancy is somewhat surprising given that the zero-one laws for the
absence of isolated nodes are identical in the geometric random graphs on both
the unit interval and unit circle.

individual molecules of moderate size on complex substrates: Couplings between
the STM tip and molecule and between the molecule and multiple substrate sites
are treated on the same footing, as local electrodes contacting the molecule.
Electron flow is modelled with the Lippmann-Schwinger Green function scattering
technique. The evolution of the electronic energy levels of the molecule under
bias is modelled assuming the total charge of the molecule to be invariant,
consistent with Coulomb blockade considerations, but that the electronic
occupations of the molecular HOMO and LUMO levels vary with changing bias. The
photon emission rate is calculated using Fermi's golden rule. We apply this
theoretical approach to the STM/Zn-etioporphyrin/Al2O3/NiAl(110) system, and
simulate various configurations of coupling strength between the molecule and
substrate. We compare our results to the experimental observations of Qiu,

provides a comprehensive explanation of a multitude of previously unexplained

between this large-angle anisotropy and the anomalous CMB quadrupole-octopole

consequence of one or more of the following undesired effects in CMB data: a
systematic error in the data processing or in the instrument characterization,
residual foregrounds, and large-angle correlations induced by the incomplete
sky CMB data (cut-sky masks are needed to reject Galactic foregrounds). Here,
it is proved that the North-South (NS) asymmetry is unrelated to the quadrupole
(l=2) and the octopole (l=3) properties because we find, at high confidence
levels, such large-angle anisotropy in three- and five-year WMAP CMB maps
containing only the multipole components 4 <= l <= 10. The statistical
significance depends on both, the CMB map analyzed as well as the cut-sky mask
applied to exclude foregrounds. The significance level of the NS-asymmetry is
less in five-year WMAP data with KQ75 (> 90% CL) than it is in three-year data
with Kp0 (> 96% CL). Additionally, robustness tests show that the statistical
significance of the NS-asymmetry is affected by the use of the KQ85 and KQ75

problems in astrophysics. Firstly, a methodology is developed to solve a
question in gravitational lens inversion - using the observed images of
gravitational lens systems to reconstruct the undistorted source profile and
the mass profile of the lensing galaxy. A similar technique is also applied to
the task of inferring the number and frequency of modes of oscillation of a
star from the time series observations that are used in the field of
asteroseismology. For these complex problems, many of the required calculations
cannot be done analytically, and so Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms have
been used. Finally, probabilistic reasoning is applied to a controversial
question in astrobiology: does the fact that life formed quite soon after the
Earth constitute evidence that the formation of life is quite probable, given
the right macroscopic conditions?

While the conventional metal is simply characterized by the Fermi surface (pole
of the Green function G), interference of the zero surfaces of G with the pole
surfaces becomes crucial in the doped Mott insulators. Mutually interfering
pole and zero surfaces are dramatically transferred over the Mott gap, when
lightly doped holes synergetically loosen the doublon-holon binding. The heart
of the Mott physics such as the pseudogap, hole pockets, Fermi arcs, in-gap
states, and Lifshitz transitions appears as natural consequences of this global
interference in the frequency space.

that there be no net energy exchange with the system in the non-equilibrium

temperatures of the external reservoirs goes to the same temperature $T$,
$\kappa(T)$ is given by the Green-Kubo formula, evaluated in an equilibrium
system coupled to reservoirs all having the temperature $T$. This $\kappa(T)$

2006, we choose 190 (151 M-class and 39 X-class) flare events which display
post-flare loops (PFLs), observed by 171 \AA and 195 \AA wavelengths. 124 of
the 190 events exhibit flare ribbons (FRs), observed by 1600 \AA images. We
investigate the propagation of the brightening of these PFLs along the neutral
lines and the separation of the FRs perpendicular to the neutral lines. In most
of the cases, the length of the FRs ranges from 20 Mm to 170 Mm. The
propagating duration of the brightening is from 10 to 60 minutes, and from 10
minutes to 70 minutes for the separating duration of the FRs. The velocities of
the propagation and the separation range from 3 km/s to 39 km/s and 3 km/s to
15 km/s, respectively. Both of the propagating velocities and the separating
velocities are associated with the flare strength and the length of the FRs. It
appears that the propagation and the separation are dynamically coupled, that
is the greater the propagating velocity is, the faster the separation is.
Furthermore, a greater propagating velocity corresponds to a greater
deceleration (or acceleration). These PFLs display three types of propagating
patterns. Type I propagation, which possesses about half of all the events, is
that the brightening begins at the middle part of a set of PFLs, and propagates
bi-directionally towards its both ends. Type II, possessing 30%, is that the
brightening firstly appears at one end of a set of PFLs, then propagates to the
other end. The remnant belongs to Type III propagation which displays that the
initial brightening takes place at two (or more than two) positions on two (or
more than two) sets of PFLs, and each brightening propagates bi-directionally
along the neutral line.

plausibly represent the observed relationship between the surface brightness

deepest UV investigation of a nearby cluster of galaxies made to date. The Coma
UV LFs show a faint-end slope steeper than the one observed in the local field.
This difference, more evident in NUV, is entirely due to the contribution of
massive quiescent systems (e.g. ellipticals, lenticulars and passive spirals),
more frequent in high density environments. On the contrary, the shape of the
UV LFs for Coma star-forming galaxies does not appear to be significantly
different from that of the field, consistently with previous studies of local
and high redshift clusters. We demonstrate that such similarity is only a
selection effect, not providing any information on the role of the environment
on the star formation history of cluster galaxies. By integrating the UV LFs
for star-forming galaxies (corrected for the first time for internal dust
attenuation), we show that the specific star formation rate of Coma is
significantly lower than the integrated SSFR of the field and that Coma-like
clusters contribute only <7% of the total SFR density of the local universe.
Approximately 2/3 of the whole star-formation in Coma is occurring in galaxies
with M_star < 10^10 M_sol. The vast majority of star-forming galaxies has
likely just started its first dive into the cluster core and has not yet been
affected by the cluster environment. The total stellar mass accretion rate of
Coma is ~(0.6-1.8) x 10^12 M_sol Gyr^-1, suggesting that a significant fraction
of the population of lenticular and passive spirals observed today in Coma
could originate from infalling galaxies accreted between z~1 and z~0.

of the observations and show that the predicted far-infrared properties of
model galaxies with S_850>5mJy and S_1.4>30uJy are in good agreement with
observations. Although the dust emission model does not assume a single dust
temperature, the far-infrared SEDs are well described by single component
modified black-body spectrum with characteristic temperature 32+/-5K. We also
find evidence that the observations may have uncovered evolution in the
far-infrared--radio relation in ULIRGs out to z~2. We show that the predicted
redshift distribution of sub-mm galaxies provides a reasonable fit to the
observational data with a median redshift z=2.0, with the radio-selected subset
predicted to make up approximately 75% of the population. However, the
predicted K-band and mid-infrared (3--8um) flux densities of the sub-mm
galaxies (and LBGs) are up to a factor 10x fainter than observed. This
discrepancy may indicate that the stellar masses of the sub-mm galaxies in the

M~10^11Mo. Finally, we discuss the potential modifications to the models which
may improve the fit to the observational data. [Abridged]

severe warnings about the current real-state bubble in the United States, the

therefore, an excellent test case to analyze housing dynamics in the context of
the empirical data provided by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics and

and shows that i) the house market conditions in Madrid are unstable but not
critical; and ii) the regulation of the construction rate is more effective
than interest rate changes. Our results indicate that to accommodate the
construction rate to the total population of first-time buyers is the most
effective way to maintain the system near equilibrium conditions. In addition,
we show that to raise interest rates will heavily affect the poorest housing

(C24Hn, n less than 3), in line with models of the hydrogenation state of
interstellar PAHs predicting that medium-sized species are highly
dehydrogenated. To assess the observational consequences of the latter
hypothesis we have undertaken a systematic study of the electronic spectra of
dehydrogenated PAHs. We use our first results to see whether such spectra show
strong general trends upon dehydrogenation. We used state-of-the-art techniques
in the framework of the density functional theory (DFT) to obtain the
electronic ground-state geometries, and of the time- dependent DFT to evaluate
the electronic excited-state properties. We computed the absorption
cross-section of the species C24Hn (n=12,10,8,6,4,2,0) in their neutral and
cationic charge-states. Similar calculations were performed for other PAHs and
their fullydehydrogenated counterparts. pi electron energies are always found
to be strongly affected by dehydrogenation. In all cases we examined,
progressive dehydrogenation translates into a correspondingly progressive blue
shift of the main electronic transitions. In particular, the pi-pi* collective
resonance becomes broader and bluer with dehydrogenation. Its calculated energy
position is therefore predicted to fall in the gap between the UV bump and the
far-UV rise of the extinction curve. Since this effect appears to be
systematic, it poses a tight observational limit on the column density of
strongly dehydrogenated medium-sized PAHs.

agreement with those found in the cluster centre, where the stellar density is

sigma Orionis cluster, which is considered a unique site for studying stellar
and substellar formation. The nine sources were selected because of some
peculiar properties, such as extremely red infrared colours or too strong
Halpha emission for their blue optical colours. Methods: We took high-quality,
low-resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 500) of the nine targets with ALFOSC at the
Nordic Optical Telescope. We also re-analyzed [24]-band photometry from
MIPS/Spitzer and compiled the best photometry available at the ViJHKs passbands
and the four IRAC/Spitzer channels for constructing accurate spectral energy
distributions covering from 0.55 to 24 mum. Results: The nine targets were
classified into: one Herbig Ae/Be star with a scatterer edge-on disc, two
G-type stars, one X-ray flaring, early-M, young star with chromospheric Halpha
emission, one very low-mass, accreting, young spectroscopic binary, two young
objects at the brown dwarf boundary with the characteristics of classical T
Tauri stars, and two emission-line galaxies, one undergoing star formation, and
another one whose spectral energy distribution is dominated by an active
galactic nucleus. Besides, we discover three infrared sources associated to
overdensities in a cold cloud in the cluster centre. Conclusions:
Low-resolution spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions are a vital tool

spacetime modeling the gravitational field around the Earth and an observer at

energetic particle collisions, taking into account the polarization due to the
coupling between the spin of the emitted particles and the angular momentum of
the black hole. The effect of rotation shows up in the helicity dependent
angular distribution significantly. By using this effect, there is a
possibility to determine the axis of rotation for each black hole formed,
suggesting a way to improve the statistics. Deviation from thermal spectrum is
also a signature of rotation. This deviation is due to the fact that rapidly
rotating holes have an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ significantly higher
than the Hawking temperature $T_H$. The deformation of the spectral shape
becomes evident only for very rapidly rotating cases. We show that, since the
spectrum follows a blackbody profile with an effective temperature, it is
difficult to determine both the number of extra-dimensions and the rotation
parameter from the energy spectrum alone. We argue that the helicity dependent
angular distribution may provide a way to resolve this degeneracy. We
illustrate the above results for the case of fermions.

failed experimentally so far, without a full understanding of the physics

shown that molecules can only roll when they are not too closely packed to jam.
The same type of model simulations now shows in addition that molecular rolling
friction can develop deep minima once the molecule's peripheral 'pitch' can
match the substrate periodicity, much as ordinary cogwheels do in a
rack-and-pinion system. When the pinion-rack matching is bad, the driven
molecular rolling becomes discontinuous and noisy, whence energy is dissipated
and friction is large. This suggests experiments to be conducted by varying the
rack-and-pinion matching. That could be pursued not only by changing molecules

black holes) in terms of Boltzmann's formula for entropy in statistical
mechanics. We discuss `the holographic principle' and its precise and
consequential formulation in the AdS/CFT correspondence of Maldacena. One
consequence of this correspondence is the ability to do strong coupling
calculations in SU(N) gauge theories in terms of semi-classical gravity. In
particular, we indicate a connection between dissipative fluid dynamics and the
dynamics of black hole horizons. We end with a discussion of elementary
particle physics and cosmology in the framework of string theory. We do not
cover all aspects of string theory and its applications to diverse areas of
physics and mathematics, but follow a few paths in a vast landscape of ideas.

outage-limited communications with fading, where the number of bits that arrive
at the transmitter during any time slot is random but the delivery of bits at
the receiver must adhere to a strict delay limitation. Specifically, bit errors
are caused by erroneous decoding at the receiver or violation of the strict
delay constraint. Under certain scaling of the statistics of the bit-arrival
process with SNR, this paper shows that the optimal decay behavior of the
asymptotic total probability of bit error depends on how fast the burstiness of
the source scales down with SNR. If the source burstiness scales down too
slowly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by
delay-violation events. On the other hand, if the source burstiness scales down
too quickly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by
channel-error events. However, at the proper scaling, where the burstiness
scales linearly with 1/sqrt(log SNR) and at the optimal coding duration and
transmission rate, the occurrences of channel errors and delay-violation errors
are asymptotically balanced. In this latter case, the optimal exponent of the
total probability of error reveals a tradeoff that addresses the question of
how much of the allowable time and rate should be used for gaining reliability
over the channel and how much for accommodating the burstiness with delay
constraints.

that, for any discrete source X, every ""uniquely decodable"" block code
satisfies E[l(X_1 X_2 ... X_n)]>= H(X_1,X_2,...,X_n), where X_1, X_2,...,X_n
are the first n symbols of the source, E[l(X_1 X_2 ... X_n)] is the expected
length of the code for those symbols and H(X_1,X_2,...,X_n) is their joint
entropy. We show that, for certain sources with memory, the above inequality
only holds when a limiting definition of ""uniquely decodable code"" is
considered. In particular, the above inequality is usually assumed to hold for
any ""practical code"" due to a debatable application of McMillan's theorem to
sources with memory. We thus propose a clarification of the topic, also
providing an extended version of McMillan's theorem to be used for Markovian

  $\partial_t+P(x,D)$ by large-amplitude highly oscillatory spatially dependent

chosen so that the solution to the random equation is affected by the
randomness at the leading order. We show that, when the dimension is smaller
than the order of the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $P(x,D)$, the
perturbed parabolic equation admits a solution given by a Duhamel expansion.
Moreover, as the correlation length of the potential vanishes, we show that the
latter solution converges in distribution to the solution of a stochastic
parabolic equation with a multiplicative term that should be interpreted in the
Stratonovich sense. The theory of mild solutions for such stochastic partial
differential equations is developed. The behavior described above should be
contrasted to the case of dimensions that are larger than or equal to the order
of the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $P(x,D)$. In the latter case, the
solution to the random equation converges strongly to the solution of a
homogenized (deterministic) parabolic equation as is shown in the companion
paper [2]. The stochastic model is therefore valid only for sufficiently small
space dimensions in this class of parabolic problems.

the Hamiltonian that is best known microscopically, and it is the detailed form
of the interactions between the particles, the potential energy term, that is
harder to determine from first principles. An example is the case of high
temperature superconductors: while a tight-binding model captures the kinetic
term, it is not clear that there is superconductivity with only an onsite
repulsion and, thus, that the problem is accurately described by the Hubbard
model alone. Here we pose the question of whether, once the kinetic energy is
fixed, a candidate ground state is {\it groundstatable or not}. The easiness to
answer this question is strongly related to the presence or the absence of a
sign problem in the system. When groundstatability is satisfied, it is simple
to obtain the potential energy that will lead to such a ground state. As a
concrete case study, we apply these ideas to different fermionic wavefunctions
with superconductive or spin-density wave correlations and we also study the
influence of Jastrow factors. The kinetic energy considered is a simple next

information. Firstly, we give an algorithm to obtain diagonal basis matrices
for submodules of the Z_{d}-module Z_{d}^{n} and we describe the suitable
computational basis. This algorithm is set along with the mathematical
properties and tools that are needed for symplectic diagonalisation. Secondly,
with only symplectic computational bases allowed, we get an explicit
description of the Lagrangian submodules of Z_{d}^{2n}. Thirdly, we introduce
the notion of a fringe of a Gram matrix and provide an explicit algorithm using
it in order to obtain a diagonal basis matrix with respect to a symplectic
computational basis whenever possible. If it is possible, we call the
corresponding submodule nearly symplectic. We also give an algebraic property
in order to single out symplectic submodules from nearly symplectic ones.

  Multirate IEEE 802.11","Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Wireless Communications, September
  2008",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on multirate IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN employing the
mandatory Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) option. Its aim is threefold.
Upon starting from the multi-dimensional Markovian state transition model
proposed by Malone \textit{et.al.} for characterizing the behavior of the IEEE
802.11 protocol at the Medium Access Control layer, it presents an extension
accounting for packet transmission failures due to channel errors. Second, it
establishes the conditions under which a network constituted by $N$ stations,
each station transmitting with its own bit rate, $R^{(s)}_d$, and packet rate,
$\lambda_s$, can be assumed loaded. Finally, it proposes a modified
Proportional Fairness (PF) criterion, suitable for mitigating the \textit{rate
anomaly} problem of multirate loaded IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, employing the
mandatory DCF option. Compared to the widely adopted assumption of saturated
network, the proposed fairness criterion can be applied to general loaded
networks.
  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to
greatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF, while ensuring fairness
levels among the stations of the same order as the ones guaranteed by the
classical PF criterion.
  Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed criterion for optimized throughput allocation.

  Looping","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The model of facilitated diffusion describes how DNA-binding proteins, such
as transcription factors (TFs), find their chromosomal targets by combining 3D
diffusion through the cytoplasm and 1D sliding along nonspecific DNA sequences.
The redundant 1D diffusion near the specific binding site extends the target
size and facilitates target location. While this model successfully predicts
the kinetics measured in test tubes, it has not been extended to account for
the highly crowded environment in living cells. Here, we investigate the effect
of other DNA-binding proteins that partially occupy the bacterial chromosome.
We show how they would slow down the search process, mainly through restricted
sliding near the target. This implies that increasing the overall DNA-binding
protein concentration would have a marginal effect in reducing the search time,
because any additional proteins would restrict the search process for each
other. While the presence of other proteins prevents sliding from the flanking
DNA, DNA looping provides an alternative path to transfer from neighboring
sites to the target efficiently. We propose that, when looping is faster than
the initial search process, the auxiliary binding sites further extend the
effective target region and therefore facilitate the target location.

from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a
statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system
realization. It can be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies, by performing
measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of
trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step for the
investigation of the quantum to classical boundary. While trapped atom state
reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar
experiments with trapped photons which require cavities storing light for very
long times. Here, we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial
representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which
several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Information is
extracted from the field by atoms crossing the cavity one by one. We exhibit a
gallery of pictures featuring coherent states, Fock states with a definite
photon number and Schrodinger cat states which are superpositions of coherent
states with different phases. These states are equivalently represented by
their density matrices in the photon-number basis or by their Wigner functions,
which are distributions of the field complex amplitude. Quasi-classical
coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function while Fock and
Schrodinger cat Wigner functions show oscillations and negativities revealing
quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence which quickly washes
out the Wigner functions oscillations. We observe this process and realize
movies of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrodinger cat states at
successive times.

detected through mid-infrared [Ne V] line emission. Archival Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) images reveal that the galaxy contains a bright and compact
nuclear star cluster. We present a new high-resolution optical spectrum of this
nuclear cluster, obtained with the ESI Spectrograph at the Keck Observatory.
The nucleus has a Seyfert 2 emission-line spectrum at optical wavelengths,
supporting the hypothesis that a black hole is present. The line-of-sight
stellar velocity dispersion of the cluster is sigma=43+/-3 km/s, one of the
largest dispersions measured for any nuclear cluster in a late-type spiral
galaxy. Combining this measurement with structural parameters measured from
archival HST images, we carry out dynamical modeling based on the Jeans
equation for a spherical star cluster containing a central point mass. The
maximum black hole mass consistent with the measured stellar velocity
dispersion is 3*10^6 solar masses. If the black hole mass is small compared
with the cluster's stellar mass, then the dynamical models imply a total
stellar mass of ~1*10^7 solar masses, which is consistent with rough estimates
of the stellar mass based on photometric measurements from HST images. From
structural decomposition of 2MASS images, we find no clear evidence for a bulge
in NGC 3621; the galaxy contains at most a very faint and inconspicuous
pseudobulge component (M_K>-17.6 mag). NGC 3621 provides one of the best
demonstrations that very late-type spirals can host both active nuclei and
nuclear star clusters, and that low-mass black holes can occur in disk galaxies
even in the absence of a substantial bulge.
