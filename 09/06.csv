unknown. It is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightest
supersymmetric partner of known particle species. In this case, annihilation of
dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce gamma-rays at a level
which may soon be observable. Previous work has argued that the annihilation
signal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smaller
even than the Earth) which would be most easily detected where they cluster
together in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. Here we show,
using the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, that
such small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on dark
matter detectability. Rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectable
signal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the Milky
Way. If the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumps
should also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a key
prediction of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model.

of ionizing UV radiation for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) including
self-gravity. Our method is based on the SPH/tree code VINE. We therefore call
it iVINE (for Ionization + VINE). This approach allows detailed high-resolution
studies of the effects of ionizing radiation from e.g. young massive stars on
their turbulent parental molecular clouds. In this paper we describe the
concept and the numerical implementation of the radiative transfer for a
plain-parallel geometry and we discuss several test cases demonstrating the
efficiency and accuracy of the new method. As a first application, we study the
radiatively driven implosion of marginally stable molecular clouds at various
distances of a strong UV source and show that they are driven into
gravitational collapse. The resulting cores are very compact and dense exactly
as it is observed in clustered environments. Our simulations indicate that the
time of triggered collapse depends on the distance of the core from the UV
source. Clouds closer to the source collapse several $10^5$ years earlier than
more distant clouds. This effect can explain the observed age spread in OB
associations where stars closer to the source are found to be younger. We
discuss possible uncertainties in the observational derivation of shock front
velocities due to early stripping of proto-stellar envelopes by ionizing
radiation.

estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest
simulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the
virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass
resolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos with
the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good
convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter
substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos,
but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than in
the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall
substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo.
Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we
predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3% within 100 kpc,
and to be below 0.1% within the Solar Circle. The inner density profiles of
subhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well
fit by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of
isolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al.
down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5
orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity,
subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic density
that is typically ~2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.

low significance, a similar feature exists in previous low redshift cluster

calibrating precision cosmology measurements, must be used with caution due to
their limited size and susceptibility to the effects of cosmic variance.

Our experiments reveal a stable intermediate along the mechanical unfolding
pathway, reflecting sequential unfolding of two distinct subdomains in
phytochrome, potentially the GAF and PAS domains. For the first time, our
experiments allow direct determination of knot size under load. In the unfolded
chain, the tightened knot is reduced to 17 amino acids, resulting in apparent
shortening of the polypeptide chain by 6.2 nm. Steered molecular dynamics

optical to mid-infrared observations of a sample constituted of 21 INTEGRAL
sources. We show that in the case of the obscured sources our observations
suggest the presence of absorbing material (dust and/or cold gas) enshrouding
the whole binary system. We finally discuss the nature of these two different
types of sources, in the context of high energy binary systems, and give a
scenario of unification of all these different types of high energy sources,
based on their high energy properties.

students which may be expressed when applying for certain topics.
  It is possible to observe that variable neighborhood search leads to superior
results for the tested problem instances. One instance is taken from an actual
case, while others have been generated based on the real world data to support
the analysis with a deeper analysis.
  An extension of the problem has been formulated by integrating a second

been prototypically implemented in a computer system. One important aspect in

power spectral density constitute two promising sources of information to
improve our understanding and description of the convection in outer layers of
stars. However, different instruments, using different techniques and different
bandpasses, give measurements that cannot be directly compared to each other or
to theoretical values. Aims: In this work, we define simple response functions
to derive intrinsic oscillation amplitudes and granulation power densities,
from photometry measurements obtained with a specific instrument on a specific
star. Methods: We test this method on different photometry data sets obtained
on the Sun with two different instruments in three different bandpasses.
Results: We show that the results are in good agreement and we establish
reference intrinsic values for the Sun with photometry. We also compute the
response functions of the CoRoT instrument for a range of parameters
representative of the Main Sequence solar-like pulsators to be observed with
CoRoT. We show that these response functions can be conveniently described by
simple analytic functions of the effective temperature of the target star.

because the strategies taught in schools and universities simply require
finding and applying the correct formulae or strategy to answer
well-structured, algorithmic problems. For students to develop their ability to
solve ill-structured problems, they must first believe that standardized
procedural approaches will not always be sufficient for solving ill-structured
engineering and scientific challenges. In this paper we document the range of
beliefs university students have about problem-solving. Students enrolled in a
physics course submitted a written reflection both at the start and the end of
the course on how they solve problems. We coded approximately 500 of these
reflections for the presence of different problem-solving approaches. At the
start of the semester over 50% of the students mention in written reflections
that they use Rolodex equation matching, i.e. they solve problems by searching
for equations that have the same variables as the knowns and unknowns. We then
describe the extent to which students' beliefs about physics problem-solving
change due to their experience throughout a semester with context-rich,
multifaceted problems. The frequency of strategies such as the Rolodex method
reduces only slightly by the end of the semester. However, there is an increase
in students describing more expansive strategies within their reflections. In
particular there is a large increase in describing the use of diagrams, and
thinking about concepts first. Hence the use of context-rich, multi-faceted
problems positively impacts students' attitude towards problem-solving.

proliferation of three-dimensional superconformal Chern-Simons theories whose
main ingredient is a metric 3-algebra. On the other hand, many of these
theories have been shown to allow for a reformulation in terms of standard
gauge theory coupled to matter, where the 3-algebra does not appear explicitly.
In this paper we reconcile these two sets of results by pointing out the
Lie-algebraic origin of some metric 3-algebras, including those which have
already appeared in three-dimensional superconformal Chern-Simons theories.
More precisely, we show that the real 3-algebras of Cherkis-Saemann, which
include the metric Lie 3-algebras as a special case, and the hermitian
3-algebras of Bagger-Lambert can be constructed from pairs consisting of a
metric real Lie algebra and a faithful (real or complex, respectively) unitary
representation. This construction generalises and we will see how to construct
many kinds of metric 3-algebras from pairs consisting of a real metric Lie
algebra and a faithful (real, complex or quaternionic) unitary representation.
In the real case, these 3-algebras are precisely the Cherkis-Saemann algebras,
which are then completely characterised in terms of this data. In the complex
and quaternionic cases, they constitute generalisations of the Bagger-Lambert
hermitian 3-algebras and anti-Lie triple systems, respectively, which underlie
N=6 and N=5 superconformal Chern-Simons theories, respectively. In the process
we rederive the relation between certain types of complex 3-algebras and metric
Lie superalgebras.

of the [OII] and H alpha SHELS and SDSS line fluxes, after scaling by the R

ratio of the Hectospec and SDSS spectra, smoothed over 100 Angstrom scales, is

progenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,
passively evolving systems we see today. Likewise, residual or newly accreted
reservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.
This suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonly
attributed to AGN feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelled
during a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. However,
direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of this
molecular gas and an AGN phase has been missing so far. We present new
mm-wavelength observations from the IRAM 30m telescope of a sample of low
redshift SDSS early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process of
quenching of late-time star formation. Our observations show that the
disappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 Myr with the
onset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to star
formation alone. Since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerful
quasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity AGN episodes are
sufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. This

standard Hawking-Moss tunneling. This result is under perturbative control as
long as the fluctuation determinant is well approximated by a one-loop
integral. We then move to a global description, using the methodology of
stochastic inflation and the in-in path integral formalism. This approach shows
clearly that the tunneling process becomes strongly coupled whenever the sound
speed of the tunneling trajectory departs sufficiently from unity. We argue
that these two very different perspectives are nevertheless consistent, and may
imply the existence of a simple resummation of the strongly coupled

how this growth is related in a statistical sense to star formation in the

the new observatories to undertake ambitious programs of 3-D imaging

the same spatial resolution as our extinction maps, we can directly observe the
changing extinction law as a function of the total column density. In the
Spitzer IRAC bands, 3.6-8 microns, we see evidence for grain growth. Below
$A_{K_s} = 0.5$, our extinction law is well-fit by the Weingartner & Draine
(2001) $R_V = 3.1$ diffuse interstellar medium dust model. As the extinction
increases, our law gradually flattens, and for $A_{K_s} >= 1$, the data are
more consistent with the Weingartner & Draine $R_V = 5.5$ model that uses
larger maximum dust grain sizes. At 24 microns, our extinction law is 2-4 times
higher than the values predicted by theoretical dust models, but is more
consistent with the observational results of Flaherty et al. (2007). Lastly,
from our chi-squared maps we identify a region in Perseus where the IRAC
extinction law is anomalously high considering its column density. A steeper
near-infrared extinction law than the one we have assumed may partially explain

Based on the concept of renormalization, the Landau's {\em Fermi liquid} theory

free electron theory works so well for simple metals with extended Fermi
surface (FS). The recent synthesis of graphene has provided the condensed
matter physicists with a low energy laboratory of Dirac fermions where instead
of a FS, one has two Fermi points. Many exciting phenomena in graphene can be
successfully interpreted in terms of free Dirac electrons. In this paper,
employing dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we show that an interacting Dirac
sea is essentially an effective free Dirac theory. This observation suggests
the notion of {\em Dirac liquid} as a fixed point of interacting 2+1

luminous EELRs are found almost exclusively around steep-spectrum radio-loud
quasars, with apparently disordered global velocity fields, and little, if any,
morphological correlation with either the host-galaxy or the radio structure.
Our new observations confirm and expand these results. The EELRs often show
some clouds with velocities exceeding 500 km/s, ranging up to 1100 km/s, but
the velocity dispersions, with few exceptions, are in the 30-100 km/s range.
Emission-line ratios show that the EELRs are clearly photoionized by the
quasars. Masses of the EELRs range up to >10^10 Msun. Essentially all of the
EELRs show relatively low metallicities, and they are associated with quasars
that, in contrast to most, show similarly low metallicities in their broad-line
regions. The two objects in our sample that do not have classical double-lobed
radio morphologies (3C48, with a compact-steep-spectrum source; Mrk1014,
radio-quiet, but with a weak compact-steep-spectrum source) are the only ones
that appear to have recent star formation. While some of the less-luminous
EELRs may have other origins, the most likely explanation for the ones in our
sample is that they are examples of gas swept out of the host galaxy by a
large-solid-angle blast wave accompanying the production of the radio jets. The
triggering of the quasar activity is almost certainly the result of the merger
of a gas-rich galaxy with a massive, gas-poor galaxy hosting the supermassive
black hole.

us to identify stable configurations when pressure forces are unimportant, and

properties of host bulges, the dynamic evolution of a bulge and the formation

$M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ power laws based on our recent theoretical analyses (Lou &
Wang; Wang & Lou; Lou, Jiang & Jin) for a self-similar general polytropic
quasi-static dynamic evolution of bulges with self-gravity and spherical
symmetry and present a sensible criterion of forming a central SMBH. The key
result is $M_{\rm BH}={\cal L}\sigma^{1/(1-n)}$ where $2/3<n<1$ and ${\cal L}$
is a proportional coefficient characteristic of different classes of host
bulges. By fitting and comparing several empirical $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ power
laws, we conclude that SMBHs and galactic bulges grow and evolve in a coeval
manner and most likely there exist several classes of galactic bulge systems in
quasi-static self-similar evolution and that to mix them together can lead to
an unrealistic fitting. Based on our bulge-SMBH model, we provide explanations
for intrinsic scatter in the relation and a unified scenario for the formation

studying the coronal heating problem and understanding the initiation and
propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We assume here that the corona is
in a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium and that, because of the low plasma beta,
one may decouple the magnetic forces from pressure and gravity. The magnetic
field is then described by a force-free field for which we perform a
statistical study of the magnetic field strength with height for four different
active regions. The plasma along each field line is assumed to be in a
hydrostatic equilibrium. As a first approximation, the coronal plasma is
assumed to be isothermal with a constant or varying gravity with height. We
study a bipolar magnetic field with a ring distribution of currents, and apply
this method to four active regions associated with different eruptive events.
By studying the global properties of the magnetic field strength above active
regions, we conclude that (i) most of the magnetic flux is localized within 50
Mm of the photosphere, (ii) most of the energy is stored in the corona below
150 Mm, (iii) most of the magnetic field strength decays with height for a
nonlinear force-free field slower than for a potential field. The Alfven speed
values in an isothermal atmosphere can vary by two orders of magnitude (up to
100000 km/s). The global properties of the Alfven speed are sensitive to the
nature of the magnetic configuration. For an active region with highly twisted
flux tubes, the Alfven speed is significantly increased at the typical height
of the twisted flux bundles; in flaring regions, the average Alfven speeds are
above 5000 km/s and depart strongly from potential field values.

concentration currently known and has <0.01% chance of being drawn from the
underlying selection function for SMGs. We have compared UV observations of
galaxies at this redshift, where we find a much less dramatic overdensity,
having an 11% chance of being drawn from its selection function. We use this
z~1.99 overdensity to compare the biasing of UV- and submm-selected galaxies,
and test whether SMGs could reside in less overdense environments, with their
apparent clustering signal being dominated by highly active merger periods in
modest mass structures. This impressively active formation phase in a low mass
cluster is not something seen in simulations, although we propose a toy model
using merger bias which could account for the bias seen in the SMGs. While
enhanced buildup of stellar mass appears characteristic of other high-z galaxy
clusters, neither the UV- nor submm-galaxies in this structure exhibit larger
stellar masses than their field galaxy counterparts (although the excess of
SMGs in the structure represents a larger volume-averaged stellar mass than the
field). Our findings have strong implications for future surveys for high-z
galaxies at long wavelengths such as SCUBA2 and Herschel. We suggest that since
these surveys will select galaxies during their episodes of peak starbursts,
they could probe a much wider range of environments than just the progenitors
of rich clusters, revealing more completely the key events and stages in galaxy
formation and assembly.

""cascades"" of streamwise momentum toward the viscous layer at the wall. We
present in this paper an alternative picture of these flows as ""inverse
cascades"" of spanwise vorticity, in the cross-stream direction but away from
the viscous sublayer. We show that there is a constant spatial flux of spanwise
vorticity, due to vorticity conservation, and that this flux is necessary to
produce pressure-drop and energy dissipation. The vorticity transport is shown
to be dominated by viscous diffusion at distances closer to the wall than the
peak Reynolds stress, well into the classical log-layer. The Perry-Chong model
based on ""representative"" hairpin/horsehoe vortices predicts a single sign of
the turbulent vorticity flux over the whole log-layer, whereas the actual flux
must change sign at the location of the Reynolds-stress maximum. Sign-reversal
may be achieved by assuming a slow power-law decay of the Townsend ""eddy
intensity function"" for wall-normal distances greater than the hairpin
length-scale. The vortex-cascade picture presented here has a close analogue in
the theory of quantum superfluids and superconductors, the ""phase slippage"" of
quantized vortex lines. Most of our results should therefore apply as well to
superfluid turbulence in pipes and channels. We also discuss issues about
drag-reduction from this perspective.

be represented as a point of the unit sphere S in the Hilbert space of
square-integrable functions. If the density function depends smoothly on a set
of parameters, the image of the map forms a Riemannian submanifold M in S. The
metric on M induced by the ambient spherical geometry of S is the Fisher
information matrix. Statistical properties of the system modelled by a
parametric density function p can then be expressed in terms of information
geometry. An elementary introduction to information geometry is presented,
followed by a precise geometric characterisation of the family of Gaussian
density functions. When the parametric density function describes the
equilibrium state of a physical system, certain physical characteristics can be
identified with geometric features of the associated information manifold M.
Applying this idea, the properties of vapour-liquid phase transitions are
elucidated in geometrical terms. For an ideal gas, phase transitions are absent
and the geometry of M is flat. In this case, the solutions to the geodesic
equations yield the adiabatic equations of state. For a van der Waals gas, the
associated geometry of M is highly nontrivial. The scalar curvature of M
diverges along the spinodal boundary which envelopes the unphysical region in

energy resonances were observed, one originated from the E1-E1 dipolar
transition and the other from the E2-E2 quadrupolar transition. These
resonances directly probe the valence 5d band and the partially occupied 4f
band, respectively. First, full polarization analysis, which is a measurement
of the scattered polarization as a function of incident polarization, confirmed
a spin polarization of the terbium valence states (probed by the E1-E1
transition) by the $\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$ spin density in the commensurate phase.
Second, full polarization analysis data were collected in the low-temperature
incommensurate and commensurate phases when tuned to the E2-E2 resonance. By
employing a least-squares fitting procedure, the spin orientations of the
terbium ion sublattice were refined.

angles and relative separations are meaningful. Barbour--Bertotti (1982) theory
is of this form and can be viewed as a recovery of (a portion of) Newtonian
mechanics from relational premises. This is of interest in the absolute versus
relative motion debate and also shares a number of features with the
geometrodynamical formulation of general relativity, making it suitable for
some modelling of the problem of time in quantum gravity. I also study
similarity relational particle mechanics (`dynamics of pure shape'), in which
only relative times, relative angles and {\sl ratios of} relative separations
are meaningful. This I consider firstly as it is simpler, particularly in 1 and
2 d, for which the configuration space geometry turns out to be well-known,
e.g. S^2 for the `triangleland' (3-particle) case that I consider in detail.
Secondly, the similarity model occurs as a sub-model within the Euclidean
model: that admits a shape--scale split. For harmonic oscillator like
potentials, similarity triangleland model turns out to have the same
mathematics as a family of rigid rotor problems, while the Euclidean case turns
out to have parallels with the Kepler--Coulomb problem in spherical and
parabolic coordinates. Previous work on relational mechanics covered cases
where the constituent subsystems do not exchange relative angular momentum,
which is a simplifying (but in some ways undesirable) feature paralleling
centrality in ordinary mechanics. In this paper I lift this restriction. In
each case I reduce the relational problem to a standard one, thus obtain
various exact, asymptotic and numerical solutions, and then recast these into
the original mechanical variables for physical interpretation.

to quantum computing systems. We show that ground-state and time-dependent
density functional theory can be applied to quantum computing systems by
proving the Hohenberg-Kohn and Runge-Gross theorems for a fermionic
representation of an N qubit system. As a first demonstration of this approach,
time-dependent density functional theory is used to determine the minimum
energy gap Delta(N) arising when the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm is
used to solve instances of the NP-Complete problem MAXCUT. It is known that the
computational efficiency of this algorithm is largely determined by the large-N
scaling behavior of Delta(N), and so determining this behavior is of
fundamental significance. As density functional theory has been used to study
quantum systems with N ~ 1000 interacting degrees of freedom, the approach
introduced in this paper raises the realistic prospect of evaluating the gap
Delta(N) for systems with N ~ 1000 qubits. Although the calculation of Delta(N)
serves to illustrate how density functional theory methods can be applied to
problems in quantum computing, the approach has a much broader range and shows
promise as a means for determining the properties of very large quantum
computing systems.

folding pathways encountered in response to free energy perturbations such as
those induced by mutation. Here we explore the relation between folding
plasticity and a gross, generic feature of the native geometry, namely, the
relative number of local and non-local native contacts. The results from our
study, which is based on Monte Carlo simulations of simple lattice proteins,
show that folding to a structure that is rich in local contacts is considerably
more plastic than folding to a native geometry characterized by having a very
large number of long-range contacts (i.e., contacts between amino acids that
are separated by more than 12 units of backbone distance). The smaller folding
plasticity of `non-local' native geometries is probably a direct consequence of
their higher folding cooperativity that renders the folding reaction more
robust against single- and multiple-point mutations.
