invariant under collinear gauge transformations by multiplying them with
collinear Wilson lines. We discuss how we can quantize SCET directly in terms
of these gauge invariant fields, allowing to directly calculate S matrix
elements using the gauge invariant collinear fields. We also show how for each

are given by the usual QCD Lagrangian, and how external operators coupling
these different directions can be constructed.

environment of each galaxy is robustly measured. By comparing narrow band
spectral line indices with recent models of simple stellar populations (SSPs)
we investigate trends in the star formation history as a function of galaxy
mass (velocity dispersion), density of environment and galactic radius. We find
that age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement all increase with galaxy mass and
that field ETGs are younger than their cluster counterparts by ~2 Gyr. We find
negative radial metallicity gradients for all masses and environments, and
positive radial age gradients for ETGs with velocity dispersion over 180 km/s.
Our results are qualitatively consistent with a relatively simple picture for
ETG evolution in which the low-mass halos accreted by a proto-ETG contained not
only gas but also a stellar population. This fossil population is
preferentially found at large radii in massive ETGs because the stellar
accretions were dissipationless. We estimate that the typical, massive ETG
should have been assembled at z < 3.5. The process is similar in the cluster
and the field but occurred earlier in dense environments.

surface to populate a magnetosphere, a similar process can occur as a result of

with the overall study of neutron star oscillation modes but with a particular
focus on the situation for magnetars. Following a previous Newtonian analysis
of the production of a force-free magnetosphere in this way Timokhin et al.
(2000), we present here a corresponding general-relativistic analysis. We give
a derivation of the general relativistic Maxwell equations for small-amplitude
arbitrary oscillations of a non-rotating neutron star with a generic magnetic
field and show that these can be solved analytically under the assumption of
low current density in the magnetosphere. We apply our formalism to toroidal
oscillations of a neutron star with a dipole magnetic field and find that the
low current density approximation is valid for at least half of the oscillation
modes, similarly to the Newtonian case. Using an improved formula for the
determination of the last closed field line, we calculate the energy losses
resulting from toroidal stellar oscillations for all of the modes for which the
size of the polar cap is small. We find that general relativistic effects lead
to shrinking of the size of the polar cap and an increase in the energy density
of the outflowing plasma. These effects act in opposite directions but the net
result is that the energy loss from the neutron star is significantly smaller
than suggested by the Newtonian treatment.

reexamined in this much expanded version of [Europhys. Lett. {\bf 76} 457

is equivalent to the decaying Burgers equation, with viscosity $\nu \sim T$ -
both being formally irrelevant. Analogy between Kolmogorov scaling and FRG
cumulant scaling is discussed. Next we prove that the FRG function $R(u)$ and
higher cumulants defined from the field theory can be obtained {\it for any
$d$} from moments of a renormalized potential defined in an sliding harmonic
well. This allows to measure the fixed point function $R(u)$ in numerics and
experiments. In $d=0$ the beta function (of the inviscid limit) is obtained
from first principles to four loop. For Sinai model (uncorrelated Burgers
initial velocities) the ERG hierarchy can be solved and the exact function
$R(u)$ is obtained. Connections to exact solutions for the statistics of shocks
in Burgers and to ballistic aggregation is detailed. A relation is established
between the size distribution of shocks and the one for droplets. A droplet
solution to the ERG functional hierarchy is found for any $d$, and the form of
$R(u)$ in the thermal boundary layer is related to droplet probabilities. These
being known for the $d=0$ Sinai model the function $R(u)$ is obtained there at
any $T$. Consistency of the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion in one and two loop FRG is
studied from first principles, and connected to shock and droplet relations

exponential tail at high energies, which is analogous to the case of diffusive
shock acceleration. The influences of reconnection parameters on the spectral

reveals a moderately blue, stellar host galaxy in all sample galaxies. The
detection of a stellar host in all galaxies studied here and all previously
studied extremely metal-deficient SF galaxies implies that they are unlikely to
be forming their first generation of stars. With regard to the structural
properties of their host galaxy, we demonstrate that these systems are
indistinguishable from blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies. However, in contrast
to the majority (>90%) of BCDs that are characterised by red elliptical host
galaxies, extremely metal-poor SF dwarfs (hereafter XBCDs) reveal moderately
blue and irregular hosts. This is consistent with a young evolutionary status
and in the framework of standard star formation histories implies that several
XBCDs formed most of their stellar mass in the past 2 Gyr. A large fraction of
XBCDs reveal a cometary morphology due to the presence of intense SF activity
at one edge of an elongated host galaxy with a gradually decreasing surface
brightness towards its antipodal end.

random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq1$.
  We start with the quenched case, take the point of view of the particle, and
prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for the pair empirical measure of the
environment Markov chain. By an appropriate contraction, we deduce the quenched
LDP for the mean velocity of the particle and obtain a variational formula for
the corresponding rate function $I_q$. We propose an Ansatz for the minimizer
of this formula. This Ansatz is easily verified when $d=1$.
  In his 2003 paper, Varadhan proves the averaged LDP for the mean velocity and
gives a variational formula for the corresponding rate function $I_a$. Under
the non-nestling assumption (resp. Kalikow's condition), we show that $I_a$ is
strictly convex and analytic on a non-empty open set $\mathcal{A}$, and that
the true velocity $\xi_o$ is an element (resp. in the closure) of
$\mathcal{A}$. We then identify the minimizer of Varadhan's variational formula
at any $\xi\in\mathcal{A}$.
  For walks in high dimension, we believe that $I_a$ and $I_q$ agree on a set
with non-empty interior. We prove this for space-time walks when the dimension
is at least 3+1. In the latter case, we show that the cheapest way to condition
the asymptotic mean velocity of the particle to be equal to any $\xi$ close to
$\xi_o$ is to tilt the transition kernel of the environment Markov chain via a
Doob $h$-transform.

$m_K\gg m_\pi$) and so is not soft, nevertheless it is possible to compute the
chiral logarithms, i.e. the corrections of $O(m_\pi^2\log(m_\pi^2))$. We
envisage that our results at $q^2=0$ will be useful in extrapolating lattice
QCD results to physical masses. A consequence of the Callan-Treiman relation is
that in the $\SU(2)$ chiral limit ($m_u=m_d=0$), the scalar form factor $f^0$
at $\qsqmax$ is equal to $f^{(K)}/f$, the ratio of the kaon and pion leptonic
decay constants in the chiral limit. Lattice results for the scalar form factor
at $\qsqmax$ are obtained with excellent precision, but at the masses at which
the simulations are performed the results are about 25% below $f^{(K)}/f$ and
are increasing only very slowly. We investigate the chiral behaviour of
$f^0(\qsqmax)$ and find large corrections which provide a semi-quantitative
explanation of the difference between the lattice results and $f^{(K)}/f$. We
stress the generality of the relation $f^0_{P\to\pi}(\qsqmax)=f^{(P)}/f$ in the
