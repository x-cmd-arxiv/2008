in a class of local F-theory GUT models where the scale of supersymmetry
breaking determines the value of the mu term. Geometrically correlating these
two scales constrains the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the MSSM. In this
scenario, the hidden SUSY breaking sector involves an anomalous U(1)
Peccei-Quinn symmetry which forbids bare mu and B mu terms. This sector
typically breaks supersymmetry at the desired range of energy scales through a
simple stringy hybrid of a Fayet and Polonyi model. A variant of the
Giudice-Masiero mechanism generates the value mu ~ 10^2 - 10^3 GeV when the
hidden sector scale of supersymmetry breaking is F^(1/2) ~ 10^(8.5) GeV.
Further, the B mu problem is solved due to the mild hierarchy between the GUT
scale and Planck scale. These models relate SUSY breaking with the QCD axion,
and solve the strong CP problem through an axion with decay constant f_a ~
M_(GUT) * mu / L, where L ~ 10^5 GeV is the characteristic scale of gaugino
mass unification in gauge mediated models, and the ratio \mu / L ~
M_(GUT)/M_(pl) ~ 10^(-3). We find f_a ~ 10^12 GeV, which is near the high end
of the phenomenologically viable window. Here, the axino is the goldstino mode
which is eaten by the gravitino. The gravitino is the LSP with a mass of about
10^1 - 10^2 MeV, and a bino-like neutralino is (typically) the NLSP with mass
of about 10^2 - 10^3 GeV. Compatibility with electroweak symmetry breaking also
determines the value of tan(beta) ~ 30 +/- 7.

the complete range of azimuthal angles between hadronic and leptonic planes,
phi, enabling us to separate the phi-dependent terms. Our measurements of

fragmentation calculation can account for almost all of the observed cross
section, even at small pi+ momentum. The measured center-of-momentum spectra

observed that the two phi-dependent terms of the cross section are small.

dynamical fields in cosmology to include the role of the average density in the
determination of inertial frames. The resulting cosmological equivalence
principle is applied to the problem of synchronisation of clocks in the
observed universe. Once density perturbations grow to give density contrasts of
order one on scales of tens of megaparsecs, the integrated deceleration of the
local background regions of voids relative to galaxies must be accounted for in
the relative synchronisation of clocks of ideal observers who measure an
isotropic cosmic microwave background. The relative deceleration of the
background can be expected to represent a scale in which weak-field Newtonian
dynamics should be modified to account for dynamical gradients in the Ricci
scalar curvature of space. This acceleration scale is estimated using the
best-fit nonlinear bubble model of the universe with backreaction. At redshifts
z < 0.25 the scale is found to coincide with the empirical acceleration scale
of modified Newtonian dynamics. At larger redshifts the scale varies in a
manner which is likely to be important for understanding dynamics of galaxy
clusters, and structure formation. Although the relative deceleration,
typically of order 10^{-10} m/s^2, is small, when integrated over the lifetime
of the universe it amounts to an accumulated relative difference of 38% in the
rate of average clocks in galaxies as compared to volume-average clocks in the
emptiness of voids. A number of foundational aspects of the cosmological
equivalence principle are also discussed, including its relation to Mach's
principle, the Weyl curvature hypothesis and the initial conditions of the

which individual photons of energy above several tens of MeV have been detected
with a pair-conversion tracker telescope. This burst was discovered with the
Italian AGILE gamma-ray satellite. The GRB was localized with a cooperation by
AGILE and the interplanetary network (IPN). The gamma-ray imager (GRID)
estimate of the position, obtained before the SuperAGILE-IPN localization, is
found to be consistent with the burst position. The hard X-ray emission
observed by SuperAGILE lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that the
emission above 30 MeV extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). Similar
behavior was seen in the past from a few other GRBs observed with EGRET.
However, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, by
instrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burst
intensity. Thanks to the small dead time of the AGILE/GRID we could assess that
in the case of GRB 080514B the gamma-ray to X-ray flux ratio changes
significantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

evolution. In this paper we try to identify the organizational level of life,
that spans several orders of magnitude from the elementary constituents to

S in PV whose equation s is skew-invariant, and that the singular locus of S is
the modular fivefold. In particular, over Z[1/3], the modular fivefold is cut
out by the 14 partial derivatives of s. Better: these equations generate I_8.
In characteristic 3, the cubic s is needed to generate the ideal. The existence
of such a cubic was predicted by Dolgachev. Over Q, we recover the 14 quadrics

representation-theoretic description of the presentation. Additionally we find

result: for every context-free language L, there is a bounded context-free
language L' included in L which has the same Parikh (commutative) image as L.
Bounded languages, introduced by Ginsburg and Spanier, are subsets of regular
languages of the form w1*w2*...wk* for some finite words w1,...,wk. In
particular bounded subsets of context-free languages have nice structural and
decidability properties. Our proof proceeds in two parts. First, using Newton's
iterations on the language semiring, we construct a context-free subset Ls of L
that can be represented as a sequence of substitutions on a linear language and
has the same Parikh image as L. Second, we inductively construct a
Parikh-equivalent bounded context-free subset of Ls.
  We show two applications of this result in model checking: to
underapproximate the reachable state space of multithreaded procedural programs
and to underapproximate the reachable state space of recursive counter
programs. The bounded language constructed above provides a decidable
underapproximation for the original problems. By iterating the construction, we
get a semi-algorithm for the original problems that constructs a sequence of
underapproximations such that no two underapproximations of the sequence can be
compared. This provides a progress guarantee: every word w in L is in some
underapproximation of the sequence. In addition, we show that our approach
subsumes context-bounded reachability for multithreaded programs.

increase robustness, accessibility, and reliability of data transmission.
Recently, network coding has been proposed as a solution to provide agile and
cost efficient network protection against link failures, which does not require
data rerouting, or packet retransmission. To achieve this, separate paths have
to be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition
of extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose. In this
paper, we propose network protection codes against a single link failure using
network coding, where a separate path using reserved links is not needed. In
this case portions of the link capacities are used to carry the encoded
packets.
  The scheme is extended to protect against multiple link failures and can be
implemented at an overlay layer. Although this leads to reducing the network
capacity, the network capacity reduction is asymptotically small in most cases
of practical interest. We demonstrate that such network protection codes are

role in the next generation of atomic clocks, gravitational wave detectors, and
in quantum information science. For experimental implementations the robustness
of the phase resolution is crucial since any experimental realization will be
subject to imperfections. In this article we study the robustness of phase
reconstruction with two number states as input subject to fluctuations in the
state preparation. We find that the phase resolution is insensitive to
fluctuations in the total number of particles and robust against noise in the
number difference at the input. The phase resolution depends on the uncertainty
in the number difference in a universal way that has a clear physical
interpretation: Fundamental noise due to the Heisenberg limit and noise due to
state preparation imperfection contribute essentially independently to the
total uncertainty in the phase. For number difference uncertainties less than
one the first noise source is dominant and the phase resolution is essentially
Heisenberg limited. For number difference uncertainties greater than one the
noise due to state preparation imperfection is dominant and the phase
resolution deteriorates linearly with the number difference uncertainty.

problem that arises in many applications in control theory, machine learning,

minimization, is NP-HARD, and for most practical problems there are no
efficient algorithms that yield exact solutions. A popular heuristic algorithm
replaces the rank function with the nuclear norm--equal to the sum of the
singular values--of the decision variable. In this paper, we provide a
necessary and sufficient condition that quantifies when this heuristic
successfully finds the minimum rank solution of a linear constraint set. We
additionally provide a probability distribution over instances of the affine
rank minimization problem such that instances sampled from this distribution
satisfy our conditions for success with overwhelming probability provided the
number of constraints is appropriately large. Finally, we give empirical

The shear moduli in the paramagnetic state reveal an absence of Jahn-Teller
activity despite the presence of orbital degeneracy in the Co$^{2+}$ ions. Such
a Jahn-Teller inactivity indicates that the intersite orbital-orbital
interaction is much stronger than the Jahn-Teller coupling. The compression
moduli in the paramagnetic state near the N$\acute{e}$el temperature $T_N$
reveal that the most relevant exchange path for the antiferromagnetic
transition lies in the [111] direction. This exchange-path anisotropy is
consistent with the antiferromagnetic structure with the wave vector $q
\parallel$ [111], suggesting the presence of bond frustration due to
competition among a direct ferromagnetic and several distant-neighbors
antiferromagnetic interactions. In the JT-inactive condition, the bond
frustration can be induced by geometrical orbital frustration of
$t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ interaction between the Co$^{2+}$ ions which can be realized
in the pyrochlore lattice of the high spin Co$^{2+}$ with $t_{2g}$-orbital
degeneracy. In GeCo$_2$O$_4$, the tetragonal elongation below $T_N$ releases
the orbital frustration by quenching the orbital degeneracy.

The properties of MRC 2025-218 are particularly conducive to study the nature
of the absorbing gas, i.e., this galaxy shows bright and spatially extended
Ly-alpha emission, along with bright continuum emission from the active
nucleus. Ly-alpha absorption is detected across ~40x30 kpc^2, has a covering
factor of ~1, and shows remarkably little variation in its properties across
its entire spatial extent. This absorber is kinematically detached from the
extended emission line region (EELR). Its properties suggest that the absorber
is outside of the EELR. We derive lower limits to the HI, HII and H column
densities for this absorber of 3x10^16, 7x10^17 and 2x10^18 cm^-2,
respectively. Moreover, the relatively bright emission from the active nucleus
has allowed us to measure a number of metal absorption lines: CI, CII, CIV, NV,
OI, SiII, SiIV, AlII and AlIII. The column density ratios are most naturally
explained using photoionization by a hard continuum, with an ionization
parameter U~0.0005-0.005. Shocks or photoionization by young stars cannot
reproduce satisfactorily the measured column ratios. Using the ratio between
the SiII* and SiII column densities, we derive a lower limit of >10 cm^-3 for
the electron density of the absorber. The data do not allow useful constraints
to be placed on the metallicity of the absorber. We consider two possibilities
for the nature of this absorber: the cosmological infall of gas, and an outflow
driven by supernovae or the radio-jets.

statistics of 21-cm fluctuations using analytic and semi-numerical modelling.
Following the reionisation of hydrogen the HI content of the Universe is
dominated by damped absorption systems (DLAs), with a cosmic density in HI that
is observed to be constant at a level equal to ~2% of the cosmic baryon density
from z~1 to z~5. We show that extrapolation of this constant fraction into the
reionisation epoch results in a reduction of 10-20% in the amplitude of 21-cm
fluctuations over a range of spatial scales. The assumption of a different
percentage during the reionisation era results in a proportional change in the
21-cm fluctuation amplitude. We find that consideration of HI in galaxies/DLAs
reduces the prominence of the HII region induced shoulder in the 21-cm power
spectrum (PS), and hence modifies the scale dependence of 21-cm fluctuations.
We also estimate the 21cm-galaxy cross PS, and show that the cross PS changes
sign on scales corresponding to the HII regions. From consideration of the
sensitivity for forthcoming low-frequency arrays we find that the effects of HI
in galaxies/DLAs on the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations will be significant
with respect to the precision of a PS or cross PS measurement. In addition,
since overdense regions are reionised first we demonstrate that the
cross-correlation between galaxies and 21-cm emission changes sign at the end
of the reionisation era, providing an alternative avenue to pinpoint the end of
reionisation. The sum of our analysis indicates that the HI content of the
galaxies that reionise the universe will need to be considered in detailed
modelling of the 21-cm intensity PS in order to correctly interpret
measurements from forthcoming low-frequency arrays.

temperature of the dual black hole. The presence of these factors is confirmed
in the experimental data for $\rho, \omega, \phi, J/\psi,$ and $\psi(2S)$
photoproduction and is compatible with the meager $\Upsilon$ photoproduction
data. Throughout, we use vector meson dominance, and from the data we obtain
$T_0$ of about $1.3 GeV$, i.e. the gauge theory ""Planck scale,"" as expected.
The ratio of the experimental soft Pomeron onset scale $\hat{E}_R\sim 9$ GeV
and of the gauge theory Planck scale, $T_0 \sim 1.3$ GeV conforms to the
theoretical prediction of $N_c^2/N_c^{1/4}$.

by dust emissions. During the eclipse, the X-ray spectrum becomes only the dust
scattering (scattered-in) component. The optical depth of the dust-scattering

the neutron star surface and a disk-blackbody. No power-law component is found
in the hard energy band up to 30 keV. A clear edge at ~7.1 keV in the deep dip

transient phase dominated by shocks, turbulence evolves into a steady state
with an RMS Mach number about 2.5, in which cloud-like structures of over-dense
gas are surrounded by highly rarefied gas. The index of the turbulence energy
spectrum function beta = 2.0 in the shock-dominated phase. As the flow
approaches statistical equilibrium, the spectrum flattens, with beta = 1.9. For
the scaling exponent of the root mean square velocity fluctuation, we obtain
gamma = 0.43 from the velocity structure functions of second order. These
results are well within the range of observed scaling properties for the
velocity dispersion in molecular clouds. Calculating structure functions of
order p=1,...,5, we find for all scaling exponents significant deviations from
the Kolmogorov-Burgers model proposed by Boldyrev. Our results are very well
described by a general log-Poisson model with a higher degree of intermittency,
which implies an influence of the forcing on the scaling properties. Contrary
to previous numerical results for isothermal turbulence, we obtain a skewed

hierarchical structure formation model, dark matter halo properties, such as
the density profile, the phase-space density profile, the distribution of axial
ratio, the distribution of spin parameter, and the distribution of internal
specific angular momentum follow `universal' laws or distributions. Here we
study the properties of the first generation of haloes in a Hot Dark Matter
(HDM) dominated universe, as an example of halo formation through monolithic
collapse. We find all these universalities to be present in this case also.
Halo density profiles are very well fit by the Navarro et al (1997) profile
over two orders of magnitude in mass. The concentration parameter depends on
mass as $c \propto M^{0.2}$,reversing the dependence found in a hierarchical
CDM universe. However, the concentration-formation time relation is similar in
the two cases: earlier forming haloes tend to be more concentrated than their
later forming counterparts. Halo formation histories are also characterized by
two phases in the HDM case: an early phase of rapid accretion followed by
slower growth. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the HDM
and CDM cases concerning the statistics of other halo properties: the
phase-space density profile; the velocity anisotropy profile; the distribution
of shape parameters; the distribution of spin parameter, and the distribution
of internal specific angular momentum are all similar in the two cases. Only
substructure content differs dramatically. These results indicate that mergers
do not play a pivotal role in establishing the universalities, thus
contradicting models which explain them as consequences of mergers.

embedded with sources of radiation whose properties are either based on

sources, whose radial ionized fraction and temperature profiles are derived
from a catalogue of 1-D radiative transfer experiments. In case of overlap of
these spheres, photons are conserved by redistributing them around the
connected ionized regions corresponding to the spheres. The efficiency with
which these maps are created allows us to span the large parameter space

accepted as an established fact that M32 is a compact dwarf satellite of M31.
The purpose of this paper is to report on the findings of our investigation
into the nature of the existing evidence. We find that the case for M32 being a
satellite of M31 rests upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) based stellar
population studies which have resolved red-giant branch (RGB) and red clump
stars in M32 as well as other nearby galaxies. Taken in isolation, this recent
evidence could be considered to be conclusive in favour of the existing view.
However, the conventional scenario does not explain M32's anomalously high
central velocity dispersion for a dwarf galaxy (several times that of either
NGC 147, NGC 185 or NGC 205) or existing planetary nebula observations (which
suggest that M32 is more than twice as distant as M31) and also requires an
elaborate physical explanation for M32's inferred compactness. Conversely, we
find that the case for M32 being a normal galaxy, of the order of three times
as distant as M31, is supported by: (1) a central velocity dispersion typical
of intermediate galaxies, (2) the published planetary nebula observations, and
(3) known scaling relationships for normal early-type galaxies. However, this
novel scenario cannot account for the high apparent luminosities of the RGB
stars resolved in the M32 direction by HST observations. We are therefore left
with two apparently irreconcilable scenarios, only one of which can be correct,
but both of which suffer from potentially fatal evidence to the contrary. This
suggests that current understanding of some relevant fields is still very far
from adequate.

in the gas phase in dense inter- and circumstellar regions. Photodesorption is
a non-thermal desorption mechanism, which may explain the small amounts of
observed cold gas in cloud cores and disk mid-planes. This paper aims to
determine the UV photodesorption yields and to constrain the photodesorption
mechanisms of three astrochemically relevant ices: CO, N2 and CO2. In addition,
the possibility of co-desorption in mixed and layered CO:N2 ices is explored.
The ice photodesorption is studied experimentally under ultra high vacuum
conditions and at 15-60 K using a hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV). The ice
desorption during irradiation is monitored by reflection absorption infrared
spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry of the desorbed
molecules. Both the UV photodesorption yields per incident photon and the
photodesorption mechanisms are molecule specific. CO photodesorbs without
dissociation from the surface layer of the ice. N2, which lacks an electronic
transition in this wavelength range, has a photodesorption yield that is more
than an order of magnitude lower. This yield increases significantly due to
co-desorption when N2 is mixed in with or layered on top of CO ice. CO2
photodesorbs through dissociation and subsequent recombination from the top 10
layers of the ice. At low temperatures (15-18 K) the derived photodesorption
yields are 2.7x10^-3 and <2x10^-4 molecules photon-1 for pure CO and N2,
respectively. The CO2 photodesorption yield is 1.2x10^-3x(1-e^(-X/2.9)) +
1.1x10^-3x(1-e^(-X/4.6)) molecules photon-1, where X is the ice thickness in
monolayers and the two parts of the expression represent a CO2 and CO

two wings of a seagull. Galaxies in the right wing are referred to as
Seyfert/LINERs, leading to the idea that non-stellar activity in galaxies is a
very common phenomenon. Here, we argue that a large fraction of the systems in
the right wing could actually be galaxies which stopped forming stars. The
ionization in these ""retired"" galaxies would be produced by hot post-AGB stars
and white dwarfs. Our argumentation is based on a stellar population analysis
of the galaxies via our STARLIGHT code and on photoionization models using the
Lyman continuum radiation predicted for this population. The proportion of
LINER galaxies that can be explained in such a way is however uncertain. We
further show how observational selection effects account for the shape of the
right wing. Our study suggests that nuclear activity may not be as common as
thought. If retired galaxies do explain a large part of the seagull's right
wing, some of the work concerning nuclear activity in galaxies, as inferred

soliton string is chosen as the thermal background. We find that this bulk
phase transition corresponds to a 4-dimensional flat AdS black hole to AdS
soliton phase transition on the boundary Karch-Randall branes. We compute the
possibility of a phase transition from a flat AdS black string to a
5-dimensional AdS soliton and show that, though possible for certain thin black
strings, the transition to the AdS soliton string is preferred. In contrast to
the case of the Schwarzschild-AdS black string, we find that the specific heat
of the flat AdS black string is always positive; hence it is thermodynamically
stable. We show numerically that both the flat AdS black string and AdS soliton
string are free of a Gregory-Laflamme instability for all values of the mass
parameter. Therefore the Gubser-Mitra conjecture holds for these spacetimes.

dots in the spin blockade regime. By analysing the time evolution of the
density matrix, we obtain the spin resolved currents and derive from a
generating function an expression for the fluctuations and correlations. Both
the charge current and the spin current turn out to be generally
super-Poissonian. Moreover, we study the influence of ac fields acting upon the
transported electrons. In particular, we focus on fields that cause spin
rotation or photon-assisted tunnelling.

observed by VLBI, is the fundamental celestial reference frame adopted by the
IAU in 1997. Within the next 10 years, the European space astrometry mission
Gaia, to be launched by 2011, will permit determination of the extragalactic
reference frame directly in the visible for the first time. Aligning these two
frames with the highest accuracy will therefore be very important in the future
for ensuring consistency between the measured radio and optical positions. This
paper is aimed at evaluating the current astrometric suitability of the
individual ICRF radio sources which are considered appropriate for the
alignment with the future Gaia frame. To this purpose, we cross-identified the
ICRF and the optical catalog V\'eron-Cetty and V\'eron (2006), to identify the
optically-bright ICRF sources that will be positioned with the highest accuracy
with Gaia. Then we investigated the astrometric suitability of these sources by
examining their VLBI brightness distribution. We identified 243 candidate ICRF
sources for the alignment with the Gaia frame (with an optical counterpart
brighter than the apparent magnitude 18), but only 70 of these (10% of the ICRF
sources) are found to have the necessary high astrometric quality (i.e. a
brightness distribution that is compact enough) for this link. Additionally, it
was found that the QSOs that will have the most accurate positions in the Gaia
frame tend to have less-accurate VLBI positions, most probably because of their
physical structures. Altogether, this indicates that identifying other
high-quality VLBI radio sources suitable for the alignment with the future Gaia
frame is mandatory.
