energetic jets or energetic hadrons, important constraints are provided by
reparameterization invariance (RPI). RPI encodes Lorentz invariance in a power
expansion about a collinear direction, and connects the Wilson coefficients of
operators at different orders in this expansion to all orders in alphas. We
construct reparameterization invariant collinear objects. The expansion of
operators built from these objects provides an efficient way of deriving RPI
relations and finding a minimal basis of operators, particularly when one has
an observable with multiple collinear directions and/or soft particles.
Complete basis of operators are constructed for pure glue currents at twist-4,
and for operators involving multiple collinear directions, including those
appearing in e+e- -> 3 jets, and for pp-> 2 jets initiated via gluon-fusion.

neutron stars is studied by means of 3D axi-symmetric general relativistic
hydrodynamics. The set of fully general relativistic Navier-Stokes equations is
solved implicitly using the implicit solver GR-I-RMHD in combination with a
third order spatial and second order temporal advection scheme. The viscous
operators are formulated using a Kerr-like metric in the fixed background of a
slowly rotating neutron star whose radius coincides with the corresponding last
stable orbit. The importance of these operators and their possible
simplifications are discussed as well. In the rotating case and depending on
the viscosity parameter, $\alpha_\mm{tur}$, it is found that the
viscously-initiated fronts at the center of bursts propagate at much faster
speed than the fluid motion. These fast fronts act to decouple angular momentum
from matter: angular momentum is transported outwards while matter sinks
inwards into the deep gravitational well of the neutron star, thereby enhancing
the compression of matter necessary for initiating ignition, that subsequently
spreads over the whole surface of the neutron star on the viscous time scale.
Based on the numerical simulations, we find that a viscosity parameter
$\alpha_\mm{tur} = \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ is most suitable for fitting observations
of neutron stars during X-ray bursts. It is argued that the spin up observed in
the cooling tails of X-ray bursts is a transient phase, which eventually should
be followed by a spin down phase. This delay can be attributed to a significant
lengthening of the viscous time scale due to rapid cooling of matter in the
outer layers.

Relativity (GR), except for the fact that the effective cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ has the status of an integration constant. Here, we explore various
formulations of unimodular gravity beyond the classical limit. We first
consider the non-generally covariant action formulation in which the
determinant of the metric is held fixed to unity. We argue that the
corresponding quantum theory is also equivalent to General Relativity for
localized perturbative processes which take place in generic backgrounds of
infinite volume (such as asymptotically flat spacetimes). Next, using the same
action, we calculate semiclassical non-perturbative quantities, which we expect
will be dominated by Euclidean instanton solutions. We derive the entropy/area
ratio for cosmological and black hole horizons, finding agreement with GR for
solutions in backgrounds of infinite volume, but disagreement for backgrounds
with finite volume. In deriving the above results, the path integral is taken
over histories with fixed 4-volume. We point out that the results are different
if we allow the 4-volume of the different histories to vary over a continuum
range. In this ""generalized"" version of unimodular gravity, one recovers the
full set of Einstein's equations in the classical limit, including the trace,
so $\Lambda$ is no longer an integration constant. Finally, we consider the
generally covariant theory due to Henneaux and Teitelboim, which is classically
equivalent to unimodular gravity. In this case, the standard semiclassical GR
results are recovered provided that the boundary term in the Euclidean action
is chosen appropriately.

spacecraft.The first issue addressed here is: are the so far published
evaluations of the systematic uncertainty induced by the bad knowledge of the
even zonal harmonic coefficients J_L of the multipolar expansion of the Earth's
geopotential reliable and realistic?
  Our answer is negative. Indeed, if the differences Delta J_L among the even
zonals estimated in different Earth's gravity field global solutions from the
dedicated GRACE mission are assumed for the uncertainties delta J_L instead of
using their covariance sigmas sigma_JL, it turns out that the systematic
uncertainty \delta\mu in the Lense-Thirring test with the nodes Omega of LAGEOS
and LAGEOS II may be up to 3 to 4 times larger than in the evaluations so far
published ($5-10%$) based on the use of the sigmas of one model at a time
separately. The second issue consists of the possibility of using a different
approach in extracting the relativistic signature of interest from the
LAGEOS-type data. The third issue is the possibility of reaching a realistic
total accuracy of 1% with LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES, which should be launched
in November 2009 with a VEGA rocket. While LAGEOS and LAGEOS II fly at
altitudes of about 6000 km, LARES will be likely placed at an altitude of 1450
km. Thus, it will be sensitive to much more even zonals than LAGEOS and LAGEOS
II. Their corrupting impact has been evaluated with the standard Kaula's
approach up to degree L=60 by using Delta J_L and sigma_JL; it turns out that
it may be as large as some tens percent.

modest for all three stars, suggesting that the discrepancy between the [C I]

bring the [C I] and C I abundances into better agreement; however, targeted

the diffusion coefficient over 2 orders of magnitude. We show that in the
diffusive limit, the decoherence time follows a power law as a function of
diffusion coefficient as expected by theory. When the disorder is low enough so
that the samples are semi-ballistic, we observe a new and unexpected regime in
which the phase coherence time is independent of disorder. In addition, for all
samples the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time follows a power
law down to the lowest temperatures without any sign of saturation and strongly
suggests that the frequently observed low temperature saturation is not

The interaction of silver atoms is modeled by a tight-binding semiempirical

functions and the pair analysis technique is applied to reveal the structural
transition in the process of solidification. It is shown that Ag nanoparticles
evolve into different nanostructures under different cooling processes. At a

amorphous like structure containing a large amount of 1551 and 1541 pairs which

($1.5625\times10^{12} Ks^{-1}$), the nanoparticles transform into a
crystal-like structure consisting mainly of 1421 and 1422 pairs which

the nova to decline 2 and 3 magnitudes from maximum light (t_2 and t_3) was
~9.5 and ~13 days, respectively, establishing that M31N 2007-11d was a
moderately fast declining nova. During the nova's evolution a total of three
spectra were obtained. The first spectrum was obtained one day after maximum
light (5 days post-discovery), followed by two additional spectra taken on the
decline at two and three weeks post-maximum. The initial spectrum reveals
narrow Balmer and Fe II emission with P Cygni profiles superimposed on a blue
continuum. These data along with the spectra obtained on the subsequent decline
clearly establish that M31N 2007-11d belongs to the Fe II spectroscopic class.
The properties of M31N 2007-11d are discussed within the context of other
luminous novae in M31, the Galaxy, and the LMC. Overall, M31N 2007-11d appears
to be remarkably similar to Nova LMC 1991, which was another bright,

extragalactic novae suggest that the >~4 day rise to maximum light seen in M31N

way to extend the Hubble diagram to very high redshift. However, the large
scatter in their intrinsic properties prevents directly using them as distance
indicator so that the hunt is open for a relation involving an observable
property to standardize GRBs in the same way as the Phillips law makes it
possible to use Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) as standardizable candles. We use
here the data on the X - ray decay curve and spectral index of a sample of GRBs
observed with the Swift satellite. These data are used as input to a Bayesian
statistical analysis looking for a correlation between the X - ray luminosity
L_X(T_a) and the time constant T_a of the afterglow curve. We find a linear
relation between \log{[L_X(T_a)]} and \log{[T_a/(1+z)]} with an intrinsic
scatter sigma_{int} = 0.33 comparable to previously reported relations.
Remarkably, both the slope and the intrinsic scatter are almost independent on
the matter density Omega_M and the constant equation of state w of the dark
energy component thus suggesting that the circularity problem is alleviated for
the $L_X - T_a$ relation.

surveys of molecular line emission along the Galactic Plane. We calculate GMC
masses within the SRBY cloud boundaries assuming LTE conditions throughout the
cloud and a constant H2 to 13CO abundance, while accounting for the variation
of the 12C/13C with Galacto-centric radius. The LTE derived masses are
typically five times smaller than the SRBY virial masses. The corresponding
median mass surface density of molecular hydrogen for this sample is 42
Msun/pc^2, which is significantly lower than the value derived by SRBY (median
206 Msun/pc^2) that has been widely adopted by most models of cloud evolution
and star formation. This discrepancy arises from both the extrapolation by SRBY
of velocity dispersion, size, and CO luminosity to the 1K antenna temperature
isophote that likely overestimates the GMC masses and our assumption of
constant 13CO abundance over the projected area of each cloud. Owing to the
uncertainty of molecular abundances in the envelopes of clouds, the mass
surface density of giant molecular clouds could be larger than the values
derived from our 13CO measurements. From velocity dispersions derived from the
13CO data, we find that the coefficient of the cloud structure functions,
vo=sigma_v/R^{1/2}, is not constant, as required to satisfy Larson's scaling
relationships, but rather systematically varies with the surface density of the
cloud as Sigma^{0.5} as expected for clouds in self-gravitational equlibrium.

interact with each other. In graph theory such groups are known as clusters or
communities. Many different techniques have been recently proposed to detect
them, some of which involve inference methods using either Bayesian or Maximum
Likelihood approaches. In this article, we study a statistical model designed
for detecting clusters based on connection similarity. The basic assumption of
the model is that the graph was generated by a certain grouping of the nodes
and an Expectation Maximization algorithm is employed to infer that grouping.
We show that the method admits further development to yield a stability
analysis of the groupings that quantifies the extent to which each node
influences its neighbors group membership. Our approach naturally allows for
the identification of the key elements responsible for the grouping and their
resilience to changes in the network. Given the generality of the assumptions
underlying the statistical model, such nodes are likely to play special roles
in the original system. We illustrate this point by analyzing several empirical

major challenges in the field. Unlike the case of observations at radio
wavelengths, in the optical the atmospheric turbulence changes the phases on a
very short time scale, which results in corrupted phase measurements. In order
to overcome these limitations, several groups developed image reconstruction
techniques based only on squared visibility and closure phase information,
which are unaffected by atmospheric turbulence. We present the results of two
techniques used by our group, which employed coherently integrated data from
the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer. Based on these techniques we were
able to recover complex visibilities for several sources and image them using
standard radio imaging software. We describe these techniques, the corrections
applied to the data, present the images of a few sources, and discuss the
implications of these results.

controller includes a digital filter comprising two cascaded second-order
sections (""biquads""), which together can implement transfer functions for
optimal cantilever controllers. An appendix in this report shows how to
calculate filter coefficients for an optimal controller from measured
cantilever characteristics. The controller also includes an input multiplexer
and adder used in calibration protocols. Filter coefficients and multiplexer
settings can be set and adjusted by control software while an experiment is
running. The input is sampled at 64 MHz; the sampling frequency in the filters
can be divided down under software control to achieve a good match with filter
characterisics. Data reported here were sampled at 500 kHz, chosen for acoustic
cantilevers with resonant frequencies near 8 kHz. Inputs are digitized with 12
bits resolution, outputs with 14 bits. The experiment software is organized as
a client and server to make it easy to adapt the controller to different
experiments. The server encapusulates the details of controller hardware
organization, connection technology, filter architecture, and number

circumplanetary disk. Jupiter forms via a combination of planetesimal accretion
and gravitational accumulation of gas from the surrounding solar nebula. The
formation of the circumjovian gaseous disk, or subnebula, straddles the
transitional stage between runaway gas accretion and Jupiter's eventual
isolation from the solar disk. This isolation, which effectively signals the
termination of Jupiter's accretion, takes place as Jupiter opens a deep gas gap
in the solar nebula, or the solar nebula gas dissipates. We describe the
conditions for accretion of the Galilean satellites, including the timescales
for their formation, and mechanisms for their survival, all within the context
of key constraints for satellite formation models. The environment in which the
regular satellites form is tied to the timescale for circumplanetary disk
dispersal, which depends on the nature and persistence of turbulence. In the
case that subnebula turbulence decays as gas inflow wanes, we present a novel
mechanism for satellite survival involving gap opening by the largest
satellites. On the other hand, assuming that sustained turbulence drives
subnebula evolution on a short timescale compared to the satellite formation
timescale, we review a model that emphasizes collisional processes to explain
satellite observations. We briefly discuss the mechanisms by which solids may
be delivered to the circumplanetary disk. However, we expect that planetesimal
delivery mechanisms likely provide the bulk of material for satellite
accretion.

determine the subsurface structural differences between solar active and quiet
regions. Results obtained by inverting the frequency differences between the
regions are usually interpreted as the sound-speed differences between them.
These in turn are used as a measure of temperature and magnetic-field strength
differences between the two regions. In this paper we first show that the
""sound-speed"" difference obtained from inversions is actually a combination of
sound-speed difference and a magnetic component. Hence, the inversion result is
not directly related to the thermal structure. Next, using solar models that
include magnetic fields, we develop a formulation to use the inversion results
to infer the differences in the magnetic and thermal structures between active
and quiet regions. We then apply our technique to existing structure inversion
results for different pairs of active and quiet regions. We find that the
effect of magnetic fields is strongest in a shallow region above 0.985R_sun and
that the strengths of magnetic-field effects at the surface and in the deeper
(r < 0.98R_sun) layers are inversely related, i.e., the stronger the surface
magnetic field the smaller the magnetic effects in the deeper layers, and vice
versa. We also find that the magnetic effects in the deeper layers are the
strongest in the quiet regions, consistent with the fact that these are
basically regions with weakest magnetic fields at the surface. Because the
quiet regions were selected to precede or follow their companion active
regions, the results could have implications about the evolution of magnetic

Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired
through filamentary ""cold mode"" accretion of gas that was never shock heated to
its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results
obtained with a different SPH code (Keres et al. 2005). Atmospheres of hot,
virialized gas develop in halos above ~2.5e11 Msun, a transition mass that is
nearly constant from z=3 to z=0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the
transition mass, especially at z>=2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low
mass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation
history. Satellite galaxies have accretion rates similar to central galaxies of
the same baryonic mass at high redshifts, but they have less accretion than
comparable central galaxies at low redshift. Relative to our earlier results,
the Gadget-2 simulations predict much lower rates of ""hot mode"" accretion from
the virialized gas component of massive halos. At z<=1, typical hot accretion
rates in halos above 5e12 Msun are below 1 Msun/yr, even though our simulation
does not include AGN heating or other forms of ""preventive"" feedback. The inner
density profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associated
cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can
overestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so such
models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed
galaxy masses and colors. A fraction of the massive halos develop cuspy
profiles and significant cooling rates between z=1 and z=0, a redshift trend
similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.

simulations, assuming that the SG is formed by the gas ejected by AGB stars.
This gas collects in a cooling flow into the cluster core, where it forms a SG
star subsystem strongly concentrated in the cluster innermost regions with
structural properties largely independent of the FG initial properties. We also
present the results of a model in which pristine gas contributes to the SG
formation. In this model a very helium-rich SG population and one with a
moderate helium enrichment form; the resulting SG bimodal helium distribution
resembles that observed for SG stars in NGC 2808. By means of N-body
simulations, we study the two-population cluster dynamical evolution. In our
simulations, a large fraction of FG stars are lost early in the cluster
evolution due to the expansion and stripping of the cluster outer layers
resulting from early mass loss associated with FG SN ejecta. The SG population
is largely unscathed by this early mass loss, and this early evolution leads to
values of the SG to FG number ratio consistent with observations. We also
demonstrate possible evolutionary routes leading to the loss of most of the FG
population, leaving an SG-dominated cluster. Until mixing of the two
populations is complete, the radial profile of the SG to FG number ratio is
characterized by a flat inner part and a declining portion in the outer cluster

derive a median slope $\alpha$ in each simulation and for each definition of Q.
Our main findings are: 1. The various Q(r) profiles follow a power law to a
good approximation. 2. The slopes depend on the concentration parameter c of
the DM haloes, where for $c \gtrsim 10$ the slopes steepen with rising
concentration and for $c \lesssim 10$ the trend flattens and even turns around.
3. The asymptotic value of $\beta$ as $r\to R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ increases with
the value of c. 4. In accordance with Zait et al. 2007 $\alpha_{\mathrm{rad}}$
becomes more negative as the asymptotic value of $\beta$ at the virial radius

mechanism consistent with the integration of heavy moduli. This way of
uplifting vacua guarantees that the interaction of the uplifting sector with
the moduli sector is consistent with integrating out the heavy fields in a
supersymmetric way. The interactions between light and heavy fields are
characterized in terms of the Kahler invariant function, G = K + log |W|^2,
which is required to be separable in the two sectors. We generalize earlier
results that when the heavy fields are stabilized at a minimum of the Kahler
function G before the uplifting (corresponding to stable AdS maxima of the
potential), they remain in a perturbatively stable configuration for
arbitrarily high values of the cosmological constant (or the Hubble parameter
during inflation). By contrast, supersymmetric minima and saddle points of the
scalar potential are always destabilized for sufficiently large amount of
uplifting. We prove that these results remain unchanged after including gauge
couplings in the model. We also show that in more general scenarios, where the
Kahler function is not separable in the light and heavy sectors, the minima of
the Kahler function still have better stability properties at large uplifting
than other types of critical points.

possible contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we estimate that
~5 detections are possible LMXBs instead of true AGNs, based on the probability
of observing a LMXB in a nuclear star cluster typically found in these

contamination by high-mass X-ray binaries is unlikely. This AGN fraction is
higher than that observed in optical surveys, indicating that active nuclei,

incidence of AGN activity in such late-type spiral galaxies also suggests that
nuclear massive black holes can form and grow in galaxies with little or no

various coordinate systems. This has been done primarily to understand the
nature of the coordinate singularity at the event horizon. However, very often,
the mathematics of a coordinate system does not provide a clear physical
interpretation. In Schwarzschild's original work, the origin of the radial
coordinate was at the event horizon. Hence, there was no black hole. The
generally accepted current definition of the radial coordinate has an origin
beyond the horizon. This necessitates the discussion of black holes. Here, some
well-known and some not-so-well-known coordinate systems will be visited in
search of a physical interpretation. It will be noted that they all agree at
large radial distances. However, the location of the origin of the radial
coordinate can be different for different systems. Some ""natural"" coordinate
systems can exclude the entirety of the interior of a black hole from the
physical manifold. Such coordinate systems maybe physically more acceptable as
they avoid the issue of the metric signature change across the horizon.
Mathematically, the metric signature alone can distinguish time from space
coordinates. Hence, coordinate systems that include the interior of the black
hole need to switch the physical meanings of time and one of the space
coordinates.

fluctuations originate, are irrevocably coupled to local dynamical lattice
instabilities and form composite charge-lattice excitations of the system. For
a superconducting phase to be realized, such excitations must be itinerant

in and out of polaronic cation-ligand sites. Materials in which
superconductivity driven by such local lattice instability can be expected,
have a Tc which is controlled by the phase stiffness rather than the amplitude
of the diamagnetic pair fluctuations. Above Tc, a pseudogap phase will be
maintained up to a T*, where this pairing amplitude disappears. We discuss the

nucleosynthesis at the base of the convective envelope, in addition to the slow
neutron capture process operating in the He-shell (the s-process). We compare
the predicted abundances of elements up to Sr from models of intermediate-mass
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to measured abundances in Type I PNe. In
particular, we compare predictions and observations for the light trans-iron
elements Se and Kr, in order to constrain convective mixing and the s-process
in these stars. A partial mixing zone is included in selected models to explore
the effect of a 13C pocket on the s-process yields. The solar-metallicity
models produce enrichments of [(Se, Kr)/Fe] < 0.6, consistent with Galactic
Type I PNe where the observed enhancements are typically < 0.3 dex, while lower
metallicity models predict larger enrichments of C, N, Se, and Kr. O
destruction occurs in the most massive models but it is not efficient enough to
account for the > 0.3 dex O depletions observed in some Type I PNe. It is not
possible to reach firm conclusions regarding the neutron source operating in
massive AGB stars from Se and Kr abundances in Type I PNe; abundances for more
s-process elements may help to distinguish between the two neutron sources. We
predict that only the most massive models would evolve into Type I PNe,

The per-trigger away-side yield of direct $\gamma$ is smaller than from

the I$_{CP}$ of direct $\gamma$ and $\pi^{0}$ are similar.

reside in the 2.40 < r < 2.54 range, and in binary group V selenides they shift
to a lower r, in the 2.29< r < 2.40 range. Here r represents the mean
coordination number of glasses. In ternary alloys containing equal proportions
of group IV and V selenides, IPs are wider and encompass ranges of respective
binary glasses. These data suggest that the local structural variance
contributing to IP widths largely derives from four isostatic local structures
of varying connectivity r; two include group V based quasi-tetrahedral (r =
2.29) and pyramidal (r = 2.40) units, and the other two are group IV based
corner-sharing (r = 2.40) and edge-sharing (r = 2.67) tetrahedral units.
Remarkably, binary group V (P, As) sulfides exhibit IPs that are shifted to
even a lower r than their selenide counterparts; a result that we trace to
excess Sn chains either partially (As-S) or completely (P-S) demixing from
network backbone, in contrast to excess Sen chains forming part of the backbone
in corresponding selenide glasses. In ternary chalcogenides of Ge with the
group V elements (As, P), IPs of the sulfides are similar to their selenide
counterparts, suggesting that presence of Ge serves to reign in the excess Sn
chain fragments back in the backbone as in their selenide counterparts.

have argued that the event horizon is quite close to the outer horizon, and it

while the FFLO-BCS phase transition is second order, consistent with the

continuous, the Ne'el temperature of AF order is discontinuous at the phase
boundary because the AF order in the FFLO state is induced by the Andreev bound
state localized in the zeros of FFLO order parameter, while the AF order hardly
occurs in the uniform BCS state. The spatial structure of the magnetic moment
is investigated for the commensurate AF state as well as for the incommensurate

energetic radiation (FUV, 6eV $<h\nu<$13.6eV; EUV, 13.6eV $<h\nu<$0.1keV; and
Xrays, $h\nu>0.1$keV) from its central star. We focus on the effects of FUV and
X-ray photons since EUV photoevaporation has been treated previously, and
consider central star masses in the range $0.3-7 {\rm M}_{\odot}$. Contrary to
the EUV photoevaporation scenario, which creates a gap at about $r_g\sim 7\
(M_*/1{\rm M}_{\odot})$ AU and then erodes the outer disk from inside out, we
find that FUV photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the
outer disk. Heating by FUV photons can cause significant erosion of the outer
disk where most of the mass is typically located. X-rays indirectly increase
the mass loss rates (by a factor $\sim 2$) by ionizing the gas, thereby
reducing the positive charge on grains and PAHs and enhancing FUV-induced grain
photoelectric heating. FUV and X-ray photons may create a gap in the disk at
$\sim 10$ AU under favourable circumstances. Photoevaporation timescales for
M$_* \sim 1{\rm M}_{\odot}$ stars are estimated to be $\sim 10^6$ years, after
the onset of disk irradiation by FUV and X-rays. Disk lifetimes do not vary
much for stellar masses in the range $0.3-3$M$_{\odot}$. More massive stars
($\gtrsim 7 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) lose their disks rapidly (in $\sim 10^5$ years)
due to their high EUV and FUV fields. Disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow
surface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced
by processes such as grain growth or settling. The latter suggests that the
photoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves.

first luminous sources in the universe. These stars are believed to form in the

stellar masses up to \sim1000 solar masses and/or have very long lifetimes. The
UV photons from these objects could therefore contribute significantly to
cosmic reionization. Here we show that such dark star models would require a
somewhat artificial reionization history, based on a double-reionization phase
and a late star-burst near redshift $z\sim6$, in order to fulfill the WMAP
constraint on the optical depth as well as the Gunn-Peterson constraint at
$z\sim6$. This suggests that, if dark stars were common in the early universe,
then models are preferred which predict a number of UV photons similar to
conventional Pop. III stars. This excludes dark stars with 100 solar masses
that enter a main-sequence phase and other models that lead to a strong
increase in the number of UV photons. We also derive constraints for massive as
well as light dark matter candidates from the observed X-ray, gamma-ray and
neutrino background, considering dark matter profiles which have been steepened
during the formation of dark stars. This increases the clumping factor at high
redshift and gives rise to a higher dark matter annihilation rate in the early

annihilation products in the remnants of dark stars, which may provide a
promising path to constrain such models further, but which is currently still
uncertain.

rationalized into different classes of objects, in which differences between
circumstellar and interstellar matter are emphasised. We probe the links
between the mid-IR emitters observed in planetary nebulae (PNe) and their
counterparts in the interstellar medium in order to probe a scenario in which
the latter have been formed in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars.
The mid-IR (6-14 um) emission spectra of PNe and compact HII regions were
analysed on the basis of previous work on photodissociation regions (PDRs).
Galactic, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
objects were considered in our sample.We show that the mid-IR emission of PNe
can be decomposed as the sum of six components. Some components made of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and very small grain (VSG) populations
are similar to those observed in PDRs. Others are fitted in an evolutionary
scenario involving the destruction of the aliphatic component observed in the
post-AGB stage, as well as strong processing of PAHs in the extreme conditions
of PNe that leads to a population of very large ionized PAHs. This species
called PAH^x are proposed as the carriers of a characteristic band at 7.90 um.
This band can be used as part of diagnostics that identify PNe in nearby
galaxies and is also observed in galactic compact HII regions. These results
support the formation of the aromatic very small dust particles in the
envelopes of evolved stars, in the Milky Way, as well as in the LMC and SMC,
and their subsequent survival in the interstellar medium.

simultaneously fit the parameters of interest, and a Monte Carlo error

our method, while also introducing new near infrared data of GRB 990510 which
further constrains the value of the host extinction. Our method is effective in
estimating the photometric redshift of GRBs, relatively unbiased by assumptions
of the afterglow spectral index or the host galaxy extinction. Monte Carlo

patterns in a semiconductor nanostructure (double barrier resonant tunnelling

features of noise-induced oscillations compared to single time feedback,
rendering the system more sensitive to variations in the delay time $\tau$. The
coherence of noise-induced oscillations measured by the correlation time
exhibits sharp resonances as a function of $\tau$, and can be strongly
increased by optimal choices of $\tau$. Similarly, the peaks in the power
spectral density are sharpened. We provide analytical insight into the control
mechanism by relating the correlation times and mean frequencies of
noise-induced breathing oscillations to the stability properties of the
deterministic stationary current density filaments under the influence of the
control loop. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of multiple time delays
enlarges the regime in which the deterministic dynamical properties of the

application leads to fast $p$-adic agglomerative hierarchic algorithms similar
to the ones recently used e.g. by A. Khrennikov and others. From the viewpoint
of $p$-adic geometry, to encode a dendrogram $X$ in a $p$-adic field $K$ means
to fix a set $S$ of $K$-rational punctures on the $p$-adic projective line
$\mathbb{P}^1$. To $\mathbb{P}^1\setminus S$ is associated in a natural way a
subtree inside the Bruhat-Tits tree which recovers $X$, a method first used by
F. Kato in 1999 in the classification of discrete subgroups of

$\mathbb{P}^1$ with $n$ punctures can be applied to the study of time series of
dendrograms and those symmetries arising from hyperbolic actions on
$\mathbb{P}^1$. In this way, we can associate to certain classes of dynamical
systems a Mumford curve, i.e. a $p$-adic algebraic curve with totally
degenerate reduction modulo $p$.
  Finally, we indicate some of our results in the study of general discrete
actions on $\mathbb{P}^1$, and their relation to $p$-adic Hurwitz spaces.

ratios should therefore provide valuable tools for diagnosing flares and
tokamak plasmas. It is concluded that Fe lines in the 7.7--8.6 keV range are

In this paper we consider the unimodality problem of a sequence of binomial
coefficients located in a ray or a transversal of the Pascal triangle. Our
results give in particular an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Belbachir
et al which asserts that such a sequence of binomial coefficients must be
unimodal. We also propose two more general conjectures.

the R_{\xi/\sigma} class of non-linear gauges that preserves the Higgs-boson
low-energy theorem. The R_{\xi/\sigma} gauge involves two gauge-fixing
parameters \xi and \sigma, and is a renormalizable extension of the Feynman--'t
Hooft R_\xi set of gauges beyond the 1-loop level. By taking consistently into
account Goldstone--gauge-boson mixing effects, we show how the 1-loop effective
potential evaluated at its extrema is independent of both \xi and \sigma, in
agreement with the Nielsen identity. The 1-loop constant and wavefunction
renormalizations are presented within this non-linear R_{\xi/\sigma} class of
gauges.

samples. Galaxies in these clusters have been identified in the Main Galaxy
Sample of the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of SDSS. We analyse which galaxy
properties correlate best with either, cluster mass or cluster-centric distance
using the technique by Blanton et al. We find that galaxy properties do not
clearly depend on cluster mass for clusters more massive than M~10^{14}M_sun.
On the other hand, galaxy properties correlate with cluster-centric distance.
The property most affected by the cluster-centric distance is g-r colour,
closely followed by the u-r colour. These results are irrespective of the
cluster selection criteria. The two samples of clusters were identified based
on the X-ray emission and the galaxy colours, respectively. Moreover, the
parameter that best predicts environment (i.e. cluster-centric distance) is the
same found by Martinez & Muriel for groups of galaxies and Blanton at al. for
the local density of field galaxies.

for Galactic X-ray binaries. When supplemented with accurate determinations of
the component masses, orbital period, and donor effective temperature, these
kinematical constraints harbor a wealth of information on the system's past
evolution. Here, we consider all this available information to reconstruct the
full evolutionary history of the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1118+480,
assuming that the system originated in the Galactic disk and the donor has
solar metallicity. This analysis accounts for four evolutionary phases: mass
transfer through the ongoing X-ray phase, tidal evolution before the onset of
Roche-lobe overflow, motion through the Galactic potential after the formation
of the black hole, and binary orbital dynamics due to explosive mass loss and
possibly a black hole natal kick at the time of core collapse. We find that
right after black hole formation, the system consists of a ~6.0-10.0 solar
masses black hole and a ~1.0-1.6 solar masses main-sequence star. We also find
that that an asymmetric natal kick is not only plausible but required for the
formation of this system, and derive a lower and upper limit on the black hole
natal kick velocity magnitude of 80 km/s and 310 km/s, respectively.
