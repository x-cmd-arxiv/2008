under the assumption that no beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles are
being produced near their mass shell. A violation of these limits would
constitute a smoking gun for light BSM particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how R_T, the ratio of the partially integrated Higgs transverse momentum
distribution to the inclusive rate, can also be used as a probe of light BSM
particles. This ratio is insensitive to heavy virtual effects and can be
well-approximated by its SM value, i.e. it is model independent. The
perturbative expansion for R_T has reduced renormalization scale dependence, at
the order of 5% at next-to-leading order in QCD, due to a cancellation of
Wilson coefficients. A deviation from the SM value implies that light BSM
particles are being produced near their mass shell. We discuss a possible
loophole to this conclusion, namely the existence of a non-perturbative, CP
violating sector that couples to the Higgs. We use a toy model with colored
scalars to demonstrate how the model independent prediction for R_T is
approached as the mass of the scalar becomes large.

with infrared photometric data from the Spitzer space telescope archive. The
relevant physical properties of CB230-A were constrained by SED fitting of

of atomic and molecular emission and absorption features. The characteristics
of this spectrum suggest that we are observing a region in the close vicinity
of CB230-A, i. e. its photosphere and/or an active accretion disk. The spectra
of the knots in the jet contain a large number of emission lines, including a
rich set of [FeII] lines. Emission due to H2 and [FeII] are not spatially
correlated, confirming that [FeII] and H2 are excited by different mechanisms,
in agreement with the models where [FeII] traces dissociative J-shocks and
molecular hydrogen traces slower C-shocks. By using intensity ratios involving
density-sensitive [FeII] lines, we estimated the electron densities in the jet
(6x10^3-1x10^4 cm^-3). This indicates either high density post-shock regions of
ionised gas or regions with a high degree of ionisation. By combining the
present data with previously obtained maps at NIR- and mm-wavelengths, the
emerging scenario is that CB230-A is a Class 0/I YSO driving an atomic jet that
is observed to be almost monopolar probably due to its inclination to the plane
of the sky and the resulting higher extinction of its red side. This jet
appears energetic enough to drive the molecular outflow observed in the mm.

expected, the measurable asymmetry is rather small. High luminosity and precise
measurements of masses, branching ratios and CP asymmetries may enable
measurements of the CP-violating parameters in cascade decays at the LHC.

the implications of these observations in the context of models for the jet
X-ray emission. By relaxing the assumption of equipartition, we undertake an
exhaustive study of the parameter space for external Compton off the CMB
(EC/CMB) model. We find that the multiwavelength observations exclude a
magnetic field dominated jet. Using the method proposed by Georganopoulos et
al. (2005) for probing the jet matter content we show that protons are needed
for practically all jet configurations, extending a previous application of the
method by Uchiyama et al. (2005) that was based on exploring three particular
jet configurations. We also show that equipartition is the only configuration
that can reproduce the observations and have one proton per radiating lepton.
We finally present a rather model - independent argument that the jet has a
spine-sheath flow pattern, with the spine being faster and emitting most of the
IR-optical-X-ray emission.

that of the major emission bands. Here we report a study involving both
laboratory and theoretical analysis of the fundamentals of PAH spectroscopy
that produce features in this region and use these to analyze the astronomical
spectra. The ISO SWS spectra of fifteen objects showing these PAH features were
considered for this study, of which four have sufficient S/N between 5 and 6
$\mu$m to allow for an in-depth analysis. All four astronomical spectra show
similar peak positions and profiles. The 5.25 $\mu$m feature is peaked and
asymmetric, while the 5.7 $\mu$m feature is broader and flatter. Detailed
analysis of the laboratory spectra and quantum chemical calculations show that
the astronomical 5.25 and 5.7 $\mu$m bands are a blend of combination,
difference and overtone bands primarily involving CH stretching and CH in-plane
and CH out-of-plane bending fundamental vibrations. The experimental and
computational spectra show that, of all the hydrogen adjacency classes possible
on PAHs, solo and duo hydrogens consistently produce prominent bands at the
observed positions whereas quartet hydrogens do not. In all, this a study
supports the picture that astronomical PAHs are large with compact, regular
structures. From the coupling with primarily strong CH out-of-plane bending
modes one might surmise that the 5.25 and 5.7 $\mu$m bands track the neutral
PAH population. However, theory suggests the role of charge in these
astronomical bands might also be important.

a turbulent kinetic energy equation which contains both nonlocal and time
dependent terms, and is appropriate if the convective transit time is shorter
than the evolutionary time scale. The interpretation of mixing-length theory
(MLT) as generally used in astrophysics is incorrect; MLT forces the mixing
length to be an imposed constant. Direct tests show that the damping associated
with the flow is that suggested by Kolmogorov. The eddy size is approximately
the depth of the convection zone, and this dissipation length corresponds to
the ""mixing length"". New terms involving local heating by turbulent dissipation
should appear in the stellar evolution equations. The enthalpy flux
(""convective luminosity"") is directly connected to the buoyant acceleration,
and hence the velocity scale. MLT tends to systematically underestimate this
velocity scale. Quantitative comparison with a variety of 3D simulations
reveals a previously recognized consistency. Examples of application to stellar

three components: 1) inner-shell chemical, 2) outer-shell packing, and 3)
outer-shell long-ranged contributions. In this paper, we discuss efficient
methods for computing each of the three parts of the free energy. A Bayesian
estimation approach is developed to compute the inner-shell chemical and
outer-shell packing contributions. We derive upper and lower bounds on the
outer-shell long-ranged portion of the free energy by expressing this component
in two equivalent ways. Local, high energy contacts between solute and solvent
are eliminated by spatial conditioning in this free energy piece, leading to
near-Gaussian distributions of solute-solvent interactions energies. Thus, the
average of the two mean-field bounds yields an accurate and efficient free
energy estimate. Aqueous solvation free energy results are presented for
several solutes, including methane, perfluoromethane, water, and the sodium and

methods. The approach should prove useful in computing solvation free energies

models. First, the activity in the auditory cortex is sparse, and firing rates
can be described by a lognormal distribution. Second, the distribution of
non-zero synaptic strengths between nearby cortical neurons can also be
described by a lognormal distribution. Here we use a simple model of cortical
activity to reconcile these observations. The model makes the experimentally
testable prediction that synaptic efficacies onto a given cortical neuron are
statistically correlated, i.e. it predicts that some neurons receive many more
strong connections than other neurons. We propose a simple Hebb-like learning
rule which gives rise to both lognormal firing rates and synaptic efficacies.
Our results represent a first step toward reconciling sparse activity and
sparse connectivity in cortical networks.

gradient rf and strong focusing solenoids. Experiments have shown that there
may be serious problems operating rf in the required magnetic fields. The use
of high pressure gas to avoid these problems is discussed, including possible
loss problems from electron and ion production by the passage of an ionizing
beam. It is also noted that high pressure gas cannot be used in later stages of
cooling for a muon collider. Experimental observations using vacuum rf cavities
in magnetic fields are discussed, current published models of breakdown with
and without magnetic fields are summarized, and some of their predictions
compared with observations.
  A new theory of magnetic field dependent breakdown is presented. It is
proposed that electrons emitted by field emission on asperities on one side of
a cavity are focused by the magnetic field to the other side where they melt
the cavity surface in small spots. Metal is then electrostatically drawn from
the molten spots, becomes vaporized and ionized by field emission from the
remaining damage and cause breakdown. The theory is fitted to existing 805 MHz
data and predictions are made for performance at 201 MHz. The model predicts
breakdown gradients significantly below those specified for either the
International Scoping Study (ISS) Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider.
  Possible solutions to these problems are discussed, including designs for
`magnetically insulated rf' in which the cavity walls are designed to be
parallel to a chosen magnetic field contour line and consequently damage from
field emission is suppressed. An experimental program to study these problems
and their possible solution is outlined.

photodissociation region models, we include the freezing of species, simple
grain surface chemistry, and desorption (including FUV photodesorption) of

Here, under certain conditions, gas phase elemental oxygen freezes out as water
ice and the elemental C/O abundance ratio can exceed unity, leading to complex
carbon chemistry. Gas phase H2O and O2 peak in abundance at intermediate depth
into the cloud, roughly A_V~3-8 from the surface, the depth proportional to
ln(G_0/n). Closer to the surface, molecules are photodissociated. Deeper into
the cloud, molecules freeze to grain surfaces. At intermediate depths
photodissociation rates are attenuated by dust extinction, but photodesorption
prevents total freezeout. For G_0 < 500, abundances of H2O and O2 peak at
values ~10^(-7), producing columns ~10^(15) per cm^2, independent of G_0 and n.
The peak abundances depend primarily on the product of the photodesorption
yield of water ice and the grain surface area per H nucleus. At higher values
of G_0, thermal desorption of O atoms from grains enhances the gas phase H2O
peak abundance and column slightly, whereas the gas phase O2 peak abundance
rises to ~10^(-5) and the column to ~2x10^(16) per cm^2. We present simple

broad metallicity range from [Fe/H] = -2.26 to -0.15. The RR0 stars from
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have lower average metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.55 \pm
0.02, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.25 dex, similar to that in the bulge. A
correlation between metallicity and galactocentric distance is found, in a
sense that for the metal-poor RR0 Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]< -1.5 dex), the closer a
star is to the Galactic center, on average, the more metal rich it is. However,
for the metal-rich RR0 Lyrae stars ([Fe/H] > -1.2 dex), this trend is reversed.
Using mean magnitudes of MACHO RR Lyrae stars, we searched for the evidence of
the Galactic bar, and found marginal evidence of a bar. The absence of a strong
bar indicates that the RR Lyrae in the bulge represent a different population
than the majority of the bulge stars, which are metal rich and are part of a
bar.

concerned, the SNO+ detector -- a 1 kilo-tonne liquid scintillator detector
that inherits the experimental infrastructure from the recently finished SNO
experiment -- is expected to perform just as well as the KamLAND experiment.
The most important difference between these experiments is the distribution of
nuclear reactors: whereas KamLAND has 9 nuclear reactor sites within 300 km
with a flux-averaged baseline of about 180 km, SNO+ has only 1 within 300 km,
with an average baseline of $\approx 750$ km. As a result, the reactor
anti-neutrino flux at SNO+ is only about 1/5 that at KamLAND, and the ability
of SNO+ to constrain the solar neutrino oscillation parameter is diminished by
a factor of about $\sqrt{1/5} = 1/2.2$ relative to KamLAND. In spite of this,
SNO+ has comparable sensitivity to $\Delta m^{2}_{12}$ as KamLAND because the
rate of change of the spectral distortion as a function of this parameter is
much greater than for KamLAND. In this report, this advantage is examined
quantitatively using a geometric approximation that makes clear how the shape
from SNO+ has more statistical power than that from KamLAND. This result then
is confirmed by determining the sensitivity to $\Delta m^{2}_{12}$ using an
ensemble experiment technique.

astrophysical jets from their inner parts and disk-winds are considered as the
basic component of such magnetically collimated outflows. The only available
analytical MHD solutions for describing disk-driven jets are those
characterized by the symmetry of radial self-similarity. Radially self-similar
MHD models, in general, have two geometrical shortcomings, a singularity at the
jet axis and the non-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets
formally extend to radial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary
to extend the analytical solutions towards the axis and impose a physical
boundary at finite radial distance. We focus here on studying the effects of
imposing an outer radius of the underlying accreting disk (and thus also of the
outflow) on the topology, structure and variability of a radially self-similar
analytical MHD solution. The initial condition consists of a hybrid of an
unchanged and a scaled-down analytical solution, one for the jet and the other
for its environment. In all studied cases, we find at the end steady
two-component solutions.

indicating the presence of ionized absorbing gas and a soft excess. A
broad-band fit to the EPIC and RGS spectra shows that the continuum can be well
fit with a power-law and a blackbody component. The RGS can be modeled either
with two or three absorption components. In the two absorber model the
low-ionization one, accounts for the presence of the Fe M-shell unresolved
transition array (Fe VII-XIII), and the high ionization component is required
by the presence of several Fe L-shell transitions. The data suggest the
presence of a third ionized component with higher ionization, so that the Fe
L-shell absorption features are produced by two different components (one
producing absorption by Fe XVII-XX, and the other absorption by Fe XX-XXII).
However, the presence of the third absorbing component cannot be detected by
means of an isolated absorption line in a significant way, so we consider this
detection only as tentative. Interestingly, all ionization components have
similar kinematics. In addition, whether two or three absorbers are considered,
the components appear to be in pressure balance. These results give further
support to the idea that warm absorbers in AGN consist of a two or three-phase
medium. We note that, while in the model with only two absorbers one of them
(the high ionization component) lies on an unstable branch of the thermal
equilibrium curve, in the model with three absorbers all of the components lie
on stable branches of the curve. This gives further plausibility to a
multi-phase absorber.

three qualitatively different dynamical phases for the entanglement in the long
time limit: sudden death, sudden death and revival and no-sudden death [Paz &
Roncaglia, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 220401 (2008)]. Here we generalize and extend
those results along several directions: We analyze the fate of entanglement for
an environment with a general spectral density providing a complete
characterization of the corresponding phase diagrams for ohmic and sub--ohmic
environments (we also analyze the super-ohmic case showing that for such
environment the expected behavior is rather different). We also generalize
previous studies by considering two different models for the interaction
between the system and the environment (first we analyze the case when the
coupling is through position and then we examine the case where the coupling is
symmetric in position and momentum). Finally, we analyze (both numerically and
analytically) the case of non-resonant oscillators. In that case we show that
the final entanglement is independent of the initial state and may be non-zero
at very low temperatures. We provide a natural interpretation of our results in
terms of a simple quantum optics model.

eruption of Eta Carinae, the prototype of these events, ejected about 12 solar
masses at speeds of 650 km/s, with a kinetic energy of almost 10^50 ergs. Some
faster material with speeds up to 1000-2000 km/s had previously been reported
but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much
faster material with speeds up to 3500-6000 km/s, reaching farther from the
star than the fastest material in earlier reports. This fast material roughly
doubles the kinetic energy of the 19th century event, and suggests that it
released a blast wave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. Thus, Eta
Car's outer shell now mimics a low-energy supernova remnant. The eruption has
usually been discussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's
luminosity, but fast material reported here suggests that it was powered by a
deep-seated explosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the
pulsational pair instability. This may alter interpretations of similar events

opportunistic routing in wireless mesh networks. In multirate anypath routing,
each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission rate to
reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the
set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there
is no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of next hops and the
transmission rate used by each node. We bridge this gap by introducing a
polynomial-time algorithm to this problem and provide the proof of its
optimality. The proposed algorithm runs in the same running time as regular
shortest-path algorithms and is therefore suitable for deployment in link-state
routing protocols. We conducted experiments in a 802.11b testbed network, and
our results show that multirate anypath routing performs on average 80% and up

yields a better match to the data but the improvement is not significant and
the two additional parameters which are required to describe this model are not
justified by the existing data. The extreme anisotropy we infer for the
scintillation patterns must be attributed to the scattering medium rather than
a highly elongated source. For J1819+3845 the totally anisotropic model
predicts that the particular radio flux variations seen between mid July and
late August should repeat between late August and mid November, and then again
between mid November and late December as the Earth twice changes its direction
of motion across the scintillation pattern. If this effect can be observed then
the minor-axis velocity component of the screen and the orientation of that
axis can both be precisely determined. In reality the axis ratio is finite,
albeit large, and spatial decorrelation of the flux pattern along the major
axis may be observable via differences in the pairwise fluxes within this
overlap region; in this case we can also constrain both the major-axis velocity
component of the screen and the magnitude of the anisotropy.

do not only differ from those seen in the Galaxy. They also do not form a
continuation of the trends observed with decreasing metallicity from the inner

transition zone between the inner Galaxy and the metal poor environment of the

MHD simulations of a vertically-stratified shearing box in which the ratio of
radiation to gas pressure is ~ 10, and yet no thermal runaway occurs over a
timespan ~ 40 cooling times. Where the time-averaged dissipation rate is
greater than the critical dissipation rate that creates hydrostatic equilibrium
by diffusive radiation flux, the time-averaged radiation flux is held to the
critical value, with the excess dissipated energy transported by radiative
advection. Although the stress and total pressure are well-correlated as
predicted by the alpha-model, we show that stress fluctuations precede pressure
fluctuations, contrary to the usual supposition that the pressure controls the
saturation level of the magnetic energy. This fact explains the thermal
stability. Using a simple toy-model, we show that independently-generated
magnetic fluctuations can drive radiation pressure fluctuations, creating a
correlation between the two while maintaining thermal stability.

and they proved a bound of $\poly(n^k, \sigma^{-1})$ on the smoothed
running-time of the k-means method, where n is the number of data points and
$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbation. This bound,

  We improve the smoothed analysis of the k-means method by showing two upper
bounds on the expected running-time of k-means. First, we prove that the
expected running-time is bounded by a polynomial in $n^{\sqrt k}$ and
$\sigma^{-1}$. Second, we prove an upper bound of $k^{kd} \cdot \poly(n,

independent of k and d, and we obtain a polynomial bound for the expected

cerebellar granule neurons. We also show that CGP7930, a positive allosteric
regulator specific of GABA(B2), alone can induce the phosphorylation of
ERK(1/2). PTX, a G(i/o) inhibitor, abolishes both baclofen and
CGP7930-mediated-ERK(1/2) phosphorylation. Moreover, both baclofen and CGP7930
induce ERK-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Furthermore, by using LY294002, a
PI-3 kinase inhibitor, and a C-term of GRK-2 that has been reported to
sequester Gbetagamma subunits, we demonstrate the role of Gbetagamma in GABA(B)
receptor-mediated-ERK(1/2) phosphorylation. In conclusion, the activation of
GABA(B) receptor leads to ERK(1/2) phosphorylation via the coupling of GABA(B2)
to G(i/o) and by releasing Gbetagamma subunits which in turn induce the
activation of CREB. These findings suggest a role of GABA(B) receptor in
long-term change in the central nervous system.

radius as a function of charges. The entropy of new dyonic black holes
interpolates between the Bekenstein-Hawking value in the limit of the large

this value for the vanishing magnetic charge. Although an expression for the
entropy can be obtained analytically using purely local near-horizon solutions,
its interpretation as the black hole entropy is legitimate only once the global
black hole solution is known to exist, and we obtain numerically the
corresponding conditions on the parameters. Thus, a purely local analysis is
insufficient to fully understand the entropy of the curvature corrected black

photometry plays an important role for different applications. In particular,
long-baseline interferometry, gravitational microlensing, extrasolar planet
transits, and many other observing techniques require accurate predictions of
the angular size of stars. These predictions are based on the surface
brightness-colour (SBC) relations. Aims: Our goal is to calibrate
general-purpose SBC relations using visible colours, the most commonly
available data for most stars. Methods: We compiled the existing long-baseline
interferometric observations of nearby dwarf and subgiant stars and the
corresponding broadband photometry in the Johnson B V and Cousins Rc Ic bands.
We then adjusted polynomial SBC models to these data. Results: Due to the
presence of spectral features that depend on the effective temperature, the SBC
relations are usually not linear for visible colours. We present polynomial
fits that can be employed with BVRcIc based colours to predict the
limb-darkened angular diameters (i.e. photospheric) of dwarf and subgiant stars
with a typical accuracy of 5%. Conclusions: The derived polynomial relations
provide a satisfactory approximation to the observed surface brightness of
nearby dwarfs and subgiants. For distant stars, the interstellar reddening
should be taken into account, and will usually introduce an additional
uncertainty to the predicted angular diameters.

steep decline at larger z. Less than half of these mergers are between two

candidates for the origin of tidal features around red elliptical galaxies. The
introduction of a transition mass scale for star formation has a strong impact
on the evolution of galaxies, allowing them to grow above a characteristic mass

suggest that it is possible to detect the existence of a transition mass scale

(which we dubbed ""crazy diamond"") carried out on November 2007 by means of the
astrophysical satellites AGILE, INTEGRAL, Swift, the WEBT Consortium, and the
optical-NIR telescope REM. 3C 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ level
during the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 MeV of
$F_{\rm E>100MeV} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. The gamma-ray
spectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\Gamma_{\rm
GRID} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 MeV and 1 GeV. We detect significant
day-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, and
we can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)
level. The source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it was
substantially off--axis in the field of view of the AGILE hard X-ray imager.
However, a 5-day long ToO observation by INTEGRAL detected 3C 454.3 at an
average flux of about $F_{\rm 20-200 keV} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec with
an average photon index of $\Gamma_{\rm IBIS} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200
keV. Swift also detected 3C 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 keV energy band in
the range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in the
range $\Gamma_{\rm XRT} = 1.56-1.73$. In the optical band, both WEBT and REM
show an extremely variable behavior in the $R$ band. A correlation analysis
based on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between the
gamma-ray and the optical flux variations. Our simultaneous multifrequency
observations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30
MeV and 30 GeV is dominated by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic
electrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

into the slot due to gravity. Many thought experiments have been conducted
where the presence of gravity is eliminated with the rod and slot approaching
each other along a line joining their centers, whereby the considerations come
strictly under Special Relativity. In these experiments the line of motion is
not parallel to either the axis of the rod or the slot. In this paper we
consider in detail the two cases when the rod does fall into the slot and when
the rod does not fall into the slot, each from the perspective of the co-moving
frames of the rod and the slot. We show that whether the rod falls into the
slot as determined by Galilean kinematics is also valid under relativistic
kinematics; this determination does not depend upon the magnitude of the
velocity, but only on the proper lengths and the proper angles of the rod and
slot with the line of motion. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that the
passing (or crashing) of the rod as a wholesome event is unaffected by
relativistic kinematics. We also provide a simple formula to determine whether
or not the rod passes through the slot.

conformational change and elongates roughly twice its initial contour length at
a pulling force about 70 pN. The transition to this highly overstretched form
of DNA is very cooperative. Applying force perpendicular to the DNA axis
(unzipping), double-strand DNA can also be separated into two single-stranded
DNA which is a fundamental process in DNA replication. We study the DNA
overstretching and unzipping transition using fully atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and argue that the conformational changes of double
strand DNA associated with either of the above mentioned processes can be
viewed as force induced DNA melting. As the force at one end of the DNA is
increased the DNA start melting abruptly/smoothly after a critical force
depending on the pulling direction. The critical force fm, at which DNA melts
completely decreases as the temperature of the system is increased. The melting
force in case of unzipping is smaller compared to the melting force when the
DNA is pulled along the helical axis. In the cases of melting through
unzipping, the double-strand separation has jumps which correspond to the
different energy minima arising due to different base pair sequence. The
fraction of Watson-Crick base pair hydrogen bond breaking as a function of

1325 images over 58 nights. They are found to be 0.36 in U-band, 0.21 in
B-band, 0.12 in V-band, 0.09 in R-band and 0.05 in I-band. On average,
extinction during the summer months is slightly larger than that during the

low-luminosity AGN operates as in their luminous counterparts. We used archival
XMM-Newton and, in two cases, ASCA data to estimate their X-ray variability
amplitude and determine their X-ray spectral shape and luminosity. We also used
archival HST data to measure their optical nuclear luminosity, and near-IR
measurements from the literature, in order to construct their near-IR to X-ray
spectra. The X-ray variability amplitude of the four Seyferts is what one would
expect, given their black hole masses. Their near-IR to X-ray spectrum has the
same shape as the spectrum of quasars which are 10^2-10^5 times more luminous.
The objects in our sample are optically classified as Seyfert 1-1.5. This
implies that they host a relatively unobscured AGN-like nucleus. They are also
of low luminosity and accrete at a low rate. They are therefore good candidates
to detect radiation from an inefficient accretion process. However, our results
suggest that they are similar to AGN which are 10^2-10^5 times more luminous.
The combination of a ""radiative efficient accretion disc plus an X-ray
producing hot corona"" may persist at low accretion rates as well.

simulations with radiative cooling of jet models with parameters representative
of the symbiotic system MWC 560. These were jet simulations of a pulsed,
initially underdense jet in a high-density ambient medium. They were stopped
when the jet reached a length of 50 AU. There, however, a transition of the
initially underdense jet towards an overdense jet should occur, which should
result in changed kinematics. Therefore, we describe two hydrodynamical
simulations with cooling beyond this density balance, one with the same
parameters as model i in Paper I (now called model i'), which was presented
there with and without cooling, and the second with higher gas densities in the
jet pulses (model iv'). Hydrodynamical simulations, with a further approximated
cooling treatment compared to Paper I, were used to be able to enlarge the
computational domain. The transition causes changes in the expansion of the
cocoon and therefore the morphology of the jet, e.g. a larger radial width of
the jet knots. We investigate the radiation properties of the jets, the
bremsstrahlung and optical emissivities, integrated emission maps, and
synthetic absorption line profiles. The conclusion that the high observed
velocities in CH Cygni, R Aquarii, and MWC 560 favor the models with cooling is
unchanged by the transition. The observed parallel features in R Aquarii can be
produced by the internal knots or by a variable dense radiative shell of
shocked ambient medium. The absorption line profiles show that the real
parameters in MWC 560 are closer to model iv' than to model i'.

algebra. We evaluate the corresponding Faddeev-Popov determinants, resolve
Gauss' law and derive the Hamiltonians, which differ in both gauges due to
additional zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov kernel in the pure Coulomb gauge. By
Gauss' law the zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov kernel constrain the physical
wave functionals to zero colour charge states. We solve the Schroedinger

The gluon and ghost propagators and the static colour Coulomb potential are

region, and Gribov copy effects are studied. We explicitly demonstrate that the
Dyson-Schwinger equations do not specify the Gribov region while the
propagators and vertices do depend on the Gribov region chosen. In this sense,
the Dyson-Schwinger equations alone do not provide the full non-abelian quantum
gauge theory, but subsidiary conditions must be required. Implications of
Gribov copy effects for lattice calculations of the infrared behaviour of
gauge-fixed propagators are discussed. We compute the ghost-gluon vertex and
provide a sensible truncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Approximations of

(viz., DDO 68, SDSS J2104-0035 and UGC 772) of the six most metal-deficient
actively star-forming galaxies known. Although there is a debate as to whether
these galaxies are undergoing their first episode of star formation or not,
they are `young' in the sense that their ISM is chemically unevolved. In this
regard, they are the nearest equivalents of young galaxies in the early
Universe. All three galaxies, that we have observed, have irregular HI
morphologies and kinematics, which we interpret as either due to tidal
interaction with neighbouring galaxies, or the consequences of a recent merger.
The remaining three of the six most metal-deficient galaxies are also known to
have highly disturbed HI distributions and are interacting. It is interesting
because these galaxies were chosen solely on the basis of their metallicity and
not for any particular signs of interaction. In this sense (i.e., their gas has
not yet had time to settle into a regular disc), one could regard these
extremely metal deficient (XMD) galaxies as `young'. The current star formation
episode is likely to have been triggered by interaction/merger. It is also
possible that the tidal interaction has lead to enhanced mixing with metal-poor
gas in outer disc, and hence to a low gas-phase metallicity in the central
star-forming regions. We also find that in general these galaxies do not show a
one-to-one correspondence between regions of high HI column density and regions
with current star formation. However, to the extent that one can define a
threshold density, its value (~10^{21} atoms cm^{-2}) is similar to that in
galaxies with much higher metallicity.

  Methods:We observed the galaxy with integral field spectroscopy (VLT/VIMOS,

Gaussian functions to the O[III] and Hbeta emission lines, and fit stellar
templates to the galaxy spectra to determine velocity and velocity dispersions.
We modeled the stellar kinematics in the bulge with spherical isotropic Jeans
models and explored the implications of self consistent and dark matter
scenarios for NFW and pseudo isothermal halos.
  Results:In the bulge-dominated region, r<5"", the emission lines show
multi-peaked profiles. The disk dominated region of the galaxy, 13""<r<30"",
exhibits regular rotation, with a flat rotation curve that reaches 248 +/- 6
km/sec. From this we estimate the total barionic mass to be M_bar ~ 1.9 10^11
M_sun and the total DM halo mass to be M_DM ~ 4.8 10^12 M_sun. The stellar
velocity and velocity dispersion have been measured only in the innermost ~5""
of the bulge, and reveal a regular rotation with an observed amplitude of 140
km/sec and a central dispersion of sigma=180 km/sec. Our simple Jeans modeling
shows that dark matter is needed in the central 5"" to explain the kinematics of
the bulge, for which we estimate a mass of (7 +/- 3) 10^10 M_sun. However, we
are not able to disentangle different DM scenarios. The computed central mass
density of the bulge of ESO 323-G064 resembles the central mass density of some

regard the interfaces separating domains as moving independently. While this is

therefore be considered as a first-order approximation for the distributions.
In contrast to the celebrated Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner distribution of
structures of the minority phase in the limit of very small concentration, the
distribution of domain areas in the 50:50 case does not have a cut-off. Large
structures (areas or perimeters) retain the morphology of a percolative or
critical initial condition, for quenches from high temperatures or the critical
point respectively. The corresponding distributions are described by a $c
A^{-\tau}$ tail, where $c$ and $\tau$ are exactly known. With increasing time,
small structures tend to have a spherical shape with a smooth surface before
evaporating by diffusion. In this regime the number density of domains with
area $A$ scales as $A^{1/2}$, as in the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. The
threshold between the small and large regimes is determined by the
characteristic area, ${\rm A} \sim [\lambda(T) t]^{2/3}$. Finally, we study the

films of a simple fluid made of quasi-spherical molecules

retains its tendency to organize into layers parallel to the confining
surfaces, and (ii) flow resistance in such layered films can be described by
bulklike viscous forces if one accounts for the existence of one monolayer
immobilized on each surfaces. The latter result is fully consistent with the
recent work of Becker and Mugele, who reached a similar conclusion by analyzing
the dynamics of squeeze-out fronts in OMCTS [T. Becker and F. Mugele, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 91} 166104(2003)]. Furthermore, we show that the confinement
rate controls the nature of the thinning transitions: layer-by-layer expulsion
of molecules in metastable, slowly confined films proceeds by a
nucleation/growth mechanism, whereas deeply and rapidly quenched films are
unstable and undergo thinning transitions akin to spinodal decomposition.

drug users who use injections. We then proceed to an asymptotic analysis (large
initial population) and show that the Markov process is close to the solution
of a non linear autonomous differential system. We prove both a law of large
numbers and functional central limit theorem to precise the speed of
convergence towards the limiting system. The deterministic system itself
converges, as time goes to infinity, to an equilibrium point. This corroborates
the empirical observations about the prevalence of HCV.

much brighter suns. Static and slowly-evolving aberrations are the limiting
factors, even after application of adaptive optics. The residual speckle
pattern is highly symmetrical due to diffraction from the telescope's aperture.
We suggest to break this symmetry and thus to locate planets hidden beneath it.
An eccentric pupil mask is rotated to modulate the residual light pattern not
removed by other means. This modulation is then exploited to reveal the
planet's constant signal. In well-corrected ground-based observations we can
reach planets six stellar magnitudes fainter than their sun, and only 2-3 times
the diffraction limit from it. At ten times the diffraction limit, we detect
planets 16 magnitudes fainter. The stellar background drops by five magnitudes.

of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, in the particular case of sets
generated by bivariate polynomials of degree four. Conditions are given for the
convex hull of a plane quartic to be exactly semidefinite representable with at
most 12 lifting variables. If the quartic is rationally parametrizable, an
exact semidefinite representation with 2 lifting variables can be obtained.
Various numerical examples illustrate the techniques and suggest further
research directions.

standard deviation of the Standard Model background at the LHC with $100

energy signal from the production of U(1) gauge boson in association with a
U(1) spinless adjoint. With proper choice of beam polarization, signal strength
is greater than $5\sigma$ standard deviation of the Standard Model background
almost upto the kinematic limit of the collider.

maximal distance, where the distance between two linear extensions L_1, L_2 is
the number of pairs of elements of P appearing in different orders in L_1 and
L_2. A diametral pair maximizes the distance among all pairs of linear
extensions of P. Felsner and Reuter defined the linear extension diameter of P
as the distance between a diametral pair of linear extensions.
  We show that computing the linear extension diameter is NP-complete in
general, but can be solved in polynomial time for posets of width 3.
  Felsner and Reuter conjectured that, in every diametral pair, at least one of
the linear extensions reverses a critical pair. We construct a counterexample
to this conjecture. On the other hand, we show that a slightly stronger
property holds for many classes of posets: We call a poset ""diametrally
reversing"" if, in every diametral pair, both linear extensions reverse a
critical pair. Among other results we show that interval orders and 3-layer
posets are diametrally reversing. From the latter it follows that almost all
posets are diametrally reversing.

compensate nonlinear distortions of the longitudinal phase space due to the
sinusoidal curvature of the the cavity voltage of the TESLA 1.3GHz cavities.
Higher order modes (HOMs) in the 3.9GHz have a significant impact on the
dynamics of the electron bunches in a long bunch train. Kicks due to dipole
modes can be enhanced along the bunch train depending on the frequency and
Q-value of the modes. The enhancement factor for a constant beam offset with
respect to the cavity has been calculated. A simple Monte Carlo model of these
effects, allowing for scatter in HOM frequencies due to manufacturing
variances, has also been implemented and results for both FLASH and for an
XFEL-like configuration are presented.
