Standard Model over which quark masses vary. We allow as many as three quarks
to participate in nuclei, while fixing the mass of the electron and the average
mass of the lightest baryon flavor multiplet. We classify as ""congenial"" worlds
that satisfy the environmental constraint that the quark masses allow for
stable nuclei with charges one, six, and eight, making organic chemistry
possible. Whether a congenial world actually produces observers depends on a
multitude of historical contingencies, beginning with primordial
nucleosynthesis, which we do not explore. Such constraints may be independently
superimposed on our results. Environmental constraints such as the ones we
study may be combined with information about the a priori distribution of quark
masses over the landscape of possible universes to determine whether the
measured values of the quark masses are determined environmentally, but our
analysis is independent of such an anthropic approach.
  We estimate baryon masses as functions of quark masses and nuclear masses as
functions of baryon masses. We check for the stability of nuclei against
fission, strong particle emission, and weak nucleon emission. For two light
quarks with charges 2/3 and -1/3, we find a band of congeniality roughly 29 MeV
wide in their mass difference. We also find another, less robust region of
congeniality with one light, charge -1/3 quark, and two heavier, approximately
degenerate charge -1/3 and 2/3 quarks. No other assignment of light quark
charges yields congenial worlds with two baryons participating in nuclei. We
identify and discuss the region in quark-mass space where nuclei would be made
from three or more baryon species.

electroweak scale induced by top condensation. The standard model field
content, without the Higgs, is promoted to a 5D warped background. There is
also an additional 5D fermion with the quantum numbers of the right-handed top.
Localization of the zero-modes leads, at low energies, to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model that also stabilizes the radion field dynamically thus explaining the
hierarchy between the Planck scale and v_EW = 174 GeV. The top mass arises
dynamically from the electroweak breaking condensate. The other standard model
fermion masses arise naturally from higher-dimension operators, and the fermion
mass hierarchies and flavor structure can be explained from the localization of
the zero-modes in the extra dimension. If any other contributions to the radion
potential except those directly related with electroweak symmetry breaking are
engineered to be suppressed, the KK scale is predicted to be about two orders
of magnitude above the electroweak scale rendering the model easily consistent
with electroweak precision data. The model predicts a heavy (composite) Higgs
with a mass of about 500 GeV and standard-model-like properties, and a
vector-like quark with non-negligible mixing with the top quark and mass in the
1.6 - 2.9 TeV range. Both can be within the reach of the LHC. It also predicts
a radion with a mass of a few GeV that is very weakly coupled to standard model

directly influences the gravitational deflection of light. We place this
problem in a cosmological context, deriving an expression for the linear

no explicit dependence on the cosmological constant. To explore the physical
origins of the apparent Lambda-dependent potential that appears in the static
Kottler metric, we highlight the two classical effects which lead to the
aberration of light. The first relates to the observer's motion relative to the
source, and encapsulates the familiar concept of angular-diameter distance. The
second term, which has proved to be the source of debate, arises from cosmic
acceleration, but is rarely considered since it vanishes for photons with
radial motion. This apparent form of light-bending gives the appearance of
curved geodesics even within a flat and homogeneous universe. However this
cannot be construed as a real lensing effect, since its value depends on the
observer's frame of reference. Our conclusion is thus that standard results for
gravitational lensing in a universe containing Lambda do not require
modification, with any influence of Lambda being restricted to negligible
high-order terms.

from an earlier result of Creignou and Hermann which gave a counting dichotomy

These can be regarded as density fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. We
assume a linear dispersion relation with a fixed speed of sound and calculate
the density correlation function. We note that this function has the same form
as the correlation function for the time derivative of a relativistic massless
scalar field, but with the speed of light replaced by the speed of sound. As a
result, the study of density fluctuations in a fluid can be a useful analog
model for better understanding fluctuations in relativistic quantum field
theory. We next calculate the differential cross section for light scattering
by the zero point density fluctuations, and find a result proportional to the
fifth power of the light frequency. This can be understood as the product of
fourth power dependence of the usual Rayleigh cross section with the linear
frequency dependence of the spectrum of zero point density fluctuations. We
give some estimates of the relative magnitude of this effect compared to the
scattering by thermal density fluctuations, and find that it can be of order
0.5% for water at room temperature and optical frequencies. This relative
magnitude is proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to
temperature. Although the scattering by zero point density fluctuation is
small, it may be observable.

evolution can be so great that it controls the planet's physical properties and

evolves due to tides. Current values depend sensitively on the physical

tidal effects may introduce observational biases in transit surveys, which may

noncritical behaviors. Inside the core of the soliton the logarithmic increase
of the entropy is faster than the universal increase of a critical field,
whereas outside the core the entropy decreases and saturates the constant value
of the corresponding massive noncritical field. In addition, two solitons
manifest long-range entanglement that decreases with the separation of the
solitons more slowly than the universal decrease of the critical field.
Interestingly, in the noncritical regime of the Frenkel-Kontorova model,
entanglement can even increase with the separation of the solitons. We show
that most of the entanglement of the so-called internal modes of the solitons
is saturated by local degrees of freedom inside the core, and therefore we

for two-dimensional lattice model. First of all, it is found that the
inhomogeneity having the form of atomic-scale regions of enhanced pair
interaction increases the ratio of the local low-temperature gap in
differential conductance spectra to the local temperature of vanishing the gap
$2\Delta_g/T_p$. Even in the framework of mean-field treatment this ratio is
shown to be larger than the one corresponding to the homogeneous case. It is
shown that the effect of thermal phase fluctuations of the superconducting
order parameter can further increase this ratio. Taking them into account in
the framework of a toy model we obtained the ratio $2\Delta_g/T_p$ to be $\sim
7-8$. It is found that the additional atomic-scale hopping element disorder and
weak potential scatterers, which can also take place in cuprate materials, have
no considerable effect on the statistical properties of the system, including
the distribution of the gaps, $T_p$ and the ratio $2\Delta_g/T_p$. The second
consequence of the atomic-scale order parameter inhomogeneity is the
anticorrelation between the low-temperature gap and the high-temperature
zero-bias conductance. The obtained results could bear a relation to recent STM
measurements.

and Rayleigh scattering recently published for this exoplanet atmosphere, an
extra absorber of uncertain origin, redward of the sodium lines, resides in the
atmosphere of the planet. Furthermore, this planet has a stratosphere
experiencing a thermal inversion caused by the capture of optical stellar flux
by absorbers that resides at altitude. Recent models have predicted that the
presence of TiO and VO in the atmosphere of HD209458b may be responsible for
this temperature inversion. Although no specific TiO and VO spectral band head
signatures have been identified unambiguously in the observed spectrum, we
suggest here that the opacities of those molecules are possible candidates to
explain the remaining continuous broad band absorption observed between 6200

VO molecules are evaluated from ten to one thousand times below solar. This
upper limit result is in agreement with expected variations with altitude due

Sky Survey (SDSS) has been a long-standing problem. The g,r,i colors of LRGs
are inconsistent with stellar population models over the redshift range
0.1<z<0.7. The g-r colors in the models are on average redder than the data
while the r-i colors in the models are bluer towards low redshift. Beyond
redshift 0.4, the predicted r-i color becomes instead too red, while the
predicted g-r agrees with the data. We provide a solution to this problem,
through a combination of new astrophysics and a fundamental change to the
stellar population modeling. We find that the use of the empirical library of
Pickles (1998) instead of theoretical spectra modifies the predicted colors
exactly in the way suggested by the data. The reason is a lower flux in the
empirical libraries, with respect to the theoretical ones, in the wavelength
range 5500-6500 AA. The discrepancy increases with decreasing effective
temperature independently of gravity. This result has general implications for
a variety of studies from globular clusters to high-redshift galaxies. The
astrophysical part of our solution regards the composition of the stellar
populations of these massive Luminous Red Galaxies. We find that on top of the
previous effect one needs to consider a model in which ~3% of the stellar mass
is in old metal-poor stars. Other solutions such as substantial blue Horizontal
Branch at high metallicity or young stellar populations can be ruled out by the
data. Our new model provides a better fit to the g-r and r-i colors of LRGs and
gives new insight into the formation histories of these most massive galaxies.
Our model will also improve the k- and evolutionary corrections for LRGs which
are critical for fully exploiting present and future galaxy surveys.

most of these luminous red galaxies (LRGs) are central galaxies residing in
massive halos of typical mass M ~ a few times 10^13 to 10^14 Msun/h, while a
few percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce the
strong auto-correlations exhibited on smaller scales. The mean luminosity Lc of
central LRGs increases with the host halo mass, with a rough scaling relation
of Lc \propto M^0.5. The halo mass required to host on average one satellite
LRG above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than that
required to host a central LRG above the same threshold. We find that in
massive halos the distribution of L* galaxies roughly follows that of the dark
matter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as M^1.5. The HOD
modeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of the
scale-dependent luminosity dependence of the cross-correlation between LRGs and
L_* galaxies. Constraints on the LRG HOD provide tests to models of formation
and evolution of massive galaxies, and they are also useful for cosmological
parameter investigations. In one of the appendices, we provide LRG HOD
parameters with dependence on cosmology inferred from modeling the two-point
auto-correlation functions of LRGs.

including detailed consideration of the velocity and density profiles of dark

elliptical rather than circular orbits. If there is a spike of dark matter
induced by the supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre, single
solar-mass stars following orbits with periods as long as 50 years and
eccentricities as low as 0.9 could be significantly affected. Binary systems
with similar periods about the Galactic centre could be affected on even less
eccentric orbits. The most striking evidence of this scenario would be the
existence of a binary consisting of a low-mass protostar and a higher-mass
evolved star. The observation of low-mass stars and/or binaries on such orbits
would either provide a detection of WIMP dark matter, or place stringent limits
on the combination of the WIMP mass, spin-dependent nuclear-scattering
cross-section, halo density and velocity distribution near the Galactic centre.
In some cases, the limits on the WIMP mass and spin-dependent
nuclear-scattering cross-section would be of comparable sensitivity to current
direct-detection experiments.

detect the progenitor star or to constrain its properties. Following image
registration, we find that an isolated stellar object is not detected at the

I-band image obtained with the Wide-Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board the
Hubble Space Telescope, the offset between the SN 2006my location and a
detected source (""Source 1"") is too large: > 0.08"", which corresponds to a
confidence level of non-association of 96% from our most liberal estimates of
the transformation and measurement uncertainties. In the second, a similarly
obtained V-band image, a source is detected (""Source 2"") that has overlap with
the SN 2006my location but is definitively an extended object. Through
artificial star tests carried out on the precise location of SN 2006my in the
images, we derive a 3-sigma upper bound on the luminosity of a red supergiant

which translates to an upper bound on such a star's initial mass of 15 M_Sun
from the STARS stellar evolutionary models. Although considered unlikely, we
can not rule out the possibility that part of the light comprising Source 1,
which exhibits a slight extension relative to other point sources in the image,
or part of the light contributing to the extended Source 2, may be due to the
progenitor of SN 2006my. Only additional, high-resolution observations of the

inspiralling and mass-transferring double white dwarf (DWD) systems in the
distance independent ""absolute"" amplitude-frequency domain of the proposed
space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector, {\it LISA}. The degenerate zero
temperature mass-radius (M-R) relationship of individual white dwarf stars that
we assumed, in combination with the constraints imposed by Roche geometries,
permits us to identify five key population boundaries for DWD systems in
various phases of evolution. Here we use the non-zero entropy donor M-R
relations of \cite{DB2003} to modify these boundaries for both DWD and neutron
star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems. We find that the mass-transferring
systems occupy a larger fraction of space in ``absolute'' amplitude-frequency
domain compared to the simpler T=0 donor model. We also discuss how these
boundaries are modified with the new evolutionary phases found by
\cite{Deloyeetal2007}. In the initial contact phase, we find that the contact
boundaries, which are the result of end of inspiral evolution, would have some
width, as opposed to an abrupt cut-off described in our earlier T=0 model. This
will cause an overlap between a DWDs $&$ NSWDs evolutionary trajectories,
making them indistinguishable with only LISA observations within this region.
In the cooling phase of the donor, which follows after the adiabatic donor
evolution, the radius contracts, mass-transfer rate drops and slows down the
orbital period evolution. Depending upon the entropy of the donor, these
systems may then lie inside the fully degenerate T=0 boundaries, but LISA may
be unable to detect these systems as they might be below the sensitivity limit
or within the unresolved DWD background noise.

space for keywords in sponsored search auctions so as to maximize revenue, most
of which assume that pricing is done via a first-price auction. This does not
realistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in
practice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they are
allocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, we
introduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are
determined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of the
Second-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the more
studied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant,
for which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard to
approximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor,
even when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancy
extends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching
problem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no
deterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no
randomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This
contrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-price
model, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial
time and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving
better competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation
for offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.
The latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on the

with limited range multi-modal sensors. Limited range sensing environment
arises in a sensing field prone to signal attenuation and path losses. The
general problem complements the widely considered decentralized detection
problem where all sensors observe the same object. In this paper we develop a
distributed detection approach based on recent development of the false
discovery rate (FDR) and the associated BH test procedure. The BH procedure is
based on rank ordering of scalar test statistics. We first develop scalar test
statistics for multidimensional data to handle multi-modal sensor observations
and establish its optimality in terms of the BH procedure. We then propose a
distributed algorithm in the ideal case of infinite attenuation for
identification of sensors that are in the immediate vicinity of an object. We
demonstrate communication message scalability to large SNETs by showing that
the upper bound on the communication message complexity scales linearly with
the number of sensors that are in the vicinity of objects and is independent of
the total number of sensors in the SNET. This brings forth an important
principle for evaluating the performance of an SNET, namely, the need for
scalability of communications and performance with respect to the number of
objects or events in an SNET irrespective of the network size. We then account
for finite attenuation by modeling sensor observations as corrupted by
uncertain interference arising from distant objects and developing robust
extensions to our idealized distributed scheme. The robustness properties
ensure that both the error performance and communication message complexity
degrade gracefully with interference.

infrastructureless networks where each node adjusts locally its physical and

remain open. The first is the optimality. The second is the complexity. We
study these issues through modeling, analysis, and randomized distributed

probabilistic model for a network configuration which characterizes jointly the
statistical spatial dependence of a physical- and a logical-configuration. We
then show that a local model which approximates the global model is a two-layer
Markov Random Field or a random bond model. The complexity of the local model
is the communication range among nodes. The local model is near-optimal when
the approximation error to the global model is within a given error bound. We
analyze the trade-off between an approximation error and complexity, and derive
sufficient conditions on the near-optimality of the local model. We validate
the model, the analysis and the randomized distributed algorithms also through

Starting from a stability analysis and from the exact solutions for a standard

the use of internal transformations two new kinds of tachyon fields are derived

determined and it is shown that the standard and complementary tachyon fields
reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM model as a limiting case. The standard tachyon
field can also describe a transition from an accelerated to a decelerated
regime, behaving as an inflaton field at early times and as a matter field at
late times. The complementary tachyon field always behaves as a matter field.
The phantom tachyon field is characterized by a rapid expansion where its

related ligand-receptor systems differing by a few well-defined atoms. Second,
improvement of computer power and simulation techniques allowed extended
exploration of the interaction of realistic macromolecules. Third, simultaneous
development of a variety of techniques based on atomic force microscopy,
hydrodynamic flow, biomembrane probes, optical tweezers, magnetic fields or
flexible transducers yielded direct experimental information of the behavior of

inherent in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. As the typical
detectors used in Monte Carlo simulations do not take into account all the
information contained in the impacting photon packages, there is still room to
optimize this detection process and the corresponding estimate of the surface
brightness distributions. We want to investigate how all the information
contained in the distribution of impacting photon packages can be optimally
used to decrease the noise in the surface brightness distributions and hence to
increase the efficiency of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.
  We demonstrate that the estimate of the surface brightness distribution in a
Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulation is similar to the estimate of the
density distribution in an SPH simulation. Based on this similarity, a recipe
is constructed for smart detectors that take full advantage of the exact
location of the impact of the photon packages. Several types of smart
detectors, each corresponding to a different smoothing kernel, are presented.
We show that smart detectors, while preserving the same effective resolution,
reduce the noise in the surface brightness distributions compared to the
classical detectors. The most efficient smart detector realizes a noise
reduction of about 10%, which corresponds to a reduction of the required number
of photon packages (i.e. a reduction of the simulation run time) of 20%. As the
practical implementation of the smart detectors is straightforward and the
additional computational cost is completely negligible, we recommend the use of
smart detectors in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.

observations at |b|>20 deg covering a sky area of 132.3 deg^2 to compile the
largest complete samples of X-ray objects to date in the 0.5-1 keV, 1-2 keV,
2-4.5 keV, 4.5-10 keV, 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV energy bands. Our survey includes
in excess of 30,000 sources down to ~10^-15 erg/cm^2/s below 2 keV and down to
~10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s above 2 keV. A break in the source count distributions was
detected in all energy bands except the 4.5-10 keV band. An analytical model
comprising 2 power-law components cannot adequately describe the curvature seen
in the source count distributions. The shape of the logN(>S)-logS is strongly
dependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move to
higher energies. This is due to non-AGN populations, comprised mainly of stars
and clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population at
energies <2 keV and at fluxes >10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations of
objects have significantly flatter source count distributions than AGN. We find
a substantial increase in the relative fraction of hard X-ray sources at higher
energies, from >55% below 2 keV to >77% above 2 keV. However the majority of
sources detected above 4.5 keV still have significant flux below 2 keV.
Comparison with predictions from the synthesis models suggest that the models
might be overpredicting the number of faint absorbed AGN, which would call for
fine adjustment of some model parameters such as the obscured to unobscured AGN
ratio and/or the distribution of column densities at intermediate obscuration.

predominant when both the warm and cold components of the ISM are effectively
stable to gravitational instabilities. In this case, the spacing (and
consequently mass) of clouds and spurs along the spiral arms is determined by
the orbits of the gas particles and correlates with their epicyclic radii (or
equivalently spiral shock strength). Notably GMCs formed primarily by
agglomeration tend to be unbound associations of many smaller clouds, which
disperse upon leaving the spiral arms. These GMCs are likely to be more massive
in galaxies with stronger spiral shocks or higher surface densities. GMCs
formed by agglomeration are also found to exhibit both prograde and retrograde
rotation, a consequence of the clumpiness of the gas. At higher surface
densities, self gravity becomes more important in arranging both the warm and
cold gas into clouds and spurs, and determining the properties of the most
massive GMCs. These massive GMCs can be distinguished by their higher angular
momentum, exhibit prograde rotation and are more bound. For a 20 M$_{\odot}$

evolution of structure within these galaxies, the $Q$-parameter and the
two-point correlation function (TPCF). In both galaxies we find the stars are
born with a high degree of substructure (i.e. are highly fractal) and that the
stellar distribution approaches that of the 'background' population on
timescales similar to the crossing times of the galaxy (~80/150 Myr for the
SMC/LMC respectively). By comparing our observations to simple models of
structural evolution we find that 'popping star clusters' do not significantly
influence structural evolution in these galaxies. Instead we argue that general
galactic dynamics are the main drivers, and that substructure will be erased in
approximately the crossing time, regardless of spatial scale, from small
clusters to whole galaxies. This can explain why many young Galactic clusters
have high degrees of substructure, while others are smooth and centrally
concentrated. We conclude with a general discussion on cluster 'infant

$\Delta_{\infty}$ is the gap in the thermodynamic limit. Second, in a finite
size system a spin-flip producing unpaired fermions leads to the appearance of
solitons with non-zero momenta, which provides an extra (non-exponential)
contribution $\delta$. For moderate but still large values of
$N_a\Delta_{\infty} /t$, these corrections significantly increase and may
become comparable with the $1/N_a$ conformal correction. Moreover, in the case
of weak interactions where $\Delta_{\infty}\ll t$, the exponential correction
exceeds higher order power law corrections in a wide range of parameters,
namely for $N_a\lesssim (8t/\Delta_{\infty})\ln(4t/|U|)$, and so does $\delta$
even in a wider range of $N_a$. For sufficiently small number of particles,
which can be of the order of thousands in the weakly interacting regime, the
gap is fully dominated by finite size effects.

particles and radiation are produced during early inflation. The emitted
radiation thermalizes the universe to a very high temperature $ \sim
10^{18}{\rm GeV}$. The exit of the universe from inflationary phase is followed
by deceleration due to radiation-dominance heralding the standard cosmology
with background radiation having the initial temperature $ \sim 10^{18}{\rm
GeV}$. It is found that dark matter is induced by curvature and baryonic matter
is produced during inflation. Radiation-dominated phase is followed by
deceleration due to matter-dominance. The curvature-induced phantom dark energy
dominates at the red-shift $ z = 0.303 $ causing the late acceleration. It is
found that the universe will collapse in future. Further, it is investigated
that back-reaction of quantum particles produced near the collapse time can
avoid cosmic collapse and the universe will escape to revival of the state of

have on the power spectrum (PS) of 21-cm fluctuations by varying both the
average X-ray MFP and the fractional contribution of X-rays to reionization. In
general, prior to the epoch when the intergalactic medium is dominated by
ionized regions (H {\sevensize II} regions), X-ray-induced ionization enhances
fluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the X-ray MFP, provided that X-ray
heating does not strongly supress galaxy formation. Conversely, at later times
when \H2 regions dominate, small-scale fluctuations in the 21-cm signal are
suppressed by X-ray ionization. Our modelling also shows that the modification
of the 21-cm signal due to the presence of X-rays is sensitive to the relative
scales of the X-ray MFP, and the characteristic size of \H2 regions. We
therefore find that X-rays imprint an epoch and scale-dependent signature on
the 21-cm PS, whose prominence depends on fractional X-ray contribution. The
degree of X-ray heating of the IGM also determines the extent to which these
features can be discerned. We show that the MWA will have sufficient
sensitivity to detect this modification of the PS, so long as the X-ray photon
MFP falls within the range of scales over which the array is most sensitive
($\sim0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$). In cases in which this MFP takes a much smaller value,
an array with larger collecting area would be required.

resolution revealed a rotating structure at the position of a candidate massive
protostar, with a well-sampled position-velocity diagram suggesting Keplerian
rotation. Observations presented here using the European VLBI Network (EVN)
have provided the first high angular resolution maps of the masers, providing a
test for the disc hypothesis and the Gaussian centroiding technique. The EVN
maps have confirmed the shape of the disc and its rotation curve. Weaker maser
emission seen previously with MERLIN between the two main spectral peaks is
seen in the EVN total power spectrum, but is absent in the cross-power
spectrum. This suggests that the spatially extended emission is resolved out by
the EVN. The rotating disc is coincident with a Class I massive (proto)star and
at the implied centre of an outflow traced by two bow shocks. We discuss the
impact of this result on the massive stellar accretion disc hypothesis and on
the validity of the centroiding technique to determine the structures of
unresolved masers using compact radio interferometric arrays.

dispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well
as multi-patches environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive
ratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases'
persistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it
implies that for a wide range of parameters that infection rate will tend
maximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit
models that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence
of trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection
period and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear
relationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher
mobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i.e.,
the phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and
the spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it
will saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for multi-patches case, we find
that the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected
fraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.

assumptions of the code are described in detail. Described tests show, that our
models are numerically robust and reproduce basic observational constraints.
  We discuss the effects of different treatment of some quantities in other
pulsation hydrocodes. Our most important finding concerns the treatment of the
turbulent source function in convectively stable regions. In our code we allow
for negative values of source function in convectively stable zones, which
reflects negative buoyancy. However, some authors restrict the source term to
non-negative values. We show that this assumption leads to very high turbulent
energies in convectively stable regions. The effect looks like overshooting,
but it is not, because turbulence is generated by pulsations. Also, turbulent
elements do not carry kinetic nor thermal energy, into convectively stable
layers. The range of this artificial overshooting (as we shall call it) is as
large as 6 local pressure scale heights, leading to unphysical internal damping
through the eddy-viscous forces, in deep, convectively stable parts of the
star.

of magnetic field between the factorizing field (h_f) and the critical one
(h_c). The model presents a spin-flop phase for 0<h<h_f with an energy scale
which is defined by the long range antiferromagnetic order while it undergoes
an entanglement phase transition at h=h_f. The entanglement estimators clearly
show that the entanglement is lost exactly at h=h_f which justifies different
quantum correlations on both sides of the factorizing field. As a consequence
of zero entanglement (at h=h_f) the ground state is known exactly as a product
of single particle states which is the starting point for initiating a spin
wave theory. The linear spin wave theory is implemented to obtain the specific
heat and thermal entanglement of the model in the interested region. A double
peak structure is found in the specific heat around h=h_f which manifests the
existence of two energy scales in the system as a result of two competing
orders before the critical point. These results are confirmed by the low

the influence of the competition between several activity-dependent synaptic
processes, such as short-term synaptic facilitation and depression, on the
maximum memory storage capacity in a neural network. In contrast with the case
of synaptic depression, which drastically reduces the capacity of the network
to store and retrieve ""static"" activity patterns, synaptic facilitation
enhances the storage capacity in different contexts. In particular, we found
optimal values of the relevant synaptic parameters (such as the
neurotransmitter release probability or the characteristic facilitation time
constant) for which the storage capacity can be maximal and similar to the one
obtained with static synapses, that is, without activity-dependent processes.
We conclude that depressing synapses with a certain level of facilitation allow
to recover the good retrieval properties of networks with static synapses while
maintaining the nonlinear characteristics of dynamic synapses, convenient for
information processing and coding.

of the mexican hat form, and a DBI action for the kinetic terms. We show that
it is a continuous deformation of the Abelian-Higgs model, with a single
deformation parameter depending on a dimensionless combination of the scalar
coupling constant, the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field at
infinity, and the brane tension. By means of numerical calculations, we
investigate the profiles of the corresponding DBI-cosmic strings and prove that
they have a core which is narrower than that of Abelian-Higgs strings. We also
show that the corresponding action is smaller than in the standard case
suggesting that their formation could be favoured in brane models. Moreover we
show that the DBI-cosmic string solutions are non-pathological everywhere in
parameter space. Finally, in the limit in which the DBI model reduces to the
Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Abelian-Higgs model, we find that DBI
cosmic strings are no longer BPS: rather they have positive binding energy. We
thus argue that, when they meet, two DBI strings will not bind with the
corresponding formation of a junction, and hence that a network of DBI strings

Clouds, connects M20 to the W28 supernova remnant. These filaments pre-exist
the formation of the Trifid and were originally self-gravitating. The fragments
produced are very massive (100 Msun or more) and are the progenitors of the
cometary globules observed at the border of the HII region. We could identify
33 cores, 16 of which are currently forming stars. They are usually
gravitationally unbound and have low masses of a few Msun. The densest starless
cores (several 10^5 cm-3) may be the site for the next generation of stars. The
physical gas and dust properties of the cometary globules have been studied in
detail and have been found very similar. They all are forming stars. Several
intermediate-mass protostars have been detected in the cometary globules and in
the deeply embedded cores. Evidence of clustering has been found in the shocked
massive cores TC3-TC4-TC5. M20 is a good example of massive-star forming region
in a turbulent, filamentary molecular cloud. Photoionization appears to play a
minor role in the formation of the cores. The observed fragmentation is well
explained by MHD-driven instabilities and is usually not related to M20. We
propose that the nearby supernova remnant W28 could have triggered the
formation of protostellar clusters in nearby dense cores of the Trifid.

be explained assuming a short burst of star formation in these galaxies when

molecular globule, Globule 2, in the Coalsack Nebula revealed that it contains
a strong central ring of dust column density. This ring represents a region of
high density and pressure that is likely a transient and possibly turbulent
structure. Dynamical models suggest that the ring has formed as a result of a
sudden increase in external pressure which is driving a compression wave into
the Globule. Here we combine the extinction measurements with a detailed study
of the C18O (1-0) molecular line profiles toward Globule 2 in order to
investigate the overall kinematics and, in doing so, test this dynamical model.
We find that the ring corresponds to an enhancement in the C18O non-thermal
velocity dispersion and non-thermal pressure. We observe a velocity gradient
across the Globule that appears to trace two distinct systematic subsonic
velocity flows that happen to converge within the ring. We suggest, therefore,
that the ring has formed as two subsonic flows of turbulent gas merge within
the Globule. The fact that the outer layers of the Globule appear stable
against collapse yet there is no centrally condensed core, suggests that the
Globule may be evolving from the outside in and has yet to stabilize,
confirming its youth.
