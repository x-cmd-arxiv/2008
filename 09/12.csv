Stokes V spectra of the system were obtained with the ESPaDOnS instrument

detailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strong
chemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in the

to be a very young Bp star. In this context, line profile variations of the
primary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.

Method or the restoration of broken symmetries within the nuclear Energy
Density Functional (EDF) framework are becoming a standard tool in nuclear
structure physics. These calculations rely on the extension of a
single-reference energy functional, of the Gogny or the Skyrme types, to
non-diagonal energy kernels. There is no rigorous constructive framework for
this extension so far. The commonly accepted way proceeds by formal analogy
with the expressions obtained when applying the generalized Wick theorem to the
non-diagonal matrix element of a Hamilton operator between two product states.
It is pointed out that this procedure is ill-defined when extended to EDF
calculations as the generalized Wick theorem is taken outside of its range of
applicability. In particular, such a procedure is responsible for the
appearance of spurious divergences and steps in multi-reference EDF energies,
as was recently observed in calculations restoring particle number or angular
momentum. In the present work, we give a formal analysis of the origin of this
problem for calculations with and without pairing, i.e. constructing the
density matrices from either Slater determinants or quasi-particle vacua. We
propose a correction to energy kernels that removes the divergences and steps,
and which is applicable to calculations based on any symmetry restoration or
generator coordinate. The method is formally illustrated for particle number
restoration and is specified to configuration mixing calculations based on
Slater determinants.

massive galaxies is suppressed in dense environments, in agreement with
previous studies. Yet, nearly 40% of the star-forming galaxies have red optical
colors at intermediate and high densities. These red systems are not
starbursting; they have star formation rates per unit stellar mass similar to
or lower than blue star-forming galaxies. More than half of the red
star-forming galaxies have low IR-to-UV luminosity ratios, relatively high
Sersic indices and they are equally abundant at all densities. They might be
gradually quenching their star-formation, possibly but not necessarily under
the influence of gas-removing environmental processes. The other >40% of the
red star-forming galaxies have high IR-to-UV luminosity ratios, indicative of
high dust obscuration. They have relatively high specific star formation rates
and are more abundant at intermediate densities. Our results indicate that
while there is an overall suppression in the star-forming galaxy fraction with
density, the small amount of star formation surviving the cluster environment
is to a large extent obscured, suggesting that environmental interactions
trigger a phase of obscured star formation, before complete quenching.

encoded in the definition of the basic energy density functional itself whereas
the second one relates to the canonical procedure followed to extend the use of

of spuriosity relates to the long-known self-interaction problem and to the
newly discussed self-pairing interaction process which might appear when
describing paired systems with energy functional methods using auxiliary

remove completely the anomalies encountered in particle-number restored

numbers that are to be fulfilled by the particle-number-restored formalism. The
correction is found to be on the order of several hundreds of keVs up to about
1 MeV in realistic calculations, which is small compared to the total binding

particle-number restoration and is on the same energy scale as the excitations

enough relative to the ISM, the interaction between the wind and ISM generates
the structure known as the astropause (a stellar analog of the heliopause),
which is a cometary stellar wind cavity bounded by the contact discontinuity
surface between the wind and ISM. Far-infrared observations of Mira spatially
resolve the structure of its astropause for the first time, distinguishing the
contact surface between Mira's wind and the ISM and the termination shock due
to Mira's wind colliding with the ISM. The physical size of the astropause and
the estimated speed of the termination shock suggest the age of the astropause

construct an extended Palatini action, where we do not assume any a priori
relationship between the connection, the covariant metric tensor, and the
contravariant metric tensor. Instead we treat these three quantities as
independent dynamical variables. We show that this action reproduces the
standard Einstein field equations depending on a single metric tensor. We
further show that in this formulation the cosmological constant has an
additional theoretical significance. Normally the cosmological constant is
added to the Einstein field equations for the purpose of having general
relativity be consistent with cosmological observations. In the formulation
presented here, the nonvanishing cosmological constant also ensures the

entanglement is discussed and exemplified for the Kempe invariant I_5 of pure
three-qubit states. It is found to being an independent invariant only in
presence of both W-type entanglement and threetangle. In this case, constant
I_5 admits for a wide range of both threetangle and concurrences. Furthermore,
the present analysis indicates that an SL^3 orbit of states with equal tangles
but continuously varying I_5 must exist. This means that I_5 provides no
information on the entanglement in the system in addition to that contained in
the tangles (concurrences and threetangle) themselves. Together with the
numerical evidence that I_5 is an entanglement monotone this implies that SU(2)
invariance or the monotone property are too weak requirements for the
characterization and quantification of entanglement for systems of three
qubits, and that SL(2,C) invariance is required. This conclusion can be
extended to general multipartite systems (including higher local dimension)
because the entanglement classes of three-qubit systems appear as subclasses.

large-N limit of the O(N+1) extension of the chiral theory. Explicit
resummation allows us to reveal novel phenomena -- the form of the leading
chiral correction to pion PDFs and GPDs depends on the small-x asymptotic of
the pion PDFs. In particular, if the pion PDF in the chiral limit has the
Regge-like small x behaviour q(x)~1/x^\omega, the leading large impact
parameter ($b_\perp\to\infty$) asymptotics of the quark distribution in the
transverse plane has the form ($m_\pi=0$) $q(x,b_\perp)\sim 1/x^\omega\
\ln^{\omega}(b_\perp^2)/b_\perp^{2{(1+\omega)}}$. This result is model
independent and it is controlled completely by the all order resummed ChPT
developed in this paper. This asymptotic interweaves with small-$x$ behaviour
of usual PDFs, hence it depends on the scale, at which the corresponding PDF is
defined. This is a new and interesting result in which the chiral expansion

expanded ballistically from 1995-1999 but in 2000 began to deform and
decelerate along its forward edge. It reached an extent of 6"" from the binary

as 20"" south of the binary. The bubble emission nebulosity has a low excitation
overall, as traced by the [S II]/H-alpha line ratio, requiring a nearly
comoving surrounding medium that has been accelerated by previous ejections or
stellar winds.
  Within the broad bubbles there are compact emission knots whose alignments
and proper motions indicate that collimated jets are ejected from each binary
component. The jet from the southern component, XZ Tau A, is aligned with the
outflow axis of the bubbles and has tangential knot velocities of 70-200 km/s.
Knots in the northern flow are seen to slow and brighten as they approach the
forward edge of the outermost bubble. The knots in the jet from the other star,
XZ Tau B, have lower velocities of ~100 km/s.

comoving number density of radio AGN with luminosities less than 10^{25} W

main conclusion is that the fraction of radio-loud AGN increases towards higher
redshift in all massive galaxies, but the evolution is particularly strong for
the lower mass galaxies in our sample. These trends may be understood if there
are two classes of radio galaxies (likely associated with the ""radio"" and
""quasar mode"" dichotomy) that have different fuelling/triggering mechanisms and

the point where the strand becomes self-interacting. A central question is how
it is possible that so many initial configurations proceed to fold to a unique
final configuration. We put energy and dynamical considerations temporarily
aside and focus upon the geometry alone. We parameterize the structure of an
idealized protein using the concept of a ribbon from differential geometry. The
deformation of the ribbon is described by introducing a generic twisting
Ansatz. The folding process in this picture entails a change in shape guided by
the local amino acid geometry. The theory is reparamaterization invariant from
the start, so the final shape is independent of folding time. We develop
differential equations for the changing shape. For some parameter ranges, a
sine-Gordon torsion soliton is found. This purely geometric waveform has
properties similar to dynamical solitons. Namely: A threshold distortion of the
molecule is required to initiate the soliton, after which, small additional
distortions do not change the waveform. In this analysis, the soliton twists
the molecule until bonds form. The analysis reveals a quantitative relationship
between the geometry of the amino acids and the folded form.

with the Saha thermodynamic equilibrium, which provides experimental
verification of the two-component analysis and density scaling. During exciton
formation, in turn, the pair kinetics is quantitatively described by a Saha
equilibrium that follows the carrier cooling dynamics. The terahertz-derived
kinetics is, moreover, consistent with time-resolved luminescence measured for
comparison. Our study establishes a basis for tracking pair densities via

kinematics of candidate HVSs (position and velocity vectors), where more
outgoing stars than ingoing stars (i.e. positive Galactocentric velocities vs.
negative ones) are observed. We show that such kinematic asymmetry, which is
likely due to the finite lifetime of the stars and Galactic potential

clusters to probe the dynamics and mass profile of the group's center, out to
60 kpc (~10 R_eff) -- the most extended data set to date around an early-type
galaxy. This sample consists of 172 GC velocities, most of them newly obtained
using Keck/DEIMOS, with a few additional objects identified as DGTOs or as
IGCs. We find weak rotation in the GC system's outer parts, with the metal-poor
and metal-rich GCs misaligned. The RMS velocity profile declines rapidly to a
radius of ~20 kpc, and then becomes flat or rising to ~60 kpc. There is
evidence that the GC orbits have a tangential bias that is strongest for the
metal-poor GCs -- possibly contradicting theoretical expectations. We construct
cosmologically-motivated galaxy+dark halo dynamical models and infer a mass
within 60 kpc of ~3x10^12 M_Sun, extrapolating to a virial mass of ~6x10^13
M_Sun for a typical LCDM halo -- in agreement with results from group galaxy
kinematics. We present an independent Chandra-based analysis, whose relatively
high mass at ~20 kpc disagrees strongly with the GC-based result unless the GCs
are assumed to have a peculiar orbit distribution, and we discuss some general
comparisons between X-ray and optical results. The group's B-band mass-to-light
ratio of ~800 is extreme even for a rich galaxy cluster, much less a poor group
-- placing it among the most dark matter dominated systems in the universe, and
also suggesting a massive reservoir of baryons lurking in an unseen phase, in
addition to the nonbaryonic dark matter. We compare the kinematical and mass
properties of the NGC 1407 group to other nearby groups and clusters, and

explain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves,

flux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. Our simulations also provide
reasonable matches to the Spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16,

fraction of the absorber can describe the spectral variations seen in Mrk 273,
although a reduction in the intrinsic AGN luminosity cannot be formally ruled
out. The {\it Suzaku} spectra of Mrk 273 are well fit by a ~94% covering
fraction model with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The
absorption-corrected log[$L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ / $L_{\rm IR}$] ratio is consistent
with those found in PG Quasars. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum of PKS 1345+12 and Arp
220 seem unchanged from previous observations and their hard X-ray emission is
not convincingly detected by the HXD/PIN. The large column density derived from
CO observations and the large equivalent width of an ionized Fe line in Arp 220
can be reconciled by an ionized reflection model. F08572+3915 is undetected in
both the XIS and HXD/PIN, but the analysis of unpublished {\em Chandra} data
provides a new measurement at low energies.

spectral properties of nine moderate-luminosity (L_x ~ 10^43 erg s^-1) type 2
Seyferts detected in the Cl1604 complex. We find that the AGN are predominantly
hosted by luminous spheroids and/or bulge dominated galaxies which have colors
that place them in the valley between the blue cloud and red sequence in
color-magnitude space, consistent with predictions that AGN hosts should
constitute a transition population. Half of the hosts have bluer overall colors
as a result of blue resolved cores in otherwise red spheroids and a majority
show signs of recent or pending interactions. We also find a substantial number
exhibit strong Balmer absorption features indicative of post-starburst
galaxies, despite the fact that we detect narrow [OII] emission lines in all of
the host spectra. If the [OII] lines are due in part to AGN emission, as we
suspect, then this result implies that a significant fraction of these galaxies
(44%) have experienced an enhanced level of star formation within the last ~1
Gyr which was rapidly suppressed. Overall we find that the properties of the
nine host galaxies are generally consistent with a scenario in which recent
interactions have triggered both increased levels of nuclear activity and an
enhancement of centrally concentrated star formation, followed by a rapid
truncation of the latter, possibly as a result of feedback from the AGN itself.

clusters, Cl 0023+0423 at z = 0.84 and RX J1821.6+6827 at z = 0.82. The
optically-selected Cl 0023+0423 is a four-way group-group merger with
constituent groups having velocity dispersions between 206-479 km/s. The galaxy
population is dominated by blue, star-forming galaxies, with a substantial
contribution from recent starbursts. In contrast, the X-ray-selected RX
J1821.6+6827 is a largely-isolated, massive cluster with a measured velocity
dispersion of 926 +/- 77 km/s. The cluster exhibits a well defined red sequence

communication complexity is the logarithm of the approximation rank of the
communication matrix--the minimum rank of a matrix which is entrywise close to
the communication matrix. This technique has two main drawbacks: it is
difficult to compute, and it is not known to lower bound quantum communication
complexity with entanglement.
  Linial and Shraibman recently introduced a norm, called gamma_2^{alpha}, to
quantum communication complexity, showing that it can be used to lower bound
communication with entanglement. Here the parameter alpha is a measure of
approximation which is related to the allowable error probability of the
protocol. This bound can be written as a semidefinite program and gives bounds
at least as large as many techniques in the literature, although it is smaller
than the corresponding alpha-approximation rank, rk_alpha. We show that in fact
log gamma_2^{alpha}(A)$ and log rk_{alpha}(A)$ agree up to small factors. As
corollaries we obtain a constant factor polynomial time approximation algorithm
to the logarithm of approximate rank, and that the logarithm of approximation
rank is a lower bound for quantum communication complexity with entanglement.

an AGN contribution. High accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts was
accomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with high
significance detections, 2) a new set of SED templates including 18 hybrids
covering the far-UV to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by the
combination of AGN and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epoch
observations that have been used to correct for variability (most important for
type 1 AGN). The reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated using
the sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. We
achieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ for
i$_{AB}^*<$22.5 ($\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ for
i$_{AB}^*<$24.5). The high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (where
the SED is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 AGN and QSOs out to

photometric redshift estimates for X-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%

the radiation pressure that is exerted by this scattered Lya radiation on the
outflowing material. We show that for reasonable physical parameters, Lya
radiation pressure alone can accelerate supershells to velocities in the range
v_sh=200-400 km/s. These supershells possibly escape from the gravitational
potential well of their host galaxies and contribute to the enrichment of the
intergalactic medium. We compute the physical properties of expanding
supershells that are likely to be present in a sample of known high-redshift
(z=2.7-5.0) galaxies, under the assumption that they are driven predominantly
by Lya radiation pressure. We predict ranges of radii r_sh=0.1-10 kpc, ages
t_sh=1-100 Myr, and energies E_sh=1e53-1e55 ergs, which are in reasonable
agreement with the properties of local galactic supershells. Furthermore, we
find that the radius, r_sh, of a Lya-driven supershell of constant mass depends
uniquely on the intrinsic Lya luminosity of the galaxy, L_alpha, the HI column
density of the supershell, N_HI, and the shell speed, v_sh, through the scaling
relation r_sh ~ L_alpha/(N_HI v_sh^2). We derive mass outflow rates in

provide a window to the underlying Yukawa structure of the scalar sector.
Color-octet scalars naturally appear in grand unified theories based on the
SU(5) gauge symmetry. In the context of adjoint SU(5) these fields are expected
to be light to satisfy constraints coming from unification and proton decay,
and may have TeV-scale masses. One combination of their couplings is defined by
the relation between the down-quark and charged-lepton Yukawa couplings.
Observation of these states at the LHC gives an upper bound on the proton
lifetime if they truly arise from this grand unified theory. We demonstrate
that TeV-mass scalars can be observed over background at the LHC using boosted
top quark final states, and study how well the scalar Yukawa parameters can be
measured.

$\Omega_k$ in the range of $1 \le \Omega_k \le 1.3$. We argue that this

also show the evidence that the frequency separation between the twin kHz QPOs
decreases with the flux by $2\sim~3$ Hz on the BLN time scales, which is
consistent with the trend on the longer time scale that the Z source traces the

frequencies are bimodally distributed. The dynamics of this system has been the
subject of long-standing interest. In 1984 Kuramoto proposed several
conjectures about its behavior; ten years later, Crawford obtained the first
analytical results by means of a local center manifold calculation.
Nevertheless, many questions have remained open, especially about the
possibility of global bifurcations. Here we derive the system's complete
stability diagram for the special case where the bimodal distribution consists
of two equally weighted Lorentzians. Using an ansatz recently discovered by Ott
and Antonsen, we show that in this case the infinite-dimensional problem
reduces exactly to a flow in four dimensions. Depending on the parameters and
initial conditions, the long-term dynamics evolves to one of three states:
incoherence, where all the oscillators are desynchronized; partial synchrony,
where a macroscopic group of phase-locked oscillators coexists with a sea of
desynchronized ones; and a standing wave state, where two counter-rotating
groups of phase-locked oscillators emerge. Analytical results are presented for
the bifurcation boundaries between these states. Similar results are also
obtained for the case in which the bimodal distribution is given by the sum of
two Gaussians.

and optical emission from GRB 080319B, which (i) strongly suggest that they
occurred within the same astrophysical source region and (ii) indicate that
their respective radiation mechanisms were most likely dynamically coupled. Our
preliminary results, based upon a new cross-correlation function (CCF)
methodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as
follows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon
counts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic
gamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset
between prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by
TORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively
partitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, prompt
optical emission is nested within intervals of (a) trivial intrinsic gamma-ray
spectral lag (~T+12+-2 and ~T+50+/-2 sec) with (b) discontinuities in the hard
to soft evolution of the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV
Swift-BAT data (~T+8+/-2 and ~T+48+/-1 sec), both of which coincide with the
rise (~T+10+/-1 sec) and decline (~T+50+/-1 sec) of prompt optical emission.
This potential discovery, robust across heuristic permutations of BAT energy
channels and varying temporal bin resolution, provides the first observational
evidence for an implicit connection between spectral lag and the dynamics of
shocks in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology.

detected in the HeII4686/Hbeta and [OIII]5007/Hbeta line ratio maps, aligns
with the direction of the jet inferred from the bow-shock nebula. The cone has
an opening angle ~45 deg and radial extent ~3.8 pc. Since the HeII emission
cannot be explained by the companion O star, the gas in the ionization cone
must be exposed to the `naked' accretion disk, thereby allowing us to place
constraints on the unobservable ionizing spectrum. The energetics of the
ionization cone give unambiguous evidence for an ""ultraviolet - soft X-ray""
(XUV) excess in LMC X-1. Any attempt to match the hard X-ray spectrum (>1keV)
with a conventional model of the accretion disk fails to account for this XUV

obscuration by a dusty torus, or (2) a jet-blown hole in a surrounding envelope

so-called cognitive radio (CR) link under opportunistic spectrum sharing with
an existing primary radio (PR) link. It is assumed that the CR transmitter is
equipped with multi-antennas, whereby transmit precoding and power control can
be jointly deployed to balance between avoiding interference at the PR
terminals and optimizing performance of the CR link. This operation is named as
cognitive beamforming (CB). Unlike prior study on CB that assumes perfect
knowledge of the channels over which the CR transmitter interferes with the PR
terminals, this paper proposes a practical CB scheme utilizing a new idea of
effective interference channel (EIC), which can be efficiently estimated at the
CR transmitter from its observed PR signals. Somehow surprisingly, this paper
shows that the learning-based CB scheme with the EIC improves the CR channel
capacity against the conventional scheme even with the exact CR-to-PR channel
knowledge, when the PR link is equipped with multi-antennas but only
communicates over a subspace of the total available spatial dimensions.
Moreover, this paper presents algorithms for the CR to estimate the EIC over a
finite learning time. Due to channel estimation errors, the proposed CB scheme
causes leakage interference at the PR terminals, which leads to an interesting
learning-throughput tradeoff phenomenon for the CR, pertinent to its time
allocation between channel learning and data transmission. This paper derives
the optimal channel learning time to maximize the effective throughput of the
CR link, subject to the CR transmit power constraint and the interference power
constraints for the PR terminals.

on the small-scale (distance to and morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy)

environments. The impacts of interaction on galaxy properties are detected at
least out to the neighbor separation corresponding to the virial radius of
galaxies, which is typically between 200 and 400 h^{-1}kpc for the galaxies in
our sample. To detect these long-range interaction effects it is crucial to
divide galaxy interactions into four cases dividing the morphology of target
and neighbor galaxies into early and late types. We show that there are two
characteristic neighbor-separation scales where the galaxy interactions cause
abrupt changes in the properties of galaxies. The first scale is the virial
radius of the nearest neighbor galaxy r_{vir,nei}. Many physical parameters
start to deviate from those of extremely isolated galaxies at the projected
neighbor separation r_p of about r_{vir,nei}. The second scale is at r_p
\approx 0.05 r_{vir,nei} = 10--20 h^{-1} kpc, and is the scale at which the
galaxies in pairs start to merge. We find that late-type neighbors enhance the
star formation activity of galaxies while early-type neighbors reduce it, and
that these effects occur within r_{vir,nei}. The hot halo gas and cold disk gas
must be participating in the interactions at separations less than the virial
radius of the galaxy plus dark halo system. Our results also show that the role
of the large-scale density in determining galaxy properties is minimal once
luminosity and morphology are fixed. We propose that the weak residual
dependence of galaxy properties on the large-scale density is due to the
dependence of the halo gas property on the large-scale density.

recently discovered close to the Guitar Nebula, the bow-shock nebula associated
with B2224+65, which is the fastest pulsar known. The nature of this X-ray
feature is unknown, and even its association with pulsar B2224+65 is unclear.
Aims: We attempt to develop a self-consistent scenario to explain the complex
phenomenology of this object. Methods: We assume that the highest energy
electrons accelerated at the termination shock escape from the bow shock and
diffuse into the ambient medium, where they emit synchrotron X-rays. The linear
geometry should reflect the plane-parallel geometry of its ambient field.
Results: We estimate the Lorentz factor of the X-ray emitting electrons and the
strength of the magnetic field. The former (~10^8) is close to its maximum
possible value, while the latter, at ~45 uG, is higher than typical
interstellar values and must have been amplified in some way. The magnetic
field must also be turbulent to some degree to trap the electrons sufficiently
for synchrotron X-ray emission to occur effectively. We propose a
self-consistent scenario in which, by some streaming instability, the electrons
themselves generate a turbulent field in which they then diffuse. Some
numerical coincidences are explained, and tests are proposed to verify our
scenario. Conclusions: Electron leaking may be common in the majority of pulsar
bow-shock nebulae, even though the X-ray nebulosity in general is too diffuse
to be detectable.

analytic diffeomorphisms which unfold a parabolic fixed point of codimension 1.
  In [MRR] (and also [R]), it was shown that the Ecalle-Voronin modulus can be
unfolded to give a complete modulus for such germs. The modulus is defined on a
ramified sector in the canonical perturbation parameter $\eps$. As in the case
of the Ecalle-Voronin modulus, the modulus is defined up to a linear scaling
depending only on $\eps$.
  Here, we characterize the moduli space for such unfoldings by finding the
compatibility conditions on the modulus which are necessary and sufficient for
realization as the modulus of an unfolding.
  The compatibility condition is obtained by considering the region of
sectorial overlap in $\eps$-space. This lies in the Glutsyuk sector where the
two fixed points are hyperbolic and connected by the orbits of the
diffeomorphism. In this region we have two representatives of the modulus which
describe the same dynamics. We identify the necessary compatibility condition
between these two representatives by comparing them both with their common
Glutsyuk modulus.
  The compatibility condition implies the existence of a linear scaling for
which the modulus is 1/2-summable in $\eps$, whose direction of non-summability
coincides with the direction of real multipliers at the fixed points.
Conversely, we show that the compatibility condition (which implies the
summability property) is sufficient to realize the modulus as coming from an
analytic unfolding, thus giving a complete description of the space of moduli.

R=12-15km for the mass range M=1.4-1.8Msun, favoring a stiff equation-of-state
and excluding mass-radius relations based on exotic matter. Combined with an
estimate of the stellar radius R>12.5km from the work of Oezel and

collected by different instruments from 2005 until the end of 2007 on both

the entire period of the observational campaign; it was also observed with
pointed observations by XMM and Swift/XRT in 2005 and 2006 and exhibited flux
variations not linked with the change of any particular spectral features. IGR
J17091-3624 was initially in quiescence (after a period of activity between
2003 April and 2004 April) and it was then detected again in outburst in the
XRT field of view during a Swift observation of IGR J17098--3628 on 2007 July
9. The observations during quiescence provide an upper limit to the 0.2-10 keV
luminosity, while the observations in outburst cover the transition from the
hard to the soft state. Moreover, we obtain a refined X-ray position for IGR
J17091-3624 from the Swift/XRT observations during the outburst in 2007. The
new position is inconsistent with the previously proposed radio counterpart. We
identify in VLA archive data a compact radio source consistent with the new
X-ray position and propose it as the radio counterpart of the X-ray transient.

pressure (up to 2.5 GPa) and magnetic field (up to 9T). Both samples show a
monotonic decrease in the resistivity with an increase in pressure,
corresponding to a change of -35% at 2.5 GPa. No pressure induced
metal-to-insulator transition was observed in the temperature-dependent

field reveals that the effect of pressure cannot be simply rescaled to that of
a specific field, as has been reported for the corresponding bulk material. We
propose an interpretation of the data based on phase separation, where two
different insulating phases coexist: the charge ordered phase, which is
sensitive to both magnetic field and pressure, and a second insulating phase
that can be tuned by magnetic field. Such a result demonstrates that phase
separation can be manipulated in thin films by independent application of
magnetic field and/or external pressure.

The previously reported sinusoidal variability, with a period of 2-hrs, is
recovered here. However, the Sloan-g' and Sloan-i' lightcurves are
anti-correlated, a fact which is incompatible with the currently proposed
starspot explanation for the optical variability. The anti-correlated nature
and relative amplitudes of the optical lightcurves are consistent with the
effects of persistent dust clouds rotating on the surface of the star. In the
absence of other plausible explanations for the optical variability of TVLM
513, it seems likely that dust cloud coverage combined with the rapid rotation
of TVLM 513 is responsible for the optical variability in this object. However,
crude modelling of a photosphere with partial dust cloud coverage shows that
the anti-correlation can only be reproduced using cooler models than the
literature temperature of TVLM 513. We suggest this discrepancy can be removed
if more dust is present within the photosphere of TVLM 513 than theoretical
model atmospheres predict, though a definitive statement on this matter will
require the development of self-consistent models of partially dusty
atmospheres.

velocities of B-type stars are expected to be higher in low metallicity

observed with the VLT-FLAMES 523 B and Be stars, which form, at the moment, the
largest observed sample of these kind of objects in the MCs. We first
determined the stellar fundamental parameters and we found that B and Be stars
rotate faster in the MCs than in the MW. We also determined the first
distribution of the average ZAMS rotational velocities versus the mass of Be
stars. These results indicate that the appearance of Be stars is mass-,
metallicity-, stellar evolution-, and star-formation regions-dependant.
Moreover, the recent models of Long Gamma Ray Bursts progenitors foresee
possible LGRBs progenitors at the SMC's metallicity. We confront these models
with the observed (ZAMS rotational velocities, masses) distributions of the
fastest rotators (Be and Oe stars) in our sample. Furthermore, we compare the

of states as regular languages. Computing such a regular representation of,
say, the set of reachable states of a system requires acceleration techniques
that can finitely compute the effect of an unbounded number of transitions.
Among the acceleration techniques that have been proposed, one finds both
specific and generic techniques. Specific techniques exploit the particular
type of system being analyzed, e.g. a system manipulating queues or integers,
whereas generic techniques only assume that the transition relation is
represented by a finite-state transducer, which has to be iterated. In this
paper, we investigate the possibility of using generic techniques in cases
where only specific techniques have been exploited so far. Finding that
existing generic techniques are often not applicable in cases easily handled by
specific techniques, we have developed a new approach to iterating transducers.
This new approach builds on earlier work, but exploits a number of new

by means of numerical simulations. These models are versions of the ordinary
diffusive single-creation, pair-creation and triplet-creation contact processes
in which the particle number is conserved. The transition between the frozen
and active states was determined by studying the system in the subcritical
regime and the nature of the transition, whether continuous or first order, was
determined by looking at the fractal dimension of the critical cluster. For the
single-creation model the transition remains continuous for any diffusion rate.
For pair- and triplet-creation models, however, the transition becomes first
order for high enough diffusion rate. Our results indicate that in the limit of
infinite diffusion rate the jump in density equals 2/3 for the pair-creation
model and 5/6 for the triplet-creation model.

campaign to search for rapid and correlated flux density variability and
signatures of an inverse-Compton (IC) catastrophe during the states of extreme
apparent brightness temperatures. The observing campaign involved simultaneous
monitoring at radio to IR/optical wavelengths centered around a 500-ks INTEGRAL
pointing (November 10-17, 2003). We present the combined analysis and results
of the cm- to sub-mm observations including a detailed study of the inter- to
intra-day variability and spectral characteristics of 0716+714. We further
constrain the variability brightness temperatures (T_B) and Doppler factors
(delta) comparing the radio-bands with the hard X-ray emission (3-200 keV).
0716+714 was in an exceptionally high state (outburst) and different (slower)
phase of short-term variability. The flux density variability in the cm- to
mm-bands is dominated by a correlated, ~4 day time scale amplitude increase of
up to ~35% systematically more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths. This
contradicts expectations from standard interstellar scintillation (ISS) and
suggests a source-intrinsic origin of the variability. The derived lower limits
to T_B exceed the 10^12 K IC-limit by up to 3-4 orders of magnitude. Assuming
relativistic boosting, we obtain robust and self-consistent lower limits of
delta >= 5-33, in good agreement with delta_VLBI obtained from VLBI studies and
the IC-Doppler factors delta_IC > 14-16 obtained from the INTEGRAL data. Since
a strong contribution from ISS can be excluded and a simultaneous IC
catastrophe was not observed, we conclude that relativistic Doppler boosting
naturally explains the apparent violation of the theoretical limits within
standard synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) jet models of AGN.

Davidovic","Tunable Spin Filtering through an Aluminum Nanoparticle","12 pages 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spin-polarized current through an Al nanoparticle in tunnel contact with two
ferromagnets is measured as a function of the direction of the applied magnetic
field. The nanoparticle filters the spin of injected electrons along a
direction specified by the magnetic field. The characteristic field scale for
the filtering corresponds to a lower limit of $8ns$ for the spin-dephasing
time. Spin polarized current versus applied voltage increases stepwise,
confirming that the spin relaxation time is long only in the ground state and
the low-lying excited states of the nanoparticle.

together with the Cartan homomorphism among the two, and we extend the
Chern-Weil homomorphism to the twisted equivariant cohomology. We clarify that
in order to have a cohomology theory, the coefficients of the twisted
equivariant cohomology must be taken in the completed polynomial algebra over
the dual Lie algebra of $G$. We recall the relation between the equivariant
cohomology of exact Courant algebroids and the twisted equivariant cohomology,
and we show how to endow with a generalized complex structure the finite
dimensional approximations of the Borel construction $M\times_G EG_k$, whenever
the generalized complex manifold $M$ possesses a Hamiltonian $G$ action.
