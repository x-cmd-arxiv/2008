natural way provided that the heavy neutrino singlets are quasi-Dirac
particles. In such case, their contribution to light neutrino masses has the
suppression of a small lepton number violating parameter, so that light
neutrino masses can arise naturally even if the seesaw scale is low and the
heavy neutrino mixing is large. We implement the same mechanism with fermionic
triplets in type III seesaw, deriving the interactions of the new quasi-Dirac
neutrinos and heavy charged leptons with the SM fermions. We then study the
observability of heavy Dirac neutrino singlets (seesaw I) and triplets (seesaw
III) at LHC. Contrarily to common wisdom, we find that heavy Dirac neutrino
singlets with a mass around 100 GeV are observable at the 5 sigma level with a
luminosity of 13 fb^-1. Indeed, in the final state with three charged leptons
l+- l+- l-+, not previously considered, Dirac neutrino signals can be
relatively large and backgrounds are small. In the triplet case, heavy
neutrinos can be discovered with a luminosity of 1.5 fb^-1 for a mass of 300
GeV in the same channel.

3-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theory with product gauge group U(N)^{2n}.
The latter describes M2-branes probing an orbifold where a torus emerges in a
scaling limit. It is expected that the SL(2, Z) duality of the 4-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory will be shown in M-theory point of view since it is trivially
realized as modular transformations of the torus. Indeed, starting from one
single Chern-Simons-matter theory, we find infinitely many equivalent
4-dimensional theories differing up to T-transformation of the SL(2, Z)
redefinition of the gauge coupling tau=theta/2pi + 4pi i/g^2 and a parity
transformation in 4 dimensions. Although S-transformation can not be shown in
our work, it is important that a part of the SL(2, Z) transformation is
realized via the M2-brane action. Thus we think our work can be a step toward a
proof of Montonen-Olive duality via M2-branes.

decoupling at 10^13 s with a turbulent morphology determined by the plasma
turbulence and the Nomura scale 10^20 m, which is determined by gravity, the
fossilized density and rate-of-strain of the 10^12 s time of first structure
and the large photon viscosity of the plasma. After decoupling, the gas
proto-galaxies fragment into 10^36 kg proto-globular-star-cluster PGC clumps of
earth-mass 10^25 kg hot gas clouds that eventually freeze to form
primordial-fog-particle PFP dark matter planets. The rotation of galaxies
reflects density gradients of big bang turbulent mixing and the sonic expansion

spherical harmonic components of CMB temperature anomalies, the Milky Way and

proto-galaxies stick together by frictional processes of the frozen gas
planets, just as PGCs have been meta-stable for the 13.7 Gyr age of the

$\{1,2,...,n\}$ in a random graph order on $\mathbb{Z}$. We refine this result
by providing an expression for the average number of posts in a random graph
order on $\{1,2,...,n\}$, thereby quantifying the edge effects associated with
the elements $\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{1,2,...,n\}$. Specifically, we prove that
the expected number of posts in a random graph order of size $n$ is
asymptotically linear in $n$ with a positive $y$-intercept. The error
associated with this approximation decreases monotonically and rapidly in $n$,
permitting accurate computation of the expected number of posts for any $n$ and
$p$. We also prove, as a lemma, a bound on the difference between the Euler
function and its partial products that may be of interest in its own right.

considerably enhance, in some cases, the gamma-ray flux at the high energies

harder annihilation spectra than traditionally considered. While the detection
of the spectral features introduced by internal bremsstrahlung would constitute
a smoking gun signature for dark matter annihilation, we find that for most

detect unless one adopts rather (though by no means overly) optimistic
astrophysical assumptions about the distribution of dark matter in the dwarfs.

1902 acoustic theory, neglecting nonlinear instabilities controlled by
viscosity, turbulence and diffusion. Because the Jeans scale L_J for the hot
primordial plasma is always slightly larger than the scale of causal connection
ct, where c is the speed of light and t is the time after the big bang, it has
been assumed that no plasma structures could form without guidance from a cold
(so L_J CDM is small) collisionless cold-dark-matter CDM fluid to give
condensations that gravitationally collect the plasma. Galaxies by this CDM
model form by gradual hierarchical-clustering of CDM halos to galaxy mass over
billions of years. No observations exist of CDM halos. Gravitational
instability is non-linear and absolute, controlled by viscous and turbulent
forces or by diffusivity at Schwarz length scales smaller than ct. Because the
universe during the plasma epoch is rapidly expanding, the first structures
formed were at density minima by fragmentation when the viscous-gravitional
scale L_SV first matched ct at 30,000 years to produce protosupercluster voids
and protosuperclusters. Weak turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries
guide the morphology of smaller fragments down to protogalaxy size just before
transition to gas at 300,000 years. The size of the protogalaxies reflect the
plasma Kolmogorov scale with a linear and spiral morphology predicted by the
Nomura direct numerical simulations and confirmed by deep field space telescope
observations. On transition to gas the kinematic viscosity decreases by ten
trillion so the protogalaxies fragment as Jeans scale clouds, each with a
trillion earth-mass planets, as predicted by Gibson 1996 and observed by Schild

higher gas density there is not canceled by the UV radiation from the QSOs. We

No such differences are found for early-type galaxies. We have also constructed
surface brightness and colour profiles for the central and satellite galaxies

observed differences between satellite and central galaxies can be explained by
a simple fading model, in which the star formation in the disk decreases over
timescales of 2-3 Gyr after a galaxy becomes a satellite. Processes that induce
strong morphological changes (e.g. harassment) and processes that strip the
galaxy of its entire ISM need not to be invoked in order to explain the
environmental dependencies we find.

based on a substructure of a ring of localized bubbles which initially contain
3-4 partons of almost entirely gluons. A Glasma Flux Tube Model (GFTM) which
formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane of two colliding sheets
of Color Glass Condensate (CGC) which pass through one another had been
developed. These sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color
electric and magnetic fields. A blast wave gives the tubes near the surface
transverse flow in the same way it gave flow to the bubbles in the PBM. In this
paper we connect the equivalent characteristics of the PBM to the GFTM and show
that the intermediate transverse momentum charged-two-particle angular
correlations of the most central and highest energy RHIC Au + Au collisions are
explained. When one considers a 3-4 GeV/c transverse momentum tagged charged
trigger particle in combination with other intermediate transverse momentum
charged particles, the ridge correlation is generated and explained. The
longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields of GFTM have a non-zero
topological charge density $F \widetilde $F. These fields cause a local strong
CP violation which effects charged particle production coming from quarks and
anti-quarks created in the tube or bubble. We developed four-charged-particle
correlations which show this CP effect and accumulate from bubble to bubble
independent of whether particles are pushed or pulled and rotated in a right or
left handed direction, We demonstrate strong evidence for the predicted color
electric field using previously published experimental data. We developed 4
particle correlations for obtaining evidence for the predicted color magnetic
field.

detect in the system, and despite the rapid rotation of the components, we are
able to determine the absolute masses and radii to better than 1.3% and 2%,
respectively. We obtain M(A) = 1.032 +/- 0.013 M(Sun) and R(B) = 1.262 +/-
0.023 R(Sun) for the hotter, larger, and more massive primary (star A), and
M(B) = 0.968 +/- 0.012 M(Sun) and R(B) = 1.173 +/- 0.023 R(Sun) for the

150 K. The intrinsic variability with a period about 1% shorter than the
orbital period is interpreted as being due to modulation by spots on one or
both components. This implies that the spotted star(s) must be rotating faster
than the synchronous rate, which disagrees with predictions from current tidal
evolution models according to which both stars should be synchronized. We also
find that the radius of the secondary is larger than expected from stellar
evolution calculations by about 10%, a discrepancy also seen in other (mostly
lower-mass and active) eclipsing binaries. We estimate the age of the system to
be approximately 9 Gyr. Both components are near the end of their main-sequence

identified in the SDSS, after all observational biases have been taken into
account; (b) about 88% of the dominant central objects in fossil groups are
elliptical galaxies that have a median R-band absolute magnitude of $\sim
-23.5-5 log h$, which is typical of the observed fossil groups known in the
literature; (c)first-ranked galaxies of systems with $ {\cal M} >$ 5 x 10$^{13}
h^{-1} {\cal M}_\odot$, regardless of whether they are either fossil or
non-fossil, are mainly formed by gas-poor mergers; (d) although fossil groups,
in general, assembled most of their virial masses at higher redshifts in
comparison with non-fossil groups, first-ranked galaxies in fossil groups
merged later, i.e. at lower redshifts, compared with their non-fossil-group

embedding approximation. That is, the electronic wavefunction is calculated in
the presence of the mean field of the environment. In this paper a direct
quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) analog of such a mean-field
theory is formulated based on variational and perturbative frameworks. In the
variational framework, an appropriate QM/MM free energy functional is defined
and is minimized in terms of the trial wavefunction that best approximates the
true QM wavefunction in a statistically averaged sense. Analytical free energy
gradient is obtained, which takes the form of the gradient of effective QM
energy calculated in the averaged MM potential. In the perturbative framework,
the above variational procedure is shown to be equivalent with the first-order
expansion of the QM energy (in the exact free energy expression) about the
self-consistent reference field. This helps understand the relation between the
variational procedure and the exact QM/MM free energy as well as existing QM/MM
theories. Based on this, several ways are discussed for evaluating
non-mean-field effects (i.e., statistical fluctuations of the QM wavefunction)
that are neglected in the mean-field calculation. As an illustration, the
method is applied to an SN2 Menshutkin reaction in water, NH3 + CH3CL ->
NH3CH3^{+} + CL^{-}, for which free energy profiles are obtained at the HF,
MP2, B3LYP, and BH&HLYP levels by integrating the free energy gradient.
Non-mean-field effects are evaluated to be < 0.5 kcal/mol using a Gaussian
fluctuation model for the environment, which suggests that those effects are
rather small for the present reaction in water.

and understood using a toy model which is simple enough to allow for analytical
estimates of the eigenfrequencies. The essential ingredients of this model, in
the unperturbed regime, are a stationary shock and a subsonic region of
deceleration. For the sake of analytical simplicity, the 2D unperturbed flow is
parallel and the deceleration is produced adiabatically by an external
potential. The instability mechanism is determined unambiguously as the
consequence of a cycle between advected and acoustic perturbations. The purely
acoustic cycle, considered alone, is proven to be stable in this flow. Its
contribution to the instability can be either constructive or destructive. A
frequency cut-off is associated to the advection time through the region of
deceleration. This cut-off frequency explains why the instability favours
eigenmodes with a low frequency and a large horizontal wavelength. The relation
between the instability occurring in this highly simplified toy model and the
properties of SASI observed in the numerical simulations of stellar
core-collapse is discussed. This simple set up is proposed as a benchmark test
to evaluate the accuracy, in the linear regime, of numerical simulations
involving this instability. We illustrate such benchmark simulations in a

numerical convergence with respect to the computation mesh size is studied with
1D simulations. We demonstrate that the numerical accuracy of the quantities

argue that this property is likely to be true for most current numerical
schemes dealing with SASI in the core-collapse problem, and could be solved by
the use of advanced techniques for the numerical treatment of the shock. We
propose a strategy to choose the mesh size for an accurate treatment of the

silicate mantle. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in
combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of
convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. Here we show
that (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics
over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and
melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3)
stagnant lid planets live fast (they have higher rates of melting than their
plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution) but die young
(melting shuts down after a few Gyr); (4) plate tectonics may not operate on
high mass planets because of the production of buoyant crust which is difficult
to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient
volcanic degassing - volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts,
which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on
young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and
the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to
reach the surface. If volcanism is detected in the Tau Ceti system, and tidal
forcing can be shown to be weak, this would be evidence for plate tectonics.

  Bombay",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of nodes that come together to
dynamically create a network, with no fixed infrastructure or centralized
administration. An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes,
bandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of
wireless networks (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such
as voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS)
guarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming
increasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task
because of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information.
Hence, it is important to have a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing
capability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows.
  In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing
protocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector
(SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance
Vector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a
cross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a
node is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of
SQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no
additional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV
possesses a make-before-break re-routing capability that enables near-zero
packet drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation,
making it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks.

energy-momentum of the gravity field is reviewed. As it was noted 90 years ago
by Hilbert (1917), Einstein (1918), Schrodinger (1918) and Bauer (1918) within
Geometrical Gravity approach (General Relativity) there is no tensor
characteristics of the energy-momentum for the gravity field. Landau & Lifshitz
(1971) called this quantity pseudo-tensor of energy-momentum and noted that
Einstein's equations does not express the energy conservation for matter plus
gravity field. This has crucial consequences for gravity physics and cosmology,
such as negative energy density for static gravity field and violation of
energy conservation in expanding space. However there is alternative Field
Gravity approach for description of gravitation as a symmetric tensor field in
Minkowski space, which is similar to description of all other physical
interactions and based on well-defined positive, localizable energy-momentum of
the gravity field. This relativistic quantum Field Gravity approach was
partially developed by Firz & Pauli (1939), Birkhoff (1944), Thirring (1961),
Kalman (1961), Feynman (1963) and others. Here it is shown that existence of
well-defined positive energy-momentum of the gravity field leads to radical
changes in gravity physics and cosmology, including such new possibilities as
two-component nature of gravity - attraction (spin 2) and repulsion (spin 0),
absence of black holes and singularities, scalar gravitational radiation caused
by spherically symmetric gravitational collapse.

proposed by Bonazzola, Gourgoulhon, Grandcl\'ement, and Novak is one of these

conformal flatness condition (CFC) which, in the last ten years, has been used
in many astrophysical applications. The elliptic part of the FCF basically
shares the same differential operators as the elliptic equations in CFC scheme.
We present here a reformulation of the elliptic sector of CFC that has the

soft gamma-ray burst (GRB 060602B). The burst position was under observation
using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) at the time the burst

it is widely known that in general eigenstates of the interaction are not

E 78, 061117 (2008)","10.1103/PhysRevE.78.061117",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well established that the phase transition between survival and
extinction in spreading models with short-range interactions is generically
associated with the directed percolation (DP) universality class. In many
realistic spreading processes, however, interactions are long ranged and well
described by L\'{e}vy-flights, i.e., by a probability distribution that decays
in $d$ dimensions with distance $r$ as $r^{-d-\sigma}$. We employ the powerful
methods of renormalized field theory to study DP with such long range,
L\'{e}vy-flight spreading in some depth. Our results unambiguously corroborate
earlier findings that there are four renormalization group fixed points
corresponding to, respectively, short-range Gaussian, L\'{e}vy Gaussian,
short-range DP and L\'{e}vy DP, and that there are four lines in the $(\sigma,
d)$ plane which separate the stability regions of these fixed points. When the
stability line between short-range DP and L\'{e}vy DP is crossed, all critical
exponents change continuously. We calculate the exponents describing L\'{e}vy
DP to second order in $\epsilon$-expansion, and we compare our analytical
results to the results of existing numerical simulations. Furthermore, we
calculate the leading logarithmic corrections for several dynamical
observables.

sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the Nevanlinna-Pick
interpolation problem on the unit disk with the additional restriction that the
interpolant should have the value of its derivative at the origin equal to
zero. This concrete mild generalization of the classical problem is
prototypical of a number of other generalized Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation
problems which have appeared in the literature (for example, on a
finitely-connected planar domain or on the polydisk). We extend the results of
Davidson-Paulsen-Raghupathi-Singh to the setting where the interpolant is
allowed to be matrix-valued and elaborate further on the analogy with the
theory of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation on a finitely-connected planar domain.

possible to study the motions of liquids in nanolayers and to generalize the

dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical renormalization group and a bare

has more dispersion in the perpendicular direction than in the two-dimensional
planes; (ii) the DMFT approach can produce upper and lower Hubbard bands that
resemble those in the experiment, but the upper bands will overlap in energy
with other higher energy bands; (iii) the effect of the finite width of the
probe pulse is minimal on the shape of the photoemission spectra; and (iv) the
quasiequilibrium approximation does not fully describe the behavior in this
system.
