time division duplexing channels is proposed. The setup assumes a packet
erasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information
simultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before
stopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of
freedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. We
provide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of
coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before
stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet
erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver
requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time
to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. We show that
its performance is very close to that of a full duplex system, while
transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in
performance, especially if latency is high. Also, we study the throughput
performance of our scheme and compare it to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and
Selective Repeat ARQ schemes. Numerical results, obtained for different
latencies, show that our scheme has similar performance to the Selective Repeat
in most cases and considerable performance gain when latency and packet error
probability is high.

a classical integrable system with an integrable quantum spin system, whose
parameters obey classical equations of motion. We show that the fundamental
R-matrix of the model (which satisfies a difference property Yang-Baxter
equation) naturally splits into a product of a singular ""classical"" part and a
finite dimensional quantum part. The classical part of the $R$-matrix itself
satisfies the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and therefore can be factored out
producing, however, a certain ""twist"" of the quantum part. We show that the
resulting equation exactly coincides with the star-triangle relation of the
N-state chiral Potts model. The associated spin model on the whole lattice is,
in fact, more general than the chiral Potts and reduces to the latter only for
the simplest (constant) classical background. In a general case the model is
inhomogeneous: its Boltzmann weights are determined by non-trivial background
solutions of the equations of motion of the classical discrete sine-Gordon
model.

sequences for control-affine optimal control problems by so-called degree of
singularity. It is shown that, in the particular case of singular
linear-quadratic problems, this degree is tightly related to the ""order of

exception is a test due to Green for ""triangle freeness"": a function
$f:\cube^{n}\to\cube$ satisfies this property if $f(x),f(y),f(x+y)$ do not all
equal 1, for any pair $x,y\in\cube^{n}$.
  Here we extend this test to a more systematic study of testing for
linear-invariant non-linear properties. We consider properties that are
described by a single forbidden pattern (and its linear transformations), i.e.,
a property is given by $k$ points $v_{1},...,v_{k}\in\cube^{k}$ and
$f:\cube^{n}\to\cube$ satisfies the property that if for all linear maps
$L:\cube^{k}\to\cube^{n}$ it is the case that $f(L(v_{1})),...,f(L(v_{k}))$ do

matroid specified by $v_{1},...,v_{k}$ is a graphic matroid. This extends
Green's result to an infinite class of new properties.

between the notion of ""1-complexity linear systems"" of Green and Tao, and

seven of the spectra show PAH emission, but no silicate emission at 10 microns.
The central wavelengths of the 6.2, 7.7--8.2, and 11.3 micron emission features
decrease with stellar temperature, indicating that the PAHs are less
photo-processed in cooler radiation fields. The apparent low level of photo
processing in HAeBe stars, relative to other PAH emission sources, implies that
the PAHs are newly exposed to the UV-optical radiation fields from their host
stars. HAeBe stars show a variety of PAH emission intensities and ionization
fractions, but a narrow range of PAH spectral classifications based on
positions of major PAH feature centers. This may indicate that, regardless of
their locations relative to the stars, the PAH molecules are altered by the
same physical processes in the proto-planetary disks of intermediate-mass
stars. Analysis of the mid-IR spectral energy distributions indicates that our
sample likely includes both radially flared and more flattened/settled disk
systems, but we do not see the expected correlation of overall PAH emission
with disk geometry. We suggest that the strength of PAH emission from HAeBe
stars may depend not only on the degree of radial flaring, but also on the
abundance of PAHs in illuminated regions of the disks and possibly on the
vertical structure of the inner disk as well.

that are important for understanding the physics involved in formation of their
pulse profiles. I then discuss main effects responsible for shaping these
profiles. Some analytical results that help to understand the results of
simulations are presented. Constraints on the pulsar geometry and the neutron
star equation of state obtained from the analysis of the pulse profiles are
discussed.

"0809.2517","Juan Cuadra","Juan Cuadra and Bojana Femic","A sequence to compute the Brauer group of certain quasi-triangular Hopf
  algebras",,,,,"math.QA math.CT math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A deeper understanding of recent computations of the Brauer group of Hopf
algebras is attained by explaining why a direct product decomposition for this
group holds and describing the non-interpreted factor occurring in it. For a
Hopf algebra $B$ in a braided monoidal category $\C$, and under certain
assumptions on the braiding (fulfilled if $\C$ is symmetric), we construct a
sequence for the Brauer group $\BM(\C;B)$ of $B$-module algebras, generalizing
Beattie's one. It allows one to prove that $\BM(\C;B) \cong \Br(\C) \times
\Gal(\C;B),$ where $\Br(\C)$ is the Brauer group of $\C$ and $\Gal(\C;B)$ the
group of $B$-Galois objects. We also show that $\BM(\C;B)$ contains a subgroup
isomorphic to $\Br(\C) \times \Hc(\C;B,I),$ where $\Hc(\C;B,I)$ is the second
Sweedler cohomology group of $B$ with values in the unit object $I$ of $\C$.
These results are applied to the Brauer group of a quasi-triangular Hopf
algebra that is a Radford biproduct $B \times H$, where $H$ is a usual Hopf
algebra over a field $K$, the Hopf subalgebra generated by the quasi-triangular
structure $\R$ is contained in $H$ and $B$ is a Hopf algebra in the category
${}_H\M$ of left $H$-modules. The Hopf algebras whose Brauer group was recently
computed fit this framework. We finally show that $\BM(K,H,\R) \times
\Hc({}_H\M;B,K)$ is a subgroup of the Brauer group $\BM(K,B \times H,\R),$
confirming the suspicion that a certain cohomology group of $B \times H$
(second lazy cohomology group was conjectured) embeds into $\BM(K,B \times
H,\R).$ New examples of Brauer groups of quasi-triangular Hopf algebras are
computed using this sequence.

the velocity dynamics of shallow water waves. This equation exhibits
spontaneous emergence of singular solutions (peakons) from smooth initial
conditions. The CH equation has been recently extended to a two-component
integrable system (CH2), which includes both velocity and density variables in
the dynamics. Although possessing peakon solutions in the velocity, the CH2
equation does not admit singular solutions in the density profile. We modify
the CH2 system to allow dependence on average density as well as pointwise
density. The modified CH2 system (MCH2) does admit peakon solutions in velocity
and average density. We analytically identify the steepening mechanism that
allows the singular solutions to emerge from smooth spatially-confined initial
data. Numerical results for MCH2 are given and compared with the pure CH2 case.
These numerics show that the modification in MCH2 to introduce average density
has little short-time effect on the emergent dynamical properties. However, an
analytical and numerical study of pairwise peakon interactions for MCH2 shows a
new asymptotic feature. Namely, besides the expected soliton scattering
behavior seen in overtaking and head-on peakon collisions, MCH2 also allows the
phase shift of the peakon collision to diverge in certain parameter regimes.
