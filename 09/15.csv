smooth radial density profile. This transition is gradual and at ~75 Myr the
distribution is statistically indistinguishable from the background SMC
distribution. This time-scale corresponds to approximately the dynamical
crossing time of stars in the SMC. The spatial positions of the star clusters
in the SMC show a similar evolution of spatial distribution with age. Our
analysis suggests that stars form with a high degree of (fractal)
sub-structure, probably imprinted by the turbulent nature of the gas from which
they form, which is erased by random motions in the galactic potential on a

the understanding of the QCD phase transition in the high-density nuclear

being a ``phase diagram'' of rapidly rotating compact star configurations in
the plane of spin frequency and mass, determined with state-of-the-art hybrid
equations of state, allowing for a transition to color superconducting quark
matter. The second is the study of spin-up and accretion evolution in this
phase diagram. We show that the quark matter phase transition leads to a
characteristic line in the Omega-M plane, the phase border between neutron
stars and hybrid stars with a quark matter core. Along this line a change in
the pulsar's moment of inertia entails a waiting point phenomenon in the
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) evolution: most of these objects
should therefore be found along the phase border in the Omega-M plane, which
may be viewed as the AMXP analog of the main sequence in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for normal stars. In order to prove the existence
of a high-density phase transition in the cores of compact stars we need
population statistics for AMXP's with sufficiently accurate determination of
their masses and spin frequencies.

bridge this gap for a natural and important special case, planar graph

planar graph canonization is in logspace. This improves the previously known
upper bound of AC1 [MillerReif'91].
  Our algorithm first constructs the biconnected component tree of a connected

component tree. The next step is to logspace reduce the biconnected planar
graph isomorphism and canonization problems to those for 3-connected planar

is achieved by using the above decomposition, and by making significant

further new ideas, including a non-trivial case analysis and a group theoretic

double its mass every few ten million years. This requires that the seed
accrete at approximately the Eddington-limited rate. In the specific case of
radiatively efficient quasiradial accretion in a metal-poor protogalactic
medium, for which the Bondi accretion rate is often prescribed in cosmological
simulations of massive black hole formation, we examine the effects of the
radiation emitted near the black hole's event horizon on the structure of the
surrounding gas flow. We find that the radiation pressure from photoionization
significantly reduces the steady-state accretion rate and renders the
quasiradial accretion flow unsteady and inefficient. The time-averaged
accretion rates are a small fraction of the Eddington-limited accretion rate
for Thomson scattering. The pressure of Ly-alpha photons trapped near the HII
region surrounding the black hole may further attenuate the inflow. These
results suggest that an alternative to quasiradial, radiatively efficient
Bondi-like accretion should be sought to explain the rapid growth of
quasar-progenitor seed black holes.

(BME) up to second order for our studies of the velocity structure in
self-gravitating stellar disks. A key assumption of our BME approach is the
zero-heat flux approximation, i.e. the neglection of third order velocity
terms. We tested this assumption by performing test particle simulations for
stars in a disk galaxy subject to a rotating spiral perturbation. As a result
we corroborated qualitatively the complex velocity structure found in the BME
approach. It turned out that an equilibrium configuration in velocity space is
only slowly established on a typical timescale of 5 Gyrs or more. Since many
dynamical processes in galaxies (like the growth of spirals or bars)act on
shorter timescales, pure equilibrium models might not be fully appropriate for
a detailed comparison with observations like the local Galactic velocity
distribution. Third order velocity moments were typically small and
uncorrelated over almost all of the disk with the exception of the 4:1
resonance region (UHR). Near the UHR (normalized) fourth and fifth order
velocity moments are still of the same order as the second and third order
terms. Thus, at the UHR higher order terms are not negligible.

3C 31 at six frequencies in the range 1365 to 8440MHz to explore the spatial
scale and origin of the rotation measure (RM) fluctuations on the line of sight
to the radio source. We analyse the distribution of the degree of polarization
to show that the large depolarization asymmetry between the North and South
sides of the source seen in earlier work largely disappears as the resolution
is increased. We show that the depolarization seen at low resolution results
primarily from unresolved gradients in a Faraday screen in front of the
synchrotron-emitting plasma. We establish that the residual degree of
polarization in the short-wavelength limit should follow a Burn law and we fit
such a law to our data to estimate the residual depolarization at high
resolution. We show that the observed RM variations over selected areas of 3C
31 are consistent with a power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in front of 3C
31 whose power-law slope changes significantly on the scales sampled by our
data. The power spectrum can only have the form expected for Kolmogorov
turbulence on scales <5 kpc. On larger scales we find a flatter slope. We also
compare the global variations of RM across 3C 31 with the results of
three-dimensional simulations of the magnetic-field fluctuations in the
surrounding magnetoionic medium. We show that our data are consistent with a
field distribution that favours the plane perpendicular to the jet axis -
probably because the radio source has evacuated a large cavity in the
surrounding medium. We also apply our analysis techniques to the case of Hydra
A, where the shape and the size of the cavities produced by the source in the

cores on the evolution of the mass in star clusters over the age range
1-100Myr, when star clusters undergo their infant weight-loss/mortality phase.
Assuming a constant formation rate of gas-embedded clusters and a weak tidal
field, we show that the ratio between the total mass in stars bound to the
clusters over that age range and the total mass in stars initially formed in
gas-embedded clusters is a strongly increasing function of the averaged local
SFE, with little influence from any assumed core mass-radius relation. Our
results suggest that, for young starbursts with estimated tidal field strength
and known recent star formation history, observed cluster-to-star mass ratios,
once corrected for the undetected clusters, constitute promising probes of the
local SFE, without the need of resorting to gas mass estimates. Similarly, the
mass ratio of stars which remain in bound clusters at the end of the infant
mortality/weight-loss phase depends sensitively on the mean local SFE, although
the impacts of the width of the SFE distribution function and of the core
mass-radius relation require more careful assessment in this case. Following
the recent finding by Bastian (2008) that galaxies form, on the average, 8% of
their stars in bound clusters regardless of their star formation rate, we raise
the hypothesis that star formation in the present-day Universe is characterized
by a near-universal distribution for the local SFE. A related potential
application of our model consists in tracing the evolution of the local SFE
over cosmological lookback times by comparing the age distribution of the total
mass in star clusters to that in field stars. We describe model aspects which
are still to be worked out before achieving this goal.

X-ray emission traces fairly well the galaxy distribution. Two possible optical

field is presented. It is based on a watershed technique and uses a probability
propagation scheme to improve the quality of the segmentation by circumventing
the discreteness of the sampling. It can be applied within spaces of arbitrary
dimensions and geometry. This recursive segmentation of space yields, for a
$d$-dimensional space, a $d-1$ succession of $n$-dimensional subspaces that
fully characterize the topology of the density field. The final 1D manifold of
the hierarchy is the fully connected network of the primary critical lines of
the field : the skeleton. It corresponds to the subset of lines linking maxima
to saddle points, and provides a definition of the filaments that compose the
cosmic web as a precise physical object, which makes it possible to compute any
of its properties such as its length, curvature, connectivity etc... When the
skeleton extraction is applied to initial conditions of cosmological N-body
simulations and their present day non linear counterparts, it is shown that the
time evolution of the cosmic web, as traced by the skeleton, is well accounted
for by the Zel'dovich approximation. Comparing this skeleton to the initial
skeleton undergoing the Zel'dovich mapping shows that two effects are competing
during the formation of the cosmic web: a general dilation of the larger
filaments that is captured by a simple deformation of the skeleton of the
initial conditions on the one hand, and the shrinking, fusion and disappearance
of the more numerous smaller filaments on the other hand. Other applications of

for the simultaneous best fit to the sigma(tot) and rho ratios, the ratios of
the real to imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitudes. The lower
energy data are included in the integral of FESR, the more precisely determined
is the non-leading term such as log s, and then helps to determine the leading
terms like log2 s. We have derived the value of B(pi p) as B(pi p)=0.311 +-

theories defined on stochastic superspace. At the classical level, the
supersymmetry breaking is parameterized in terms of a single (in general
complex) mass parameter, $\xi$, describing the stochasticity of the
Grassmannian superspace coordinates. In the context of the standard model with
stochastic supersymmetry, the structure of the soft breaking terms has various
characteristic features that can be tested in LHC experiments. Namely, at the
classical level, the $B_{\mu}$ parameter, the universal soft trilinear coupling
$A_0$, the universal gaugino mass $m_{1/2}$ and the universal scalar mass $m_0$
are given solely in terms of $\xi$; there are no other arbitrary parameters.
The relations are $B_\mu = \xi^*$, $A_0 = 2\xi^*$, $m_{1/2} = |\xi|/2$ and $m_0
= 0$. At the quantum level, these relations hold at a certain scale $\Lambda$
which is a second free parameter. The soft scalar masses, zero at tree-level,
are induced radiatively through the renormalization group equations at
one-loop. With this pattern of soft breaking terms, large supersymmetric
contributions to FCNC processes are avoided. As a concrete illustration of the
proposed formalism, we consider a minimal model, which is just the constrained
MSSM with the stochastic superspace relations amongst the soft-breaking
parameters imposed at the scale $\Lambda$. We show that this theory is
phenomenologically viable for a certain region in the $(\xi,\Lambda)$ parameter
space. Some sensible extensions of the minimal model are then briefly
discussed.

lattices, namely, the $\cE$-lattices whose real forms are $A_2$, $D_4$, $E_6$

unitary reflection groups, a question that was raised by Brou\'{e}, Malle and
Rouquier. To this end, we describe an algorithm which, given a unitary
reflection group $G$, picks out a set of complex reflections. The algorithm is
based on an analogy with Weyl groups. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algorithm
immediately yields a set of simple roots. Experimentally we observe that if $G$
is primitive and $G$ has a set of roots whose $\ZZ$--span is a discrete subset
of the ambient vector space, then the algorithm selects a minimal generating
set for $G$. The group $G$ has a presentation on these generators such that if
we forget that the generators have finite order then we get a (Coxeter-like)
presentation of the corresponding braid group. For some groups, such as
$G_{33}$ and $G_{34}$, new diagrams are obtained. For $G_{34}$, our new diagram
extends to an ""affine diagram"" with $\ZZ/7\ZZ$ symmetry.

Universe promises to give direct constraints on the epoch of reionization
(EoR). It will, though, be very challenging to extract the cosmological signal
(CS) from foregrounds and noise which are orders of magnitude larger.
Fortunately, the signal has some characteristics which differentiate it from
the foregrounds and noise, and we suggest that using the correct statistics may
tease out signatures of reionization. We generate mock datacubes simulating the
output of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) EoR experiment. These cubes combine
realistic models for Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the noise with
three different simulations of the CS. We fit out the foregrounds, which are
smooth in the frequency direction, to produce residual images in each frequency
band. We denoise these images and study the skewness of the one-point
distribution in the images as a function of frequency. We find that, under
sufficiently optimistic assumptions, we can recover the main features of the
redshift evolution of the skewness in the 21cm signal. We argue that some of
these features - such as a dip at the onset of reionization, followed by a rise
towards its later stages - may be generic, and give us a promising route to a
statistical detection of reionization.

observed synchrotron spectra of the three remnants are used to determine the
average momentum distribution of nonthermal electrons as a function of the
assumed magnetic field strength. Then the inverse Compton emission spectrum in
the Cosmic Microwave Background photon field is calculated and compared with
the existing upper limits for the very high energy gamma-ray flux from these
sources. It is shown that the expected interstellar magnetic fields
substantially overpredict even these gamma-ray upper limits. Only rather
strongly amplified magnetic fields could be compatible with such low gamma-ray
fluxes. However this would require a strong component of accelerated nuclear
particles whose energy density substantially exceeds that of the synchrotron
electrons, compatible with existing theoretical acceleration models for nuclear
particles and electrons. Even though the quantitative arguments are simplistic,
they appear to eliminate simplistic phenomenological claims in favor of a
inverse Compton gamma-ray scenario for these sources.

energy loss rate (Edot) against those with a low Edot. We show that the
differences in the total intensity pulse morphology between the two classes are
in general rather subtle. A much more significant difference is the fractional
polarization which is very high for high Edot pulsars and low for low Edot
pulsars. The Edot at the transition is very similar to the death line predicted
for curvature radiation. This suggests a possible link between high energy and
radio emission in pulsars and could imply that gamma-ray efficiency is
correlated with the degree of linear polarization in the radio band. The degree
of circular polarization is in general higher in the second component of
doubles, which is possibly caused by the effect of co-rotation on the curvature
of the field lines in the inertial observer frame.
  The most direct link between the high energy emission and the radio emission
could be the sub-group of pulsars which we call the energetic wide beam
pulsars. These young pulsars have very wide profiles with steep edges and are
likely to be emitted from a single magnetic pole. The similarities with the
high energy profiles suggest that both types of emission are produced at the
same extended height range in the magnetosphere. Alternatively, the beams of
the energetic wide beam pulsars could be magnified by propagation effects in
the magnetosphere. This would naturally lead to decoupling of the wave modes,
which could explain the high degree of linear polarization. As part of this
study, we have discovered three previous unknown interpulse pulsars (and we
detected one for the first time at 20 cm). We also obtained rotation measures
for 18 pulsars whose values had not previously been measured.

present a way to also estimate the spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon coupling

the local WIMP density (of a factor of ~ 2), at least an upper limit on the SI

strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted

Suzaku is reported. Since Feigelson et al. (1995) and Kaneda et al. (1995)
discovered the cosmic microwave background boosted inverse-Comptonized (IC)
X-rays from the radio lobe, the magnetic field and electron energy density in
the lobes have been estimated under the assumption that a single component of
the relativistic electrons generates both the IC X-rays and the synchrotron
radio emission. However, electrons generating the observed IC X-rays in the 1
-- 10 keV band do not possess sufficient energy to radiate the observed
synchrotron radio emission under the estimated magnetic field of a few micro-G.
On the basis of observations made with Suzaku, we show in the present paper
that a 0.7 -- 20 keV spectrum is well described by a single power-law model
with an energy index of 0.68 and a flux density of 0.12+/-0.01 micro-Jy at 1
keV from the West lobe. The derived multiwavelength spectrum strongly suggests
that a single electron energy distribution over a Lorentz factor gamma = 300 -
90000 is responsible for generating both the X-ray and radio emissions. The
derived physical quantities are not only consistent with those reported for the
West lobe, but are also in very good agreement with those reported for the East
lobe.

  Frolov, 170 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we study higher-dimensional rotating black holes. Such black
holes are widely discussed in string theory and brane-world models at present.
We demonstrate that even the most general known Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime,
describing the general rotating higher-dimensional asymptotically (anti) de
Sitter black hole with NUT parameters, is in many aspects similar to its
four-dimensional counterpart. Namely, we show that it admits a fundamental
hidden symmetry associated with the principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor.
Such a tensor generates towers of hidden and explicit symmetries. The tower of
Killing tensors is responsible for the existence of irreducible, quadratic in
momenta, conserved integrals of geodesic motion. These integrals, together with
the integrals corresponding to the tower of explicit symmetries, make geodesic
equations in the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime completely integrable. We further
demonstrate that in this spacetime the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and
stationary string equations allow complete separation of variables and the
problem of finding parallel-propagated frames reduces to the set of the first
order ordinary differential equations. Moreover, we show that the
Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime is the most general Einstein space which possesses all
these properties. We also explicitly derive the most general (off-shell)
canonical metric admitting the principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor and
demonstrate that such a metric is necessarily of the special algebraic type D
of the higher-dimensional algebraic classification. The results presented in
this thesis describe the new and complete picture of the relationship of hidden
symmetries and rotating black holes in higher dimensions.

order to prevent their rupture. Some of them can be considered as a locally
periodic rough boundary. In order to approximate blood flow in arteries and
vessels of the cardio-vascular system containing stents, we use multi-scale
techniques to construct boundary layers and wall laws. Simplifying the flow we
turn to consider a 2-dimensional Poisson problem that conserves essential
features related to the rough boundary. Then, we investigate convergence of
boundary layer approximations and the corresponding wall laws in the case of
Neumann type boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet parts of the domain.
The difficulty comes from the fact that correctors, for the boundary layers
near the rough surface, may introduce error terms on the other portions of the
boundary. In order to correct these spurious oscillations, we introduce a
vertical boundary layer. Trough a careful study of its behavior, we prove
rigorously decay estimates. We then construct complete boundary layers that
respect the macroscopic boundary conditions. We also derive error estimates in
terms of the roughness size epsilon either for the full boundary layer
approximation and for the corresponding averaged wall law.

investigated experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, the $g$ factor
was measured using time-resolved Faraday rotation due to Larmor precession of
electron spins in the temperature range between 4.5 K and 190 K. The experiment
shows an almost linear increase of the $g$ value with the temperature. This
result is in good agreement with other measurements based on photoluminescence
quantum beats and time-resolved Kerr rotation up to room temperature. The
experimental data are described theoretically taking into account a diminishing
fundamental energy gap in GaAs due to lattice thermal dilatation and
nonparabolicity of the conduction band calculated using a five-level kp model.
At higher temperatures electrons populate higher Landau levels and the average
$g$ factor is obtained from a summation over many levels. A very good
description of the experimental data is obtained indicating that the observed
increase of the spin $g$ factor with the temperature is predominantly due to
band's nonparabolicity.

two dimensions (2D). Using different Monte Carlo simulation methods, we
calculate the free energy barrier for nucleation, the line tension and also
investigate the size and shape of the critical nucleus. The study is carried
out at an intermediate level of supersaturation(away from the spinodal limit).
In 2D, a large cut-off in the truncation of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is
required to obtain converged results, whereas low cut-off (say, $2.5\sigma$ is
generally sufficient in three dimensional studies, where $\sigma$ is the LJ
diameter) leads to a substantial error in the values of line tension,
nucleation barrier and characteristics of the critical cluster. It is found
that in 2D, the classical nucleation theory (CNT) fails to provide a reliable
estimate of the free energy barrier. It underestimates the barrier by as much
as 70% at the saturation-ratio S=1.1 (defined as S=P/PC, where PC is the
coexistence pressure at reduced temperature $T^{\star}= 0.427$). Interestingly,
CNT has been found to overestimate the nucleation free energy barrier in three
dimensional (3D)systems near the triple point. In fact, the agreement with CNT
is worse in 2D than in 3D. Moreover, the existing theoretical estimate of the
line tension overestimates the value significantly.

for the self-energy terms are obtained when including the intermediate quark
and antiquark states with a total momentum up to $j=25/2$. Relativistic
one-meson and color-magnetic one-gluon exchange forces are shown to generate
spin 0, 1, 2, etc. operators, which couple the lower and the upper components
of the two interacting valence quarks and yield reasonable matrix elements for
the lower excitation spectrum of the Nucleon and Delta. The only contribution
to the ground state nucleon and $\Delta$ comes from the spin 1 operators, which
correspond to the exchanged pion or gluon in the l=1 orbit, thus indicating,
that the both pion exchange and color-magnetic gluon exchange forces can
contribute to the spin of baryons. Is is shown also that the contribution of
the color-electric component of the gluon fields to the baryon spectrum is
enormously large (more than 500 MeV with a value $\alpha_s=0.65$) and one needs
to restrict to very small values of the strong coupling constant or to exclude
completely the gluon-loop corrections to the baryon spectrum. With this
restriction, the calculated spectrum reproduces the main properties of the
data, however needs further contribution from the two-pion exchange and

evolution of an M7.6 flare on October 24, 2003. The X-ray observations of the
flare taken from the RHESSI spacecraft reveal two phases of the flare
evolution. The first phase is characterized by the altitude decrease of the
X-ray looptop (LT) source for $\sim$11 minutes. Such a long duration of the
descending LT source motion is reported for the first time. The EUV loops,
located below the X-ray LT source, also undergo contraction with similar speed
($\sim$15 km s$^{-1}$) in this interval. During the second phase the two
distinct hard X-ray footpoints (FP) sources are observed which correlate well
with UV and H$\alpha$ flare ribbons. The X-ray LT source now exhibits upward
motion. The RHESSI spectra during the first phase are soft and indicative of
hot thermal emission from flaring loops with temperatures $T>25$ MK at the
early stage. On the other hand, the spectra at high energies ($\varepsilon
\gtrsim$25 keV) follow hard power laws during the second phase ($\gamma =
2.6-2.8$). We show that the observed motion of the LT and FP sources can be
understood as a consequence of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection at a
separator in the corona. During the first phase of the flare, the reconnection
releases an excess of magnetic energy related to the magnetic tensions
generated before a flare by the shear flows in the photosphere. The relaxation
of the associated magnetic shear in the corona by the reconnection process
explains the descending motion of the LT source. During the second phase, the
ordinary reconnection process dominates describing the energy release in terms
of the standard model of large eruptive flares.

values of Fe/H=-0.77(+/-0.36) dex for the thick disk, and Fe/H=-1.42(+/-0.98)
dex for the stellar halo, respectively. These metallicites are consistent with
the metallicity estimates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. We
do not find a vertical abundance gradient for the thick disk between 1 kpc and
4 kpc. However, stars within 1 kpc of the Galactic plane are saturated in our
dataset, and therefore we cannot rule out the observed vertical metallicity
gradient for the thick disk stars in the SDSS. Moreover, we find a negative
trend in the halo metallicity with increasing distance from the Galactic plane.
This trend could be due to a contribution from an increasing number of very
metal poor stars that belong to the outer halo. However, systematic effects in
photometric metallicities are largest for the most metal poor stars, and
therefore these effects cannot be ruled out.

luminosity functions derived from this morphologically-selected sample, or by
using statistical members or spectroscopic members, all show that the
morphological membership provided here can be trusted. For the first time, the
morphological classification of Coma galaxies reaches magnitudes that are faint
enough to observe the whole magnitude range of the giant types, E, S0, and

sense, improving the statistics of old objects may provide constraints for a
better understanding of the dynamical dissolution of open clusters. Isochrone
fits indicate that FSR 1716 is more probably an old ($\sim7$ Gyr) and absorbed
($\aV=6.3\pm0.2$) open cluster, located $\approx0.6$ kpc inside the Solar
circle in a contaminated central field. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility of a low-mass, loose globular cluster. Czernik 23 is shown to be an
almost absorption-free open cluster, $\sim5$ Gyr old, located about 2.5 kpc
towards the anti-centre. In both cases, Solar and sub-Solar ($[Fe/H]\sim-0.5$)
metallicity isochrones represent equally well the stellar sequences. Both star
clusters have a low mass content ($\la200 \ms$) presently stored in stars.
Their relatively small core and cluster radii are comparable to those of other
open clusters of similar age. These structural parameters are probably
consequence of the several Gyrs of mass loss due to stellar evolution, tidal
interactions with the disk (and bulge in the case of FSR 1716), and possibly
giant molecular clouds. Czernik 23, and especially FSR 1716, are rare examples
of extreme dynamical survivors. The identification of both as such represents
an increase of $\approx10%$ to the known population of open clusters older than

data, are used to estimate the dissipation of swell energy for a number of
storms. Swells can be very persistent with energy e-folding scales exceeding
20,000 km. For increasing swell steepness this scale shrinks systematically,
down to 2800 km for the steepest observed swells, revealing a significant loss
of swell energy. This value corresponds to a normalized energy decay in time
{\ss} = 4.2 x 10-6 s -1 . Many processes may be responsible for this
dissipation. Because no particular trend is found with wind magnitude and
direction, the increase of dissipation rate in dissipation with swell steepness
is interpreted as a laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer, with
a threshold Reynolds number of the order of 100,000. These observations of
swell evolution open the way for more accurate wave forecasting models, and
provides a constraint on swell-induced air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy.

component on the thermal component is treated in the two-fluid approximation,
and we include thermal particle injection and energy transfer due to the
acoustic instability in the precursor. The transient state of our model that
describes the current state of the shock at knot g, occurs during the evolution
from a thermal gas dominated shock to a smooth cosmic-ray dominated shock.
Assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc to Tycho's remnant we obtain values for the
cosmic ray diffusion coefficient, the injection parameter, and the time scale
for the energy transfer of 10^{24} cm^{2} s^{-1}, 4.2x10^{-3}, and 426 y,
respectively. We have also studied the parameter space for fast (300 km s^{-1}
- 3000 km s^{-1}), time-asymptotically steady shocks and have identified a
branch of solutions, for which the temperature in the cosmic ray precursor
typically reaches 2-6x10^{4} K and the bulk acceleration of the flow through
the precursor is less than 10 km s^{-1}. These solutions fall into the low
cosmic ray acceleration efficiency regime and are relatively insensitive to
shock parameters. This low cosmic ray acceleration efficiency branch of

discs of binary post-AGB stars using high-resolution TIMMI2 and SPITZER
infrared spectra. Methods: We perform a full spectral fitting to the infrared
spectra using the most recent opacities of amorphous and crystalline dust
species. This allows for the identification of the carriers of the different
emission bands. Our fits also constrain the physical properties of different
dust species and grain sizes responsible for the observed emission features.
Results: In all stars the dust is oxygen-rich: amorphous and crystalline
silicate dust species prevail and no features of a carbon-rich component can be
found, the exception being EPLyr, where a mixed chemistry of both oxygen- and
carbon-rich species is found. Our full spectral fitting indicates a high degree
of dust grain processing. The mineralogy of our sample stars shows that the
dust is constituted of irregularly shaped and relatively large grains, with
typical grain sizes larger than 2 micron. The spectra of nearly all stars show
a high degree of crystallinity, where magnesium-rich end members of olivine and
pyroxene silicates dominate. Other dust features of e.g. silica or alumina are
not present at detectable levels. Temperature estimates from our fitting
routine show that a significant fraction of grains must be cool, significantly
cooler than the glass temperature. This shows that radial mixing is very
efficient is these discs and/or indicates different thermal conditions at grain
formation. Our results show that strong grain processing is not limited to
young stellar objects and that the physical processes occurring in the discs
are very similar to those in protoplanetary discs.

that this distribution can be analytically derived in the framework of the
hierarchical merging scenario for galaxy formation, assuming that the component
sub-haloes had chemical properties similar to those of the progenitors of
satellite galaxies of the MW. 2) The age-metallicity relationship (AMR) in the
solar neighborhood; I argue for caution in deriving from data with important
uncertainties (such as the age uncertainties in the Geneva-Kopenhaguen survey)
a relationship between average metallicity and age: derived relationships are
shown to be systematically flatter than the true ones and should not be
directly compared to models. 3) The radial mixing of stars in the disk, which
may have important effects on various observables (scatter in AMR, extension of
the tails of the metallicity distribution, flatenning of disk abundance
profiles). Recent SPH + N-body simulations find considerable radial mixing, but
only comparison to observations will ultimately determine the extent of that
mixing.

background-free spectra of strongly bound anions, for which no dissociation
channels are observed. The first gas-phase spectra of acetate and propionate
are presented using SF6 as electron scavenger and a free electron laser as
source of intense and tunable infrared radiation. To validate the method, we
compare infrared spectra obtained through multiple photon electron
detachment/attachment and multiple photon dissociation for the benzoate anion.
In addition, different electron acceptors are used, comparing both associative
and dissociative electron capture. The relative energies of dissociation (by
CO2 loss) and electron detachment are investigated for all three anions by DFT
and CCSD(T) methods. DFT calculations are also employed to predict vibrational
frequencies, which provide a good fit to the infrared spectra observed. The
frequencies of the symmetric and antisymmetric carboxylate stretching modes for
the aliphatic carboxylates are compared to those previously observed in
condensed-phase IR spectra and to those reported for gas-phase benzoate,
showing a strong influence of the solution environment and a slight substituent

interlayer coupling. A relatively weak antiferromagnetic coupling was found in
EuS/SrS and in EuS/PbSe systems but no interlayer coupling was detected in

($E_g\approx 4$ eV), a very weak and short range interlayer coupling is in
agreement with the earlier theoretical predictions that the interlayer coupling
strength in EuS-based magnetic semiconductor superlattices depends strongly on
the energy gap of the nonmagnetic layer and should decrease with an increase of
the energy gap of the spacer material. A weak coupling in EuS/PbSe and no
coupling in EuS/PbTe, where both PbSe and PbTe are narrow-gap semiconductors
($E_g\approx 0.3$ eV), is in disagreement not only with the theoretical
expectations but also in a stark contrast with earlier results for another
narrow-gap spacer system -- EuS/PbS, where pronounced antiferromagnetic
coupling persists even in samples with PbS layer thickness as large as 200 \AA.
A possible influence of the increasing lattice mismatch between EuS and the

radio source is a restarting radio galaxy and, using our Chandra data, we argue
that the currently active lobes are expanding supersonically, driving a shock
with Mach number $2.4^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$ into the inter-stellar medium. This would
be only the third strong shock round a young radio source to be discovered,
after Centaurus A and NGC 3801. However, in contrast to both these systems, the
host galaxy of B2 0838+32A shows no evidence for a recent merger, while the AGN
spectrum shows no evidence for the dusty torus that would imply a large
reservoir of cold gas close to the central black hole. On the contrary, the AGN

radiativelyinefficient accretion flow that could be controlled by AGN heating

that B2 0838+32A is the first source in which we can directly see

derived from the number-of-phases parameter, is not in accordance with the

objects of all kinds. It is based on Kolmogorov complexity and thus
uncomputable, but there are ways to utilize it. First, compression algorithms
can be used to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity if the objects have a
string representation. Second, for names and abstract concepts, page count
statistics from the World Wide Web can be used. These practical realizations of
the normalized information distance can then be applied to machine learning
tasks, expecially clustering, to perform feature-free and parameter-free data
mining. This chapter discusses the theoretical foundations of the normalized
information distance and both practical realizations. It presents numerous
examples of successful real-world applications based on these distance
measures, ranging from bioinformatics to music clustering to machine
translation.

problems: the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFL), as well as
uncapacitated versions of the $k$-median, $k$-center and $k$-means problems.
All these problems admit natural local search heuristics: for example, in the
UFL problem the natural moves are to open a new facility, close an existing
facility, and to swap a closed facility for an open one; in $k$-medians, we are
allowed only swap moves. The local-search algorithm for $k$-median was analyzed
by Arya et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 33(3):544-562, 2004), who used a clever
``coupling'' argument to show that local optima had cost at most constant times
the global optimum. They also used this argument to show that the local search
algorithm for UFL was 3-approximation; their techniques have since been applied
to other facility location problems.
  In this paper, we give a proof of the $k$-median result which avoids this
coupling argument. These arguments can be used in other settings where the Arya
et al. arguments have been used. We also show that for the problem of opening
$k$ facilities $F$ to minimize the objective function $\Phi_p(F) = \big(\sum_{j
\in V} d(j, F)^p\big)^{1/p}$, the natural swap-based local-search algorithm is
a $\Theta(p)$-approximation. This implies constant-factor approximations for
$k$-medians (when $p=1$), and $k$-means (when $p = 2$), and an $O(\log
n)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem (which is essentially $p
= \log n$).

measurements based on VLBA data for a number of radio-bright, core-dominated
AGN obtained simultaneously at 15, 22 and 43 GHz. The degrees of CP $m_c$ for
the VLBI core region at 15 GHz are similar to values reported earlier at this
wavelength, with typical values of a few tenths of a percent.We find that $m_c$
as often rises as falls with increasing frequency between 15 and 22 GHz, while
$m_c$ at 43 GHz is in all cases higher than at 22 and 15 GHz. This behaviour
seems contrary to expectations, since the degree of CP from both synchrotron
radiation and Faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization should {\em
decrease} towards higher frequencies if the source is homogeneous. The increase
in $m_c$ at 43 GHz may be due to the presence of regions of both positive and
negative CP with different frequency dependences on small scales within the
core region; alternatively, it may be associated with the intrinsic
inhomogeneity of a Blandford-K\""onigl-like jet. In several objects, the
detected CO appears to be near, but not coincident with the core, although
further observations are needed to confirm this. We find several cases of
changes in sign with frequency, most often between 22 and 43 GHz. We find
tentative evidence for transverse structure in the CP of 1055+018 and
1334$-$127 that is consistent with their being generated by either the
synchrotron mechanism or Faraday conversion in a helical magnetic field. Our
results confirm the earlier finding that the sign of the CP at a given
observing frequency is generally consistent across epochs separated by several
years or more, suggesting stability of the magnetic field orientation in the
innermost jets.

different contaminant emissions, often at a greater level than the signal
itself, is a common problem in Astrophysics and Cosmology. The signal can be
recovered, for instance, using a simple Wiener filter. However, in certain
cases, additional information may also be available, such as a second
observation which correlates to a certain level with the sought signal. In
order to improve the quality of the reconstruction, it would be useful to
include as well this additional information. Under these circumstances, we have
constructed a linear filter, the linear covariance-based filter, that extracts
the signal from the data but takes also into account the correlation with the
second observation. To illustrate the performance of the method, we present a
simple application to reconstruct the so-called Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect
from simulated observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and of
catalogues of galaxies.
