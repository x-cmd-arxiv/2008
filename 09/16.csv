neutrino masses are generated through the type I see-saw mechanism. We show
that these can be circumvented when the production from the next-to-lightest

conditions on the low energy parameters have to be satisfied in order for
inverse processes involving the lightest right-handed neutrino not to wash-out
the asymmetry. In particular we find m_1 \gtrsim 0.001 eV, where m_1 is the
mass of the lightest left-handed neutrino and that non-vanishing values of the
mixing angle theta_13 are preferred in the case of a normal fully hierarchical

DM particle compatible with the PAMELA excess seems to have quite unexpected

upcoming data from ATIC-4 and GLAST confirm this feature, this would point to a

more metal-rich than previous studies have found; moreover, unlike the previous
work, our larger sample also reveals that stars with the velocity of the
cluster show a relatively large spread in chemical properties (e.g.,
Delta[Fe/H] > 0.2). This is the first time a possible abundance spread has been
observed in an open cluster, though this is one of several possible
explanations for our observations. While there is an apparent trend of
[alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H], the distribution of abundances of these ""RV cluster

different mean chemical characteristics -- namely (<[Fe/H]>,<[Ti/Fe]>) ~
(-0.06, +0.02) and (-0.28, +0.36). Based on position and kinematics Tombaugh 2
is a likely member of the GASS/Monoceros stream, which makes Tombaugh 2 the
second star cluster within the originally proposed GASS/Monoceros family.
However, we explore other possible explanations for the observed spread in
abundances and two possible sub-populations, with the most likely explanation
being that the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28), more centrally-concentrated
population being the true Tombaugh 2 clusters stars and the metal-rich ([Fe/H]
= -0.06) population being an overlapping, and kinematically associated, but

  In this paper these conventional calculations are carefully reviewed, and
their crucial parts reformulated in a Colombeau algebra -- in which the product

  The conclusions are: (1) The Dirac delta-function insuring energy
conservation in first order perturbation theory belongs to a particular subset
of representatives of the Schwartz distribution defined by the Dirac measure.
These particular representatives have a well-defined square, and lead to a
physically meaningful result in agreement with the data. (2) A truly consistent

correlation with covalency and doping. The range of interaction and itinerancy

large anisotropy when the local moment is not too small. This anisotropy is

baryonic and dark matter evolution, that are extensively compared for the first
time. One is a Tree-SPH code, the other one is a grid-based N-body
sticky-particles code. We show that, at low redshift, galaxy interactions and
mergers in general trigger only moderate star formation enhancements. Strong
starbursts where the star formation rate is increased by a factor larger than 5
are rare and found only in about 15% of major galaxy interactions and mergers.
Merger-driven starbursts are also rather short-lived, with a typical duration
of the activity of a few 10^8 yr. These conclusions are found to be robust,
independent from the numerical techniques and star formation models. At higher
redshifts where galaxies contain more gas, gas inflow-induced starbursts are
neither stronger neither longer than their local counterparts. In turn, the
formation of massive gas clumps, results of local Jeans instability that can
occur spontaneously in gas-rich disks or be indirectly favored by galaxy
interactions, could play a more important role in determining the duration and

showing that a spectroscopic survey must be complete to at least M$^*+1$ if one

from RASS. For a smaller subset (twenty-one clusters) we selected temperature
measures from the literature and estimated mass from the M-T$_X$ relation,
finding that they show good agreement with the virial estimate. However, these
two mass estimates tend to disagree with the caustic results. We measured the
presence of substructure in all clusters of the sample and found that clusters
with substructure have virial masses higher than those derived from T$_X$. This
trend is not seen when comparing the caustic and X-ray masses. That happens
because the caustic mass is estimated directly from the mass profile, so it is
less affected by substructure.

consistent with an X-ray spectrum of an AGN with a partial covering absorber

fraction of about 90%. A comparison with the 2002 Chandra data suggests that
WPVS 007 has become brighter by a factor of about 4. The Swift data also
suggest that the absorber which is causing the current low-state may have
started to disappear. This disappearance is indicated by a significant change
in the hardness ratio from a very soft X-ray state during the 2005 October to
2007 January observations to a rather hard X-ray state in the 2007 September

emission lines can be modelled in terms of a Keplerian gas disc with a radial
extent from ~0.5Rsun to ~1.0. The effective temperature of SDSS0845+2257,
Teff=18600+-500K, is comparable to the two other white dwarfs with gaseous
discs, SDSS1043+0855 and SDSS1228+1040, and hence substantially hotter than the
bulk of white dwarfs where dusty debris discs were identified through the
presence of infrared excess flux. This may suggest that the conditions to
produce emission lines from debris discs in the optical wavelength range are
only met for a relatively narrow range in Teff. The observed asymmetry in the
line profiles indicates a substantial eccentricity in the disc. Two spectra
obtained four years apart reveal a significant change in the shapes and
equivalent widths of the line profiles, implying that the circumstellar disc
evolves on relatively short time scales. In contrast to SDSS1043+0855 and
SDSS1228+1040, SDSS0845+2257 has a helium-dominated atmosphere. We detect
photospheric absorption lines of He, Ca, Mg, and Si in the Sloan Digital Sky

abundances for the three metals determined from model atmosphere fits are
Ca/He~1.3x10^-7, Mg/He~6.0x10^-6, and Si/He~8.0x10^-6. From the non-detection
of Halpha we derive H/He<3x10^-5, which implies that the hydrogen-to-metal
abundance ratio of the circumstellar material is >~1000 times lower than in the
Sun. This lends strong support to the hypothesis that the gaseous and dusty
debris discs found around roughly a dozen white dwarfs originate from the

relations they define are rather different from those of the bulk of the

(M_r>-23) objects are rather flattened and extremely dense for their

merger histories with abnormally large amounts of gaseous dissipation. The more
luminous objects (M_r<-23) tend to be round and to lie in or at the centers of

BCGs. Models in which BCGs form from predominantly radial mergers having little
angular momentum predict that they should be prolate. If viewed along the major
axis, such objects would appear to have abnormally large sigma for their sizes,
and to be abnormally round for their luminosities. This is true of the objects

predictor of the core size than is the velocity dispersion. The correlations of
luminosity and velocity dispersion with core size agree with those seen in
previous studies of galaxy cores. Because of high velocity dispersions, our
sample of galaxies can be expected to harbor the most massive black holes, and
thus have large cores with large amounts of mass ejection. The mass-deficits
inferred from core-Sersic fits to the surface-brightness profiles are

generates a large late-time entropy when it decays. Therefore, all known
mechanisms of generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the literature
have to take this fact into account. In this work, we find that it is still
possible to naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe as
well as light left-handed neutrino masses from a period of Affleck-Dine(AD)
leptogenesis shortly after the end of inflation, in classes of realistic string
constructions with a minimal extension of the MSSM below the unification scale
(consisting only of right-handed neutrinos) and satisfying certain microscopic
criteria described in the text. The consequences are as follows. The lightest
left-handed neutrino is required to be virtually massless. The moduli
(gravitino) problem can be naturally solved in this framework both within
gravity and gauge mediation. The observed upper bound on the relic abundance
constrains the moduli-matter and moduli-gravitino couplings since the DM is
produced non-thermally within this framework. Finally, although not a definite
prediction, the framework naturally allows a light right-handed neutrino and
sneutrinos around the electroweak scale which could have important implications
for DM as well as the LHC.

temperature model. The abundance profiles for Fe, Si, S, but also O are
centrally peaked. Combining the Hydra A results with 5 other clusters for which
detailed chemical abundance studies are available, we find a significant
decrease of O with radius, while the increase in the O/Fe ratio with radius is
small within 0.1 r_200. We compare the observed abundance ratios with the
mixing of various supernova type Ia and core-collapse yield models in different
relative amounts. Producing the estimated O, Si and S peaks in Hydra A requires
either an amount of metals ejected by stellar winds 3-8 times higher than
predicted by available models or a remaining peak in the enrichment by
core-collapse supernovae from the protocluster phase. The temperature map shows
cooler gas extending in arm-like structures towards the north and south. These
structures appear to be richer in metals than the ambient medium and spatially
correlated with the large-scale radio lobes. We estimate the mass of cool gas,

it is flared. The average depth in the bar region is 4.0$\pm$1.4 kpc. The halo
of the LMC (using RR Lyrea stars) is found to have larger depth compared to the
disk/bar, which supports the presence of inner halo for the LMC. The large
depth estimated for the LMC bar and the disk suggests that the LMC might have
had minor mergers. In the case of SMC, the bar depth (4.90$\pm$1.23 Kpc) and
the disk depth (4.23$\pm$1.48 Kpc) are found to be within the standard
deviations. We find evidence for increase in depth near the optical center (up
to 9 kpc). On the other hand, the estimated depth for the halo (RR Lyrea stars)

increased depth and enhanced stellar as well as HI density near the optical

on optimizing diversity and coding gains. This geometric approach leads to
remarkable examples, such as perfect space-time block codes, for which the
complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding is considerable. Code diversity
is an alternative and complementary approach where a small number of feedback
bits are used to select from a family of space-time codes. Different codes lead
to different induced channels at the receiver, where Channel State Information
(CSI) is used to instruct the transmitter how to choose the code. This method
of feedback provides gains associated with beamforming while minimizing the
number of feedback bits. It complements the standard approach to code design by
taking advantage of different (possibly equivalent) realizations of a
particular code design. Feedback can be combined with sub-optimal low
complexity decoding of the component codes to match ML decoding performance of
any individual code in the family. It can also be combined with ML decoding of
the component codes to improve performance beyond ML decoding performance of
any individual code. One method of implementing code diversity is the use of
feedback to adapt the phase of a transmitted signal as shown for 4 by 4
Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (QOSTBC) and multi-user detection using
the Alamouti code. Code diversity implemented by selecting from equivalent
variants is used to improve ML decoding performance of the Golden code. This
paper introduces a family of full rate circulant codes which can be linearly
decoded by fourier decomposition of circulant matrices within the code
diversity framework. A 3 by 3 circulant code is shown to outperform the
Alamouti code at the same transmission rate.

electronic transport properties in disordered nanographene ribbons with zigzag

valleys that are well separated in momentum space, related to the two Dirac
points of the graphene spectrum. The partial flat bands due to edge states make
the imbalance between left- and right-going modes in each valley, {\it i.e.}
appearance of a single chiral mode. This feature gives rise to a perfectly
conducting channel in the disordered system, i.e. the average of conductance
$<g>$ converges exponentially to 1 conductance quantum per spin with increasing
system length, provided impurity scattering does not connect the two valleys,
as is the case for long-range impurity potentials. Ribbons with short-range
impurity potentials, however, through inter-valley scattering, display ordinary
localization behavior. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of
disordered zigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and
the orthogonal class for short-range impurities. The electronic states of
graphene nanoribbons with general edge structures are also discussed, and it is
demonstrated that chiral channels due to the edge states are realized even in

compared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$Mpc for star-forming

massive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of the
most massive galaxies at the present day. In addition, the pBzKs exhibit a
sharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreement
with other recent studies. This plateau cannot be explained by the effects of
incompleteness. We conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoing
passive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenario
for galaxy evolution. Assuming a purely passive evolution for the pBzKs from
their median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggests
that only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pBzK as a main

almost regarded as finite. Since the security is well defined by the smooth
entropy, which is continuous with the density matrix, the small error of state
actually means small change of security. Then the security of

Transmission electron microscopy showed the dispersed phase to consist of small

flakes consisting of monolayers. These flakes are stabilised against
reaggregation by Coulomb repulsion due to the adsorbed surfactant. However, the
larger flakes tend to sediment out over ~6 weeks, leaving only small flakes
dispersed. It is possible to form thin films by vacuum filtration of these

flakes to be largely free of defects and oxides. The deposited films are
reasonably conductive and are semi-transparent. Further improvements may result
in the development of cheap transparent conductors.

frequencies from the SNR HB 3 using the recently published, corrected, flux
density values. A model including a sum of non-thermal (purely synchrotron) and
thermal (bremsstrahlung) component is applied for fitting integrated radio

density was also estimated to be $n\approx 9 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the

presence of thermal emission at radio frequencies from the SNR so we could
support interaction between SNR HB 3 and adjacent molecular cloud associated

contribution to total volume emissivity at $1 \mathrm{GHz}$ and ambient density

on the magnetic coupling (MC) of a rotating black hole (BH) with its
surrounding disc. The 3:2 HFQPO pairs are interpreted by virtue of the inner
and outer hotspots arising from non-axisymmetric magnetic field, where the
inner hotspot is produced by a torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc,
and the outer hotspot is created by the screw instability of the large-scale
magnetic field. The very steep emissivity index is created predominantly by the
torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc. It turns out that the 3:2 HFQPO
pairs observed in the two sources can be fitted by tuning several model
parameters, such as the BH spin, and the main features of this model lie in
three aspects. (1) The condition for only one HFQPO is discussed based on the
two mechanisms for producing the 3:2 HFQPO pairs, (2) an explanation is given
for a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing
power-law flux as the HFQPO pairs shift from the higher to lower frequencies,
which is consistent with the analysis given by Remillard et al. (2002), and (3)

introduced for better approximation of overspread operators. The Riesz property
of the projection operators involved in generalized Gabor multipliers is

show that the emergence of a clump mass function (CMF) resembling the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) is a ubiquitous feature of molecular cloud
structure, but caution against its over-interpretation. We employ three
different techniques to extract the clumps in this study. In the first two, we
interpolate the SPH particle data to 2 and 3 dimensional grids before
performing the clump-find, using position-position (PP) and
position-position-velocity (PPV) information respectively. In the last
technique, the clump-finding is performed on the SPH data directly, making use
of the full 3 dimensional position information. Although the CMF is typically
similar to that observed in regions of nearby star formation, the individual
clumps and their masses are found to be unreliable since they depend strongly
on the parameters and the method of the clump-finding. In particular we find
that the resolution and orientation of the data make a significant difference
to the resulting properties of the identified clumps in the PP and PPV cases.
We conclude that making comparisons between a CMF and the stellar IMF should be
done with caution, since the definition of a clump boundary, and hence the
number of clumps and their properties, are arbitrary in the extraction method.
This is especially true if molecular clouds are truly scale free.

of cyclic permutations of elements of the genetic code in the genetic
(8x8)-matrix [C A; U G](3) of 64 triplets, where C, A, U, G are letters of the
genetic alphabet. These cyclic permutations lead to such reorganizations of the
matrix form of presentation of the initial genetic Yin-Yang-algebra that arisen
matrices serve as matrix forms of presentations of new Yin-Yang-algebras as
well. They are connected algorithmically with Hadamard matrices. The discovered
existence of a hierarchy of the cyclic changes of types of genetic
Yin-Yang-algebras allows thinking about new algebraic-genetic models of cyclic
processes in inherited biological systems including models of cyclic
metamorphoses of animals. These cycles of changes of the genetic 8-dimensional
algebras and of their 8-dimensional numeric systems have many analogies with
famous facts and doctrines of modern and ancient physiology, medicine, etc.
This viewpoint proposes that the famous idea by Pythagoras (about organization
of natural systems in accordance with harmony of numerical systems) should be
combined with the idea of cyclic changes of Yin-Yang-numeric systems in
considered cases. This second idea reminds of the ancient idea of cyclic
changes in nature. From such algebraic-genetic viewpoint, the notion of
biological time can be considered as a factor of coordinating these
hierarchical ensembles of cyclic changes of types of the genetic
multi-dimensional algebras.

above the Fermi energy in the conductor. A single charge is emitted on an
average time ranging from 100 ps to 10 ns ultimately determined by the barrier
transparency and the dot charging energy. The average single electron emission
process is recorded with a 0.5 ns time resolution using a real-time fast
acquisition card. Single electron signals are compared tosimulation based on

low-frequency radio telescopes to perform high resolution observations across

broadband full signal cross-correlations on time intervals of up to hundreds of
milliseconds. METHODS: Broadband VLBI observations at about 20 MHz on a
baseline of ~50000 wavelengths were performed to achieve arcsecond angular
resolution. LOFAR's Initial Test Station (LOFAR/ITS, The Netherlands) and the
Nancay Decametric Array (NDA, France) digitize the measured electric field with
12 bit and 14 bit in a 40 MHz baseband. The fine structure in Jupiter's signal
was used for data synchronization prior to correlation on the time-series data.
RESULTS: Strong emission from Jupiter was detected during snapshots of a few
seconds and detailed features down to microsecond time-scales were identified
in dynamic spectra. Correlations of Jupiter's burst emission returned strong
fringes on 1 ms time-scales over channels as narrow as a hundred kilohertz
bandwidth. CONCLUSIONS: Long baseline interferometry is confirmed at low
frequencies, in spite of phase shifts introduced by variations in ionospheric
propagation characteristics. Phase coherence was preserved over tens to
hundreds of milliseconds with a baseline of ~700 km. No significant variation
with time was found in the correlations and an estimate for the fringe
visibility of 1, suggested that the source was not resolved. The upper limit on
the source region size of Jupiter Io-B S-bursts corresponds to an angular
resolution of ~3 arcsec. Adding remote stations to the LOFAR network at
baselines up to thousand kilometers will provide 10 times higher resolution
down to an arcsecond.

opposition to that paper, the current approach involves also auxiliary fields
and holds for arbitrary n-dimensional spacetimes. Dirac's canonical analysis
for the actions is detailedly carried out in the generic case and it is shown
that these action principles define topological field theories, as mentioned.
The current formalism is a generic framework to construct geometric theories
with local degrees of freedom by introducing additional constraints on the
various fields involved that destroy the topological character of the original
theory. The latter idea is implemented in two-dimensional spacetimes where
gravity coupled to matter fields is constructed out, which has indeed local

the geometry of the air shower radio emission measured with LOPES and search
for systematic effects between the direction determined on the radio signal and
the direction provided by the particle detector array KASCADE. METHODS: We
produce 4D radio images on time-scales of nanoseconds using digital
beam-forming. Each pixel of the image is calculated for three spatial
dimensions and as a function of time. The third spatial dimension is obtained
by calculating the beam focus for a range of curvature radii fitted to the
signal wave front. We search this multi-dimensional parameter space for the
direction of maximum coherence of the air shower radio signal and compare it to
the direction provided by KASCADE. RESULTS: The maximum radio emission of air
showers is obtained for curvature radii being larger than 3 km. We find that
the direction of the emission maximum can change when optimizing the curvature
radius. Furthermore, we find a tentative increase of the curvature radius to
lower elevations, where the air showers pass through a larger atmospheric
depth. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the angular resolution of LOPES is
sufficient to determine the direction which maximizes the observed electric
field amplitude. However, the statistical uncertainty of the directions is not
determined by the resolution of LOPES, but by the uncertainty of the curvature
radius. We do not find any systematic deviation between the directions
determined from the radio signal and from the detected particles. This result
places a strong supportive argument for the use of the radio technique to study
the origin of high-energy cosmic rays.

and searching for weak metal lines in the far UV. We performed a detailed

  A strong contamination of the far-UV spectrum of LB 3459 by interstellar line
