scalar fields, determining, in agreement with previous studies, that many such
solutions contain naked timelike singularities. Vacuum bubble solutions of this
type do not contain a region of true vacuum, obstructing the ability of eternal
inflation to populate other vacua. We determine a criterion that potentials
must satisfy to avoid the existence of such singularities, and show that many
domain wall solutions in Type IIB string theory are singular. This has profound
implications for applying the program of eternal inflation to making
predictions in the string theory landscape.

cosmic-ray air showers around 100 PeV (1017 eV). METHODS: We observe short
radio pulses in a broad frequency band with the dipole-interferometer LOPES
(LOFAR Prototype Station), which is triggered by a particle detector array
named Karlsruhe Shower Core and Array Detector (KASCADE). LOFAR is the Low
Frequency Array. For this analysis, 23 strong air shower events are selected
using parameters from KASCADE. RESULTS: The resulting electric field spectra
fall off to higher frequencies. An average electric field spectrum is fitted
with an exponential, or alternatively, with a power law. The spectral slope
obtained is not consistent within uncertainties and it is slightly steeper than
the slope obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on air showers simulated
with CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray Simulations for KASCADE). One of the strongest events
was measured during thunderstorm activity in the vicinity of LOPES and shows
the longest pulse length measured of 110 ns and a spectral slope of -3.6.
CONCLUSIONS: We show with two different methods that frequency spectra from air
shower radio emission can be reconstructed on event-by-event basis, with only
two dozen dipole antennae simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies.
According to the obtained spectral slopes, the maximum power is emitted below
40 MHz. Furthermore, the decrease in power to higher frequencies indicates a
loss in coherence determined by the shower disc thickness. We conclude that a
broader bandwidth, larger collecting area, and longer baselines, as will be
provided by LOFAR, are necessary to further investigate the relation of the
coherence, pulse length, and spectral slope of cosmic ray air showers.

measurements. However, reports of deviations of reduced-neutron-width
distributions from the expected Porter-Thomas (PT) shape largely have been
ignored. Most of these deviations have been reported for odd-A nuclides.
Because reliable spin (J) assignments have been absent for most resonances for
such nuclides, it is possible that reported deviations from PT might be due to
incorrect J assignments. We recently developed a new method for measuring spins
of neutron resonances by using the DANCE detector at LANSCE. Measurements made
with a 147Sm sample allowed us to determine spins of almost all known
resonances below 1 keV. Furthermore, analysis of these data revealed that the
reduced-neutron-width distribution was in good agreement with PT for resonances
below 350 eV, but in disagreement with PT for resonances between 350 and 700
eV. Our previous (n,alpha) measurements had revealed that the alpha strength
function also changes abruptly at this energy. There currently is no known
explanation for these two non-statistical effects. Recently, we have developed
another new method for determining the spins of neutron resonances. To
implement this technique required a small change (to record pulse-height
information for coincidence events) to a much simpler apparatus: A pair of C6D6
gamma-ray detectors which we have employed for many years to measure
neutron-capture cross sections at ORELA. Measurements with a 95Mo sample
revealed that not only does the method work very well for determining spins,
but it also makes possible parity assignments. Taken together, these new
techniques at LANSCE and ORELA could be very useful for further elucidation of
non-statistical effects.

fall from Earth-crossing orbits with V = 30-50 km/s and undergo multiple
interaction with condensed matter already in its outer layers, on a path of a
few tens of cm. Therefore, one should use not compact massive detectors but
rather systems with a large surface area, as we did to detect daemons with thin
ZnS(Ag) scintillators. There are grounds to believe that correct use of the

living organisms. Many cellular forces, e.g. those generated in cyclic

However, little is known about how proteins process repetitive mechanical
stresses. To obtain first insights into dynamic protein mechanics, we probed
the mechanical stability of single and multimeric ubiquitins perturbed by
periodic forces. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we were
able to model repetitive forces with periods about two orders of magnitude
longer than the relaxation time of folded ubiquitins. We found that even a
small periodic force weakened the protein and shifted its unfolding pathways in
a frequency- and amplitude-dependent manner. Our results also showed that the
dynamic response of even a small protein can be complex with transient
refolding of secondary structures and an increasing importance of local
interactions in asymmetric protein stability. These observations were
qualitatively and quantitatively explained using an energy landscape model and
discussed in the light of dynamic single-molecule measurements and
physiological forces. We believe that our approach and results provide first
steps towards a framework to better understand dynamic protein biomechanics and
biological force generation.

M/L_V = 1320^{+2680}_{-940}. The error distribution of the mass-to-light ratio

detect changes of the X-ray flux by a factor of 3 accompanied by changes in the
X-ray spectra. We believe that this X-ray emission originates from wind-wind
collision in a massive binary system. The observed changes can be explained by
the variations in the emission measure of the hot plasma, and by the different
absorption column along the binary orbit. The X-ray spectra of WR 65 display
prominent emission features at wavelengths corresponding to the lines of
strongly ionized Fe, Ca, Ar, S, Si, and Mg. WR 65 is a carbon rich WC9d star
that is a persistent dust maker. This is the first investigation of any X-ray
spectrum for a star of this spectral type. There are indications that the dust
and the complex geometry of the colliding wind region are pivotal in explaining
the X-ray properties of WR 65.

10^7 to 10^8 Msun and half mass radii of 10-100 pc. They have some properties
in common with massive globular clusters, however dynamical mass estimates have
shown that UCDs have mass-to-light ratios which are on average about twice as
large than those of globular clusters at comparable metallicity, and tend to be
larger than what one would expect for old stellar systems with standard mass
functions.
  One possible explanation for elevated high mass-to-light ratios in UCDs is
the existence of a substantial amount of dark matter, which could have ended up
in UCDs if they are the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies.
Tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies has also been suggested has the origin of
several massive globular clusters like Omega Cen, in which case globular
clusters could have also formed with substantial amounts of dark matter.
  In this paper, we present collisional N-body simulations which study the
co-evolution of a system composed out of stars and dark matter. We find that
the dark matter gets removed from the central regions of such systems due to
dynamical friction and mass segregation of stars. The friction timescale is
significantly shorter than a Hubble time for typical globular clusters, while
most UCDs have friction times much longer than a Hubble time. Therefore, a
significant dark matter fraction remains within the half-mass radius of
present-day UCDs, making dark matter a viable explanation for the elevated M/L
ratios of UCDs. If at least some globular clusters formed in a way similar to
UCDs, we predict a substantial amount of dark matter in their outer parts.

merger epoch permeated by interactions with a DM substructure (subhalos). A
long-lived bar is triggered by a tide from a subhalo and survives for ~10 Gyr.
The evolution of this bar is followed during the subsequent numerous minor
mergers and interactions with the substructure. Together with intrinsic
factors, these interactions largely determine the stellar bar evolution. The
bar strength and its pattern speed anticorrelate, except during interactions
and when the secondary (nuclear) bar is present. For about 5 Gyr bar pattern
speed increases substantially despite the loss of angular momentum to stars and
cuspy DM halo. We analyze the evolution of stellar populations in the bar-disk

intermediate age, ~5-6 Gyr, disk stars at z=0, a secondary nuclear bar which

the effect of D abundance on the gas cooling. The D abundance was set initially
to be in the range n_{D}/n_{H}=10^{-7}-10^{-4.5}, with
n_{HD}/n_{H}={D^{+}}/n_{H}=10^{-10}. The simulations show that at

Lester (2008), of pulsation-driven mass loss for Cepheids is applied to
theoretical models of Cepheids with metallicity consistent with the Milky Way
and Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The mass-loss model is analyzed using
the metallicity correction of the Period-Luminosity relation to compare the
ratio of mass loss of Cepheids with lower metallicity to that of Cepheids with
solar metallicity. It is determined that mass loss may be larger for the lower
metallicity Cepheids, counterintuitive to radiative driving estimates. Also the
mass-loss rates of theoretical Cepheid models are found to be up to $5\times
10^{-9}$ for Galactic Cepheids, $5\times 10^{-8}$ for Large Magellanic Cloud
Cepheids, and $2\times 10^{-7}M_\odot /yr$ for Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids.
It is argued that mass loss increases as metallicity decreases for Cepheids
with periods less than 20 days and that mass loss decreases for longer periods.
Assuming dust forms in the wind of a Cepheid at some distance, the infrared
excess of the models is computed, finding the infrared brightness is
approximately a magnitude larger due to mass loss. The infrared magnitudes are
compared to recently published Period-Luminosity relations as a test of our
predictions.

the red sequence.
  The spatial distribution of the 15 micron galaxies over ~200 arcmin^2 around
the cluster reveals that few 15 micron galaxies are detected in the cluster
central region. This is probably due to the low star forming activity in the
cluster core. However, interestingly, the fraction of 15 micron galaxies in the
medium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite the
fact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-density
environments. Furthermore, we find that 15 micron galaxies which have optically
red colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specific
star formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment.
These results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups and
filaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to the

connected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as the

the properties of each component are remarkably constant as a function of

find that, although the mass functions of the gravity-only (GO) treatments are

to the GO case, the masses of ~10^{14} Msun/h halos in the PH and CSF

properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased
diffusivity on compression, they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral
amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon and carbon is the
formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to
develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with
tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the
hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond
angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model
departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged
forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW
has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and
structure of liquid water, its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable
or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less
than 1% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the
interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the
structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time
provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in
deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying
transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of
biomolecules and complex materials.

of the bands was achieved using photometry from the NACO imaging data. We
conclude that the CT Cha companion is a very low-mass member of Chamaeleon and
very likely a physical companion to CT Cha, as the probability for a by chance
alignment is <=0.01. Due to a prominent Pa-Beta emission in the J-band,
accretion is probably still ongoing onto the CT Cha companion. From temperature

perturbation theory to calculate accurately the gravitational waves emanating
from the end of the plunging stage of an extreme mass ratio merger in order to
further understand this phenomenon. This study focuses primarily on spin
induced effects with emphasis on the maximally spinning limit and the
identification of possible causes of generic behavior.
  We find that gravitational waves emitted during the plunging phase exhibit
damped oscillatory behavior, corresponding to a coherent excitation of
quasi-normal modes by the test particle. This feature is universal in the sense
that the frequencies and damping time do not depend on the orbital parameters
of the plunging particle. Furthermore, the observed frequencies are distinct
from those associated with the usual free quasi-normal ringing. Our calculation
suggests that a maximum in radiated energy and momentum occurs at spin
parameters equal to $a/M=0.86$ and $a/M=0.81$, respectively for the plunge
stage of a polar orbit. The dependence of linear momentum emission on the angle
at which a polar orbit impacts the horizon is quantified. One of the advantages
of the perturbation approach adopted here is that insight into the actual
mechanism of radiation emission and its relationship to black hole ringing is
obtained by carefully identifying the dominant terms in the expansions used.

observational implications for this process. The conditions required for the
major production of the heavy r-process elements (r-elements) with mass numbers
A >130 are discussed based on a generic astrophysical model where matter
adiabatically expands from a hot and dense initial state. Nucleosynthesis in
the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars is discussed as a specific
example. Such winds readily produce the elements from Sr to Ag with A ~ 88 to
110 through charged-particle reactions in the alpha-process but appear
incapable of making the heavy r-elements. Observations of elemental abundances
in metal-poor stars have provided many valuable insights into the r-process.
They have demonstrated that the production of the heavy r-elements must be
associated with massive stars evolving on short timescales, provided evidence
strongly favoring core-collapse supernovae over neutron star mergers as the
major source for these elements, and shown that this source cannot produce any
significant amount of the low-A elements from Na to Ge including Fe. A
self-consistent astrophysical model of the r-process remains to be developed,
and it appears well worthwhile to carry out more comprehensive studies on the
evolution and explosion of the massive stars of ~ 8 to 11 M_sun that undergo
O-Ne-Mg core collapse and produce a very insignificant amount of the low-A

low-mass and normal supernovae (SNe) from progenitors of ~ 8 to 11 M_sun and ~
12 to 25 M_sun, respectively. Using this rule and attributing all Fe production
to normal SNe, we previously developed a phenomenological two-component model,
which predicts that [Sr/Fe] > -0.32 for all metal-poor stars. This is in direct
conflict with the high-resolution data now available, which show that there is
a great shortfall of Sr relative to Fe in many stars with [Fe/H] < -3. The same
conflict also exists for the CPR elements Y and Zr. We show that the data
require a stellar source leaving behind black holes and that hypernovae (HNe)
from progenitors of ~ 25 to 50 M_sun are the most plausible candidates. If we
expand our previous model to include three components (low-mass and normal SNe
and HNe), we find that essentially all of the data are very well described by
the new model. The HN yield pattern for the low-A elements from Na through Zn
(including Fe) is inferred from the stars deficient in Sr, Y, and Zr. We
estimate that HNe contributed ~ 24% of the bulk solar Fe inventory while normal
SNe contributed only ~ 9% (not the usually assumed ~ 33%). This implies a
greatly reduced role of normal SNe in the chemical evolution of the low-A
elements.

from the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). Four sources with moderate
L_X(~several*10^-6 L_Edd) are complicated. The X-ray emission of one FR I is
from the jet, and the other three is from the sum of the jet and ADAF. The
X-ray emission in the three least luminous sources (L_X<1.0*10^-6L_Edd) is
dominated by the jet. These results roughly support the predictions of Yuan and
Cui(2005) where they predict that when the X-ray luminosity of the system is
below a critical value, the X-radiation will not be dominated by the emission

L user broadcast channel there are 2L - 1 subsets of receivers and
correspondingly 2L - 1 independent messages. The set of achievable rates for
this channel is a 2L - 1 dimensional region. There are fundamental constraints

able to simultaneously send L rate-one private messages, error-free to all
receivers, then by sending the same information in each message, it must be
able to send a single rate-one common message, error-free to all receivers.
This swapping of private and common messages illustrates that for any broadcast
channel, the inclusion of a point R* in the achievable rate region implies the
achievability of a set of other points that are not merely component-wise less
than R*. We formerly define this set and characterize it for L = 2 and L = 3.
Whereas for L = 2 all the points in the set arise only from operations relating

(presumably unlicensed) frequency band. Pairs within a given network cooperate
to schedule transmissions, but between networks there is competition for
spectrum. To make the problem tractable, we assume transmissions are scheduled
according to a random access protocol where each network chooses an access
probability for its users. A game between the two networks is defined. We
characterize the Nash Equilibrium behavior of the system. Three regimes are
identified; one in which both networks simultaneously schedule all
transmissions; one in which the denser network schedules all transmissions and
the sparser only schedules a fraction; and one in which both networks schedule
only a fraction of their transmissions. The regime of operation depends on the
pathloss exponent $\alpha$, the latter regime being desirable, but attainable
only for $\alpha>4$. This suggests that in certain environments, rival wireless
networks may end up naturally cooperating. To substantiate our analytical
results, we simulate a system where networks iteratively optimize their access
probabilities in a greedy manner. We also discuss a distributed scheduling
protocol that employs carrier sensing, and demonstrate via simulations, that
again a near cooperative equilibrium exists for sufficiently large $\alpha$.

the charge transfer energy and slightly suppresses J. It is further shown that

theory generally accounts for the averaged effects of long-ranged components of
the intermolecular interactions by using an effective or restructured external
field. The derivation starts from the exact Yvon-Born-Green hierarchy and shows
that the approximation can be very accurate when the interactions averaged over
are slowly varying at characteristic nearest-neighbor distances. Application of
LMF theory to Coulomb interactions alone allows for great simplifications of
the governing equations. LMF theory then reduces to a single equation for a
restructured electrostatic potential that satisfies Poisson's equation defined
with a smoothed charge density. Because of this charge smoothing by a Gaussian
of width sigma, this equation may be solved more simply than the detailed
simulation geometry might suggest. Proper choice of the smoothing length sigma
plays a major role in ensuring the accuracy of this approximation. We examine
the results of a basic confinement of water between corrugated wall and justify
the simple LMF equation used in a previous publication. We further generalize
these results to confinements that include fixed charges in order to
demonstrate the broader impact of charge smoothing by sigma. The slowly-varying
part of the restructured electrostatic potential will be more symmetric than
the local details of confinements.

such hidden states through an invisibly decaying Z' at the LHC. We focus on the
process pp -> \gamma Z' -> \gamma X X*, where X is any neutral, (quasi-) stable

complements a previous study using pp -> Z Z' -> l+ l- X X*. Only the Z' mass

invisibly only to Standard Model neutrinos, then these charges are predicted by
observation of the Z' through the Drell-Yan process, allowing discrimination
between Z' decays to SM neutrinos and invisible decays to new states. We
carefully discuss all backgrounds and systematic errors that affect this

approach here specifically to analyze waveguide junctions. We show that the

consists of real and complex discrete eigenvalue spectra, as well as the
continuous spectrum--forms a complete basis set. We provide the derivation of
these modes using the techniques developed for Sturm-Liouville and generalized

spectrum to have a complete set of basis vectors to describe scattering within
MIM waveguides with the mode-matching technique. We numerically compare the
mode-matching formulation with finite-difference frequency-domain analysis and
find very good agreement between the two for modal scattering at symmetric MIM
waveguide junctions. We touch upon the similarities between the underlying
mathematical structure of the MIM waveguide and the PT symmetric quantum
mechanical pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The rich set of modes that the MIM
waveguide supports forms a canonical example against which other more
complicated geometries can be compared. Our work here encompasses the microwave

not associated with the clusters but background galaxies based on some external

obtained with the IRC if possible. The SEDs suggest that most of the point
sources are background galaxies. We find one candidate of the intracluster dust
which has no mid-infrared counterpart unlike the other point-like sources,
although some features such as its point-like appearance should be explained

planetesimals found in mean motion resonances is reduced and planetary
migration rates are on average about 50% slower when gravitational interactions
between the planetesimals are computed than when planetesimal self-gravity is
neglected. This is likely due to gravitational stirring of the planetesimal
disk that is not present when self-gravity is neglected that reduces their
capture efficiency because of the increased particle eccentricity dispersion.
We find that migration is more stochastic when the disk is self-gravitating or
comprised of more massive bodies. Previous studies have found that if the
planetesimal disk density is below a critical level, migration is ""damped"" and
the migration rate decays exponentially, otherwise it is ""forced"" and the
planet's migration rate could accelerate exponentially. Migration rates
measured from our undamped simulations suggest that the migration rate
saturates at a level proportional to disk density and subsequently is

We show, however, that if in addition some system parameters are varied
adiabatically, such transitions become possible via adiabatic-change-induced
excitations to other states. We demonstrate that full amplitude transfer
between the two decoupled states can be achieved, and more significantly, the
evolution of the system only depends on its path in parameter space. Our
technique then provides a valuable means of studying nontrivial geometrical

equation approach that considers direct, steric and thermal forces. As three
model systems with distinctly different properties we consider the pairs
barnase:barstar, cytochrome c:cytochrome c peroxidase and p53:MDM2. In each
case, proteins are modeled either as spherical particles, as dipolar spheres or
as collection of several small beads with one dipole. Spherical reaction
patches are placed on the model proteins according to the known experimental
structures of the protein complexes. In the computer simulations, concentration
is varied by changing box size. Encounter is defined as overlap of the reaction
patches and the corresponding first passage times are recorded together with
the number of unsuccessful contacts before encounter. We find that encounter
frequency scales linearly with protein concentration, thus proving that our
microscopic model results in a well-defined macroscopic encounter rate. The
number of unsuccessful contacts before encounter decreases with increasing
encounter rate and ranges from 20-9000. For all three models, encounter rates
are obtained within one order of magnitude of the experimentally measured
association rates. Electrostatic steering enhances association up to 50-fold.
If diffusional encounter is dominant (p53:MDM2) or similarly important as
electrostatic steering (barnase:barstar), then encounter rate decreases with
decreasing patch radius. More detailed modeling of protein shapes decreases
encounter rates by 5-95 percent. Our study shows how generic principles of
protein-protein association are modulated by molecular features of the systems
under consideration. Moreover it allows us to assess different coarse-graining
strategies for the future modelling of the dynamics of large protein complexes.

convectively unstable. But the SCZ is also in a state of differential rotation,
and its dynamical stability properties are those of a weakly magnetized gas.
This renders it far more prone to rapidly growing rotational baroclinic
instabilities than a hydrodynamical system would be. These instabilities should
be treated on the same footing as convective instabilites. If isentropic and
isorotational surfaces coincide in the SCZ, the gas is marginally (un)stable to
{\em both} convective and rotational disturbances. This is a plausible
resolution for the instabilities associated with these more general rotating
convective systems. This motivates an analysis of the thermal wind equation in
which isentropes and isorotational surfaces are identical. The characteristics
of this partial differential equation correspond to isorotation contours, and
their form may be deduced even without precise knowledge of how the entropy and
rotation are functionally related. Although the exact solution of the global
SCZ problem in principle requires this knowledge, even the simplest models
produce striking results in broad agreement with helioseismology data. This
includes horizontal (i.e. quasi-spherical) isorotational contours at the poles,
axial contours at the equator, and approximately radial contours at
midlatitudes. The theory does not apply directly to the tachocline, where a
simple thermal wind balance is not expected to be valid. The work presented
here is subject to tests of self-consistency, among them the prediction that
there should be good agreement between isentropes and isorotational contours in
sufficiently well-resolved large scale numerical MHD simulations.

where a mysterious HO transition occurs at 17.5K. For more than twenty years

surprisingly large Fermi surface gapping. As mechanism for the HO we propose
spontaneous symmetry breaking through collective antiferromagnetic moment

called here a modified hybrid model, proposed in this 2n-dimensional
generalization and considers the canonical formalism for this model. For the
sake of convenience, the canonical formalism itself is studied for a model
equivalent to the modified hybrid model by following the recipe for treating
constrained Hamiltonian systems. This formalism is applied to the canonical
quantization of the equivalent model in order to clarify observable and
unobservable particles in the model. The equivalent model (with a gauge-fixing
term) is converted to the modified hybrid model (with a corresponding
gauge-fixing term) in a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)-invariant manner.
Thereby it is shown that the Chern-Pontryagin density behaves as an observable
massive particle (or field). The topological mass generation is thus verified
at the quantum-theoretical level.

functions. The terms of such series are often called modes. A master- (or
determining) mode set is a subset of these modes, the time history of which
uniquely determines the time history of the entire turbulent flow provided that
this flow is developed. In the present work the existence of the
master-mode-set is demonstrated numerically for turbulent channel flow. The
minimal size of a master-mode set and the rate of the process of the recovery
of the entire flow from the master-mode set history are estimated. The velocity
field corresponding to the minimal master-mode set is found to be a good
approximation for mean velocity in the entire flow field. Mean characteristics
involving velocity derivatives deviate in a very close vicinity to the wall,
while master-mode two-point correlations exhibit unrealistic oscillations. This
can be improved by using a larger than minimal master-mode set. The near-wall
streaks are found to be contained in the velocity field corresponding to the
minimal master-mode set, and the same is true at least for the large-scale part
of the longitudinal vorticity structure. A database containing the time history
of a master-mode set is demonstrated to be an efficient tool for investigating
rare events in turbulent flows. In particular, a travelling-wave-like object
was identified on the basis of the analysis of the database. Two

Holographically, the entropy is determined by a minimal surface. On the gravity

two solutions to the surfaces determining the entanglement entropy. In the case
of $AdS_3$, the calculation reproduces precisely the geometric entropy of an

chemistry of the ISM. However, accurate surface chemistry models are
computationally expensive and are difficult to integrate with gas-phase
simulations. A new modified-rate method for solving grain-surface chemical
systems is presented. Its purpose is accurately to model highly complex systems
that can otherwise only be treated using the sometimes inadequate rate-equation
approach. In contrast to previous rate-modification techniques, the functional
form of the surface production rates was modified, and not simply the rate
coefficient. This form is appropriate to the extreme ""small-grain"" limit, and
can be verified using an analytical master-equation approach. Various further
modifications were made to this basic form, to account for competition between
processes, to improve estimates of surface occupation probabilities, and to
allow a switch-over to the normal rate equations where these are applicable.
The new method was tested against systems solved previously using exact
techniques. Even the simplest method is quite accurate, and a great improvement
over rate equations. Further modifications allow the master-equation results to
be reproduced exactly for the methanol-producing system, within computational
accuracy. Small discrepancies arise when non-zero activation energies are
assumed for the methanol system, which result from complex reaction-competition
processes that cannot be resolved easily without using exact methods.
Inaccuracies in computed abundances are never greater than a few tens of
percent, and typically of the order of one percent, in the most complex systems
tested. Implementation of the method in simple networks, including
hydrogen-only systems, is trivial, whilst the results are highly accurate.

variability on timescales of a few hours or less is rare, and there exist very
few sources that show large-amplitude variations on a timescale as short as
what is now observed for 1156+295. The shape of the visibility function of the
source changes very little during the observation, although the correlated flux
density changes by 40%. This suggests that the variability occurs in a single
dominant compact component. The observed variability characteristics are
consistent with interstellar scintillation in nearby, highly turbulent medium.
The rms amplitude of modulation at 15 GHz is unusually large and it implies a
rather high scattering measure along the line-of-sight towards 1156+295.
