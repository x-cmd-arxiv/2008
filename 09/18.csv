  Modified Gravity","submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The redshift evolution of the Tully-Fisher Relation probes gravitational
dynamics that must be consistent with any modified gravity theory seeking to
explain the galactic rotation curves without the need for dark matter. Within
the context of non-relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the
characteristic acceleration scale of the theory appears to be related to the
current value of either the Hubble constant, i.e., alpha ~ cH_0, or the dark
energy density, i.e., alpha (8 pi G rho_lambda/3)^{1/2}. If these relations are
the manifestation of a fundamental coupling of a_0 to either of the two
cosmological parameters, the cosmological evolution would then dictate a
particular dependence of the MOND acceleration scale with redshift that can be
tested with Tully-Fisher relations of high-redshift galaxies. We compare this
prediction to two sets of Tully-Fisher data with redshifts up to z=1.2. We find
that both couplings are excluded within the formal uncertainties. However, when
we take into account the potential systematic uncertainties in the data, we
find that they marginally favor the coupling of the MOND acceleration scale to
the density of dark energy.

CP(1) model -- a theory of bosonic spinons coupled to an abelian gauge field.
Monopole defects of the gauge field play a prominent role in the physics of
this phase transition. In the present paper, we use the state-operator
correspondence of conformal field theory in conjunction with the 1/N expansion
to study monopole operators at the critical fixed point of the CP(N-1) model.
This elegant method reproduces the result for monopole scaling dimension

The general-relativistic hydrostatic equations are generalized to spherical
objects with multiple fluids that interact by gravity. We use the minimal
parity-symmetric extension of the standard model, which implies that the
microphysics is the same in the two sectors. We find that the mass-radius
relation is significantly modified in the presence of a few percent mirror
baryons. This effect mimics that of other exotica, e.g., quark matter. In
contrast to the common view that the neutron-star equilibrium sequence is
unique, we show that it depends on the relative number of mirror baryons to
ordinary baryons. It is therefore history dependent. The critical mass for core
collapse, i.e., the process by which neutron stars are created, is modified in
the presence of mirror baryons. We calculate the modified Chandrasekhar mass
and fit it with a polynomial. A few percent mirror baryons is sufficient to
lower the critical mass for core collapse by ~0.1 M_sun. This could allow for
the formation of extraordinary compact neutron stars with low mass.

collective excitations and quasiparticles. Excitation of quasiparticles
requires the frequency of the perturbation to exceed the energy gap. Thus, by
tuning the gap, the frequencies of the field may be selectively monitored from
the amount of quasiparticles which is measurable for instance by
RF-spectroscopy. We analyse the proposed method by calculating the
density-density susceptibility, i.e. the dynamic structure factor, of the gas.

der Waals and hydrogen bonds. At ultralow temperatures a novel binding type
emerges paving the way for novel molecules and ultracold chemistry [1,2]. The
underlying mechanism for this new type of chemical bond is low-energy electron
scattering of Rydberg electrons from polarisable ground state atoms [3]. This
quantum scattering process can generate an attractive potential that is able to
bind the ground state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well localized position
within the Rydberg electron wave function. The resulting giant molecules can
have an internuclear separation of several thousand Bohr radii, which places
them among the largest known molecules to date. Their binding energies are much
smaller than the Kepler frequencies of the Rydberg electrons i.e. the atomic
Rydberg electron state is essentially unchanged by the bound ground state atom.
Ultracold and dense samples of atoms enable the creation of these molecules via
Rydberg excitation. In this paper we present spectroscopic evidence for the
vibrational ground and first excited state of a Rubidium dimer Rb(5S)-Rb(nS).
We apply a Born-Oppenheimer model to explain the measured binding energies for
principal quantum numbers n between 34 and 40 and extract the s-wave scattering
length for electron-Rb(5S) scattering in the relevant low energy regime Ekin <
100 meV. We also determine the lifetimes and the polarisabilities of these
molecules. P-wave bound states [2], Trimer states [4] as well as bound states
for large angular momentum of the Rydberg electron - socalled trilobite
molecules [1] - are within reach in the near future and will further refine our
conceptual understanding of the chemical bond.

any case, he attempted the test with the acquiescence and financial support of
the Argentine state, and as a leading member of its official scientific elite.
We contrast his very specific and strictly scientific efforts with those of our
second astronomer, Jos\'e Ubach, SJ, a secondary school teacher of science at a
leading Buenos Aires Catholic school who reported in response to Eddington's

extrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they

been shown recently that, in the scale range from the onset of nonlinear
evolution to dissipation, the velocity and mass density fields of cosmic baryon
fluid are extremely well described by the She-Leveque's scaling formula, which
is due to the log-Poisson hierarchical cascade. Since the mass density ratio
between ionized hydrogen to total hydrogen is not uniform in space, the mass
density field of neutral hydrogen component is not given by a similar mapping
of total baryon fluid. Nevertheless, we show, with hydrodynamic simulation
samples of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM universe, that the mass density field
of neutral hydrogen, is also well described by the log-Poisson hierarchy. We
then investigate the field of Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux of QSO absorption
spectrum. Due to redshift distortion, Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux fluctuations
are no longer to show all features of the log-Poisson hierarchy. However, some
non-Gaussian features predicted by the log-Poisson hierarchy are not affected
by the redshift distortion. We test these predictions with the high resolution
and high S/N data of quasars Ly$\alpha$ absorption spectra. All results given
by real data, including $\beta$-hierarchy, high order moments and scale-scale
correlation, are found to be well consistent with the log-Poisson hierarchy. We
compare the log-Poisson hierarchy with the popular log-normal model of the
Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux. The later is found to yield too strong
non-Gaussianity at high orders, while the log-Poisson hierarchy is in agreement

unaffected by microlensing on a time scale of a few months. Microlensing in A &
B goes with chromatic variations of the quasar continuum. We observe stronger
micro-amplification in the blue than in the red part of the spectrum, as
expected for continuum emission arising from a standard accretion disk.
Microlensing induced variations of the CIII] emission are observed both in the
integrated line intensity and profile. Finally, we also find that images C & D
are about 0.1-0.3 mag redder than images A & B. The spectra of images A-B-C in
J1131-1231 reveal that, in April 2003, microlensing was at work in images A and
C. We find that microlensing de-amplifies the continuum emission and the Broad
Line Region (BLR) in these images. Contrary to the case of Q2237+0305, we do
not find evidence for chromatic microlensing of the continuum emission. On the
other hand, we observe that the Balmer and MgII broad line profiles are
deformed by microlensing. These deformations imply an anti-correlation between
the width of the emission line and the size of the corresponding emitting
region. Finally, the differential microlensing of the FeII emission suggests
that the bulk of FeII is emitted in the outer parts of the BLR while another
fraction of FeII is produced in a compact region.

Furthermore, they seem to rule out effective radii significantly greater than

faint, hydrogen-burning stars. The optical/near-infrared colours of these red
halos have proved very difficult to reconcile with any normal type of stellar
population, but can in principle be explained by advocating a bottom-heavy
stellar initial mass function. This implies a high stellar mass-to-light ratio
and hence a substantial baryonic mass locked up in such halos. Here, we explore
the constraints imposed by current observations of ordinary stellar halo
subdwarfs on a putative red halo of low-mass stars around the Milky Way.
Assuming structural parameters similar to those of the red halo recently
detected in stacked images of external disk galaxies, we find that a smooth
halo component with a bottom-heavy initial mass function is completely ruled
out by current star count data for the Milky Way. All viable smooth red halo
models with a density slope even remotely similar to that of the stacked halo
moreover contain far too little mass to have any bearing on the missing-baryon
problem. However, we note that these constraints can be sidestepped if the red
halo stars are locked up in star clusters, and discuss potential observations
of other nearby galaxies that may be able to put such scenarios to the test.

orbital separations > 3-10 AU. On the other hand, previous radial velocity
surveys of brown dwarfs are mainly sensitive to separations smaller than 0.6
AU. It has been speculated that the peak of the separation distribution of
brown dwarf binaries lies right in the unprobed range. This work extends
high-precision radial velocity surveys of brown dwarfs for the first time out
to 3 AU. Based on more than six years UVES/VLT spectroscopy the binary
frequency of brown dwarfs and (very) low-mass stars (M4.25-M8) in ChaI was
determined: 18% for the whole sample and 10% for the subsample of ten brown
dwarfs and VLMS (M < 0.1 Msun). Two spectroscopic binaries were confirmed, the
brown dwarf candidate ChaHa8 (previously discovered by Joergens & Mueller) and
the low-mass star CHXR74. Since their orbital separations appear to be 1 AU or
greater, the binary frequency at < 1 AU might be less than 10%. Now for the
first time companion searches of (young) brown dwarfs cover the whole orbital
separation range, and the following observational constraints for models of
brown dwarf formation can be derived: (i) the frequency of brown dwarf and very
low-mass stellar binaries at < 3 AU does not significantly exceed that at > 3
AU; i.e. direct imaging surveys do not miss a significant fraction of brown
dwarf binaries; (ii) the overall binary frequency of brown dwarfs and very
low-mass stars is 10-30 %; (iii) the decline in the separation distribution of
brown dwarfs towards smaller separations seems to occur between 1 and 3 AU;
(iv) the observed continuous decrease in the binary frequency from the stellar

continuous formation mechanism from low-mass stars to brown dwarfs.

`soft state' of the black hole candidate 4U1957+11. These spectra, having a
minimally discernible hard X-ray excess, are an excellent test of modern disk
atmosphere models that include the effects of black hole spin. The HETG data
show that the soft disk spectrum is only very mildly absorbed with N_H =1-2 X
10^{21} cm^-2. These data additionally reveal 13.449 A NeIX absorption
consistent with the warm/hot phase of the interstellar medium. The fitted disk
model implies a highly inclined disk around a low mass black hole rapidly
rotating with normalized spin a*~1. We show, however, that pure Schwarzschild
black hole models describe the data extremely well, albeit with large disk
atmosphere ``color-correction'' factors. Standard color-correction factors can
be attained if one additionally incorporates mild Comptonization. We find that
the Chandra observations do not uniquely determine spin. Similarly, XMM/RXTE
observations, taken only six weeks later, are equally unconstraining. This lack
of constraint is partly driven by the unknown mass and unknown distance of
4U1957+11; however, it is also driven by the limited bandpass of Chandra and
XMM. We therefore present a series of 48 RXTE observations taken over the span
of several years and at different brightness/hardness levels. These data prefer
a spin of a*~1, even when including a mild Comptonization component; however,
they also show evolution of the disk atmosphere color-correction factors. If
the rapid spin models with standard atmosphere color-correction factors of
h_d=1.7 are to be believed, then the RXTE observations predict that 4U1957+11

excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen
survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood, and a good fit to the local Hess
diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the
age-metallicity plane although this plane was not used in the fitting process.
Although this model's star-formation rate is monotonic declining, its disc
naturally splits into an alpha-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In
particular the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe],[Fe/H]) plane
resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The
thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration and there is the
characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been
noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high
sigma_z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a
natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of sigma_z
with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the ISM is
predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good
agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are
inconsistent with a cutoff in the star-formation rate at low gas surface
densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in

conclude that the average kinematic age of the 20 pc sample of ultracool dwarfs
is older than recent kinematic estimates and more consistent with age results
calculated with population synthesis models. There is a statistically distinct
population of high tangential velocity sources whose kinematics suggest an even
older population of ultracool dwarfs belonging to either the Galactic thick
disk or halo. We isolate subsets of the entire sample, including low
surface-gravity dwarfs, unusually blue L dwarfs, and photometric outliers in
J-Ks color and investigate their kinematics. We find that the spectroscopically
distinct class of unusually blue L dwarfs has kinematics clearly consistent
with old age, implying that high surface-gravity and/or low metallicity may be
relevant to their spectral properties. The low surface-gravity dwarfs are
kinematically younger than the overall population, and the kinematics of the

overall lack of software programming discipline enforced in how spreadsheets
are developed. However, before an organization can apply proper controls and

pulses in Ge2Sb2Te5 nanopillar phase change memory devices by constructing a

and the details of the contact geometry play the dominant role in determining
the final phase composition of the device such that a non-uniform heating
scheme promotes partial amorphization/crystallization for a wide range of pulse
parameters enabling multiple resistance levels for data storage applications.
Furthermore we find that fluctuations in the snap-back voltage and set/reset
resistances in repeated switching experiments are related to the details of the
current distribution such that a uniform current injection geometry (i.e.
circular contact) favors more reproducible switching parameters. This shows
that possible geometrical defects in nanoscale phase change memory devices may
play an essential role in the performance of the smallest possible devices
through modification of the exact current distribution in the active
chalcogenide layer. We present a three-dimensional finite element model of the
electro-thermal physics to provide insights into the underlying physical
mechanisms of the switching dynamics as well as to quantitatively account for
the scaling behaviour of the switching currents in both circular and
rectangular contact geometries. The calculated temporal evolution of the heat
distribution within the pulse duration shows distinct features in rectangular
contacts providing evidence for locally hot spots at the sharp corners of the
current injection site due to current crowding effects leading to the observed
behaviour.

freedom. It is achieved via a form of interference alignment in the time
domain. A caveat of this result is that W must grow with K, a phenomenon we
refer to as {\it bandwidth scaling}. Our insight comes from examining channels
with single path links (D=1), which we refer to as line-of-sight (LOS) links.
For such channels we build a time-indexed interference graph and associate the
communication problem with finding its maximal independent set. This graph has
a stationarity property that we exploit to solve the problem efficiently via
dynamic programming. Additionally, the interference graph enables us to
demonstrate the necessity of bandwidth scaling for any scheme operating over
LOS interference channels. Bandwidth scaling is then shown to also be a
necessary ingredient for interference alignment in the K-user interference
channel.

factor using the 4p density of states given by an ab initio band structure
calculation and the latter using a multi-orbital tight-binding model. The
ground state of the model Hamiltonian is evaluated within the Hartree-Fock
approximation. Correlation effects are treated within the random phase
approximation (RPA). We obtain the RIXS intensity in a wide range of
energy-loss 2-15 eV. The spectral shape is strongly modified by the RPA
correlation, showing good agreement with the experiments. The
incident-photon-energy dependence also agrees well with the experiments. The
present mechanism that the RIXS spectra arise from band-to-band transitions to

energies exceeding $10^{18}$ eV. This is the same energy as carried by a tennis
ball moving at 100 km/h, but concentrated on a sub-atomic particle. UHECRs are
so rare (the flux of particles with $E > 10^{20}$ eV is 0.5/km$^2$/century)
that only a few such particles have been detected over the past 50 years.
Recently, the HiRes and Auger experiments have reported the discovery of a
high-energy cut-off in the UHECR spectrum, and Auger has found an apparent
clustering of the highest energy events towards nearby active galactic nuclei.
Consensus is building that the highest energy particles are accelerated within
the radio-bright lobes of these objects, but it remains unclear how this
actually happens, and whether the cut-off is due to propagation effects or
reflects an intrinsically physical limitation of the acceleration process. The
low event statistics presently allows for many different plausible models;
nevertheless observations are beginning to impose strong constraints on them.
These observations have also motivated suggestions that new physics may be
implicated. We present a review of the key theoretical and observational issues
related to the processes of propagation and acceleration of UHECRs and proposed
solutions.

monochromatically driven one-dimensional Morse oscillator by recreating
barriers, in the form of invariant tori with irrational winding ratios, at
specific locations in the phase space. The control algorithm proposed by Huang
{\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 053408 (2006)) is used to obtain an
analytic expression for the control field. We show that the control term,
approximated as an additional weaker field, is efficient in recreating the
desired tori and suppresses the classical as well as the quantum dissociation.
However, in the case when the field frequency is tuned close to a two-photon
resonance the local barriers are not effective in suppressing the dissociation.
We establish that in the on-resonant case quantum dissociation primarily occurs
via resonance-assisted tunneling and controlling the quantum dynamics requires
a local perturbation of the specific nonlinear resonance in the underlying

incomplete, the oscillation period increases with increasing orbital separation

spectral type of the central star. Our results suggest that the dependence of
V/R oscillation period on the orbital separation and binary mass ratio should

compact dwarf galaxy (BCD) Mrk 996, with an oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H)=8.0. This galaxy has the peculiarity of possessing an
extraordinarily dense nuclear star-forming region, with a central density of
~10^6 cm^{-3}. The nuclear region of Mrk 996 is characterized by several
unusual properties: a very red color J-K = 1.8, broad and narrow emission-line
components, and ionizing radiation as hard as 54.9 eV, as implied by the
presence of the OIV 25.89 micron line. The nucleus is located within an
exponential disk with colors consistent with a single stellar population of age
>1 Gyr. The infrared morphology of Mrk 996 changes with wavelength. The IRS
spectrum shows strong narrow Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission,
with narrow line widths and equivalent widths that are high for the metallicity
of Mrk 996. Gaseous nebular fine-structure lines are also seen. A CLOUDY model
requires that they originate in two distinct HII regions: a very dense HII
region of radius ~580 pc with densities declining from ~10^6 at the center to a
few hundreds cm^{-3} at the outer radius, where most of the optical lines
arise; and a HII region with a density of ~300 cm^{-3} that is hidden in the
optical but seen in the MIR. We suggest that the infrared lines arise mainly in
the optically obscured HII region while they are strongly suppressed by
collisional deexcitation in the optically visible one. The hard ionizing
radiation needed to account for the OIV 25.89 micron line is most likely due to
fast radiative shocks propagating in an interstellar medium. A hidden
population of Wolf-Rayet stars of type WNE-w or a hidden AGN as sources of hard
ionizing radiation are less likely possibilities.

possibility for users to switch from one technology to another (vertical
handover). This allows flexibility in resource assignments and, consequently,
increases the potential throughput allocated to each user. In this paper, we
design a fully distributed algorithm based on trial and error mechanisms that
exploits the benefits of vertical handover by finding fair and efficient
assignment schemes. On the one hand, mobiles gradually update the fraction of
data packets they send to each network based on the rewards they receive from
the stations. On the other hand, network stations send rewards to each mobile
that represent the impact each mobile has on the cell throughput. This reward
function is closely related to the concept of marginal cost in the pricing
literature. Both the station and the mobile algorithms are simple enough to be
implemented in current standard equipment. Based on tools from evolutionary
games, potential games and replicator dynamics, we analytically show the
convergence of the algorithm to solutions that are efficient and fair in terms
of throughput. Moreover, we show that after convergence, each user is connected
to a single network cell which avoids costly repeated vertical handovers.
Several simple heuristics based on this algorithm are proposed to achieve fast
convergence. Indeed, for implementation purposes, the number of iterations
should remain in the order of a few tens. We also compare, for different loads,
the quality of their solutions.

new approach to the question of orbital angular momentum of light based on the

for the scalar field is treated in rotating system using the general
relativistic framework. First we show the equivalence of the U(1) gauge current
for the scalar field with the Poynting vector continuity equation for paraxial

paradox in the orbital angular momentum of rotating light. An artificial
analogue of the paradoxical situation could be constructed but it is wrong
within the present formalism. It is shown that the orbital angular momentum of

to that of rigid rotation. A short review on the electromagnetism in

strongly polarizable target exposed to a laser field can deviate noticeably

approximation the profile of distribution is modified due to the action of the
field of alternating dipole moment induced at the residue by the laser field.
This effect, being quite sensitive to the dynamic polarizability of the residue
and to its geometry, depends also on the intensity and frequency of the laser
field. Numerical results, presented for sodium cluster anions, demonstrate that
dramatic changes to the profile occur for the photon energies in vicinities of
the plasmon resonances, where the effect is enhanced due to the increase in the
residue polarizability. Strong modifications of the characteristics of a

between the foreground and the observer, leading to a correction to the
observed galaxy-lensing signal. The aim of this paper is to quantify this
correction. The single most important determining factor is the foreground
redshift z: the correction is small if the foreground galaxies are at low
redshifts but can become non-negligible for sufficiently high redshifts. For
instance, we find that for the multipole l=1000, the correction is above
1%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.37, and above 5%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.67, where s is the number
count slope of the foreground sample, and b its galaxy bias. These
considerations are particularly important for geometrical measures, such as the
Jain and Taylor ratio or its generalization by Zhang et al. Assuming
(5s-2)/b=1, we find that the foreground redshift should be limited to z<0.45 in
order to avoid biasing the inferred dark energy equation of state w by more
than 5%, and that even for a low foreground redshift (< 0.45), the background
samples must be well separated from the foreground to avoid incurring a bias of
similar magnitude. Lastly, we briefly comment on the possibility of obtaining
these geometrical measures without using galaxy shapes, using instead
magnification bias itself.

(2005a,b) that the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in
low-mass X-ray binaries may be explained as a resonant oscillation of the
accretion disk with a rotating asymmetric background (gravitational or
magnetic) field imposed by the compact object. Here, we apply this general idea
to black hole binaries. It is assumed that a test particle experiences a
similar parametric resonance mechanism such as the one described in paper I and
II but now the resonance is induced by the interaction between a spiral density
wave in the accretion disk, excited close to the innermost stable circular
orbit, and vertical epicyclic oscillations. We use the Kerr spacetime geometry
to deduce the characteristic frequencies of this test particle. The response of
the test particle is maximal when the frequency ratio of the two strongest
resonances is equal to 3:2 as observed in black hole candidates. Finally,
applying our model to the microquasar GRS 1915+105, we reproduce the correct
value of several HF-QPOs. Indeed the presence of the 168/113/56/42/28 Hz
features in the power spectrum time analysis is predicted. Moreover, based only
on the two HF-QPO frequencies, our model is able to constrain the mass $M_{\rm

extreme conditions behaves as near-ideal liquid rather, than ideal gas of
quarks and gluons. The strong quenching of jets and the dramatic modification

explain the anomalous flux ratios in gravitational lenses. About 25% of lenses
in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) appear to have luminous satellites
within ~ 5 kpc/h of the main lensing galaxies, which are usually at redshift z
~ 0.2-1. In this work we use the Millennium Simulation combined with galaxy
catalogues from semi-analytical techniques to study the predicted frequency of
such satellites in simulated haloes. The fraction of haloes that host bright
satellites within the (projected) central regions is similar for red and blue
hosts and is found to increase as a function of host halo mass and redshift.
Specifically, at z = 1, about 11% of galaxy-sized haloes (with masses between
10^{12} M_sun/h and 10^{13} M_sun/h) host bright satellite galaxies within a
projected radius of 5 kpc/h. This fraction increases to about 17% (25%) if we
consider bright (all) satellites of only group-sized haloes (with masses
between 10^{13} M_sun/h and 10^{14} M_sun/h). These results are roughly
consistent with the fraction (~ 25%) of CLASS lensing galaxies observed to host
luminous satellites. At z = 0, only ~ 3% of galaxy-sized haloes host bright
satellite galaxies. The fraction rises to ~ 6%, (10%) if we consider bright
(all) satellites of only group-sized haloes at z = 0. However, most of the
satellites found in the inner regions are `orphan' galaxies where the dark

obtained combining new redshift data for 86 galaxies acquired at the TNG with
data obtained by CNOC team and other few data from the literature. We also use
new photometric data obtained at the INT telescope. We combine galaxy

analyze the cluster structure using the weighted gap analysis, the KMM method,
the Dressler-Shectman statistics and the analysis of the velocity dispersion

concepts in establishing fixed-parameter tractability results. Indeed, by
Courcelle's Theorem we know: Any property of finite structures, which is
expressible by an MSO sentence, can be decided in linear time (data complexity)
if the structures have bounded treewidth.
  In principle, Courcelle's Theorem can be applied directly to construct
concrete algorithms by transforming the MSO evaluation problem into a tree
language recognition problem. The latter can then be solved via a finite tree
automaton (FTA). However, this approach has turned out to be problematical,
since even relatively simple MSO formulae may lead to a ``state explosion'' of
the FTA.
  In this work we propose monadic datalog (i.e., datalog where all intentional
predicate symbols are unary) as an alternative method to tackle this class of
fixed-parameter tractable problems. We show that if some property of finite
structures is expressible in MSO then this property can also be expressed by
means of a monadic datalog program over the structure plus the tree
decomposition.
  Moreover, we show that the resulting fragment of datalog can be evaluated in
linear time (both w.r.t. the program size and w.r.t. the data size). This new
approach is put to work by devising new algorithms for the 3-Colorability
problem of graphs and for the PRIMALITY problem of relational schemas (i.e.,
testing if some attribute in a relational schema is part of a key). We also

Standard Model, is that it is usually defined including an ad hoc symmetry,
R-parity, whose sole purpose is to forbid rapid proton decay. This symmetry
deeply alters the phenomenology of the MSSM, and renders the experimental
search strategies quite involved. Besides, the MSSM suffers from a number of
flavor puzzles. Generically, the superparticle contributions to Flavor Changing
Neutral Currents (FCNC) are too large compared to experiment, both in the quark

suppressing these contributions, and when enforced as a symmetry principle,
achieves this in a very natural and systematic way. In this talk, it will be
shown that imposing MFV is not only able to suppress supersymmetric
contributions to FCNC, it also naturally explains the apparent stability of the
proton. As a result, R-parity can be avoided altogether, motivating the search
for supersymmetry through simpler channels, like for example single stop
resonant production, whose strength is predicted by MFV.

prefers a coordinate system of two-dimensional spatial x-y coordinates from

necessary in such cases to develop Lorentz transformations where the line of

these transformations and show that under such transformations, two orthogonal

also illustrate the usefulness of the transformation by applying it to three

using vector algebra. Such derivations assume that the axes of K and K-prime

X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei, there has been less of a focus on
these lines in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). However, recent
observations with Suzaku and XMM-Newton have revealed broad asymmetric iron
line profiles in 4 neutron star LMXBs, confirming an inner disk origin for
these lines in neutron star systems. Here, we present a search for iron lines
in 6 neutron star LMXBs. For each object we have simultaneous Chandra and RXTE
observations at 2 separate epochs, allowing for both a high resolution
spectrum, as well as broadband spectral coverage. Out of the six objects in the
survey, we only find significant iron lines in two of the objects, GX 17+2 and
GX 349+2. However, we cannot rule out that there are weak, broad lines present
in the other sources. The equivalent width of the line in GX 17+2 is consistent
between the 2 epochs, while in GX 349+2 the line equivalent width increases by
a factor of ~3 between epochs as the source flux decreases by a factor of 1.3.
This suggests that the disk is highly ionized, and the line is dominated by
recombination emission. We find that there appears to be no specific locations
in the long-term hardness-intensity diagrams where iron emission lines are
formed, though more sources and further observations are required.

us to use in-plane data even at the innermost Galactic longitudes, a region
where the source confusion is a dominant effect that makes it impossible to use
other NIR databases such as 2MASS or TCS-CAIN. We show that results previously

the present paper we analyze the CaT strength (WCaT), and kinematical products
derived in that study, namely stellar and ionized gas velocity dispersions. Our
main results may be summarized as follows: (1) Seyfert 2s show no sign of
dilution in WCaT with respect to the values spanned by normal galaxies, even
when optical absorption lines such as the CaII K band at 3933 A are much weaker
than in old, bulge-like stellar populations. (2) The location of Seyfert 2s in
the WCaT-WCaK plane is consistent with evolutionary synthesis models. The
implication is that the source responsible for the dilution of optical lines in
these AGN is a young stellar population, rather than an AGN featureless
continuum, confirming the conclusion of the pioneer study of Terlevich, Diaz &
Terlevich. (3) In Seyfert 1s, both W[SIII] and WCaT tend to be diluted due to
the presence of a non-stellar component, in agreement with the unification
paradigm. (4) A comparison of stellar and gas velocity dispersions confirms the
existence of a correlation between the typical velocities of stars and clouds
of the Narrow Line Region. The strength and scatter around this correlation are
similar to those previously obtained from the [OIII]5007 line width.

Variates (CV). We show that, once an initial setup cost for extracting

multi-contact interface formed between a rough elastomer and a smooth glass
surface. The in-plane elastomer deformation is monitored during the incipient
sliding regime, i.e. the transition between static and sliding contact. As the
shear load is increased, an annular slip region, in coexistence with a central
stick region, is found to progressively invade the contact. From the
interfacial displacement field, the tangential stress field can be further
computed using a numerical inversion procedure. These local mechanical
measurements are found to be correctly captured by Cattaneo and Mindlin (CM)'s
model. However, close comparison reveals significant discrepancies in both the
displacements and stress fields that reflect the oversimplifying hypothesis
underlying CM's scenario. In particular, our optical measurements allow us to
exhibit an elasto-plastic like friction constitutive equation that differs from
the rigid-plastic behavior assumed in CM's model. This local constitutive law,
which involves a roughness-related length scale, is consistent with the model
of Bureau \textit{et al.} [Proc. R. Soc. London A \textbf{459}, 2787 (2003)]
derived for homogeneously loaded macroscopic multi-contact interfaces, thus
extending its validity to mesoscopic scales.measurements allow for the first
quantitative test of Cattaneo and Mindlin (CM) classical model of the incipient
sliding of a smooth interface. Small deviations are observed and interpreted as
a result of the finite compliance of the rough interface, a behavior which
contrasts with Amontons' law of friction assumed to be valid locally in CM's
model. We illustrate how these measurements actually provide a method for
probing the rheology of the rough interface, which we find to be of the
elasto-plastic type.

investigated on the basis of the two-dimensional 16-band d-p model which
includes the Coulomb interaction on a Fe site: the intra- and inter-orbital
direct terms U and U', the Hund's coupling J and the pair-transfer J'. Using
the random phase approximation (RPA), we obtain the magnetic phase diagram
including the stripe and the incommensurate order on the U'-J plane. We also
solve the superconducting gap equation within the RPA and find that, for large
J, the most favorable pairing symmetry is extended s-wave whose order parameter
changes its sign between the hole pockets and the electron pockets, while it is
dxy-wave for small J.

evaluate new spin foam vertex amplitudes proposed by Engle, Pereira & Rovelli
and Freidel & Krasnov, with or without (factored) boundary states. A concrete
pragmatic proposal is made for comparing the different models using uniform
methodologies, applicable to the behavior of large spin asymptotics and of
expectation values of specific semiclassical observables. The asymptotics of
the new models exhibit non-oscillatory, power-law decay similar to that of the
Barrett-Crane model, though with different exponents. Also, an analysis of the
semiclassical wave packet propagation problem indicates that the Magliaro,
Rovelli and Perini's conjecture of good semiclassical behavior of the new
models does not hold for generic factored states, which neglect spin-spin
correlations.

for two-dimensional (2D) systems with the Fermi level near Van Hove (VH)
singularities of the electron spectrum. It is shown that the spectrum of spin
excitations (paramagnons) is positively defined when the interaction between
electrons and paramagnons, determined by the Hubbard on-site repulsion U, is
sufficiently large. Due to incommensurate spin fluctuations near the
ferromagnetic quantum phase transition, the critical interaction Uc remains
finite at VH filling and exceeds considerably its value obtained from the
Stoner criterion. A comparison with the functional renormalization group
results and mean-field approximation which yields a phase separation is also
performed.

using suitable generalizations of the Lifshitz theory. We find that the strong
anisotropy of the BSCCO permittivity gives rise to a difference in the Casimir
force between the two orientations of the optical axis, which depends on
distance and is of order 10-20% at the experimentally accessible separations 10

bosonic and fermionic effective potential at finite temperature and volume (at
one loop). The calculations at finite volume correspond to $S^1\times R^d$
topology. These calculations appear in the calculation of the Casimir energy
and of the effective potential of extra dimensional theories. In the case of
finite volume corrections we impose twisted boundary conditions and obtain
semi-analytic results. We mainly focus in the details and validity of the
results. The zeta function regularization method is used to regularize the
infinite summations. Also the dimensional regularization method is used in
order to renormalize the UV singularities of the integrations over momentum
space. The approximations and expansions are carried out within the
perturbative limits. After the end of each section we briefly present
applications associated to the calculations. Particularly the calculation of
the effective potential at finite temperature for the Standard Model fields,
the effective potential for warped and large extra dimensions and the
topological mass creation. In the end we discuss on the convergence and
validity of one of the obtained semi-analytic results.
