comparable amounts of electrons and positrons. The e+e- gyrating in the
galactic magnetic field then produce secondary synchrotron radiation which thus
provides an indirect mean to constrain the DM signal itself. To this purpose,
we calculate the radio emission from the galactic halo as well as from its
expected substructures and we then compare it with the measured diffuse radio
background. We employ a multi-frequency approach using data in the relevant
frequency range 100 MHz-100 GHz, as well as the WMAP Haze data at 23 GHz. The
derived constraints are of the order <sigma_A*v>=10^{-24} cm3 s^{-1} for a DM
mass m_chi=100 GeV sensibly depending however on the astrophysical
uncertainties, in particular on the assumption on the galactic magnetic field
model. The signal from single bright clumps is instead largely attenuated by
diffusion effects and offers only poor detection perspectives.

The planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peak
magnification A_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,
resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. The angular extent
of the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller than
the angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is also
smoothed out by the finite source size. Thus the deviation from a single-lens
fit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). Nevertheless, we demonstrate
that the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertained
from the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairly
precise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the large
significance (\Delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. The planet/star projected
separation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to two
indistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.
Upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be M < 0.75 M_Sun
(assuming it is a main-sequence star). A Bayesian analysis that includes all
available observational constraints indicates a primary in the Galactic bulge
with a mass of ~0.2-0.5 M_Sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 M_Jupiter.
The separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1AU (~5.3-9.7AU) and
~103K (~34K) for the close (wide) solution. If the primary is a main-sequence
star, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so a
measurement of its mass and distance.

galaxies in a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological simulation
that resolves galaxies down to 7e9 M[Sun]. Most friends-of-friends halos in the
simulation have a distinct central galaxy, typically two to five times more
massive than the most massive satellite. As expected, satellites have
systematically higher assembly redshifts than central galaxies of the same
baryonic mass, and satellites in more massive halos form earlier. However,
contrary to the simplest expectations, satellite galaxies continue to accrete
gas and convert it to stars; the gas accretion declines steadily over a period
of 0.5-1 Gyr after the satellite halo merges with a larger parent halo.
Satellites in a cluster mass halo eventually begin to lose baryonic mass. Since
z=1, 27% of central galaxies (above 3e10 M[Sun]) and 22% of present-day
satellite galaxies have merged with a smaller system above a 1:4 mass ratio;
about half of the satellite mergers occurred after the galaxy became a
satellite and half before. In effect, satellite galaxies can remain ""central""
objects of halo substructures, with continuing accretion and mergers, making
the transition in assembly histories and physical properties a gradual one.
Implementing such a gradual transformation in semi-analytic models would
improve their agreement with the observed colour distributions of satellite
galaxies in groups and with the observed colour dependence of galaxy
clustering.

there are no regions of the parameter space which may satisfy all constraints.
However, for the dilaton scenario, there are small regions of the parameter
space where all constraints may be satisfied and for which the observed dark
matter density may be generated. We also survey the possible signatures which
may be observable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Finally, we compare
collider signatures of OPM to those from a model with non-universal soft terms,

surface-enhanced Raman scattering is presented. Interaction effects between a
general molecular system and a spatially anisotropic metal particle supporting
plasmon excitations in the presence of an external radiation field are
systematically included through many-body perturbation theory. Reduction of the
exact effects of molecular-electronic correlation to the level of Hartree-Fock
mean-field theory is made for practical initial implementation, while
description of collective oscillations of conduction electrons in the metal is
reduced to that of a classical plasma density; extension of the former to a
Kohn-Sham density-functional or second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation
theory is discussed; further specialization of the latter to the random-phase
approximation allows for several salient features of the formalism to be
highlighted without need for numerical computation. Scattering and
linear-response properties of the coupled system subjected to an external
perturbing electric field in the electric-dipole interaction approximation are
investigated. Both damping and finite-lifetime effects of molecular-electronic
excitations as well as the characteristic fourth-power enhancement of the
molecular Raman scattering intensity are elucidated from first principles. It
is demonstrated that the presented theory reduces to previous models of
surface-enhanced Raman scattering and leads naturally to a semiclassical
picture of the response of a quantum-mechanical molecular system interacting
with a spatially anisotropic classical metal particle with electronic
polarization approximated by a discretized collection of electric dipoles.

basis of elastic waves. Elastic waves originating from atomic jumps in a liquid
propagate local expansion due to the anharmonicity of interatomic potential.
This creates dynamic compressive stress, which increases the activation barrier
for other events in a liquid. The non-trivial point is that the range of
propagation of high-frequency elastic waves, $d_{\rm el}$, increases with
liquid relaxation time $\tau$. A self-consistent calculation shows that this
increase gives the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) law. In the proposed theory, we
discuss the origin of two dynamic crossovers in a liquid: 1) the crossover from
exponential to non-exponential and from Arrhenius to VFT relaxation at high
temperature and 2) the crossover from the VFT to a more Arrhenius-like
relaxation at low temperature. The corresponding values of $\tau$ at the two
crossovers are in quantitative parameter-free agreement with experiments. The
origin of the second crossover allows us to reconcile the ongoing controversy
surrounding the possible divergence of $\tau$. The crossover to Arrhenius
relaxation universally takes place when $d_{\rm el}$ reaches system size, thus
avoiding divergence and associated theoretical complications such as
identifying the nature of the phase transition and the second phase itself.
Finally, we discuss the effect of volume on $\tau$ and the origin of liquid
fragility.

is one that finds a solution containing or near a given vertex without looking
at the whole graph. We present a local clustering algorithm. Our algorithm
finds a good cluster--a subset of vertices whose internal connections are
significantly richer than its external connections--near a given vertex. The
running time of our algorithm, when it finds a non-empty local cluster, is
nearly linear in the size of the cluster it outputs.
  Our clustering algorithm could be a useful primitive for handling massive
graphs, such as social networks and web-graphs. As an application of this
clustering algorithm, we present a partitioning algorithm that finds an
approximate sparsest cut with nearly optimal balance. Our algorithm takes time
nearly linear in the number edges of the graph.
  Using the partitioning algorithm of this paper, we have designed a
nearly-linear time algorithm for constructing spectral sparsifiers of graphs,
which we in turn use in a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear
systems in symmetric, diagonally-dominant matrices. The linear system solver
also leads to a nearly linear-time algorithm for approximating the
second-smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the Laplacian
matrix of a graph. These other results are presented in two companion papers.

challenges to understanding dust formation and evolution. The mid-infrared
spectrum of IRAS 17495$-$2534, a highly obscured oxygen-rich asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star, is the only source observed to date which exhibits a clear
crystalline silicate absorption feature. This provides an unprecedented
opportunity to test competing hypotheses for dust formation. Observed spectral
features suggest that both amorphous and crystalline dust is dominated by
forsterite (Mg\_2 SiO\_4) rather than enstatite (MgSiO\_3) or other silicate
compositions. We confirm that high mass-loss rates should produce more
crystalline material, and show why this should be dominated by forsterite. The
presence of Mg\_2 SiO\_4 glass suggests that another factor (possibly C/O) is
critical in determining astromineralogy. Correlation between crystallinity,
mass-loss rate and initial stellar mass suggests that only the most massive AGB
stars contribute significant quantities of crystalline material to the
interstellar medium, resolving the conundrum of its low crystallinity.

moment at each impurity site, as a function of the distance between the
impurities and the temperature. At zero temperature, in the region of
parameters corresponding to the Kondo regime of the impurities, we observe an
interesting competition between the AF gap and the Kondo physics of the two
impurities. When the impurities are close enough, the AF splitting governs the
physics of the system and the local moments of the impurities are frozen, in a
state with very strong ferromagnetic correlation between the impurities and
roughly independent of the distance. On the contrary, when the impurities are
sufficiently far apart and the AF gap is not too large, the scenario of the
Kondo physics take place: non-magnetic ground state and the possibility of
spin-flip excitation emerges and the ferromagnetic
$<\mathbf{S}_{1}\mathbf{S}_{2}>$ decreases as the distance increases, but the
complete decoupling of the impurities never occurs. In adition, the presence of

the entanglement dynamics, and usually leads to the loss of entanglement within
a finite time. Since entanglement is a key feature in the application of such
systems to quantum information processing, it is highly desirable to find a way
to prolonging its lifetime. We present a simple model of an interacting
two-qubit system in the presence of a thermal Markovian environment. The qubits
are modeled as interacting spin-$\half$ particles in a magnetic field and the
environment is limited to inducing single spin-flip events. A simple scheme
allows us to calculate the relaxation rates for all processes. We show that the
relaxation dynamics of the most entangled state exhibit critical slowing down
as a function of the magnetic field, where the relaxation rate changes from
exponentially small values to finite values in the zero-temperature limit. We
study the effect of temperature and magnetic field on all the other relaxation
rates and find that they exhibit unusual properties, such as non-monotonic
dependence on temperature and a discontinuity as a function of magnetic field.
In addition, a simple scheme to include non-Markovian effects is presented and
applied to the two-qubit model. We find that the relaxation rates exhibit a
sharp, cusp-like resonant structure as a function of the environment
memory-time, and that for long memory-times all the different relaxation rates
merge into a single one.

mass ratio of 0.1, a secondary black hole mass of 100 million solar masses, and
assuming inclination and orbital phase angles of 45 degrees. In this model the
origin of the blueshifted narrow emission lines is naturally explained in the
context of an accretion flow within the inner rim of the circumbinary disk. We
attribute the blueshifted broad emission lines to gas associated with a disk
around the accreting secondary black hole. We show that, within the
uncertainties, this binary system can be long lived and thus, is not observed
in a special moment in time. The orbital motion of the binary can potentially
be observed with the VLBA if at least the secondary black hole is a radio
emitter. In addition, for the parameters quoted above, the orbital motion will
result in a ~100 km/s velocity shift of the emission lines on a time scale of
about a year, providing a direct observational test for the binary hypothesis.

gluinos are pair-produced and decay to the LSP through a single-step cascade,
and show how sensitivity to different gluino masses is altered by the presence
of the decay chain. The analysis is closely based upon the current searches
done at the Tevatron and our proposal requires only small modifications to the
existing techniques. We find that within the MSSM, the gluino can be as light
as 125 GeV. The same techniques are applicable to jets and missing energy

that may reach several million years. They may therefore be extended over large
sizes (~1 pc, possibly more), and different complementary tracers are needed to
describe their global properties. In the present work, we combined 21-cm HI and
CO rotational line data obtained on an oxygen-rich semi-regular variable, RX
Lep, to describe the global properties of its circumstellar environment. With
the SEST, we detected the CO(2-1) rotational line from RX Lep. The line profile
is parabolic and implies an expansion velocity of ~4.2 km/s and a mass-loss
rate ~1.7 10^-7 Msun/yr (d = 137 pc). The HI line at 21 cm was detected with
the Nancay Radiotelescope on the star position and at several offset positions.
The linear shell size is relatively small, ~0.1 pc, but we detect a trail
extending southward to ~0.5 pc. The line profiles are approximately Gaussian
with an FWHM ~3.8 km/s and interpreted with a model developed for the detached
shell around the carbon-rich AGB star Y CVn. Our HI spectra are well-reproduced
by assuming a constant outflow (Mloss = 1.65 10^-7 Msun/yr) of ~4 10^4 years
duration, which has been slowed down by the external medium. The spatial offset
of the HI source is consistent with the northward direction of the proper
motion, lending support to the presence of a trail resulting from the motion of
the source through the ISM, as already suggested for Mira, RS Cnc, and other
sources detected in HI. The source was also observed in SiO (3 mm) and OH (18
cm), but not detected. The properties of the external parts of circumstellar
shells around AGB stars should be dominated by the interaction between stellar
outflows and external matter for oxygen-rich, as well as for carbon-rich,
sources, and the 21-cm HI line provides a very useful tracer of these regions.

dyadic lattices of the dyadic $H^1$-norm of a function gives an equivalent
$H^1$-norm. The proof we present works for both one-parameter and
multi-parameter Hardy spaces.
  The results of such type are known. The first result (for one-parameter Hardy
spces) belongs to Burgess Davis (1980). Also, by duality, such results are
equivalent to the ""BMO from dyadic BMO"" statements proved by
Garnett-Jones(1982} for one parameter case, and by Pipher-Ward (2008) for
two-parameter case.
  While the paper generalizes these results to the multi-parameter setting,
this is not its main goal. The purpose of the paper is to present an approach
leading to a simple proof, which works in both one-parameter and
multi-parameter cases.
  The main idea of treating square function as a Calderon--Zygmind operator is
a commonplace in harmonic analysis; the main observation, on which the paper is
based, is that one can treat the random dyadic square function this way. After
that, all is proved by using the standard and well-known results about
Calderon--Zygmind operators in the Hilbert-space-valued setting.
  As an added bonus, we get a simple proof of the (equivalent by duality)
inclusion $\text{BMO}\subset \text{BMO}_d$, $H^1_d \subset H^1$ in the
multi-parameter case. Note, that unlike the one-parameter case, the inclusions
in the general situation are far from trivial.

typically centered on absorptive components of the spectral lines. They were
typically 0.3% to 2% with some signatures being variable in time. Post-AGB and
RV-Tau type evolved stars showed very strong absorptive polarimetric effects

observations were inconsistent with the traditional scattering models and

elements and the neutrino oscillation probability formula to second order
(third order in \nu_e related channels) in \epsilon. The formula allows us to
estimate size of the contribution of any particular NSI element
\epsilon_{\alpha beta} to the oscillation probability in arbitrary channels,

that while \theta_{13}, \delta, and the NSI elements in \nu_e sector can in
principle be determined, complete measurement of the NSI parameters in the

discussion for parameter determination and the analysis based on the matter
perturbation theory indicate that the parameter degeneracy prevails with the
NSI parameters. In addition, a new solar-atmospheric variable exchange
degeneracy is found. Some general properties of neutrino oscillation with and
without NSI are also illuminated.

radio sources, such as spectral-index and rotation-measure mapping, involve the
comparison of images at two or more frequencies. In the case of radio
interferometric data, this can be done by comparing the CLEAN maps obtained at
the different frequencies. However, intrinsic differences in images due to the
frequency dependence of the radio emission can be distorted by additional
differences that arise due to source variability (if the data to be compared is
obtained at different times), image misalignment, and the frequency dependence
of the sensitivity to weak emission and the angular resolution provided by the
observations (the resolution of an interferometer depends on the lengths of its
baselines in units of the observing wavelength). These effects must be
corrected for as best as possible before multi-frequency data comparison
techniques can be applied. We consider the origins for the afore-mentioned

magnetic 'face' of the minerals from the inorganic world, recognized to have
played a pivotal role in initiating Life, may throw light on some of these

have enabled the accretion and therefore an ordered confinement of
super-paramagnetic colloids within a structured phase. A moderate H-field can
help magnetic nano-particles to not only overcome thermal fluctuations but also
harness them. Such controlled dynamics brings in the possibility of accessing
quantum effects, which together with frustrations in magnetic ordering and
hysteresis (a natural mechanism for a primitive memory) could throw light on
the birth of biological information which, as Abel argues, requires a
combination of order and complexity. This scenario gains strength from
observations of scale-free framboidal forms of the greigite mineral, with a
magnetic basis of assembly. And greigite's metabolic potential plays a key role
in the mound scenario of Russell and coworkers-an expansion of which is
suggested for including magnetism.

of the exact equation of motion for a classical charged particle under the
action of its electromagnetic (EM) self-field - the so-called
radiation-reaction equation of motion (RR equation). In the past, several
attempts have been made assuming that the particle electric charge is localized
point-wise (point-charge). These involve the search of possible so-called
""regularization"" approaches able to deal with the intrinsic divergences
characterizing point-particle descriptions in classical electrodynamics. In
this paper we intend to propose a new solution to this problem based on the
adoption of a variational approach and the treatment of finite-size
spherical-shell charges. The approach is based on three key elements: 1) the
adoption of the relativistic synchronous Hamilton variational principle
recently pointed out (Tessarotto et al, 2006); 2) the variational treatment of
the EM self-field, for finite-size charges, taking into account the exact
particle dynamics; 3) the adoption of the axioms of classical mechanics and
electrodynamics. The new RR equation proposed in this paper, departing
significantly from previous approaches, exhibits several interesting
properties. In particular: a) unlike the LAD (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac) equation,
it recovers a second-order ordinary differential equation which is fully
consistent with the law of inertia, Newton principle of determinacy and
Einstein causality principle and b) unlike the LL (Landau-Lifschitz) equation,
it holds also in the case of sudden forces. In addition, it is found that the
new equation recovers the customary LAD equation in a suitable asymptotic
approximation.

been accreted from a donor star. However, sometimes flashes are seen from
transient binary systems when they are thought to be in their quiescent phase,
during which no accretion, or relatively little, is expected to occur. We
investigate the accretion luminosity during several such flashes, including the
first-ever and brightest detected flash from Cen X-4 in 1969. We infer from
observations and theory that immediately prior to these flashes the accretion
rate must have been between about 0.001 and 0.01 times the equivalent of the
Eddington limit, which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude less than the peak
accretion rates seen in these transients during an X-ray outburst and 3-4
orders of magnitude more than the lowest measured values in quiescence.
Furthermore, three such flashes, including the one from Cen X-4, occurred
within 2 to 7 days followed by an X-ray outburst. A long-term episode of
enhanced, but low-level, accretion is predicted near the end of the quiescent
phase by the disk-instability model, and may thus have provided the right
conditions for these flashes to occur. We discuss the possibility of whether
these flashes acted as triggers of the outbursts, signifying a dramatic
increase in the accretion rate. Although it is difficult to rule out, we find
it unlikely that the irradiance by these flashes is sufficient to change the
state of the accretion disk in such a dramatic way.

investigate how well a model based on a low-scale QCD effective coupling can

scattering cross sections. We exemplify our treatment by evaluating the
magnetic-field-dependent scattering characteristics of the He -- CaH ($X
^2\Sigma^+$), He -- O$_2$ ($X ^3\Sigma^-$) and He -- OH ($X ^2\Pi_{\Omega}$)

for different orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the relative
velocity vector, the model also offers predictions about the
frontal-versus-lateral steric asymmetry of the collisions. The steric asymmetry
is found to be almost negligible for the He -- OH system, weak for the He --
CaH collisions, and strong for the He -- O$_2$. While odd $\Delta M$
transitions dominate the He -- OH $(J=3/2,f \to J', e/f)$ integral cross
sections in a magnetic field parallel to the relative velocity vector, even
$\Delta M$ transitions prevail in the case of the He -- CaH ($X ^2\Sigma^+$)

magnetic field opens inelastic channels that are closed in the absence of the

  experiments","5 pages, 5 figures, preprint",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stability problem of MHD Taylor-Couette flows with toroidal magnetic
fields is considered in dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number. Only the
most uniform (but not current-free) field with B\_in = B\_out has been
considered. For high enough Hartmann numbers the toroidal field is always
unstable. Rigid rotation, however, stabilizes the magnetic (kink-)instability.
  The axial current which drives the instability is reduced by the
electromotive force induced by the instability itself. Numerical simulations
are presented to probe this effect as a possibility to measure the turbulent
conductivity in a laboratory. It is shown numerically that in a sodium
experiment (without rotation) an eddy diffusivity 4 times the molecular
diffusivity appears resulting in a potential difference of ~34 mV/m. If the
cylinders are rotating then also the eddy viscosity can be measured. Nonlinear
simulations of the instability lead to a turbulent magnetic Prandtl number of
2.1 for a molecular magnetic Prandtl number of 0.01. The trend goes to higher
values for smaller Pm.

approaches play a key role on the way towards a deeper understanding of

Hamiltonians represent an important new direction in the field. Among these
renormalization schemes the projector-based renormalization method (PRM)
reviewed here might be the approach with the widest range of possible
applications: As demonstrated in this review, continuous unitary
transformations, perturbation theory, non-perturbative phenomena, and
quantum-phase transitions can be understood within the same theoretical
framework. This review starts from the definition of an effective Hamiltonian
by means of projection operators that allows the evaluation within perturbation
theory as well as the formulation of a renormalization scheme. The developed
approach is then applied to three different many-particle systems: At first, we
study the electron-phonon problem to discuss several modifications of the
method and to demonstrate how phase transitions can be described within the
PRM. Secondly, to show that non-perturbative phenomena are accessible by the
PRM, the periodic Anderson model is investigated to describe heavy-fermion
behavior. Finally, we discuss the quantum-phase transition in the
one-dimensional Holstein model of spinless fermions where both metallic and
insulating phase are described within the same theoretical framework.

objects in surveys with the particular goal of building very pure samples. It
works by modifying the output probabilities from a classifier so as to
accommodate our expectation (priors) concerning the relative frequencies of
different classes of objects. We demonstrate our method using the Discrete
Source Classifier, a supervised classifier currently based on Support Vector
Machines, which we are developing in preparation for the Gaia data analysis.
DSC classifies objects using their very low resolution optical spectra. We look
in detail at the problem of quasar classification, because identification of a
pure quasar sample is necessary to define the Gaia astrometric reference frame.
By varying a posterior probability threshold in DSC we can trade off sample
completeness and contamination. We show, using our simulated data, that it is
possible to achieve a pure sample of quasars (upper limit on contamination of 1
in 40,000) with a completeness of 65% at magnitudes of G=18.5, and 50% at
G=20.0, even when quasars have a frequency of only 1 in every 2000 objects. The
star sample completeness is simultaneously 99% with a contamination of 0.7%.
Including parallax and proper motion in the classifier barely changes the
results. We further show that not accounting for class priors in the target
population leads to serious misclassifications and poor predictions for sample
completeness and contamination. (Truncated)

$\gamma(z)$ on low redshifts up to $z\sim 0.3$, $\gamma(z)$ is also
quasi-linear in this interval. At redshift $z=0.5$, the dispersion is still

possessing a quality. The new incoming node connects to the preexisting node
with best quality, that is, with record value for the quality. The emergent
structure is that of a growing network, where groups are formed around record
nodes (nodes endowed with the best intrinsic qualities). Special emphasis is
put on the statistics of leaders (nodes whose degrees are the largest). The
asymptotic probability for a node to be a leader is equal to the Golomb-Dickman

This outcome solves the problem of the determination of the record breaking
rate for the sequence of correlated inter-record intervals. The process
exhibits temporal self-similarity in the late-time regime. Connections with the
statistics of the cycles of random permutations, the statistical properties of
randomly broken intervals, and the Kesten variable are given.

polycrystalline superconducting oxypnictides differ by three orders of
magnitude, we have conducted combined magneto-optical and microstructural
examinations of representative randomly oriented polycrystalline Nd and Sm
single-layer oxypnictides. Magneto optical images show that the highest Jc
values are observed within single grains oriented with their c axes
perpendicular to the observation plane, implying that the intragranular current
is anisotropic. The much lower intergranular Jc is at least partially due to
many extrinsic factors, because cracks and a ubiquitous wetting As-Fe phase are
found at many grain boundaries. However, some grain boundaries are structurally
clean under high resolution transmission electron microscopy examination.
Because the whole-sample global Jc(5K) values of the two samples examined are
1000-4000 A/cm2, some 10-40 times that found in random, polycrystalline
YBa2Cu3O7-x, it appears that the dominant obstruction to intergranular current
flow of many present samples is extrinsic, though some intrinsic limitation of
current flow across grain boundaries cannot yet be ruled out.

Lie groupoids. This result is obtained by replacing the category of smooth
vector bundles over the base manifold of a Lie groupoid with a larger category,
the category of smooth Euclidean fields, and by considering smooth actions of
Lie groupoids on smooth Euclidean fields. The notion of smooth Euclidean field
that is introduced here is the smooth, finite dimensional analogue of the
familiar notion of continuous Hilbert field. In the second part of the thesis,
ordinary smooth representations of Lie groupoids on smooth vector bundles are
systematically studied from the point of view of Tannaka duality, and various
results are obtained in this direction.

composed of arrays of nanostructured superconducting devices. The logic states
are defined by the position of two trapped flux quanta (vortices) in a 2x2
blind-hole-matrix etched on a mesoscopic superconducting square. Such small
computational unit-cells are well within reach of current fabrication
technology. In an array of unit-cells, the vortex configuration of one cell
influences the penetrating flux lines in the neighboring cell through the
screening currents. Alternatively, in conjoined cells, the information transfer
can be strengthened by the interactions between the supercurrents in adjacent
cells. Here we present the functioning logic gates based on this fluxonic
cellular automata (FCA), where the logic operations are verified through
theoretical simulations performed in the framework of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. The input signals are defined by current loops placed
on top of the two diagonal blind holes of the input cell. For given
current-polarization, external flux lines are attracted or repelled by the
loops, forming the '0' or '1' configuration. The read-out technology may be
chosen from a large variety of modern vortex imaging methods, transport and
LDOS measurements.

AGNs have shown that thick gas tori and starbursts with ages between 10 and
150Myr are frequently found. By applying these observations to a previously
established analytical model of clumpy accretion disks, we suggest an
evolutionary sequence for starburst and AGN phases. Whereas the observed
properties of the gas tell us about the current state of the torus, the
starburst characteristics provide information on the history of the torus. In
the suggested evolution, a torus passes through 3 different phases
predetermined by an external mass accretion rate. Started by an initial, short,
and massive gas infall, a turbulent and stellar wind-driven Q~1 disk is formed
in which the starburst proceeds. Once the supernovae explode the intercloud
medium is removed, leaving a massive, geometrically thick, collisional disk
with a decreasing, but still high-mass accretion rate. When the mass accretion
rate has significantly decreased, the collisional torus becomes thin and
transparent as the circumnuclear disk in the Galactic center of the Milky Way.
Variations on this scenario are possible either when there is a second short
and massive gas infall, in which case the torus may switch back into the
starburst mode, or when there is no initial short massive gas infall. All
observed tori up to now have been collisional and thick. The observations show
that this phase can last more than 100Myr. During this phase the decrease in
the mass accretion rate within the torus is slow (a factor of 4 within 150Myr).
The collisional tori also form stars, but with an efficiency of about 10% when
compared to a turbulent disk.

rise to an almost scale invariant spectrum of metric perturbations since in
this scenario the energy is proportional to the area of the boundary rather
than the volume. Here we calculate the non-Gaussianity of the spectrum of
cosmological fluctuations in holographic phase, which can imprint on the
radiation dominated universe by an abrupt transition. We find that if the
matter is phantom-like, the non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{equil}$ can reach ${\cal
O}(1)$ or even be larger than ${\cal O}(1)$. Especially in the limit $\omega\to
-5/3$, the non-Gaussianity is very large and negative. Furthermore, since the
energy is proportional to the area, the thermal holographic non-Gaussianity
depends linearly on $k$ if we neglect the variation in $T$ during the
transition (fixed temperature).
