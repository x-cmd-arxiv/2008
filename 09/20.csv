  Original abstract: We exhibit a renormalization group flow for a
four-dimensional gauge theory along which the conformal central charge 'a'
increases. The flow connects the maximally superconformal point of an N=2 gauge
theory with gauge group SU(N+1) and N_f=2N flavors in the ultraviolet, to a
strongly-coupled superconformal point of the SU(N) gauge theory with N_f=2N
massless flavors in the infrared. Our example does not contradict the proof of
the a-theorem via a-maximization, due to the presence of accidental symmetries
in the infrared limit. Nor does it contradict the holographic a-theorem,
because these gauge theories do not possess weakly-curved holographic duals.

060607, 071031, and 080310. Four of these spectra were taken in rapid-response
mode, within 30 minutes of the Swift GRB detection. We identify several
distinct categories of high-ion absorption at velocities close to z_GRB: (i)
Strong high-ion components at z_GRB itself are always seen in OVI, CIV, and
SiIV, and usually (in 6 of 7 cases) in NV. We discuss circumburst and
interstellar models for the origin of this absorption. Using the non-detection
of SIV* toward GRB 050730 together with a UV photo-excitation model, we place a
lower limit of 400 pc on the distance of the SIV-bearing gas from the GRB. (ii)
Complex, multi-component CIV and SiIV profiles extending over 100-400 km/s
around z_GRB are observed in each spectrum; these velocity fields are similar
to those measured in damped Lyman-alpha systems at similar redshifts,
suggesting a galactic origin. (iii) Asymmetric, blueshifted, absorption-line
wings covering 65-140 km/s are seen in the CIV, SiIV, and OVI profiles in 4 of
the 7 spectra. The wing kinematics together with the observation that two wings
show ""Galactic"" CIV/SiIV ratios suggest these features trace outflowing ISM gas
in the GRB host galaxies. (iv) High-velocity (HV; 500-5000 km/s) components are
detected in 6 of the 7 spectra. The HV components show diverse properties. In
the cases of GRBs 071031 and 080310, both the ionization level (very high
CIV/SiIV ratios and absence of neutral-phase absorption) and the kinematics of
the HV components can be explained by Wolf-Rayet winds from the GRB
progenitors.

further entanglement sudden death/birth events culminating in the formation of

together with statistics of the entanglement genesis time in the weak

the physics is presented, aided by the derivation of a simple concurrence
equation for Bell basis X-states. The probability of entanglement border
crossing and mean first passage times are calculated for the case of
measurement dynamics alone. We find that states with almost the same

investigation of lopsidedness in a sample of ~25,000 nearby galaxies (z <
0.06). We use the m=1 azimuthal Fourier mode between the 50% and 90% light
radii as our measure of lopsidedness. The SDSS spectra are used to measure the
properties of the stars, gas, and black hole in the central-most few-kpc-scale
region. We show that there is a strong link between lopsidedness in the outer
parts of the galactic disk and the youth of the stellar population in the
central region. This link is independent of the other structural properties of
the galaxy. These results provide a robust statistical characterization of the
connections between accretion/interactions/mergers and the resulting star
formation. We also show that residuals in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation
correlate with lopsidedness (at fixed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies are
more lopsided). This suggests that the events causing lopsidedness and enhanced
star formation deliver lower metallicity gas into the galaxy's central region.
Finally, we find that there is a trend for the more powerful active galactic
nuclei to be hosted by more lopsided galaxies (at fixed galaxy mass, density,
or concentration). However if we compare samples matched to have both the same
structures and central stellar populations, we then find no difference in
lopsidedness between active and non-active galaxies. This leads to the
following picture. The presence of cold gas in the central region of a galaxy
(irrespective of its origin) is essential for both star-formation and black
hole growth. The delivery of cold gas is aided by the processes that produce
lopsidedness. Other processes on scales smaller than we can probe with our data
are required to transport the gas to the black hole.

standard LCDM model. Extensions of the spherical top-hat collapse model predict
that the virial overdensity and linear threshold density for collapse should be
modified in EDE model, yielding significant modifications in the expected halo
mass function. Here we present numerical simulations that directly test these
expectations. Interestingly, we find that the Sheth & Tormen formalism for
estimating the abundance of dark matter halos continues to work very well in
its standard form for the Early Dark Energy cosmologies, contrary to analytic
predictions. The residuals are even slightly smaller than for LCDM. We also
study the virial relationship between mass and dark matter velocity dispersion
in different dark energy cosmologies, finding excellent agreement with the
normalization for Lambda as calibrated by Evrard et al.(2008). The earlier
growth of structure in EDE models relative to LCDM produces large differences
in the mass functions at high redshift. This could be measured directly by
counting groups as a function of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion,
skirting the ambiguous problem of assigning a mass to the halo. Using dark
matter substructures as a proxy for member galaxies, we demonstrate that even
with 3-5 members sufficiently accurate measurements of the halo velocity
dispersion function are possible. Finally, we determine the concentration-mass
relationship for our EDE cosmologies. Consistent with the earlier formation
time, the EDE halos show higher concentrations at a given halo mass. We find
that the magnitude of the difference in concentration is well described by the
prescription of Eke et al.(2001) for estimating halo concentrations.

consequences for Pulsar Timing Arrays observations. Depending on the specific
massive black hole population model, we estimate that on average at least one
resolvable source produces timing residuals in the range ~5-50 ns. Pulsar
Timing Arrays, and in particular the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA), can
plausibly detect these unique systems, although the events are likely to be
rare. These observations would naturally complement on the high-mass end of the
massive black hole distribution function future surveys carried out by the

strength with the formulation of the induced matter theory by Wesson and his

an application of the Campbell-Magaard theorem. In this paper we have tried to

calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces
posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and
pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments
presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency
and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz &
Hobson (2008), which itself significantly outperformed existing MCMC techniques
in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy
of the MultiNest algorithm is demonstrated by application to two toy problems
and to a cosmological inference problem focussing on the extension of the
vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation
of state for dark energy. The MultiNest software, which is fully parallelized
using MPI and includes an interface to CosmoMC, is available at

couplings and the effects of the instability on the spin evolution of young
neutron stars. We include one mode triplet consisting of the r-mode and two
near resonant inertial modes that couple to it. We find that the spectrum of
evolutions is more diverse than previously thought. The evolution of the star
is dynamic and initially dominated by fast neutrino cooling. Nonlinear effects
become important when the r-mode amplitude grows above its first parametric
instability threshold. The balance between neutrino cooling and viscous heating
plays an important role in the evolution. Depending on the initial r-mode
amplitude, and on the strength of the viscosity and of the cooling this balance
can occur at different temperatures. If thermal equilibrium occurs on the
r-mode stability curve, where gravitational driving equals viscous damping, the
evolution may be adequately described by a one-mode model. Otherwise, nonlinear
effects are important and lead to various more complicated scenarios. Once
thermal balance occurs, the star spins-down oscillating between thermal
equilibrium states until the instability is no longer active. For lower
viscosity we observe runaway behavior in which the r-mode amplitude passes
several parametric instability thresholds. In this case more modes need to be
included to model the evolution accurately. In the most optimistic case, we
find that gravitational radiation from the r-mode instability in a very young,
fast spinning neutron star within about 1 Mpc of Earth may be detectable by
advanced LIGO for years, and perhaps decades, after formation. Details
regarding the amplitude and duration of the emission depend on the internal
dissipation of the modes of the star, which would be probed by such detections.

eccentricities of the observed exoplanet population. However, scattering has
not been considered important to the production of pairs of planets in mean
motion resonances (MMRs). We present results from a large number of numerical
simulations of dynamical instabilities in 3-planet systems. We show that MMRs
arise naturally in about five percent of cases. The most common resonances we
populate are the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, although a wide variety of MMRs can occur,
including high-order MMRs (up to eleventh order). MMRs are generated
preferentially in systems with uneven mass distributions: the smallest planet
is typically ejected after a series of close encounters, leaving the remaining,
more massive planets in resonance. The distribution of resonant planets is
consistent with the phase-space density of resonant orbits, meaning that
planets are randomly thrown into MMRs rather than being slowly pulled into
them. It may be possible to distinguish between MMRs created by scattering vs.
convergent migration in a gaseous disk by considering planetary mass ratios:
resonant pairs of planets beyond ~1 AU with more massive outer planets are
likely to have formed by scattering. In addition, scattering may be responsible
for pairs of planets in high-order MMRs (3:1 and higher) that are not easily
populated by migration. The frequency of MMRs from scattering is comparable to
the expected survival rate of MMRs in turbulent disks. Thus, planet-planet
scattering is likely to be a major contributor to the population of resonant
planets.

the existence of a non-vanishing dark energy (DE) density \rho_D in the
Universe, we are still far away from having a fundamental understanding of its
ultimate nature and of its current value, not even of the puzzling fact that
\rho_D is so close to the matter energy density \rho_M at the present time
(i.e. the so-called ""cosmic coincidence"" problem). The resolution of some of
these cosmic conundrums suggests that the DE must have some (mild) dynamical
behavior at the present time. In this paper, we examine some general properties
of the simultaneous set of matter and DE perturbations (\delta\rho_M,
\delta\rho_D) for a multicomponent DE fluid. Next we put these properties to
the test within the context of a non-trivial model of dynamical DE (the LXCDM
model) which has been previously studied in the literature. By requiring that
the coupled system of perturbation equations for \delta\rho_M and \delta\rho_D
has a smooth solution throughout the entire cosmological evolution, that the
matter power spectrum is consistent with the data on structure formation and
that the ""coincidence ratio"" r=\rho_D/\rho_M stays bounded and not unnaturally
high, we are able to determine a well-defined region of the parameter space
where the model can solve the cosmic coincidence problem in full compatibility
with all known cosmological data.

configurations in rotational lines of CS, HCN, C2H, CH3OH, HCO+, and CO
isotopes. Using an iterative minimization technique, observed columns densities
and abundances are derived. These values are further compared with results of
an advanced chemical model that is based on a steady-state flared disk
structure with a vertical temperature gradient, and gas-grain chemical network
with surface reactions. We firmly detect HCO+ in the 1--0 transition,
tentatively detect HCN, and do not detect CS, C2H, and CH3OH. The observed HCO+
and 13CO column densities as well as the upper limits to the column densities
of HCN, CS, C2H, and CH3OH are in good agreement with modeling results and
those from previous studies. The AB Aur disk possesses more CO, but is less
abundant in other molecular species compared to the DM Tau disk. This is
primarily caused by intense UV irradiation from the central Herbig A0 star,
which results in a hotter disk where CO freeze out does not occur and thus
surface formation of complex CO-bearing molecules might be inhibited.

collective paramagnetic or spin liquid regime of this material may be akin to a
spin ice state subject to both thermal and quantum fluctuations $-$ a {\it

field ${\bm B}$ along the $[111]$ direction on the QSI state. To do so, we
investigate the magnetic properties of a microscopic model of Tb2Ti2O7 in an

a model describes semi-quantitatively the collective paramagnetic regime where
nontrivial spin correlations start to develop at the shortest lengthscale, that
is over a single tetrahedron, but where no long range order is yet present. Our
results show that a magnetization plateau develops at low temperatures as the
system develops ${\bm B}=0$ ferromagnetic spin-ice-like ""two-in/two-out""
correlations at the shortest lengthscale. From these results, we are led to
propose that the observation of such a [111] magnetization plateau in Tb2Ti2O7

help guide the development of a theory for the origin of its spin liquid state.

thresholding in any dimension $d$ with a particular emphasis on $d=2$. Towards
this goal, we consider a frame coefficient space over which minimaxity is
proved. The choice of this space is inspired by the characterization provided
in \cite{BorupNielsen} of family of smoothness spaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$, a
subclass of so-called decomposition spaces \cite{Feichtinger}. These smoothness
spaces cover the classical case of Besov spaces, as well as smoothness spaces
corresponding to curvelet-type constructions. Our main theoretical result
investigates the minimax rates over these decomposition spaces, and shows that
our block estimator can achieve the optimal minimax rate, or is at least
nearly-minimax (up to a $\log$ factor) in the least favorable situation.
Another contribution is that the minimax rates given here are stated for a
general noise sequence model in the transform coefficient domain beyond the
usual i.i.d. Gaussian case. The choice of the threshold parameter is
theoretically discussed and its optimal value is stated for some noise models
such as the (non-necessarily i.i.d.) Gaussian case. We provide a simple, fast
and a practical procedure. We also report a comprehensive simulation study to
support our theoretical findings. The practical performance of our Stein block
denoising compares very favorably to the BLS-GSM state-of-the art denoising
algorithm on a large set of test images. A toolbox is made available for
download on the Internet to reproduce the results discussed in this paper.

arcmin$^{-2}$. The emission has a blob-like structure that coincides with an
ionized gas filament observed in mid-infrared images. Contributions of
astrophysical backgrounds and the detected point sources were insignificant.
Thus the emission is diffuse in nature. The X-ray spectrum of the diffuse
emission was represented by a two-temperature plasma model with temperatures of
0.3 and 0.6 keV and an absorption column density of 2$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-1}$.
The X-ray emission showed normal nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios and a high
iron-to-oxygen abundance ratio. The spectrally deduced parameters, such as
temperatures and column densities, are common to the diffuse X-ray emission
near $\eta$ Car. Thus, the diffuse X-ray emission in these two fields may have
the same origin. The spectral fitting results are discussed to constrain the
origin in the context of stellar winds and supernovae.

anisotropy. The measurements have been performed in the film plane in the wide
temperature interval 4.5$\div$300 K. They demonstrate that above films have
low-temperature anomaly below the percolation threshold for conductivity. The
essence of the above peculiarity is that below 100 K the temperature dependence
of coercive field for magnetization along easy direction deviates strongly from
Neel-Brown law. At temperature lowering, the sharp increase of coercivity is
observed, accompanied by the appearance of coercive field for magnetization
along hard direction in the film plane. We establish that observed effect is
related to the properties of individual ferromagnetic granules. The effect
weakens as granules merge into conglomerates at $x$ higher then percolation
threshold and disappears completely at $x>1$. We explain the above effect as a
consequence of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of granule and
cover material. At temperature lowering this difference weakens the envelopment
of an individual granule by the cover matrix material, thus permitting to
realize the spontaneous magnetostriction of a granule. The latter induces an
additional anisotropy with new easy axis of a granule magnetization along the
external magnetic field direction. Our explanation is tested and corroborated
by the ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the films at $T$ = 300 K and $T$

practice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality
illegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more
amenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such
as decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied
form called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java
class files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two
level obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it
more resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is
much more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope
of the different variables used in the program and only very little progress
has been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of
obscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and
usability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool
JDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using
various array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array
folding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system
obfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code
that is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number
of experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our
tool.
