model (SCM) as a proxy to non-linear dynamics. Although the dependence of this
relation on cosmological parameters is known to be weak, we retain the density
parameter Omega_m in SCM equations, in order to study the limit Omega_m -> 0.
We show that in this regime the considered relation is strictly linear, for
arbitrary values of the density contrast, on the contrary to some claims in the
literature. On the other hand, we confirm that for realistic values of Omega_m
the exact relation in the SCM is well approximated by the classic formula of
Bernardeau (1992), both for voids (delta<0) and for overdensities up to delta ~
3. Inspired by this fact, we find further analytic approximations to the
relation for the whole range delta from -1 to infinity. Our formula for voids
accounts for the weak Omega_m-dependence of their maximal rate of expansion,
which for Omega_m < 1 is slightly smaller that 3/2. For positive density
contrasts, we find a simple relation div v = 3 H_0 (Omega_m)^(0.6) [
(1+delta)^(1/6) - (1+delta)^(1/2) ], that works very well up to the turn-around
(i.e. up to delta ~ 13.5 for Omega_m = 0.25 and neglected Omega_Lambda). Having
the same second-order expansion as the formula of Bernardeau, it can be
regarded as an extension of the latter for higher density contrasts. Moreover,
it gives a better fit to results of cosmological numerical simulations.

but isolated equilibrium state or periodic orbit of a dynamical system to
perturbations controlled by one or more independent parameters, and
characteristically uses tools from singularity theory. There are many
situations, however, in which the equilibrium state or periodic orbit is not
isolated but belongs to a manifold $S$ of such states, typically as a result of
continuous symmetries in the problem. In this case the bifurcation analysis
requires a combination of local and global methods, and is most tractable in
the case of normal nondegeneracy, that is when the degeneracy is only along $S$
itself and the system is nondegenerate in directions normal to $S$.
  In this paper we consider the consequences of relaxing normal nondegeneracy,
which can generically occur within 1-parameter families of such systems. We pay
particular attention to the simplest but important case where $\dim S=1$ and
where the normal degeneracy occurs with corank 1. Our main focus is on uniform
degeneracy along $S$, although we also consider aspects of the branching
structure for solutions when the degeneracy varies at different places on $S$.
The tools are those of singularity theory adapted to global topology of $S$,
which allow us to explain the bifurcation geometry in natural way. In
particular, we extend and give a clear geometric setting for earlier analytical
results of Hale and Taboas.

time-reversal symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. We find that
multi-component bosons with spin-orbit coupling provide an unconventional type
of BECs beyond this paradigm. We focus on the subtle case of isotropic Rashba
spin-orbit coupling and the spin-independent interaction. In the limit of the
weak confining potential, the condensate wavefunctions are frustrated at the
Hartree-Fock level due to the degeneracy of the Rashba ring. Quantum zero-point
energy selects the spin-spiral type condensate through the
""order-from-disorder"" mechanism. In a strong harmonic confining trap, the
condensate spontaneously generates a half-quantum vortex combined with the
skyrmion type of spin texture. In both cases, time-reversal symmetry is
spontaneously broken. These phenomena can be realized in both cold atom systems

constraint propagation for a general family of BSSN-type formulation of
Einstein's field equations and identify under what conditions the turducken
procedure is rigorously justified and under what conditions constraint
violations will propagate to the outside of the black holes. We present
high-resolution spherically symmetric studies which verify our analytical
predictions. Then we present three dimensional simulations of single distorted
black holes using different variations of the turduckening method and also the
puncture method. We study the effect that these different methods have on the
coordinate conditions, constraint violations, and extracted gravitational
waves. We find that the waves agree up to small but non-vanishing differences,
caused by escaping superluminal gauge modes. These differences become smaller
with increasing detector location.

physics has begun. Not only is is possible to control outer-shell electron

tunable sources of x-ray radiation. This marriage of strong-field laser and
x-ray physics has led to the discovery of methods to control reversibly
resonant x-ray absorption in atoms and molecules on ultrafast timescales. Using
a strong optical dressing field, resonant x-ray absorption in atoms can be
markedly suppressed, yielding an example of electromagnetically induced
transparency for x rays. Resonant x-ray absorption can also be controlled in
molecules using strong non-resonant, polarized laser fields to align the
framework of a molecule, and therefore its unoccupied molecular orbitals to
which resonant absorption occurs. At higher laser intensities, ultrafast field
ionization produces an irreversible change in x-ray absorption. Finally, the
advent of x-ray free electron lasers enables first exploration of non-linear
x-ray processes.

eavesdropper adversary is considered. The network implements linear network
coding to deliver n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary can
eavesdrop on \mu arbitrarily chosen links. The objective is to provide reliable
communication to all receivers, while guaranteeing that the source information
remains information-theoretically secure from the adversary. A coding scheme is
proposed that can achieve the maximum possible rate of n-\mu packets. The
scheme, which is based on rank-metric codes, has the distinctive property of
being universal: it can be applied on top of any communication network without
requiring knowledge of or any modifications on the underlying network code. The
only requirement of the scheme is that the packet length be at least n, which
is shown to be strictly necessary for universal communication at the maximum
rate. A further scenario is considered where the adversary is allowed not only
to eavesdrop but also to inject up to t erroneous packets into the network, and
the network may suffer from a rank deficiency of at most \rho. In this case,
the proposed scheme can be extended to achieve the rate of n-\rho-2t-\mu
packets. This rate is shown to be optimal under the assumption of zero-error
communication.

quiescence and outburst in 2005 November. Owing to high sensitivity of the HXD
PIN detector and high spectral resolution of the XIS, we have determined
parameters of the plasma with unprecedented precision. The maximum temperature
of the plasma in quiescence 20.4 +4.0-2.6 (stat.) +/- 3.0 (sys.) keV is
significantly higher than that in outburst 6.0 +0.2-1.3 keV. The elemental
abundances are close to the solar ones for the medium-Z elements (Si, S, Ar)
whereas they decline both in lighter and heavier elements. Those of oxygen and
iron are 0.46 and 0.37 solar, respectively. That of carbon is exceptionally
high and 2 solar at least. The solid angle of the reflector subtending over the
optically thin thermal plasma is Omega/2\pi = 1.7+/-0.2 (stat.) +/-0.1 (sys.)
in quiescence. A 6.4 keV iron Ka line is resolved into a narrow and broad
components. These facts indicate that both the white dwarf and the accretion
disk contribute to the continuum reflection and the 6.4 keV iron Ka line. We
consider the standard optically thin boundary layer as the most plausible
picture for the plasma configuration in quiescence. The solid angle of the
reflector in outburst Omega/2\pi = 0.9 +0.5-0.4 and a broad 6.4 keV iron line
indicates that the reflection in outburst originates from the accretion disk
and an equatorial accretion belt. From the energy width of the 6.4 keV line, we
consider the optically thin thermal plasma in outburst as being distributed on
the accretion disk like solar coronae.

and $f$ is any analytic function - have recently attracted a lot of interest as
alternative candidates to explain the observed cosmic acceleration, the
flatness of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and other relevant
astrophysical phenomena. It is a crucial point testing these alternative
theories in the so called weak field and newtonian limit of a $f(R,
R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta})$ - theory. With this ""perturbation technique""
it is possible to find spherically symmetric solutions and compare them with
the ones of General Relativity. On both approaches we found a modification of
General Relativity: the behaviour of gravitational potential presents a
modification Yukawa - like in the newtonian case and a massive propagation in
the weak field case. When the modification of the theory is removed (i.e. $f(R,
R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta}) = R$, Hilbert - Einstein lagrangian) we find
the usual outcomes of General Relativity. Also the Noether symmetries technique
has been investigated to find some time independent spherically symmetric

This group is a subgroup of the group $C_n(\pi)$ which consists of the elements

these groups coincide and the computation of them is one of the basic problems
of surgery theory. The computation of the group $C_n(\pi)$ is equivalent to the

communication networks with random access is an example of such an algorithm.
In computer science, this corresponds to a trie structure with a dynamic input.
Mathematically, it is related to a stopped branching process with exogeneous
arrivals (immigration). Under quite general assumptions on the distribution of
the number of arrivals and on the branching procedure, it is shown that there
exists a positive constant $\lambda_c$ so that if the arrival rate is smaller
than $\lambda_c$, then the algorithm is stable under the flow of requests, that
is, that the total size of an associated tree is integrable. At the same time,
a gap in the earlier proofs of stability in the literature is fixed. When the
arrivals are Poisson, an explicit characterization of $\lambda_c$ is given.
Under the stability condition, the asymptotic behavior of the average size of a
tree starting with a large number of individuals is analyzed. The results are
obtained with the help of a probabilistic rewriting of the functional equations
describing the dynamics of the system. The proofs use extensively this
stochastic background throughout the paper. In this analysis, two basic limit
theorems play a key role: the renewal theorem and the convergence to
equilibrium of an auto-regressive process with a moving average.

over a base S are considered as fundamental objects which describe space-time.
This yields a formulation of general relativity which is covariant with respect
to changes of the chosen domain of numbers S. With regard to adelic physics the
choice of S as an excellent Dedekind scheme is of interest (because this way
also the finite prime spots, i.e. the p-adic degrees of freedom are taken into
account). In this arithmetic case, it turns out that X is a Neron model. This
enables us to make concrete statements concerning the structure of the

by the renormalization of $\phi_\star^4$ theory in the canonical
$\theta$-deformed noncommutativity. We focus on the classical limit of the
theory described by a single parameter which is the ratio of the vulcanization
and the noncommutativity parameters. We perform numerical calculations and find
that nontopological vortex solutions exist as well as Q-ball type solutions,
but topological vortex solutions are not admitted.

  Computation","4 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum computers promise dramatic speed ups for many computational tasks.
For large-scale quantum computation however, the inevitable coupling of
physical qubits to the noisy environment imposes a major challenge for a
real-life implementation. A scheme introduced by Gottesmann and Chuang can help
to overcome this difficulty by performing universal quantum gates in a
fault-tolerant manner. Here, we report a non-trivial demonstration of this
architecture by performing a teleportation-based two-qubit controlled-NOT gate
through linear optics with a high-fidelity six-photon interferometer. The
obtained results clearly prove the involved working principles and the
entangling capability of the gate. Our experiment represents an important step
towards the feasibility of realistic quantum computers and could trigger many
further applications in linear optics quantum information processing.

users can copy ""components"" into their own Excel or Google spreadsheets.
Components are collections of cells containing formulae: in real life, they
would do useful calculations that many practitioners find hard to program, and
would be rigorously tested and documented. Crucially, the user can tell the
repository which cells in their spreadsheet to use for a componen's inputs and
outputs. The repository will then reshape the component to fit. A single
component can therefore be used in many different sizes and shapes of
spreadsheet. We hope to set up a spreadsheet equivalent of the high-quality
numerical subroutine libraries that revolutionised scientific computing, but
where instead of subroutines, the library contains such components.

state of undoped La$_2$CuO$_4$ and strong antiferromagnetic coupling $J$
between neighbouring spins. We consider magnetic mechanism of superconducting
pairing in the effective low energy $t - t' - t"" - J^*$ model with all
parameters calculated {\it ab initio}. Interaction of strongly correlated
electrons with different phonon modes is also incorporated. In a BCS type
theory the $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ gap is given by a sum of magnetic and phonon
contributions. The phonon coupling parameter $\lambda = f(x)G$, where $G$ is a
combination of bare electron-phonon couplings for all modes and the function
$f$ depends on the hole concentration $x$ due to strong electron correlations.
The main contribution to the only fitting parameter $G$ is determined by a
competition of the breathing and buckling modes. Fitting the parameter $G$ from
the isotope effect we obtain that magnetic and phonon contributions to the
critical temperature $T_c $ work together and are of the same order of
magnitude.

liquids (QHL) of different filling factors, $\nu_{0,1}=1/(2 m_{0,1}+1)$, with
$m_0 \geq m_1\geq 0$, through two separate point contacts in the geometry of

Neder et al., Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett. {\bf 96}, 016804 (2006)]. The quasi-particle
formulation of the interferometer model is derived as a dual to the initial
electron model, in the limit of strong electron tunneling reached at large
voltages or temperatures. For $m\equiv 1+m_{0}+m_{1}>1$, the tunneling of
quasiparticles of fractional charge $e/m$ leads to non-trivial $m$-state
dynamics of effective flux through the interferometer, which restores the
regular ""electron"" periodicity of the current in flux despite the fractional
charge and statistics of quasiparticles. The exact solution available for equal
times of propagation between the contacts along the two edges demonstrates that
the interference pattern of modulation of the tunneling current by flux depends
on voltage and temperature only through a common amplitude.
