symmetry. This implies strict constraints on the possible models of
non-standard neutrino interactions, which we analyze. The focus is set on the
effective low-energy dimension six and eight operators involving four leptons,
decomposing them according to all possible tree-level mediators, as a guide for
model building. The new couplings are required to have sizeable strength, while
processes involving four charged leptons are required to be suppressed. For
non-standard interactions in matter, only diagonal tau-neutrino interactions
can escape these requirements and can be allowed to result from dimension six
operators. Large non-standard neutrino interactions from dimension eight
operators alone are phenomenologically allowed in all flavour channels and
shown to require at least two new mediator particles. The new couplings must
obey general cancellation conditions both at the dimension six and eight
levels, which result from expressing the operators obtained from the mediator
analysis in terms of a complete basis of operators. We illustrate with one
example how to apply this information to model building.

theory and phenomenology. After explaining the potential for predictive string
phenomenology within this framework, we introduce the ingredients of F-theory
GUTs, and show how these models naturally address various puzzles in
four-dimensional GUT models. We next describe how supersymmetry is broken, and
show that in a broad class of models, solving the mu/B mu problem requires a
specific scale of supersymmetry breaking consistent with a particular
deformation of the gauge mediation scenario. This rigid structure enables us to
reliably extract predictions for the sparticle spectrum of the MSSM. A brief
sketch of expected LHC signals, as well as ways to falsify this class of models

from the Millennium Simulation at z=0 with three semi-analytic models (SAMs) of
galaxy formation. CGs are identified using the same 2D criteria as those
visually applied by Hickson (1982) to his CGs (HCGs), but with a brightest
galaxy magnitude limit, and the blending of close projected pairs. Half of the
mock CGs identified in projection contain at least 4 accordant velocities
(mvCGs), versus 70% for HCGs. In comparison to mvCGs, the HCGs are only 8%
complete at distances < 9000 km/s, missing the CGs with small angular sizes, a
strongly dominant galaxy, and (for one SAM) the CGs that are fainter and those
with lower surface brightness. We explore different ways to determine the
fraction of physically dense groups. Binding energy criteria turn out to be
inapplicable given the segregation between galaxies and dark matter particles.
We rely instead on the combination of the 3D length of the CGs (maximum real
space galaxy separation) and their elongation along the line-of-sight (ratio of
maximum line-of-sight to maximum projected separations), restricting ourselves
in both cases to smallest quartets within the CGs. We find that between 64% and
80% (depending on the SAM) of the mvCGs have 3D lengths shorter than 200 kpc/h,
between 71% and 80% have line-of-sight elongations less than 2, while between
59% and 76% have either 3D lengths shorter than 100 kpc/h or both lengths
shorter than 200 kpc/h and elongations smaller than 2. Therefore, chance
alignments (CAs) of galaxies concern at most 40% of the mvCGs. These CAs are
mostly produced from larger host groups, but a few have galaxies extending a
few Mpc beyond the host group. The mvCGs built with the Hickson selection with
(without) the close projected pair blending criterion have 10% higher (lower)
fractions of physically dense systems.

characterized by clear signatures of the magnetic instability. A
self-consistent picture emerges in which below the magnetic transition carrier
condensation occurs due to the opening of spin density wave (SDW) gap. This is
accompanied by the mobility increase of not gapped carriers due to the
suppression of electron-electron scattering. SmFeAs(O0.93F0.07) exhibits an
increase of the metallic character on cooling consistent with electron doping,
even though at room temperature values of all the properties nearly overlaps
with those of SmFeAsO. However, with temperature decrease all anomalies related
to the SDW instability are missed and the superconducting transition occurs.
This suggests that doping breaks abruptly the symmetries of the Fermi surface
inhibiting the SDW formation in favor of the superconducting transition, with
no substantial changes in the density of states or in the effective mass.

concentrate on one such effect, ambipolar diffusion, which enables the field
lines to slip relative to the bulk neutral matter. We find that the slippage
does not sufficiently weaken the braking to allow rotationally supported disks
to form for realistic levels of cloud magnetization and cosmic ray ionization
rate; in some cases, the magnetic braking is even enhanced. Only in dense cores
with both exceptionally weak fields and unreasonably low ionization rate do
such disks start to form in our simulations. We conclude that additional
processes, such as Ohmic dissipation or Hall effect, are needed to enable disk

the multicast capacity of random wireless ad hoc networks when nodes are
endowed with multi-packet transmission (MPT) and multi-packet reception (MPR)
capabilities. We show that a per session throughput capacity of
$\Theta(nT^{3}(n))$, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and T(n) is the
communication range, can be achieved as a tight bound when each session
contains a constant number of sinks. Surprisingly, an identical order capacity
can be achieved when nodes have only MPR and MPT capabilities. This result
proves that NC does not contribute to the order capacity of multicast traffic
in wireless ad hoc networks when MPR and MPT are used in the network. The
result is in sharp contrast to the general belief (conjecture) that NC improves
the order capacity of multicast. Furthermore, if the communication range is
selected to guarantee the connectivity in the network, i.e., $T(n)\ge
\Theta(\sqrt{\log n/n})$, then the combination of MPR and MPT achieves a
throughput capacity of $\Theta(\frac{\log^{{3/2}} n}{\sqrt{n}})$ which provides
an order capacity gain of $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ compared to the point-to-point
multicast capacity with the same number of destinations.

Energy density is found to be related to bubble formation and as centrality
decreases the maximum energy density and bubbles shift from symmetry around the
beam axis to the reaction plane region causing a strong correlation of bubble
formation with elliptic flow. We obtained reasonably quantitative agreement
(within a few percent of the total correlations) with a new precision RHIC
experiment which extended the centrality region investigated to the range 0-80%
(most central to most peripheral). The characteristics and behavior of the
bubbles imply they represent a significant substructure formed on the surface
of the fireball at kinetic freezeout

high opacity and resonance scattering properties of this line offer a powerful
probe of the geometry of both the funnel flow and the inner wind that, together
with other atomic and molecular spectral lines covering a wide range of

the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations which is naturally

so: First, the taxonomy has been widely used. Therefore, it should have
scrutiny; Second, the taxonomy has not been widely available in its original
form and most users refer to secondary sources. Consequently, they often equate
the taxonomy with the simplified extracts used in particular experiments or
field studies; Third, perhaps as a consequence, most users use only a fraction
of the taxonomy. In particular, they tend not to use the taxonomy's life-cycle
dimension; Fourth, the taxonomy has been tested against spreadsheets in
experiments and spreadsheets in operational use. It is time to review how it
has fared in these tests; Fifth, the taxonomy was based on the types of
spreadsheet errors that were known to the authors in the mid-1990s. Subsequent
experience has shown that the taxonomy needs to be extended for situations
beyond those original experiences; Sixth, the omission category in the taxonomy
has proven to be too narrow. Although this paper will focus on the
Panko-Halverson taxonomy, this does not mean that that it is the only possible
error taxonomy or even the best error taxonomy.

equations around Schwarzschild's spacetime were reduced by Zerilli to a 1+1
wave equation with a potential $V$, on a field $\Psi_z$. For smooth metric
perturbations $\Psi_z$ is singular at $r_s=-6M/(\ell-1)(\ell+2)$, $\ell$ the
mode harmonic number, and $V$ has a second order pole at $r_s$. This is
irrelevant to the black hole exterior stability problem, where $r>2M>0$, and
$r_s <0$, but it introduces a non trivial problem in the naked singular case
where $M<0$, then $r_s>0$, and the singularity appears in the relevant range of
$r$. We solve this problem by developing a new approach to the evolution of the
even mode, based on a {\em new gauge invariant function}, $\hat \Psi$ -related
to $\Psi_z$ by an intertwiner operator- that is a regular function of the
metric perturbation {\em for any value of $M$}. This allows to address the
issue of evolution of gravitational perturbations in this non globally
hyperbolic background, and to complete the proof of the linear instability of
the Schwarzschild naked singularity, by showing that a previously found
unstable mode is excitable by generic initial data. This is further illustrated
by numerically solving the linearized equations for suitably chosen initial
data.

transition. Groove water, however, exhibits markedly different temperature
dependence of its properties from the bulk. Entropy calculations reveal that
the minor groove water is ordered even at room temperature and the transition
at $T \approx$ 255 K can be characterized as a {\em strong-to-strong} dynamical
transition. The low temperature water is characterized by pronounced
tetrahedral order, as manifested in the sharp rise near $109^{\circ}$ in the
O-O-O angle distribution. We find that Adams-Gibbs relation between
configurational entropy and translational diffusion holds quite well when the
two quantities are plotted together in a master plot for different region of

phase always start on the high state (the values of $E_{peak}$ are always
higher than 50 keV); 2) the spectra of rise phase clearly start at higher
energy (the median of $E_{peak}$ are about 300 keV), whereas the spectra of
decay phase end at much lower energy (the median of $E_{peak}$ are about 200
keV); 3) the spectra of rise phase are harder than that of the decay phase and
the duration of rise phase are much shorter than that of decay phase as well.
In other words, for a complete pulse the initial $E_{peak}$ is higher than the
final $E_{peak}$ and the duration of initial phase (rise phase) are much
shorter than the final phase (decay phase). This results are in good agreement
with the predictions of Lu et al. (2007) and current popular view on the

be relate to both of kinematic and dynamic process even if we currently can not
provide further evidences to distinguish which one is dominant. Moreover, our
statistical results give some witnesses to constrain the current GRB model.

the birth of our universe. Much of the dilemma over the last decades comes from
the extraordinarily small probability that the universe started with the high
energy Big Bang as compared to the chance of nucleating any other event. How
can Big Bang cosmology be $10^{10^{123}}$ times less likely than nucleating the
present cold universe, while accumulating such exquisite agreement with
astrophysical data? Why don't we see the other nucleations that, if left to
chance, seem to overwhelmingly outnumber us? Here I discuss the point of view
that the selection of the initial conditions can be meaningfully addressed only
within the framework of the multiverse and that the reason why Big Bang
inflation was preferred over other events lies in the quantum dynamics of the
landscape of the initial patches. The out-of-equilibrium dynamics selected the
'survivor' universes be born at high energies and the 'terminal' universes at
low energies. I briefly review the testable predictions of this theory, in
particular the giant void observed in 2007. The second part focuses on the
extended framework, in particular a set of postulates needed for defining the
multiverse.

corresponding to different model parameters, the fidelity susceptibility and
the von Neumann entropy of the lowest band edge states, and the
spectrum-averaged von Neumann entropy are studied numerically, respectively.
The fidelity is near one when parameters are in the same phase or same phase
boundary; otherwise it is close to zero. There are drastic changes in fidelity
when one parameter is at phase boundaries. For fidelity susceptibility the
finite scaling analysis performed, the critical exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$,
and $\nu$ depend on system sizes for the metal-metal phase transition, while
not for the metal-insulator phase transition. For both phase transitions
$\nu/\alpha\approx2$. The von Neumann entropy is near one for the metallic
phase, while small for the insulating phase. There are sharp changes in von
Neumann entropy at phase boundaries. According to the variation of the
fidelity, fidelity susceptibility, and von Neumann entropy with model

insulating phase separated by three critical lines with one bicritical point,

introduced by Gottlob, Leone, and Scarcello in order to extend the concept of
hypergraph acyclicity. These notions were further generalized by Grohe and
Marx, who introduced the fractional hypertree width of a hypergraph. All these
width parameters on hypergraphs are useful for extending tractability of many
problems in database theory and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we
study the approximability of (generalized, fractional) hyper treewidth of
sparse hypergraphs where the criterion of sparsity reflects the sparsity of
their incidence graphs. Our first step is to prove that the (generalized,
fractional) hypertree width of a hypergraph H is constant-factor sandwiched by
the treewidth of its incidence graph, when the incidence graph belongs to some
apex-minor-free graph class. This determines the combinatorial borderline above
which the notion of (generalized, fractional) hypertree width becomes
essentially more general than treewidth, justifying that way its functionality
as a hypergraph acyclicity measure. While for more general sparse families of
hypergraphs treewidth of incidence graphs and all hypertree width parameters
may differ arbitrarily, there are sparse families where a constant factor
approximation algorithm is possible. In particular, we give a constant factor
approximation polynomial time algorithm for (generalized, fractional) hypertree
width on hypergraphs whose incidence graphs belong to some H-minor-free graph
class.

persistent feasibility, and we provide a localized procedure for constructing
an initial feasible solution by constraint tightening. Moreover, we show that
the solution of the iterative process converges to the centralized MPC
solution. The proposed iterative approach involves solving local optimization
problems consisting of only few subsystems, depending on the choice of the
designer and the sparsity of dynamical and constraint couplings. The gain in
the overall computational load compared to the centralized problem is balanced
by the increased communication requirements. This makes our approach more
applicable to situations where the number of subsystems is large, the coupling
is sparse, and local communication is relatively fast and cheap. A numerical
example illustrates the effects of the local problem size, and the number of
iterations on convergence to the centralized solution.

well suited to such naturally sparse image applications as it seamlessly
accounts for properties such as sparsity and positivity of the image via
appropriate Bayes priors. We propose a prior that is based on a weighted
mixture of a positive exponential distribution and a mass at zero. The prior
has hyperparameters that are tuned automatically by marginalization over the
hierarchical Bayesian model. To overcome the complexity of the posterior
distribution, a Gibbs sampling strategy is proposed. The Gibbs samples can be
used to estimate the image to be recovered, e.g. by maximizing the estimated
posterior distribution. In our fully Bayesian approach the posteriors of all
the parameters are available. Thus our algorithm provides more information than
other previously proposed sparse reconstruction methods that only give a point
estimate. The performance of our hierarchical Bayesian sparse reconstruction
method is illustrated on synthetic and real data collected from a tobacco virus
sample using a prototype MRFM instrument.

attempt to model the spectra of these atmospheres must incorporate a cloud

large and it is not always clear how the underlying physics of the various
models compare. Likewise the observational consequences of different modeling

a point of reference (nu(4)=1/2) gives a scaling exponent nu(d) = 1/4 +1/d, in
agreement with the accepted result for two-dimensions (nu(2) = 3/4) and the

abundances in the innermost layers are several orders of magnitudes lower. On
the other hand, molecules that are typical of late-time chemistry are usually
more abundant in the inner parts of the PDR. We also present results for models
with different density, temperature, intensity of the radiation field and

of H2O, the long integration time (152 miutes on target) enabled eight weaker
H2O features to be assigned, most of which had not previously been identified
in cometary spectra. These transitions, which are from higher energy upper
states, are similar in character to the so-called 'SH' lines recorded in the
post Deep Impact spectrum of comet Tempel 1 (Barber et al., 2007). We have
identified certain characteristics that these lines have in common, and which
in addition to helping to define this new class of cometary line, give some
clues to the physical processes involved in their production. Finally, we
derive an H2O rotational temperature of 62+/- K and a water production rate of

of a ceramic structure of parallel square channels: 1mm by 1 mm in cross
section, 65 mm in length, and a surface density of 400 channels/inch square.
The channels are rigidly terminated, thus constituting a locally reacting
structure. In the absence of flow the liner reacts classically: There is a
significant decrease in transmission coefficient around the frequency of
minimal impedance. When the wall is exposed to a grazing flow this behaviour is
changed: an increase in transmission coefficient appears at this resonance
frequency. The transmission coefficient can be even rise above 1 (up to 3 for a
Mach number of 0.3). This behaviour is caused by the appearance of a
hydrodynamic instability above the liner. Furthermore, the stationary pressure
drop induced by this liner is deeply affected by its acoustic behaviour. When a
sound wave is added, at the resonance frequency of the liner, the pressure drop
can increase by a factor 3 when the Mach number is 0.3. This effect is
attributed to a modification of the turbulent boundary layer induced by the
acoustic wave.

of network construction strategies, and their effect on the predicted
properties. The analysis is based on the radial distribution function and the
spectral dimensions of a large set of proteins as well as a newly defined
quantity, the angular distribution function. By partitioning the interactions
into an essential and a residual set, we show that the robustness originates
from a large number of long-distance interactions belonging to the latter.
These residuals have a vanishingly small effect on the force vectors on each
residue. The overall force balance then translates into the Hessian as small
shifts in the slow modes of motion and an invariance of the corresponding
eigenvectors. Implications for the study of biologically relevant properties of
proteins are discussed.

telescope, an instrument built to demonstrate the principles of dispersed fixed
delay interferometry. An iodine cell allows the interferometer drift to be
accurately calibrated, relaxing the stability requirements on the
interferometer itself. When using our monolithic interferometer, the ET
instrument has no moving parts (except the iodine cell), greatly simplifying
its operation. We demonstrate differential radial velocity precision of a few m
s$^{-1}$ on well known radial velocity standards and planet bearing stars when
using this interferometer. Such monolithic interferometers will make it
possible to build relatively inexpensive instruments that are easy to operate
and capable of precision radial velocity measurements. A larger multi-object
version of the Exoplanet Tracker will be used to conduct a large scale survey
for planetary systems as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS III).
Variants of the techniques and principles discussed in this paper can be
directly applied to build large monolithic interferometers for such
applications, enabling the construction of instruments capable of efficiently
observing many stars simultaneously at high velocity-precision.

is removed from its edge set. The class of alpha-critical graphs has several
nice structural properties, most of them related to their defect which is the
number of vertices minus two times the stability number. In particular, a
remarkable result of Lov\'asz (1978) is the finite basis theorem for
alpha-critical graphs of a fixed defect. The class of alpha-critical graphs is
also of interest for at least two topics of polyhedral studies. First,
Chv\'atal (1975) shows that each alpha-critical graph induces a rank inequality
which is facet-defining for its stable set polytope. Investigating a weighted
generalization, Lipt\'ak and Lov\'asz (2000, 2001) introduce critical
facet-graphs (which again produce facet-defining inequalities for their stable
set polytopes) and they establish a finite basis theorem. Second, Koppen (1995)
describes a construction that delivers from any alpha-critical graph a
facet-defining inequality for the linear ordering polytope. Doignon, Fiorini
and Joret (2006) handle the weighted case and thus define facet-defining
graphs. Here we investigate relationships between the two weighted
generalizations of alpha-critical graphs. We show that facet-defining graphs
(for the linear ordering polytope) are obtainable from 1-critical facet-graphs
(linked with stable set polytopes). We then use this connection to derive
various results on facet-defining graphs, the most prominent one being derived
from Lipt\'ak and Lov\'asz's finite basis theorem for critical facet-graphs. At
the end of the paper we offer an alternative proof of Lov\'asz's finite basis
theorem for alpha-critical graphs.

not only creates a three-dimensional chaotic mixing region, which operates
through the stretching and folding of material lines, but also offers the
possibility of controlling both the size and the location of the mixing. Such a
control is achieved by judiciously adjusting the three parameters that
characterize the rotation, i.e., the rotation amplitude, frequency and
orientation of the rotation. As the size of the mixing region is increased,
complete mixing within the drop is obtained.

various aspects of sparse representations and compressed sensing. Most of this
work has focused on the finite-dimensional setting in which the goal is to
decompose a finite-length vector into a given finite dictionary. Underlying
many of these results is the conceptual notion of an uncertainty principle: a
signal cannot be sparsely represented in two different bases. Here, we extend
these ideas and results to the analog, infinite-dimensional setting by
considering signals that lie in a finitely-generated shift-invariant (SI)
space. This class of signals is rich enough to include many interesting special
cases such as multiband signals and splines. By adapting the notion of
coherence defined for finite dictionaries to infinite SI representations, we
develop an uncertainty principle similar in spirit to its finite counterpart.
We demonstrate tightness of our bound by considering a bandlimited lowpass
train that achieves the uncertainty principle. Building upon these results and
similar work in the finite setting, we show how to find a sparse decomposition
in an overcomplete dictionary by solving a convex optimization problem. The
distinguishing feature of our approach is the fact that even though the problem
is defined over an infinite domain with infinitely many variables and
constraints, under certain conditions on the dictionary spectrum our algorithm
can find the sparsest representation by solving a finite-dimensional problem.
