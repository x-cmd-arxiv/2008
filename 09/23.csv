diffeomorphism group in quantum gravity. Some insight into these important
questions may be gained by looking at certain aspects of general covariance and
observables in classical gravitational theory.
  In this paper I shall define as set of classical geometric observables of the
gravitational field by which I mean Diff(M)-gauge invariant cohomology classes
defined on a Lorentzian structure. They represent global characteristics of the
physical gravitational phenomena, are linked to the topology of the spacetime,
and can be used in constructing new Lagrangians.
  The problem of finding a complete set of data out of observables is related
perhaps to the fact that at present moment, manifolds in dimension 4 and above
cannot be effectively classified. One could interpret this result as a pointer
to the possibility that there might be spacetimes with different topologies
(i.e., different global characteristics) which have indistinguishable local

combining it into a cumulative statistic which preserves the bulk motion
component with the noise integrated down. Such statistic is the dipole of CMB
temperature fluctuations evaluated over the pixels of the cluster catalog
(Kashlinsky & Atrio-Barandela 2000). To remove the cosmological CMB
fluctuations the maps are Wiener-filtered in each of the eight WMAP channels
(Q, V, W) which have negligible foreground component. Our findings are as
follows: The thermal SZ (TSZ) component of the clusters is described well by
the Navarro-Frenk-White profile expected if the hot gas traces the dark matter
in the cluster potential wells. Such gas has X-ray temperature decreasing
rapidly towards the cluster outskirts, which we demonstrate results in the
decrease of the TSZ component as the aperture is increased to encompass the
cluster outskirts. We then detect a statistically significant dipole in the CMB
pixels at cluster positions. Arising exclusively at the cluster pixels this
dipole cannot originate from the foreground or instrument noise emissions and
must be produced by the CMB photons which interacted with the hot intracluster
gas via the SZ effect. The dipole remains as the monopole component, due to the
TSZ effect, vanishes within the small statistical noise out to the maximal
aperture where we still detect the TSZ component. We demonstrate with
simulations that the mask and cross-talk effects are small for our catalog and
contribute negligibly to the measurements. The measured dipole thus arises from
the KSZ effect produced by the coherent large scale bulk flow motion.

spectral measurements made in the mid-infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope
and the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The aim is to determine the chemical
composition of these objects. We also make use of International Ultraviolet
Explorer (IUE) and ground based spectra. These elliptical PNe are interesting
because they are well-studied, nearby, bright objects and therefore allow a
reasonably complete comparison of this type of nebulae. Abundances determined
from the mid-infrared lines, which are insensitive to electron temperature, are
used as the basis for the determination of the composition, which are found to
differ somewhat from earlier results. The abundances found, especially the low
value of helium and oxygen, indicate that the central star was originally of
rather low mass. The abundance of phosphorus has been determined for the first
time in NGC3242. The electron temperature in both of these nebulae is roughly
constant unlike NGC6302 and NGC2392 where a strong temperature gradient is
found. The temperature of the central star is discussed for both nebulae.
Finally a comparison of the element abundances in these nebulae with the solar
abundance is made. The low abundance of Fe and P is noted and it is suggested
that these elements are an important constituent of the nebular dust.

disks is one of the most important problems that needs to be solved in light of
observations of the exosolar planets. Studies of the migration of planets in
standard gas disk models routinely show that migration is too fast to form
Jovian planets, and that such migrating planetary cores generally plunge into
the central stars in less than a Myr. In previous work, we have shown that a
poorly ionized, less viscous region in a protoplanetary disk called a dead zone
slows down the migration of fixed-mass planets. In this paper, we extend our
numerical calculations to include dead zone evolution along with the disk, as
well as planet formation via accretion of rocky and gaseous materials. Using
our symplectic-integrator-gas dynamics code, we find that dead zones, even in
evolving disks wherein migrating planets grow by accretion, still play a
fundamental role in saving planetary systems. We demonstrate that Jovian
planets form within 2.5 Myr for disks that are ten times more massive than a
minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) with an opacity reduction and without slowing
down migration artificially. Our simulations indicate that protoplanetary disks
with an initial mass comparable to the MMSN only produce Neptunian mass
planets. We also find that planet migration does not help core accretion as
much in the oligarchic planetesimal accretion scenario as it was expected in
the runaway accretion scenario. Therefore we expect that an opacity reduction
(or some other mechanisms) is needed to solve the formation timescale problem
even for migrating protoplanets, as long as we consider the oligarchic growth.
We also point out a possible role of a dead zone in explaining long-lived,
strongly accreting gas disks.

observed population of young stars could have originated from a large angle
collision of two massive gaseous clouds at R approx. 1 parsec from Sgr A*. In
all the simulations performed, the post-collision gas flow forms an inner,
nearly circular gaseous disc and one or two eccentric outer filaments,
consistent with the observations. Furthermore, the radial stellar mass
distribution is always very steep, Sigma proportional to R^-2, again consistent
with the observations. All of our simulations produce discs that are warped by
between 30 to 60 degrees, in accordance with the most recent observations. The
3D velocity structure of the stellar distribution is sensitive to initial
conditions (e.g., the impact parameter of the clouds) and gas cooling details.
For example, the runs in which the inner disc is fed intermittently with
material possessing fluctuating angular momentum result in multiple stellar
discs with different orbital orientations, contradicting the observed data. In
all the cases the amount of gas accreted by our inner boundary condition is
large, enough to allow Sgr A* to radiate near its Eddington limit over approx.
10^5 years. This suggests that a refined model would have physically larger
clouds (or a cloud and a disc such as the circumnuclear disc) colliding at a
distance of a few parsecs rather than 1 parsec as in our simulations.

relaxes as $1/t$ for the phantom polymer in both cases; the self-avoiding

factors as the change in the scientific paradigm from a dialectic opposition
between theory and observation to an emphasis on simulation and observational
programs, the inordinate growth of administration in universities and the
consequent increase in importance of grant overhead, and the hierarchical
nature of formal scientific organizations are cosidered. This paper will deal
with the origin of the cultural changes and with specific examples of the

relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural
logarithmic scatter about the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is
about 70%, and about the X-ray luminosity-Y_X relation it is 40%. Cool core and
morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space
with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically
to the high luminosity side, the latter to the low luminosity side. Exclusion
of the central regions serves to reduce the scatter by more than 50%. Using Y_X
as a mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias corrected luminosity-mass relation
and compare with previous determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity
can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important
implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be
undertaken with Planck and eROSITA, and ultimately for the use of clusters for
cosmological purposes.

Eddington ratio distribution. Models for self-regulated BH growth, in which
feedback produces a 'blowout' decay phase after some peak luminosity (shutting
down accretion) make specific predictions for the lifetimes distinct from those

sits in equilibrium, while the gas develops a gradual, smooth, quasi-stationary
cooling flow. Both affect and respond to the collective gravitational field. We
find that all subsonic, radially continuous, steady solutions require a
non-zero minimum central point mass. For Mpc-sized halos with 7 to 10 effective
degrees of freedom (F2), the minimum central mass is compatible with
observations of supermassive black holes. Smaller gas mass influxes enable
smaller central masses for wider ranges of F2. The halo comprises a sharp spike
around the central mass, embedded within a core of nearly constant density (at
10-10^2.5kpc scales), with outskirts that attenuate and naturally truncate at
finite radius (several Mpc). The gas density resembles a broken power law in
radius, but the temperature dips and peaks within the dark core. A finite
minimum temperature occurs due to gravitational self-warming, without cold mass
dropout nor needing regulatory heating. X-ray emission from the intracluster
medium mimics a beta-model plus bright compact nucleus. Near-sonic points in
the gas flow are bottlenecks to allowed steady solutions; the outermost are at
kpc scales. These sites may preferentially develop cold mass dropout during
strong perturbations off equilibrium. Within the sonic point, the profile of
gas specific entropy is flatter than s r^{1/2}, but this is a shallow ramp and
not an isentropic core. When F2 is large, the inner halo spike is only
marginally Jeans stable in the central pc, suggesting that a large non-linear
disturbance could trigger local dark collapse onto the central object.

expected velocity semi-amplitude of K ~ 220 m/s (M/M_J). We conduct Monte Carlo
transit injection and recovery simulations to calculate the 95% confidence
upper limit on the fraction of cluster members and field stars with planets as
a function of planetary radius and orbital period. Assuming a uniform
logarithmic distribution in orbital period, we find that < 1.1%, < 2.7% and <

planets we can only place an upper limit of < 25% on the EHJ period range. For
a sample of 7814 Galactic field stars, consisting primarily of FGKM dwarfs, we
place 95% upper limits of < 0.3%, < 0.8% and < 2.7% on the fraction of stars
with 1.0 R_J EHJ, VHJ and HJ assuming the candidate planet is not genuine. If
the candidate is genuine, the frequency of ~ 1.0 R_J planets in the EHJ period
range is 0.002% < f_EHJ < 0.5% with 95% confidence. We place limits of < 1.4%,
< 8.8% and < 47% for 0.5 R_J planets, and a limit of < 16% on 0.3 R_J planets

differences from comparable untilted disks, such as asymmetrical accretion onto
the hole through opposing ""plunging streams"" and global precession of the disk
powered by a torque provided by the black hole. However, those simulations used
a traditional spherical-polar grid that was purposefully underresolved along
the pole, which prevented us from assessing the behavior of any jets that may
have been associated with the tilted disks. To address this shortcoming we have
added a block-structured ""cubed-sphere"" grid option to the Cosmos++ GRMHD code,
which will allow us to simultaneously resolve the disk and polar regions. Here
we present our implementation of this grid and the results of a small suite of
validation tests intended to demonstrate that the new grid performs as
expected. The most important test in this work is a comparison of identical
tilted disks, one evolved using our spherical-polar grid and the other with the
cubed-sphere grid. We also demonstrate an interesting dependence of the
early-time evolution of our disks on their orientation with respect to the grid
alignment. This dependence arises from the differing treatment of current
sheets within the disks, especially whether they are aligned with symmetry
planes of the grid or not.

the correlations between molecular hydrogen and various extinction parameters
in the full sample, which covers a broader range of conditions than the initial
sample. In particular, we are now able to confirm that many, but not all, lines
of sight with shallow far-UV extinction curves and large values of the
total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$ = $A_V$ / $E(B-V)$ -- characteristic
of larger than average dust grains -- are associated with particularly low
hydrogen molecular fractions ($f_{\rm H2}$). In the lines of sight with large
$R_V$, there is in fact a wide range in molecular fractions, despite the
expectation that the larger grains should lead to less H$_2$ formation.
However, we see specific evidence that the molecular fractions in this
sub-sample are inversely related to the estimated strength of the UV radiation
field and thus the latter factor is more important in this regime. We have
provided an update to previous values of the gas-to-dust ratio, $N$(H$_{\rm
tot}$)/$E(B-V)$, based on direct measurements of $N$(H$_2$) and $N$(H I).
Although our value is nearly identical to that found with Copernicus data, it
extends the relationship by a factor of 2 in reddening. Finally, as the new
lines of sight generally show low to moderate molecular fractions, we still
find little evidence for single monolithic ""translucent clouds"" with $f_{\rm
H2}$ $\sim$ 1.

their intrinsic scatter, and a determination of the Jenkins mass function
parameters for the same mass definition as the mass - temperature calibration.
Marginalizing over the 12 uninteresting parameters associated with this method,
we find that the local cluster temperature function implies sigma_8
(Omega_m0/0.32)^alpha = 0.86+/-0.04 with alpha = 0.30 (0.41) for Omega_m0 <
0.32 (Omega_mo > 0.32) (68% confidence for two parameters). This result agrees
with a wide range of recent independent determinations, and we find no evidence
of any additional sources of systematic error for the X-ray cluster temperature
function determination of the matter power spectrum normalization. The joint
WMAP5 + cluster constraints are: Omega_m0 = 0.30+0.03/-0.02 and sigma_8 =
0.85+0.04/-0.02 (68% confidence for two parameters).

simple decoding, we find a means to decipher all such orbits. The dynamics is
complicated by extreme perihelion precession compounded by spin-induced
precession. We are able to quantitatively define and describe the fully three
dimensional motion of comparable mass binaries with one black hole spinning and
expose an underlying simplicity. To do so, we untangle the dynamics by
capturing the motion in the orbital plane. Our results are twofold: (1) We
derive highly simplified equations of motion in a non-orthogonal orbital basis,
and (2) we define a complete taxonomy for fully three-dimensional orbits. More
than just a naming system, the taxonomy provides unambiguous and quantitative
descriptions of the orbits, including a determination of the zoom-whirliness of
any given orbit. Through a correspondence with the rationals, we are able to
show that zoom-whirl behavior is prevalent in comparable mass binaries in the
strong-field regime. A first significant conclusion that can be drawn from this
analysis is that all generic orbits in the final stages of inspiral under
gravitational radiation losses are characterized by precessing clovers with few
leaves and that no orbit will behave like the tightly precessing ellipse of
Mercury. The gravitational waveform produced by these low-leaf clovers will
reflect the natural harmonics of the orbital basis -- harmonics that,
importantly, depend only on radius. The significance for gravitational wave
astronomy will depend on the number of windings the pair executes in the
strong-field regime and could be more conspicuous for intermediate mass pairs

This makes the amplitudes of the evanescent waves around these peaks
inappropriate after transmitted through the imaging structures, and the imaging

problem for such lattices. The objective is to characterize the effective

inside a certain three-dimensional set in the strain space. The flat bottom
occurs because the microscopic discrete model has a large number of deformed
states that carry no forces. We call such deformations still states. In the
paper, we present a complete characterization of the ""flat bottom"" set in terms
of the parameters of the network. This is done by constructing a family of
still states whose average strains densely fill the set in question.

of one-dimensional chains, because the elongations in two-dimensional networks
must satisfy certain compatibility conditions that do not arise in the

In the spin pumping effect, a precessing ferromagnet attached to a normal-metal
acts as a pump of spin-polarized current, giving rise to a spin accumulation.
The resulting spin accumulation induces a backflow of spin current into the
ferromagnet and generates a dc voltage due to the spin dependent conductivities
of the ferromagnet. The magnitude of such voltage is proportional to the
spin-relaxation properties of the normal-metal. By using platinum as a contact
material we observe, in agreement with theory, that the voltage is
significantly reduced as compared to the case when aluminum was used.
Furtheremore, the effects of rectification between the circulating rf currents
and the magnetization precession of the ferromagnet are examined. Most
significantly, we show that using an improved layout device geometry these

through the lattice. Yet, if the frequency is in the upper forbidden band, then
there is a critical driving amplitude for a nonlinear tunneling, which is
called supratransmission, of energy to occur. Here, we discuss mathematically
the mechanism and the source of the supratransmission. By analyzing the
existence and the stability of the rapidly decaying static discrete solitons of
the system, we show rigorously that two of the static solitons emerge and
disappear in a saddle-node bifurcation at a critical driving amplitude. One of
the emerging solitons is always stable in its existence region and the other is
always unstable. We argue that the critical amplitude for supratransmission is
then the same as the critical driving amplitude of the saddle-node bifurcation.
We consider as well the case of the forcing frequency in the lower forbidden

efficient way to transport angular momentum in accretion discs. It has also
been suggested as a way to amplify magnetic fields in discs, the instability
acting as a nonlinear dynamo. Recent numerical work has shown that a
large-scale magnetic field, which is predominantly azimuthal, can be sustained
by motions driven by the MRI of this same field. Following this idea, we
present an analytical calculation of the MRI in the presence of an azimuthal
field with a non-trivial vertical structure. We find that the mean radial EMF
associated to MRI modes tends to reduce the magnetic energy, acting like a
turbulent resistivity by mixing the non-uniform azimuthal field. Meanwhile, the
azimuthal EMF generates a radial field that, in combination with the Keplerian
shear, tends to amplify the azimuthal field and can therefore assist in the
dynamo process. This effect, however, is reversed for sufficiently strong
azimuthal fields, naturally leading to a saturation of the dynamo and possibly
to a cyclic behaviour of the magnetic field, as found in previous numerical
works.

studied using Zipf's law for the city populations and the Gravity law
describing the fluxes of inter-city passenger traffic. Assuming a fixed value
for the cost of transport per person per kilometer we observe that while the
total traffic cost decreases, the total wiring cost increases with the density
of links. As a result the total cost to maintain the traffic distribution is
optimal at a certain link density which vanishes on increasing the network
size. At a finite link density the network is scale-free. Using this model the
air-route network of India has been generated and an one-to-one comparison of
the nodal degree values with the real network has been made.

stellar-gaseous disks evolving in a fully consistent cosmological scenario. We
explored the role of the cosmology on pure stellar disks with different mass
embedded in a cosmological dark matter halo. We deepened such a study by
analysing the impact of different gas fractions and of the star formation
onset.
  We found that in all these cases, the stellar bar arising inside the less
massive disks, i.e., dark matter (DM)-dominated disks, is still living at
redshift zero even if the gas fraction exceeds half of the disk mass. Such a
bar is a genuine product of the cosmology. However, in the most massive disks
there is a threshold value for their gas percentage and lower limit for the
central gas concentration able to destroy the bar when the star formation rate
is switched off. On the other hand in the simulations with star formation the
central mass concentration of gas and of the new stars has a mild action on the
ellipticity of the bar but is not able to destroy it; at z=0 the stellar bar
strength is enhanced by the star formation. Even if our results qualitatively
agree with the classical ones, i.e. with criteria concerning bar instability
derived outside the cosmological framework, the same criteria cannot be
validated for the DM-dominated disks.

flare, a filament eruption, loop expansion, a Moreton wave, and an ejecta were
observed. An EIT wave was detected later on. The main features in the radio
dynamic spectrum were a frequency-drifting continuum and two type II bursts.
Our analysis shows that if the first type II burst was formed in the low
corona, the burst heights and speed are close to the projected distances and
speed of the Moreton wave (a chromospheric shock wave signature). The
frequency-drifting radio continuum, starting above 1 GHz, was formed almost two
minutes prior to any shock features becoming visible, and a fast-expanding
piston (visible as the continuum) could have launched another shock wave. A
possible scenario is that a flare blast overtook the earlier transient, and
ignited the first type II burst. The second type II burst may have been formed
by the same shock, but only if the shock was propagating at a constant speed.
This interpretation also requires that the shock-producing regions were located
at different parts of the propagating structure, or that the shock was passing
through regions with highly different atmospheric densities. This complex
event, with a multitude of radio features and transients at other wavelengths,
presents evidence for both blast-wave-related and CME-related radio emissions.

force. Going beyond the commonly used harmonic bead-spring model, we consider a
nonlinear Morse interaction between the next-nearest-neighbors. We focus
interest on the activation of directed motion instigated by thermal
fluctuations and the localized point force. In this context the local
transition states are identified and the corresponding activation energies are
calculated. As a novel feature it is found that the transport of the chain in
point force direction is determined by stepwise escapes of a single unit or
segments of the chain due to the existence of multiple locally stable
attractors. The non-vanishing net current of the chain is quantitatively
assessed by the value of the mobility of the center of mass. It turns out that
the latter as a function of the ratio of the competing length scales of the
system, that is the period of the substrate potential and the equilibrium
distance between two chain units, shows a resonance behavior. More precisely
there exist a set of optimal parameter values maximizing the mobility.
Interestingly, the phenomenon of negative resistance is found, i.e. the
mobility possesses a minimum at a finite value of the strength of the thermal
fluctuations for a given overcritical external driving force.

the observer affects gravitational lensing. In this paper, a lens equation is
obtained to describe such effects on actual lensing observables. Results can be
easily interpreted in terms of aberration of light-rays. Both radial and
transverse motions with relativistic velocities are considered. The lens
equation is derived by first considering geodesic motion of photons in the
rest-frame Schwarzschild spacetime of the lens, and, then, light-ray detection
in the moving observer's frame. Due to the transverse motion images are
displaced and distorted in the observer's celestial sphere, whereas the radial
velocity along the line of sight causes an effective re-scaling of the lens
mass. The Einstein ring is distorted to an ellipse whereas the caustics in the
source plane are still point-like. Either for null transverse motion or up to
linear order in velocities, the critical curve is still a circle with its
radius corrected by a factor (1+z_d) with respect to the static case, z_d being
the relativistic Doppler shift of the deflector. From the observational point
of view, the orbital motion of the Earth can cause potentially observable
corrections of the order of the microarcsec in lensing towards the
super-massive black hole at the Galactic center. On a cosmological scale,
tangential peculiar velocities of cluster of galaxies bring about a typical
flexion in images of background galaxies in the weak lensing regime but future
measurements seem to be too much challenging.

in the literature, we consider models in which the primordial non-Gaussianity
is measured by the dimensionless non-linearity parameter f_NL, using the
constraints recently obtained from cosmic microwave background data. We predict
the ionized fraction and the optical depth at different cosmological epochs

scale-independent and a scale-dependent f_NL and comparing the results to those
for the standard Gaussian scenario. We find that a positive f_NL enhances the
formation of high-mass haloes at early epochs, when reionization begins, and,
as a consequence, the IGM ionized fraction can grow by a factor up to 5 with
respect to the corresponding Gaussian model. The increase of the filling factor
has a small impact on the reionization optical depth and is of order ~ 10 per
cent if a scale-dependent non-Gaussianity is assumed. Our predictions for
non-Gaussian models are in agreement with the latest WMAP results within the
error bars, but a higher precision is required to constrain the scale

timescale far shorter than the lifetime of the disk. In the absence of
mechanisms that replenish the small dust grain population, protoplanetary disks
would rapidly lose their continuum opacity-bearing dust. This is inconsistent
with infrared observations of disks around T Tauri stars and Herbig Ae/Be
stars, which are usually optically thick at visual wavelengths and show
signatures of small (a<~ 3um) grains. A plausible replenishing mechanism of
small grains is collisional fragmentation or erosion of large dust aggregates,
which model calculations predict to play an important role in protoplanetary
disks. If optically thick disks are to be seen as proof for ongoing
fragmentation or erosion, then alternative explanations for the existence of
optically thick disks must be studied carefully. In this study we explore two
scenarios. First, we study the effect of residual, low-level infall of matter
onto the disk surface. We find that infall rates as low as 10^{-11} Msun/yr
can, in principle, replenish the small grain population to a level that keeps
the disk marginally optically thick. However, it remains to be seen if the
assumption of such inflow is realistic for star+disk systems at the age of
several Myrs, at which winds and jets are expected to have removed any residual
envelope. In summary, fragmentation or erosion still appear to be the most
promising processes to explain the abundant presence of small grains in old
disks.

Bursts (GRBs) are one of the main scientific targets of the AGILE mission and
the MCAL design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuable
all-sky monitor for GRBs. Furthermore MCAL is one of the very few operative
instruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the MeV range. In this
paper the results of GRB detections with MCAL after one year of operation in
space are presented and discussed. A flexible trigger logic implemented in the
AGILE payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of GRBs. For
triggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on a
photon-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by counting
statistics only. When the trigger logic is not active, GRBs can be detected
offline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.

detection rate of about 1 GRB/week, plus several other events at a few
milliseconds timescales. Since February 2008 the on-board trigger logic has

other space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective area
estimations. MCAL also joined the 3rd Inter-Planetary Network, to contribute to

large scales to form protogalaxies, may also be possible to image through
diffuse recombination line emission, possibly even before stars or BHs are
formed. In this article, I discuss the key physical processes that are expected
to have determined the sizes of the first star-clusters and black holes, and
the prospect of studying these objects by direct detections with JWST and with
other instruments. The direct light emitted by the very first stellar clusters
and intermediate-mass black holes at z>10 will likely fall below JWST's
detection threshold. However, JWST could reveal a decline at the faint-end of
the high-redshift luminosity function, and thereby shed light on radiative and
other feedback effects that operate at these early epochs. JWST will also have
the sensitivity to detect individual SNe from beyond z=10. In a dedicated
survey lasting for several weeks, thousands of SNe could be detected at z>6,
with a redshift distribution extending to the formation of the very first stars
at z>15. Using these SNe as tracers may be the only method to map out the
earliest stages of the cosmic star-formation history. Finally, we point out
that studying the earliest objects at high redshift will also offer a new
window on the primordial power spectrum, on 100 times smaller scales than

than fourth in the tournaments in which he participated in year 2000, his best
on the PGA Tour. No other PGA Tour player in our sample could have come close
to such a feat. We also are able to quantify the intimidation factor associated
with playing with Woods. On average, players who were paired with Woods during
the 1998-2001 period scored 0.462 strokes per round worse than normal. Although
we find that Woods' presence in a tournament may have had a small, but
statistically significant adverse impact on the entire field, this effect was
swamped by the apparent intimidation factor associated with having to play with
Tiger side-by-side.
  We also demonstrate that Phil Mickelson's performance in major golf
championships over the 1998-2001 period was not nearly as bad as was frequently
mentioned in the golf press. Although Mickelson won no majors during this
period, he played sufficiently well to have won one or two majors under normal
circumstances. Moreover, his overall performance in majors, relative to his
estimated skill level, was comparable to that of Tiger Woods, who won five of
16 major golf championships during our four-year sample period. Thus, the
general characterization of Woods as golf's dominant player over the 1998-2001

same direction as the lobes observed in the near-infrared images, and a central
compact structure (size ~0"". 25) elongated in the direction perpendicular to
the bipolar axis, coinciding with the equatorial dark lane observed in the
near-infrared images. Our image at 1.3 cm suggests the presence of dense walls
in the ionized bipolar lobes. We estimate for the central compact structure a
value of the electron density at least ~5 times higher than in the lobes. A
high resolution image of this structure at 0.7 cm shows two peaks separated by
about 0"". 13 (corresponding to 100-780 AU, using a distance range of 0.8-6

torus-like structure, from whose edges the water maser emission might be
arising. We have detected weak OH 1612 MHz maser emission at VLSR ~ -70 km/s

have sparked interest in the use of non-orthogonal lattices in lattice QCD.
These fermion actions have the desired chiral symmetry and have the minimal
doubling required by the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem. However, due to the
lack of discrete symmetries, radiative corrections in the gauged lattice theory
will lead to the generation of unwanted relevant and marginal operators. Other
similarly motivated non-orthogonal fermion actions avoid these unwanted
operators, but introduce incorrect continuum behavior or excessive fermion
doubling. A delicate balance of symmetry is required for chiral symmetry,
minimal doubling, and no relevant operators, and to date, no non-orthogonal
lattice action has accomplished this balance.

simulations is proposed, and implementation of a model collision operator
satisfying these properties is described. This operator is based on the exact
linearized test-particle collision operator, with approximations to the
field-particle terms that preserve conservation laws and an H-Theorem. It
includes energy diffusion, pitch-angle scattering, and finite Larmor radius
effects corresponding to classical (real-space) diffusion. The numerical
implementation in the continuum gyrokinetic code GS2 is fully implicit and
guarantees exact satisfaction of conservation properties. Numerical results are
presented showing that the correct physics is captured over the entire range of
collisionalities, from the collisionless to the strongly collisional regimes,
without recourse to artificial dissipation.

models with an anisotropic velocity distribution. The potentialities of the
method have been tested on models with known distribution functions, the
Osipkov-Merritt models. It is shown that models that differ significantly from
the Osipkov-Merritt models can be constructed. An N-body model of a dark halo
with a density distribution that approximates the results of cosmological
simulations (the Navarro--Frenk--White model) has been constructed. The
anisotropy profile has been taken to be similar to that yielded by cosmological
simulations. The constructed models can serve as direct input data for
investigating the dynamics and stability of such systems in N-body simulations.

gas, as traced by the [OI] 6300 AA emission, and the dust, as traced by the 10
micron emission, in the protoplanetary disk around three intermediate-mass
stars: HD 101412, HD 135344 B and HD 179218. N-band visibilities were obtained
with VLTI/MIDI. Simple geometrical models are used to compare the dust emission
to high-resolution optical spectra in the 6300 AA [OI] line of the same
targets. The disks around HD 101412 and HD 135344 B appear strongly flared in
the gas, but self-shadowed in the dust beyond ~ 2 AU. In both systems, the 10
micron emission is rather compact (< 2 AU) while the [OI] brightness profile
shows a double peaked structure. The inner peak is strongest and is consistent
with the location of the dust, the outer peak is fainter and is located at 5-10
AU. Spatially extended PAH emission is found in both disks. The disk around HD
179218 is flared in the dust. The 10 micron emission emerges from a double
ring-like structure with the first ring peaking at ~ 1 AU and the second at ~
20 AU. No dust emission is detected between ~ 3 -- 15 AU. The oxygen emission
seems also to come from a flared structure, however, the bulk of this emission
is produced between ~ 1 -- 10 AU. This could indicate a lack of gas in the
outer disk or could be due to chemical effects which reduce the abundance of OH
-- the parent molecule of the observed [OI] emission -- further away from the
star. The three systems, HD 179218, HD 135344 B and HD 101412, may form an
evolutionary sequence: the disk initially flared becomes flat under the
combined action of gas-dust decoupling, grain growth and dust settling.

algebra heavily depends on the representation of $W$ on the spins. We prove
this by identifying two different symmetry algebras for a $B_L$ spin Calogero
model and three for $G_2$ spin Calogero model. They are all related to the
half-loop algebra and its twisted versions. Some of the result are extended to
any finite Coxeter group.

Tau, a young star with properties that are between those of classical and weak
T Tauri stars and which may be dissipating its circumstellar disk. We find that
the CO line profiles of V836 Tau are unusual in that they are markedly
double-peaked, even after correcting for stellar photospheric absorption in the
spectrum. This suggests that the CO emission arises from a restricted range of
disk radii (< 0.5 AU), in contrast to the situation for most classical T Tauri
stars where the CO emission extends out to much larger radii (~ 1-2 AU). We
discuss whether the outer radius of the emission in V836 Tau results from the
physical truncation of the disk or an excitation effect. We also explore how
either of these hypotheses may bear on our understanding of disk dissipation in
this system.
