As the magnetic field is varied, the ground states mix through a non-Abelian
Berry phase. We show that this Berry phase is the path ordered exponential of
the smooth SU(2) 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. We further show that, by adjusting
a potential on the sphere, the monopole becomes BPS and obeys the Bogomolnyi
equations. For this choice of potential, it turns out that there is a hidden
supersymmetry underlying the system and the Bogomolnyi equations are analogous
to the tt* equations of Cecotti and Vafa. We conjecture that the Bogomolnyi

Chern-Simons theory dual to IIA superstring theory on AdS4 x CP3. Novelty of
Wilson loop operators in this theory is that, for a given contour, there are
two linear combinations of Wilson loop transforming oppositely under
time-reversal transformation. We show that one combination is holographically
dual to IIA fundamental string, while orthogonal combination is set to zero. We
gather supporting evidences from detailed comparative study of generalized
time-reversal transformations in both D2-brane worldvolume and ABJM theories.
We then classify supersymmetric Wilson loops and find at most
1/6-supersymmetry. We next study Wilson loop expectation value in planar
perturbation theory. For circular Wilson loop, we find features remarkably
parallel to circular Wilson loop in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four
dimensions. First, all odd loop diagrams vanish identically and even loops
contribute nontrivial contributions. Second, quantum corrected gauge and scalar
propagators take the same form as those of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
Combining these results, we propose that expectation value of circular Wilson
loop is given by Wilson loop expectation value in pure Chern-Simons theory
times zero-dimensional Gaussian matrix model whose variance is specified by an
interpolating function of `t Hooft coupling. We suggest the function
interpolates smoothly between weak and strong coupling regime, offering new
test ground of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

a new scanning algorithm (MultiNest) which increases the computational
efficiency by a factor ~200 with respect to previously used techniques. We
demonstrate that the currently available data are not yet sufficiently
constraining to allow one to determine the preferred values of CMSSM parameters
in a way that is completely independent of the choice of priors and statistical
measures. While b->s gamma generally favors large m_0, this is in some contrast
with the preference for low values of m_0 and m_1/2 that is almost entirely a
consequence of a combination of prior effects and a single constraint coming
from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which remains somewhat
controversial. Using an information-theoretical measure, we find that the
cosmological dark matter abundance determination provides at least 80% of the
total constraining power of all available observables. Despite the remaining
uncertainties, prospects for direct detection in the CMSSM remain excellent,
with the spin-independent neutralino-proton cross section almost guaranteed
above sigma_SI ~ 10^{-10} pb, independently of the choice of priors or
statistics. Likewise, gluino and lightest Higgs discovery at the LHC remain
highly encouraging. While in this work we have used the CMSSM as particle
physics model, our formalism and scanning technique can be readily applied to a
wider class of models with several free parameters.

reduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to
~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars -- ~8

97% -- more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. The catalog's
completeness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than
70%, with most missing objects occurring at z<0.7 and 2.5<z<3.0. In addition to
classification information, we provide photometric redshift estimates
(typically good to Delta z +/- 0.3 [2 sigma]) and cross-matching with radio,
X-ray, and proper motion catalogs. Finally, we consider the catalog's utility

ideas from the nominal logic by Pitts et al., and demonstrate an implementation
in Isabelle/HOL. The purpose is to derive powerful induction rules for the
semantics in order to conduct machine checkable proofs, closely following the
intuitive arguments found in manual proofs. In this way we have covered many of
the standard theorems of bisimulation equivalence and congruence, both late and
early, and both strong and weak in a uniform manner. We thus provide one of the
most extensive formalisations of a process calculus ever done inside a theorem
prover.
  A significant gain in our formulation is that agents are identified up to
alpha-equivalence, thereby greatly reducing the arguments about bound names.
This is a normal strategy for manual proofs about the pi-calculus, but that
kind of hand waving has previously been difficult to incorporate smoothly in an
interactive theorem prover. We show how the nominal logic formalism and its
support in Isabelle accomplishes this and thus significantly reduces the tedium
of conducting completely formal proofs. This improves on previous work using
weak higher order abstract syntax since we do not need extra assumptions to
filter out exotic terms and can keep all arguments within a familiar
first-order logic.

singlet extended susy higgs model (SESHM) is at best metastable and the ground
states of the model have vanishing vacuum energy and are exactly
supersymmetric. If the SESHM is confirmed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
the numerical values of the parameters of the model have a bearing on key
properties of the susy phase and might provide an estimate of the remaining
time before a possible decay of our false vacuum. We provide some analysis of
the model including a treatment of phases in the potential and soft higgs

UV radiation from its hottest young stars heats and dissociates exposed layers,
but does not ionize hydrogen. Only faint radiation from the Rayleigh-Jeans tail
of ~10-100K dust is expected at wavelengths longwards of 3mm. Yet Cosmic
Background Imager (CBI) observations reveal that the rho Oph W
photo-dissociation region (PDR) is surprisingly bright at centimetre
wavelengths. We searched for interpretations consistent with the WMAP radio
spectrum, new ISO-LWS parallel mode images and archival Spitzer data.
Dust-related emission mechanisms at 1 cm, as proposed by Draine & Lazarian, are
a possibility. But a magnetic enhancement of the grain opacity at 1cm is
inconsistent with the morphology of the dust column maps Nd and the lack of
detected polarization. Spinning dust, or electric-dipole radiation from
spinning very small grains (VSGs), comfortably explains the radio spectrum,
although not the conspicuous absence from the CBI data of the infrared
circumstellar nebulae around the B-type stars S1 and SR~3. Allowing for VSG
depletion can marginally reconcile spinning dust with the data. As an
alternative interpretation we consider the continuum from residual charges in
rho Oph W, where most of carbon should be photoionised by the close binary
HD147889 (B2IV, B3IV). Electron densities of ~100 cm^{-3}, or H-nucleus
densities n_H > 1E6 cm^{-3}, are required to interpret rho Oph W as the CII
Stromgren sphere of HD147889. However the observed steep and positive
low-frequency spectral index would then require optically thick emission from
an hitherto unobserved ensemble of dense clumps or sheets with a filling factor

redshift broad line AGN sample of Greene & Ho (2007), which consists of 8434
objects at z < 0.35 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Fourth Data Release (SDSS
DR4). We obtained radio fluxes from the Very Large Array Faint Images of the
Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey for the SDSS AGN. Out of the
8434 SDSS AGN, 821 have corresponding observed radio fluxes in the FIRST
survey. We calculated the radio-loudness parameter (R) for all objects above
the FIRST detection limit (1 mJy), and an upper limit to R for the undetected
objects. Using these data, the question of radio bimodality is investigated for
different subsets of the total sample. We find no clear demarcation between the
radio-loud (RL, R > 10) and radio-quiet (RQ, R < 10) objects, but instead fill
in a more radio-intermediate population in a continuous fashion for all
subsamples. We find that 4.7% of the AGN in the flux-limited subsample are RL
based on core radio emission alone. We calculate the radio-loud fraction (RLF)
as both a function of black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The RLF decreases
(from 13% to 2%) as Eddington ratio increases over 2.5 order of magnitude. The
RLF is nearly constant (~5%) over 4 decades in black hole mass, except for an
increase at masses greater than 10^8 solar masses. We find for the FIRST
detected subsample that 367 of the RL AGN have black hole masses less than 10^8
solar masses, a large enough number to indicate that RL AGN are not a product
of only the most massive black holes in the local universe.

dynamically broken in infrared-free low-energy theories. We show that, even if
the pseudomoduli potential is generated only at higher loops, there is a regime
where the potential can be simply determined from a combination of one-loop
running data. In this regime, we compute whether the potential for the various
types of pseudomoduli is safe, has a dangerous runaway to the UV cutoff of the
low-energy theory, or is incalculable. Our results are applicable to building
new models of supersymmetry breaking. We apply the results to survey large

significant trends in the physical parameters due to the choice of stellar
evolutionary model and treatment of convective core overshooting. In general,
models that incorporate overshooting presented more reliable results than those
that do not. Comparisons with the results found in the literature demonstrated
that our derived metallicities are in good agreement with the ones from the
spectroscopy of red giants. We also confirmed that, independent of the adopted
stellar evolutionary library, the recovered 3D distribution for these clusters

Brightness extrema coincide with zero-velocity crossings in periodic (3.56 d)

observations of Setiawan et al. (2008) and interpreted as caused by a planet.
The 3.56/3.7 d periodicity was entirely absent in the second, four times longer

approximately constant since the last X-ray observations of the 1980'ies, while
the optical luminosity has decreased. The X-ray properties of this nova are
explained by a high mass white dwarf accreting at low rate, in agreement with
the nova theory given the large amplitude and other characteristics of the 1942

  Assuming a distance of 1600 pc, the X-ray luminosity of CP Pup is L=2.2 x
10(33) erg/s in the 0.15-10 keV range covered with EPIC, compatible with a
magnetic system. The RGS grating spectrum shows a few prominent emission lines,
and it is fitted with a cooling flow with mass accretion rate mdot <= 1.6 x
10(-10) msol/year. We detected also the O VII complex at 21.6-21.8 A that does
not arise in the cooling flow. Most likely this feature originates in a wind or
in the nova shell. The RGS and EPIC spectra are fitted only with thermal models
with a very high shock temperature, T>60 keV, indicating a white dwarf with
M>1.1 M(sun). The X-ray flux is modulated with the spectroscopic period of 1.47
hours detected in the optical. Since CP Pup is not an eclipsing system, this is
better understood if magnetic accretion occurs: we discuss this possibility and
its implications in detail. V351 Pup (N Pup 1991) was detected with XMM-Newton,

orbital separations > 3-10 AU. On the other hand, previous radial velocity
surveys of brown dwarfs are mainly sensitive to separations smaller than 0.6
AU. It has been speculated if the peak of the separation distribution of brown
dwarf binaries lies right in the unprobed range. Very recent work for the first
time extends high-precision radial velocity surveys of brown dwarfs out to 3 AU
(Joergens 2008, A&A). Based on more than six years UVES/VLT spectroscopy the
binary frequency of brown dwarfs and (very) low-mass stars (M4.25-M8) in ChaI
was determined: it is 18% for the whole sample and 10% for the subsample of ten
brown dwarfs and VLMS (M < 0.1 Msun). Two spectroscopic binaries were
confirmed, these are the brown dwarf candidate ChaHa8, and the low-mass star
CHXR74. Since their orbital separations appear to be 1 AU or greater, the
binary frequency at < 1 AU might be less than 10%. Now for the first time
companion searches of (young) brown dwarfs cover the whole orbital separation
range and the following observational constraints for models of brown dwarf
formation can be derived: (i) the frequency of brown dwarf and very low-mass
stellar binaries at < 3 AU is not significantly exceeding that at > 3 AU; i.e.
direct imaging surveys do not miss a significant fraction of brown dwarf
binaries; (ii) the overall binary frequency of brown dwarfs and very low-mass
stars is 10-30 %; (iii) the decline of the separation distribution of brown
dwarfs towards smaller separations seem to occur between 1 and 3 AU; (iv) the
observed continuous decrease of the binary frequency from the stellar to the
substellar regime is confirmed at < 3 AU providing further evidence for a
continuous formation mechanism from low-mass stars to brown dwarfs.

analysis has the advantage that no biases are introduced, either in n_s or in
the related error bar, by the a priori choice of a single angular scale. The
case of continuous, uniformly distributed sources is nominally disfavored at
99% C.L. and the fit improves if the sources follow the large-scale structure
of matter in the universe. The best fit values obtained for the number density
of proton sources are within a factor ~2 around n_s ~ 10^{-4}/Mpc^3 and depend
mainly on the Auger energy calibration scale, with lower densities being
preferred if the current scale is correct. The data show no significant
small-scale clustering on scales smaller than a few degrees. This might be
interpreted as a signature of magnetic smearing of comparable size, comparable
with the indication of a ~3 degrees magnetic deflection coming from
cross-correlation results. The effects on the above results of some

attractive using a magnetic field close to the Feshbach resonance. Liquid 4He
has a monatomic structure with s-wave electrons, zero nuclear spin, no
hyperfine splitting, and as a consequence no Feshbach resonance which would
allow one to change its normally repulsive interactions to be attractive.
Because of this, a Bose-Nova style collapse of 4He is impossible. Additional
speculations concerning cold fusion during these events are easily dismissed
using the usual arguments about the Coulomb barrier at low temperatures, and
are not needed to explain the Bose-Einstein condensate Bose-Nova phenomenon. We
conclude that that there is no physics whatsoever which suggests that Helium

contribute to the inflationary dynamics; the latter are either strictly
massless or have a negligible VEV. In N-flation and generic assisted inflation
scenarios, inflation is a co-operative phenomenon driven by N participator
fields, none of which could drive inflation on their own. We review upper
bounds on N, as a function of the inflationary Hubble scale H. We then consider
stochastic and eternal inflation in models with N participator fields showing
that individual fields may evolve stochastically while the whole ensemble
behaves deterministically, and that a wide range of eternal inflationary
scenarios are possible in this regime. We then compute one-loop quantum
corrections to the inflationary power spectrum. These are largest with N
spectator fields and a single participator field, and the resulting bound on N
is always weaker than those obtained in other ways. We find that loop
corrections to the N-flation power spectrum do not scale with N, and thus place
no upper bound on the number of participator fields. This result also implies
that, at least to leading order, the theory behaves like a composite single
scalar field. In order to perform this calculation, we address a number of
issues associated with loop calculations in the Schwinger-Keldysh ""in-in""

the known number of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way. A
plausible way out of this problem could be that the majority of these sub-halos
somehow have so far evaded detection. If such ""dark galaxies"" do indeed exist,
gravitational lensing may offer one of the most promising ways to detect them.
Dark matter sub-halos in the 1e6 - 1e10 solar mass range should cause strong
gravitational lensing on (sub)milliarcsecond scales. We study the feasibility
of a strong lensing detection of dark sub-halos by deriving the image
separations expected for density profiles favoured by recent simulations and
comparing these to the angular resolution of both existing and upcoming

the present-day Root-Mean-Square (RMS) accuracy in reconstructing the radial
component of the lunar orbit is about 2 cm; its harmonic terms can be
determined at the mm level. The current uncertainty in measuring the lunar
precession rates is about 10^-1 milliarcseconds per year. The Lense-Thirring
secular, i.e. averaged over one orbital period, precessions of the node and the
perigee of the Moon induced by the Earth's spin angular momentum amount to
10^-3 milliarcseconds per year yielding transverse and normal shifts of

orbital perturbations of classical origin like, e.g., the secular precessions
induced by the Sun and the oblateness of the Moon whose mismodelled parts are
several times larger than the Lense-Thirring signal. The present analysis holds

an X-ray-selected sample of 72 clusters from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Here, we
extend this approach to a sample of systems with smaller X-ray fluxes selected
from the 400 Square Degree serendipitous survey of clusters and groups in ROSAT
pointed observations. We identify 16 groups with SDSS DR5 spectroscopy, search
for infall patterns, and compute mass profiles out to 2-6 Mpc from the group
centers with the caustic technique. No other mass estimation methods are
currently available at such large radii for these low-mass groups, because the
virial estimate requires dynamical equilibrium and the gravitational lensing
signal is too weak. Despite the small masses of these groups, most display
recognizable infall patterns. We use caustic and virial mass estimates to
measure the scaling relations between different observables, extending these
relations to smaller fluxes and luminosities than many previous surveys. Close
inspection reveals that three of the groups are subclusters in the outskirts of
larger clusters. A fourth group is apparently undergoing a group-group merger.
These four merging groups represent the most extreme outliers in the scaling
relations. Excluding these groups, we find $L_X\propto\sigma_p^{3.4\pm1.6}$,
consistent with previous determinations for both clusters and groups.
Understanding cluster and group scaling relations is crucial for measuring
cosmological parameters from clusters.

player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly
determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the
safety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the
reachability objective to reach a given set of states. We present in this paper
a strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety
game, that is, the maximal probability with which player~1 can enforce the
safety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which
ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the
safety game.
  Our result is significant because the strategy improvement algorithm
provides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrent
safety game from below. Since a value iteration algorithm, or a strategy
improvement algorithm for reachability games, can be used to approximate the
same value from above, the combination of both algorithms yields a method for
computing a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds for the values of
concurrent reachability and safety games. Previous methods could approximate
the values of these games only from one direction, and as no rates of

a Gillespie--type stochastic simulator, and a molecular dynamics simulator. In

the course of the dimming event we observe the dynamic increase of non-thermal

opens. As the corona begins to close, refill and brighten, we see a reduction
of the non-thermal broadening towards the pre-eruption level. We propose that
the dynamic evolution of non-thermal broadening is the result of the growth of
Alfven wave amplitudes in the magnetically open rarefied dimming region,
compared to the dense closed corona prior to the CME. We suggest, based on this
proposition, that, as open magnetic regions, coronal dimmings must act just as
coronal holes and be sources of the fast solar wind, but only temporarily.
Further, we propose that such a rapid transition in the thermodynamics of the
corona to a solar wind state may have an impulsive effect on the CME that
initiates the observed dimming. This last point, if correct, poses a
significant physical challenge to the sophistication of CME modeling and
capturing the essence of the source region thermodynamics necessary to
correctly ascertain CME propagation speeds, etc.

strategies on the science return of upcoming ground-based experiments aimed at
measuring the B-mode polarization of the CMB. Using simulations of the Clover
experiment, we compare the ability of modulated and un-modulated observations
to recover the signature of gravitational waves in the polarized CMB sky in the
presence of a number of anticipated systematic effects. The general
expectations that fast modulation is helpful in mitigating low-frequency
detector noise, and that the additional redundancy in the projection of the
instrument's polarization sensitivity directions onto the sky when modulating
reduces the impact of instrumental polarization, are borne out by our
simulations. Neither low-frequency polarized atmospheric fluctuations nor
systematic errors in the polarization sensitivity directions are mitigated by
modulation. Additionally, we find no significant reduction in the effect of
pointing errors by modulation. For a Clover-like experiment, pointing jitter
should be negligible but any systematic mis-calibration of the polarization
coordinate reference system results in significant E-B mixing on all angular
scales and will require careful control. We also stress the importance of
combining data from multiple detectors in order to remove the effects of
common-mode systematics (such as 1/f atmospheric noise) on the measured
polarization signal. Finally we compare the performance of our simulated
experiment with the predicted performance from a Fisher analysis. We find good
agreement between the Fisher predictions and the simulations except for the
very largest scales where the power spectrum estimator we have used introduces
additional variance to the B-mode signal recovered from our simulations.

velocity surveys and apply this new method to them. We find that most surveys
we studied are highly consistent with each other. Taken together the data
suggest that the bulk flow within a Gaussian window of radius 50 Mpc/h is 407
km/s toward l=287 and b=8. The large-scale bulk motion is consistent with
predictions from the local density field. This indicates that there are
significant density fluctuations on very large scales. A flow of this amplitude
on such a large scale is not expected in the WMAP5-normalized LCDM cosmology,
for which the predicted one-dimensional r.m.s. velocity is ~110 km/s. The large
amplitude of the observed bulk flow favors the upper values of the WMAP5
error-ellipse, but even the point at the top of the WMAP5 95% confidence
ellipse predicts a bulk flow which is too low compared to that observed at >98%
confidence level.

objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. In the high energy
regime of X- and gamma-rays, outbursts with variability time-scales of seconds
and faster are routinely observed, e.g. in gamma-ray bursts or Soft Gamma
Repeaters. In the optical, flaring activity on such time-scales has never been
observed outside the prompt phase of GRBs. This is mostly due to the fact that
outbursts with strong, fast flaring usually are discovered in the high-energy
regime. Most optical follow-up observations of such transients employ
instruments with integration times exceeding tens of seconds, which are
therefore unable to resolve fast variability. Here we show the observation of
extremely bright and rapid optical flaring in the galactic transient SWIFT
J195509.6+261406. Flaring of this kind has never previously been reported. Our
optical light-curves are phenomenologically similar to high energy light-curves
of Soft Gamma Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars, which are thought to be
neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (magnetars). This suggests
similar emission processes may be at work, but in contrast to the other known
magnetars with strong emission in the optical.

third generation of squarks are light in this scenario and these may be easily
probed besides charginos and neutralinos in the early runs of LHC.

in fluorescence microcopy by activating and localizing subsets of the
fluorescent molecules in the specimen, and repeating this process until all of
the molecules have been imaged. In these techniques there is a tradeoff between
speed (activating more molecules per imaging cycle) and error rates (activating
more molecules risks producing overlapping images that hide information on
molecular positions), and so intelligent image-processing approaches are needed
to identify and reject overlapping images. We introduce here a formalism for
defining error rates, derive a general relationship between error rates, image
acquisition rates, and the performance characteristics of the image processing
algorithms, and show that there is a minimum acquisition time irrespective of
algorithm performance. We also consider algorithms that can infer molecular
positions from images of overlapping blurs, and derive the dependence of the
minimimum acquisition time on algorithm performance.

satisfies the Prigogine's extended second law of thermodynamics,
$\partial_tS\geq 0$ (for any nonisolated multi-component system). Qualitative
similarities and superpositions between individual and crowd configuration
manifolds motivate our claim that goal-directed crowd movement operates under
entropy conservation, $\partial_tS = 0$, while natural crowd dynamics operates
under (monotonically) increasing entropy function, $\partial_tS > 0$. Between
these two distinct topological phases lies a phase transition with a chaotic
inter-phase. Both inertial crowd dynamics and its dissipative kinematics
represent diffusion processes on the crowd manifold governed by the Ricci flow,

level. When discretized at sub-atomic distances, the volume is inherently
sparse. Noiseless measurements from an imaging technology can be modeled by
convolution of the image with the system point spread function (psf). Such is
the case with magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), an emerging
technology where imaging of an individual tobacco mosaic virus was recently
demonstrated with nanometer resolution. We also consider additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in the measurements. Many prior works of sparse
estimators have focused on the case when H has low coherence; however, the
system matrix H in our application is the convolution matrix for the system
psf. A typical convolution matrix has high coherence. The paper therefore does
not assume a low coherence H. A discrete-continuous form of the Laplacian and
atom at zero (LAZE) p.d.f. used by Johnstone and Silverman is formulated, and
two sparse estimators derived by maximizing the joint p.d.f. of the observation
and image conditioned on the hyperparameters. A thresholding rule that
generalizes the hard and soft thresholding rule appears in the course of the
derivation. This so-called hybrid thresholding rule, when used in the iterative
thresholding framework, gives rise to the hybrid estimator, a generalization of
the lasso. Unbiased estimates of the hyperparameters for the lasso and hybrid
estimator are obtained via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). A numerical
study with a Gaussian psf and two sparse images shows that the hybrid estimator
outperforms the lasso.

measured to be 1,000 times weaker than that of the strongest transition in the

dominance of the hyperfine interaction over the fine structure interaction. An
alternative selection rule based on \textit{IS}-coupling (where the nuclear

qualitative understanding of the transition strengths. It is shown that the

broadcast channel (BC), associated optimization problems such as capacity
region computation and beamforming optimization are typically non-convex, and
cannot be solved directly. One feasible approach to these problems is to
transform them into their dual multiple access channel (MAC) problems, which
are easier to deal with due to their convexity properties. The conventional
BC-MAC duality is established via BC-MAC signal transformation, and has been
successfully applied to solve beamforming optimization,
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing, and capacity region
computation. However, this conventional duality approach is applicable only to
the case, in which the base station (BS) of the BC is subject to a single sum
power constraint. An alternative approach is minimax duality, established by Yu
in the framework of Lagrange duality, which can be applied to solve the
per-antenna power constraint problem. This paper extends the conventional
BC-MAC duality to the general linear constraint case, and thereby establishes a
general BC-MAC duality. This new duality is applied to solve the capacity
computation and beamforming optimization for the MIMO and multiple-input
single-output (MISO) BC, respectively, with multiple linear constraints.
Moreover, the relationship between this new general BC-MAC duality and minimax
duality is also presented. It is shown that the general BC-MAC duality offers
more flexibility in solving BC optimization problems relative to minimax
duality. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.

studied mathematically of a standard model in physics, where the
electromagnetic potential is assumed to be periodic with respect to a large box
and quantized thorough its Fourier coefficients. In physics, the Feynman path
integral for nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is defined very formally.
For example, as is often seen, even independent variables are not so clear.
First, the Feynman path integral is defined rigorously under the constraints
familiar in physics. Secondly, the Feynman path integral is also defined
rigorously without the constraints, which is stated in Feynman and Hibbs' book
without any comments. So, our definition may be completely new. Thirdly, the
vacuum and the state of photons of momentums and polarization states are
expressed by means of concrete functions of variables consisting of the Fourier
coefficients of the electromagnetic potential. Our results above have many
applications as is seen in Feynman and Hibbs' book, though the applications are
not rigorous so far. It is also proved rigorously by means of the distribution
theory that the Coulomb potentials between charged particles naturally appear
in the Feynman path integral above. As is well known, this shows that photons
give the Coulomb forth.

theory the positions of images by gravitational lensing due to arbitrary number
of coplanar masses without any symmetry on a plane, as a function of lens and
source parameters. We present a method of Taylor-series expansion to solve the
lens equation under a small mass-ratio approximation. First, we investigate
perturbative structures of a single-complex-variable polynomial, which has been
commonly used. Perturbative roots are found. Some roots represent positions of
lensed images, while the others are unphysical because they do not satisfy the
lens equation. This is consistent with a fact that the degree of the
polynomial, namely the number of zeros, exceeds the maximum number of lensed
images if N=3 (or more). The theorem never tells which roots are physical (or
unphysical). In this paper, unphysical ones are identified. Secondly, to avoid
unphysical roots, we re-examine the lens equation. The advantage of our method
is that it allows a systematic iterative analysis. We determine image positions
for binary lens systems up to the third order in mass ratios and for arbitrary
N point masses up to the second order. This clarifies the dependence on
parameters. Thirdly, the number of the images that admit a small mass-ratio
limit is less than the maximum number. It is suggested that positions of extra
images could not be expressed as Maclaurin series in mass ratios.
Magnifications are finally discussed.

source at the position of 2MASS J05352184-0546085, whereas the XMM-Newton data
suffer from contamination from other nearby sources, but are consistent with
the Chandra detection. No indications of flaring activity are found in either
of the observations (together about 70 ks), and we thus attribute the observed
flux to quiescent emission. With an X-ray luminosity of 3*10^{28} erg/s we find
an L_X/L_{bol}-ratio close to the saturation limit of 10^{-3} and an

function in the 3d states. The former factor is calculated using the $4p$
density of states given by an ab initio band structure calculation and the
latter using the wavefunctions given by a Hartree-Fock calculation of a
multi-orbital tight-binding model. The initial state is described within the
Hartree-Fock approximation and the electron correlations on charge excitations
are treated within the random phase approximation. The calculated RIXS spectra
well reproduce several characteristic features in the experiments. Although
several groups have interpreted the RIXS peaks as bound excitons, our
calculation indicates that they should be interpreted as band-to-band
excitations augmented by electron correlations. The difference in RIXS spectra
between La2CuO4 and La2NiO4 is explained from this point of view.

  Likelihood Decoding",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, network error control coding is studied for robust and
efficient multicast in a directed acyclic network with imperfect links. The
block network error control coding framework, BNEC, is presented and the
capability of the scheme to correct a mixture of symbol errors and packet
erasures and to detect symbol errors is studied. The idea of syndrome-based
decoding and error detection is introduced for BNEC, which removes the effect
of input data and hence decreases the complexity. Next, an efficient
three-stage syndrome-based BNEC decoding scheme for network error correction is
proposed, in which prior to finding the error values, the position of the edge
errors are identified based on the error spaces at the receivers. In addition
to bounded-distance decoding schemes for error correction up to the refined
Singleton bound, a complete decoding scheme for BNEC is also introduced.
Specifically, it is shown that using the proposed syndrome-based complete
decoding, a network error correcting code with redundancy order d for receiver
t, can correct d-1 random additive errors with a probability sufficiently close
to 1, if the field size is sufficiently large. Also, a complete maximum
likelihood decoding scheme for BNEC is proposed. As the probability of error in
different network edges is not equal in general, and given the equivalency of
certain edge errors within the network at a particular receiver, the number of
edge errors, assessed in the refined Singleton bound, is not a sufficient
statistic for ML decoding.

planets. The VLA image shows a compact feature in the disc at 65 AU radius

localised surface density enhancement representing a candidate proto-planet in
its earliest accretion phase. If correct, this is the first image of a low-mass

environment for covariant quantization of a Lagrangian field theory. Indeed, it
is manifestly covariant and possesses a canonical (functional) ""presymplectic

(functional) distribution is naturally interpreted as the Lie algebra of gauge
transformations. We propose a fully rigorous approach to the covariant phase

detected in the center and along the bar of NGC2903. The line ratio
HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) ranges from 0.07 to 0.12 with the lowest value in the center.
The enhancement of HCN(1-0) emission along the bar indicates a higher fraction
of dense molecular gas in the bar than at the center. The mass of dense
molecular gas in the center (2.2x 10^7 Msun) is about 6 times lower than that
in the bar (1.2x 10^8 Msun). The total star formation rate (SFR) is estimated
to be 1.4 Msun/yr, where the SFR at the center is 1.9 times higher than that in
the bar. The time scale of consumption of the dense molecular gas in the center
is about 3x 10^7 yr which is much shorter than that in the bar of about 2 to 10
x 10^8 yr. The dynamical time scale of inflow of the gas from the bar to the
center is shorter than the consumption time scale in the bar, which suggests
that the star formation (SF) activity at the center is not deprived of fuel. In
the bar, the fraction of dense molecular gas mass relative to the total
molecular gas mass is twice as high along the leading edge than along the
central axis of the bar. The \hcn emission has a large velocity dispersion in
the bar, which can be attributed partially to the streaming motions indicative
of shocks along the bar. In NGC3504, the HCN(2-0) emission is detected only at
the center. The fraction of dense molecular gas mass in the center is about
15%. Comparison of the SFR with the predictions from numerical simulations
suggest that NGC2903 harbors a young type B bar with a strong inflow of gas
toward the center whereas NGC3504 has an older bar and has already passed the
phase of inflow of gas toward the center.

either a.s. there is an infinite open cluster or a.s. there is an infinite

transition being sharp: below $p_c$, the size of the open cluster of a given

tail. The analog of this result has been proven by Higuchi in 1993 for
two-dimensional Ising percolation (at fixed inverse temperature

sharp-threshold results (approximate zero-one laws) and a modification of an

interacting via hard interactions are considered, and the stability of the two
nematic phases (uniaxial and tetratic) is examined using an extended
scaled--particle theory applied to a polydispersed fluid mixture of $n$
species. Here the $i$--th species is associated with clusters of $i$
rectangles, with clusters defined as stacks of rectangles containing
approximately parallel rectangles, with frozen internal degrees of freedom. The
theory assumes an exponential cluster size distribution (an assumption fully
supported by Monte Carlo simulations and by a simple chemical--reaction model),
with fixed value of the second moment. The corresponding area distribution
presents a shoulder, and sometimes even a well-defined peak, at cluster sizes
approximately corresponding to square shape (i.e. $i\simeq\kappa$), meaning
that square clusters have a dominant contribution to the free energy of the
hard--rectangle fluid. The theory predicts an enhanced region of stability of
the tetratic phase with respect to the standard scaled--particle theory, much
closer to simulation and to experimental results, demonstrating the importance
of clustering in this fluid.

variations of a population (e.g. biological species or industrial goods) a few
variations get selected which survive and proliferate, whereas the others
vanish. Survival probability is typically associated with the 'fitness' of a
particular variation. In this paper we argue that the notion of fitness is an a
posteriori concept, in the sense that one can assign higher fitness to species
that survive but one can generally not derive or even measure fitness - or
fitness landscapes - per se. For this reason we think that in a 'physical'
theory of evolution such notions should be avoided. In this spirit, here we
propose a random matrix model of evolution where selection mechanisms are
encoded in the interaction matrices of species. We are able to recover some key
facts of evolution dynamics, such as punctuated equilibrium, i.e. the existence
of intrinsic large extinctions events, and, at the same time, periods of
dramatic diversification, as known e.g. from fossil records. Further, we
comment on two fundamental technical problems of a 'physics of evolution', the
non-closedness of its phase space and the problem of co-evolving boundary
conditions, apparent in all systems subject to evolution.

  Detectors using White Light Cavities","19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been observed indirectly, by
monitoring the change in the orbital frequency of neutron stars in a binary
system as they lose energy via gravitational radiation. However, GWs have not
yet been observed directly. The initial LIGO apparatus has not yet observed
GWs. The Advanced LIGO (AdLIGO) will use a combination of improved techniques
in order to increase the sensitivity. Along with power recycling and a higher
power laser source, the AdLIGO will employ signal recycling (SR). While SR
would increase sensitivity, it would also reduce the bandwidth significantly.
Previously, we and others have investigated, theoretically and experimentally,
the feasibility of using a White Light Cavity (WLC) to circumvent this
constraint. However, in the previous work, it was not clear how one would
incorporate the white light cavity effect. Here, we first develop a general
model for Michelson-Interferometer based GW detectors that can be easily
adapted to include the effects of incorporating a WLC into the design. We then
describe a concrete design of a WLC constructed as a compound mirror, to
replace the signal recycling mirror. This design is simple, robust, completely
non-invasive, and can be added to the AdLIGO system without changing any other
optical elements. We show a choice of parameters for which the signal
sensitivity as well as the bandwidth are enhanced significantly over what is
planned for the AdLIGO, covering the entire spectrum of interest for
gravitational waves.

Dirac-like energy dispersion, but also from the chiral nature of its

semiclassical Boltzmann approach. In this paper we provide a quantum derivation
of the transport scattering time in graphene in the case of electron-phonon
interaction. By using the Kubo formalism, we compute explicitly the vertex
corrections to the dc conductivity by retaining the full chiral matrix
structure of graphene. We show that at least in the regime of large chemical
potential the Boltzmann picture is justified, and it is also robust against a
small sublattice inequivalence which partly spoils the role of chirality.

present analytical results for the group velocity components of an electron
flux through chiral carbon nanotubes. Chiral currents are shown to exhibit a
rich behaviour and can even change sign and oscillate as the energy of the
electrons is increased. We find that the transverse velocity and associated
angular momentum of electrons is a maximum for non-metallic CNTs with a chiral
angle of 18$^o$. Such CNTs are therefore the optimal choice for CNT windmills
and also generate the largest internal magnetic field for a given longitudinal
current. For a longitudinal current of order $10^{-4}$ amps, this field can be
of order $10^{-1}$Teslas, which is sufficient to produce interesting spintronic
effects and a significant contribution to the self inductance.

accessible information on multiple parton collisions consists in the
probability distribution of the elementary interactions, while the inclusive
cross sections, usually considered in large p_t processes, acquire a precise
statistical meaning as moments of the multiplicity distribution. Conversely
different and more ""exclusive"" cross sections become experimentally viable,
providing complementary information on the interaction dynamics. The matter is

It is parameterized by its energy and its lifetime. A numerical discretization
technique, the mapped Fourier grid method (MFG) is extended to the Dirac
equation and is used to solve for the resonance parameters of a quasimolecular
supercritical 1S$\sigma$ state which arises, e.g., in a uranium-uranium
collision. Direct methods using only the MFG method are shown to give
reasonable estimates for the resonance parameters. Analytic continuation
methods such as complex scaling (CS) of the coordinate or adding a complex
absorbing potential (CAP) are then applied. They allow for more accurate
determinations of the supercritical resonance parameters. The (extrapolated)
augmented analytic continuation methods are used to investigate the effects of
higher-order couplings, beyond the monopole approximation. For the nearly
charge symmetric system of U$^{92+}$-Cf$^{98+}$, it is shown that the S-D
quadrupole coupling is the next dominant interaction after the monopole
interaction. Collisions near the Coulomb barrier, in which supercritical
resonance states occur, are also calculated using the MFG. Results are
presented for the collision of U$^{92+}$-U$^{92+}$ for a zero-impact-parameter
Coulomb trajectory at a center-of-mass energy of 740MeV. The enhancement
effects to the positron spectrum due to nuclear sticking at closest approach is
examined. Results are given for sticking times of 2,5,10$\times10^{-21}$s.
Nuclear sticking is shown to offer the possibility of demonstrating
experimentally the existence of supercritical resonance states.
