Serpens, and Ophiuchus, assembled by combining large-scale 1.1 mm Bolocam
continuum and Spitzer Legacy surveys. We identify protostellar candidates based
on their mid-infrared properties, correlate their positions with 1.1 mm core
positions, and construct well-sampled SEDs using our extensive wavelength
coverage (lam=1.25-1100 micron). Source classification based on the bolometric
temperature yields a total of 39 Class 0 and 89 Class I sources in the three
cloud sample. We compare to protostellar evolutionary models using the
bolometric temperature-luminosity diagram, finding a population of low
luminosity Class I sources that are inconsistent with constant or monotonically
decreasing mass accretion rates. This result argues strongly for episodic
accretion during the Class I phase, with more than 50% of sources in a
``sub-Shu'' (dM/dt < 1e-6 Msun/yr) accretion state. Average spectra are
compared to protostellar radiative transfer models, which match the observed
spectra fairly well in Stage 0, but predict too much near-IR and too little
mid-IR flux in Stage I. Finally, the relative number of Class 0 and Class I
sources are used to estimate the lifetime of the Class 0 phase; the three cloud
average yields a Class 0 lifetime of 1.7e5 yr, ruling out an extremely rapid
early accretion phase. Correcting photometry for extinction results in a
somewhat shorter lifetime (1.1e5 yr). In Ophiuchus, however, we find very few
Class 0 sources (N(Class0)/N(ClassI)=0.1-0.2), similar to previous studies of
that cloud. The observations suggest a consistent picture of nearly constant
average accretion rate through the entire embedded phase, with accretion
becoming episodic by at least the Class I stage, and possibly earlier.

accretion-powered millisecond pulsars can be understood if their X-ray emitting
areas are near their spin axes and move as the accretion rate and structure of
the inner disk vary. Here we show that this ""nearly aligned moving spot model""
may also explain the intermittent accretion-powered pulsations that have been
detected in three weakly magnetic accreting neutron stars. We show that
movement of the emitting area from very close to the spin axis to about 10
degrees away can increase the fractional rms amplitude from less than about 0.5
percent, which is usually undetectable with current instruments, to a few
percent, which is easily detectable. The second harmonic of the spin frequency
usually would not be detected, in agreement with observations. The model
produces intermittently detectable oscillations for a range of emitting area
sizes and beaming patterns, stellar masses and radii, and viewing directions.
Intermittent oscillations are more likely in stars that are more compact. In
addition to explaining the sudden appearance of accretion-powered millisecond
oscillations in some neutron stars with millisecond spin periods, the model
explains why accretion-powered millisecond oscillations are relatively rare and
predicts that the persistent accretion-powered millisecond oscillations of
other stars may become undetectable for brief intervals. It suggests why
millisecond oscillations are frequently detected during the X-ray bursts of
some neutron stars but not others and suggests mechanisms that could explain
the occasional temporal association of intermittent accretion-powered
oscillations with thermonuclear X-ray bursts.

three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theory dual to quantum superstrings in
AdS_4 x CP^3 was proposed. It initially passed a few consistency checks but
subsequent direct comparison to one-loop string-theory computations created
some controversy. Here we suggest a resolution by pointing out that, contrary
to the initial assumption based on the algebraic curve considerations, the
central interpolating function h(\lambda) entering the BMN or magnon dispersion

computational scheme. We consider a basic example which has already played a
key role in the AdS_5 x S^5 case: a rigid circular string stretched in both
AdS_4 and along an S^1 of CP^3 and carrying two spins. Computing the leading
one-loop quantum correction to its energy allows us to fix the constant
one-loop term in h(\lambda) and also to suggest how one may establish a
correspondence with the Bethe Ansatz proposal, including the non-trivial
one-loop phase factor. We discuss some problems which remain in trying to match
a part of world-sheet contributions (sensitive to compactness of the string
direction) and their Bethe Ansatz counterparts.

by the use of MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) radar systems, configured
with multiple transmit and receive sensors, widely distributed over a given
area. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target localization accuracy is
developed for both coherent and non-coherent processing. Coherent processing
requires a common phase reference for all transmit and receive sensors. The
CRLB is shown to be inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth in
the non-coherent case, but is approximately inversely proportional to the
carrier frequency in the coherent case. We further prove that optimization over
the sensors' positions lowers the CRLB by a factor equal to the product of the
number of transmitting and receiving sensors. The best linear unbiased
estimator (BLUE) is derived for the MIMO target localization problem. The
BLUE's utility is in providing a closed form localization estimate that
facilitates the analysis of the relations between sensors locations, target
location, and localization accuracy. Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP)
contours are used to map the relative performance accuracy for a given layout

The large scale
environment is classified into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and
knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor,
i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential, on a grid. The classification
is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold,
lambda_th at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such
eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The
collection of neighboring grid points, friends-of-friends, of the same web
attribute constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as web objects.
  A simple dynamical consideration suggests that lambda_th should be
approximately unity, upon an appropriate scaling of the deformation tensor. The
algorithm has been applied and tested against a suite of (dark matter only)
cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume
and mass filling fractions on lambda_th and on the resolution has been
calculated for the four web types. Also, the percolation properties of voids
and filaments have been studied.
  Our main findings are: (a) Already at lambda_th = 0.1 the resulting web
classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (b) Between
0.2 < lambda_th < 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of
interconected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for lambda_th as the
parameter that defines the cosmic web. (c) The dynamical nature of the
suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating
environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular the
semi-analytical ones.

cylindrical loops using the T-matrix theory. Loops that have similar kink
frequencies oscillate collectively with a frequency which is slightly different
from that of the individual kink mode. On the other hand, if the kink frequency
of a loop is different from that of the others, it oscillates individually with
its own frequency. Since the individual kink frequency depends on the loop
density but not on its radius for typical 1 MK coronal loops, a coupling
between kink oscillations of neighboring loops take place when they have
similar densities. The relevance of these results in the interpretation of the
oscillations studied by \citet{schrijver2000} and \citet{verwichte2004}, in
which transverse collective loop oscillations seem to be detected, is
discussed. In the first case, two loops oscillating in antiphase are observed;
interpreting this motion as a collective kink mode suggests that their
densities are roughly equal. In the second case, there are almost three groups
of tubes that oscillate with similar periods and therefore their dynamics can
be collective, which again seems to indicate that the loops of each group share
a similar density. All the other loops seem to oscillate individually and their
densities can be different from the rest.

are thought to be produced by magnetars, young neutron stars with very strong
magnetic fields of the order of 10^(14-15) G. Only three such objects are known
in our Galaxy, and a fourth one is associated with the supernova remnant N49 in
the Large Magellanic Cloud. In none of these cases has an optical counterpart
to either the gamma-ray flares or the quiescent source been identified. Here we
present multi-wavelength observations of a puzzling source, SWIFT
J195509+261406, for which we detected more than 40 flaring episodes in the
optical band over a time span of 3 days, plus a faint infrared flare 11 days
later, after which it returned to quiescence. We propose that SWIFT
J195509+261406 is a member of a subgroup of SGRs for which the long-term X-ray
emission is transient in nature. Furthermore, it is the first SGR for which
bursts have been detected in the optical and near-infrared bands and maybe the
link between the ""persistent"" SGRs and the dim isolated neutron stars.

derived on the basis of common features in their electronic structures
including quasi-two-dimensionality, and the large-U nature of the electron
orbitals close to E_F (smaller-U hybridized orbitals reside at bonding and
antibonding states away from E_F). Consequently, low-energy excitations are
described in terms of auxiliary particles, representing combinations of
atomic-like electron configurations, rather than electron-like quasiparticles.
The introduction of a Lagrange Bose field is necessary to enable the treatments
of these auxiliary particles as bosons or fermions. The condensation of the
bosons results in static or dynamical inhomogeneities, and consequently in a
commensurate or an incommensurate resonance mode. The dynamics of the fermions
determines the charge transport, and their strong coupling to the
Lagrange-field bosons results in pairing and superconductivity. The calculated
resonance mode in hole-doped cuprates agrees with the experimental results, and
is shown to be correlated with the pairing gap on the Fermi arcs.

ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model, in both the first-order and second-order phase
transition regimes of the pure model. Phase transition temperatures, thermal
and magnetic critical exponents are determined for lattice sizes in the range
L=20-100 via a sophisticated two-stage numerical strategy of entropic sampling
in dominant energy subspaces, using mainly the Wang-Landau algorithm. The
second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the
second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical
exponents as the 2d Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond
disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic
corrections, our findings thus supporting the marginal irrelevance of quenched
bond randomness. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under
bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a
distinctive universality class with \nu=1.30(6) and \beta/\nu=0.128(5). This
amounts to a strong violation of the universality principle of critical
phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of
critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.
Furthermore, the latter of these two transitions supports an extensive but weak
universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different
thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional systems. In the
conversion by bond randomness of the first-order transition of the pure system
to second order, we detect, by introducing and evaluating connectivity spin
densities, a microsegregation that also explains the increase we find in the
phase transition temperature under bond randomness.

manganese abundances for 95 dwarf stars in two distinct and well defined
stellar populations - the Galactic thin and thick disks. As these two
populations have different chemical histories we have been able to, through a
differential abundance analysis using high-resolution spectra, constrain the
formation sites for carbon and manganese in the Galactic disk(s).
  The analysis of carbon is based on the forbidden [C I] line at 872.7 nm which
is an abundance indicator that is insensitive to errors in the stellar
atmosphere parameters. Combining these data with our previously published
oxygen abundances, based on the forbidden [O I] line at 630.0 nm, we can form
very robust [C/O] ratios that we then used to investigate the origin of carbon
and the chemical evolution of the Galactic thin and thick disks..... Our
interpretation of our abundance trends is that the sources that are responsible
for the carbon enrichment in the Galactic thin and thick disks have operated on
a time-scale very similar to those that are responsible for the Fe and Y
enrichment (i.e., SNIa and AGB stars, respectively).
  For manganese, when comparing our Mn abundances with O abundances for the
same stars we find that the abundance trends in the stars with kinematics
typical of the thick disk can be explained by metallicity dependent yields from
SN II. Furthermore, the [Mn/O] versus [O/H] trend in the halo is flat. We
conclude that the simplest interpretation of our data is that manganese most
likely is produced in SN II and that the Mn yields for such SNae must be
metallicity dependent.

be F- or G-type absorption features are detectable in its optical region under
the very complex emission line spectrum; their radial velocity agrees with the
CO velocity of the larger cloud in which IC 2144 is embedded. There are
significant differences between the spectrum of the brightest area of the

detail. The distance of IC 2144 is inferred to be about 1.0 kpc by reference to
other star-forming regions in the vicinity. The extinction is large, as
demonstrated by [Fe II] emission line ratios in the near-IR and by the strength
of the diffuse interstellar band spectrum; a provisional value of A_V of 3.0
mag was assumed. The SED of MWC 778 rises steeply beyond about 1 $\mu$m, with a
slope characteristic of a Class I source. Integration of the flux distribution
leads to an IR luminosity of about 510 L_solar. If MWC 778 is indeed a F- or

large to remove the remnant BH from a low-mass galaxy but is below the escape
velocity from the Milky Way (MW) galaxy. If central BHs were common in the
galactic building blocks that merged to make the MW, then numerous BHs that
were kicked out of low-mass galaxies should be freely floating in the MW halo
today. We use a large statistical sample of possible merger tree histories for
the MW to estimate the expected number of recoiled BH remnants present in the
MW halo today. We find that hundreds of BHs should remain bound to the MW halo
after leaving their parent low-mass galaxies. Each BH carries a compact cluster
of old stars that populated the core of its original host galaxy. Using the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation, we find that present-day clusters are ~<
1 pc in size, and their central bright regions should be unresolved in most
existing sky surveys. These compact systems are distinguishable from globular
clusters by their internal (Keplerian) velocity dispersion greater than one
hundred km/s and their high mass-to-light ratio owing to the central BH. An
observational discovery of this relic population of star clusters in the MW
halo, would constrain the formation history of the MW and the dynamics of BH

implications for their interaction history with the Milky Way (MW) and with
each other. The Clouds are likely on their first passage about the MW and the
SMC's orbit about the LMC is better described as quasi-periodic rather than
circular. Binary L/SMC orbits that satisfy observational constraints on their
mutual interaction history (e.g. the formation of the Magellanic Bridge during
a collision between the Clouds ~300 Myr ago) can be located within 1 sigma of
the mean PMs. However, these binary orbits are not co-located with the
Magellanic Stream (MS) when projected on the plane of the sky and the
line-of-sight velocity gradient along the LMC's orbit is significantly steeper
than that along the MS. These combined results ultimately rule out a purely
tidal origin for the MS: tides are ineffective without multiple pericentric
passages and can neither decrease the velocity gradient nor explain the offset
stream in a polar orbit configuration. Alternatively, ram pressure stripping of
an extended gaseous disk may naturally explain the deviation. The offset also
suggests that observations of the little-explored region between RA 21h and 23h
are crucial for characterizing the full extent of the MS.

traces, as well as HI gas. The LMC is a rotating disk for which the viewing
angles have been well-established using various methods. The disk is elliptical
in its disk plane. The disk thickness varies depending on the tracer
population, with V/sigma ranging from 2-10 from the oldest to the youngest

distribution with considerable line-of-sight depth and low V/sigma. Young stars

the kinematics indicate that each Cloud is embedded in a dark halo. Proper
motion measurements with HST show that both galaxies move significantly more
rapidly around the Milky Way than previously believed. This indicates that for
a canonical 10^12 solar mass Milky Way the Clouds are only passing by us for
the first time. Although a higher Milky Way mass yields a bound orbit, this
orbit is still very different from what has been previously assumed in models
of the Magellanic Stream. Hence, much of our understanding of the history of

so called \emph{topological color codes} defined on a two-dimensional lattice

the entanglement of different bipartitions of the 2-colex. The dependency of
the ground state degeneracy on the genus of the surface shows that the color
code can support a topological order, and the contribution of the color in its
structure makes it interesting to compare with the Kitaev's toric code. While a
qubit is maximally entangled with rest of the system, two qubits are no longer
entangled showing that the color code is genuinely multipartite entangled. For
a convex region, it is found that entanglement entropy depends only on the
degrees of freedom living on the boundary of two subsystems. The boundary
scaling of entropy is supplemented with a topological subleading term which for
a color code defined on a compact surface is twice than the toric code. From
the entanglement entropy we construct a set of bipartitions in which the
diverging term arising from the boundary term is washed out, and the remaining
non-vanishing term will have a topological nature. Besides the color code on
the compact surface, we also analyze the entanglement properties of a version

is metastable, the lifetime of atoms in this level is relatively long, which
may cause the 2s state to be overpopulated relative to the 2p state. It has
recently been proposed that for this reason, neutral intergalactic atomic
hydrogen gas may be detected in absorption in its 3-cm fine-structure line
(2s_1/2 -> 2p_3/2) against the Cosmic Microwave Background out to very high
redshifts. In particular, the optical depth in the fine-structure line through
neutral intergalactic gas surrounding bright quasars during the EoR may reach
tau~1e-5. The resulting surface brightness temperature of tens of micro K (in
absorption) may be detectable with existing radio telescopes. Motivated by this
exciting proposal, we perform a detailed analysis of the transfer of Lyman
beta,gamma,delta,... radiation, and re-analyze the detectability of the
fine-structure line in neutral intergalactic gas surrounding high-redshift
quasars. We find that proper radiative transfer modeling causes the
fine-structure absorption signature to be reduced tremendously to tau< 1e-10.
We therefore conclude that neutral intergalactic gas during the EoR cannot
reveal its presence in the 3-cm fine-structure line to existing radio
telescopes.

pulsations with a relatively low amplitude (i.e., an intrinsic pulsed-fraction

to different ions can be addressed individually. In the first part of the paper
we show that, if local control of the radial trapping frequencies is available,
any linear optical and squeezing operation on the locally defined modes - on

degrees of bipartite and multipartite continuous variable entanglement under
realistic noisy working conditions, and even restricting only to a global
control of the trapping frequencies. Furthermore, we consider the transmission
of the quantum information encoded in the radial modes along the array of ions,

finite-dimensional and continuous variable quantum states. Finally, as an
application, we show that the states which can be generated in this setting
allow for the violation of multipartite non-locality tests, by feasible

correlated electron system with the surrounding conduction electrons of a
non-magnetic host. Spin S=1/2 Kondo systems have been investigated extensively
in theory and experiments, but magnetic atoms often have a larger spin. Larger
spins are subject to the influence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which
describes the dependence of the magnetic moment's energy on the orientation of
the spin relative to its surrounding atomic environment. Here we demonstrate
the decisive role of magnetic anisotropy in the physics of Kondo screening. A
scanning tunnelling microscope is used to simultaneously determine the
magnitude of the spin, the magnetic anisotropy and the Kondo properties of
individual magnetic atoms on a surface. We find that a Kondo resonance emerges
for large-spin atoms only when the magnetic anisotropy creates degenerate
ground-state levels that are connected by the spin flip of a screening
electron. The magnetic anisotropy also determines how the Kondo resonance
evolves in a magnetic field: the resonance peak splits at rates that are
strongly direction dependent. These rates are well described by the energies of
the underlying unscreened spin states.

the neocortex, can embed reliable robust finite state machines. We show how a
multi-stable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very
simply, by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been
configured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have
simple, homogenous locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction
of recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the
required states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue
to express the current state even after the input that elicted that state is
withdrawn. In addition, a small number of 'transition neurons' implement the
necessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide
simple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of
this kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby
the cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated
processing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal

retrograde and prograde jets, with a prograde (superrotating) jet at the
equator. Existing models posit as the driver of the flow either differential
radiative heating of the atmosphere or intrinsic heat fluxes emanating from the
deep interior; however, they do not reproduce all large-scale features of
Jupiter's jets and thermal structure. Here it is shown that the difficulties in
accounting for Jupiter's jets and thermal structure resolve if the effects of
differential radiative heating and intrinsic heat fluxes are considered
together, and if upper-tropospheric dynamics are linked to a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drag that acts deep in the atmosphere. Baroclinic
eddies generated by differential radiative heating can account for the
off-equatorial jets; meridionally propagating equatorial Rossby waves generated
by intrinsic convective heat fluxes can account for the equatorial
superrotation. The zonal flow extends deeply into the atmosphere, with its
speed changing with depth, up to depths at which the MHD drag acts. The theory
is supported by simulations with an energetically consistent general
circulation model of Jupiter's outer atmosphere. A simulation that incorporates
differential radiative heating and intrinsic heat fluxes reproduces Jupiter's
observed jets and thermal structure and makes testable predictions about as-yet
unobserved aspects thereof. A control simulation that incorporates only
differential radiative heating but not intrinsic heat fluxes produces
off-equatorial jets but no equatorial superrotation; another control simulation
that incorporates only intrinsic heat fluxes but not differential radiative
heating produces equatorial superrotation but no off-equatorial jets.

vortices appear in a very particular sector of the theory characterized by
special values of the coupling constants, and by a constraint that leads to an
infinite number of conserved charges. The theory is scale invariant in that
sector, and the solutions satisfy Bogomolny type equations. The energy of the
static vortex is proportional to its topological charge, and waves can travel
with the speed of light along them, adding to the energy a term proportional to
a U(1) Noether charge they create. We believe such vortices may play a role in
the strong coupling regime of the pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.

hundred million solar masses. Remarkably, clusters with masses in the range
10^4 to 10^6 solar mases show no systematic variation of radius with mass.
However, recent observations have shown that clusters with masses greater than
3x10^6 solar masses do show an increase in size with increasing mass. We point
out that clusters with m>10^6 solar masses were optically thick to far infrared
radiation when they formed, and explore the hypothesis that the size of
clusters with m> 3x10^6 solar masses is set by a balance between accretion
powered radiation pressure and gravity when the clusters formed, yielding a
mass-radius relation r~0.3(m/10^6M_\odot)^{3/5} pc. We show that the Jeans mass
in optically thick objects increases systematically with cluster mass. We
argue, by assuming that the break in the stellar initial mass function is set
by the Jeans mass, that optically thick clusters are born with top heavy
initial mass functions; it follows that they are over-luminous compared to
optically thin clusters when young, and have a higher mass to light ratio
Upsilon_V=m/L_V when older than ~1 Gyr. Old, optically thick clusters have
Upsilon_V~ mcl^{0.1-0.3}. It follows that L_V~\sigma^{\beta}, where \sigma is
the cluster velocity dispersion, and \beta~4. It appears that Upsilon_V is an
increasing function of cluster mass for compact clusters and ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies. We show that this is unlikely to be due to the presence of
non-baryonic dark matter, by comparing clusters to Milky Way satellite
galaxies, which are dark matter dominated. The satellite galaxies appear to
have a fixed mass inside a fiducial radius, M(r=r_0)=const.

spatially correlated disordered magnetic fields are investigated numerically.
It is found that the correlation drastically changes the transport properties
associated with the edge state, in contrast to the naive expectation that the
correlation simply reduces the effect of disorder. In the presence of
correlation, the separation between the successive conductance plateau
transitions becomes larger than the bulk Landau level separation determined by
the mean value of the disordered magnetic fields. The transition energies
coincide with the Landau levels in an effective magnetic field stronger than
the mean value of the disordered magnetic field. For a long wire, the strength
of this effective magnetic field is of the order of the maximum value of the
magnetic fields in the system. It is shown that the effective field is

related probabilistic logics. We first show that the metrics provide a bound
for the difference in long-run average and discounted average behavior across
states, indicating that the metrics can be used both in system verification,
and in performance evaluation. For turn-based games and MDPs, we provide a
polynomial-time algorithm for the computation of the one-step metric distance
between states. The algorithm is based on linear programming; it improves on
the previous known exponential-time algorithm based on a reduction to the
theory of reals. We then present PSPACE algorithms for both the decision
problem and the problem of approximating the metric distance between two
states, matching the best known algorithms for Markov chains. For the
bisimulation kernel of the metric our algorithm works in time O(n^4) for both
turn-based games and MDPs; improving the previously best known O(n^9\cdot
log(n)) time algorithm for MDPs. For a concurrent game G, we show that
computing the exact distance between states is at least as hard as computing
the value of concurrent reachability games and the square-root-sum problem in
computational geometry. We show that checking whether the metric distance is
bounded by a rational r, can be done via a reduction to the theory of real
closed fields, involving a formula with three quantifier alternations, yielding
O(|G|^O(|G|^5)) time complexity, improving the previously known reduction,

cluster, all other solutions of which are reachable from this one through a

frozen to the same spin values by one of two different mechanisms: frozen-core
formation and long-range frustrations. While frozen cores are identified by a
local whitening algorithm, long-range frustrations are very difficult to trace,
and they make an entropic belief-propagation (BP) algorithm fail to converge.
For BP to reach a fixed point the spin values of a tiny fraction of variables

iteration. From the calculated entropy values, we infer that, for a large
random 3-SAT formula with constraint density close to the satisfiability

spectral studies of a classical nova. The spectra evolve from a P-Cygni phase
to an emission-line phase and at a later stage is dominated by emission from
the dust that formed in this nova. A detailed model is computed to identify and
study characteristics of the spectral lines. Inferences from the model address
the vexing question of which novae have the ability to form dust. It is
demonstrated, and strikingly corroborated with observations, that the presence
of lines in the early spectra of low-ionization species like Na and Mg -
indicative of low temperature conditions - appear to be reliable indicators
that dust will form in the ejecta. It is theoretically expected that mass loss
during a nova outburst is a sustained process. Spectroscopic evidence for such
a sustained mass loss, obtained by tracing the evolution of a P-Cygni feature
in the Brackett gamma line, is presented here allowing a lower limit of 25-27
days to be set for the mass-loss duration. Photometric data recording the
nova's extended 12 day climb to peak brightness after discovery is used to
establish an early fireball expansion and also show that the ejection began

wireless networks. In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a
contention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among
links. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other
completely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not
the case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can
vary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the
links is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,
this partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide
range of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with
the 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn
from previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper
establishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a
foundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that
end, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing
phenomenon. We discuss the implications and the use of our partial carrier
sensing model in network analysis.

forced by the colliding cavity walls. Based on this insight, we then show how

non-supersymmetric version of the model and the fine-tuning of the initial
conditions of the fields leading to sufficient inflation to account for the
standard cosmological problems. They are investigated by studying the exact
two-fields dynamics instead of assuming slow-roll. When the field values are
restricted to be less than the reduced Planck mass, a non-negligible part of
the initial condition space (around 15% depending on potential parameters)
leads to successful inflation. Most of it is located outside the usual
inflationary valley and organized in continuous patterns instead of being
isolated as previously found. Their existence is explained and their properties
are studied. This shows that no excessive fine-tuning is required for
successful hybrid inflation. Moreover, by extending the initial condition space
to planckian-like or super-planckian values, inflation becomes generically
sufficiently long and can produce a red-tilted scalar power spectrum due to
slow-roll violations. The robustness of these properties is confirmed by
conducting our analysis on three other models of hybrid-type inflation in
various framework: ""smooth"" and ""shifted"" inflation in SUSY and SUGRA, and
""radion assisted"" gauge inflation. A high percentage of successful inflation
for smooth hybrid inflation (up to 80%) is observed.

flared.The average depth in the bar region is 4.0$\pm$1.4 kpc. The northern
disk is found to have depth(4.17$\pm$0.97 kpc)larger than the southern part of
the disk (2.63$\pm$0.8kpc).There is no indication of depth variation between
the eastern and the western disk.The average depth for the disk is 3.44$\pm$

feature in the SMC is the increase in depth near the optical center.The large
dispersions estimated for the LMC bar and the northern disk suggest that the
LMC either has large depth and/or different stellar populations in these
regions.The halo of the LMC(using RR Lyrae stars)is found to have larger depth
compared to the disk/bar,which supports the existence of an inner halo for the
LMC.On the other hand, the estimated depths for the halo(RR Lyrae stars)and

enhanced stellar as well as HI density near the optical center suggests that
the SMC may have a bulge.

rational tropical curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, with $g\geq 2$.
We reduce the study of the homotopy type of these spaces to the analysis of
compact spaces $X_{g,n}$, which in turn possess natural representations as a
homotopy colimits of diagrams of topological spaces over combinatorially
defined generalized simplicial complexes $\Delta_g$, with the latter being
interesting on their own right.
  We use these homotopy colimit representations to describe a CW complex
decomposition for each $X_{g,n}$. Furthermore, we use these developments,
coupled with some standard tools for working with homotopy colimits, to perform
an in-depth analysis of special cases of genus 2 and 3, gaining a complete
understanding of the moduli spaces $X_{2,0}$, $X_{2,1}$, $X_{2,2}$, and
$X_{3,0}$, as well as a partial understanding of other cases, resulting in
several open questions and in further conjectures.

depend on their initial radii $a_{\rm ini}$. For Type II SNRs expanding into
the ambient medium with density of $n_{\rm H,0} = 1$ cm$^{-3}$, grains of
$a_{\rm ini} < 0.05$ $\mu$m are detained in the shocked hot gas and are
completely destroyed, while grains of $a_{\rm ini} > 0.2$ $\mu$m are injected
into the surrounding medium without being destroyed significantly. Grains with
$a_{\rm ini}$ = 0.05-0.2 $\mu$m are finally trapped in the dense shell behind
the forward shock. We show that the grains piled up in the dense shell enrich
the gas up to 10$^{-6}-10^{-4}$ $Z_\odot$, high enough to form low-mass stars
with 0.1-1 $M_\odot$. In addition, [Fe/H] in the dense shell ranges from -6 to
-4.5, which is in good agreement with the ultra-metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] <
-4. We suggest that newly formed dust in a Population III SN can have great
impacts on the stellar mass and elemental composition of Population II.5 stars

atomic center-of-mass plays the role of ""quantum apparatus"" for the atomic

Our conclusions are somewhat surprising: only if the screen capturing the atoms
in the experiment brings the information about the atomic-nucleus
center-of-mass, one may construct the model desired. The nucleus $CM$ system is
monitored by the nucleus ""relative system ($R$)"". There appear the effective
(the electrons-mediated) interaction between $CM$ and $R$ that is possibly
responsible for decoherence. For larger atoms, the interaction scales as $Z^2$
($Z$ is the ""atomic number""), being totally independent on the atomic mass. The
interaction selects the $CM$-wave-packet states as the approximate pointer
basis. Interestingly enough, the model stems nonoccurrence of decoherence due
to the internal environment for the larger systems (such as the macromolecules
and the macroscopic systems). Certainly, disproving this model (e.g. in an
experiment) stems the active role of the screen, which becomes responsible for
the ""$CM$ + spin""-state ""reduction"" (""collapse""), i.e. for the irreversible

important in nanostructures (e.g. qubits) where there might be strong coupling
to a small number of fluctuators. We first revisit the pedagogical example of
dephasing by classical telegraph noise. Then we address two models where the
quantum nature of the noise becomes essential: ""quantum telegraph noise"" and
dephasing by electronic shot noise. In fermionic systems, many-body aspects and
the Pauli principle have to be taken care of when describing the loss of phase
coherence. This is relevant in electronic quantum transport through metallic
and semiconducting structures. Specifically, we recount our recent results
regarding dephasing in a chiral interacting electron liquid, as it is realized
in the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This model can be solved

solutions to the generalized KdV (g-KdV) in a neighborhood of the origin in the
spectral plane using what amounts to a rigorous Whitham modulation theory
calculation. In particular we are interested in understanding the role played
by the null directions of the linearized operator in the stability of the
traveling wave to perturbations of long wavelength.
  A study of the normal form of the characteristic polynomial of the monodromy
map (the periodic Evan's function) in a neighborhood of the origin in the
spectral plane leads to two different instability indices. The first index
counts modulo 2 the total number of periodic eigenvalues on the real axis. This
index is a generalization of the one which governs the stability of the
solitary wave. The second index provides a necessary and sufficient condition
for the existence of a long-wavelength instability. This index is essentially
the quantity calculated by Haragus and Kapitula in the small amplitude limit.
Both of these quantities can be expressed in terms of the map between the
constants of integration for the ordinary differential equation defining the
traveling waves and the conserved quantities of the partial differential
equation. These two indices together provide a good deal of information about
the spectrum of the linearized operator.
  We sketch the connection of this calculation to a study of the linearized
operator - in particular we perform a perturbation calculation in terms of the
Floquet parameter. This suggests geometric interpretations attached to the
vanishing of the modulational instability index previously mentioned.

(SN) spectra developed within the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) collaboration.
  Method: The new spectral extraction method takes full advantage of
photometric information from the Canada-France-Hawai telescope (CFHT) discovery
and reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and the
host signals on the spectrogram. When present, the host spatial profile is
measured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the host
contribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. The supernova is modelled
as a Gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. A chi-square minimisation
provides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2D spectrogram. For a
host-supernova separation greater than <~ 1 pixel, the two components are
recovered separately and we do not use a spectral template in contrast to more
standard analyses. This new procedure permits a clean extraction of the
supernova separately from the host in about 70% of the 3rd year ESO/VLT spectra
of the SNLS. A new supernova identification method is also proposed. It uses
the SALT2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectral
data. A galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extraction
of the supernova and the host was not possible.
  Result: These new techniques have been tested against more standard
extraction and identification procedures. They permit a secure type and
redshift determination in about 80% of cases. The present paper illustrates
their performances on a few sample spectra.

Its periodic fast X-ray transient activity and its position in the Corbet
diagram - although ambiguous - led to the conclusion that the source was a
likely Be/X-ray binary (BeXB), even if a supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT)
nature could not be excluded. We aimed at identifying the companion star of IGR
J18483-0311 to discriminate between the BeXB and the SFXT nature of the source.
Optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy of
the companion star were performed to identify its spectral type. We also
assembled and fitted its broad-band spectral energy distribution to derive its
physical parameters. We show that the companion star of IGR J18483-0311 is an
early-B supergiant, likely a B0.5Ia, and that its distance is about 3-4 kpc.
The early-B supergiant nature of its companion star, as well as its fast X-ray
transient activity point towards an SFXT nature of IGR J18483-0311.
Nevertheless, the long duration and the periodicity of its outbursts, as well
as its high level of quiescence, are consistent with IGR J18483-0311 being an
intermediate SFXT, in between classical supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs)
characterised by small and circular orbits, and classical SFXTs with large and
eccentric orbits.

for its massive debris disk. It was rather regarded as a gravitationally bound
triple system but recent measurements of the HD 141569A radial velocity seem to
invalidate this hypothesis. The flyby scenario has therefore to be investigated
to test its compatibility with the observations. We present a study of the
flyby scenario for the HD141569 system, by considering 3 variants: a sole
flyby, a flyby associated with one planet and a flyby with two planets. We use
analytical calculations and perform N-body numerical simulations of the flyby
encounter. The binary orbit is found to be almost fixed by the observational
constraint on a edge-on plane with respect to the observers. If the binary has
had an influence on the disk structure, it should have a passing time at the
periapsis between 5000 and 8000 years ago and a distance at periapsis between
600 and 900 AU. The best scenario for reproducing the disk morphology is a
flyby with only 1 planet. For a 2 Mj (resp. 8 Mj) planet, its eccentricity must
be around 0.2 (resp. below 0.1). In the two cases, its apoapsis is about 130
AU. Although the global disk shape is reasonably well reproduced, some features
cannot be explain by the present model and the likehood of the flyby event
remains an issue. Dynamically speaking, HD 141569 is still a puzzling system.

generated in a circumbinary (CB) disk. The third, longest period is
attributable to the precession of the inner asymmetric region of CB disk. The
relationship between the amplitudes of these cycles depends on the model
parameters as well as on the inclination and orientation of the binary in
space. We show that at a dust-to-gas ratio of 1:100 and and a mass extinction
coefficient of 250 cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, the amplitude of the brightness variations
of the primary component in the V-band can reach $1^m$ at a mass accretion rate
onto the binary components of $10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a $10^{\rm o}$
inclination of the binary plane to the line of sight. We discuss possible
applications of the model to pre-main-sequence stars.

in its ultrapower. We discuss this idea and its consequences for automorphisms

approximately inner if and only if its ultrapower is aleph_0-locally inner; (2)
the ultrapower of an outer automorphism is always outer; (3) for unital
*-homomorphisms from a separable nuclear C*-algebra into an ultrapower of a
II_1 factor, equality of the induced traces implies unitary equivalence. All

Standard Model (SM) gauge fields are allowed to propagate in an additional
dimension, compactified on $S^1$ or $S^1/Z_2$. In a minimal scenario, fermions
propagate in the 5D RS subspace and their localization provides a model of
flavor. New Kaluza-Klein (KK) states, corresponding to excitations of the gauge
fields along the 6th dimension, appear near the TeV scale. The new gauge KK
modes behave differently from those in the 5D warped models. These RS6 states
have couplings with strong dependence on 5D field localization and, within the
SM, only interact with heavy fermions and the Higgs sector, to a very good
approximation. Thus, the collider phenomenology of the new gauge KK states
sensitively depends on the 5D fermion geography. We briefly discuss inclusion
of SM fermions in all 6 dimensions, as well as the possibility of going beyond
6D.

derive w as a function of the scale factor; these solutions depend on the
curvature of the potential near its maximum. Our general result is in excellent
agreement (delta w < 0.5%) with all of the particular cases examined. It works
particularly well (delta w < 0.1%) for the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson

distribution is described by a gamma-model while the total density distribution
has a pure r^(-2) profile, are presented. The orbital structure of the stellar
component is described by Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy, while the dark matter
halo is isotropic. After a description of minimum halo models, the positivity
of the phase-space density (the model consistency) is investigated, and
necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency are obtained analytically
as a function of the stellar inner density slope gamma and anisotropy radius.
The explicit phase-space distribution function is recovered for integer values
of gamma, and it is shown that while models with gamma>4/17 are consistent when
the anisotropy radius is larger than a critical value (dependent on gamma), the
gamma=0 models are unphysical even in the fully isotropic case. The Jeans
equations for the stellar component are then solved analytically; in addition,
the projected velocity dispersion at the center and at large radii are also
obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy radius, and it is
found that they are given by remarkably simple expressions. The presented
models, even though highly idealized, can be useful as starting point for more
advanced modeling of the mass distribution of elliptical galaxies in studies
combining stellar dynamics and gravitational lensing.
