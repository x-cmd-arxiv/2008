simultaneously reproduces the abundances, redshift distributions and clustering
of all three observed populations. The star formation rates (SFRs) of model
LBGs and BXs are lower than those quoted for real samples, reflecting different
initial mass functions and scatter in model dust properties. About 85% of model
galaxies selected as DRGs are star-forming, with SFRs ranging up to 100
M_sun/yr. Model LBGs, BXs and DRGs together account for less than half of all
star formation over the range 1.5<z<3.2. Model BXs have metallicities which
agree roughly with observation, but model LBGs are only slightly more
metal-poor, in disagreement with recent observational results. Model galaxies
are predominantly disk-dominated. About 30% of model galaxies with
M>10^{11}M_sun are classified as LBGs or BXs at the relevant redshifts, while
65% are classified as DRGs. Almost all model LBGs and BXs are central galaxies,
but about a quarter of DRGs are satellites. Half of all LBG descendants at z=2
would be identified as BX's, but very few as DRGs. Clustering increases with
decreasing redshift for descendants of all three populations, becoming stronger
than that of L^* galaxies by z=0, when many have become satellite galaxies.
Their stellar mass growth is dominated by star formation until z~1 and
thereafter by mergers. Most LBGs and DRGs end up as red ellipticals, while BXs
have a more varied fate. 99% of local galaxies with M>10^{11.5}M_sun are
predicted to have at least one LBG/BX/DRG progenitor, and over 70% above

galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS)
techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence
to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and
stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a
series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar
evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the
expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A
Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR
photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with
this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z~0 carry errors of ~0.3
dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z~2, the
masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level; 2) either
current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or
both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the
thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on
the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that
luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in
the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the
evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption
of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is
usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors
blueward of the V-band. (ABRIDGED)

sensitive to the choice of the model, and that it is reduced in the saturation
model. We find that v2 of quarks and gluons in parton-nucleus collisions have
very different patterns. The azimuthal asymmetry of gluons in gluon-nucleus
collisions can be negative at small transverse momentum, changes the sign and
becomes positive at high transverse momentum. The azimuthal asymmetry of quarks

hypersurface volume goes to zero instantaneously at the `Big Bang', but all
physical quantities, such as curvature invariants and the matter energy density
remain finite, and continue smoothly through the Big Bang. We demonstrate that
there exist geodesics extending through the Big Bang, but that there are also
incomplete geodesics that spiral infinitely around a topologically closed
spatial dimension at the Big Bang, rendering it, at worst, a quasi-regular
singularity. The model is thus reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in
that it has biaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a
dimensionality reduction at a quasi-regular singularity; the two models are,
however, rather different, as we will show in a future work. Here we
concentrate on the cosmological implications of our model and show how the
scalar field drives both isotropisation and inflation, thus raising the
question of whether structure on the largest scales was laid down at a time
when the universe was still oblate (as also suggested by Pitrou et al and
Contaldi et al). We also discuss the stability of our model to small
perturbations around biaxiality and draw an analogy with cosmological
perturbations. We conclude by presenting a separate, bouncing solution, which
generalises the known bouncing solution in closed FRW universes.

the paramagnetic phase is described within the thermoballistic transport model.
In this (semiclassical) model, the ballistic and diffusive transport mechanisms
are unified in terms of a thermoballistic current in which electrons move
ballistically across intervals enclosed between arbitrarily distributed points
of local thermal equilibrium. The contribution of each interval to the current
is governed by the momentum relaxation length. Spin relaxation is assumed to
take place during the ballistic electron motion. In paramagnetic DMS exposed to
an external magnetic field, the conduction band is spin-split due to the giant
Zeeman effect. In order to deal with this situation, we extend our previous
formulation of thermoballistic spin-polarized transport so as to take into
account an arbitrary (position-dependent) spin splitting of the conduction
band. The current and density spin polarizations as well as the
magnetoresistance are each obtained as the sum of an equilibrium term
determined by the spin-relaxed chemical potential, and an off-equilibrium
contribution expressed in terms of a spin transport function that is related to
the splitting of the spin-resolved chemical potentials. The procedures for the
calculation of the spin-relaxed chemical potential and of the spin transport
function are outlined. As an illustrative example, we apply the thermoballistic
description to spin-polarized transport in DMS/NMS/DMS heterostructures formed
of a nonmagnetic semiconducting sample (NMS) sandwiched between two DMS layers.
We evaluate the current spin polarization and the magnetoresistance for this
case and, in the limit of small momentum relaxation length, find our results to
agree with those of the standard drift-diffusion approch to electron transport.

of a vibrated granular gas are studied by means of molecular dynamics
simulations. From the second moment of the distribution, a temperature
parameter for the piston is defined and compared with the granular temperature
of the gas located just below it. Then the two temperature parameters refer to
two interacting macroscopic systems. The equipartition of energy valid in usual
molecular systems is strongly violated, and the temperature of the piston can
be larger or smaller than the one of the gas, depending of the parameters
defining the system at the particle level. The simulation results for the ratio
of temperatures are in agreement with some theoretical predictions from kinetic
theory assuming the validity of a hydrodynamic description in the limit of weak
inelasticity of the gas.

determined the invariant factors of the $\ell$-Cartan matrix for $S_n$
(equivalently, the invariant factors of the Cartan matrix for the Iwahori-Hecke
algebra $\mathcal{H}_n(q)$, where $q$ is a primitive $\ell$th root of unity).
We call these invariant factors Cartan invariants.
  In a previous paper, the second author calculated these Cartan invariants
when $\ell=p^r$, $p$ prime, and $r\leq p$ and went on to conjecture that the
formulae should hold for all $r$. Another result was obtained, which is
surprising and counterintuitive from a block theoretic point of view. Namely,
given the prime decomposition $\ell=p_1^{r_1}... p_k^{r_k}$, the Cartan matrix
of an $\ell$-block of $S_n$ is a product of Cartan matrices associated to
$p_i^{r_i}$-blocks of $S_n$. In particular, the invariant factors of the Cartan
matrix associated to an $\ell$-block of $S_n$ can be recovered from the Cartan
matrices associated to the $p_i^{r_i}$-blocks.
  In this paper, we formulate an explicit combinatorial determination of the
Cartan invariants of $S_n$--not only for the full Cartan matrix, \emph{but for
an individual block}. We collect evidence for this conjecture, by showing that
the formulae predict the correct determinant of the $\ell$-Cartan matrix. We
then go on to show that Hill's conjecture implies the conjecture of KOR.

basic properties and stability in these systems remains an outstandingly
difficult question both for analytical and numerical treatment. Here I propose
a new perturbative approach to treat self-consistently all the degrees of
freedom in the problem. I show that there exists a length scale for a Hopfion
texture where the electrodynamics of a two-component superconductor is
dominated by a self-induced Faddeev term, which is a stark contrast to the
Meissner electrodynamics of single-component systems. I also show that at
certain short length scales knotted solitons in two-component Ginzburg-Landau
model are not described by a Faddeev-Skyrme-type model and are unstable.
However these solitons can be stable at some intermediate length scales. I
argue that configurations with a high topological charge may be more stable in
this system than low-topological-charge configurations. In the second part of
the paper I discuss qualitatively different physics of the stability of knotted
solitons in a more general Ginzburg-Landau model and point out the physically
relevant terms which enhance or suppress stability of the knotted solitons.
With this argument it is demonstrated that the generalized Ginburg-Landau model

$\epsilon^{\rho +}_n =\Delta n/ g$ and $\epsilon^{\rho -(\sigma \pm)}_n =

influencing the magnetic activity of both bodies, as well as affecting

potential varies in time and this is, in principle, observable. Using an N-body
simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM universe, we show that linear theory is not
sufficiently accurate to predict the power spectrum of the time derivative,
$\dot{\Phi}$, needed to compute the imprint of large-scale structure on the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). The linear part of the $\dot{\Phi}$ power
spectrum (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or ISW) drops quickly as the
relative importance of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ diminishes at high redshift, while
the non-linear part (the Rees-Sciama effect or RS) evolves more slowly with
redshift. Therefore, the deviation of the total power spectrum from linear
theory occurs at larger scales at higher redshifts. The deviation occurs at
$k\sim 0.1 $ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$. The cross-correlation power spectrum of
the density $\delta$ with $\dot{\Phi}$ behaves differently to the power
spectrum of $\dot{\Phi}$. Firstly, the deviation from linear theory occurs at
smaller scales ($k\sim 1 $ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$). Secondly, the correlation
becomes negative when the non-linear effect dominates. For the
cross-correlation power spectrum of galaxy samples with the CMB, the non-linear
effect becomes significant at $l\sim 500$ and rapidly makes the cross power
spectrum negative. For high redshift samples, the cross-correlation is expected
to be suppressed by $5-10%$ on arcminute scales. The RS effect makes a
negligible contribution to the large-scale ISW cross-correlation measurement.
However, on arc-minute scales it will contaminate the expected
cross-correlation signal induced by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

with Tonry & Schneider (1998) definition in the very particular case that
psi(N) is assumed to be a Poisson distribution. However, the Poisson
contribution to theoretical SBF is around 0.1% of the contribution due to the
stellar population SBF, so there is no justification to include any reference
to Poisson statistics in the SBF definition; (iii) observational SBF, which are
those obtained in observations that are distributed around the theoretical SBF.
Finally, we show alternative ways to compute SBF and extend the application of
stellar population SBF to defining a metric of fitting for standard stellar
population studies. CONCLUSIONS: We demostrate that SBF are observational
evidence of a probabilistic paradigm in population synthesis, where integrated
luminosities have an intrinsic distributed nature, and they rule out the
commonly assumed deterministic paradigm of stellar population modeling.

in the ionizing background (usually measured through the Lyman-alpha optical
depth toward distant quasars). Conventional wisdom associates this with the
""overlap"" phase when ionized bubbles merge, allowing each source to affect a
much larger volume. We argue that this picture fails to describe the transition
to the post-overlap Universe, where Lyman-limit systems absorb ionizing photons
over moderate lengthscales (20-100 Mpc). Using an analytic model, we compute
the probability distribution of the amplitude of the ionizing background
throughout reionization, including both discrete ionized bubbles and
Lyman-limit systems (parameterized by an attenuation length). We show that
overlap does not by itself cause a rapid increase in the ionizing background or
a rapid decrease in the mean Lyman-alpha transmission toward distant quasars.
More detailed semi-numeric models support these conclusions. We argue that
rapid changes should instead be interpreted as evolution in the attenuation
length itself, which may or may not be directly related to overlap.

the evolution of a number of surface and gas-phase species. We find differences

differences for species formed on the surface of dust grains. These differences
are due primarily to the addition of C$^+$ DR, which increases the neutral C
abundance, thereby enhancing the accretion of C onto dust. These results may be
important for the warm-up phase of molecular clouds when surface species are
desorbed into the gas phase. We also note that no reliable state-of-the-art RR

We present a new technique, Counts-in-Cylinders (CiC), to constrain the
parameters of the satellite contribution to the LRG Halo-Occupation
Distribution (HOD). For a fiber collision-corrected SDSS spectroscopic LRG
subsample at 0.16 < z < 0.36, we find the CiC multiplicity function is fit by a
halo model where the average number of satellites in a halo of mass M is
<Nsat(M)> = ((M - Mcut)/M1)^alpha with Mcut = 5.0 +1.5/-1.3 (+2.9/-2.6) X 10^13

  Our method tightly constrains the fraction of LRGs that are satellite
galaxies, 6.36 +0.38/-0.39, and the combination Mcut/10^{14} Msun + alpha =
1.53 +0.08/-0.09 at the 95% confidence level. We also find that mocks based on
a halo catalog produced by a spherical overdensity (SO) finder reproduce both
the measured CiC multiplicity function and the projected correlation function,
while mocks based on a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo catalog has a deficit of
close pairs at ~1 Mpc/h separations. Because the CiC method relies on higher
order statistics of close pairs, it is robust to the choice of halo finder. In
a companion paper we will apply this technique to optimize Finger-of-God (FOG)
compression to eliminate the 1-halo contribution to the LRG power spectrum.

commutation relations between any pair of coordinates $\hat x,\hat y$
generating two different copies of the space, or equivalently a $\star$-tensor
product $f(x)\star g(y)$ (in the parlance of Aschieri et al. [3]) between any
two functions depending on $x,y$. Then all differences $(x-y)^\mu$ behave like
their undeformed counterparts. Imposing (minimally adapted) Wightman axioms one
finds that the $n$-point functions fulfill the same general properties as on
commutative space. Actually, upon computation one finds (at least for scalar
fields) that the $n$-point functions remain unchanged as functions of the
coordinates' differences both if fields are free and if they interact (we treat
interactions via time-ordered perturbation theory). The main, surprising
outcome seems a QFT physically equivalent to the undeformed counterpart (to
confirm it or not one should however first clarify the relation between
$n$-point functions and observables, in particular S-matrix elements).

electromagnetism has a little drawback: It has a primary constraint submanifold
that arise from the fact that the dynamics is governed by the antisymmetric
part of the jet variables. So it is natural to ask if there exists a
formulation of this kind of field theories which avoids this problem, retaining
the versatility of the known approach. The following paper deals with a family
of variational problems, namely, the so called non standard variational
problems, which intends to capture the data necessary to set up such a
formulation for field theories; moreover, we will formulate a multisymplectic
structure for the family of non standard variational problems, and we will
relate this with the (pre)symplectic structure arising on the space of sections
of the bundle of fields. In this setting the Dirac theory of constraints will
be studied, obtaining among other things a novel characterization of the
constraint manifold which arises in this theory, as generators of an exterior
differential system associated to the equations of motion and the chosen

of them motivated from the physical point of view, that is, electromagnetism

significant role in theoretical physics. Field theories with infinitely many
derivatives are ubiquitous in string field theory and have attracted interest
recently also from cosmologists. Crucial to any application is a firm
understanding of the mathematical structure of infinite order partial
differential equations. In our previous work we developed a formalism to study
the initial value problem for linear infinite order equations with constant
coefficients. Our approach relied on the use of a contour integral
representation for the functions under consideration. In many applications,
including the study of cosmological perturbations in nonlocal inflation, one
must solve linearized partial differential equations about some time-dependent
background. This typically leads to variable coefficient equations, in which
case the contour integral methods employed previously become inappropriate. In
this paper we develop the theory of a particular class of linear infinite order
partial differential equations with variable coefficients. Our formalism is
particularly well suited to the types of equations that arise in nonlocal
cosmological perturbation theory. As an example to illustrate our formalism we
compute the leading corrections to the scalar field perturbations in p-adic
inflation and show explicitly that these are small on large scales.

dynamics of an excess electron in a supercritical fluid over a broad range of
densities. The accuracy of the RPMD model is tested against numerically exact
path integral statistics through the use of analytical continuation techniques.
At low fluid densities, the RPMD model substantially underestimates the
contribution of delocalized states to the dynamics of the excess electron.
However, with increasing solvent density, the RPMD model improves, nearly
satisfying analytical continuation constraints at densities approaching those
of typical liquids. In the high density regime, quantum dispersion
substantially decreases the self-diffusion of the solvated electron.
  In this regime where the dynamics of the electron is strongly coupled to the
dynamics of the atoms in the fluid, trajectories that can reveal diffusive
motion of the electron are long in comparison to $\beta\hbar$.

via spectral synthesis of Be II lines near 3130 \AA. The Be abundances were
investigated as a function of age, temperature, metallicity and Li abundance in
this narrow mass range. Even though our stars are similar in mass, they show a
range in Be abundances of a factor of $>$40. We find that [Be/Fe] has no
dependence on temperature, but does show a spread of a factor of 6 at a given
temperature. The reality of the spread is shown by two identical stars which
differ from each other by a factor of two only in their abundances of Li and
Be. Our thin-disk-star sample fits the trend between Be abundance and [Fe/H]
found for halo and thick disk stars, extending it to about 4 orders of
magnitude in the two logarithmic quantities. Both Fe and Be appear to increase
similarly over time in the Galaxy. One-third of our sample may be classified as
subgiants; these more-evolved stars have lower Be abundances than the dwarfs.
They have undergone Be depletion by slow mixing on the main sequence and Be
dilution during their trip toward the red giant base. There are both Li and Be
detections in 60 field stars in the ""Li-plateau"" of 5900 - 6300 K now and the
abundances of the two light elements are correlated with a slope of 0.34

near-optimal performance (for those constellations). This has stimulated a
number of recent research endeavors that aim to apply SDR to the high-order QAM
cases. These independently developed SDRs are different in concept and
structure, and presently no serious analysis has been given to compare these
methods. This paper analyzes the relationship of three such SDR methods, namely
the polynomial-inspired SDR (PI-SDR) by Wiesel et al., the bound-constrained
SDR (BC-SDR) by Sidiropoulos and Luo, and the virtually-antipodal SDR (VA-SDR)

SDRs are equivalent. Simply speaking, we show that solving any one SDR is
equivalent to solving the other SDRs. This paper also discusses some
implications arising from the SDR equivalence, and provides simulation results
to verify our theoretical findings.

the reason that one would expect that a quantum mechanical scheme could

of the search algorithm"". The answer provided in this work is: ""because any
quantum algorithm takes the time taken by a classical algorithm that knows in
advance 50% of the information that specifies the solution of the problem"".
This empirical fact, unnoticed so far, holds for both quadratic and exponential
speed ups and is theoretically justified in three steps: (i) once the physical
representation is extended to the production of the problem on the part of the
oracle and to the final measurement of the computer register, quantum
computation is reduction on the solution of the problem under a relation
representing problem-solution interdependence, (ii) the speed up is explained
by a simple consideration of time symmetry, it is the gain of information about
the solution due to backdating, to before running the algorithm, a
time-symmetric part of the reduction on the solution; this advanced knowledge
of the solution reduces the size of the solution space to be explored by the
algorithm, (iii) if I is the information acquired by measuring the content of
the computer register at the end of the algorithm, the quantum algorithm takes
the time taken by a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of I, which
brings us to the initial statement.

quality of the fits is improved using predictions of the renormalization group
(RG) approach and of conformal invariance, and restricting the data within an
appropriate temperature window.
  The RG predictions on the cancelation of the logarithmic corrections in the
universal amplitude ratios are tested. A direct calculation of the effective
ratio of the energy amplitudes using duality relations explicitly demonstrates
this cancelation of logarithms, thus supporting the predictions of RG.
  We emphasize the role of corrections of background terms on the determination
of the amplitudes. The ratios of the critical amplitudes of the
susceptibilities obtained in our analysis differ significantly from those
predicted theoretically and supported by earlier SE and MC analysis. This

  Results for stars with spectral types M0-M4 -- i.e. with masses above or just

Tomographic imaging techniques allow us to reconstruct the surface magnetic
topologies from the rotationally modulated time-series of circularly polarised

  We find strong differences between partly and fully convective stars
concerning magnetic field topology and characteristic scales, and differential
rotation. Our results suggest that magnetic field generation in fully
convective stars relies on different dynamo processes than those acting in the
Sun and other partly convective stars, in agreement with theoretical

well-known traditional techniques in the literature to measure stock market
volatility, a central point in this debate that constitutes the actual scope of
this paper is to compare this common approach in which we discuss such popular
techniques as the standard deviation and an innovative methodology based on
Econophysics. In our study, we use the concept of Tsallis entropy to capture
the nature of volatility. More precisely, what we want to find out is if
Tsallis entropy is able to detect volatility in stock market indexes and to
compare its values with the ones obtained from the standard deviation. Also, we

to capture nonlinear dynamics. For our purpose, we shall basically focus on the

redshift are much more compact than local galaxies with the same stellar mass.
We argue that the observed strong evolution in size is directly related to the
quasar feedback, which removes huge amounts of cold gas from the central
regions in a Salpeter time, inducing an expansion of the stellar distribution.
The new equilibrium configuration, with a size increased by a factor >~ 3, is
attained after ~ 40 dynamical times, corresponding to ~ 2 Gyr. This means that
massive galaxies observed at z >~ 1 will settle on the Fundamental Plane by z ~
0.8-1. In less massive galaxies (M_star <~ 2 10^10 M_sun), the nuclear feedback
is subdominant, and the mass loss is mainly due to stellar winds. In this case,
the mass loss timescale is longer than the dynamical time and results in
adiabatic expansion that may increase the effective radius by a factor of up to
~ 2 in 10 Gyr, although a growth by a factor of ~ 1.6 occurs within the first
0.5 Gyr. Since observations are focused on relatively old galaxies, with ages
>~ 1 Gyr, the evolution for smaller galaxies is more difficult to perceive.
Significant evolution of velocity dispersion is predicted for both small and
large galaxies.

retransmission is either problematic or not possible. In case of multimedia or
multicast communications and in the context of the Delay Tolerant Networking
(DTN), the classical retransmission schemes can be counterproductive in terms
of data transfer performance or not possible when the acknowledgment path is
not always available. Indeed, over long delay links, packets retransmission has
a meaning of cost and must be minimized.In this paper, we detail a novel
reliability mechanism with an implicit acknowledgment strategy that could be
used either within these new DTN proposals, for multimedia traffic or in the
context of multicast transport protocols. This proposal is based on a new
on-the-fly erasure coding concept specifically designed to operate efficient
reliable transfer over bi-directional links. This proposal, named Tetrys,
allows to unify a full reliability with an error correction scheme. In this
paper, we model the performance of this proposal and demonstrate with a
prototype, that we can achieve a full reliability without acknowledgment path
confirmation. Indeed, the main findings are that Tetrys is not sensitive to the
loss of acknowledgments while ensuring a faster data availability to the
application compared to other traditional acknowledgment schemes. Finally, we
pave the first step of the integration of such algorithm inside a congestion
controlled protocol.

case of Smodels programs under the stable model semantics. The composition of
Smodels program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure
the compatibility of the module system with stable models. Hence the semantics
of an entire Smodels program depends directly on stable models assigned to its
modules. This result is formalized as a module theorem which truly strengthens
Lifschitz and Turner's splitting-set theorem for the class of Smodels programs.
To streamline generalizations in the future, the module theorem is first proved
for normal programs and then extended to cover Smodels programs using a
translation from the latter class of programs to the former class. Moreover,
the respective notion of module-level equivalence, namely modular equivalence,
is shown to be a proper congruence relation: it is preserved under
substitutions of modules that are modularly equivalent. Principles for program
decomposition are also addressed. The strongly connected components of the
respective dependency graph can be exploited in order to extract a module
structure when there is no explicit a priori knowledge about the modules of a
program. The paper includes a practical demonstration of tools that have been
developed for automated (de)composition of Smodels programs.

standard spin valves, where the spin transfer torque stabilizes one of the
magnetic configurations (either parallel or antiparallel) and destabilizes the
opposite one, differ from those in nonstandard (asymmetric) spin valves, where
both collinear configurations are stable for one current orientation and
unstable for the opposite one. Following this we propose a scheme of ultrafast
current-induced switching in nonstandard spin valves, based on a sequence of
two current pulses.

strong constraint provided by the light curves in the form of the normalized
separation $a/R_\star$ (related to the stellar density) in conjunction with our
new temperatures and metallicities. The masses and radii we derive are
$M_\star=0.928_{-0.048}^{+0.028} M_{\sun}$,$R_\star = 0.829_{-0.022}^{+0.015}

One is in the first order formalism where we treat \omega_{M}^{ab} as
independent and the other is in the second order formalism where
\omega_{M}^{ab} is determined in terms of other fields via a standard
constraint equation. The two theories have different equations of motion and
the solutions to the equations of motion of the first order theory spans only a
subset of those of the second order theory. We will be interested in computing
the boundary S-matrix, describing correlation functions in a dual conformal
field theory, in this sector and hence we use the equations of motion coming
out of the first order theory. We restrict ourselves to the gauge+fermionic
sector of the theory to compute the boundary S-matrix. We will also look at the
effect of higher derivative terms on the boundary S-matrix obtained using the
standard supergravity action.

velocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity divergence and
vorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have better noise properties
than for standard interpolation methods that deal with mass weighted
velocities. We show that high resolution simulations are required to recover
the correct large-scale vorticity power spectrum, while poor resolution can
spuriously amplify its amplitude by more than one order of magnitude. We
measure the scalar and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbit
crossing using an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, when
input into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity power
spectrum obtained from the Delaunay method. We incorporate orbit crossing
corrections to the evolution of large scale density and velocity fields in
perturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor modes. We find that at
large scales (k~0.1 h/Mpc) vector modes have very little effect in the density
power spectrum, while scalar modes (velocity dispersion) can induce percent
level corrections at z=0, particularly in the velocity divergence power
spectrum. In addition, we show that the velocity power spectrum is smaller than
predicted by linear theory until well into the nonlinear regime, with little

Gaussianized Blackwell-Rao (GBR) estimator. This estimator is derived by
transforming the observed marginal power spectrum distributions obtained by the
CMB Gibbs sampler into standard univariate Gaussians, and then approximate
their joint transformed distribution by a multivariate Gaussian. The method is
exact for full-sky coverage and uniform noise, and an excellent approximation
for sky cuts and scanning patterns relevant for modern satellite experiments
such as WMAP and Planck. A single evaluation of this estimator between l=2 and
200 takes ~0.2 CPU milliseconds, while for comparison, a single pixel space
likelihood evaluation between l=2 and 30 for a map with ~2500 pixels requires
~20 seconds. We apply this tool to the 5-year WMAP temperature data, and
re-estimate the angular temperature power spectrum, $C_{\ell}$, and likelihood,
L(C_l), for l<=200, and derive new cosmological parameters for the standard
six-parameter LambdaCDM model. Our spectrum is in excellent agreement with the
official WMAP spectrum, but we find slight differences in the derived
cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the spectral index of scalar
perturbations is n_s=0.973 +/- 0.014, 1.9 sigma away from unity and 0.6 sigma
higher than the official WMAP result, n_s = 0.965 +/- 0.014. This suggests that
an exact likelihood treatment is required to higher l's than previously
believed, reinforcing and extending our conclusions from the 3-year WMAP
analysis. In that case, we found that the sub-optimal likelihood approximation
adopted between l=12 and 30 by the WMAP team biased n_s low by 0.4 sigma, while

sequence of subgroups of the Torelli group of S, whose k-th term consists of
the self-homeomorphisms of S that act trivially at the level of the k-th
nilpotent quotient of P. Morita defined a homomorphism from the k-th term of
the Johnson filtration to the third homology group of the k-th nilpotent
quotient of P. In this paper, we replace groups by their Malcev Lie algebras
and we study the ""infinitesimal"" version of the k-th Morita homomorphism, which
is shown to correspond to the original version by a canonical isomorphism. We
provide a diagrammatic description of the k-th infinitesimal Morita
homomorphism and, given an expansion of the free group P that is ""symplectic""

Besides, we give a topological interpretation of the full tree-reduction of the
LMO homomorphism, which is a diagrammatic representation of the Torelli group
derived from the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant of 3-manifolds. More precisely,
a symplectic expansion of P is constructed from the LMO invariant, and it is
shown that the tree-level of the LMO homomorphism is equivalent to the total
Johnson map induced by this specific expansion. It follows that the k-th
infinitesimal Morita homomorphism coincides with the degree [k,2k[ part of the
tree-reduction of the LMO homomorphism. Our results also apply to the monoid of

such searches to earlier A-F type dwarfs and started spectroscopic surveys to
search for planets and quantify the detection limit achievable when taking into
account the stars properties and their actual levels of intrinsic variations.
We give here the first results of our southern survey with HARPS.
  Results: 1) 64% of the 170 stars with enough data points are found to be
variable. 20 are found to be binaries or candidate binaries (with stars or
brown dwarfs). More than 80% or the latest type stars (once binaries are
removed) are intrinsically variable at a 2 m/s precision level. Stars with
earlier spectral type (B-V <= 0.2) are either variable or associated to levels
of uncertainties comparable to the RV rms observed on variable stars of same
B-V. 2) We have detected one long-period planetary system around an F6IV-V
star. 3) We have quantified the jitter due to stellar activity and we show that
taking into account this jitter in addition to the stellar parameters, it is
still possible to detect planets with HARPS with periods of 3 days (resp. 10
days and 100 days) on 91% (resp. 83%, 61%) of them. We show that even the
earliest spectral type stars are accessible to this type of search, provided
they have a low vsini and low levels of activity. 4) Taking into account the
present data, we compute the actually achieved detection limits for 107 targets
and discuss the limits as a function of B-V. Given the data at hand, our survey
is sensitive to short-period (few days) planets and to longer ones (100 days)
at a lower extent (latest type stars). We derive first constrains on the
presence of planets around A-F stars for these ranges of periods.

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). There have been many recent attempts at radiative
transfer in SPH (Stamatellos et al 2005, 2005, Mayer et al 2007, Whitehouse and
Bate 2006), however these are becoming increasingly complex, with some methods
requiring the photosphere to be mapped (which is often of non-trivial geometric
shape), and extra conditions to be applied there (matching atmospheres as in
Cai et al (2008), or specifying cooling at the photosphere as in Mayer et al
(2007)). The method of identifying the photosphere is usually a significant
addition to the total simulation runtime, and often requires extra free
parameters, the changing of which will affect the final results. Our method is
not affected by such concerns, as the photosphere is constructed implicitly by
the algorithm without the need for extra free parameters. The algorithm used is
a synergy of two current formalisms for radiative effects: a) the polytropic
cooling formalism proposed by Stamatellos et al (2007), and b) flux-limited
diffusion, used by many authors to simulate radiation transport in the
optically thick regime (e.g. Mayer et al 2007). We present several tests of
this method: (1) The evolution of a 0.07 solar mass protoplanetary disc around
a 0.5 solarmass star (Pickett et al 2003, Mejia et al 2005, Boley et al 2006,

cloud (Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000, Stamatellos et al 2007); (3) The thermal
relaxation of temperature fluctuations in an static homogeneous sphere

measurements can be made of radio waves from spacecraft transmitters and
extragalactic radio sources, using radio telescopes and spacecraft tracking
antennas. Data have been taken at frequencies from about 80 MHz to 8000 MHz.
Lower frequencies probe plasma at greater heliocentric distances. Analysis of

plasma flow speeds in the corona and solar wind, and on the magnetic field in
the solar corona. This paper will concentrate on the information that can be

the magnetic field in this part of space. This technique has contributed to
measurement of the large scale coronal magnetic field, the properties of

radiatively-driven wind, resulting in X-ray emission that is harder, more
variable and more efficient than that produced by instability-generated shocks
in non-magnetic winds. Although magnetic confinement of stellar winds has been
shown to strongly modify the mass-loss and X-ray characteristics of massive OB
stars, we lack a detailed understanding of the complex processes responsible.
The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between magnetism, stellar
winds and X-ray emission of OB stars. In conjunction with a Chandra survey of
the Orion Nebula Cluster, we carried out spectropolarimatric ESPaDOnS
observations to determine the magnetic properties of massive OB stars of this
cluster. We found of two new massive magnetic stars in the Orion Nebula
Cluster: HD 36982 and HD 37061, for which the estimated dipole polar strengths
are 1150 (+320 -200) G and 620 (+220 -170) G, respectively. However, the
apparent lack of clear correlation between X-ray indicator and the presence of

Observations were obtained with both the X-ray Imaging spectrometer (XIS) and
the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD). Below 10 keV, the nuclear spectrum is dominated
by radiation reflected from cold dense gas of high column density, while above
13 keV the radiation is directly transmitted nuclear emission seen through a
column density of $~ 4 x 10^{24} cm^-2. In the 0.2--10 keV band, the XIS
spectrum is contaminated at 5% level by the brightest off-nuclear source in
Circinus (CG X-1), but drops to 1% in the 5-10 keV and is negligible at higher
energies. We find no significant evidence for variability in the hard (>12 keV)
emission. The Circinus is marginally detected with the HXD/GSO in the 50--100
keV band at 2.5\sigma level. We model the 3-70 keV band XIS+PIN spectra with a
four components: the Compton transmitted nuclear emission, the reflected
nuclear emission, a soft power law (representing a combination of scattered
nuclear emission, extended emission and contamination by sources in the galaxy
below a few keV). The hard nuclear power-law is found to have a photon index
Gamma_h ~= 1.6, very similar to the soft power-law. The high energy cut-off is
E_C ~= 49 keV. These results agree with those from BeppoSax. An extrapolation
of this model up to the GSO band shows good agreement with the GSO spectrum and
supports our detection of the Circinus up to ~= 100keV.

breaking of conformal symmetry which produces an effective mass term in the
unparticle propagator. Simultaneously, the unparticle couplings to other SM
fields produces an effective unparticle decay width via one-loop self-energy
graphs. The resulting unparticle propagator then leads to a rather unique
appearance for the shape of unparticle resonances that are not of the usual
Breit-Wigner variety when they form in high energy collisions. In this paper we
explore whether or not such resonances, appearing in the Drell-Yan channel at
the LHC, can be differentiated from more conventional $Z'$-like structures
which are representative of the typical Breit-Wigner lineshape. We will
demonstrate that even with the high integrated luminosities available at the
LHC it may be difficult to differentiate these two types of resonance
structures for a substantial range of the unparticle model parameters.

critical equation for an effective action by means of homological methods as
opposed to the cohomological localization of equivariantly closed forms in
local field theory. Our localization occurs for some special simple quasi BPS
Wilson loops, that have no perimeter divergence and no cusp anomaly for
backtracking cusps, in a partial Eguchi-Kawai reduction from four to two
dimensions of the non-commutative theory in the limit of infinite
non-commutativity and in a lattice regularization in which the ASD integration
variables live at the points of the lattice, thus implying an embedding of
parabolic Higgs bundles in the YM functional integral. We find that the beta
function of the effective action is saturated by the non-commutative ASD
vortices of the EK reduction. An exact canonical beta function of NSVZ type
that reproduces the universal first and second perturbative coefficients
follows by the localization on vortices. Finally we argue that a scheme can be
found in which the canonical coupling coincides with the physical charge
between static quark sources in the large-N limit and we compare our
