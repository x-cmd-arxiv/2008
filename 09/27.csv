supersymmetry breaking. Rather than reducing the generically large contribution
to Bmu we point out that acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking can be
achieved with mu^2 << Bmu if at the same time Bmu << m_Hd^2. This hierarchy can
easily appear in models where the Higgs fields are directly coupled to the
supersymmetry breaking sector. Such models can yield novel electroweak symmetry
breaking vacua, can deal with the supersymmetric flavor and CP problems, allow
for gauge coupling unification, and result in distinct phenomenological
predictions for the spectrum of superparticles.

which exhibits a superconductor like transition. In the superconducting phase
the black holes show infinite DC conductivity. This gives rise to the
possibility of deforming the solutions by turning on a time independent current
(supercurrent), without any electric field. This type of deformation does not
exist for normal (non-superconducting) black holes, due to the no-hair
theorems. In this paper we have studied such a supercurrent solution and the
associated phase diagram. Interestingly, we have found a ""special point""
(critical point) in the phase diagram where the second order superconducting
phase transition becomes first order. Supercurrent in superconducting materials
is a well studied phenomenon in condensed matter systems. We have found some
qualitative agreement with known results.

pulsate due to layers of increased opacity caused by partial ionization. The
increased opacity blocks the energy flux to the surface of the stars which
causes the layers to rise and the opacity to drop. This cyclical behavior makes
the star act as a heat engine and the star will thus pulsate. For beta Cep and
SPB stars the increased opacity is believed to be caused by partial ionization
of iron and these stars should therefore contain non-insignificant quantities
of the metal. A good test of this theory is to search for beta Cep and SPB
stars in low-metallicity environments. If no stars are found the theory is
supported, but on the other hand if a substantial number of beta Cep and SPB

solutions needed. With a growing number of identified beta Cep and SPB stars in

standard critical phenomena, analogy so useful to understand the zero

to a rounding of the depinning transition and compute the corresponding
exponent. In addition, using a novel algorithm it is possible to study
precisely the behavior close to depinning, and to show that the commonly
accepted analogy of the depinning with a critical phenomenon does not fully
hold, since no divergent lengthscale exists in the steady state properties of
the line below the depinning threshold.

of the 8-charge STU black hole of N=2 supergravity, both of which are given by
the [SL(2)]^3 invariant hyperdeterminant, a quantity first introduced by Cayley
in 1845. There are further relationships between the attractor mechanism and
local distillation protocols. At the microscopic level, the black holes are
described by intersecting D3-branes whose wrapping around the six compact
dimensions T^6 provides the string-theoretic interpretation of the charges and
we associate the three-qubit basis vectors, |ABC> (A,B,C=0 or 1), with the
corresponding 8 wrapping cycles. The black hole/qubit correspondence extends to
the 56 charge N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits
where the measure is provided by Cartan's E_7 supset [SL(2)]^7 invariant. The
qubits are naturally described by the seven vertices ABCDEFG of the Fano plane,
which provides the multiplication table of the seven imaginary octonions,
reflecting the fact that E_7 has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra.
This in turn provides a novel imaginary octonionic interpretation of the 56=7 x
8 charges of N=8: the 24=3 x 8 NS-NS charges correspond to the three imaginary
quaternions and the 32=4 x 8 R-R to the four complementary imaginary octonions.
N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five dimensions are also related to the

(GRBs) afterglows, a phase of shallow decline of the flux in the X-ray and
optical lightcurves. This behaviour is typically attributed to energy injection
into the burst ejecta. At some point this phase ends, resulting in a break in
the lightcurve, which is commonly interpreted as the cessation of the energy
injection. In a few cases, however, while breaks in the X-ray lightcurve are
observed, optical emission continues its slow flux decline. This behaviour
suggests a more complex scenario. In this paper, we present a model that
invokes a double component outflow, in which narrowly collimated ejecta are
responsible for the X-ray emission while a broad outflow is responsible for the
optical emission. The narrow component can produce a jet break in the X-ray
lightcurve at relatively early times, while the optical emission does not break
due to its lower degree of collimation. In our model both components are
subject to energy injection for the whole duration of the follow-up
observations. We apply this model to GRBs with chromatic breaks, and we show
how it might change the interpretation of the GRBs canonical lightcurve. We
also study our model from a theoretical point of view, investigating the
possible configurations of frequencies and the values of GRB physical
parameters allowed in our model.

X-rays contribute 10% of the bolometric luminosity and radiation at the
Eddington limit. Iron emission lines are common in the X-ray spectra of many
AGN, but the observed spectra appear to rule out strong emission lines in 3C

support a picture where our line of sight intersects a relativistic jet.

symmetry breaking. The meson spectrum exhibits Zeeman splitting and
characteristic GMOR relation. The second topic examines thermal properties of
the dual gauge theory. The third topic studies the phase structure of the
finite temperature dual gauge theory in the presence of magnetic field. A phase
diagram of the theory is obtained and the meson spectrum is explored. The
fourth topic studies the addition of an external electric field. The observed
effect is dissociation of the bound quarks, favoring the meson melting, the
dissociation of mesons corresponds to an insulator/conductor phase transition.
The fifth topic studies the addition of an R-charge chemical potential via
brane probing of the spinning D3-brane geometry. The corresponding phase
diagram is obtained. The chemical potential favors the dissociation of mesons.
The last topic explores universal properties of gauge theories dual to the
Dp/Dq system. A universal discrete self-similar behavior associated to the

strongly affects the qubit dynamics, and leads to decoherence. In quantum
information processing with solid state qubits, decoherence significantly
limits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully
understand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review we discuss
how decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid state
qubits, namely, spin-qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the
qubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by
confining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. Superconducting
devices show quantum behavior at low temperatures, and the qubit is encoded in
the two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit. The electron spin in
a quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted
relaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, and a
(non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum
dot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction. In a
superconducting qubit, decoherence takes place as a result of fluctuations in
the control parameters, such as bias currents, applied flux, and bias voltages,
and via losses in the dissipative circuit elements.

anticipated correlated multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
using Swift's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space
Telescope's (GLAST) Burst Monitor (GLAST-GBM), resulting in joint spectral
fits, including characteristic photon energy (Epeak) values, for a conservative
annual estimate of ~30 GRBs. The addition of BAT's spectral response will (i)
complement in-orbit calibration efforts of GBM's detector response matrices,
(ii) augment GLAST's low energy sensitivity by increasing the ~20-100 keV
effective area, (iii) facilitate ground-based follow-up efforts of GLAST GRBs
by increasing GBM's source localization precision, and (iv) help identify a
subset of non-triggered GRBs discovered via off-line GBM data analysis. Such
multi-wavelength correlative analyses, which have been demonstrated by
successful joint-spectral fits of Swift-BAT GRBs with other higher energy
detectors such as Konus-WIND and Suzaku-WAM, would enable the study of
broad-band spectral and temporal evolution of prompt GRB emission over three
energy decades, thus potentially increasing the science return without placing
additional demands upon mission resources throughout their contemporaneous
orbital tenure over the next decade.

introduced by H. Weyl and recently revisited by P. Mannheim and D. Kazanas.
Unlike past similar attempts our approach is a purely kinematical application
of the conformal symmetry to the Universe, through a critical reanalysis of
fundamental astrophysical observations, such as the cosmological redshift and
others. As a result of this novel approach we obtain a closed-form expression
for the cosmic scale factor R(t) and a revised interpretation of the space-time
coordinates usually employed in cosmology. New fundamental cosmological
parameters are introduced and evaluated. This emerging new cosmology does not
seem to possess any of the controversial features of the current standard
model, such as the presence of dark matter, dark energy or of a cosmological
constant, the existence of the horizon problem or of an inflationary phase.
Comparing our results with current conformal cosmologies in the literature, we
note that our kinematic cosmology is equivalent to conformal gravity with a
cosmological constant at late (or early) cosmological times. The cosmic scale
factor and the evolution of the Universe are described in terms of several
dimensionless quantities, among which a new cosmological variable delta emerges
as a natural cosmic time. The mathematical connections between all these
quantities are described in details and a relationship is established with the
original kinematic cosmology by L. Infeld and A. Schild. The mathematical
foundations of our kinematical conformal cosmology will need to be checked
against current astrophysical experimental data, before this new model can
become a viable alternative to the standard theory.

to compute stationary states of fluid motions, particularly those driven or
modulated by external forces. Standard LBM, being explicit time-marching in
nature, requires a long time to attain steady state convergence, particularly
at low Mach numbers due to the disparity in characteristic speeds of
propagation of different quantities. In this paper, we present a preconditioned
generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) with forcing term to accelerate
steady state convergence to flows driven by external forces. The use of
multiple relaxation times in the GLBE allows enhancement of the numerical
stability. Particular focus is given in preconditioning external forces, which
can be spatially and temporally dependent. In particular, correct forms of
moment-projections of source/forcing terms are derived such that they recover
preconditioned Navier-Stokes equations with non-uniform external forces. As an
illustration, we solve an extended system with a preconditioned lattice kinetic
equation for magnetic induction field at low magnetic Prandtl numbers, which
imposes Lorentz forces on the flow of conducting fluids. Computational studies,
particularly in three-dimensions, for canonical problems show that the number
of time steps needed to reach steady state is reduced by orders of magnitude
with preconditioning. In addition, the preconditioning approach resulted in
significantly improved stability characteristics when compared with the
corresponding single relaxation time formulation.

by fermionic quasiparticle excitations, we identified an ""emergent"" local
$U(1)^N$ symmetry in momentum space for an $N$-band model. For a large class of
models, including all one-band and two-band models, we found that the
time-reversal and chiral symmetry breaking can be described by the $U(1)^N$
gauge theory associated with this emergent local $U(1)^N$ symmetry. This
conclusion enables the classification of the time-reversal symmetry-breaking
states as types I and II, depending on the type of accompanying spatial
symmetry breaking. The properties of each class are studied. In particular, we
show that the states breaking both time-reversal and chiral symmetries are
described by spontaneously generated Berry phases. We also show examples of the
time-reversal symmetry-breaking phases in several different microscopically

mean-field approximation. The fermionic nematic phase with time-reversal

described by a single exponential distribution. On the other hand, the $p_{T}$
spectra from $p+p$, $d$+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions show power-law tails
at intermediate and high $p_{T}$ and are described better by Levy

centrality and colliding energy is in contradiction with expectations from
models having kaon coalescence as the dominant mechanism for $\phi$ production

with a model based on the recombination of thermal $s$ quarks up to $p_{T}\sim

modification factor, $R_{dAu}$, for the $\phi$ meson increases above unity at

""window length"". In the theory of universal coding, the code of the $x_{t}$
depends on source ststistics estimated by the window, in the problem of
predicting, each letter $x_{t}$ is predicted using information of the window,
etc. After that the letter $x_{t}$ is included in the window on the right,
while $x_{t-w}$ is removed from the window. It is the sliding window scheme.
This scheme has two merits: it allows one i) to estimate the source statistics
quite precisely and ii) to adapt the code in case of a change in the source'
statistics. However this scheme has a defect, namely, the necessity to store
the window (i.e. the word $x_{t-w}... x_{t-1})$ which needs a large memory size
for large $w$. A new scheme named ""the Imaginary Sliding Window (ISW)"" is
constructed. The gist of this scheme is that not the last element $x_{t-w}$ but
rather a random one is removed from the window. This allows one to retain both
merits of the sliding window as well as the possibility of not storing the
window and thus significantly decreasing the memory size.

tracking algorithm to the series of full-disc Dopplergrams obtained by
Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard the SOHO satelite. The dominant structure
recorded in Dopplergrams is the supergranulation. Under the assumtion that the
supergranules are carried by the flow field of the larger scale, we study
properties of this underlying velocity field. We perform comparative tests with
synthetic data with known properties and with results of the time-distance
helioseismology with a great success. A few case studies are shown to
demonstrate the performance of the method. We believe that tracking of
supergranules makes a perfect sense when studying the large-scale flows in the
solar photosphere. The method we demonstrate is suitable to detect large-scale
velocity field with effective resolution of 60"" and random error of 15 m/s. We
believe that our method may provide a powerful tool for studies related to the
dynamic behaviour of plasmas in the solar photosphere.

best manifestation of the potential of oxide electronics.

superconformal Chern-Simons theory coupled with U(N) \times U(N) bi-fundamental
matter fields. Especially, time evolutions of fuzzy spheres are discussed for
both massless and massive cases. For the massive case, there are a variety of
solutions having different behaviors according to the value of the mass. In
addition to the time-dependent solutions, we analyze non-BPS static solutions
which represent parallel M5/M5 or M5/anti-M5-branes suspended by multiple
M2-branes. These solutions are similar to the fundamental strings connecting
two parallel (anti) Dp-branes in perturbative string theory. A moving M5-brane
and domain wall solutions with constant velocity that are obtained by the
Lorentz boost of the known BPS solutions are briefly addressed.

Assuming space fluctuations of the order of the Planck length and the size of
the universe as the corresponding localization length for the background
radiation, we obtain the exponent (close to unity) in the power law
relationship between these quantities. This suggests that the role of Anderson
localization is not negligible at cosmological scales.

to price and trade a non-replicable contingent claim. Assuming that the agents
are utility maximizers, we propose a transaction price which is a result of the
minimization of a convex combination of their utility differences. We call this
price the risk sharing price, we prove its existence for a large family of
utility functions and we state some of its properties. As an example, we
analyze extensively the case where both agents report exponential utility.
