temperature (Tc) of LaFeAsO, LaFeAs(O0.5F0.5) and LaFeAs(O0.89F0.11) samples.
In-situ resistance measurements under high pressure showed that the Tc of these
three compounds increases with pressure initially, reaches a maximum value and
then decreases with further increasing pressure, although the Tc at ambient
pressure are different. The onset Tc of LaFeAsO is ~50 K at 1.5 GPa, which is
the highest record in La-based oxypnicited system. The significant change in Tc
induced by pressure is attributed to the orbital degeneracy and the electron
density of state at the Fermi level.

system composed of a quantum dot connected to two leads by solving the equation
of motion. The decoherence and the relaxation of the system caused by the gate
voltage noise and electron-phonon scattering are investigated. In order to take
account of the strong correlation of the electrons in this system, the
quasi-exact wave functions are calculated using an improved matrix product
states algorithm. This algorithm enables us to calculate the wave functions of
the ground state and the low lying excited states with satisfied accuracy and
thus enables us to study the kinetics of the system more effectively. It is
found that although both of these two mechanisms are proportional to the
electron number operator in the dot, the kinetics are quite different. The
noise induced decoherence is much more effective than the energy relaxation,
while the energy relaxation and decoherence time are of the same order for the
electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, the noise induced decoherence increases
with the lowering of the dot level, but the relaxation and decoherence due to
the electron-phonon scattering decrease.

anti-plane motions of an elastic layer bonded to an elastic half-space.
Similarly, Stoneley waves are interfacial waves in bonded contact of dissimilar
elastic half-spaces, when the displacements are in the plane of the solids. It
is shown that in slow sliding, long wavelength Love and Stoneley waves are
destabilized by friction. Friction is assumed to have a positive instantaneous
logarithmic dependence on slip rate and a logarithmic rate weakening behavior
at steady-state.
  Long wavelength instabilities occur generically in sliding with rate- and
state-dependent friction, even when an interfacial wave does not exist. For
slip at low rates, such instabilities are quasi-static in nature, i.e., the
phase velocity is negligibly small in comparison to a shear wave speed. The
existence of an interfacial wave in bonded contact permits an instability to
propagate with a speed of the order of a shear wave speed even in slow sliding,
indicating that the quasi-static approximation is not a valid one in such
problems.

Such models can ideally inform our understanding of human behavior. We may see
the development of computational models of emotion as a core research focus

showed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly

emotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the
dependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of

messages are confidential. We consider the $M \times N$ network where all
messages are secured and show that N(M-1)/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom can be
achieved. Secondly, we show that if messages from only M-1 transmitters are
confidential, then MN/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom can be achieved meaning that
there is no loss of degrees of freedom because of secrecy constraints. We also
consider the achievable secure degrees of freedom under a more conservative
secrecy constraint. We require that messages from any subset of transmitters
are secure even if other transmitters are compromised, i.e., messages from the
compromised transmitter are revealed to the unintended receivers. We also study
the achievable secure degrees of freedom of the K user Gaussian interference
channel under two different secrecy constraints where 1/2 secure degrees of
freedom per message can be achieved. The achievable scheme in all cases is
based on random binning combined with interference alignment.

radio emission with unusual properties. In addition, their spin down rates
during outburst show opposite trends, which so far has no explanation. Here, we
extend our quark-nova model for AXPs to include transient AXPs, in which the
outbursts are caused by transient accretion events from a Keplerian (iron-rich)
degenerate ring. For a ring with inner and outer radii of 23.5 km and 26.5 km,
respectively, our model gives a good fit to the observed X-ray outburst from
XTE J1810-197 and the behavior of temperature, luminosity, and area of the two
X-ray blackbodies with time. The two blackbodies in our model are related to a
heat front (i.e. Bohm diffusion front) propagating along the ring's surface and
an accretion hot spot on the quark star surface. Radio pulsations in our model
are caused by dissipation at the light cylinder of magnetic bubbles, produced
near the ring during the X-ray outburst. The delay between X-ray peak emission
and radio emission in our model is related to the propagation time of these
bubbles to the light cylinder. We predict a ~1 year and ~1 month delay for XTE
J1810-197 and 1E 1547.0-5408, respectively. The observed flat spectrum, erratic
pulse profile, and the pulse duration are all explained in our model as a
result of X-point reconnection events induced by the dissipation of the bubbles
at the light cylinder. The spin down rate of the central quark star can either
increase or decrease depending on how the radial drift velocity of the magnetic
islands changes with distance from the central star. We suggest an evolutionary
connection between transient AXPs and typical AXPs in our model.

heights of the restricted solid-on-solid models. In the continuum scaling
limit, these models are described by rational conformal field theories, namely
the minimal models M(p,p') for suitable p, p'. More generally, as in stochastic
Loewner evolution (SLE_kappa), one can consider observables related to nonlocal
degrees of freedom such as paths or boundaries of clusters. This leads to
fractal dimensions or geometric exponents related to values of conformal
dimensions not found among the finite sets of values allowed by the rational
minimal models. Working in the context of a loop gas with loop fugacity beta =
-2 cos(4 pi/kappa), we use Monte Carlo simulations to measure the fractal
dimensions of various geometric objects such as paths and the generalizations
of cluster mass, cluster hull, external perimeter and red bonds. Specializing
to the case where the SLE parameter kappa = 4p'/p is rational with p < p', we
argue that the geometric exponents are related to conformal dimensions found in
the infinitely extended Kac tables of the logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p').
These theories describe lattice systems with nonlocal degrees of freedom. We
present results for critical dense polymers LM(1,2), critical percolation
LM(2,3), the logarithmic Ising model LM(3,4), the logarithmic tricritical Ising
model LM(4,5) as well as LM(3,5). Our results are compared with rigourous
results from SLE_kappa, with predictions from theoretical physics and with
other numerical experiments. Throughout, we emphasize the relationships between

to overcome this problem and improve the performance of secure communications.
In particular, a decode-and-forward (DF) based cooperative protocol is
considered, and the objective is to design the system for secrecy capacity
maximization or transmit power minimization. System design for the DF-based
cooperative protocol is first studied by assuming the availability of global
channel state information (CSI). For the case of one eavesdropper, an iterative
scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal solution for the problem of transmit
power minimization. For the case of multiple eavesdroppers, the problem of
secrecy capacity maximization or transmit power minimization is in general
intractable. Suboptimal system design is proposed by adding an additional
constraint, i.e., the complete nulling of signals at all eavesdroppers, which
yields simple closed-form solutions for the aforementioned two problems. Then,
the impact of imperfect CSI of eavesdroppers on system design is studied, in
which the ergodic secrecy capacity is of interest.

experiment and theory. Theoretically, two factorization approaches have been
proposed. One is by using transverse-momentum-dependent factorization and the
asymmetry comes from the so called Sivers function. Another is by using
collinear factorization where the nonperturbative effect is parameterized by a
twist-3 hadronic matrix element. However, the factorized formulas for the
asymmetries in the two approaches are derived at hadron level formally by
diagram expansion, where one works with various parton density matrices of
hadrons. If the two factorizations hold, they should also hold at parton level.
We examine this for Drell-Yan processes by replacing hadrons with partons. By
calculating the asymmetry, Sivers function and the twist-3 matrix element at
nontrivial leading order of $\alpha_s$, we find that we can reproduce the
result of the transverse-momentum-dependent factorization. But we can only
verify the result of the collinear factorization partly. Two formally derived
relations between Sivers function and the twist-3 matrix element are also
examined with negative results.

quasi-two-dimensional metals around the antiferrromagnetic (AF) quantum
critical point (QCP) are investigated by using the self-consistent
renormalization theory for SF and the strong coupling theory for SC. We
introduce a parameter y0 as a measure for the distance from the AFQCP which is
approximately proportional to (x-xc), x being the electron (e) or hole (h)
doping concentration to the half-filled band and xc being the value at the
AFQCP. We present phase diagrams in the T-y0 plane including contour maps of
the AF correlation length and AF and SC transition temperatures TN and Tc,
respectively. The Tc curve is dome-shaped with a maximum at around the AFQCP.
The calculated one-electron spectral density shows a pseudogap in the
high-density-of-states region near (pi,0) below around a certain temperature T*
and gives a contour map at the Fermi energy reminiscent of the Fermi arc. These
results are discussed in comparison with e- and h-doped high-Tc cuprates.

obtained from the non-Hermitian effective Hamilton operator $H_{\rm eff}$
appearing in the internal part due to the coupling to the external part. As
well known, additional so-called cut-off poles of the $S$-matrix appear,
generally, due to the truncation of the potential. We study the question of
spurious $S$ matrix poles in the framework of the Feshbach formalism. The
numerical analysis is performed for exactly solvable potentials with a finite

Bargmann-type potentials to accept resonance states. Our calculations
demonstrate that the poles of the $S$ matrix obtained by using the Feshbach

character of the scaling law is illustrated with simple marked renewal
processes, built by definition with no correlations. Whereas processes with a

towards a Poisson process in the limit of very high sizes, processes without a
finite mean tend to another class of distributions, characterized by double

perturbations of AdS4 black holes. Special emphasis is placed on the effective
Schrodinger problems for axial and polar perturbations that realize
supersymmetric partner potential barriers on the half-line. Using the
holographic renormalization method, we compute the energy-momentum tensor for
perturbations satisfying arbitrary boundary conditions at spatial infinity and
discuss some aspects of the problem in the hydrodynamic representation. It is
also observed in this general framework that the energy-momentum tensor of
black hole perturbations and the energy momentum tensor of the gravitational
Chern-Simons action (known as Cotton tensor) exhibit an axial-polar duality
with respect to appropriately chosen supersymmetric partner boundary conditions
on the effective Schrodinger wave-functions. This correspondence applies to
perturbations of very large AdS4 black holes with shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio equal to 1/4\pi, thus providing a dual graviton description of
their hydrodynamic modes. We also entertain the idea that the purely
dissipative modes of black hole hydrodynamics may admit Ricci flow description
in the non-linear regime.
