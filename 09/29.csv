been often observed. Here, we investigate the effect of mass flows on the
collective fast and slow nonadiabatic magnetoacoustic wave modes supported by
systems of prominence threads. Prominence fine-structures are modeled as
parallel, homogeneous and infinite cylinders embedded in a coronal environment.
The magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the axis of threads.
Configurations of identical and nonidentical threads are both explored. We
apply the T-matrix theory of acoustic scattering to obtain the oscillatory
frequency and the eigenfunctions of linear magnetosonic disturbances. We find
that the existence of wave modes with a collective dynamics, i.e. those that
produce significant perturbations in all threads, is only possible when the
Doppler-shifted individual frequencies of threads are very similar. This can be
only achieved for very particular values of the plasma physical conditions and
flow velocities within threads.

description of their observed prompt emission and afterglows. Simple as they
are, the two mechanisms and the burst environment generate the rich structure
of the light curves at all frequencies and times. This is demonstrated for 33
selected Swift LGRBs and XRFs, which are well sampled from early until late
time and faithfully represent the entire diversity of the broad-band light
curves of Swift LGRBs and XRFs. Their prompt gamma-ray and X-ray emission is
dominated by ICS of `glory' light. During their fast decline phase, ICS is
taken over by SR, which dominates their broad-band afterglow. The pulse shape
and spectral evolution of the gamma-ray peaks and the early-time X-ray flares,
and even the delayed optical `humps' in XRFs, are correctly predicted. The
`canonical' and non-canonical X-ray light curves and the chromatic behaviour of
the broad-band afterglows are well reproduced. In particular, in canonical
X-ray light curves, the initial fast decline and rapid softening of the prompt
emission, the transition to the plateau phase, the subsequent gradual
steepening of the plateau to an asymptotic power-law decay, and the transition
from chromatic to achromatic behaviour of the light curves agrees well with
those predicted by the CB model. The Swift early-time data on XRF 060218 are
inconsistent with a black-body emission from a shock break-out through a

both the adjacency matrix and the normalized Laplacian matrix we identify the
spectral properties which characterize the mesoscopic structure of sparse
cyclic graphs and trees. The minimally connected nodes, clustering, and the
average connectivity affect the central part of the spectrum. The number of
distinct modules leads to an extra peak at the lower part of the Laplacian
spectrum in cyclic graphs. Such a peak does not occur in the case of
topologically distinct tree-subgraphs connected on a tree. Whereas the

along the chains on the tree for the eigenvector components associated with the

simulations of the random walk on several types of networks. Our results for
the distribution of return-time of the walk to the origin (autocorrelator)

temperature decoherence effects in a quantum condensate, is assigned to a
Feshbach resonance (called also shape resonance) in the exchange-like interband
pairing. The resonance is switched on by tuning the chemical potential at an
electronic topological transition (ETT) near a band edge, where the Fermi
surface topology of one of the subbands changes from 1D to 2D topology. We show
that the tuning is realized by changing i) the misfit strain between the
superconducting planes and the spacers ii) the charge density and iii) the
disorder. The system is at the verge of a catastrophe i.e. near a structural
and magnetic phase transition associated with the stripes (analogous to the 1/8
stripe phase in cuprates) order to disorder phase transition. Fine tuning of
both the chemical potential and the disorder pushes the critical temperature Ts
of this phase transition to zero giving a quantum critical point. Here the
quantum lattice and magnetic fluctuations promote the Feshbach resonance of the
exchange-like anisotropic pairing. This superconducting phase that resists to
the attacks of temperature is shown to be controlled by the interplay of the
hopping energy between stripes and the quantum fluctuations. The
superconducting gaps in the multiple Fermi surface spots reported by the recent

for modern telescopes so that the immediate surroundings of the star are still
poorly known. We study the close surroundings of the star (2 to 25 arcsec) by
means of adaptive optics and coronographic device in the near-infrared, using
the ESO/ADONIS system. The resulting high contrast images in the JHKs bands
have a resolution of ~ 0.2 arcsec and limiting apparent magnitude ranging from
mK = 9.5 at 3 arcsec, from Sirius-A to mK = 13.1 at 10 arcsec. These are the
first and deepest images of the Sirius system in this infrared range. From
these observations, accurate infrared photometry of the Sirius-B white dwarf
companion is obtained. The JH magnitudes of Sirius-B are found to agree with
expectations for a DA white dwarf of temperature (T=25000K) and gravity (log(g)
= 8.5), consistent with the characteristics determined from optical
observations. However, a small, significant excess is measurable for the K
band, similar to that detected for ""dusty"" isolated white dwarfs harbouring
suspected planetary debris. The possible existence of such circumstellar
material around Sirius-B has still to be confirmed by further observations.
These deep images allow us to search for small but yet undetected companions to
Sirius. Apart from Sirius-B, no other source is detected within the total 25
arcsec field. The minimum detectable mass is around 10 MJup inside the
planetary limit, indicating that an extrasolar planet at a projected distance
of ~ 25 AU from Sirius would have been detected (abridged abstract).

noncommuting variables and evaluate these functions on sets of matrices of all
dimensions; we call such situations dimension-free. These types of functions
have recently been used in the study of dimension-free linear system
engineering problems.
  In this paper we characterize NC analytic maps that send dimension-free
matrix balls to dimension-free matrix balls and carry the boundary to the
boundary; such maps we call ""NC ball maps"". We find that up to normalization,
an NC ball map is the direct sum of the identity map with an NC analytic map of
the ball into the ball. That is, ""NC ball maps"" are very simple, in contrast to
the classical result of D'Angelo on such analytic maps over C. Another
mathematically natural class of maps carries a variant of the noncommutative
distinguished boundary to the boundary, but on these our results are limited.
  We shall be interested in several types of noncommutative balls, conventional
ones, but also balls defined by constraints called Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMI). What we do here is a small piece of the bigger puzzle of understanding
how LMIs behave with respect to noncommutative change of variables.

shortest path length on the number of nodes. In this paper, we investigate this
dependence in the residue contact networks of proteins in native structures,
and show that the networks are not SWN but FN. FN is generally characterized by
several dimensions. Among them, we focus on three dimensions; the network
topological dimension $D_c$, the fractal dimension $D_f$, and the spectral
dimension $D_s$. We find that proteins universally yield $D_c \approx 1.9$,
$D_f \approx 2.5$ and $Ds \approx 1.3$. These values are in surprisingly good
coincidence with those in three dimensional critical percolation cluster. Hence
the residue contact networks in the protein native structures belong to the
universality class of three dimensional percolation cluster. The criticality is
relevant to the ambivalent nature of the protein native structures, i.e., the
coexistence of stability and instability, both of which are necessary for a
protein to function as a molecular machine or an allosteric enzyme.

recovery of a sparse signal from noisy random projections of the signal. We
consider two types of noise models, input noise, where noise enters before the
random projection; and output noise, where noise enters after the random
projection. Sign pattern recovery involves the estimation of sign pattern of a
sparse signal. Our idea is to pretend that no noise exists and solve the
noiseless $\ell_1$ problem, namely, $\min \|\beta\|_1 ~ s.t. ~ y=G \beta$ and
quantizing the resulting solution. We show that the quantized solution
perfectly reconstructs the sign pattern of a sufficiently sparse signal.
Specifically, we show that the sign pattern of an arbitrary k-sparse,
n-dimensional signal $x$ can be recovered with $SNR=\Omega(\log n)$ and
measurements scaling as $m= \Omega(k \log{n/k})$ for all sparsity levels $k$
satisfying $0< k \leq \alpha n$, where $\alpha$ is a sufficiently small
positive constant. Surprisingly, this bound matches the optimal
\emph{Max-Likelihood} performance bounds in terms of $SNR$, required number of
measurements, and admissible sparsity level in an order-wise sense. In contrast
to our results, previous results based on LASSO and Max-Correlation techniques
either assume significantly larger $SNR$, sublinear sparsity levels or
restrictive assumptions on signal sets. Our proof technique is based on noisy
perturbation of the noiseless $\ell_1$ problem, in that, we estimate the
maximum admissible noise level before sign pattern recovery fails.

real algebraic varieties in the space of all continuous maps. For a certain
class of real algebraic varieties, which include real projective spaces, it is
well known that the space of real algebraic maps is a dense subset of the space
of all continuous maps. Our first result shows that, for this class of

restrict the class of varieties to real projective spaces. In this case, the

the terms of the filtration approximate closer and closer the homotopy type of
the space of continuous mappings as the degree increases. We prove this and

pc of the Galaxy. In particular, we modeled the interactions between pairs of
$4000 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ black holes as they orbit a central blac k hole of mass
$4 \times 10^6 {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The simulations performed assume a
Schwarzschild geometry and account for Chandrasekhar dynamical friction as well
as acceleration resulting from energy lost due to gravitational radiation.
  We found the branching ratio for one of the orbiting IBHs to merge with the
CBH was 0.95 and is independent of the inner IBH's initial eccentricity as well
as the rate of sinking. This, coupled with an infall rate of $\sim 10^7 $ yrs
for an IBH to drift into the Galactic center, results in an IBH-CBH merger
every $\lesssim 11$ Myrs. Lastly we found that the IBH-IBH-CBH triple body
system ``resets'' itself, in the sense that a system with an inner I BH with an
initially circular orbit generally left behind an IBH with a large
eccentricity, whereas a system in which the inner IBH had a high eccentricity
($e_0 \sim 0.9$) usually left a remnant with low eccentricity. Branching ratios

of homogeneous cold inflaton into excitations of other fields. This process,

to be studied numerically. This paper presents a new code for simulating scalar
field dynamics in expanding universe written for that purpose. Compared to
available alternatives, it significantly improves both the speed and the
accuracy of calculations, and is fully instrumented for 3D visualization. We
reproduce previously published results on preheating in simple chaotic
inflation models, and further investigate non-linear dynamics of the inflaton
decay. Surprisingly, we find that the fields do not want to thermalize quite
the way one would think. Instead of directly reaching equilibrium, the
evolution appears to be stuck in a rather simple but quite inhomogeneous state.
In particular, one-point distribution function of total energy density appears
to be universal among various two-field preheating models, and is exceedingly
well described by a lognormal distribution. It is tempting to attribute this
state to scalar field turbulence.

Our investigation indicates that the contact conductance depends sensitively on

to one carbon atom, the contact conductance vanishes at the Dirac point if the
two carbon atoms coupling to the two leads belong to the same sublattice of
graphene. We find that such a feature arises from the chirality of the Dirac
electron in graphene. Such a chirality associated with conductance zero
disappears when a quantum wire couples to multiple carbon atoms. The general
result irrelevant to the coupling configuration is that the contact conductance
decays rapidly with the increase of the distance between the two leads. In
addition, in the weak graphene-lead coupling limit, when the distance between
the two leads is much larger than the size of the graphene-lead contact areas
and the incident electron energy is close to the Dirac point, the contact
conductance is proportional to the square of the product of the two
graphene-lead contact areas, and inversely proportional to the square of the

talking about something that does not match the previously announced talk. In
this respect, we believe that the organization of a workshop in the classical

reducing energy consumption in embedded and real-time systems. However,
traditional DVS algorithms have inherent limitations on their capability in
energy saving since they rarely take into account the actual application
requirements and often exploit fixed timing constraints of real-time tasks.
Taking advantage of application adaptation, an enhanced energy-aware feedback
scheduling (EEAFS) scheme is proposed, which integrates feedback scheduling
with DVS. To achieve further reduction in energy consumption over pure DVS
while not jeopardizing the quality of control, the sampling period of each
control loop is adapted to its actual control performance, thus exploring
flexible timing constraints on control tasks. Extensive simulation results are
given to demonstrate the effectiveness of EEAFS under different scenarios.
Compared with the optimal pure DVS scheme, EEAFS saves much more energy while
yielding comparable control performance.

for interfacing Scilab with several communication protocols including serial,

wireless communications. By exploiting cross-layer design, CLAFS adjusts the
sampling periods of control systems at the application layer based on

maximized through controlling the deadline miss ratio. Key design parameters of
the feedback scheduler are adapted to dynamic changes in the channel condition.
An event-driven invocation mechanism for the feedback scheduler is also

is achieved if we include the mass power spectrum. However, our analysis was
based on the ad hoc assumption that the interacting cosmological term is
strictly homogeneous. Now we perform a more complete analysis, by perturbing
such a term. Although our conclusions are still based on a particular, scale
invariant choice of the primordial spectrum of dark energy perturbations, we
show that a cosmological term decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter is
indeed disfavored as compared to the standard model.

give the entropies agreeing (at best) just for BPS black holes. The key

magnitude of length and time scales. A microscopic simulation covering all
those scales from the polymer segment to the inertial scale of turbulence seems
impossible within the foreseeable future. We propose a multiscale simulation
strategy to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of local Lagrangian
turbulent flow by matching two different simulation techniques, i. e. direct
numerical simulation for the flow as a whole, and the lattice Boltzmann method
coupled to polymer dynamics at the Kolmogorov dissipation scale. Local
turbulent flows sampled by Lagrangian tracer particles in the direct numerical
simulation are reproduced in the lattice Boltzmann model with a finer
resolution, by supplying the latter with both the correct initial condition as
well as the correct time-dependent boundary condition, sampled from the former.
When combined with a Molecular Dynamics simulation of a polymer chain in the
lattice Boltzmann model, it provides a strategy to simulate the \emph{passive}
dynamics of a polymer chain in a turbulent flow covering all those scales.
While this approach allows for a fairly realistic model of the macromolecule,
the back-coupling to the flow on the large scales is missing.

field with a high significance (26.7 sigma), and the discovery (4 sigma) of a
48"" long X-ray tail emanating from the point source. The X-ray spectra of both
the point source and the tail are well described with a single absorbed
powerlaw, and the tail is harder (powerlaw index Gamma = 0.14^{+0.59}_{-0.68})
than the point source (Gamma = 1.78^{+0.13}_{-0.11}). From this first detailed
spatial, spectral and timing X-ray analysis of CXO J172337.5-373442, and from a
plausible optical counterpart found from the archives, we conclude that this
source is either a Galactic High-Mass X-ray Binary with an X-ray jet or a
Galactic pulsar with its ""pulsar wind nebula"" seen as the X-ray tail. Although,
the currently available data are not enough to distinguish between these two
candidates with certainty, a detailed comparison of their known properties with
those of CXO J172337.5-373442 favours the latter type. If this identification
is correct, then the pulsar should be middle-aged or old, that has escaped from
its supernova remnant, and the X-ray tail should originate from the synchrotron
emission from either of the following locations: (1) a shocked region, or (2) a
jet emanating from the pulsar's magnetosphere.

network connectivity features in the Loop quantum gravity, we introduce a link
operator, and through extending the dynamical equation for the evolution of
quantum network posed by Ginestra Bianconi to an operator equation, we get the
solution of the link operator. This solution is relevant to the Hamiltonian of
the network, and then is related to the energy distribution of network nodes.
Showing that tremendous energy distribution induce huge curved space-time
network, may have space time condensation in high-energy nodes. For example, in
the black hole circumstances, quantum energy distribution is related to the
area, thus the eigenvalues of the link operator of the nodes can be related to
quantum number of area, and the eigenvectors are just the spin network states.
This reveals that the degree distribution of nodes for space-time network is
quantized, which can form the space-time network condensation. The black hole
is a sort of result of space-time network condensation, however there may be
more extensive space-time network condensation, for example, the universe

Alamouti is more sensitive to CFO and SFO. Moreover, we show that all studied
MIMO-OFDM schemes are sensitive to CFO when it is greater than 1% of
inter-carrier spacing. Their sensitivity due to SFO is less than that due to
CFO.

More precisely, we focus on three types of non-orthogonal schemes: the BLAST
scheme, the Linear Dispersion (LD) code and the Golden code, and we compare
their performances to that of Alamouti scheme. Using two receiving antennas, we
show that for moderate attenuation on the second antenna and high spectral
efficiency, Golden code outperforms other schemes. However, Alamouti scheme
presents the best performance for low spectral efficiency and equal received
powers or when one antenna is dramatically damaged. When three antennas are
used, we show that Golden code offers the highest robustness to power unbalance
at the receiving side

a one-photon photoassociation of ultracold cesium atoms in a manifold of

We were able to form about $10^5-10^6$ molecules per second in these low
vibrational levels of the ground state. This detection scheme could be
generalized to other molecular species for the systematic investigation of cold
molecule formation mechanisms.

M4_(2n+1)M model of membrane with 2n+1 fields. The latter gives simple analytic

support for the criteria of delamination. We illustrate this concept by the
analytic resolution of (0 deg, 90 deg)s in traction and give some results for
more complex stackings.

contains a leading single-derivative term, similar to the Shraiman-Siggia term
in the square lattice case, which gives rise to spirals in the staggered
magnetization. Depending on the values of the low-energy parameters, either a
homogeneous phase with four or a spiral phase with two filled hole pockets is
energetically favored. Unlike in the square lattice case, at leading order the
effective action has an accidental continuous spatial rotation symmetry.
Consequently, the spiral may point in any direction and is not necessarily
aligned with a lattice direction.
