find that the additional cooling due to the neutrino magnetic moments bring
about qualitative changes to the structure and evolution of stars in the mass
window 7 Msun < M < 18 Msun, rather than simply changing the time scales for
the burning. We describe some of the consequences of this modified evolution:
the shifts in the threshold masses for creating core-collapse supernovae and
oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs and the appearance of a new type of
supernova in which a partial carbon-oxygen core explodes within a massive star.
The resulting sensitivity to the magnetic moment is at the level of (2-4) *

We show that, in noncommutative (NC) spacetime, there always exists a
coordinate transformation to locally eliminate the electromagnetic force, which
is precisely the Darboux theorem in symplectic geometry. As a consequence, the
electromagnetism can be realized as a geometrical property of spacetime like
gravity. We show that the geometrization of the electromagnetic force in NC
spacetime is the origin of gravity, dubbed as the emergent gravity. We discuss
how the emergent gravity reveals a novel, radically different picture about the
origin of spacetime. In particular, the emergent gravity naturally explains the
dynamical origin of flat spacetime, which is absent in Einstein gravity. This
spacetime picture turns out to be crucial for a tenable solution of the
cosmological constant problem.

comprising 7311 near-infrared images taken regularly along the last four years
for the ALHAMBRA survey (J, H and Ks-bands), together with a more reduced
dataset of additional near-infrared images taken for the current study. In
addition we collected the information derived by the meteorological station at
the observatory during the last 10 years, together with the results from the
cloud sensor for the last ~2 years. We analyze the dependency of the
near-infrared night sky-brightness with the airmass and the seasons, studying
its origins and proposing a zenithal correction. A strong correlation is found
between the night sky-brightness in the Ks-band and the air temperature, with a
gradient of ~ -0.08 mag per 1 C degree. The typical (darkest) night
sky-brightness in the J, H and Ks-band are 15.95 mag (16.95 mag), 13.99 mag
(14.98 mag) and 12.39 mag (13.55 mag), respectively. These values show that
Calar Alto is as dark in the near-infrared as most of the other astronomical
astronomical sites in the world that we could compare with. Only Mauna Kea is
clearly darker in the Ks-band. The typical telescope seeing at the 3.5m is
~1.0"" when converted to the V-band, being only slightly larger than the
atmospheric seeing measured at the same time by the seeing monitor, ~0.9"".
Finally we estimate the fraction of useful time based on the relative humidity,
gust wind speed and presence of clouds. This fraction, ~72%, is very similar to
the one derived in Paper I, based on the fraction of time when the extinction
monitor is working.

Unfortunately, along these approaches the interpretation and the physical

The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we find that box-counting dimension in
face of finite resolution of space-time (generally implied by quantum gravity)
shows a simple way how both the qualitative and the quantitative features of
this effect can be understood. Second, considering two most interesting cases
of random and holographic fluctuations of the background space, we find that it

networks, and the main finding is that network throughput can be made to scale
linearly with the number of receive antennas nR even if each transmitting node
uses only a single antenna. This is in contrast to a large body of prior work
in single-user, multiuser, and ad hoc wireless networks that have shown linear
scaling is achievable when multiple receive and transmit antennas (i.e., MIMO
transmission) are employed, but that throughput increases logarithmically or
sublinearly with nR when only a single transmit antenna (i.e., SIMO
transmission) is used. The linear gain is achieved by using the receive degrees
of freedom to simultaneously suppress interference and increase the power of
the desired signal, and exploiting the subsequent performance benefit to
increase the density of simultaneous transmissions instead of the transmission
rate. This result is proven in the transmission capacity framework, which
presumes single-hop transmissions in the presence of randomly located
interferers, but it is also illustrated that the result holds under several
relaxations of the model, including imperfect channel knowledge, multihop
transmission, and regular networks (i.e., interferers are deterministically
located on grids).

information bits within $T$ hard delay deadline slots is considered assuming
that the underlying energy-bit cost function is a convex monomial. The
scheduling objective is to minimize the expected energy expenditure while
satisfying the deadline constraint based on information about the unserved
bits, channel state/statistics, and the remaining time slots to the deadline.
At each time slot, the scheduling decision is made without knowledge of future
channel state, and thus there is a tension between serving many bits when the
current channel is good versus leaving too many bits for the deadline. Under
the assumption that no other packet is scheduled concurrently and no outage is
allowed, we derive the optimal scheduling policy. Furthermore, we also
investigate the dual problem of maximizing the number of transmitted bits over
$T$ time slots when subject to an energy constraint.

linear combination that reveals one unit of new information) even if it does
not reveal an original packet immediately. Such ACKs enable a TCP-like
sliding-window approach to network coding. Our scheme has the nice property
that packet losses are essentially masked from the congestion control
algorithm. Our algorithm therefore reacts to packet drops in a smooth manner,
resulting in a novel and effective approach for congestion control over
networks involving lossy links such as wireless links. Our experiments show
that our algorithm achieves higher throughput compared to TCP in the presence

the mid-IR emission of closeby, well known PDRs. Focusing on the band and
continuum dust emissions, we follow their relative contributions and analyze
their variations in terms of abundance of dust populations. In order to
disentangle dust evolution and excitation effects, we use a dust emission model
that we couple to radiative transfer. Our dust model reproduces extinction and
emission of the standard interstellar medium that we represent with diffuse
high galactic latitude clouds called Cirrus. We take the properties of dust in
Cirrus as a reference to which we compare the dust emission from more excited
regions, namely the Horsehead and the reflection nebula NGC 2023 North. We show
that in both regions, radiative transfer effects cannot account for the
observed spectral variations. We interpret these variations in term of changes
of the relative abundance between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs,
mid-IR band carriers) and very small grains (VSGs, mid-IR continuum carriers).
We conclude that the PAH/VSG abundance ratio is 2.4 times smaller at the peak
emission of the Horsehead nebula than in the Cirrus case. For NGC2023 North
where spectral evolution is observed across the northern PDR, we conclude that
this ratio is ~5 times lower in the dense, cold zones of the PDR than in its
diffuse illuminated part where dust properties seem to be the same as in
Cirrus. We conclude that dust in PDRs seems to evolve from ""dense"" to ""diffuse""
properties at the small spatial scale of the dense illuminated ridge.

use it to estimate the first two harmonic moments, this then allows us to match
the same unconditional densities as the ones proved over $\Q$ by Kowalski,

old forms, to control. Finally we convert our estimates for the harmonic

general approach for establishing identifiability utilizing algebraic
arguments. A theorem of J. Kruskal for a simple latent-class model with finite
state space lies at the core of our results, though we apply it to a diverse
set of models. These include mixtures of both finite and nonparametric product
distributions, hidden Markov models and random graph mixture models, and lead
to a number of new results and improvements to old ones. In the parametric
setting, this approach indicates that for such models, the classical definition
of identifiability is typically too strong. Instead generic identifiability
holds, which implies that the set of nonidentifiable parameters has measure
zero, so that parameter inference is still meaningful. In particular, this
sheds light on the properties of finite mixtures of Bernoulli products, which
have been used for decades despite being known to have nonidentifiable
parameters. In the nonparametric setting, we again obtain identifiability only
when certain restrictions are placed on the distributions that are mixed, but

calculate various cosmic-shear and galaxy-galaxy-lensing statistics. We compare
the results from ray-tracing to semi-analytic predictions. We find: (i) The
linear approximation provides an excellent fit to cosmic-shear power spectra as
long as the actual matter power spectrum is used as input. Common fitting
formulae, however, strongly underestimate the cosmic-shear power spectra. Halo
models provide a better fit to cosmic shear-power spectra, but there are still
noticeable deviations. (ii) Cosmic-shear B-modes induced by Born corrections
and lens-lens coupling are at least three orders of magnitude smaller than
cosmic-shear E-modes. Semi-analytic extensions to the linear approximation
predict the right order of magnitude for the B-mode. Compared to the
ray-tracing results, however, the semi-analytic predictions may differ by a
factor two on small scales and also show a different scale dependence. (iii)
The linear approximation may under- or overestimate the galaxy-galaxy-lensing
shear signal by several percent due to the neglect of magnification bias, which
may lead to a correlation between the shear and the observed number density of
lenses. We conclude: (i) Current semi-analytic models need to be improved in
order to match the degree of statistical accuracy expected for future
weak-lensing surveys. (ii) Shear B-modes induced by corrections to the linear

combinations of critical amplitudes. We also form effective ratios of the

we show analytically that for the Potts model with a number of states $q\le 4$,
the effective ratio of the energy critical amplitudes always approaches unity
linearly with respect to the reduced temperature. This fact leads to the
prediction of relations among the amplitudes of correction-to-scaling terms of
the specific heat in the low- and high-temperature phases. It is a common
belief that the four-state Potts and the Baxter-Wu model belong to the same
universality class. At the same time, the critical behavior of the four-state
Potts model is modified by logarithmic corrections while that of the Baxter-Wu

gravitational wave recoil carries a retinue of bound stars - a ""hypercompact

about the merger histories of galaxies, the late evolution of binary black
holes, and the distribution of gravitational-wave kicks. We relate the
structural properties of HCSSs to the properties of their host galaxies, in two
regimes: collisional, i.e. short nuclear relaxation times; and collisionless,
i.e. long nuclear relaxtion times. HCSSs are expected to be similar in size and
luminosity to globular clustersbut in extreme cases their stellar mass can
approach that of UCDs. However they differ from all other classes of compact
stellar system in having very high internal velocities. We show that the kick
velocity is encoded in the velocity dispersion of the bound stars. Given a
large enough sample of HCSSs, the distribution of gravitational-wave kicks can
therefore be empirically determined. We combine a hierarchical merger algorithm
with stellar population models to compute the rate of production of HCSSs over
time and the probability of observing HCSSs in the local universe as a function
of their apparent magnitude, color, size and velocity dispersion, under two
assumptions about the star formation history prior to the kick. We predict that
roughly 100 should be detectable within 2 Mpc of the center of the Virgo

deeply embedded and drives an energetic molecular outflow. The source, UYSO1,
is located close to IRAS 07029-1215 at a distance of ~1 kpc. The
multi-wavelength observations resulted in the detection of a double
intermediate-mass protostar at the location of UYSO1. In addition to the
associated molecular outflow, with a projected size of 0.25 pc, two
intersecting near-infrared jets with projected sizes of 0.4 pc and 0.2 pc were
found. However, no infrared counterparts to the driving sources could be
detected in sensitive near- to far-infrared observations. In interferometric
millimeter observations, UYSO1 was resolved into two continuum sources with
high column densities and gas masses of 3.5 Mo and 1.2 Mo, with a linear
separation of 4200 AU. We report the discovery of a H2O maser toward one of the
two sources. The total luminosity is roughly estimated to be ~50 Lo, shared by
the two components, one of which is driving the molecular outflow that has a
dynamical timescale of less than a few thousand years. The jets of the two
individual components are not aligned. Submillimeter observations show that the
region lacks typical hot-core chemistry. We thus find two protostellar objects,
whose associated circumstellar and parent core masses are high enough to
suggest that they may evolve into intermediate-mass stars. This is corroborated
by their association with a very massive and energetic CO outflow, suggesting
high protostellar accretion rates. The short dynamical timescale of the
outflow, the pristine chemical composition of the cloud core and absence of hot
core tracers, the absence of detectable radio continuum emission, and the very
low protostellar luminosity argue for an extremely early evolutionary stage.

expanded line database, an improved escape probability formulism, and the
inclusion of dust grains, which can absorb line photons. Although the escape
probabilities formally depend on a complicated combination of optical depth in
the lines and in the dust grains, we show that the cooling rate including dust
is well approximated by the dust-free cooling rate multiplied by a simple
function of the dust optical depth. We apply the resultant cooling rate of a
dust-gas mixture to the case of a solar nebula shock pertinent to the formation
of chondrules, millimeter-sized melt droplets found in meteorites. Our aim is
to assess whether line cooling can be neglected in chondrule-forming shocks or
if it must be included. We find that for typical parameters, H2O line cooling
shuts off a few minutes past the shock front; line photons that might otherwise
escape the shocked region and cool the gas will be absorbed by dust grains.
During the first minute or so past the shock, however, line photons will cool
the gas at rates ~ 10,000 K/hr, dropping the temperature of the gas (and most
likely the chondrules within the gas) by several hundred K. Inclusion of H2O
line cooling therefore must be included in models of chondrule formation by
nebular shocks.

There is no doubt that the
expansion in powers of the two lightest quark masses does represent a very
useful tool for the analysis of the low energy structure. Concerning the
expansion in powers of m_s, however, the current situation leaves much to be
desired. While some of the lattice results indicate, for instance, that the
violations of the Okubo-Iizuka-Zweig rule in the quark condensate and in the
decay constants are rather modest, others point in the opposite direction. I am
confident that the dust will settle soon, so that the effective coupling
constants that govern the dependence of the various quantities of physical
interest on m_s can be determined, to next-to-next-to-leading order of the
chiral expansion.
  The range of validity of ChPT can be extended by means of dispersive methods.
The properties of the physical states occurring in the spectrum of QCD below
KKbar threshold can reliably be investigated on this basis. In particular, as
shown only rather recently, general principles of quantum field theory lead to
an exact formula that expresses the mass and width of resonances in terms of
observable quantities. The formula removes the ambiguities inherent in the

that a model similar to that proposed by Haehnelt, Steinmetz, & Rauch (2000),
which explains the incidence rate and kinematics of DLAs in the context of
$\Lambda$CDM models for structure formation, also reproduces the size
distribution of the new population of faint Ly alpha emitters for plausible
parameters. This lends further support to identification of the emitters with
the hitherto elusive population of DLA host galaxies. The observed incidence
rate of DLAs together with the observed space density and size distribution of
the emitters suggest a duty cycle of ~ 0.2 - 0.4 for the Ly alpha emission from
DLA host galaxies. We further show that Ly alpha cooling is expected to
contribute little to the Ly alpha emission for the majority of emitters. This
leaves centrally concentrated star formation at a rate of a few tenths
M_sun/yr, surrounded by extended Ly alpha halos with radii up to 30-50 kpc, as
the most plausible explanation for the origin of the emission. Both the
luminosity function of Ly alpha emission and the velocity width distribution of
low ionization absorption require that galaxies inside Dark Matter (DM) halos

of DLAs at z ~ 3, suggesting that energy and momentum input due to star
formation efficiently removes gas from these halos. Galaxies with DM halos with

used to approximate how massive a galaxy's halo is, very few individual
galaxies have direct measurements of their halo masses. We present a method to
directly estimate the total mass of a galaxy's dark halo using its system of
globular clusters. The link between globular cluster systems and halo masses is
independent of a galaxy's type and environment, in contrast to the relationship
between galaxy halo and stellar masses. This trend is expected in models where
globular clusters form in early, rare density peaks in the cold dark matter
density field and the epoch of reionisation was roughly coeval throughout the

that a galaxy's supermassive black hole mass and global X-ray luminosity are
directly proportional to their host dark halo masses, as inferred from our new

relativistic jets and shocks, e.g., gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), and microquasars commonly exhibit power-law emission spectra.
Recent PIC simulations of relativistic electron-ion (or electron-positron) jets
injected into a stationary medium show that particle acceleration occurs within
the downstream jet. In collisionless, relativistic shocks, particle (electron,
positron, and ion) acceleration is due to plasma waves and their associated
instabilities (e.g., the Weibel (filamentation) instability) created in the
shock region. The simulations show that the Weibel instability is responsible
for generating and amplifying highly non-uniform, small-scale magnetic fields.
These fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the jet
head. The resulting ""jitter"" radiation from deflected electrons has different
properties compared to synchrotron radiation, which assumes a uniform magnetic
field. Jitter radiation may be important for understanding the complex time
evolution and/or spectra in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets in general, and
supernova remnants.

scenarios - the tidal splitting of passing comets and the collisional
destruction of a satellite - rely on a high cometary flux in the past. In the
present paper we attempt to quantify the cometary flux during the Late Heavy
Bombardment (LHB) to assess the likelihood of both scenarios. Our analysis
relies on the so-called Nice model of the origin of the LHB (Tsiganis et al.,
2005; Morbidelli et al., 2005; Gomes et al., 2005) and on the size distribution
of the primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimals constrained in Charnoz &
Morbidelli (2007). We find that the cometary flux on Saturn during the LHB was
so high that both scenarios for the formation of Saturn rings are viable in
principle. However, a more detailed study shows that the comet tidal disruption
scenario implies that all four giant planets should have comparable ring
systems whereas the destroyed satellite scenario would work only for Saturn,
and perhaps Jupiter. This is because in Saturn\'s system, the synchronous orbit
is interior to the Roche Limit, which is a necessary condition for maintaining
a satellite in the Roche zone up to the time of the LHB. We also discuss the
apparent elimination of silicates from the ring parent body implied by the
purity of the ice in Saturn \' s rings. The LHB has also strong implications
for the survival of the Saturnian satellites: all satellites smaller than Mimas
would have been destroyed during the LHB, whereas Enceladus would have had from
40% to 70% chance of survival depending on the disruption model. In conclusion,
these results suggest that the LHB is the sweet moment for the formation of a
massive ring system around Saturn.

therefore required that can accurately describe a cluster's pressure profile
over a broad range of radii, from the core of the cluster out to a significant
fraction of the virial radius. In the analysis presented here, we fit a radial
pressure profile derived from simulations and detailed X-ray analysis of
relaxed clusters to SZA observations of three clusters with exceptionally high
quality X-ray data: A1835, A1914, and CL J1226.9+3332. From the joint analysis
of the SZ and X-ray data, we derive physical properties such as gas mass, total
mass, gas fraction and the intrinsic, integrated Compton y-parameter. We find
that parameters derived from the joint fit to the SZ and X-ray data agree well
with a detailed, independent X-ray-only analysis of the same clusters. In
particular, we find that, when combined with X-ray imaging data, this new
pressure profile yields an independent electron radial temperature profile that
is in good agreement with spectroscopic X-ray measurements.

linear decline from a modest peak absolute magnitude of about -17.4
(unfiltered), followed by a plateau at roughly -14.8 for more than 2yr.
Initially having a normal broad-lined spectrum superposed with sparse narrow
lines from the photoionized CSM, it quickly developed signs of strong CSM
interaction with a spectrum similar to that of SN1988Z. As the underlying
SNII-L faded, SN2005ip exhibited a rich high-ionization spectrum with a dense

active galactic nuclei. The line-profile evolution of SN 2005ip confirms that
dust formation caused its recently reported infrared excess, but these lines

of the disconnected diagrams is considered small and is typically ignored. We
aim to estimate nonperturbatively the size of the resulting error, which could
potentially affect the high precision calculations of the charmonium spectrum.
Following our work on the effects of the disconnected diagrams in unquenched
QCD presented at Lattice 2007, we study the same problem in the quenched case.
On dynamical ensembles the disconnected charmonium propagators contain light
modes which complicate the extraction of the signal at large distances. In the
fully quenched case, where there are no such light modes, the interpretation of
the signal is simplified. We present results from lattices with $a\approx 0.09$
fm and $a\approx 0.063$ fm.

magnitude, color, and size selection criteria, we identify a sample of 15
ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxy candidates within the ACS field. This is
comparable to the numbers of UCDs found within similar regions in more nearby
clusters (Virgo, Fornax, Hydra). We estimate circular half-light radii R_e,c
from 2-D Sersic and King model fits and apply an upper cutoff of 100pc for our
UCD selection. The selected galaxies have typical Sersic indices $n\approx1.5$,
while larger sources with R_e,c > 100pc are more nearly exponential, perhaps
indicating that the latter are dominated by background disk galaxies. Many of
the UCD candidates are surrounded by a faint ""fuzz"" of halo light, which may be
the remnants of stripped material, and there is some evidence for intrinsic
flattening of the UCDs themselves. An apparent separation in size between the
most compact UCDs with R_e,c < 17pc and larger ones with R_e,c > 40pc may hint
at different formation mechanisms. We do not find any M32 analogues in this
field. The colors of the UCD candidates span the range from blue to red
globular clusters, although the brightest ones are predominantly red. The UCD
candidates follow the flattened, elliptical distribution of the globular
clusters, which in turn follow the galaxy halo light, suggesting a common
evolution for these three components. Follow-up spectroscopy can determine
which candidates are truly members of Abell S0740 and how similar they are in
distribution to the globulars.

radiation in static, spherically-symmetric spacetimes by explicitly
incorporating a preferred family of frames. These frames correspond to a family
of observers tied to a locally static timelike Killing vector of the spacetime.
This formulation separates the role of the coordinates from the choice of
vacuum and thus provides a coordinate-independent formulation of the tunneling
method. In addition, it clarifies the nature of certain constants and their
relation to these preferred observers in the calculation of horizon
temperatures. We first use this formalism to obtain the expected temperature
for a static observer at finite radius in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We then
apply this formalism to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, where there is
no static observer with 4-velocity equal to the static timelike Killing vector.
It is shown that a preferred static observer, one whose trajectory is geodesic,
measures the lowest temperature from each horizon. Furthermore, this observer
measures horizon temperatures corresponding to the well-known Bousso-Hawking
normalization.

Qmax which is inherited from the convolutional code and the spatial

quantization on L_2(R_+). The various quantization schemes are in excellent
agreement for the highly excited states but differ for the low-lying states,
and the polymer spectrum is bounded below even when the Schrodinger spectrum is
not. We find as expected that for the antisymmetric boundary condition the
regularization of the potential is redundant: the polymer quantum theory is
well defined even with the unregularized potential and the regularization of
the potential does not significantly affect the spectrum.

luminosities, we obtain star formation rates (SFRs), and then specific SFRs
(SSFRs) dividing SFRs by stellar masses, which are derived from SED fitting to
BVRi'z'K photometry. It is found that sBzKs with higher stellar masses have
larger SFRs. A negative correlation is seen between stellar mass and SSFR,
which is consistent with the previous results for z~2 galaxies. This implies
that a larger growth of stellar mass occurs in less massive galaxies. In
addition, gas-phase oxygen abundances, 12+log(O/H), are derived from the ratio
of NII(lambda 6584) to Halpha using the N2 index method. We have found a
correlation between stellar mass and oxygen abundance in the sense that more
massive sBzKs tend to be more metal rich, which is qualitatively consistent
with the relation for UV-selected z~2 galaxies. However, the metallicity of the
sBzKs is ~0.2 dex higher than that of UV-selected galaxies with similar stellar
masses, which is significant considering the small uncertainties. The sBzKs in
our sample have redder R-K colors than the UV-selected galaxies. This galaxy
color-dependence in the oxygen abundance may be caused by older or dustier

Extending this probability axiom to the complex plane, we first attempt to find
a probability density by solving an appropriate conservation equation. The
characteristic curves of this conservation equation are found to be the same as
the complex paths of particles in the new representation. The boundary
condition in this case is that the extended probability density should agree
with the quantum probability rule along the real line. For the simple,
time-independent, one-dimensional problems worked out here, we find that a
conserved probability density can be derived from the velocity field of
particles, except in regions where the trajectories were previously suspected
to be nonviable. An alternative method to find this probability density in
terms of a trajectory integral, which is easier to implement on a computer and
useful for single particle solutions, is also presented. Most importantly, we
show, by using the complex extension of Schrodinger equation, that the desired
conservation equation can be derived from this definition of probability

upper bounds on the mass of the central supermassive black hole, MBH, for a
sample of 105 nearby galaxies (D<100Mpc) spanning a wide range of Hubble types
(E-Sc) and values of the central stellar velocity dispersion, sigma
(58-419km/s). For the vast majority of the objects the derived MBH upper limits
run parallel and above the well-known MBH-sigma relation independently of the
galaxy distance, suggesting that our nebular line-width measurements trace
rather well the nuclear gravitational potential. For values of sigma between 90
and 220km/s the 68% of our upper limits falls immediately above the MBH-sigma
relation without exceeding the expected MBH values by more than a factor 4.1.
No systematic trends or offsets are observed in this sigma range as a function
of the galaxy Hubble type or with respect to the presence of a bar. For 6 of
our 12 MBH upper limits with sigma<90km/s our line-width measurements are more
sensitive to the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential, either
due to the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster or because of a greater
distance compared to the other galaxies at the low-sigma end of the MBH-sigma
relation. Conversely, our MBH upper bounds appear to lie closer to the expected
MBH in the most massive elliptical galaxies with values of sigma above 220km/s.
Such a flattening of the MBH-sigma relation at its high-sigma end would appear
consistent with a coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies driven
by dry mergers, although better and more consistent measurements for sigma and
K-band luminosity are needed for these kind of objects before systematic
effects can be ruled out.

estimated earlier. This result is compatible with the existence of a dark
matter halo plus some degree of radial anisotropy, but the dark matter halo is
rather inconspicuous, and it is still unclear how massive it can be. A more
detailed global dynamical study of the whole set of PN velocities will be

leading to delocalization error, and the constancy condition of fractional
spins, leading to static correlation error. These two conditions are now
unified for states with both fractional charge and fractional spin: the exact
energy functional is a plane, linear along the fractional charge coordinate and
constant along the fractional spin coordinate with a line of discontinuity at
the integer. This sheds light on the nature of the derivative discontinuity and
calls for explicitly discontinuous functionals of the density or orbitals that
go beyond currently used smooth approximations. This is key for the application
of DFT to strongly correlated systems.

interest; they are a high temperature superconductor, with a Tc of 55K, but do
not have the two dimensional copper oxygen layer that was thought essential for
superconductivity at these high temperatures. Initial studies have hinted
towards the possibility of a spin density wave (SDW) in these compounds and how
they could play an important role in the superconductivity. SDW's occur at low
temperatures in low-dimensional materials with strong electron correlations or
in metals with a high density of states at the Fermi surface. A transition to
the SDW state has many similarities to the superconducting transition, driven
by the condensation energy with an energy gap opening, and in many materials
the SDW state occurs adjacent in the phase diagram to the superconducting
state. In these materials it is believed that electron doping suppresses the
SDW instability allowing superconductivity to emerge. In this paper we report
on the first direct experimental evidence of a SDW in the LaFeAsO parent
compound as observed with inelastic neutron scattering. We show that these
excitation derive from a two-dimensional Fermi surface nesting with a nesting

model. The PNSs are modeled as the central object in core collapse simulations
using general relativistic three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in
spherical symmetry. The simulations are launched from several massive
progenitors of 40 and 50 solar mass. We analyze the electron-neutrino
luminosity dependencies and construct a simple approximation for the
electron-neutrino luminosity, which depends only on the physical conditions at
the electron-neutrinosphere. In addition, we analyze different mu/tau-neutrino
pair-reactions separately and compare the differences during the post-bounce
phase of failed core collapse supernova explosions of massive progenitors. We
also investigate the connection between the increasing mu/tau-neutrino
luminosity and the PNS contraction during the accretion phase before black hole
formation. Comparing the different post bounce phase of the progenitor models
under investigation, we find large differences in the emitted neutrino spectra.
These differences and the analysis of the electron-neutrino luminosity indicate
a strong progenitor model dependency of the emitted neutrino signal.

by means of photometry is a sophisticated task due to their abnormal colours.
Standard calibrations for normal stars lead to erroneous results and, in most
cases corrections are necessary. In order to specify appropriate corrections,
direct temperature determinations for 176 objects of the different subgroups
were collected from the literature. This much larger sample than in previous
studies therefore allows a more accurate investigation, mostly based on average
temperatures. For the three main photometric systems (UBV, Geneva, Stromgren
uvbybeta), methods to determine effective temperature are presented together
with a comparison with former results. Based on the compiled data we provide
evidence that He (CP4) objects also need a considerable correction, not noticed
in former investigations due to their small number. Additionally, a new
relation for the bolometric correction and the capability of standard
calibrations to deduce interstellar reddening for magnetic CP stars are shown.

atoms of two different hyperfine states in an optical superlattice. The system
is captured by a two-species Bose-Hubbard model, but realizes in a certain
parameter regime actually the physics of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg magnet,
describing the second order hopping processes. Tuning of the superlattice
allows for controlling the effect of fast first order processes versus the
slower second order ones.
  Using the density-matrix renormalization-group method, we provide the
evolution of typical experimentally available observables. The validity of the
description via the Heisenberg model, depending on the parameters of the
Hubbard model, is studied numerically and analytically. The analysis is also
motivated by recent experiments [S. Foelling et al., Nature 448, 1029 (2007);
S. Trotzky et al., Sience 319, 295 (2008)] where coherent two-particle dynamics
with ultracold bosonic atoms in isolated double wells were realized. We provide
theoretical background for the next step, the observation of coherent
many-particle dynamics after coupling the double wells. Contrary to the case of
isolated double wells, relaxation of local observables can be observed. The
tunability between the Bose-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in this
setup could be used to study experimentally the differences in equilibration
processes for nonintegrable and Bethe ansatz integrable models. We show that
the relaxation in the Heisenberg model is connected to a phase averaging
effect, which is in contrast to the typical scattering driven thermalization in
nonintegrable models. We discuss the preparation of magnetic groundstates by
adiabatic tuning of the superlattice parameters.

a Shannon type function $S(x) $ and the following Shannon type formula:
$f(r\theta) =\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{\QTR{Bbb}{S}^{n-1}}S(e^{-j}r\theta

argued in terms of the extended s$_{\pm}$-wave pairing with a sign reversal of
the order parameter among Fermi surfaces. In the normal state, we found the
remarkable decrease of $1/T_1T$ upon cooling for both the Fe and As sites,
which originates from the decrease of low-energy spectral weight of spin
fluctuations over whole ${\bm q}$ space upon cooling below room temperature.
Such behavior has never been observed for other strongly correlated
superconductors where an antiferromagnetic interaction plays a vital role in
mediating the Cooper pairing.

Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) is revisited, with the goal of determining the
minimal assumptions for the validity of a local existence and uniqueness
theorem for the Navier-Stokes fluid fields (solutions of INSE). Emphasis is
placed on fluid fields which, together with suitable derivatives, do not
necessarily decay at infinity and hence do not belong to Sobolev spaces. For
this purpose a novel approach based on a so-called inverse kinetic theory,
recently developed by Tessarotto and Ellero, is adopted. This requires the
construction of a suitable kinetic equation, advancing in time a suitably
smooth kinetic distribution function and providing exactly, as its moment
equations, the complete set of fluid equations. In turn, by proper definition
of the kinetic equation, this permits the introduction of the so-called
\textit{Navier-Stokes dynamical system}, i.e., the dynamical system which
advances in time self-consistently the Navier-Stokes fluid fields.
Investigation of the properties of this dynamical system is crucial for the
establishment of an existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions of
INSE. The new theorem applies both to bounded and unbounded domains and in the
presence of generalized boundaries, represented by surfaces, curves or even
sets of isolated points. In particular, for unbounded domains, solutions are
considered, which do not necessarily vanish at infinity. Basic consequences for
the functional setting of classical solutions are analyzed.

the most massive galaxies, so AGN feedback may have a particularly clear
signature. We find evidence for bipolar outflows in all HzRGs, with kinetic
energies that are equivalent to 0.2% of the rest-mass of the supermassive black
hole. Velocity offsets in the outflows are ~800-1000 km s^-1 between the
blueshifted and redshifted line emission, FWHMs ~1000 km s^-1 suggest strong
turbulence. Ionized gas masses estimated from the Ha luminosity are of order
10^10 M_s, similar to the molecular gas content of HzRGs, underlining that
these outflows may indicate a significant phase in the evolution of the host
galaxy. The total energy release of ~10^60 erg during a dynamical time of ~10^7
yrs corresponds to about the binding energy of a massive galaxy. Geometry,
timescales and energy injection rates of order 10% of the kinetic energy flux
of the jet suggest that the outflows are most likely driven by the radio
source. The global energy density release of ~10^57 erg s^-1 Mpc^-3 may also
influence the subsequent evolution of the HzRG by enhancing the entropy and
pressure in the surrounding halo and facilitating ram-pressure stripping of gas
in satellite galaxies that may contribute to the subsequent mass assembly of

matter and described by a polytropic equation of state. We also consider models
that add entropy to the gas in line with constraints from X-ray observations.
We calculate the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal in these halos and
compare it to the anticipated sensitivities of forthcoming SZ survey
experiments such as ACT, PLANCK and SPT. Using a multi-frequency Wiener filter
we derive SZ detectability limits as a function of halo mass and redshift in
the presence of galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the CMB. We find
that group-sized halos with virial masses below 1e14 M_solar can be detected at
z < 0.05 with the threshold mass dropping to 3-4e13 M_solar at z < 0.01. The SZ
distortion of nearby group-sized halos can thus be mapped out to the virial
radius by these CMB experiments, beyond the sensitivity limits of X-ray
observations. These measurements will provide a unique probe of hot gas in the
outer regions of group halos, shedding insight into the local census of baryons

in the galactic disk and the extraplanar gas. The extraplanar CO emission
follows the morphology of the atomic gas closely but is less extended. The CO
maxima do not appear to correspond to regions where there is peak massive star
formation as probed by Halpha emission. The presence of molecular gas is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for star formation. Compared to the disk
gas, the molecular fraction of the extraplanar gas is 30% lower and the star
formation efficiency of the extraplanar gas is about 3 times lower. The
comparison with an existing dynamical model extended by a recipe for
distinguishing between atomic and molecular gas shows that a significant part
of the gas is stripped in the form of overdense arm-like structures. It is
argued that the molecular fraction depends on the square root of the total
large-scale density. Based on the combination of the CO/Halpha and an
analytical model, the total gas density is estimated to be about 4 times lower
than that of the galactic disk. Molecules and stars form within this dense gas
according to the same laws as in the galactic disk, i.e. they mainly depend on
the total large-scale gas density. Star formation proceeds where the local
large-scale gas density is highest. Given the complex 3D morphology this does
not correspond to the peaks in the surface density. In the absence of a
confining gravitational potential, the stripped gas arms will most probably
disperse; i.e. the density of the gas will decrease and star formation will
cease.

The conclusions drawn from the study are argued to be general for DMS systems

Mn-doped GaAs with various concentrations of As antisite defects. The
magnetization curve, $M(T)$, and the Curie temperature $T_C$ have been
calculated, and are found to be in good correspondence to results from Monte
Carlo simulations and experiments. Furthermore, equilibrium and non-equilibrium
behavior of the magnetic pair correlation function have been extracted. The
dynamics of DMS systems reveals a substantial short ranged magnetic order even
at temperatures at or above the ordering temperature, with a non-vanishing pair
correlation function extending up to several atomic shells. For the high As
antisite concentrations the simulations show a short ranged anti-ferromagnetic
coupling, and a weakened long ranged ferromagnetic coupling. For sufficiently
large concentrations we do not observe any long ranged ferromagnetic
correlation. A typical dynamical response shows that starting from a random
orientation of moments, the spin-correlation develops very fast ($\sim$ 1ps)
extending up to 15 atomic shells. Above $\sim$ 10 ps in the simulations, the
pair correlation is observed to extend over some 40 atomic shells. The
autocorrelation function has been calculated and compared with ferromagnets
like bcc Fe and spin-glass materials. We find no evidence in our simulations
for a spin-glass behaviour, for any concentration of As antisites. Instead the
magnetic response is better described as slow dynamics, at least when compared
to that of a regular ferromagnet like bcc Fe.

systems harboring a pulsar and its impact on the nonthermal radiation of the
binary pulsar PSR B1259-63/SS2883 is discussed. The collision of an
ultrarelativistic pulsar wind with a nonrelativistic stellar outflow results in
significant bulk acceleration of the shocked material from the pulsar wind.
Already at distances comparable to the size of the binary system, the Lorentz
factor of the shocked flow can be as large as $\gamma$~4. This results in
significant anisotropy of the inverse Compton radiation of accelerated
electrons. Because of the Doppler boosting of the produced radiation, one
should expect a variable gamma-ray signal from the system. In particular, this
effect may naturally explain the reported tendency of a decrease of TeV
gamma-ray flux close to the periastron. The modeling of the interaction of
pulsar and stellar winds allows self-consistent calculations of adiabatic
losses. Our results show that adiabatic losses dominate over the radiative
losses. These results have direct impact on the orbital variability of radio,
X-ray and gamma-ray signals detected from the binary pulsar PSR 1259-63/SS2883.

Violations of \mu-e universality in this process may originate from mixing
effects in the right-handed slepton sector, providing a unique window into this
aspect of supersymmetric flavour physics in the large-\tan\beta region. Minimal
unification scenarios with universal soft supersymmetry-breaking terms at the
GUT scale would predict negligible violation of lepton universality. However,
lepton non-universality may be observable in non-minimal grand unified models
with higher-dimensional terms contributing to fermion masses, in which case
renormalization effects above the GUT scale may enhance the mixing among the
right-handed sleptons. This could leads to observable lepton non-universality
in K -> l \nu decays in specific regions of the parameter space with high \tan
\beta, large A terms and small charged Higgs boson mass. Observable
non-universality in K -> l \nu decays would be correlated with a large value of
BR(\tau -> e \gamma). The experimental upper limit on the electric dipole
moment of the electron could be reconciled with leptogenesis, if the latter
occurs at a relatively low scale, which would also alleviate the cosmological

transmitter knows the channel gains of the legitimate receiver and the
eavesdropper. By analyzing the resulting secrecy capacity we quantify the loss
of the secrecy capacity due to the correlation. In addition, we study the
asymptotic behavior of the secrecy capacity as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
tends to infinity. The capacity of an ordinary fading channel logarithmically
increases with SNR. On the contrary, the secrecy capacity converges into a
limit which can be an upper bound on the secrecy capacity over the fading
wiretap channel. We find a closed form of the upper bound for the correlated
Rayleigh wiretap channel which also includes the independent case as a special
one. Our work shows that the upper bound is determined by only two channel
parameters; the correlation coefficient and the ratio of the main to the
eavesdropper channel gains that will be called PCC and CGR respectively. The
analysis of the upper bound tells how the two channel parameters affect the
secrecy capacity and leads to the conclusion that the excessively large signal
power does not provide any advantage in the secrecy capacity, and the loss due

by collecting dust particles in their centers. However, vortex dynamics is
commonly studied in non-self-gravitating disks. The main goal here is to
examine the effects of disk self-gravity on the vortex dynamics via numerical
simulations. In the self-gravitating case, when quasi-steady gravitoturbulent
state is reached, vortices appear as transient structures undergoing recurring
phases of formation, growth to sizes comparable to a local Jeans scale, and
eventual shearing and destruction due to gravitational instability. Each phase
lasts over 2-3 orbital periods. Vortices and density waves appear to be coupled
implying that, in general, one should consider both vortex and density wave
modes for a proper understanding of self-gravitating disk dynamics. Our results
imply that given such an irregular and rapidly changing, transient character of
vortex evolution in self-gravitating disks it may be difficult for such
vortices to effectively trap dust particles in their centers that is a
necessary process towards planet formation.

emits a pair of photons of different frequencies in two distinct cavity modes.
In this way, the condensate mediates entanglement between two cavity modes
which leak out and can be separated and exhibit continuous variable
entanglement. The scheme exploits the experimentally demonstrated strong,
steady and collective coupling of condensate atoms to a cavity field.

computational cost associated with searching large parameter spaces. The study
of efficient template banks, in the sense of using the smallest number of
templates, is therefore of great practical interest. The ""traditional"" approach
to template-bank construction requires every point in parameter space to be
covered by at least one template, which rapidly becomes inefficient at higher
dimensions. Here we study an alternative approach, where any point in parameter
space is covered only with a given probability < 1. We find that by giving up
complete coverage in this way, large reductions in the number of templates are
possible, especially at higher dimensions. The prime examples studied here are
""random template banks"", in which templates are placed randomly with uniform
probability over the parameter space. In addition to its obvious simplicity,
this method turns out to be surprisingly efficient. We analyze the statistical
properties of such random template banks, and compare their efficiency to
traditional lattice coverings. We further study ""relaxed"" lattice coverings
(using Zn and An* lattices), which similarly cover any signal location only
with probability < 1. The relaxed An* lattice is found to yield the most
efficient template banks at low dimensions (n < 10), while random template
banks increasingly outperform any other method at higher dimensions.

field, D-dimensional bare cosmological constant and tensions of branes located
in fixed points. In the spirit of the Universal Extra Dimensions models, the
Standard Model fields are not localized on branes but can move in the bulk. We
define conditions which ensure the stable compactification of the internal
space in zero minimum of the effective potentials. Such effective potentials
may have rather complicated form with a number of local minima, maxima and
saddle points. Then, we investigate inflation in these models. It is shown that
$R^2$ and $R^4$ models can have up to 10 and 22 e-foldings, respectively. These
values are not sufficient to solve the homogeneity and isotropy problem but big
enough to explain the recent CMB data. Additionally, $R^4$ model can provide
conditions for eternal topological inflation. However, the main drawback of the
given inflationary models consists in a value of spectral index $n_s$ which is
less than observable now $n_s\approx 1$. For example, in the case of $R^4$
