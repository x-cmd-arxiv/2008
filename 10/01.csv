to other schemes with comparable proved accuracy thresholds, the Fibonacci

depends on the number of walkers/particles on the link. The mesoscopic
counterpart of such a microscopic dynamics is a diffusing system whose
diffusivity depends on the particle density. A non-equilibrium stationary flux
can be induced by suitable boundary conditions, and we show indeed that it is
mesoscopically described by a Fourier equation with a density dependent
diffusivity. A simple mean-field description predicts a critical diffusivity if
the hopping amplitude vanishes for a certain walker density. Actually, we
evidence that, even if the density equals this pseudo-critical value, the
system does not present any criticality but only a dynamical slowing down. This
property is confirmed by the fact that, in spite of interaction, the particle
distribution at equilibrium is simply described in terms of a product of
Poissonians. For mesoscopic systems with a stationary flux, a very effect of
interaction among particles consists in the amplification of fluctuations,
which is especially relevant close to the pseudo-critical density. This agrees
with analogous results obtained for Ising models, clarifying that larger
fluctuations are induced by the dynamical slowing down and not by a genuine
criticality. The consistency of this amplification effect with altered coloured
noise in time series is also proved.

supersymmetry breaking the messenger fields significantly affect the running of
Standard Model couplings and introduce Landau poles which are difficult to
avoid. This appears to remove any possibility of a meaningful unification
prediction and is often viewed as a strong argument against direct mediation.
We propose two ways that Seiberg duality can circumvent this problem. In the
first, which we call ""deflected-unification"", the SUSY-breaking hidden sector
is a magnetic theory which undergoes a duality to an electric phase, with fewer
elementary degrees of freedom coupled to the MSSM. This changes the
beta-functions of the MSSM gauge couplings so as to push their Landau poles
above the unification scale. We show that this scenario is realised for
recently suggested models of gauge mediation based on a metastable SCQD-type
hidden sector directly coupled to MSSM. The second possibility, which we call
""dual-unification"", begins with the observation that, if the mediating fields
fall into complete SU(5) multiplets, then the MSSM+messengers exhibits a fake
unification at unphysical values of the gauge couplings. We show that, in known
examples of electric/magnetic duals, such a fake unification in the magnetic
theory reflects a real unification in the electric theory. We therefore propose
that the Standard Model could itself be a magnetic dual of some unknown
electric theory in which the true unification takes place. This scenario
maintains the unification prediction (and unification scale) even in the
presence of Landau poles in the magnetic theory below the GUT scale. We further
note that this dual realization of grand unification can explain why Nature
appears to unify, but the proton does not decay.

Hubble-type flow are significant and observable. The deviations are systematic
and a simple parameterization of them considerably improves morpho-kinematical
models of the simulations. We describe such extensions to a homologous
expansion law that capture the global velocity structure of hydrodynamical
axi-symmetric nebulae during their wind-blown phase. It is the size of the
poloidal velocity component that strongly influences the shape of the position
velocity diagrams that are obtained, not so much the variation of the radial
component. The deviations increase with the degree of collimation of the nebula
and they are stronger at intermediate latitudes. We describe potential
deformations which these deviations might produce in 3D reconstructions that
assume ""Hubble-type"" outflows. The general conclusion is that detailed
morpho-kinematic observations and modeling of planetary nebulae can reveal
whether a nebula is still in a hydrodynamically active stage (windy phase) or
whether it has reached ballistic expansion.

interstellar gas. Measurements have been typically expressed in terms of the
positron fraction, which exhibits an increase above 10 GeV. Many scenarios have
been proposed to explain this feature, among them some additional primary
positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in the Galaxy. The PAMELA
satellite has provided high quality data that has enabled high accuracy
statistical analyses to be made, showing that the increase in the positron
fraction extends up to about 100 GeV. It is therefore of paramount importance
to constrain theoretically the expected secondary positron flux to interpret
the observations in an accurate way. We find the secondary positron flux to be
reproduced well by the available observations, and to have theoretical
uncertainties that we quantify to be as large as about one order of magnitude.
We also discuss the positron fraction issue and find that our predictions may
be consistent with the data taken before PAMELA. For PAMELA data, we find that
an excess is probably present after considering uncertainties in the positron
flux, although its amplitude depends strongly on the assumptions made in
relation to the electron flux. By fitting the current electron data, we show
that when considering a soft electron spectrum, the amplitude of the excess
might be far lower than usually claimed. We provide fresh insights that may
help to explain the positron data with or without new physical model
ingredients. PAMELA observations and the forthcoming AMS-02 mission will allow
stronger constraints to be aplaced on the cosmic--ray transport parameters, and
are likely to reduce drastically the theoretical uncertainties.

Correlated molecular motions might play a crucial role for the understanding

dispersion relations for the different molecular components, i.e., the length
scale dependent excitation frequencies and relaxation rates. Only very few
experimental techniques can access dynamical properties in biological materials

find a metal-insulator transition at $U_{c}=5.6\pm0.15t$ which depends weakly
on the cluster size. The onset of the metallic state occurs through the growth
of a coherence peak at the chemical potential. Away from half filling, in the
electron-doped regime, the system is metallic with a large, continuous Fermi
surface as seen experimentally. Upon hole doping, a quasi non-dispersing band
emerges at the top of the lower Hubbard band and controls the low-energy
physics. This band is a clear signature of non-Fermi liquid behavior and cannot
be captured by any weakly coupled approach. This quasi non-dispersive band,
which persists in a certain range of dopings, has been observed experimentally.
We also investigate the pseudogap phenomenon in the context of a triangular
lattice and we propose a new framework for discussing the pseudogap phenomena
in general. This framework involves a momentum-dependent characterization of
the low-energy physics and links the appearance of the pseudogap to a
reconstruction of the Fermi surface without invoking any long range order or
symmetry breaking. Within this framework we predict the existence of a

parameter required to match the final particle size is found to be very close
to that used previously in modeling the formation of uniform gold particles,
suggesting that similar kinetics governs the aggregation process. The model
also reproduces semi quantitatively the effects of temperature and solvent
viscosity on particle synthesis.

In the construction of initial data for binary black holes it is often assumed

the iron morphology is very distinct from the other elements: it is
statistically more asymmetric, more segregated, and has 25% larger emitting
substructures than the lighter ions. Comparatively, the silicon, sulfur, argon,
and calcium are well-mixed, more isotropic, and have smaller, equally-sized
emitting substructures. Based on fits of XMM-Newton spectra in regions
identified as iron rich and iron poor, we determine that the iron in W49B must
have been anisotropically ejected. We measure the abundance ratios in many
regions, and we find that large, local variations are persistent throughout the
remnant. We compare the mean, global abundance ratios to those predicted by
spherical and bipolar core-collapse explosions; the results are consistent with
a bipolar origin from a 25 solar mass progenitor. We calculate the filling
factor of iron from the volume of its emitting substructures, enabling more
precise mass estimates than previous studies. Overall, this work is a first
step toward rigorously describing the physical properties of supernova remnants

early 'Lyman-Werner' background (LWB) at high redshift, prior to the epoch of
reionization. Because of the long mean free path of photons with energies
E<13.6 eV, the LWB was nearly uniform. However, some variation in the LWB is
expected due to the discrete nature of the sources, and their highly clustered
spatial distribution. In this paper, we compute the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the LW flux that irradiates dark matter (DM) halos collapsing
at high-redshift (z~10). Our model accounts for (i) the clustering of DM halos,
(ii) Poisson fluctuations in the number of corresponding star forming galaxies,
and (iii) scatter in the LW luminosity produced by halos of a given mass
(calibrated using local observations). We find that > 99% of the DM halos are
illuminated by a LW flux within a factor of 2 of the global mean value.
However, a small fraction, ~1e-8 to 1e-6, of DM halos with virial temperatures
above 1e4 K have a close luminous neighbor within < 10 kpc, and are exposed to
a LW flux exceeding the global mean by a factor of > 20, or to J_(21,LW)> 1e3
(in units of 1e-21 erg/s/Hz/sr/cm^2). This large LW flux can photo--dissociate
H_2 molecules in the gas collapsing due to atomic cooling in these halos, and
prevent its further cooling and fragmentation. Such close halo pairs therefore
provide possible sites in which primordial gas clouds collapse directly into
massive black holes (M_BH~ 1e4 - 1e6 M_sun), and subsequently grow into
supermassive (M_BH > 1e9 M_sun) black holes by z~6.

non-Arrhenius regime at high $T$ to a regime that is approximately Arrhenius at
low $T$. Motivated by these experiments, Kumar et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100,
105701 (2008)] investigated, by Monte Carlo simulations and mean field
calculations, the relation of the dynamic crossover with the coexistence of two
liquid phases in a cell model for water and predict that: (i) the dynamic
crossover is isochronic, i.e. the value of the crossover time $\tau_{\rm L}$ is
approximately independent of pressure $P$; (ii) the Arrhenius activation energy

timing of the secondary eclipse, and place a 3 sigma upper limit of
|ecos(omega)|<0.0058 where e is the planet's orbital eccentricity and omega is
the argument of pericenter. From this we conclude that tidal heating from

the threshold where atomic cooling by hydrogen allows the gas to cool and
collapse. We neglect cooling by molecular hydrogen and metals, as may be
plausible if H_2 cooling is suppressed by a meta-galactic Lyman-Werner
background or an internal source of Lyman-Werner photons, and metal enrichment
has not progressed very far. The gas in the haloes becomes gravitationally
unstable and develops turbulent velocities comparable to the virial velocities
of the dark matter haloes. Within a few dynamical times it settles into a
nearly isothermal density profile over many decades in radius losing most of
its angular momentum in the process. About 0.1 - 1 % of the baryons, at the
centre of the dark matter haloes, collapse into a self-gravitating, fat,
ellipsoidal, centrifugally supported exponential disc with scale-length of ~
0.075-0.27 pc and rotation velocities of 25-60 kms. We are able to follow the
settling of the gas into centrifugal support and the dynamical evolution of the
compact disc in each dark matter halo for a few dynamical times. The dynamical
evolution of the gas at the centre of the haloes is complex. In one of the
haloes the gas at the centre fragments into a triple system leading to strong
tidal perturbations and eventually to the in-fall of a secondary smaller clump
into the most massive primary clump. The formation of centrifugally supported
self-gravitating massive discs is likely to be an important intermediary stage
en route to the formation of a massive black hole seed.

considering its manipulation under operations not capable of generating
entanglement and show there is a total order for multipartite quantum states in
this framework. We also present new results on hypothesis testing of correlated

analyse the usefulness of quantum computation to calculate additive
approximations to partition functions and spectral densities of local
Hamiltonians. We then show that the determination of ground state energies of

functional loops are formed or eliminated in networks driven to normal spiking
conditions by random, partially correlated inputs, where functional loops
comprise weights that exceed a non-zero threshold. We further prove that STDP
is a form of loop-regulating plasticity for the case of a linear network
comprising random weights drawn from certain distributions. Thus a notable
local synaptic learning rule makes a specific prediction about synapses in the
brain in which standard STDP is present: that under normal spiking conditions,
they should participate in predominantly feed-forward connections at all
scales. Our model implies that any deviations from this prediction would
require a substantial modification to the hypothesized role for standard STDP.
Given its widespread occurrence in the brain, we predict that STDP could also
regulate long range synaptic loops among individual neurons across all brain
scales, up to, and including, the scale of global brain network topology.

account for a 25% variation in the mass of 56Ni synthesized in Type Ia

observed SN Ia luminosities. Higher-metallicity progenitors are more
neutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive
56Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56Ni
yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova
Legacy Survey. We find that the average 56Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from
high metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% of
the dispersion in SN Ia 56Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the
effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find
that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar
metallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the
metallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction
of Timmes, Brown & Truran, so long as one is using the O/H as the independent
variable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that the
luminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56Ni yield, and
thus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is
hard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the
Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al., that the
residuals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy
metallicity, and we find no such correlation.

free energy differences using thermodynamic integration. We employ linear
regression to construct a polynomial that optimally fits the thermodynamic
integration data, and thus reduces the bias and uncertainty of the resulting
free energy estimate. Two test systems with analytical solutions were used to
verify the accuracy and precision of the approach. Our results suggest that
regression with a high degree of polynomials give the most accurate free energy
difference estimates, but often with a slightly larger variance, compared to
commonly used quadrature techniques. High degrees of polynomials possess the
flexibility to closely fit the thermodynamic integration data but are often
sensitive to small changes in data points. To further improve overall accuracy
and reduce uncertainty, we also examine the use of Chebyshev nodes to guide the
selection of non-equidistant lambda values for the thermodynamic integration
scheme. We conclude that polynomial regression with non-equidistant lambda
values delivers the most accurate and precise free energy estimates for
thermodynamic integration data. Software and documentation is available at

picture was constructed based on the correlation landscape in $p_T$,

consistent with competition between fragmentation of survived jets and response
of the medium to quenched jets. At intermediate $p_T$ where the medium response
are important, a large fraction of trigger hadrons do not come from jet
fragmentation. We argue that these hadrons can strongly influence the
interpretation of the low $p_T$ correlation data. We demonstrate this point
through a simple geometrical jet absorption model simulation. The model shows
that the correlation between medium response hadrons dominates the pair yield
and mimics the double hump structure of the away-side $\Delta\phi$ distribution
at low $p_T$. This correlation was also shown to lead to complications in
interpreting the results on reaction plane dependence and three particle
correlations. Finally, we briefly discuss several experimental issues which are
important for proper interpretations of the experimental data.

frontier of a two-dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring
patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple
model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers to explain these
neutral patterns and predict the effect of natural selection. Our model
attributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the
leading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection
introduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that
renders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become
established in a sector. We find that the opening angle of those sectors and
the rate at which they become established depend sensitively on the selective
advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not
able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily ""surf""
on the population front, and thereby reach unusual high frequencies. As a
consequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as
revealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance.
Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in
favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our
prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing
well-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates
for populations that undergo frequent range expansions.

attention from the research community due to its theoretical significance and
applications in wireless ad-hoc networks. An instance of the index coding
problem includes a sender that holds a set of information messages
$X=\{x_1,...,x_k\}$ and a set of receivers $R$. Each receiver $\rho=(x,H)\in R$
needs to obtain a message $x\in X$ and has prior \emph{side information}
comprising a subset $H$ of $X$. The sender uses a noiseless communication
channel to broadcast encoding of messages in $X$ to all clients. The objective
is to find an encoding scheme that minimizes the number of transmissions
required to satisfy the receivers' demands with \emph{zero error}.
  In this paper, we analyze the relation between the index coding problem, the
more general network coding problem and the problem of finding a linear
representation of a matroid. In particular, we show that any instance of the
network coding and matroid representation problems can be efficiently reduced
to an instance of the index coding problem. Our reduction implies that many
important properties of the network coding and matroid representation problems
carry over to the index coding problem. Specifically, we show that \emph{vector
linear codes} outperform scalar linear codes and that vector linear codes are
insufficient for achieving the optimum number of transmissions.

conjecture, whose validity is still one of the most important open questions in
general relativity, asserts that the undesirable spacetime singularities are
always hidden inside of black holes. In this Letter we reanalyze extreme
situations which have been considered as counterexamples to the cosmic
censorship hypothesis. In particular, we consider the absorption of fermion
particles by a spinning black hole. Ignoring quantum effects may lead one to
conclude that an incident fermion wave may over spin the black hole, thereby
exposing its inner singularity to distant observers. However, we show that when
quantum effects are properly taken into account, the integrity of the
black-hole event horizon is irrefutable. This observation suggests that the
cosmic censorship principle is intrinsically a quantum phenomena.

is provided for a phenomenon known as metastability, which in the present
context means that solutions spend a very long time near the family of
solutions known as diffusive N-waves before finally converging to a stable
self-similar diffusion wave. More precisely, it is shown that in terms of
similarity, or scaling, variables in an algebraically weighted $L^2$ space, the
self-similar diffusion waves correspond to a one-dimensional global center
manifold of stationary solutions. Through each of these fixed points there
exists a one-dimensional, global, attractive, invariant manifold corresponding
to the diffusive N-waves. Thus, metastability corresponds to a fast transient
in which solutions approach this ""metastable"" manifold of diffusive N-waves,
followed by a slow decay along this manifold, and, finally, convergence to the
self-similar diffusion wave.

phase to amorphous phase exhibited a systematic decrease of TC(paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic transition temperature) and spontaneous magnetization (MS). The
experimental results suggested few more features, e.g., appearance of large
magnetic irreversibility in the temperature dependence of magnetization, lack
of magnetic saturation at high magnetic field, blocking of magnetization below
TB, and enhancement of coercivity. In addition, the magnetic phase transition
near to TC has changed from first order character in bulk sample to second
order character in nanocrystalline and amorphous samples. We understand the
observed magnetic features as the effects of decreasing particle size and
increasing magnetic (spin- lattice) disorder. We noted that magnetic dynamics
of amorphous samples is distinctly different from the nanocrystalline samples.
The ferromagnetism of amorphous samples are comparable with the properties of
reported amorphous ferromagnetic nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the effect
of disorder shell in controlling the dynamics of ferromagnetic cores.

reaction of the accelerated particles, the generation of magnetic fields in the

When the fraction of particles which get accelerated is of order $\sim

of streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is compatible with the
interpretation of the X-ray emitting filaments being produced by strong
synchrotron losses in $\sim 100 \mu G$ magnetic fields. If the X-ray filaments
are explained in alternative ways, the constraint on the magnetic field
downstream of the shock disappears and the HESS data can be marginally fit with
ICS of relativistic electrons off a complex population of photons, tailored to
comprise CMB and ambient IR/Optical photons. The fit, typically poor at the
highest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the
remnant; only a fraction of order $\sim 10^{-6}$ of the background particles
gets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of order $\sim 20\mu G$ and the
maximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS

mind and the foundation to the scientific understanding of nature. Some
mathematicians have suspected a link between prime numbers and secrets of
creation. Understanding creativity may help resolve the deepest mysteries of
primes. The algorithm that programs the mind and makes the mind creative must
be sufficient for the mind to create primes. I found that primes are directly
linked to the creation algorithm of the mind. The essence of primes is the
duality of uniqueness and uniformity together with the creation algorithm of
the mind. The creative process of the mind is lawfully determined but the
outcome is unpredictable. The mathematical equivalent or model of this process
is the creation of primes. Primes have the inherent property of
unpredictability but can be generated by the creation algorithm of the mind,
termed the Prime Law, via a fully deterministic lawful process. This new
understanding of the essence of primes can deduce some of the best-known
properties of primes, including the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Understanding
human creativity is obviously the most fundamental of all scientific enquiries.
That this understanding can directly lead to a solution to the RH, widely
considered the most important unsolved problem in mathematics, shows a deep
connection between creativity and mathematics.

principal non-commutative torus bundles up to equivariant Morita equivalence.
We then study these bundles as topological fibrations (forgetting the group
action) and give necessary and sufficient conditions for any non-commutative
principal torus bundle being RKK-equivalent to a commutative one. As an
application of our methods we shall also give a K-theoretic characterization of
those principal torus-bundles with H-flux, as studied by Mathai and Rosenberg

physics run with an increased target mass. Scintillating $\mathrm{CaWO_4}$
single crystals, operated at temperatures of a few millikelvin, are used as
target to detect the tiny nuclear recoil induced by a WIMP. The powerful
background identification and rejection of $\alpha$, e$^{-}$ and $\gamma$

scintillation signal generated in the $\mathrm{CaWO_4}$ crystal. However,
neutrons could still be misidentified as a WIMP signature. Therefore, a
detailed understanding of the individual recoil behaviour in terms of phonon
generation and scintillation light emission due to scattering on Ca, O or W
nuclei, respectively, is mandatory. The only setup which allows to perform such
measurements at the operating temperature of the CRESST detectors has been

a longest queue within a randomly chosen subset of connected queues. A
Markovian model is studied where mean packet transmission time is $n^{-1}$ and
packet arrival rate is $\lambda<1$ per queue. Transient and equilibrium
distributions of queue occupancies are obtained in the limit as the system size
$n$ tends to infinity.

investigate the $\lambda_R$-parameter, which is a luminosity weighted measure
of projected angular momentum per unit mass. This parameter was introduced to
subdivide the SAURON sample of early type galaxies in so called fast $\lambda_R
> 0.1$ and slow rotators $\lambda_R < 0.1$. Tests on merger remnants reveal
that $\lambda_R$ is a robust indicator of the true angular momentum content in
elliptical galaxies. We find the same range of $\lambda_R$ values in our merger
remnants as in the SAURON galaxies. The merger mass ratio is decisive in
creating a slow or a fast rotator in a single binary merger, the former being
created mostly in an equal mass merger. Slow rotators have a $\lambda_R$ which
does not vary with projection. The confusion rate with face-on fast rotators is
very small. Merger with low gas fractions form slow rotators with smaller
ellipticities and are in much better agreement with the SAURON slow rotators.
Remergers of merger remnants are slow rotators but tend to have too high
ellipticities. Fast rotators maintain the angular momentum content from the
progenitor disc galaxy if merger mass ratio is high. Some SAURON galaxies have
values of $\lambda_R$ as high as our progenitor disc galaxies.

Instead, for a wide range of radio powers all the sources with broad emission
lines show similar SEDs, with synchrotron components peaking below the
optical/UV range. Of the remaining 4 ""anomalous"" blazars, two highly luminous
sources with broad lines, claimed to possibly emit synchrotron X-rays, are
shown to be better described with IC models for their X-ray emission. For one

or high constant velocity, one of them, with the N- and C-terminal beta-strands

late types. The coronae of early M dwarfs display high X-ray luminosities and
temperatures, a pronounced inverse FIP effect, and frequent flaring to the
extent that no quiescent level can be defined in many cases. For late M dwarfs,
fewer but more violent flares have been observed, and the quiescent X-ray
luminosity is much lower. To probe the relationship between coronal properties
with spectral type of active M dwarfs, we analyze the M3.5 and M4.5 components
of the EQ Peg binary system in comparison with other active M dwarfs of
spectral types M0.5 to M5.5. We investigate the timing behavior of both
components of the EQ Peg system, reconstruct their differential emission
measure, and investigate the coronal abundance ratios based on emission-measure
independent line ratios from their Chandra HETGS spectra. Finally we test for
density variations in different states of activity. The X-ray luminosity of EQ
Peg A (M3.5) is by a factor of 6-10 brighter than that of EQ Peg B (M4.5). Like
most other active M dwarfs, the EQ Peg system shows an inverse FIP effect. The
abundances of both components are consistent within the errors; however, there
seems to be a tendency toward the inverse FIP effect being less pronounced in
the less active EQ Peg B when comparing the quiescent state of the two stars.
This trend is supported by our comparison with other M dwarfs. As the X-ray
luminosity decreases with later spectral type, so do coronal temperatures and
flare rate. The amplitude of the observed abundance anomalies, i.e. the inverse
FIP effect, declines; however, clear deviations from solar abundances remain.

receding velocity of galaxies which can be greater than the speed of light, and
the presence of the linear Hubble law deeply inside inhomogeneous galaxy

gravitons, and no energy-momentum conservation for matter plus gravity because

conclude that (1) the ejection of Fe-peak products and the fallback of

that the electromagnetic energy stored in many relatively slow moving electrons

distance-redshift relation as ""De Sitter effect"". For homogeneous matter
distribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of
distance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the
fractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function
of distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the
Hubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal
cosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles.
The first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the
gravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual
unity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the
relativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is
that the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales
up to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is
assumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is
the explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all
three phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale
structure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large
scale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter

There are three kinds of carriers, each with a different behavior:

anisotropies. The relationship is obtained between the concentration nq of

follows. We give the hole density in ab plane a definite physical meaning, and
also define explicitly optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping. Our model
gives the correct temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hole
constant on optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping, and it predicts the

reduced conversion is found at the sample surface, even in case of a near
perfect (Rb:Mn:Fe=1:1:1) stoichiometry. Thus, the intrinsic incompleteness of
the charge transfer transition in these materials is found to be primarily due
to surface reconstruction. Substitution of a large fraction of charge transfer
active Mn ions by charge transfer inactive Cu ions leads to a proportional
conversion reduction with respect to the maximum conversion that is still
stoichiometrically possible and shows the charge transfer capability of metal
centers to be quite robust upon inclusion of a neighboring impurity.

on the s-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars at halo metallicity. Recent
stellar models including rotation at very low metallicity predict a strong
production of primary N14. Part of the nitrogen produced in the H-burning shell
diffuses by rotational mixing into the He core where it is converted to Ne22
providing additional neutrons for the s process. We present nucleosynthesis
calculations for a 25 Msun star at [Fe/H] = -3, -4, where in the convective
core He-burning about 0.8 % in mass is made of primary Ne22. The usual weak
s-process shape is changed by the additional neutron source with a peak between
Sr and Ba, where the s-process yields increase by orders of magnitude with
respect to the yields obtained without rotation. Iron seeds are fully consumed
and the maximum production of Sr, Y and Zr is reached. On the other hand, the
s-process efficiency beyond Sr and the ratio Sr/Ba are strongly affected by the
amount of Ne22 and by nuclear uncertainties, first of all by the
Ne22(alpha,n)Mg25 reaction. Finally, assuming that Ne22 is primary in the
considered metallicity range, the s-process efficiency decreases with
metallicity due to the effect of the major neutron poisons Mg25 and Ne22. This
work represents a first step towards the study of primary neutron source effect
in fast rotating massive stars, and its implications are discussed in the light
of spectroscopic observations of heavy elements at halo metallicity.

linear, and one can integrate part of the constraints by introducing gauge
potentials. This way the equivalence of the geometrical formulation with the
standard formulation in terms of gauge potentials is made manifest. On (A)dS

use it to extend much of the previous analysis to this case. In particular, we

role of the stellar chromosphere in determining the position and the thickness
of the shocked region. We perform 1-D HD simulations of the impact of the
accretion flow onto chromosphere of a CTTS, including the effects of gravity,
radiative losses from optically thin plasma, thermal conduction and a well
tested detailed model of the stellar chromosphere. Here we present the results
of a simulation based on the parameters of the CTTS MP Mus. We find that the
accretion shock generates an hot slab of material above the chromosphere with a
maximum thickness of 1.8X10^9 cm, density n_e~10^11-10^2 cm^-3, temperature
T~3X10^6 K and uniform pressure equal to the ram pressure of the accretion flow

evolves with quasi-periodic instabilities of the material in the slab leading
to cyclic disappearance and re-formation of the slab. For an accretion rate of

is established. The relations are the so called P_n relations which appear in
the study of certain 3-manifold invariants. Next a class of cohomology groups
are introduced, called Pluri-Hodge groups (somewhat in keeping with the notion
of pluri-canonical groups). These are Dolbeault groups on a complex manifold X
with values in tensor powers of sheaves of holomorphic forms of various
degrees. By Riemann-Roch one shows that knowledge of the Pluri-Hodge groups
gives precise formulae for all Chern numbers of the manifold. When X is
holomorphic symplectic the Pluri-Hodge groups form representations of Sp(g)
where g counts the number of tensor products. Still with X holomorphic
symplectic, the Pluri-Hodge groups are vectors in the vector space H_g(X) of
states in the topological field theory of Rozansky and Witten for a 3-manifold

1$). The sigma-model approach and exact solutions with intersecting composite
branes (e.g. solutions with harmonic functions, $S$-brane and black brane ones)
with intersection rules related to non-singular Kac-Moody (KM) algebras (e.g.
hyperbolic ones) are reviewed. Some examples of solutions, e.g. corresponding
to hyperbolic KM algebras: $H_2(q,q)$, $AE_3$, $HA_2^{(1)}$, $E_{10}$ and
Lorentzian KM algebra $P_{10}$ are presented.

is of the order of 1 GeV) chiral perturbation theory provides a
model-independent approach for quantitative description of nuclear processes.
In the two- and more-nucleon sector perturbation theory is applicable only at
the level of an effective potential which serves as input in the corresponding
dynamical equation. To deal with the resulting many-body problem we put chiral
effective field theory (EFT) on the lattice. Here we present the results of our
lattice EFT study up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion.
Accurate description of two-nucleon phase-shifts and ground state energy ratio
of dilute neutron matter up to corrections of higher orders shows that lattice
EFT is a promising tool for a quantitative description of low-energy few- and
many-body systems.

Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equation (FPKfe) and the Feynman path integral
descriptions of stochastic processes relevant for the solution of the
continuous-discrete filtering problem is provided in this paper. The practical
utility of the path integral formula is demonstrated via some nontrivial
examples. Specifically, it is shown that the simplest approximation of the path
integral formula for the fundamental solution of the FPKfe can be applied to
solve nonlinear continuous-discrete filtering problems quite accurately. The
Dirac-Feynman path integral filtering algorithm is quite simple, and is
suitable for real-time implementation.

test particle by the the weak-field approximation of the Kerr-de Sitter metric.
It results that the node, the pericentre and the mean anomaly undergo secular
precessions proportional to k, which is a measure of the non linearity of the
theory. We used such theoretical predictions and the latest observational
determinations of the non-standard precessions of the perihelia of the inner
planets of the Solar System to put a bound on k getting k <= 10^-29 m^-2. The
node rate of the LAGEOS Earth's satellite yields k <= 10^-26 m^-2. The
periastron precession of the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B allows to obtain k
<= 3 10^-21 m^-2. Interpreting k as a cosmological constant \Lambda, it turns
out that such constraints are weaker than those obtained from the
Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric.
