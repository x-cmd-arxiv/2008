in jet pair production in proton-proton collisions at the Brookhaven
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), with the goal to constrain
longitudinally polarized quark and antiquark distribution functions. A
measurable asymmetry could be observed in the vicinity of the massive weak W
boson resonance, where the parity-violating signal appears above the
parity-conserving background and is enhanced by interference of the strong and
electroweak production amplitudes. We discuss the potential for such
measurements, perhaps the first opportunity to measure a parity-violating

to the polarization of down-type antiquarks is demonstrated.

find that the physical model describes a substantial part of the PSF size and
anisotropy over the field of view (over 90 percent of it, based on a
chi-squared metric). We identify the primary contributors to the PSF patterns
and study their covariances and principal components. We also identify
correlations with the effect of gravity on the telescope. Finally, we discuss
the improvements in PSF estimation that may be achieved by combining the

natural way to define a ""system"" in general relativity. An RQF is defined as a
two-parameter family of timelike worldlines comprising the worldtube boundary
of the history of a finite spatial volume, with the rigidity conditions that
the congruence of worldlines is expansion-free (constant size) and shear-free
(constant shape). This definition of a system is anticipated to yield simple,
exact geometrical insights into the problem of motion in general relativity. It
begins by answering the questions what is in motion (a rigid two-dimensional
system boundary), and what motions of this rigid boundary are possible. Nearly
a century ago Herglotz and Noether showed that a three-parameter family of
timelike worldlines in Minkowski space satisfying Born's 1909 rigidity
conditions has only three degrees of freedom instead of the six we are familiar
with from Newtonian mechanics. We argue that in fact we can implement Born's
notion of rigid motion in both flat spacetime (this paper) and arbitrary curved
spacetimes containing sources (subsequent papers) - with precisely the expected
three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom - provided the
system is defined quasilocally as the two-dimensional set of points comprising
the boundary of a finite spatial volume, rather than the three-dimensional set
of points within the volume.

with frequencies $\omega=(0.5-0.7) m\Omega_{\rm ISCO}$, can be overstable due
to general relativistic effects, according to which the radial epicyclic
frequency is a non-monotonic function of radius near the black hole. The mode
is trapped inside the corotation resonance radius and carries a negative
energy. The mode growth arises primarily from wave absorption at the corotation
resonance, and the sign of the wave absorption depends on the gradient of the
disc vortensity. When the mode frequency is sufficiently high, such that the
slope of the vortensity is positive at corotation positive wave energy is
absorbed at the resonance, leading to the growth of mode amplitude. We also
study how the rapid radial inflow at the inner edge of the disc affects the
mode trapping and growth. Our analysis of the behavior of the fluid
perturbations in the transonic flow near the ISCO indicates that, while the
inflow tends to damp the mode, the damping effect is sufficiently small under
some conditions so that net mode growth can still be achieved. We further
clarify the role of the Rossby wave instability and show that it does not
operate for black hole accretion discs with smooth-varying vortensity profiles.
Overstable non-axisymmetric p-modes driven by the corotational instability
provide a plausible explanation for the high-frequency (> 100 Hz)
quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed from a number of black-hole X-ray
binaries in the very high state. The absence of HFQPOs in the soft (thermal)
state may result from mode damping due to the radial infall at the ISCO.

Contrary to extragalactic nuclear star clusters, using current technology it

The number density of stars in the Galactic center nuclear star cluster can be

accuracy. Aims: Homogeneous iron abundance measurements for 33 Galactic
Cepheids located in the outer disk together with accurate distance
determinations based on near-infrared photometry are adopted to constrain the
Galactic iron gradient beyond 10 kpc. Methods: Iron abundances were determined
using high resolution Cepheid spectra collected with three different
observational instruments: ESPaDOnS@CFHT, Narval@TBL and FEROS@2.2m ESO/MPG
telescope. Cepheid distances were estimated using near-infrared (J,H,K-band)
period-luminosity relations and data from SAAO and the 2MASS catalog. Results:
The least squares solution over the entire data set indicates that the iron
gradient in the Galactic disk presents a slope of -0.052+/-0.003 dex/kpc in the
5-17 kpc range. However, the change of the iron abundance across the disk seems
to be better described by a linear regime inside the solar circle and a
flattening of the gradient toward the outer disk (beyond 10 kpc). In the latter
region the iron gradient presents a shallower slope, i.e. -0.012+/-0.014
dex/kpc. In the outer disk (10-12 kpc) we also found that Cepheids present an
increase in the spread in iron abundance. Current evidence indicates that the
spread in metallicity depends on the Galactocentric longitude. Finally, current
data do not support the hypothesis of a discontinuity in the iron gradient at
Galactocentric distances of 10-12 kpc. Conclusions: The occurrence of a spread
in iron abundance as a function of the Galactocentric longitude indicates that
linear radial gradients should be cautiously treated to constrain the chemical
evolution across the disk.

The synchrotron and Synchrotron-Self Compton jet emissivity are computed at

flaring states.Time-dependent jet emission can be computed by varying the

small variations of the injected density are required during the flares. The
stratification of the jet emission, together with a pile-up distribution,
allows significantly lower bulk Lorentz factors, compared to one-zone models.

here it is shown that tunneling is too slow. We calculate the bubble nucleation
rates for phase transitions in the thick wall limit, approximating the barrier

the string landscape that uses series of minima along the monodromy staircase
around the conifold point. The basic problem is that the minima of the
potential are too far apart to allow rapid enough tunneling in these two
models. We entertain the possibility of overcoming this problem by modifying
the gravity sector to a Brans-Dicke theory. However, one would need extremely
small values for the Brans-Dicke parameter. Many successful alternatives exist,
including other ""axions"" (with mass scales not set by QCD) or potentials with
comparable heights and widths that do not suffer from the problem of slow
tunneling and provide successful candidates for chain inflation.

the system harbours a near-extreme Kerr black-hole with the spin near 0.998 and
mass M<7.3M_sun. Recently it was discovered that the orbital 3-velocity of
Keplerian (geodesical) discs orbiting Kerr black holes with the spin a>0.9953,
being analyzed in the locally non-rotating frames, reveals a hump near the
marginally stable orbit. Further it was suggested that the hump could excite
the epicyclic motion of particles near the ISCO with frequencies typical for
high-frequency QPOs. Characteristic frequency of the hump-induced oscillations
was defined as the maximal positive rate of change of the LNRF-related orbital
velocity with the proper radial distance. If the characteristic ""humpy
frequency"" and the radial epicyclic frequency are commensurable, strong
resonant phenomena are expected. For the Kerr black hole with the spin a=0.9982
the ""humpy frequency"" and the radial epicyclic frequency are in ratio 1:3.

shifting the whole rho(T) curves downward, whereas its effect on
superconducting (Ba0.55K0.45)Fe2As2 is to shift the onset of superconductivity

on CaFe2As2 is first to suppress the crystallographic transformation and induce
superconductivity with onset near 12 K very rapidly, i.e., for P < 5 kbar.
However, higher pressures bring about another phase transformation
characterized by reduced resistivity, and the suppression of superconductivity,
confining superconductivity to a narrow pressure dome centered near 5 kbar.

which occurred in Greece shows some very interesting results. Long before the
EQ occurrence the phase map generated by the uncorrelated each other signals
recorded by a pair of distant monitoring sites is characterized by pairs of
hyperbolas of random azimuth asymptotes. Some days before the occurrence of the
earthquake the recorded signals are strongly correlated and therefore the phase
map is characterized by ellipses. A couple of days before the EQ occurrence the
electric signals become again uncorrelated due to the fact that their
generating mechanism (large scale piezoelectricity) approaches its final stage
and therefore hyperbolas characterize again the phase map. When this stage is
observed the pending EQ shortly (in terms of days) takes place. Three detailed

astrophysics to study the interaction of a realistic distribution of dust
grains with gas in a vertically stratified protostellar accretion disc. The
disc was modeled to have the density and temperature of a minimum mass solar
nebula, and was driven to a fully-developed turbulence via the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). We find that the inclusion of standard
dust to gas ratios does not have any significant effect on the MRI even when
the dust sediments to the midplane of the accretion disc. The density
distribution of the dust reaches a Gaussian profile, and the scale heights for
the dust that we derive are shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the
square root of the dust radius. The largest dust shows a strong tendency to
settle to the midplane of the accretion disc, and tends to organize itself into
elongated clumps of high density. The dynamics of these clumps is shown to be
consistent with a streaming instability. The streaming instability is seen to
be very vigorous and persistent once it forms. Each stream of high density dust
displays a reduced RMS velocity dispersion, and the densest clumpings of large
dust are shown to form where the streams intersect. We have also shown that the
mean free path and collision time for the dust that participates in the
streaming instability is reduced by almost two orders of magnitude relative to
the average mean free paths and collision times. We show that some of the large

Since there are two levels of randomness for random walks in random
environments, there are two different distributions for the random walk that
can be studied. The quenched distribution is the law of the random walk
conditioned on a given environment. The annealed distribution is the quenched
law averaged over all environments. The main results of the thesis fall into
two categories: quenched limiting distributions for one-dimensional, transient
RWRE and annealed large deviations for multidimensional RWRE.
  The analysis of the quenched distributions for transient, one-dimensional
RWRE falls into two separate cases. First, when an annealed central limit
theorem holds, we prove that a quenched central limit theorem also holds but
with a random (depending on the environment) centering. In contrast, when the
annealed limit distribution is not Gaussian, we prove that there is no quenched
limiting distribution for the RWRE. Moreover, we show that for almost every
environment, there exist two random (depending on the environment) sequences of
times, along which random walk has different quenched limiting distributions.
  While an annealed large deviation principle for multidimensional RWRE was
known previously, very little qualitative information was available about the
annealed large deviation rate function. We prove that if the law on
environments is non-nestling, then the annealed large deviation rate function
is analytic in a neighborhood of its unique zero (which is the limiting
velocity of the RWRE).

by the recent discovery of extended UV (XUV) disks around many nearby spiral
galaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent star
formation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field. These
regions were selected on the basis of their UV luminosity from GALEX and
include two HII regions, two regions which are UV-bright but Halpha-faint, and
one ""control"" region faint in both UV and Halpha. We estimate our effective SFR
detection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 Msun/yr, which is lower than that of GALEX for
regions of this size. As expected, the HII regions contain massive main
sequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 Msun, based on our best extinction
estimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in the
UV-bright/Halpha-faint regions. The observations are consistent with stellar
ages <10 Myr in the HII regions, and >16 Myr in the UV-bright/Halpha-faint
regions. All regions but the control have formed ~10^4 Msun of stars over the
past ~65 Myr. Thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer disk
of M81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain the
observed discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in Halpha and those
detected exclusively in UV. However, our data cannot conclusively rule out
other explanations, such as a strongly truncated initial mass function (IMF).

of the prompt emission. Some evidence of it comes from the presence of strong
precursors, post-cursors, and X-ray flares in a sizable fraction of bursts.
Additional evidence comes from the fact that often the X-ray and the optical
afterglow light curves do not track one another, suggesting that they are two
different emission components. The typical ""steep-flat-steep"" behavior of the
X-ray light curve can be explained if the same central engine responsible for
the main prompt emission continues to be active for a long time, but with a
decreasing power. The early X-ray ""afterglow"" emission is then the extension of
the prompt emission, originating at approximately the same location, and is not
due to forward shocks. If the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma is decreasing in time,
the break ending the shallow phase can be explained, since at early times Gamma
is large, and we see only a fraction of the emitting area. Later, when Gamma
decreases, we see an increasing fraction of the emitting surface up to the time
when Gamma ~ 1/theta_j. This time ends the shallow phase of the X-ray light
curve. The origin of the late prompt emission can be the accretion of the
fall-back material, with an accretion rate dot M proportional to t^(-5/3). The
combination of this late prompt emission with the flux produced by the standard
forward shock can explain the great diversity of the optical and the X-ray
light curves.

solutions are characterized by a constant field velocity, and we dub such
models {\it isokinetic} inflation. As in the canonical limit, isokinetic
inflation has a slightly red-tilted power spectrum, consistent with current
data. Unlike the canonical case, however, these models can have an arbitrarily
small tensor/scalar ratio. Of particular interest is that isokinetic inflation
is marked by a correlation between the tensor/scalar ratio and the amplitude of
non-Gaussianity such that parameter regimes with small tensor/scalar ratio have
{\it large} associated non-Gaussianity, which is a distinct observational

focusing on the large-scale shock discovered as a surface brightness

determined from the temperature jumps are in good agreement with the Mach
numbers derived from EPIC/pn surface brightness profiles and previously from
Chandra data and are consistent with M~1.3. The estimated shock age in the
different sectors using a spherically symmetric point explosion model ranges
between 130 and 230 Myr and the outburst energy between 1.5 and 3e61 ergs. The
shape of the shock seen in the pressure map can be approximated with an ellipse
centered 70 kpc towards the NE from the cluster center. We aimed to develop a
better model that can explain the offset between the shock center and the AGN
and give a consistent result on the shock age and energy. To this end, we
performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations in which the shock is produced by a
symmetrical pair of AGN jets launched in a spherical galaxy cluster. As an
explanation of the observed offset of the shock center, we consider large-scale
bulk flows in the intracluster medium. The simulation successfully reproduces
the size, ellipticity, and average Mach number of the observed shock front. The
predicted age of the shock is 160 Myr and the total input energy 3e61 erg. Both
values are within the range determined by the spherically symmetric model.
Matching the observed 70 kpc offset of the shock ellipse from the cluster
center requires large-scale coherent motions with a high velocity of 670 km/s.
We discuss the feasibility of this scenario and offer alternative ways to
produce the offset and to further improve the simulation.

progenitors of the present-day numerous population of spirals. There is growing
evidence that they have evolved rapidly since the last 6 to 8 Gyr ago, and
likely have formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass, often showing
perturbed morphologies and kinematics. We have gathered a representative sample
of 88 such galaxies and have provided robust estimates of their gas phase
metallicity. For doing so, we have used moderate spectral resolution
spectroscopy at VLT/FORS2 with unprecedented high S/N allowing to remove biases
coming from interstellar absorption lines and extinction to establish robust
values of R23=([OII]3727 + [OIII]4959,5007)/Hbeta. We definitively confirm that
the predominant population of z~0.6 starbursts and luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs)
are on average, two times less metal rich than the local galaxies at a given
stellar mass. We do find that the metal abundance of the gaseous phase of
galaxies is evolving linearly with time, from z=1 to z=0 and after comparing
with other studies, from z=3 to z=0. Combining our results with the reported
evolution of the Tully Fisher relation, we do find that such an evolution
requires that ~30% of the stellar mass of local galaxies have been formed
through an external supply of gas, thus excluding the close box model. Distant
starbursts & LIRGs have properties (metal abundance, star formation efficiency
& morphologies) similar to those of local LIRGs. Their underlying physics is
likely dominated by gas infall probably through merging or interactions. Our
study further supports the rapid evolution of z~0.4-1 galaxies. Gas exchanges
between galaxies is likely the main cause of this evolution.

Warren (2004), we explore how correct this assumption is and, moving a step
further, we try to qualify the nature of stochasticity. We use Principal
Component Analysis applied to the outputs of a cosmological N-body simulation
to: (1) explore the behaviour of stochasticity in the correlation between
haloes of different masses; (2) explore the behaviour of stochasticity in the
correlation between haloes and dark matter. We show results obtained using a
catalogue with 2.1 million haloes, from a PMFAST simulation with box size of
1000h^{-1}Mpc. In the relation between different populations of haloes we find
that stochasticity is not-negligible even at large scales. In agreement with
the conclusions of Tegmark & Bromley (1999) who studied the correlations of
different galaxy populations, we found that the shot-noise subtracted
stochasticity is qualitatively different from `enhanced' shot noise and,
specifically, it is dominated by a single stochastic eigenvalue. We call this
the `minimally stochastic' scenario, as opposed to shot noise which is
`maximally stochastic'. In the correlation between haloes and dark matter, we
find that stochasticity is minimized, as expected, near the dark matter peak (k
~ 0.02 h Mpc^{-1} for a LambdaCDM cosmology) and, even at large scales, it is
of the order of 15 per cent above the shot noise. Moreover, we find that the
reconstruction of the dark matter distribution is improved when we use
eigenvectors as tracers of the bias. [Abridged]

radii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian
distribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes
increasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of
the Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a
power-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark
matter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in
the center of the main halo. The power-law Q(r) profile likely reflects the
distribution of entropy (K = sigma^2/rho^{2/3} \propto r^{1.2}), which dark
matter acquires as it is accreted onto a growing halo. The estimated f(x, v),
on the other hand, exhibits a more complicated behavior. Although the median
coarse-grained phase-space density profile F(r) can be approximated by a
power-law in the inner regions of halos and at larger radii the profile

from high-excitation C I and O I absorption lines in metal-poor halo stars,
with the aim of clarifying the main sources of these two elements in the early
stages of the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. We target 15 new stars
compared to our previous study, with an emphasis on additional C/O
determinations in the crucial metallicity range -3<[Fe/H]<-2. Departures from
local thermodynamic equilibrium were accounted for in the line formation for
both carbon and oxygen. The non-LTE effects are very strong at the lowest
metallicities but, contrary to what has sometimes been assumed in the past due
to a simplified assessment, of different degrees for the two elements. In
addition, for the 28 stars with [Fe/H]<-1 previously analysed, stellar
parameters were re-derived and non-LTE corrections applied in the same fashion
as for the rest of our sample, giving consistent abundances for 43 halo stars
in total. The new observations and non-LTE calculations strengthen previous
suggestions of an upturn in C/O towards lower metallicity (particularly for
[O/H]<-2). Adopting the H collisional cross-sections estimated from the
classical Drawin formula leads to [C/O]~0 at [O/H]~-3. To remove the upturn in
C/O, near-LTE formation for O I lines would be required, which could only
happen if the H collisional efficiency with the Drawin recipe is underestimated
by factors of up to several tens of times, which we consider unlikely. The high
C/O values derived at the lowest metallicities may be revealing the
fingerprints of Population III stars or may signal rotationally-aided
nucleosynthesis in more normal Population II stars.

steeper inner truncation than outward falloff in radial surface brightness. The
inferred spatial distribution of the disk grains is consistent with the

settling reduces opacity due to grains from full interstellar values (Podolak

produce nearly identical formation timescales and core/atmosphere mass ratios.
We therefore observe a new manifestation of core accretion theory: at large

orbital velocity) controls the planet formation timescale. We argue that this

Auger electron spectroscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR). The

on cultural memes that colonize humans hosts. In analogy to studying the

religious memes colonize individual humans. Rates of transmission of memes
between humans, i.e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of
memes (loss of faith) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural memes,
and by interactions between hosts carrying different memes. In particular,
based on the notion that religion can lead to oppression of lower classes once
a religious society has reached a certain size, we assume that the rate of loss
increases as the number of humans colonized by a particular meme phenotype
increases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural memes, and
we use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can generate
the emergence of coexisting clusters of different meme types. The different
clusters correspond to different religions, and hence our model describes the
emergence of distinct descendent religions from single ancestral religions.

TeV is well described by a power law with an index of Gamma = 3.08 +/-
0.34(stat) +/- 0.2(sys). The integral flux above 200 GeV corresponds to ~6% of
that of the Crab Nebula. The light curve does not show any evidence for VHE
flux variability. Using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic
background light (EBL) in the near-IR to mid-IR we are able to limit the range
of intrinsic energy spectra for 1ES 1218+304. We show that the intrinsic photon
spectrum is harder than a power law with an index of Gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37.
When including constraints from the spectra of 1ES 1101-232 and 1ES 0229+200,
the spectrum of 1ES 1218+304 is likely to be harder than Gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37.

clathrates with multiple guest species, so-called stochiometric hydrates such
as ammonia hydrate, and pure condensates. We also use a statistical
thermodynamic approach to constrain the composition of multiple guest
clathrates formed in the solar nebula. We then infer that krypton and xenon,
that are expected to condense in the 20-30 K temperature range in the solar
nebula, are trapped in clathrates at higher temperatures than 50 K. Once
formed, these ices either were accreted by Saturn or remained embedded in its
surrounding subnebula until they found their way into the regular satellites
growing around Saturn. In order to explain the carbon monoxide and primordial
argon deficiencies of Titan's atmosphere, we suggest that the satellite was
formed from icy planetesimals initially produced in the solar nebula and that
were partially devolatilized at a temperature not exceeding 50 K during their
migration within Saturn's subnebula. The observed deficiencies of Titan's
atmosphere in krypton and xenon could result from other processes that may have
occurred both prior or after the completion of Titan. Thus, krypton and xenon
may have been sequestrated in the form of XH3+ complexes in the solar nebula
gas phase, causing the formation of noble gas-poor planetesimals ultimately
accreted by Titan. Alternatively, krypton and xenon may have also been trapped
efficiently in clathrates located on the satellite's surface or in its
atmospheric haze.

$(x,y)\in E$ for each $x\neq y$. If $W$ is $k$-uniform (each letter of $W$

shown that a graph is representable if and only if it is $k$-representable for
some $k$. Minimum $k$ for which a representable graph $G$ is $k$-representable
is called its representation number.
  In this paper we give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of
orientations. Namely, we show that a graph is representable if and only if it
admits an orientation into a so-called \emph{semi-transitive digraph}. This
allows us to prove a number of results about representable graphs, not the
least that 3-colorable graphs are representable. We also prove that the
representation number of a graph on $n$ nodes is at most $n$, from which one
concludes that the recognition problem for representable graphs is in NP. This
bound is tight up to a constant factor, as we present a graph whose
representation number is $n/2$.
  We also answer several questions, in particular, on representability of the
Petersen graph and local permutation representability.

Defined by
analogy to classical random walk, a quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum
process on a graph. Both random and quantum walks can be defined either in
continuous or discrete time. But whereas a continuous-time random walk can be
obtained as the limit of a sequence of discrete-time random walks, the two
types of quantum walk appear fundamentally different, owing to the need for
extra degrees of freedom in the discrete-time case.
  In this article, I describe a precise correspondence between continuous- and
discrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs. Using this correspondence, I
show that continuous-time quantum walk can be obtained as an appropriate limit
of discrete-time quantum walks. The correspondence also leads to a new
technique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, giving efficient simulations
even in cases where the Hamiltonian is not sparse. The complexity of the
simulation is linear in the total evolution time, an improvement over
simulations based on high-order approximations of the Lie product formula. As
applications, I describe a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm for element
distinctness and show how to optimally simulate continuous-time query
algorithms of a certain form in the conventional quantum query model. Finally,
I discuss limitations of the method for simulating Hamiltonians with negative
matrix elements, and present two problems that motivate attempting to
circumvent these limitations.

Pictor A, where the relativistic jet that originates at the nucleus terminates
in an interaction with the intergalactic medium, a so-called radio galaxy hot
spot. This image provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object
to date (16 pc), more than three times better than previous VLBI observations
of similar objects. The north-west Pictor A hot spot is resolved into a complex
set of compact components, seen to coincide with the bright part of the hot
spot imaged at arcsecond-scale resolution with the VLA. In addition to a
comparison with VLA data, we compare our VLBA results with data from the HST
and Chandra telescopes, as well as new Spitzer data. The presence of pc-scale
components in the hot spot, identifying regions containing strong shocks in the
fluid flow, leads us to explore the suggestion that they represent sites of
synchrotron X-ray production, contributing to the integrated X-ray flux of the
hot spot, along with X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton scattering. This
scenario provides a natural explanation for the radio morphology of the hot
spot and its integrated X-ray emission, leading to very different predictions
for the higher energy X-ray spectrum compared to previous studies. From the
sizes of the individual pc-scale components and their angular spread, we
estimate that the jet width at the hot spot is in the range 70 - 700 pc, which
is comparable to similar estimates in PKS 2153-69, 3C 205, and 4C 41.17. The
lower limit in this range arises from the suggestion that the jet may dither in
its direction as it passes through hot spot backflow material close to the jet

maximum-minimum principle of mixed finite element formulations. In particular,
we address non-negative solutions (which is a special case of the
maximum-minimum principle) of mixed finite element formulations. The discrete
maximum-minimum principle is the discrete version of the maximum-minimum
principle.
  In this paper we present two non-negative mixed finite element formulations
for tensorial diffusion equations based on constrained optimization techniques
(in particular, quadratic programming). These proposed mixed formulations
produce non-negative numerical solutions on arbitrary meshes for low-order
(i.e., linear, bilinear and trilinear) finite elements. The first formulation
is based on the Raviart-Thomas spaces, and is obtained by adding a non-negative
constraint to the variational statement of the Raviart-Thomas formulation. The
second non-negative formulation based on the variational multiscale
formulation.
  For the former formulation we comment on the affect of adding the
non-negative constraint on the local mass balance property of the
Raviart-Thomas formulation. We also study the performance of the active set
strategy for solving the resulting constrained optimization problems. The
overall performance of the proposed formulation is illustrated on three
canonical test problems.

Math",,,,"math.AG math.AT math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We start to study the problem of classifying smooth proper varieties over a
field k from the standpoint of A^1-homotopy theory. Motivated by the
topological theory of surgery, we discuss the problem of classifying up to
isomorphism all smooth proper varieties having a specified A^1-homotopy type.
Arithmetic considerations involving the sheaf of A^1-connected components lead
us to introduce several different notions of connectedness in A^1-homotopy
theory. We provide concrete links between these notions, connectedness of
points by chains of affine lines, and various rationality properties of
algebraic varieties (e.g., rational connectedness).
  We introduce the notion of an A^1-h-cobordism, an algebro-geometric analog of
the topological notion of h-cobordism, and use it as a tool to produce
non-trivial A^1-weak equivalences of smooth proper varieties. Also, we give
explicit computations of refined A^1-homotopy invariants, such as the
A^1-fundamental sheaf of groups, for some A^1-connected varieties. We observe
that the A^1-fundamental sheaf of groups plays a central yet mysterious role in
the structure of A^1-h-cobordisms. As a consequence of these observations, we
completely solve the classification problem for rational smooth proper surfaces
over an algebraically closed field: while there exist arbitrary dimensional
moduli of such surfaces, there are only countably many A^1-homotopy types, each
uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of its A^1-fundamental sheaf of
groups.

collided packets in random-access wireless networks. In a collision,
overlapping signals from several sources are received simultaneously at a

recover the individual packets. CRESM can be adopted in 802.11 networks without
modification of the transmitter design; only a simple DSP technique is needed
at the receiver to decode the overlapping signals. Our simulations indicate
that CRESM has better BER performance than the simplistic Successive
Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique that treats interference as noise,
for almost all SNR regimes. The implication of CRESM for random-access
networking is significant: in general, using CRESM to resolve collisions of up

transmitters are allowed to transmit more aggressively in the MAC protocol.

receiver to determine the rate at which packets should be sent into the
network. Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements)
is essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and
avoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a
TCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer
holds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the
protocol. In fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is
to bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to
conceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders
arbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows,
leading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal
treatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism
to force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect
acknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would
be identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender
generates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could
generate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender;
the sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof
would indicate a cheating receiver. The scheme is very efficient in the sense
that the TCP sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the
proofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. The scheme is
based on an aggregate authenticator. In addition, the proposed solution can be
applied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring correct
feedback.

convergence. We propose three changes to the seed conjugate gradient method:
only the first right-hand side is used for seeding, this system is solved past
convergence, and the roundoff error is controlled with some

its route depends on the level of congestion of the nodes of the route. Since
several classes of connections going through the nodes of the network are

established. It is shown that, as the number of connections goes to infinity,
the behavior of the different classes of connections can be represented by the
solution of an unusual nonlinear stochastic differential equation depending not

Existence and uniqueness results for the solutions of these equations are
derived. Properties of their invariant distributions are investigated and it is

diverse set of extragalactic sources whose infrared spectra are dominated by
line emission of molecular hydrogen (H2). The absence or relative weakness of
typical signs of star formation (like dust features, lines of ionized gas)
suggest the presence of large quantities of H2 gas with no (or very little)
associated star formation. We use the Stephan's Quintet (SQ) galaxy collision
to define a physical framework to describe the H2 formation and emission in
galaxy-wide shocks. SQ observations show that exceptionally turbulent H2 gas is
coexisting with a hot, X-ray emitting plasma. The extreme mid-IR H2 emission
from the shock exceeds that of the X-rays. These observations set a new light
on the contribution of H2 to the cooling of the interstellar medium, on the
relation between molecular gas and star formation, and on the energetics of
galaxy formation.
  These observations can be interpreted by considering that the shock is moving
through an inhomogeneous medium. They suggest that most of the shock energy is
transferred to bulk kinetic energy of the H2 gas. The turbulent energy of the
post-shock gas drives a mass cycle across the different gas phases where H2 is
forming out of the hot/warm gas. This interpretation puts the H2 emission into
a broader context including optical and X-ray observations. We propose that the
turbulence in the clouds is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from
the bulk motion of the gas and that the dissipation of this turbulent energy in
turn is powering the H2 emission.

geometrically modelled as space coordinates that are not superposed by
automorphisms. As there is only one type of coordinates in Riemannian geometry
and only three types of coordinates in pseudo-Riemannian one, a multiple
fibered semi-Riemannian geometry is the most appropriate one for the treatment
of more then three different physical quantities as unified geometrical field
theory.
  Semi-Euclidean geometry $^{3}R_5^4$ with 1-dimensional fiber $x^5$ and
4-dimensional Minkowski space-time as a base is naturally interpreted as

general relativity pseudo-Riemannian space-time $^{3}V^4,$ and 1-dimensional
fiber $x^5,$ responsible for the electromagnetism, provides the unified field
theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. Unlike Kaluza-Klein theories, where
the 5-th coordinate appears in nondegenerate Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian
geometry, the theory based on semi-Riemannian geometry is free from defects of
the former. In particular, scalar field does not arise.

sufficient experimental data that it may be possible to identify the important

paper we address a number of the important issues. One important characteristic
is the Fe-As distance (or more abstractly the pnictogen (Pn) height $z$(Pn));
we present results for the effect of $z$(Pn) on the electronic structure,
energetics, and Fe magnetic moment. We also study LaOFeAs under pressure, and
investigate the effects of both electron and hole doping within the virtual
crystal approximation. The electric field gradients for all atoms in the
LaOFeAs compound are presented (undoped and doped) and compared with available
data. The observed $(\pi,\pi,\pi)$ magnetic order is studied and compared with
the computationally simpler $(\pi,\pi,0)$ order which is probably a very good
model in most respects. We investigate the crucial role of the pnictogen atom
in this class, and predict the structures and properties of the N and Sb
counterparts that have not yet been reported experimentally. At a certain
volume a gap opens at the Fermi level in LaOFeN, separating bonding from
antibonding bands and suggesting directions for a better simple understanding
of the seemingly intricate electronic structure of this system. Finally, we
address briefly on the possible effects of post-lanthanum rare earths, which

The depth of the absorption toward the quasar NE image increased by a factor of
~3 in 1998-1999 and subsequently decreased by a factor >=6 between 2003 and
2006. These changes were echoed by similar variations in the absorption line
wings toward the SW image. Most likely, these variations result from a motion
of the quasar images with respect to the foreground galaxy, which could be due
to a sporadic ejection of bright plasmons by the background quasar. VLBA
observations have shown that the separation between the NE and SW images
changed in 1997 by as much as 0.2 mas within a few months. Assuming that
motions of similar amplitude occurred in 1999 and 2003, we argue that the

slowing down of the dynamics and at low interaction strength by the high
nucleation barrier. We find that the crystallization is enhanced by the
metastable gas-liquid binodal by means of a two-stage crystallization process.
First, the formation of a dense liquid is observed and second the crystal
nucleates within the dense fluid. In addition, we find at low colloid packing
fractions a fluid of clusters, and at higher colloid packing fractions a
percolating network due to an arrested gas-liquid phase separation that we
identify with gelation. We find that this arrest is due to crystallization at
low interaction energy and it is caused by a slowing down of the dynamics at
high interaction strength. Likewise, we observe that the clusters which are
formed at low colloid packing fractions are crystalline at low interaction
energy, but glassy at high interaction energy. The clusters coalesce upon
encounter.

spatiotemporal patterns, is analyzed by a periodically forced two-dimensional

is introduced to describe complex features of the dynamics of the vector
transmitted dengue epidemics, known to be very sensitive to seasonal variables.
The three coupled levels represent the human, the adult and immature vector
populations. The dynamics includes external seasonality forcing (rainfall
intensity data), human and mosquito mobility, and vector control effects. The
model parameters, even if bounded to well defined intervals obtained from
reported data, can be selected to reproduce specific epidemic outbursts. In the
current study, explicit results are obtained by comparison with actual data
retrieved from the time-series of dengue epidemics in two cities in Brazil. The
results show fluctuations that are not captured by mean-field models. It also
reveals the qualitative behavior of the spatiotemporal patterns of the
epidemics. In the extreme situation of absence of external periodic drive, the
model predicts completely distinct long time evolution. The model is robust in
the sense that it is able to reproduce the time series of dengue epidemics of
different cities, provided the forcing term takes into account the local
rainfall modulation. Finally, the dependence between epidemics threshold and
vector control undergoes a transition from power law to stretched exponential
behavior due to human mobility effect.

flow in a helical magnetic field (HMRI) using the inductionless approximation
defined by a zero magnetic Prandtl number (Pm=0). The Chebyshev collocation
method is used to calculate the eigenvalue spectrum for small amplitude
perturbations. First, we carry out a detailed conventional linear stability
analysis with respect to perturbations in the form of Fourier modes that
corresponds to the convective instability which is not in general
self-sustained. The helical magnetic field is found to extend the instability
to a relatively narrow range beyond its purely hydrodynamic limit defined by
the Rayleigh line. There is not only a lower critical threshold at which HMRI
appears but also an upper one at which it disappears again. The latter
distinguishes the HMRI from a magnetically-modified Taylor vortex flow. Second,
we find an absolute instability threshold as well. In the hydrodynamically
unstable regime before the Rayleigh line, the threshold of absolute instability
is just slightly above the convective one although the critical wave length of
the former is noticeably shorter than that of the latter. Beyond the Rayleigh
line the lower threshold of absolute instability rises significantly above the
corresponding convective one while the upper one descends significantly below
its convective counterpart. As a result, the extension of the absolute HMRI
beyond the Rayleigh line is considerably shorter than that of the convective
instability. The absolute HMRI is supposed to be self-sustained and, thus,

magnetoelastic coupling in ferromagnetic/piezoelectric hybrids to realize a

consist of polycrystalline nickel thin films evaporated onto piezoelectric
actuators. The magnetic properties of these multifunctional hybrids are
investigated at room temperature as a function of the voltage controlled stress
exerted by the actuator on the Ni film. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy
shows that the magnetic easy axis in the Ni film plane is rotated by 90 degree
upon changing the polarity of the voltage Vp applied to the actuator. In other
words, the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the Ni film can be inverted
via the application of an appropriate voltage Vp. Using SQUID magnetometry, the
evolution of the magnetization vector is recorded as a function of Vp and of
the external magnetic field. Changing Vp allows to reversibly adjust the
magnetization orientation in the Ni film plane within a range of approximately
70 degree. All magnetometry data can be quantitatively understood in terms of
the magnetic free energy determined from the ferromagnetic resonance
experiments. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in hybrid

quantum fluctuation effects in the nonrelativistic, attractive Fermi gas at and
near unitarity. We extend the previous results by calculating the
next-to-leading order corrections to the critical temperature along the whole
BCS-BEC crossover. We demonstrate explicitly that the extrapolation from the
mean-field approximation, based on the $1/N$ expansion, provides a useful
approximation scheme only on the BCS side of the crossover. We then apply the
technique to the study of strongly interacting relativistic many-fermion
systems. Having in mind the application to color superconductivity in cold
dense quark matter, we develop, within a simple model, a formalism suitable to
compare the effects of order parameter fluctuations in phases with different
pairing patterns. Our main conclusion is that the relative correction to the
critical temperature is to a good accuracy proportional to the mean-field ratio
of the critical temperature and the chemical potential. As a consequence, it is
significant even rather deep in the BCS regime, where phenomenologically
interesting values of the quark-quark coupling are expected. Possible impact on
the phase diagram of color-superconducting quark matter is discussed.

our simulations is very similar on large-scales. The convective flows driven by
the jets advect gas and metals from the central galaxy to distances beyond 1.5
Mpc within the cluster. Intermittent jets are able to distribute metals to
grater radii. The metal injection has effects on the general metal abundances
present in the ICM, the faster the metal replenishment time the higher the
metal abundance. Although metallicity gradients in the very central regions of
cool core clusters are likely to be shaped by less-energetic phenomena, we find
evidence in our simulations for metallicity gradients similar to those observed
out to ~400 kpc radius. The metal distribution details of the central galaxy
have no effects on the dynamical evolution of the ICM metals.

allows us to construct explicit moduli spaces of pure equivariant sheaves on
$X$ corepresenting natural moduli functors (similar to work of Payne in the
case of equivariant vector bundles). The action of the algebraic torus on $X$
lifts to the moduli space of all Gieseker stable sheaves on $X$ and we express
its fixed point locus explicitly in terms of moduli spaces of pure equivariant

bundle on the side of the GIT problem, which precisely recovers Gieseker
stability. In the case of torsion free equivariant sheaves, we can always
construct such equivariant line bundles. As a by-product, we get a
combinatorial description of the fixed point locus of the moduli space of
$\mu$-stable reflexive sheaves on $X$. As an application, we show in a sequel
how these methods can be used to compute generating functions of Euler

graphene quantum dots (QDs) defined by electrostatic gates is studied
analytically in terms of the Dirac equation. Due to the absence of sharp edges
in these types of QDs, the valley degree of freedom is a good quantum number.
We show that its degeneracy is efficiently and controllably broken by a
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the graphene plane. This opens up a
feasible route to create well-defined and well controlled spin- and
valley-qubits in graphene QDs. We also point out the similarities and
differences in the spectrum between single- and bilayer graphene quantum dots.
Striking in the case of bilayer graphene is the anomalous bulk Landau level
(LL) that crosses the gap which results in crossings of QD states with this
bulk LL at large magnetic fields in stark contrast to the single-layer case
where this LL is absent. The tunability of the gap in the bilayer case allows
us to observe different regimes of level spacings directly related to the
formation of a pronounced ``Mexican hat'' in the bulk bandstructure. We discuss
the applicability of such QDs to control and measure the valley isospin and
their potential use for hosting and controlling spin qubits.

off nuclei producing a nuclear recoil with energies up to a few 10 keV with a

in the energy region of interest. The Dark Matter experiment CRESST (Cryogenic
Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers) and the EURECA project
(European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array) are aimed at the direct
detection of WIMPs with the help of very sensitive modularised cryogenic
detectors that basically consist of a transition edge sensor (TES) in
combination with a massive absorber crystal. In the CRESST experiment the
search for coherent WIMP-nucleon scattering events is validated by the
detection of two processes. In the scintillating absorber single crystal,
CaWO_4, heat (phonons) and scintillation light are produced and detected with
two independent cryogenic detectors: a phonon channel and a separate light
channel. The development of such cryogenic detectors and the potential
ton-scale production are investigated in this paper. To decouple the TES
production from the choice of the target material in order to avoid heating
cycles of the absorber crystal and to allow pretesting of the TESs, a composite
detector design (CDD) for the detector production has been developed and
studied. An existing thermal detector model has been extended to the CDD, in
order to investigate, understand, and optimize the performance of composite
detectors. This extended model, which has been worked out in detail, can be
expected to provide a considerable help when tailoring composite detectors to
the requirements of various experiments.

the kinetics of the Na+ ion depletion layer formation under the anode was
studied in-situ by means of ac impedance spectroscopy. One important finding is
a linear relation between the depletion layer thickness and the applied
voltage, which is in contrast to the predictions of standard space charge
theory. The average electric field in the layer is independent of the voltage
and is close to the dielectric breakdown field of alkali ion conducting
glasses. Furthermore, we observe that the thickness of the depletion layer is
established on a much shorter time scale than the resistance. We explain these
results by assuming that the huge electric fields created under the anode
during Na+ ion depletion lead to a strong increase of the electronic mobility
in the layer and to charge compensation via extraction of electrons. It is
shown that in the initial stages of the depletion process, a relative Na+ ion
depletion of only 400 ppm is sufficient to generate electric fields of the
order of the dielectric breakdown field.

the highly variable dips durations and depths seen from this low-mass X-ray
binary. Deep dips were present during two observations, shallow dips during one
and no dips were detected during the remaining two observations. At high (1-4
s) time resolution ``shallow dips'' are seen to include a few, very rapid, deep
dips whilst the ``deep'' dips consist of many similar very rapid, deep,
fluctuations. The folded V-band Optical Monitor light curves obtained when the
source was undergoing deep, shallow and no detectable dipping exhibit
sinusoid-like variations with different amplitudes and phases. We fit EPIC
spectra obtained from ""persistent"" or dip-free intervals with a model
consisting of disc-blackbody and thermal comptonisation components together
with Gaussian emission features at 1 and 6.6 keV modified by absorption due to
cold and photo-ionised material. None of the spectral parameters appears to be
strongly correlated with the dip depth except for the temperature of the disc
blackbody which is coolest (kT ~ 1.8 keV) when deep dips are present and
warmest (kT ~ 2.1 keV) when no dips are detectable. We propose that the changes
in both disc temperature and optical modulation could be explained by the
presence of a tilted accretion disc in the system. We provide a revised
estimate of the orbital period of 0.16388875 +/- 0.00000017 day.

nonrelativistic potential V(|r1-r2|) between point particles at positions r1
and r2 can be extended to a Lagrangian system which is invariant under Lorentz
transformation through order v^2/c^2. However, this invariance requires the
introduction of velocity-dependent and acceleration-dependent forces between
particles. The textbook treatments of ""relativistic mechanics"" can be
misleading; the discussions usually deal with only one particle experiencing
prescribed forces and so make no mention of these additional velocity- and
acceleration-dependent forces. A simple example for a situation analogous to a
parallel-plate capacitor is analyzed for all the conservation laws of Galilean
invariance or Lorentz invariance. For this system, Galilean invariance requires
that the mechanical momentum is given by pmech=mv but places no restriction on
the position-dependent potential function. On the other hand, Lorentz
invariance requires that the mechanical momentum is given by
pmech=mv/(1-v^2/c^2)^1/2, and in addition requires that the potential function
is exactly the Coulomb potential V(|r1-r2|)=k/|r1-r2|. It is also noted that
the transmission of the interparticle-force signal at the speed of light again
suggests a special role for the Coulomb potential. A nonrelativistic particle
system interacting through the Coulomb potential becomes the Darwin Lagrangian
when extended to a system relativistic through order v^2/c^2, and then allows
extension to classical electrodynamics as a fully Lorentz-invariant theory of
interacting particles.

bi-dimensional and their parts (electrodes and 'active region') are periodic in
the direction perpendicular to the transport direction. To calculate the
conductance we use the Green's Functions Landauer-B$\ddot{u}$ttiker formalism.
The electronic structure of the junction is modeled by a tight binding
Hamiltonian. For a simple junction we find that the conductance decays
exponentially with semiconductor thickness. For double and triple junctions,
the conductance oscillates with the metal in-between thickness, and presents
peaks for which the conductance is enhanced by 1-4 orders of magnitude. We find
that when there is a conductance peak, the conductance is higher to that
corresponding to a simple junction. The maximum ratio between the conductance
of a double junction and the conductance of a simple junction is 146 %, while
for a triple junction it is 323 %. These oscillations in the conductance are
explained in terms of the energy spectrum of the junction's active region.

models is the average efficiency of accretion onto SMBH (super-massive black
holes). This can be inferred from the shape of broad relativistic Fe lines seen
in X-ray spectra of AGN (active galactic nuclei). Several studies have tried to
measure the mean Fe emission properties of AGN at different depths with very
different results. We compute the mean Fe emission from a large and
representative sample of AGN X-ray spectra up to redshift ~ 3.5. We developed a
method of computing the rest-frame X-ray average spectrum and applied it to a
large sample (more than 600 objects) of type 1 AGN from two complementary
medium sensitivity surveys based on XMM-Newton data, the AXIS and XWAS samples.
This method makes use of medium-to-low quality spectra without needing to fit
complex models to the individual spectra but with computing a mean spectrum for
the whole sample. Extensive quality tests were performed by comparing real to
simulated data, and a significance for the detection of any feature over an
underlying continuum was derived. We detect with a 99.9% significance an
unresolved Fe K-alpha emission line around 6.4 keV with an EW ~ 90 eV, but we
find no compelling evidence of any significant broad relativistic emission line
in the final average spectrum. Deviations from a power law around the narrow
line are best represented by a reflection component arising from cold or
low-ionization material. We estimate an upper limit for the EW of any
relativistic line of 400 eV at a 3 sigma confidence level. We also marginally
detect the so-called Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect on the EW for the unresolved
emission line, which appears weaker for higher luminosity AGN.

reciprocal motion (a motion in which the sequence of body configurations
remains identical under time reversal) cannot propel itself in a viscous fluid
in the limit of negligible inertia; this result is known as Purcell's scallop
theorem. In this limit, the Reynolds numbers based on the fluid inertia and on
the body inertia are all zero. Previous studies characterized the breakdown of
the scallop theorem with fluid inertia. In this paper we show that, even in the
absence of fluid inertia, certain dense bodies undergoing reciprocal motion are
able to swim. Using Lorentz's reciprocal theorem, we first derive the general
differential equations that govern the locomotion kinematics of a dense
swimmer. We demonstrate that no reciprocal swimming is possible if the body
motion consists only of tangential surface deformation (squirming). We then
apply our general formulation to compute the locomotion of four simple
swimmers, each with a different spatial asymmetry, that perform normal surface
deformations. We show that the resulting swimming speeds (or rotation rates)
scale as the first power of a properly defined ""swimmer Reynolds number'',
demonstrating thereby a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with body
inertia.

supernovae, that allows an interpretation of its astrophysical parameters
within the Bethe and Wilson scenario for the explosion, and that leads to a
reasonable (smooth) behavior of the average energy and of the luminosity curve.
We apply it to analyze the events observed by Kamiokande-II, IMB and Baksan
detectors in correlation with SN1987A. For the first time, we consider in the
same analysis all data characteristics: times, energies and angles of the
observed events. We account for the presence of background and evaluate the
impact of neutrino oscillations. The hypothesis that the initial luminous phase
of emission (accretion) is absent can be rejected at the 2 % significance
level. Without the need to impose external priors in the likelihood analysis,
the best-fit values of the astrophysical parameters are found to be in
remarkable agreement with the expectations of the standard core-collapse
scenario; in particular, the electron antineutrino-sphere radius is 16 km, the
duration of the accretion phase is found to be 0.55 s, and the initial
accreting mass is 0.22 M(sun). Similarly the total energy emitted in neutrinos
is 2.2*10^{53} erg, again close to the expectations. The errors on the
parameters are evaluated and found to be relatively large, consistently with
the limited number of detected events; the two dimensional confidence regions,
that demonstrate the main correlations between the parameters, are also given.
