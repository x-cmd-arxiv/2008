biases to measure the redshift-space distortion parameter
beta=f/b=(dlnD/dlna)/b (where D is the growth rate and a the expansion factor),
to a much better precision than one could achieve with a single tracer, to an
arbitrary precision in the low noise limit. In combination with the power
spectrum of the tracers this allows a much more precise measurement of the
bias-free velocity divergence power spectrum, f^2 P_m - in fact, in the low
noise limit f^2 P_m can be measured as well as would be possible if velocity
divergence was observed directly, with rms improvement factor ~[5.2(beta^2+2
beta+2)/beta^2]^0.5 (e.g., ~10 times better than a single tracer for beta=0.4).
This would allow a high precision determination of f D as a function of
redshift with an error as low as 0.1%. We find up to two orders of magnitude
improvement in Figure of Merit for the Dark Energy equation of state relative
to Stage II, a factor of several better than other proposed Stage IV Dark
Energy surveys. The ratio b_2/b_1 will be determined with an even greater
precision than beta, producing, when measured as a function of scale, an
exquisitely sensitive probe of the onset of non-linear bias. We also extend in
more detail previous work on the use of the same technique to measure
non-Gaussianity. Currently planned redshift surveys are typically designed with
signal to noise of unity on scales of interest, and are not optimized for this
technique. Our results suggest that this strategy may need to be revisited as
there are large gains to be achieved from surveys with higher number densities
of galaxies.

We use different tracers, such as Ha, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared
(IR) emissions at various wavelengths, to study the dust and star-formation
(SF) conditions throughout the disk of M33. Methods. We derive the radial
distribution of dust, of the old and young stellar population using Spitzer and
GALEX data, complemented by ground-based optical data and available surveys of
atomic and molecular gas. We separate the contribution of discrete sources to
the IR brightness from the diffuse emission. Results. At 8 and 24 um, discrete
sources account for 40% of the IR emission in the innermost 3 kpc, and for 20%
further out. We find that stochastic emission from very small grains in the
diffuse interstellar medium accounts for only 10% of the diffuse 24 um
emission, and that dusty circumstellar shells of unresolved, evolved AGB stars
(carbon stars) are a viable alternative. The 8 um profile suggests that PAH
emission declines faster with radius than the dust continuum. In annular
regions, 0.24 kpc wide, we find a mean extinction value for stellar continuum
AV = 0.25 mag with a weak dependence on radius, consistent with the shallow
metallicity gradient observed. Dust opacity derived from the 160 um emission
decreases instead by a factor 10 from the center to edge of the SF disk.
Conclusions. Using extinction corrected UV and Ha maps we find the global SF
rate in M33, over the last 100 Myr, to be 0.45 +- 0.10 M yr-1. FIR (far-IR) and
TIR (total-IR) luminosities can trace SF even though a high conversion factor
is required to recover the effective rate. If carbon stars are powering the
diffuse 24 um emission in M33 this can trace star formation 1 Gyr ago and
provide a more complete view of the SF history of the galaxy. [abridged]

than by vacuum expectation values of pseudomoduli at loop level. As a
complement of the recent result by Shih, we show that there must be a field in
the theory with R-charge different from zero and two in order for R-symmetry
breaking to occur, no matter whether the breaking happens at tree or loop
level. We review the example by CDFM, and construct two types of tree level
R-symmetry breaking models with a wide range of parameters and free of runaway
problem. And the R-symmetry is broken everywhere on the pseudomoduli space in
these models. This provides a rich set of candidates for SUSY model building
and phenomenology.

We apply a precise and accurate technique to calculate the correlation

Our reliable results are distributed in the range 1.5<Dc<2.0. We get
significant variations in the fractal dimension among galaxies, contrary to a
universal picture sometimes claimed in literature. The faintest galaxies tend
to distribute their HII regions in more clustered (less uniform) patterns.
Moreover, the fractal dimension for the brightest HII regions within the same
galaxy seems to be smaller than for the faintest ones suggesting some kind of

is present, consistent with the varying aspect of the donor star's heated face.
We model the contributions of a disk and donor star to these optical bands. To
produce the observed modulation amplitudes, we conclude that the donor must be
irradiated by an external flux 2 orders of magnitude greater than provided by
the measured X-ray luminosity. A possible explanation for this irradiation is
that the radio pulsar mechanism becomes active during the quiescent state as
suggested by Burderi et al., with relativistic particles heating the donor's
day-side face. Our modelling constrains the binary inclination to be between 36
and 67 degrees. We obtain estimates for the pulsar mass of >2.2 solar masses
(although this limit is sensitive to the source's distance), consistent with
the accelerated NS cooling in this system indicated by X-ray observations. We
also estimate the donor mass to be in the range of 0.07-0.11 solar masses,
providing further indications that the system underwent non-standard binary
evolution to reach its current state.

X-ray spectrum of 1808 is similar to that observed in quiescence in 2001 and
2006, describable by an absorbed power-law with photon index 1.74+-0.11 and
unabsorbed X-ray luminosity L_X=7.9+-0.7*10^{31} ergs/s, for N_H=1.3*10^{21}

we constrain any thermally emitting neutron star with a hydrogen atmosphere to
have a temperature less than 30 eV and L_{NS}(0.01-10 keV)<6.2*10^{30} ergs/s.
A thermal plasma model also gives an acceptable fit to the continuum. Adding a
neutron star component to the plasma model produces less stringent constraints
on the neutron star; a temperature of 36^{+4}_{-8} eV and L_{NS}(0.01-10

of neutron star heating and cooling, the constraints on the thermal luminosity
of 1808 and 1H 1905+000 require strongly enhanced cooling in the cores of these
neutron stars.
  We compile data from the literature on the mass transfer rates and quiescent
thermal flux of the largest possible sample of transient neutron star LMXBs. We
identify a thermal component in the quiescent spectrum of the accreting

cooling model. The contrast between the cooling rates of IGR J00291+5934 and

interpreted as arising from differences in the binary evolution history or
initial neutron star mass in these otherwise similar systems.

travelling waves on unbounded domains, one must overcome two main difficulties:
the presence of embedded neutral eigenvalues and the time-dependence of the
associated linear operator. This problem is studied in the context of
time-periodic Lax shocks in systems of viscous conservation laws. Using spatial
dynamics and a decomposition into separate Floquet eigenmodes, it is shown that
the linear evolution for the time-dependent operator can be represented using a
contour integral similar to that of the standard time-independent case. By
decomposing the resulting Green's distribution, the leading order behavior
associated with the embedded eigenvalues is extracted. Sharp pointwise bounds
are then obtained, which are used to prove that time-periodic Lax shocks are
linearly and nonlinearly stable under the necessary conditions of spectral
stability and minimal multiplicity of the translational eigenvalues. The latter
conditions hold, for example, for small-oscillation time-periodic waves that
emerge through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation from a family of
time-independent Lax shocks of possibly large amplitude.

invariant operators in N=4 SYM. Our approach is based on the action of the
superalgebra on the states of the theory and thus it can be also applied to
resolve the mixing in the dual string description. As an example, we focus on
the supermultiplet containing the BMN operators with two impurities. On the
field theory side, we derive the leading planar quantum corrections to the
naive expression of the highest weight state. Then we use the same prescription
in the BMN limit of the AdS5xS5 string theory and derive the form of the
2-impurity highest weight state. The string expression matches nicely the SYM
result and provides a prediction for the mixing due to higher order quantum
corrections in field theory.

Measurements of strong suppression of inclusive hadron distributions and
di-hadron correlations at high $p_{T}$ have already provided evidence for
partonic energy loss. However, these measurements suffer from well-known
geometric biases due to the competition of energy loss and fragmentation. These
biases can be avoided if the jets are reconstructed independently of their
fragmentation details - quenched or unquenched. In this paper, we discuss
modern jet reconstruction algorithms (cone and sequential recombination) and
their corresponding background subtraction techniques required by the high
multiplicities of heavy ion collisions. We review recent results from the STAR

space and estimate the corresponding phase-space density. It compares SPH
methods to 6D Delaunay tessellation on statical and dynamical realisation of
single halo profiles, paying attention to the unknown scaling, S_G, used to
relate the spatial dimensions to the velocity dimensions. The methods with
local adaptive metric provide the best phase-space estimators. They make use of
a Shannon entropy criterion combined with a binary tree partitioning and with
SPH interpolation using 10-40 neighbours. Local scaling implemented by such
methods, which enforces local isotropy of the distribution function, can vary
by about one order of magnitude in different regions within the system. It
presents a bimodal distribution, in which one component is dominated by the
main part of the halo and the other one is dominated by the substructures.
While potentially better than SPH techniques, since it yields an optimal
estimate of the local softening volume (and the local number of neighbours
required to perform the interpolation), the Delaunay tessellation in fact
poorly estimates the phase-space distribution function. Indeed, it requires,
the choice of a global scaling S_G. We propose two methods to estimate S_G that
yield a good global compromise. However, the Delaunay interpolation still
remains quite sensitive to local anisotropies in the distribution. We also
compare 6D phase-space density estimation with the proxy, Q=rho/sigma^3, where
rho is the local density and 3 sigma^2 is the local 3D velocity dispersion. We
show that Q only corresponds to a rough approximation of the true phase-space
density, and is not able to capture all the details of the distribution in
phase-space, ignoring, in particular, filamentation and tidal streams.

marginally consistent with typical values of Type-I objects. An absorption
component with an uncommonly high equivalent Hydrogen column,
n_H=5.82(+0.12/-0.11)x10^22 cm-2, is affecting the soft part of the spectrum.
Additionally, two warm absorption components are also present. The lower
ionised one has an ionisation parameter of Log(U)=2.14(+0.06/-0.07) and an
outflowing velocity of v=3200(+600/-200) km/s. Two absorption lines located at
~6.7 and ~7.0 keV can be modelled with the highly ionised absorber. The
ionisation parameter and outflowing velocity of the gas measured are
Log(U)=3.26(+0.19/-0.15) and v=1700(+600/-400) km/s, respectively. Four
emission lines were also detected in the soft energy band. The most likely
explanation for these emission lines is that they are associated with an
outflowing gas with a velocity of ~2000 km/s. The data suggest that the same
gas which is causing the absorption could also being responsible of these
emission features. Finally, the spectrum shows the presence of a relativistic
iron emission line likely originated in the accretion disc of a Kerr BH with an
inclination of ~25 deg. We propose a model to explain the observed X-ray
properties which invokes the presence of a two-phase outflow with cone-like
structure and a velocity of the order of 2,000-4,000 km/s. The inner layer of
the cone would be less ionised, or even neutral, than the outer layer. The
inclination angle would be lower than the opening angle of the outflowing cone.

originate from quantum fluctuations produced during a phase of the early
universe called inflation. By evolving a wavefunction describing two coupled
Fourier modes of a scalar field forward through an inflationary epoch, we
demonstrate that non-linear effects can result in a generation of entanglement
entropy between modes with different momenta in a scalar field during the
inflationary period when just one of the modes is observed. Through this
mechanism, the field would experience decoherence and appear more like a
classical distribution today; however the mechanism is not sufficiently
efficient to explain classicality. We find that the amount of entanglement
entropy generated scales roughly as a power law S \propto \lambda^{1.75}, where
\lambda is the coupling coefficient of the non-linear potential term. We also
investigate how the entanglement entropy scales with the duration of inflation
and compare various entanglement measures from the literature with the von
Neumann entropy. This demonstration explicitly follows particle creation and
interactions between modes; consequently, the mechanism contributing to the
generation of the von Neumann entropy can be easily seen.

correction-codes for Pauli channels. Specifically, we investigate if correction
of multiple errors in a block is more efficient than using a code that only
corrects one error per block. Block coding with multiple-error correction
cannot increase the efficiency when the qubit error-probability is below a
certain value and the code size fixed. More surprisingly, existing
multiple-error correction codes with a code length equal or less than 256
qubits have lower efficiency than the optimal single-error correcting codes for
any value of the qubit error-probability. We also investigate how efficient
various proposed nondegenerate single-error correcting codes are compared to
the limit set by the code redundancy and by the necessary conditions for
hypothetically existing nondegenerate codes. We find that existing codes are
close to optimal.

spectroscopy shows a single broad (FWHM=5300 km/s) emission line, which is
almost certainly H-alpha at z=1.87. The X-ray spectrum shows evidence of
significant absorption (N_H > 10^{23} cm^{-2}), typical of type 2 AGN, but the
broad H-alpha emission suggests a type 1 AGN classification. The very red

however. We find that simple modelling can successfully reproduce the NIR
continuum and strongly constrain the intrinsic nuclear optical/IR extinction to
A_V~4, which turns out to be much smaller than the expected from the X-ray

to be able to make use of information contained in the visibility phase to
construct high dynamic range images. Radio and optical interferometry are at
the two extremes of phase corruption by the atmosphere. While in radio it is
possible to obtain calibrated phases for the science objects, in the optical
this is currently not possible. Instead, optical interferometry has relied on
closure phase techniques to produce images. Such techniques allow only to
achieve modest dynamic ranges. However, with high contrast objects, for faint
targets or when structure detail is needed, phase referencing techniques as
used in radio interferometry, should theoretically achieve higher dynamic
ranges for the same number of telescopes. Our approach is not to provide
evidence either for or against the hypothesis that phase referenced imaging
gives better dynamic range than closure phase imaging. Instead we wish to
explore the potential of this technique for future optical interferometry and
also because image reconstruction in the optical using phase referencing
techniques has only been performed with limited success. We have generated
simulated, noisy, complex visibility data, analogous to the signal produced in
radio interferometers, using the VLTI as a template. We proceeded with image
reconstruction using the radio image reconstruction algorithms contained in

alternatives (given a fixed experimentation budget) with the goal of picking a
single alternative with the largest possible expected payoff. Approximation
algorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a
linear program that couples the various alternatives together. In this paper we
present an index for this problem, which we call the ratio index, which also
guarantees a constant factor approximation. Index-based policies have the
advantage that a single number (i.e. the index) can be computed for each
alternative irrespective of all other alternatives, and the alternative with
the highest index is experimented upon. This is analogous to the famous Gittins
index for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem.
  The ratio index has several interesting structural properties. First, we show
that it can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Second, we show that with
the appropriate discount factor, the Gittins index and our ratio index are
constant factor approximations of each other, and hence the Gittins index also
gives a constant factor approximation to the budgeted learning problem.
Finally, we show that the ratio index can be used to create an index-based
policy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for the finite horizon version of
the multi-armed bandit problem. Moreover, the policy does not require any
knowledge of the horizon (whereas we compare its performance against an optimal
strategy that is aware of the horizon). This yields the following surprising
result: there is an index-based policy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for
the multi-armed bandit problem, oblivious to the underlying discount factor.

lead to a focusing of the outflow and its reconfinement in a region having a

variability at large distances from the central engine via reflections of the
converging recollimation shock. Possible applications of this model to TeV

extremely good collimation that can explain the reported variability of the

popular non-binary codes in almost all practical applications. The distance
properties of RS codes result in excellent performance under hard-decision
bounded-distance decoding. However, efficient and implementable soft decoding
for high-rate (about 0.9) RS codes over large fields (GF(256), say) continues
to remain a subject of research with a promise of further coding gains. In this
work, our objective is to propose and investigate $2^m$-ary codes with
non-trivial binary trace codes as an alternative to RS codes. We derive bounds
on the rate of a $2^m$-ary code with a non-trivial binary trace code. Then we
construct certain subcodes of RS codes over GF($2^m$) that have a non-trivial
binary trace with distances and rates meeting the derived bounds. The
properties of these subcodes are studied and low-complexity hard-decision and
soft-decision decoders are proposed. The decoders are analyzed, and their
performance is compared with that of comparable RS codes. Our results suggest
that these subcodes of RS codes could be viable alternatives for RS codes in
applications.

understanding of the innerparts of the Sun. Their frequencies would enable the
derivation of constraints on the core physical properties while their
amplitudes can put severe constraints on the properties of the inner convective
region. Our purpose is to determine accurate theoretical amplitudes of solar g
modes and estimate the SOHO observation duration for an unambiguous detection.
We investigate the stochastic excitation of modes by turbulent convection as
well as their damping. Input from a 3D global simulation of the solar
convective zone is used for the kinetic turbulent energy spectrum. Damping is
computed using a parametric description of the nonlocal time-dependent
convection-pulsation interaction. We then provide a theoretical estimation of
the intrinsic, as well as apparent, surface velocity. Asymptotic g-mode
velocity amplitudes are found to be orders of magnitude higher than previous
works. Using a 3D numerical simulation, from the ASH code, we attribute this to
the temporal-correlation between the modes and the turbulent eddies which is
found to follow a Lorentzian law rather than a Gaussian one as previously used.
We also find that damping rates of asymptotic gravity modes are dominated by
radiative losses, with a typical life-time of $3 \times 10^5$ years for the
$\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60 \mu$Hz. The maximum velocity in the considered
frequency range (10-100 $\mu$Hz) is obtained for the $\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60
\mu$Hz and for the $\ell=2$ at $\nu=100 \mu$Hz. Due to uncertainties in the
modeling, amplitudes at maximum i.e. for $\ell=1$ at 60 $\mu$Hz can range from
3 to 6 mm s$^{-1}$.

validate by simulations an extension of the phase diversity technique that uses
long exposure adaptive optics corrected images for sensing quasi-static
aberrations during the scientific observation, in particular for high-contrast
imaging. The principle of the method is that, for a sufficiently long exposure
time, the residual turbulence is averaged into a convolutive component of the
image and that phase diversity estimates the sole static aberrations of
interest. The advantages of such a procedure, compared to the processing of
short-exposure image pairs, are that the separation between static aberrations
and turbulence-induced ones is performed by the long-exposure itself and not
numerically, that only one image pair must be processed, that the estimation
benefits from the high SNR of long-exposure images, and that only the static
aberrations of interest are to be estimated. Long-exposure phase diversity can
also be used as a phasing sensor for a segmented aperture telescope. Thus, it
may be particularly useful for future planet finder projects such as EPICS on
the European ELT.

Hall current. In this Letter, we examine the inverse effect that, in a
ferromagnetic conductor, a charge Hall current is induced by a spin motive
force, or a spin-dependent effective ` electric' field ${\bm E}_{\rm s}$,
arising from the time variation of magnetization texture. By considering
skew-scattering and side-jump processes due to spin-orbit interaction at
impurities, we obtain the Hall current density as $\sigma_{\rm SH} {\bm
n}\times{\bm E}_{\rm s}$, where ${\bm n}$ is the local spin direction and
$\sigma_{\rm SH}$ is the spin Hall conductivity. The Hall angle due to the spin
motive force is enhanced by a factor of $P^{2}$ compared to the conventional
anomalous Hall effect due to the ordinary electric field, where $P$ is the spin
polarization of the current. The Hall voltage is estimated for a field-driven
domain wall oscillation in a ferromagnetic nanowire.

The proof depends on canonical ultraviolet behavior at the boundary. Any system
whose short distance behavior is governed by a fixed point satisfies this

gravity (and maybe electromagnetism and the other gauge fields) might be an
'emergent phenomenon', in the sense of representing a collective behaviour
resulting from a very different microscopic physics. A prominent example of
this approach is the condensed matter scheme for quantum gravity, which
considers the possibility that gravity emerges as an effective low-energy
phenomenon from the quantum vacuum in a way similar to the emergence of
collective excitations in condensed matter systems. This condensed matter view
of the quantum vacuum clearly hints that, while the term 'ether' has been
discredited for about a century, quantum gravity holds many (if not all) of the
characteristics that have led people in the past to label various hypothetical
substances with the term 'ether'. Since the last burst of enthusiasm for an
ether, at the end of the 19th century, was brought to the grave in part by the
performance of a series of important experiments in interferometry, the
suggestion then naturally arises that maybe interferometry could also play a
role in the current discussion on quantum gravity. We will highlight some
aspects of this suggestion in the context of the condensed matter scheme for

In particular, it is a decisive milestone for the implementation of quantum
networks and quantum repeaters. So far, quantum interfaces between light and
atoms have been demonstrated with atomic gases, and with single trapped atoms
in cavities. Here we demonstrate the coherent and reversible mapping of a light
field with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of 10 millions atoms
naturally trapped in a solid. This is achieved by coherently absorbing the
light field in a suitably prepared solid state atomic medium. The state of the
light is mapped onto collective atomic excitations on an optical transition and
stored for a pre-programmed time up of to 1 mu s before being released in a
well defined spatio-temporal mode as a result of a collective interference. The
coherence of the process is verified by performing an interference experiment
with two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. Visibilities of
more than 95% are obtained, which demonstrates the high coherence of the
mapping process at the single photon level. In addition, we show experimentally
that our interface allows one to store and retrieve light fields in multiple
temporal modes. Our results represent the first observation of collective
enhancement at the single photon level in a solid and open the way to multimode
solid state quantum memories as a promising alternative to atomic gases.

relativistic Boltzmann-kinetic equations. One is Marle model, and the other is
Anderson-Witting model. As with Marle model, the temperature of the gain term
was determined from its relation with the dynamic pressure in the framework of
14-moments theory. From numerical results of the relativistic shock layer
problem, behaviors of projected moments in the nonequilibrium region were
clarified. Profiles of the heat flux given by Marle model and Anderson-Witting
model were quite adverse to the profile of the heat flux approximated by
Navier-Stokes-Fourier law. On the other hand, profiles of the heat flux given
by Marle model and Anderson-Witting model were similar to the profile
approximated by Navier-Stokes-Fourier law. Additionally we discuss the
differences between Anderson-Witting model and Marle model by focusing on the
fact that the relaxational rate of the distribution function depends on both
flow velocity and molecular velocity for Anderson-Witting model, while it
depends only on the molecular velocity for Marle model.

invariance and can also have an impact on the symmetries specific to massless
Dirac-like quasiparticles in this material. The paper examines the consequences
of a broken Dirac fermion parity in the framework of the effective boundary
conditions varying from the Berry-Mondragon mass confinement to a zigzag edge.
The parity breaking reflects the structural sublattice asymmetry of zigzag-type
edges and is closely related to the previously predicted time-reversal
symmetric edge states. We calculate the local and global densities of the edge
states and show that they carry a specific polarization, resembling, to some
extent, that of spin-polarized materials. The lack of the parity leads to a
nonanalytical particle-hole asymmetry in the edge-state properties. We use our
findings to interpret recently observed tunneling spectra in zigzag-terminated
graphene. We also propose a graphene-based tunneling device where the
particle-hole asymmetric edge states result in a strongly nonlinear
conductance-voltage characteristics, which could be used to manipulate the
tunneling transport.

another KS-class solution for dark energy, and a second black hole-like

  The black hole-like solutions feature segregated normal and tachyonic matter,
consistent with the assertion of previous work. In the first black hole-like

  The static phantom solution, a limit of an old one, is surprising at first,
since phantom energy is usually associated with super-exponential expansion.

luminous type IIn SN 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. In
photometry, a broad, bright (M_R~-21.7) peak characterizes all BVRI light
curves. Afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slow
luminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. At late phases (>237 days),
because of the large luminosity drop (>3 mag), only upper visibility limits are
obtained in the B, R and I bands. In the near-infrared, two K-band detections
on days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or IR echoes
scenarios. At all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broad
P-Cygni profiles and a multicomponent Halpha profile, which are the typical
signatures of type IIn SNe. After maximum, spectroscopic and photometric
similarities are found between SN 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated SNe
(e.g. SN 1997cy, SN 1999E and SN 2002ic). This suggests that ejecta-CSM
interaction plays a key role in SN 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,
sustaining the late-time-light curve. Alternatively, the late luminosity may be
related to the radioactive decay of ~3M_sun of 56Ni. Models of the light curve
in the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (R~6-8
10^(12)cm, M_ej~5-14M_sun), and that the SN ejecta collided with massive
(6-10M_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. These clumps do not
completely obscure the SN photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity is
due both to the decay of 56Ni and to interaction with CSM. A supermassive star
is not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarily
large explosion energy.

  A feature of this article is the role played by cocharacters $h_c$ attached

  The quotient varieties which occur in the Bernstein programme are replaced by
extended quotients. We form the disjoint union $A(G)$ of all these extended
quotient varieties. We conjecture that, after a simple algebraic deformation,
the space $A(G)$ is a model of the smooth dual $Irr(G)$. In this respect, our
programme is a conjectural refinement of the Bernstein programme.
  The algebraic deformation is controlled by cocharacters $h_c$, one for each
two-sided cell $c$ in certain extended affine Weyl groups. The cocharacters
themselves appear to be closely related to Langlands parameters.

building up on earlier theoretical studies where quantum interference effects

descriptions for the same molecule with different chemical connections to the

pyridil-anchors guarantee for the conductance to be determined by rather narrow
peaks situated closely to the Fermi energy which is relevant because it might
maximize the impact of quantum interferences on the I/V behaviour. In a scan of
eight different junction setups, where the connection sites of aromatic rings,
their torsion angle with respect to each other and the surface structure have
been varied, QIE was found to dominate the conductance for only one planar
geometry. For finite torsion angles between aromatic rings the effect moves to
higher energies and would therefore only be accessible for experimental
observation in a gated junction. ii) A detailed comparison between simple
topological models and DFT results for the investigated systems aims at
assessing the usefulness of such models as analysis tools for a better
understanding of the physics of QIE and its structure dependence.

Interestingly such rotating models can also better account for other features
as the variation with the metallicity of the C/O ratio. Damped Lyman Alpha
(DLA) systems present similar characteristics as the halo of the MW for what
concern the N/O and C/O ratios. Although in DLAs, the star formation history
might be quite different from that of the halo, in these systems also, rotating
stars (both massive and intermediate) probably play an important role for
explaining these features. The production of primary nitrogen is accompanied by
an overproduction of other elements as $^{13}$C, $^{22}$Ne and s-process
elements. We show also how the observed variation with the metallicity of the
number ratio of type Ibc to type II supernovae may be a consequence of the
metallicity dependence of the line-driven stellar winds.

particular we study the existence of slow or fast decaying solutions. For given
t>0, the fast solutions u(t,.) have a compact support in R^{N} when p>2, and
|x|^{p/(2-p)}u(t,x) is bounded at infinity when p<2. We describe the behaviour
for large |x| of all the solutions. According to the position of q with respect
to the first critical exponent p-1+p/N and the critical Sobolev exponent
q^{&#8727;}, we study the existence of positive solutions, or the number of the
zeros of u(t,.). We prove that any solution u(t,.) is oscillatory when p<2 and
q is closed to 1.

study the geometric structure of the operator $L_{B,A}$ and obtain new

missing mass as a signature as well as in fixed target experiments, where heavy
baryon decays contribute to sterile neutrino production, with sterile neutrino
decays as a signature. Generally, charmed baryons are found to be less
promising than charmed mesons, in contrast to b-hadrons. In the latter case,
branching ratios of beauty mesons and baryons into sterile neutrinos are of the
same order. As a consequence, at high energies beauty baryons give contribution
to sterile neutrino production comparable to the contribution of beauty mesons
(up to about 15%). Experimental limits on active-to-sterile mixing are quite
strong for neutrinos lighter than D-meson but for heavier neutrinos they are
weaker. As an example, for neutrino masses in the range 2 GeV $\lesssim

main unsolved, yet fundamental, problems in modern astrophysics. The
acceleration of particles relies on interactions between energetic particles
and magnetic turbulence. In the case of SNRs we can perform spatially resolved
studies in systems with known geometry, and the plasma physics deduced from
these observations will help us to understand other systems where rapid
particle acceleration is believed to occur and where observations as detailed
