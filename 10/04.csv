dynamics is ultrarelativistic gives rise to a harmonic power spectrum extending
to high orders and characterized by a relatively slow decay with the harmonic

theory predicts a universal value for p = 8/3 up to some cut-off m = m*. The
results presented in this work suggest that under conditions in which plasma

significantly weaker than that predicted by the similarity model.

set of terminals located at different vertices in the graph; our goal is to
produce a collection of cuts {E_1,...,E_k} such that E_i is a multiway cut for
commodity i and the maximum load on any edge is minimized. The load on an edge
is defined to be the number of cuts in the solution crossing the edge. In the
capacitated version of the problem the goal is to minimize the maximum relative
load on any edge--the ratio of the edge's load to its capacity. Multiway cut
packing arises in the context of graph labeling problems where we are given a
partial labeling of a set of items and a neighborhood structure over them, and,
informally, the goal is to complete the labeling in the most consistent way.
This problem was introduced by Rabani, Schulman, and Swamy (SODA'08), who
developed an O(log n/log log n) approximation for it in general graphs, as well
as an improved O(log^2 k) approximation in trees. Here n is the number of nodes
in the graph. We present the first constant factor approximation for this
problem in arbitrary undirected graphs. Our approach is based on the
observation that every instance of the problem admits a near-optimal laminar
solution (that is, one in which no pair of cuts cross each other).

the first observations of a Kolmogorov-like inertial range of Alfvenic
fluctuations in the magnetosheath flanks, below fci. In the vicinity of fci, a
spectral break is observed, like in solar wind turbulence. Above the break, the
energy of compressive and Alfvenic fluctuations generally follow a power law
with a spectral index between -3 and -2. Concerning the anisotropy of the wave
vector distribution, we observe a change in its nature in the vicinity of ion
characteristic scales: if at MHD scales there is no evidence for a dominance of
a slab (k||>kperp) or 2D (kperp>k||) turbulence, above the spectral break,
(f>fci, kc/wpi>1) the 2D turbulence dominates. This 2D turbulence is observed
in six selected one-hour intervals among which the average proton beta varies
from 0.8 to 9. It is observed for both the transverse and compressive magnetic
fluctuations, independently on the presence of linearly unstable modes at low
frequencies or Alfven vortices at the spectral break. We then analyse the
anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations in a time dependent reference frame
based on the field B and the flow velocity V directions. Within the range of
the 2D turbulence, at scales [1,30]kc/wpi, and for any beta we find that the
magnetic fluctuations at a given frequency in the plane perpendicular to B have
more energy along the BxV direction. This non-gyrotropy of the fluctuations is
consistent with gyrotropic fluctuations at a given wave vector, with kperp>k||,
which suffer a different Doppler shift along and perpendicular to V in the
plane perpendicular to B.

universal logarithmic corrections. In both two and three dimensions, we also
determine the location of the multicritical Nishimori point, as well as the

can then interact through quantum particle exchanges. Since individual
exchanges between the two fermions of a composite boson are ignored when
composite particles are replaced by elementary bosons, it is of importance to
reconsider the exchange energy argument for the stability of the Bose-Einstein
condensate in the case of composite bosons. We do this here in the light of the
new many-body theory which allows us to take exactly into account all possible
exchanges between the fermionic components of the composite bosons. We confirm
that the condensate of composite bosons is made of a unique state, this state
being moreover pure: a coherent superposition of states close in energy is

entanglement-assisted cheating in multi-prover interactive proof systems. It is
well-known that the standard oracularization technique completely fails in some
proof systems under the existence of prior entanglement. This paper studies two
constructions of two-prover one-round interactive proof systems based on
oracularization. First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive
proof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially
small soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest
provers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use
arbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time
hierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still
advantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use
quantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round
interactive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query
probabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even
against dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a
consequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive
proof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap

the prediction is rather insensitive to assumptions about observer formation in

at such a high redshift. Our mass reconstruction shows that on a large scale
the dark matter distribution is consistent with a relaxed system with no
significant substructures. However, on a small scale the cluster core is
resolved into two mass clumps highly correlated with the cluster galaxy
distribution. The dominant mass clump lies close to the brightest cluster
galaxy whereas the other less massive clump is located ~40"" (~310 kpc) to the
southwest. Although this secondary mass clump does not show an excess in the
X-ray surface brightness, the gas temperature of the region is much higher
(12~18 keV) than those of the rest. We propose a scenario in which the less
massive system has already passed through the main cluster and the X-ray gas
has been stripped during this passage. The elongation of the X-ray peak toward
the southwestern mass clump is also supportive of this possibility. We measure
significant tangential shears out to the field boundary (~1.5 Mpc), which are
well described by an Navarro-Frenk-White profile with a concentration parameter
of c200=2.7+-0.3 and a scale length of rs=78""+-19"" (~600 kpc) with

strongly enhanced. Our data indicate [Ba/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios of
<-2 dex and ~+0.8 dex, respectively, with essentially no detection of other
n-capture elements. In contrast to the only other dSph star with similar
abundance patterns, Dra 119, which has a very low metallicity at [Fe/H]=-2.95
dex, our objects, at [Fe/H]~-2.0 dex, are only moderately metal poor. The
measured ratio of hydrostatic/explosive alpha-elements indicates that high-mass
(~35 M_sun) Type II supernovae progenitors are the main, if not only,
contributors to the enrichment of this galaxy. This suggests that star
formation and chemical enrichment in the ultrafaint dSphs proceeds
stochastically and inhomogeneously on small scales, or that the IMF was
strongly skewed to high mass stars. The neutron capture deficiencies and the
[Co/Fe] and [Cr/Fe] abundance ratios in our stars are similar to those in the
extremely low metallicity Galactic halo. This suggests that either our stars
are composed mainly of the ejecta from the first, massive, population III stars

diluted with ~30 times less hydrogen than typical for extreme metal-poor stars.

elliptical galaxy M86 reveals a highly complex and disturbed ISM/ICM. The most
striking feature is a set of H$\alpha$ filaments which clearly connect M86 with
the nearby disturbed spiral NGC 4438 (23$'$=120 kpc projected away), providing
strong evidence for a previously unrecognized collision between them.
Spectroscopy of selected regions show a fairly smooth velocity gradient between
M86 and NGC 4438, consistent with the collision scenario. Such a collision
would impart significant energy into the ISM of M86, probably heating the gas
and acting to prevent the gas from cooling to form stars. We propose that cool
gas stripped from NGC 4438 during the collision and deposited in its wake is
heated by shocks, ram pressure drag, or thermal conduction, producing most of
the H$\alpha$ filaments. Some H$\alpha$ filaments are associated with the
well-known ridge of bright X-ray emission to the NW of the nucleus, suggesting
that the collision is responsible for peculiarities of M86 previously ascribed
to other effects. M86 is radio-quiet, thus AGN heating is unlikely to play a
significant role. The M86 system has implications for understanding the role of
gravitational interactions in the heating of the ISM in ellipticals, and how
collisions in clusters transform galaxies.

study of transverse momentum correlation in $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions. These
consist of {\it inclusive}, {\it event-wise} and a differential version of the
correlation measure $\tilde C$ introduced by Gavin \cite{Gavin} for
experimental study of the viscosity per unit entropy of the matter produced in
$A+A$ collisions. We study the quantitative difference between the three
observables on the basis of PYTHIA simulations of $p+p$ collisions and $A+A$
collisions consisting of an arbitrary superposition of $p+p$ collision events
at $\sqrt{s} = $200 GeV. We observe that {\it inclusive} and {\it event-wise}
correlation functions are remarkably identical to each other where as the
observable $\tilde C$ differs from the two. We study the robustness and
efficiency dependencies of these observables based on truncated Taylor
expansions in efficiency in $p+p$ collisions and on the basis of Monte Carlo
simulation using an adhoc detector efficiency parameterization. We find that
all the three observables are essentially independent of detector efficiency.
We additionally study the scaling of the correlation measures and find all the
observables exhibit an approximate $1/N$ dependence of the number of
participants ({\it N}) in $A+A$ collisions. Finally, we study the impact of
flow-like anisotropy on the {\it inclusive} correlation function and find flow
imparts azimuthal modulations similar to those observed with two-particle
densities.

large area (more than 10 times the area covered by the Chandra deep fields,
CDFs in the COSMOS field, to extend the search of highly obscured,
Compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. These sources have low
surface density and large samples can be provided only through large area
surveys, like the COSMOS survey. We analyze the X-ray properties of COSMOS MIPS
sources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$Jy. For the MIPS sources not
directly detected in the Chandra images we produce stacked images in soft and
hard X-rays bands. To estimate the fraction of Compton-thick AGN in the MIPS
source population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardness
ratios to those predicted by detailed Monte Carlo simulations including both
obscured AGN and star-forming galaxies. The density of lower luminosity
Compton-thick AGN (logL(2-10keV)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)
\times10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of X-ray selected
AGN. The comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, Compton thick
AGN to the X-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured AGN at high and
low luminosity suggests that Compton-thick AGN follow a luminosity dependence
similar to that discovered for Compton-thin AGN, becoming relatively rarer at
high luminosities. We estimate that the fraction of AGN (unobscured, moderately
obscured and Compton thick) to the total MIPS source population is $49\pm10%$,
a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$m

identification of model parameters and their spatially variability from noisy
measurements of the response or output. Such parameters are frequently
encountered in PDE-based models and correspond to quantities such as density or
pressure fields, elasto-plastic moduli and internal variables in solid
mechanics, conductivity fields in heat diffusion problems, permeability fields
in fluid flow through porous media etc. The proposed model has all the
advantages of traditional Bayesian formulations such as the ability to produce
measures of confidence for the inferences made and providing not only
predictive estimates but also quantitative measures of the predictive
uncertainty. In contrast to existing approaches it utilizes a parsimonious,
non-parametric formulation that favors sparse representations and whose
complexity can be determined from the data. The proposed framework in
non-intrusive and makes use of a sequence of forward solvers operating at
various resolutions. As a result, inexpensive, coarse solvers are used to
identify the most salient features of the unknown field(s) which are
subsequently enriched by invoking solvers operating at finer resolutions. This
leads to significant computational savings particularly in problems involving
computationally demanding forward models but also improvements in accuracy. It
is based on a novel, adaptive scheme based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling
which is embarrassingly parallelizable and circumvents issues with slow mixing
encountered in Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.

relay channels. For this class of relay channels, the relay observes an i.i.d.
sequence $T$, which is independent of the channel input $X$. The channel is
described by a set of probability transition functions $p(y|x,t)$ for all
$(x,t,y)\in \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{T}\times \mathcal{Y}$. Furthermore, a
noiseless link of finite capacity $R_{0}$ exists from the relay to the
receiver. Although the capacity for these channels is not known in general, the
capacity of a subclass of these channels, namely when $T=g(X,Y)$, for some
deterministic function $g$, was obtained in [1] and it was shown to be equal to
the cut-set bound. Another instance where the capacity was obtained was in [2],
where the channel output $Y$ can be written as $Y=X\oplus Z$, where $\oplus$
denotes modulo-$m$ addition, $Z$ is independent of $X$,
$|\mathcal{X}|=|\mathcal{Y}|=m$, and $T$ is some stochastic function of $Z$.
The compress-and-forward (CAF) achievability scheme [3] was shown to be
capacity achieving in both cases.
  Using our upper bound we recover the capacity results of [1] and [2]. We also
obtain the capacity of a class of channels which does not fall into either of
the classes studied in [1] and [2]. For this class of channels, CAF scheme is
shown to be optimal but capacity is strictly less than the cut-set bound for
certain values of $R_{0}$. We also evaluate our outer bound for a particular
relay channel with binary multiplicative states and binary additive noise for
which the channel is given as $Y=TX+N$. We show that our upper bound is
strictly better than the cut-set upper bound for certain values of $R_{0}$ but
it lies strictly above the rates yielded by the CAF achievability scheme.

Still, one can start from a set of axioms that describe the most desirable

analogy to the Khinchin axioms in information theory, which fix the most
desirable properties an information measure should have and that ultimately
lead to the Shannon entropy as the fundamental information measure on which
statistical mechanics is based. Here we formulate a set of axioms for the

replacing the dependency of the information measure on probabilities of events

nature. Evaluating this set of axioms one finally arrives at a formula for the
cosmological constant that is given by Lambda = (G^2/hbar^4) (m_e/alpha_el)^6,
where G is the gravitational constant, m_e is the electron mass, and alpha_el
is the low energy limit of the fine structure constant. This formula is in
perfect agreement with current WMAP data. Our approach gives physical meaning

value of the cosmological constant is not at all unnatural.

targets of pointer variables and is usually considered part of the more general
aliasing problem, which consists in establishing whether and when different

essential to every tool that needs to reason about the semantics of programs.
However, due to well-known undecidability results, for all interesting
languages that admit aliasing, the exact solution of nontrivial aliasing
problems is not generally computable. This work focuses on approximated
solutions to this problem by presenting a store-based, flow-sensitive points-to
analysis, for applications in the field of automated software verification. In
contrast to software testing procedures, which heuristically check the program
against a finite set of executions, the methods considered in this work are
static analyses, where the computed results are valid for all the possible
executions of the analyzed program. We present a simplified programming
language and its execution model; then an approximated execution model is
developed using the ideas of abstract interpretation theory. Finally, the
soundness of the approximation is formally proved. The aim of developing a
realistic points-to analysis is pursued by presenting some extensions to the
initial simplified model and discussing the correctness of their formulation.
This work contains original contributions to the issue of points-to analysis,
as it provides a formulation of a filter operation on the points-to abstract
domain and a formal proof of the soundness of the defined abstract operations:
these, as far as we now, are lacking from the previous literature.

important consequences in many fields and might cause multivariate clustering
patterns such as segregation or association. The spatial pattern of segregation
occurs when members of a class tend to be found near members of the same class
(i.e., conspecifics), while association occurs when members of a class tend to
be found near members of the other class or classes. These patterns can be
tested using a nearest neighbor contingency table (NNCT). The null hypothesis
is randomness in the nearest neighbor (NN) structure, which may result from --
among other patterns -- random labeling (RL) or complete spatial randomness
(CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called the CSR independence,
henceforth). In this article, we consider Dixon's class-specific tests of
segregation and introduce a new class-specific test, which is a new
decomposition of Dixon's overall chi-square segregation statistic. We
demonstrate that the tests we consider provide information on different aspects
of the spatial interaction between the classes and they are conditional under
the CSR independence pattern, but not under the RL pattern. We analyze the
distributional properties and prove the consistency of these tests; compare the
empirical significant levels (Type I error rates) and empirical power estimates
of the tests using Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the new
class-specific tests also have comparable performance with the currently
available tests based on NNCTs in terms of Type I error and power estimates.
For illustrative purposes, we use three example data sets. We also provide

spreading factor. Also we propose an ML decoder for a subclass of these codes
that is computationally implementable. Although for our simulations we consider
a scenario that is worse than what occurs in practice, simulation results
indicate that this coding/decoding scheme is robust against additive noise. As
an example, for 64 chips and 88 users we propose a coding/decoding scheme that
can obtain an arbitrary small probability of error which is computationally
feasible and can detect active users. Furthermore, we prove that for this to be
possible the number of users cannot be beyond 230.

  ML Decoder",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we wish to introduce a method to reconstruct large size Welch
Bound Equality (WBE) codes from small size WBE codes. The advantage of these
codes is that the implementation of ML decoder for the large size codes is
reduced to implementation of ML decoder for the core codes. This leads to a
drastic reduction of the computational cost of ML decoder. Our method can also
be used for constructing large Binary WBE (BWBE) codes from smaller ones.
Additionally, we explain that although WBE codes are maximizing the sum channel
capacity when the inputs are real valued, they are not necessarily appropriate
when the input alphabet is binary. The discussion shows that when the input
alphabet is binary, the Total Squared Correlation (TSC) of codes is not a
proper figure of merit.

are derived. The quadratic Poisson tensors is given by the use of the recursion
operators of the Lax hierarchies. The theory is illustrated by
$\Delta$-differential counterparts of Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur and Kaup-Broer
hierarchies.

  permanent electric dipole moment of Rubidium atom","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum mechanics thinks that all atoms do not have permanent electric dipole
moment (EDM) because of their spherical symmetry. Therefore, there is no polar
atom in nature except for polar molecules. The electric susceptibility Xe
caused by the orientation of polar substances is inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature T while the induced susceptibility of atoms is temperature
independent. Using special capacitors our experiments discovered that
directional motion of Rb atoms in a non-uniform electric field and ground state
Rb atom is polar atom with a large EDM: d(Rb) =2.72*10-29C.m = 1.70*10-8e.cm.
The experiment showed that the relationship between Xe of Rb vapor and T is
just Xe =B/T, where the slope B =380(k) as polar molecules. Its capacitance C
at different voltage V was measured. The C-V curve shows that the saturation
polarization of Rb vapor has be observed when E more than 8.5*104V/m. New
example of CP (charge conjugation and parity) violation occurred in Rb atoms
(see arXiv 0809.4767). If Rb atom has a large EDM, why the linear Stark effect
has not been observed? The article discussed the question thoroughly. Our
results are easy to be repeated because the details of the experiment are
described in the article.
