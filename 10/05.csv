  Quantum Gravity","110 pages, 30 figures, PhD thesis",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we analyze a very simple model of two dimensional quantum
gravity based on causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). We present an exactly
solvable model which indicates that it is possible to incorporate spatial
topology changes in the nonperturbative path integral. It is shown that if the
change in spatial topology is accompanied by a coupling constant it is possible
to evaluate the path integral to all orders in the coupling and that the result
can be viewed as a hybrid between causal and Euclidian dynamical triangulation.
The second model we describe shows how a classical geometry with constant
negative curvature emerges naturally from a path integral over noncompact
manifolds. No initial singularity is present, hence the quantum geometry is
naturally compatible with the Hartle Hawking boundary condition. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that under certain conditions the quantum fluctuations are
small! To conclude, we treat the problem of spacetime topology change. Although
we are not able to completely solve the path integral over all manifolds with
arbitrary topology, we do obtain results that indicate that such a path
integral might be consistent, provided suitable causality restrictions are
imposed.

gravity, magnetic fields, ambipolar diffusion, and nonlinear flows. The
thin-sheet approximation is employed with periodic lateral boundary conditions,
and the nonlinear flow field (""turbulence"") is allowed to freely decay. In
agreement with previous results in the literature, our results show that the
onset of runaway collapse (formation of the first star) in subcritical clouds
is significantly accelerated by nonlinear flows in which a large-scale wave
mode dominates the power spectrum. In addition, we find that a power spectrum
with equal energy on all scales also accelerates collapse, but by a lesser
amount. For a highly super-Alfvenic initial velocity field with most power on
the largest scales, the collapse occurs promptly during the initial compression
wave. However, for trans-Alfvenic perturbations, a subcritical magnetic field
causes a rebound from the initial compression, and the system undergoes several
oscillations before runaway collapse occurs. Models that undergo prompt
collapse have highly supersonic infall motions at the core boundaries. Cores in
magnetically subcritical models with trans-Alfvenic initial perturbations also
pick up significant systematic speeds by inheriting motions associated with
magnetically-driven oscillations. Core mass distributions are much broader than
in models with small-amplitude initial perturbations, although the disturbed
structure of cores that form due to nonlinear flows does not guarantee
subsequent monolithic collapse. Our simulations also demonstrate that
significant power can (if present initially) be maintained with negligible
dissipation in large-scale compressive modes of a magnetic thin sheet, in the
limit of perfect flux freezing.

we investigate semiclassical approximations of the propagators. The basic
method is to start from a semiclassical Fourier integral operator ansatz and
then construct approximate solutions of the corresponding evolution equations.
In doing so, we give a complete description of the Hamilton flow, which in most
cases is given by elliptic functions. We find that the semiclassical
approximation behaves well when acting on sufficiently localized initial
conditions, for example, finite sums of semiclassical Hermite-Gaussian modes,
since near the origin the Hamilton trajectories trace out the bounded

by comparing various cluster parameters of the HIFLUGCS sample to the
integrated radio luminosity of the central AGN, L_R, defined as the total
synchrotron power between 10 MHz and 15 GHz. We adopt the central cooling time,
t_cool, as the diagnostic to ascertain cooling properties of the clusters and
classify clusters with t_cool < 1 Gyr as strong cooling core (SCC) clusters,
with 1 Gyr < t_cool <7.7 Gyr as weak cooling core (WCC) clusters and with
t_cool > 7.7 Gyr as non-cooling core (NCC) clusters. We find 48 out of 64
clusters (75%) contain cluster center radio sources (CCRS) cospatial with or
within 50 h^{-1}_{71} kpc of the X-ray peak emission. Further, we find that the
probability of finding a CCRS increases from 45% to 67% to 100% for NCC, WCC
and SCC clusters, respectively, suggesting an AGN-feedback machinery in SCC
clusters which regulates the cooling in the central regions.
  We find L_R in SCC clusters depends strongly on the cluster scale such that
more massive clusters harbor more powerful radio AGN. The same trend is
observed between L_R and the classical mass deposition rate, MDR, albeit much
stronger, in SCC and partly also in WCC clusters. We also perform correlations
of the 2MASS K-band luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy, L_BCG, with L_R
and cluster parameters. We invoke the relation between L_BCG and the black hole
mass, M_BH, and find a surprisingly tight correlation between M_BH and L_R for
SCC clusters. We find also an excellent correlation of L_BCG with M500 and L_X
for the entire sample; however, SCC clusters show a tighter trend in both the
cases. We discuss the plausible reasons behind these scaling relations in the
context of cooling flows and AGN feedback. [Abridged]

the remnant center. There appears to be faint, diffuse [Fe II] emission between
the central clump and the western filamentary emission. The spectroscopic
observations determine the expansion velocity of the central clump to be ~56
km/s. This is far smaller than the expansion velocity of 3C 396 obtained from
X-ray observations, implying the inhomogeneity of the ambient medium. The
electron number density of the [Fe II] emission gas is < 2,000 cm-3. The H2
line emission, on the other hand, lies slightly outside the filamentary [Fe II]
emission in the western boundary, and forms a rather straight filament. We
suggest that the [Fe II] emission represents dense clumps in the wind material
from the red supergiant phase of a Type IIL/b progenitor of 3C 396 which have
been swept up by the supernova remnant shocks. The H2 emission may represent
either the boundary of a wind bubble produced during the main-sequence phase of
the progenitor or molecular clumps left over inside the bubble. We propose that
the near-infrared [Fe II] and H2 emission observed in several supernova

still controversial, especially on the velocity-related part in the virial
stress definition. In this paper, by strictly following the classical
definition of the Cauchy stress for continuum medium, the fundamental
Lagrangian atomic stress is proposed and can be used to obtain the correct
Cauchy stress under any circumstances. Furthermore, the Lagrangian virial
stress is proposed, which is still in virial form but does not include
velocities to avoid controversial velocity treatments. It is also found that
the widely used classical virial stress is actually the Eulerian virial stress,
which includes the velocities of atoms, and is valid only when the
impulse-momentum theorem is applicable to estimate the internal forces. However
this requirement for the Eulerian atomic stress can not always be met in
practical cases, such as the material volume element in rotation and the
examples presented in this paper, but the proposed Lagrangian atomic stress can
avoid these velocity-related nonobjectivities.

Applications of these methods are not limited to the dynamical systems that we
consider here. We choose to show their effectiveness and to describe the theory
for two large families of maps. The first chapter deals with holomorphic
endomorphisms of the projective space P^k. We establish the first properties
and give several constructions for the Green currents and the equilibrium
measure \mu. The emphasis is on quantitative properties and speed of
convergence. We then treat equidistribution problems and establish ergodic
properties of \mu: K-mixing, exponential decay of correlations for various
classes of observables, central limit theorem and large deviations theorem.
Finally, we study the entropy, the Lyapounov exponents and the dimension of
\mu. The second chapter develops the theory of polynomial-like maps in higher
dimension. We introduce the dynamical degrees and construct the equilibrium
measure \mu of maximal entropy. Then, under a natural assumption, we prove
equidistribution properties of points and various statistical properties of the
measure \mu. The assumption is stable under small pertubations on the map. We
also study the dimension of \mu, the Lyapounov exponents and their variation.
Our aim is to get a self-contained text that requires only a minimal
background. In order to help the reader, an appendix gives the basics on p.s.h.
functions, positive closed currents and super-potentials on projective spaces.

quantum dots is experimentally investigated. The dots exhibit a strong Coulomb
repulsion between the two excitons, which results in a huge measured biexciton
blue shift of up to 300 meV. Such a strong Coulomb repulsion implies a very
narrow hole wave function localized around the defect, which is manifested by a
large Stokes shift. Moreover, we show that the biexciton blue shift increases
linearly with the Stokes shift. This result is highly relevant for the use of
colloidal QDs as optical gain media, where a large biexciton blue shift is
required to obtain gain in the single exciton regime.

theory of how to construct two asymptotically sinusoidal solutions of the wave
equation with a phase shift using the same basis having the same boundary
conditions at the origin. Analytic series representations of these solutions
are obtained. In 1D, one of the solutions is an even function that behaves
asymptotically as sin(x), whereas the other is an odd function, which is
asymptotically cos(x). The latter vanishes at the origin whereas the derivative
of the former becomes zero there. Eliminating the lowest N terms of the series
makes these functions vanishingly small in an interval around the origin whose

confirm the youth and determine the spectral types among a sample of young

infrared excess objects, previously discovered by the Spitzer Legacy Program
""From Molecular Cores to Planet-Forming Disks"" (c2d), bright enough for
subsequent Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy. We obtained 78 optical spectra of
sufficient S/N for analysis. Extinctions, effective temperatures and
luminosities are estimated for this sample, and used to construct H-R diagrams
for the population. We identified 20 background giants contaminating the
sample, based on their relatively high extinction, position in the H-R diagram,
the lack of Halpha emission and relatively low infrared excess. Such strong
background contamination (25%) is consistent with the location of Serpens being
close to the Galactic plane (5degrees Galactic latitude). The remaining 58
stars (75%) were all confirmed to be young, mostly K and M-type stars that are
presumed to belong to the cloud. Individual ages and masses for the YSOs are
inferred based on theoretical evolutionary models. The models indicate a spread
in stellar ages from 1 to 15 Myr, peaking at 2 - 6 Myr, and a mass distribution
of 0.2 to 1.2 Msun with median value around 0.8 Msun. Strong H emission lines
(EW[Halpha] > 3 A) have been detected in more than half of the sample (35
stars). The mass accretion rates as derived from the H line widths span a broad
distribution over 4 orders of magnitude with median accretion rate of 10^-8
Msun/yr. Our analysis shows that the majority of the infrared excess objects
detected in Serpens are actively accreting, young T-Tauri stars.

M82 resembles that of Galactic Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs). In particular,
large abundances of the reactive ions HOC+ and CO+ have been measured in the
nucleus of this galaxy. To investigate the origin of the large abundances of
reactive ions in M82, we have completed our previous 30m HOC+ J=1-0
observations with the higher excitation HCO+ and HOC+ J=4-3 and 3-2 rotational
lines. In addition, we have obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer (PdBI) a 4"" resolution map of the HOC+ 1-0 emission, the first
ever obtained in a Galactic or extragalactic source. Our HOC+ interferometric
image shows that the emission of the HOC+ 1-0 line is mainly restricted to the
nuclear disk, with the maxima towards the E. and W. molecular peaks. In
addition, line excitation calculations imply that the HOC+ emission arises in
dense gas. Therefore, the HOC+ emission is arising in the dense PDRs embedded
in the M82 nuclear disk, rather than in the intercloud phase and/or wind. We
have improved our previous chemical model of M82 by (i) using the new version
of the Meudon PDR code, (ii) updating the chemical network, and (iii)
considering two different types of clouds (with different thickness). Most
molecular observations (HCO+, HOC+, CO+, CN, HCN, H3O+) are well explained
assuming that ~ 87 % of the mass of the molecular gas is forming small clouds
(Av=5 mag) while only ~ 13 % of the mass is in large molecular clouds (Av=50
mag). Such small number of large molecular clouds suggests that M82 is an old
starburst, where star formation has almost exhausted the molecular gas
reservoir.
