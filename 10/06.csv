about 3-sigma deviation from the SM prediction, which would signal the presence
of new physics in association with the Zbb coupling. In this work we give a
comprehensive study for the full one-loop supersymmetric effects on the Zbb
coupling in both the MSSM and the NMSSM by considering all current constraints
which are from the precision electroweak measurements, the direct search for
sparticles and Higgs bosons, the stability of Higgs potential, the dark matter
relic density, and the muon g-2 measurement. We analyze the characters of each
type of the corrections and search for the SUSY parameter regions where the
corrections could be sizable. We find that the sizable corrections may come
from the Higgs sector with light m_A and large tan-beta, which can reach -2%
and -6% for rho_b and sin^2 \theta_{eff}^b,respectively. However, such sizable
negative corrections are just opposite to what needed to solve the anomaly. We
also scan over the allowed parameter space and investigate to what extent
supersymmetry can narrow the discrepancy. We find that under all current
constraints, the supersymmetric effects are quite restrained and cannot
significantly ameliorate the anomaly of Zbb coupling. Compared with \chi^2/dof
= 9.62/2 in the SM, the MSSM and NMSSM can only improve it to \chi^2/dof =
8.77/2 in the allowed parameter space. Therefore, if the anomaly of Zbb
coupling is not a statistical or systematic problem, it would suggest new
physics beyond the MSSM or NMSSM.

Probe) observations are helpful on the road to this goal, and the forthcoming
experiments (Planck) are likely to complete this mission. We show that the
5-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe $TE$ data contains a hint of the
presence of gravitational wave contribution. In terms of the parameter $R$,
which gives the ratio of contributions from gravitational waves and density
perturbations to the temperature quadrupole, the best-fit model produced
$R=0.24$. Because of large residual noises, the uncertainty of this
determination is still large, and it easily includes the R=0 hypothesis.
However, the uncertainty will be strongly reduced in the forthcoming
observations which are more sensitive. We numerically simulated the Planck data
and concluded that the relic gravitational waves with $R=0.24$ will be present
at a better than 3$\sigma$ level in the $TE$ observational channel, and at a
better than 2$\sigma$ level in the `realistic' $BB$ channel. The balloon-borne

Telescope are used to probe the stellar content outside of the central
star-forming regions of M82. Stars evolving on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) are traced along the major axis out to projected distances of 12 kpc,
which corresponds to 13 disk scale lengths. The specific frequency (SF) of
bright AGB stars in the outer disks of M82 and the Sc galaxy NGC 2403 are
identical, suggesting that the specific star formation rates (SFR) in these
galaxies during intermediate epochs were similar. This similarity in stellar
content, coupled with the presence of an extended stellar disk, is consistent
with M82 having been a late-type disk galaxy prior to interacting with M81.
Still, there is a paucity of red supergiants (RSGs) in the outer disk of M82
when compared with NGC 2403, indicating that the SFR in the outer regions of
M82 during the past ~ 0.1 Gyr has declined dramatically with respect to that in
isolated late-type galaxies. A mixture of bright main sequence stars, RSGs, and
AGB stars are detected out to minor axis distances of 7 kpc along the outflow.
It is suggested that the young and intermediate aged stars in the extraplanar
regions formed in structures similar to M82 South, and that these were
subsequently disrupted by the tidal action of M82.

independence number $\alpha$ of a graph is at least the number of vertices $n$

inequality, replacing the independence number $\alpha$ by $2\alpha-1$, that is,
$$(2\alpha-1)\cdot h \geq n.$$ In 2005 Kawarabayashi, Plummer and the second
author published an improvement of the theorem, replacing $2\alpha - 1$ by
$2\alpha - 3/2$ when $\alpha$ is at least 3. Since then a further improvement
by Kawarabayashi and Song has been obtained, replacing $2\alpha - 1$ by
$2\alpha - 2$ when $\alpha$ is at least 3.
  In this paper a basic elementary extension of the Theorem of Duchet and
Meyniel is presented. This may be of help to avoid dealing with basic cases
when looking for more substantial improvements. The main unsolved problem (due
to Seymour) is to improve, even just slightly, the theorem of Duchet and
Meyniel in the case when the independence number $\alpha$ is equal to 2. The
case $\alpha = 2$ of Hadwiger's Conjecture was first pointed out by Mader as an
interesting special case.

images obtained with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Three new
concentrations of bright main sequence stars and red supergiants are identified
within ~ 20 kpc of M81. These systems have integrated brightnesses M_V ~ -11
and surface brightnesses ~ 27 - 28 mag per arcsec^2 in V. The main sequence
turn-offs are consistent with an age of ~ 30 Myr, while the presence of a
well-developed red supergiant plume indicates that their stellar content is not
coeval, as they also formed stars ~ 100 Myr in the past. The photometric
properties of the red supergiants indicate that the young stars in these
systems have metallicities that are comparable to those of other objects in the
debris field. The HI density near these groupings comfortably exceeds the
threshold required to trigger star formation. Based on the close proximity of
these objects to M81, coupled with their extended sizes and low inferred

probably dissipate within the next ~ 1 Gyr.

implementation of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) and optical media, under the action of a potential with two
symmetric minima. In the limit case when the NDWP structure is induced by the
local nonlinearity coefficient represented by a set of two delta-functions, a
fully analytical solution is obtained for symmetric, antisymmetric and
asymmetric states. In this solvable model, the SSB bifurcation has a fully
subcritical character. Numerical analysis, based on both direct simulations and
computation of stability eigenvalues, demonstrates that, while the symmetric
states are stable up to the SSB bifurcation point, both symmetric and emerging
asymmetric states, as well as all antisymmetric ones, are unstable in the model
with the delta-functions. In the general model with a finite width of the
nonlinear-potential wells, the asymmetric states quickly become stable,
simultaneously with the switch of the SSB bifurcation from the subcritical to
supercritical type. Antisymmetric solutions may also get stabilized in the NDWP
structure of the general type, which gives rise to a bistability between them
and asymmetric states. The symmetric states require a finite norm for their
existence, an explanation to which is given. A full diagram for the existence
and stability of the trapped states in the model is produced. Experimental
observation of the predicted effects should be possible in BEC formed by

interaction of binary stars with the supermassive black hole in the Galactic
centre (GC), which accelerates one component of the binary to beyond the
Galactic escape velocity. Aims: The evolutionary status and GC origin of the
HVS SDSS J113312.12+010824.9 (HVS7) is constrained from a detailed study of its
stellar parameters and chemical composition. Methods: High-resolution spectra
of HVS7 obtained with UVES on the ESO VLT were analysed using state-of-the-art
NLTE/LTE modelling techniques that can account for a chemically-peculiar
composition via opacity sampling. Results: Instead of the expected slight
enrichments of alpha-elements and near-solar Fe, huge chemical peculiarities of
all elements are apparent. The He abundance is very low (<1/100 solar), C, N
and O are below the detection limit, i.e they are underabundant (<1/100, <1/3
and <1/10 solar). Heavier elements, however, are overabundant: the iron group
by a factor of ~10, P, Co and Cl by factors ~40, 80 and 440 and rare-earth
elements and Hg even by ~10000. An additional finding, relevant also for other
chemically peculiar stars are the large NLTE effects on abundances of TiII and
FeII (~0.6-0.7dex). The derived abundance pattern of HVS7 is characteristic for
the class of chemical peculiar magnetic B stars on the main sequence. The
chemical composition and high vsini=55+-2km/s render a low mass nature of HVS7
as a blue horizontal branch star unlikely. Conclusions: Such a surface
abundance pattern is caused by atomic diffusion in a possibly magnetically
stabilised, non-convective atmosphere. Hence all chemical information on the
star's place of birth and its evolution has been washed out. High precision
astrometry is the only means to validate a GC origin for HVS7.

the complex rate functions in these problems are closely related to ratios of

Optimization (MCO) and Parametric Learning (PL), a type of machine learning. A
well-known overarching principle used to improve the performance of many PL
algorithms is the bias-variance tradeoff. This tradeoff has been used to
improve PL algorithms ranging from Monte Carlo estimation of integrals, to
linear estimation, to general statistical estimation. Moreover, as described
by, MCO is very closely related to PL. Owing to this similarity, the
bias-variance tradeoff affects MCO performance, just as it does PL performance.
  In this article, we exploit the bias-variance tradeoff to enhance the
performance of MCO algorithms. We use the technique of cross-validation, a
technique based on the bias-variance tradeoff, to significantly improve the
performance of the Cross Entropy (CE) method, which is an MCO algorithm. In
previous work we have confirmed that other PL techniques improve the perfomance
of other MCO algorithms. We conclude that the many techniques pioneered in PL
could be investigated as ways to improve MCO algorithms in general, and the CE
method in particular.

error probability in the high-SNR regime in terms of the Diversity-Multiplexing
Tradeoff (DMT). Following this, we characterize the error probability for fixed
SNR in the regime of large (but finite) number of antennas.
  As far as the DMT is concerned, we report a negative result: we show that
both linear Zero-Forcing (ZF) and linear Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE)
receivers achieve the same DMT, which is largely suboptimal even in the case
where outer coding and decoding is performed across the antennas. We also
provide an approximate quantitative analysis of the markedly different behavior
of the MMSE and ZF receivers at finite rate and non-asymptotic SNR, and show
that while the ZF receiver achieves poor diversity at any finite rate, the MMSE
receiver error curve slope flattens out progressively, as the coding rate
increases.
  When SNR is fixed and the number of antennas becomes large, we show that the
mutual information at the output of a MMSE or ZF linear receiver has
fluctuations that converge in distribution to a Gaussian random variable, whose
mean and variance can be characterized in closed form. This analysis extends to
the linear receiver case a well-known result previously obtained for the
optimal receiver. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic analysis captures
accurately the outage behavior of systems even with a moderate number of

demonstrate that current simulations of line driven AGN accretion disk winds

heating of conducting filaments inside the films. By carefully controlling the
applied dc bias, we obtained several low resistance states, whose values of the
third harmonic coefficient B3f were proportional to R2+w (with w = 2.07). This
suggested that the resistance changes of the NiO films were accompanied by
connectivity changes of the conducting filaments, as observed in classical
percolating systems.

derived.

we demonstrated that all well-known important thermodynamical characteristics
of the black hole (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein entropy/surface
quantization and Hawking temperature) can be effectively reproduced starting by
simple supposition that black hole horizon circumference holds integer number
of reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass (energy) spectrum of a
small quantum system. (Obviously it is conceptually analogous to Bohr
quantization postulate interpreted by de Broglie relation in Old,
Bohr-Sommerfeld, quantum theory.) Especially, black hole entropy can be
presented as the quotient of the black hole mass and the minimal mass of small
quantum system in ground mass (energy) state. Now, we suppose that black hole
mass correction is simply equivalent to negative classical potential energy of
the gravitational interaction between black hole and small quantum system in
ground mass (energy) state. As it is not hard to see absolute value of the
classical potential energy of gravitational interaction is identical to black
hole temperature. All this, according to first thermodynamical law, implies
that first order entropy correction holds form of the logarithm of the surface
with coefficient -0.5. Our result, obtained practically quasi-classically,
""without knowing the details of quantum gravity"", is equivalent to result
obtained by loop quantum gravity and other quantum gravity methods for
macroscopic black holes.

The low flux spectrum presents a strong Fe Kalpha line associated to a Compton
reflection continuum. An additional spectral line around 6.6 keV is required to
fit Kalpha emission from Fe XXV. The spectral curvature below 6 keV implies
obscuration by neutral gas with a column density of 8*10^{23}cm^{-2} partially
covering the primary emission, which still contributes for a few percent of the
soft X-ray emission. Absorption by ionised material on the line of sight is
required to fit the deep trough below 1 keV. The comparison of the two spectral

photometric measurements of thousands of stars that have been continuously
observed for months.
  Aims. The discovery and characterization of the first very massive transiting
planetary companion with a short orbital period is reported.
  Methods. A series of 34 transits was detected in the CoRoT light curve of an
F3V star, observed from May to October 2007 for 152 days. The radius was
accurately determined and the mass derived for this new transiting, thanks to
the combined analysis of the light curve and complementary ground-based
observations: high-precision radial-velocity measurements, on-off photometry,
and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations.
  Results. CoRoT-Exo-3b has a radius of 1.01+-0.07 RJup and transits around its
F3-type primary every 4.26 days in a synchronous orbit. Its mass of 21.66+-1.0
MJup, density of 26.4+-5.6 g cm^-3, and surface gravity of log g = 4.72 clearly
distinguish it from the regular close-in planet population, making it the most
intriguing transiting substellar object discovered so far.
  Conclusions. With the current data, the nature of CoRoT-Exo-3b is ambiguous,
as it could either be a low-mass brown-dwarf or a member of a new class of
""superplanets"". Its discovery may help constrain the evolution of close-in
planets and brown-dwarfs better. Finally, CoRoT-Exo-3b confirms the trend that
massive transiting giant planets (M >= 4 MJup) are found preferentially around
more massive stars than the Sun.

transport and spectral properties of such structures are strongly anisotropic.
In the direction perpendicular to the layers, the eigenstates in a disordered
sample are delocalized for all energies and provide a minimal non-zero
conductivity, which cannot be destroyed by disorder, no matter how strong this
is. However, along with extended states, there exist discrete sets of angles
and energies with exponentially localized eigenfunctions (disorder-induced
resonances). It is shown that, depending on the type of the unperturbed system,
the disorder could either suppress or enhance the transmission. Most remarkable
properties of the transmission have been found in graphene systems built of
alternating p-n and n-p junctions. This transmission has anomalously narrow
angular spectrum and, surprisingly, in some range of directions it is
practically independent of the amplitude of fluctuations of the potential.
Owing to these features, such samples could be used as building blocks in
tunable electronic circuits. To better understand the physical implications of
the results presented here, most of our results have been contrasted with those

into the following three categories: (i) the wings have flatter spectral
indices than the active lobes, (ii) the wings and the active lobes have
comparable spectral indices, and (iii) the wings have steeper spectral indices
than the active lobes. In addition, based on our preliminary analysis, one
sample source from our comparison sample shows a spectral index result
belonging to category (i). Future. Milliarcsecond scale imaging will be
conducted on some of these X-shaped sources to investigate if they are examples
of binary AGN systems and thereby understand the nature of these sources.

earlier studies of samples of `X-shaped' radio sources, which have similar
luminosities and small-scale radio structures to our targets but exhibit
large-scale extensions to their lobes that more typical FRII sources lack;
earlier spectral work with the GMRT has suggested that these `wings' sometimes
have flat spectral indices at low frequencies, in contrast to expectations from
models in which the wings are formed hydrodynamically or by jet reorientation.
In our new observations we find that almost all of our target FRII radio
galaxies show standard spectral steepening as a function of distance from the
hotspot at the low frequencies (610 MHz and 240 MHz) provided by the GMRT data,
even when transverse extensions to the lobes are present. However, one source,
3C321, has a low-surface-brightness extension to one lobe that shows a flatter

on large lattices, because the statistical fluctuations of quark determinants

can be understood to follow from the properties of individual avalanches, while
longer time correlations often present in such signals reflect correlations
between triggerings of different avalanches. As one possible source of the
latter kind of correlations in experimental time series, we consider the effect
of a finite detection threshold, due to e.g. experimental noise that needs to
be removed. To this end, we study a simple toy model of an avalanche, a random
walk returning to the origin or a Brownian bridge, in the presence and absence
of superimposed delta-correlated noise. We discuss the properties after
thresholding of artificial timeseries obtained by mixing toy avalanches and
waiting times from a Poisson process. Most of the resulting scalings for
individual avalanches and the composite timeseries can be understood via random

noise is added. Then, to compare with a more complicated case we study the

which enables one to explain quark confinement based on the dual
superconductivity picture in a gauge independent way. This is because we can
define gauge-invariant magnetic monopoles which are inherent in the Wilson loop
operator. For SU(3) there are two options: the minimal option with a single
type of non-Abelian magnetic monopole characterized by the maximal stability
subgroup $\tilde{H}=U(2)=SU(2)\times U(1)$, and the maximal one with two types
of Abelian magnetic monopoles characterized by the maximal torus subgroup
$\tilde{H}=U(1)\times U(1)$. The maximal option corresponds to a gauge
independent reformulation of the Abelian projection represented by the
conventional MAG. In the minimal option, we have successfully performed the
numerical simulation of the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on a lattice. We give
preliminary numerical results showing the dominance of the non-Abelian magnetic
monopole in the string tension obtained from the Wilson loop in the fundamental
representation, and the infrared dominance of a decomposed field variable for
correlation functions after demonstrating the preservation of color symmetry
which was explicitly broken by the conventional MAG.

dominated by shadow hiding (SH) or coherent backscattering (CB) based on
readily measured quantities. The CB surge mechanism dominates if the surge is
color dependent, the phase curve is steeper than 0.04 mag/deg, the phase curve
shape matches the CB model of Hapke, or if the albedo is higher than roughly
40%. (2) We find that virtually all of our sample have their phase curves
dominated by CB at low phase angles. (3) We present a graphical method to
determine the Hapke surge parameters B_C0 and h_C. (4) The Kuiper Belt Objects
(KBOs) and Centaurs have relatively high surge amplitudes, B_C0 > ~0.5 and
widths with h_C ~ 3 deg. (5) We find highly significant but loose correlations
between surge properties and the colors, albedos, and inclinations. We
interpret this as young surfaces tending to have low surge slopes, high albedo,
and gray colors. (6) Nereid has its surface properties similar to other icy
moons and greatly different from KBOs and Centaurs, so we conclude that Nereid
is likely a nearly-ejected inner Neptunian moon rather than a captured KBO.

Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). The spatial
velocities of both Clouds are unexpectedly higher than their previous values
resulting from agreement between the available theoretical models of the
Magellanic System and the observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) associated with
the LMC and the SMC. Such proper motion estimates are likely to be at odds with
the scenarios for creation of the large-scale structures in the Magellanic
System suggested so far. We investigated this hypothesis for the pure tidal
models, as they were the first ones devised to explain the evolution of the
Magellanic System, and the tidal stripping is intrinsically involved in every
model assuming the gravitational interaction. The parameter space for the Milky
Way (MW)-LMC-SMC interaction was analyzed by a robust search algorithm (genetic
algorithm) combined with a fast restricted N-body model of the interaction. Our
method extended the known variety of evolutionary scenarios satisfying the
observed kinematics and morphology of the Magellanic large-scale structures.
Nevertheless, assuming the tidal interaction, no satisfactory reproduction of
the HI data available for the Magellanic Clouds was achieved with the new
proper motions. We conclude that for the proper motion data by Kallivayalil et
al., within their 1-sigma errors, the dynamical evolution of the Magellanic
System with the currently accepted total mass of the MW cannot be explained in
the framework of pure tidal models. The optimal value for the western component
of the LMC proper motion was found to be pm_w(LMC) > -1.3 mas/yr in case of
tidal models. It corresponds to the reduction of the Kallivayalil et al. value
for pm_w(LMC) by approx. 40% in its magnitude.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) and Subaru weak lensing observations, combined
with published X-ray temperatures, to examine the distribution of mass and the
intracluster medium (ICM) in massive cluster environments. Our observations
show that A2261 is very similar to A1689 in terms of lensing properties. Many
tangential arcs are visible around A2261, with an effective Einstein radius
\sim 40 arcsec (at z \sim 1.5), which when combined with our weak lensing
measurements implies a mass profile well fitted by an NFW model with a high
concentration c_{vir} \sim 10, similar to A1689 and to other massive clusters.
The cluster A2142 shows complex mass substructure, and displays a shallower
profile (c_{vir} \sim 5), consistent with detailed X-ray observations which
imply recent interaction. The AMiBA map of A2142 exhibits an SZE feature
associated with mass substructure lying ahead of the sharp north-west edge of
the X-ray core suggesting a pressure increase in the ICM. For A2390 we obtain
highly elliptical mass and ICM distributions at all radii, consistent with
other X-ray and strong lensing work. Our cluster gas fraction measurements,
free from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, are overall in good agreement
with published X-ray and SZE observations, with the sample-averaged gas
fraction of <f_{gas}> = 0.133 \pm 0.027, for our sample <M_{vir}> = (1.2 \pm
0.1) \times 10^{15} M_{sun} h^{-1}. When compared to the cosmic baryon fraction
f_b = \Omega_b/\Omega_m constrained by the WMAP 5-year data, this indicates
<f_{gas}>/f_b = 0.78 \pm 0.16, i.e., (22 \pm 16)% of the baryons are missing

Supernova Remnant RX J1713.7-3946 is discussed both in the light of new
observations and from a theoretical point of view.
  Methods. The existing good spatial correlation of the gamma-ray emission and
the nonthermal X-ray emission is analyzed theoretically. In addition, the
recently published new H.E.S.S. observations define the energy spectrum more
precisely, in particular at the high and low energy ends of the instrument's
dynamical range. There now exist much more constraining X-ray observations from
Suzaku that extend substantially beyond 10 keV. These new data are compared
with the authors' previous theoretical predictions, both for dominant hadronic
and for simple inverse Compton models.
  Results. Apart from the well-known MHD correlation between magnetic field
strength and plasma density variations, emphasized by the wind-bubble-structure
of the remnant, it is argued that the regions of magnetic field amplification
also are correlated with enhanced densities of accelerated nuclear particles
and the associated streaming instabilities. Therefore a correlation of
nonthermal X-ray and \gr emission is not only possible but even to be expected
for a hadronic emission scenario. A leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission
would require an implausibly uniform strength of the magnetic field. The
observational and theoretical inferences about substantial field amplification
in this remnant agree very well with the recent X-ray and \gr observations.
  Conclusions. All this argues strongly for the dominance of hadronic \grs in
the \gr emission spectrum and a fortiori for an overwhelming contribution of
nuclear cosmic ray particles to the nonthermal energy in this remnant.
