proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic
ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M_chi ~ 500 - 800 GeV
that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a
thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken
together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in
the dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the
annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale
annihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.
If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass
can force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a
non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and
splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~
MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to
explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the
INTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected,
providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter
(iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld
enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at
redshift ~10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history
of the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional
WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way
subhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.

striking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations. The WIMP is taken to be
charged under a hidden gauge symmetry G_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this
also provides the necessary ingredients for the ""exciting"" and ""inelastic"" Dark
Matter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we
point out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple
picture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale
arises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.
The theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely
generic prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays
of MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn
decay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the
lightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into
light SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of
all SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2
leptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.
Furthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard
Model, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new
long-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.

the Standard Model only via an intermediate light scalar which mixes with the
Higgs: this leads to a suppression in the nuclear scattering cross section
relative to models in which the WIMPs couple to the Higgs directly. We estimate
this suppression factor to be of order 10^(-5). The elastic nuclear scattering
cross section for XDM can also be computed directly: we perform this
computation for XDM coupled to the Higgs sector of the Standard Model and find
a spin-independent cross section in the order of 4 x 10^(-13) pb in the
decoupling limit, which is not within the range of any near-term direct
detection experiments. However, if the XDM dark sector is instead coupled to a
two-Higgs-doublet model, the spin-independent nuclear scattering cross section
can be enhanced by up to four orders of magnitude for large tan(beta), which
should be observable in the upcoming SuperCDMS and ton-scale xenon experiments.

mean-vorticity dynamo effect pioneered by Elperin, Kleeorin, and Rogachevskii
in 2003 (Phys. Rev. E 68, 016311). This effect is based on the anisotropy of
the eddy viscosity tensor. One of its components may be able to replenish
cross-stream mean flows by acting upon the streamwise component of the mean
flow. Shear, in turn, closes the loop by acting upon the cross-stream mean flow
to produce stronger streamwise mean flows. The diagonal component of the eddy
viscosity is found to be of the order of the rms turbulent velocity divided by
the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies.

the LHC. The main challenge in identifying energetic top quarks is that the
decay products become increasingly collimated. This reduces the efficacy of
conventional methods that exploit the topology of the top decay chain. We focus
on the cases where the decay products of the top quark are reconstructed as a
single jet, a ""top-jet"". The most basic ""top-tag"" method based on jet mass
measurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,
theoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.
Based on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the
shape of the QCD jet mass spectrum. We observe a good agreement with the Monte
Carlo simulation. We consider high-p_T t\bar{t} production in the Standard
Model as an example, and show that our theoretical QCD jet mass distributions
can efficiently characterize the background via sideband analyses. We show that
with 25 fb^{-1} of data, our approach allows us to resolve top-jets with p_T
$\ge$ 1 TeV from the QCD background, and about 1.5 TeV top-jets with 100
fb^{-1}, without relying on b-tagging. To further improve the significance we
consider jet shapes (analyzed in 0807.0234 [hep-ph]), which resolve the
substructure of energy flow inside cone jets. A method of measuring top quark
polarization by using the b-quark p_T is also presented. The main advantages of
our approach are: (i) the mass distributions are driven by first principle
calculations, instead of relying solely on Monte Carlo simulation; (ii) for
high p_T jets (p_T $\ge$1 TeV), IR-safe jet shape variables are robust against
detector resolution effects. Our analysis is applicable to other boosted
massive particles such as the electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs.

ages from approximately 3 Myr to 3 Gyr. We identify 46 sources that exhibit
excess infrared emission above the stellar photosphere at 24um, and 21 sources
with excesses at 70um. Five sources with an infrared excess have
characteristics of optically thick primordial disks, while the remaining
sources have properties akin to debris systems. The fraction of systems
exhibiting a 24um excess greater than 10.2% above the photosphere is 15% for
ages < 300 Myr and declines to 2.7% for older ages. The upper envelope to the
70um fractional luminosity appears to decline over a similar age range. The
characteristic temperature of the debris inferred from the IRS spectra range
between 60 and 180 K, with evidence for the presence of cooler dust to account
for the strength of the 70um excess emission. No strong correlation is found
between dust temperature and stellar age. Comparison of the observational data
with disk models containing a power-law distribution of silicate grains suggest
that the typical inner disk radius is > 10 AU. Although the interpretation is
not unique, the lack of excess emission shortwards of 16um and the relatively

effective field theory description of the Standard Model and just their first
Kaluza-Klein excitations from a warped extra dimension. The warped 5D framework
can provide solutions to both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchies of the SM.
It is also related (via the AdS/CFT correspondence) to partial compositeness of
the SM. We focus on the dominant contributions in the two-site model to two
observables which we argue provide the strongest flavor constraints, namely,
epsilon_K and BR(b -> s gamma), where contributions in the two-site model occur
at tree and loop-level, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate that a
""tension"" exists between these two observables in the sense that they have
opposite dependence on composite site Yukawa couplings, making it difficult to
decouple flavor-violating effects using this parameter. We choose the size of
the composite site QCD coupling based on the relation of the two-site model to
the 5D model (addressing the Planck-weak hierarchy), where we match the 5D QCD
coupling to the 4D coupling at the loop-level and assuming negligible
tree-level brane-localized kinetic terms. We estimate that a larger size of the
5D gauge coupling is constrained by the requirement of 5D perturbativity. We
find that \sim O(5) TeV mass scale for the new particles in the two-site model
can then be consistent with both observables. We also compare our analysis of
epsilon_K in the two-site model to that in 5D models, including both the cases
of a brane-localized and bulk Higgs.

BPs and increases in the magnetic field, implying that the Ca II H passband is
a good indicator for the concentration of magnetic flux. Doppler velocities
between 6 and 15 km/s are derived from the Fe XII and Fe XIII lines for the BP
region, while for Fe XIV and Si VII they are in the range from -15 to +15 km/s.
The coronal electron density is 3.7x10^9 cm^-3. An excellent correlation is
found between the positive magnetic flux and the X-ray light-curves. The
remarkable agreement between the extrapolated magnetic field configuration and
some of the loops composing the BP as seen in the X-ray images suggests that a
large fraction of the magnetic field in the bright point is close to potential.
The close correlation between the positive magnetic flux and the X-ray emission
suggests that energy released by magnetic reconnection is stimulated by flux

The model, which is of reaction-diffusion type, takes into account the complex
interactions between the tumor and surrounding stromal cells by including
densities of endothelial cells and the extra-cellular matrix. When no treatment
is applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The
initially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of
millimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the
tumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and
establishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model
we apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces
the proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the
capability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to
determine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more
important of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we
considered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor
cells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from
the blood vessels. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of
the drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact
accelerate the growth rate of the tumor. This result seems to be due to
complicated interplay between the stromal and tumor cell types and highlights
the importance of considering chemotherapy in a spatial context.

new formulation of micro-phenomena based on the principles of reality and
causality. The new theory provides with us a new depiction of micro-phenomena
assuming an unified concept of information, matter and energy. So, we suppose
that in a definite micro-physical context (including other interacting
particles), each particle is enfolded by a probability field whose existence is
contingent upon the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the
physical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of
the whole particle-field system obeys deterministic equations in a manner that
when the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the field also
experiences a conservative complex force which its form is determined by the
dynamics of particle. So, the field is endowed with a given amount of energy,
but its value is contingent upon the physical conditions the particle is
subjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated
field, we argue why the field has a probabilistic objective nature. In such a
way, the basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some
stationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are
discussed here.

sojourn times) for quantum scattering pairs $\{H_0=h(P),H\}$, where $h(P)$ a
dispersive operator of hypoelliptic-type. For instance $h(P)$ can be one of the
usual elliptic operators such as the Schr\""odinger operator $h(P)=P^2$ or the
square-root Klein-Gordon operator $h(P)=\sqrt{1+P^2}$. We show under general
conditions that the symmetrised time delay exists for all smooth even
localization functions. It is equal to the Eisenbud-Wigner time delay plus a
contribution due to the non-radial component of the localization function. If
the scattering operator $S$ commutes with some function of the velocity
operator $\nabla h(P)$, then the time delay also exists and is equal to the
symmetrised time delay. As an illustration of our results we consider the case
of a one-dimensionnal Friedrichs Hamiltonian perturbed by a finite rank
potential.
  Our study put into evidence an integral formula relating the operator of
differentiation with respect to the kinetic energy $h(P)$ to the time evolution
of localization operators.

scatters from one of the slits at a given time. After the scattering through
one of the slits, the particle shares some of its energy with its surrounding
field and a particle-field system is again formed which its motion is governed
by a deterministic dynamics during its flight towards the detecting screen. The
interference pattern is then explained by showing how the final location of
each particle-field system at the time of reaching the detecting screen is
distributed according to an angular distribution (equal to the what quantum
theory predicts for the fringe effects in a two-slit experiment). The
probabilistic nature of such a distribution can be explained by considering the
variations of the kinetic energy of the particle-field system at different
local situations.

by local Maxwellian distributions. Kinematic modelling provides deprojected 3D
kinematic parameters, including the mass profile of the cluster. We find an

distribution of the cluster stars compared to a uniform, spherical model
cluster. Using upper limits on accelerations, we constrain the minimum
line-of-sight distances from the plane of SgrA* of five stars located within
the innermost few (projected) arcsec. The stars within 0.7'' radius from the
star group IRS13E do not co-move with this group, making it unlikely that
IRS13E is the core of a substantial star cluster. Overall, the GC late-type
cluster is described well as a uniform, isotropic, rotating, dynamically
relaxed, phase-mixed system.

rate of cosmological recombination. We approach this problem within the
standard formulation, and corrections due to two-photon interactions are
deferred to another paper. As a main result we show here that within a
non-stationary approach to the escape problem, the resulting correction in the
free electron fraction, N_e, is about ~1.6-1.8% in the redshift range
800<~z<~1200. Therefore the discussed process results in one of the largest
modifications to the ionization history close to the maximum of
Thomson-visibility function at z~1100 considered so far. We prove our results
both numerically and analytically, deriving the escape probability, and
considering both Lyman-alpha line emission and line absorption in a way
different from the Sobolev approximation. In particular, we give a detailed
derivation of the Sobolev escape probability during hydrogen recombination, and
explain the underlying assumptions. We then discuss the escape of photons for
the case of coherent scattering in the lab frame, solving this problem
analytically in the quasi-stationary approximation and also in the
time-dependent case. We show here that during hydrogen recombination the
Sobolev approximation for the escape probability is not valid at the level of
DP/P~5-10%. This is because during recombination the ionization degree changes
significantly over a characteristic time Dz/z~10%, so that at percent level

convex domains is obtained from a probability measure on convex surfaces that
is induced by the Wiener measure on Brownian bridges the convex surfaces are
the hulls of. The vacuum force on the piston by a scalar field satisfying
Dirichlet boundary conditions is attractive in these geometries, but the
strength and short-distance behavior of the force depends crucially on the
shape of the piston casing. For a cylindrical casing with a hemispherical head,
the force for $a/R\sim 0$ does not depend on the dimension of the casing and
numerically approaches $\sim - 0.00326(4)\hbar c/a^2$. Semiclassically this
asymptotic force is due to short, closed and non-periodic trajectories that

$-\hbar c/(96\pi a^2)(1+2\sqrt{R^2-r^2}/a)$ for the force when $a/r\ll r/R\leq

look at the stability of axisymmetric field configurations and in particular at
the relative strengths of the toroidal and poloidal components. Both toroidal
and poloidal fields are unstable on their own, and stability is achieved by
adding the two together in some ratio. I use Tayler's (1973) stability
conditions for toroidal fields and other analytic tools to predict the range of
stable ratios and then check these predictions by running numerical
simulations. It is found that while the poloidal field can account for no more
than approximately 80% of the total energy, it can account for a very small
fraction of the energy, i.e. that the toroidal field can be -- and is likely to
be -- significantly stronger than the poloidal. Furthermore, the weaker the
field, the weaker the poloidal component can be in relation to the toroidal.
The implications of this result are discussed in various contexts such as the

0.4<z<0.8, using data from the 2SLAQ Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) survey. We find
that radio-detected LRGs (with optical luminosities of 3-5L* and 1.4GHz radio
powers between 1e24 and 1e26 W/Hz) are significantly more clustered than a
matched sample of radio-quiet LRGs with the same distribution in optical
luminosity and colour. The measured scale length of the 2pt auto-correlation
function, r0, is 12.3+/-1.2 1/h Mpc and 9.02+/-0.52 1/h Mpc for the
radio-detected and radio-quiet samples respectively. Using the halo model
framework we demonstrate that the radio-loud LRGs have typical halo masses of
10.1+/-1.4 x10^13 1/h M_sun compared to 6.44+/-0.32 x10^13 1/h M_sun for the
radio-quiet sample. A model in which the radio-detected LRGs are almost all
central galaxies within haloes provides the best fit, and we estimate that at
least 30% of LRGs with the same clustering amplitude as the radio-detected LRGs
are currently radio-loud. Our results imply that radio-loud LRGs typically
occupy more massive haloes than other LRGs of the same optical luminosity, so
the probability of finding a radio-loud AGN in a massive galaxy at z~0.55 is
influenced by the halo mass in addition to the dependence on optical
luminosity. If we model the radio-loud fraction of LRGs, F_rad, as a function
of halo mass M, then the data are well-fitted by a power law of the form F_rad
\propto M^(0.65+/-0.23). The relationship between radio emission and clustering
strength could arise either through a higher fuelling rate of gas onto the
central black holes of galaxies in the most massive haloes (producing more
powerful radio jets) or through the presence of a denser IGM (providing a more
efficient working surface for the jets, thus boosting their radio luminosity).

brown dwarfs are key to understanding the physics underlying their formation
and evolution. While there has been great progress over the last decade in
studying the bulk spectrophotometric properties of low-mass objects, direct
determination of their masses, radii, and temperatures have been very sparse.
Thus, theoretical predictions of low-mass evolution and ultracool atmospheres
remain to be rigorously tested. The situation is alarming given that such
models are widely used, from the determination of the low-mass end of the
initial mass function to the characterization of exoplanets. An increasing
number of mass, radius, and age determinations are placing critical constraints
on the physics of low-mass objects. A wide variety of approaches are being
pursued, including eclipsing binary studies, astrometric-spectroscopic orbital
solutions, interferometry, and characterization of benchmark systems. In
parallel, many more systems suitable for concerted study are now being found,
thanks to new capabilities spanning both the very widest (all-sky surveys) and
very narrowest (diffraction-limited adaptive optics) areas of the sky. This
Cool Stars 15 splinter session highlighted the current successes and
limitations of this rapidly growing area of precision astrophysics.

If the TeV flares observed from PKS 2155-304 in 2006 July are assumed to
originate from a black hole with mass $\approx 10^8 M_8 M_\odot$, then the
$\sim 5$ minute variability timescale is consistent with the light-travel time
across the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole if $M_8\sim 1$. The absolute
jet power in a synchrotron/SSC model exceeds, however, the Eddington luminosity
for a black hole with $M_8\sim 1$ unless the jet is highly efficient. The
maximum Blandford-Znajek power is $\sim 10^{46}M_8$ ergs s$^{-1}$ if the
magnetic-field energy density threading the horizon is equated with the
luminous energy density in the vicinity of the black hole. An external Compton
component can relax power requirements, so a black hole with mass $\sim 10^8
M_\odot$ could explain the observed flaring behavior. For the Swift and HESS
data taken in 2006 July, relativistic outflows with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma
\gtrsim 30$ satisfy $\gamma$-$\gamma$ attenuation limits. If this system
harbors a binary black hole, then the accretion disk from a more massive, $\sim

component. Dual thermal accretion disk signatures would confirm this scenario.

\msun$) due to stellar-dynamical processes in the first stellar clusters formed
at early cosmic times ($z\sim10-20$). The high redshift black hole seeds form
as a result of multiple successive instabilities that occur in low metallicity
$Z\sim 10^{-5}Z_\odot$) protogalaxies. We focus on relatively massive halos at
high redshift ($T_{\rm vir} > 10^4$ K, $z\gsim 10$) after the very first stars
in the Universe have completed their evolution. This set of assumptions ensures
that (i) atomic hydrogen cooling can contribute to the gas cooling process,
(ii) a UV field has been created by the first stars, and (iii) the gas inside
the halo has been mildly polluted by the first metals. The second condition
implies that at low density $H_2$ is dissociated and does not contribute to
cooling. The third condition sets a minimum threshold density for
fragmentation, so that stars form efficiently only in the very inner core of
the protogalaxy. Within this core, very compact stellar clusters form. A large
fraction of these very dense clusters undergo core collapse before stars are
able to complete stellar evolution. Runaway star-star collisions eventually
lead to the formation of a very massive star, leaving behind a massive black
hole remnant. Clusters unstable to runaway collisions are always the first,
less massive ones that form. Typically a fraction $\sim 0.05$ of protogalaxies
at $z\sim10-20$ form black hole seeds, with masses $\sim 1000-2000 \msun$,
leading to a mass density in seeds of a few $\simeq10^2\msun/{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$.
This density allows enough room for black hole growth by accretion during the
quasar epoch.

general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical simulations of a
radiatively-cooled black-hole accretion disk. The fiducial simulation combines
a total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which
includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. By comparison with
other simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion
flows, radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without
necessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.
We further compare the results of our radiatively-cooled simulation to the
predictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows. For the
very low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk, we
closely match a state called the ""transition"" solution between an outer
advection-dominated accretion flow and what would be a magnetically-dominated
accretion flow (MDAF) in the interior. The qualitative and quantitative
agreement between the numerical and analytic models is quite good, with only a
few well-understood exceptions. According to the analytic model then, at
significantly higher stress or accretion, we would expect a full MDAF to form.
The collection of simulations in this work also provide important data for
interpreting other numerical results in the literature, as they span the most
common treatments of thermodynamics, including simulations evolving: 1) the
internal energy only; 2) the internal energy plus an explicit cooling function;
3) the total energy without cooling; and 4) total energy including cooling. We
find that the total energy formulation is a necessary prerequisite for proper
treatment of radiative cooling in MRI accretion flows.

Varying the parameter p from p=0 (3-regular graph of infinite dimension) to p=1

such structural changes. Both processes are expected to exhibit mean-field
features for p=0 and features typical of the directed percolation universality
class for p=1. The analysis is undertaken by means of Monte Carlo simulations
and the application of mean-field theory. The quasi-stationary simulation
method is used to obtain the phase diagram for the processes in this
environment along with critical exponents. Predictions for critical exponents
obtained from mean-field theory are found to agree with simulation results over
a large range of values for p up to a value of p=0.95, where the system is
found to sharply cross over to the one-dimensional case. Estimates of critical
thresholds given by mean-field theory are found to underestimate the

before the main burst. The other is the main outflow, which causes the prompt
GRB emission and the initial steep decay phase of the X-ray afterglow. In this
model, the transition from the plateau to the subsequent normal decay phase is
an artifact of the choice of the zero of time. For events with distinct plateau
phase, the central engine is active 10^3-10^4 sec before the launch of the main
outflow. According to this model, a prior emission in the X-ray and/or optical

there are now two known companions: our new discovery and a previously known

$\sigma\propto\lambda^\nu$. We place an upper limit on the Gaussian width of
the $r^\prime$-band emission region of $1.80 \times 10^{16} h_{70}^{-1/2}

numerical simulation. We simulate gas flow in the whole galaxy disk with nested
bars, which are the outer bar and the inner bar, especially with highly spatial
resolution in the galactic central region. We assume two cases of inner bar
size which are a smaller one and a larger one than the radius of the 200 pc gas
ring which is corresponds to the Central Molecular Zone. From our numerical
results, in the large size bar cases, the inner bars with large elongation
induce sufficient mass inflow and destroy the 200 pc gas ring. On the other
hand, in the small size bar cases, the inner bars with large elongation induce
large mass inflow and do not destroy the 200 pc gas ring. This mass inflow is
caused by straight shocks excited by the inner bar. In this case, nuclear gas
disks of ~ 15 pc radius are formed. The nuclear gas disks are
self-gravitationally unstable and we expect formation of compact star clusters
under strong tidal force in the nuclear gas disks. We discuss evolution of the
nuclear gas disk.

unusually high hardness and low flux. In particular, we study the
characteristic frequencies seen in the PDS and the hardness-flux correlation
within and between these observations.
  Methods. We analyse observations of Cyg X-1 during periods when the source
reaches its highest hardness levels (> 1 for the 9-20 keV over 2-4 keV RXTE/PCA
count ratios, corresponding to Gamma < 1.6). Using the relativistic precession
model to interpret the PDS we estimate a value for the inner radius of the
accretion disc. We also study the hardness-flux correlation.
  Results. In the selected observations, the characteristic frequencies seen in
the power spectrum are shifted to the lowest end of their frequency range.
Within a single observation, the hardness-flux correlation is very weak,
contrary to the negative correlation normally observed in the hard state. We
suggest that this could be interpreted as the inner disc boundary being at
large radii (> 50 Rg), thereby requiring more time to adjust to a changing
accretion rate than allowed by a single RXTE observation, and compare our
findings to estimates of the viscous time scale responsible for small scale
variability in the system.

Characteristic temporal and frequency scales of diffractive scintillations at
these frequencies have been determined. The comprehensive analysis of the
frequency and temporal structure functions reduced to the same frequency has
shown that the spectrum of interstellar plasma inhomogeneities toward both
pulsars is described by a power law. The exponent of the spectrum of
fluctuations of interstellar plasma inhomogeneities toward PSR B0950+08 (n =
3.00 +- 0.05) appreciably differs from the Kolmogorov exponent. Toward PSR
B0809+74 the spectrum is a power law with an exponent n = 3.7 +- 0.1. A strong
angular refraction has been detected toward PSR B0950+08. The distribution of
inhomogeneities along the line of sight has been analyzed; it has been shown
that the scintillations of PSR B0950+08 take place on a turbulent layer with
enhanced electron density, which is localized at approximately 10 pc from the
observer. For PSR B0809+74 the distribution of inhomogeneities is
quasi-uniform. Mean-square fluctuations of electron density on inhomogeneities
with a characteristic scale rho_0 = 10^7 m toward four pulsars have been
estimated. On this scale the local turbulence level in the 10-pc layer is 20
times higher than in an extended region responsible for the scintillations of

oscillators on sparse random networks is investigated. Extensive numerical
simulations show that correlations between the native frequencies of adjacent
oscillators on the network systematically shift the critical point as well as
the critical exponents characterizing the transition. Negative correlations
imply an onset of synchronization for smaller coupling, whereas positive
correlations shift the critical coupling towards larger interaction strengths.
For negatively correlated oscillators the transition still exhibits critical
behaviour similar to the all-to-all coupled Kuramoto system, while positive
correlations change the universality class of the transition depending on the
correlation strength. Crucially, the paper demonstrates that the
synchronization behaviour is not only determined by the coupling architecture,

multimedia applications. To get more bandwidth, multipath routing is one
appropriate solution provided that inter-path interferences are minimized. In
this paper, we address the problem of interfering paths in the context of
wireless multimedia sensor networks and consider both intra-session as well as
inter-session interferences. Our main objective is to provide necessary
bandwidth to multimedia applications through non-interfering paths while
increasing the network lifetime. To do so, we adopt an incremental approach
where for a given session, only one path is built at once. Additional paths are
built when required, typically in case of congestion or bandwidth shortage.
Interference awareness and energy saving are achieved by switching a subset of
sensor nodes in a {\em passive state} in which they do not take part in the
routing process. Despite the routing overhead introduced by the incremental
approach we adopt, our simulations show that this can be compensated by the
overall achieved throughput and the amount of consumed energy per correctly
received packet especially for relatively long sessions such as multimedia
ones. This is mainly due to the fact that a small number of non-interfering
paths allows for better performances than a large number of interfering ones.

profiles with velocity extents similar to the main isotopologue. The main
motivation for the survey was the search of high-velocity (100-1000 km/s)
outflows in the BN/KL region as traced by SiO Doppler components. Some of the
unidentified lines in principle could be high-velocity SiO features, but
without imaging data their location cannot be established.
  Wings of emission are present in the v=0 28SiO, 29SiO and 30SiO profiles, and
we suggest that the v=0 emission from the three isotopologues might trace a
moderately high-velocity (~30-50 km/s) component of the flows around the
high-mass protostar Source I in the Orion BN/KL region.
  We also confirm the 7 mm detection of a complex oxygen-bearing species,
acetone (CH3COCH3), which has been recently observed towards the hot core at 3
mm, and we have found further indications of the presence of long cyanopolyynes
(HC5N and HC7N) in the quiescent cold gas of the extended ridge.

multi-band optical photometry, optical spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and

different spectral regions, finding a smooth optical continuum with a
remarkable lack of lines and a very blue component modulated with a period of
3.2hr and a hard power-law X-ray spectrum. Both the X-ray and optical power
spectra are flat at low frequencies up to the 0.1 Hz (10 s) range, then
decreasing roughly as a power law consistent with flickering. Furthermore, the
optical data show quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) near 0.08 Hz (13 s).
Together with a dynamical and auto-correlation analysis of the light curves we
attempt to construct a complete physical picture of this intriguing system.

active regions at photospheric and chromospheric levels in young single stars.
Since our targets are slow rotators (vsini < 25 km/s), corresponding to
rotation periods larger than about 2 days, we are able to apply the
spectroscopic technique based on line-depth ratio for the measure of the
photospheric temperature modulation. These stars, possible members of Stellar
Kinematic Groups, display emission cores in the CaII H&K and IRT lines, as well
as a conspicuous filling-in of the Halpha core. Moreover, we detect absorption
of the HeI-D3 line, coming from the upper chromospheric layers, derive the
lithium abundance (age indicator), and measure the rotational and radial
velocities. We find a clear rotational modulation, due to photospheric spots,
both in the light and the temperature curves. The Halpha and the CaII-IRT
emissions display a fair variation correlated with the rotation. Finally, we
are developing a spot/plage model to reproduce the data and derive the spot
parameters (namely, filling factor and temperature) and to recover information
about the chromospheric inhomogeneities (flux contrast and filling factor).
This study is very important to explore the correlations between global stellar
parameters (e.g., surface gravity, effective temperature) and spot/plage
characteristics in stars with different activity level and evolutionary stage.

analysis of generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). These models support a
variety of interesting regression-type analyses, but performing inference is
often extremely difficult, even when using the Bayesian approach combined with
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The Sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC) is a
new and general method for producing samples from posterior distributions. In
this article we demonstrate use of the SMC method for performing inference for
GLMMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on both simulated and
real data, and find that sequential Monte Carlo is a competitive alternative to
the available MCMC techniques.

show a discrepancy in the low-Q^2 (four-momentum transfer squared) region. The
calculations rely on the assumption, called the impulse approximation, that the
nucleus the neutrino scatters off can be described as a collection of
independent nucleons and therefore only one nucleon takes part in the
interaction. It is known from electron scattering that such picture is valid
only when transferred momentum |q|>400 MeV/c. For lower |q|'s, the nucleus is
probed with a lower spatial resolution and a few nucleons are involved in the
scattering, so the use of the impulse approximation is unjustified. It means
that the standard calculations of the cross sections are unreliable for |q|<400
MeV/c. I show that the contribution of low-momentum interactions to the
quasielastic neutrino cross section cannot be reduced below ~19% by any
selection of the beam energy in the few-GeV region. Moreover, low-Q^2 neutrino
events happen only when transferred momentum is low too. Hence the discrepancy
in the low-Q^2 region is caused by the inappropriate description of low-|q|
interactions in the models commonly used in Monte Carlo simulations.

dramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolved

interference channel with secrecy constraints. Two distinct models, namely the
interference channel with confidential messages and the one with an external
eavesdropper, are analyzed. The key difference between the two models is the
lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external eavesdropper. Using
interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding, it is shown that each
user can achieve non-zero secure Degrees of Freedom (DoF) for both cases. More
precisely, the proposed coding scheme achieves $\frac{K-2}{2K-2}$ secure DoF
{\em with probability one} per user in the confidential messages model. For the
external eavesdropper scenario, on the other hand, it is shown that each user
can achieve $\frac{K-2}{2K}$ secure DoF {\em in the ergodic setting}.
Remarkably, these results establish the {\em positive impact} of interference
on the secrecy capacity region of wireless networks.

the ONC) to 4.5 Gyr (the age of the Sun), solar-like stars lose about 1-2
orders of specific angular momentum. The main agents for this rotational
braking are believed to be star-disk interaction and magnetically powered
stellar winds. Over the last decade, the observational fundament to probe the
stellar spindown has dramatically improved. Significant progress has been made
in exploring the underlying physical causes of the rotational braking.
Parameterized models combining the effects of star-disk interaction, winds, and
pre-main sequence contraction are able to reproduce the main features of the
rotational data for stars spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude in age. This
has allowed us to constrain stellar ages based on the rotation rates
('gyrochronology'). One main challenge for future work is to extend this type
of analysis to the substellar mass range, where the rotational database is
still sparse. More theoretical and observational work is required to explore
the physics of the braking processes, aiming to explain rotational evolution
from first principles. In this review for Cool Stars 15, I will summarize the
status quo and the recent developments in the field.

parity-check matrix of an LDPC code and developing an optimized parity-check
matrix, with the same performance on the memory-less erasure channel, and
suitable also for the iterative correction of single bursts of erasures. The
parity-check matrix optimization is performed by an algorithm called pivot
searching and swapping (PSS) algorithm, which executes permutations of
carefully chosen columns of the parity-check matrix, after a local analysis of
particular variable nodes called stopping set pivots. This algorithm can be in
principle applied to any LDPC code. If the input parity-check matrix is
designed for achieving good performance on the memory-less erasure channel,
then the code obtained after the application of the PSS algorithm provides good
joint correction of independent erasures and single erasure bursts. Numerical
results are provided in order to show the effectiveness of the PSS algorithm
when applied to different categories of LDPC codes.

projected rotational velocities of its members; an estimate of its metallicity
was obtained as well. Two exceptionally low rotating A-type stars turned out to
be a strong magnetic Ap star in one case, and a normal A0 star with near-solar
metallicity in the other. The dynamical results showed that NGC 2516 and
Mamajek 2 may have had a common origin at the age of 135 $\pm$ 5 Myr. This
dynamical age confirms the individual ages of 140 Myr for NGC 2516 and 120
$\pm$ 25 Myr for Mamajek 2 obtained independently by photometric methods. Both
these groups appear to have the same solar metallicity giving support to a
common birth scenario. The dynamical approach is showing that some bound open

second brightest Wolf-Rayet binary in optical wavelengths. The system consists
of a short-period (19.1375 days) WC5/WC6 + O6/O7V binary and possibly has an
additional O supergiant companion (O9.5/B0Iab) which is optically identified at
a separation of ~46 mas. Strong emission lines from highly ionized ions of C,
O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe are detected. The spectra are fitted by a
multi-temperature thin-thermal plasma model with an interstellar absorption N_H
= 2--3*10**21 cm**-2. Lack of nitrogen line indicates that the abundance of
carbon is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of nitrogen. A
Doppler shift of ~630 km/s is detected for the OVIII line, while similar shifts
are obtained from the other lines. The reddening strongly suggests that the
emission lines originated from the wind-wind shock zone, where the average
velocity is ~600 km/s. The red-shift motion is inconsistent with a scenario in
which the X-rays originate from the wind-wind collision zone in the
short-period binary, and would be evidence supporting the widely separated O
supergiant as a companion. This may make up the collision zone be lying behind
the short-period binary. In addition to the emission lines, we also detected
the RRC (radiative recombination continuum) structure from carbon around 0.49
keV. This implies the existence of additional cooler plasma.

Poissonian distribution of field sources (stars, galaxies,...) in different
dimensions of space d. In d=3, it is given by a Levy law called the Holtsmark
distribution. It presents an algebraic tail for large fluctuations due to the
contribution of the nearest neighbor. In d=2, it is given by a marginal
Gaussian distribution intermediate between Gaussian and Levy laws. In d=1, it
is exactly given by the Bernouilli distribution (for any particle number N)
which becomes Gaussian for N>>1. Therefore, the dimension d=2 is critical
regarding the statistics of the gravitational force. We generalize these
results for inhomogeneous systems with arbitrary power-law density profile and
arbitrary power-law force in a d-dimensional universe.

of a given corpus can be inferred on the basis of statistical information
gathered on that corpus. Inferences can be made on the categories of the words
in the vocabulary, and on their syntactical properties within particular
languages. Based on the same statistical data, it is possible to build matrices
of syntagmatic similarity (bigram transition matrices) or paradigmatic
similarity (probability for any pair of words to share common contexts). When
clustered with respect to their syntagmatic similarity, words tend to group
into sublanguage vocabularies, and when clustered with respect to their
paradigmatic similarity, into syntactic or semantic classes. Experiments have
explored the first of these two possibilities. Their results are interpreted in
the frame of a Markov chain modelling of the corpus' generative processe(s): we
show that the results of a spectral analysis of the transition matrix can be
interpreted as probability distributions of words within clusters. This method
yields a soft clustering of the vocabulary into sublanguages which contribute
to the generation of heterogeneous corpora. As an application, we show how
multilingual texts can be visually segmented into linguistically homogeneous
segments. Our method is specifically useful in the case of related languages
which happened to be mixed in corpora.

analysis of new multi-wavelength VLA observations of eleven very powerful
classical double (FRIIb) radio galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 1.3 is
presented. We estimate ages and velocities for each side of each source. The
eleven new sources are combined with previously studied samples and the
characteristics of the full sample of 31 sources are studied; the full sample
includes sources with redshifts between 0.056 and 1.79, and core-hot spot sizes
of about 30 to 400 kpc. The velocities are independent of core-hotspot
separation, suggesting the rate of growth of a given source is roughly constant
over the source lifetime. We combine the rate of growth, width, and pressure of
a source to study the beam power, lifetime, energy, and ambient gas density
using standard methods previously applied to smaller samples. Typical beam
powers are in the range from 1E44 to 1E46 erg/s; we show that this quantity is
insensitive to assumptions regarding minimum energy conditions. The beam powers
are independent of core-hotspot separation suggesting that the beam power of a
given source is roughly constant over the source lifetime. Typical total source
lifetimes are found to be about a few E6 to E7 years, and typical total outflow
energies (E/c^2) are found to be about 5(E5 - E6) solar masses. Ambient gas
densities are found to decrease with increasing core-hotspot distance, but have
no redshift dependence. Overall, the results obtained with the sample of 31

corresponding Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) graphs are constructed for each of

multiplicity of the MST graphs' nodes to a good approximation develops a power
like, scale free distribution with the scaling exponent similar as for several
other complex systems studied so far. Furthermore, quantitative arguments in
favor of the hierarchical organization of the world currency exchange network
are provided by relating the structure of the above MST graphs and their
scaling exponents to those that are derived from an exactly solvable
hierarchical network model. A special status of the USD during the period
considered can be attributed to some departures of the MST features, when this
currency (or some other tied to it) is used as reference, from characteristics
typical to such a hierarchical clustering of nodes towards those that
correspond to the random graphs. Even though in general the basic structure of
the MST is robust with respect to changing the reference currency some trace of
a systematic transition from somewhat dispersed -- like the USD case -- towards
more compact MST topology can be observed when correlations increase.

the strong bounds for the $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle:
  $\theta = -15.3^o \pm 1^o$. Moreover, our result manifests also a dramatic
dependence of the width $\Gamma_{\eta\to 2\gamma}$ on the mixing angle
$\theta$.
  This property explains how the relatively small mixing strongly effects the
decay width.

unique insights to the physics of parton energy loss. Because of the large
underlying event multiplicity in $A+A$ collisions, random and correlated
fluctuations in the background can result in the reconstruction of fake jets.
These fake jets must be identified and rejected to obtain the purest jet sample
possible. A large but reducible fake rate of jets reconstructed using an
iterative cone algorithm on HIJING events is observed. The absolute rate of
fake jets exceeds the binary-scaled p+p jet rate below 50 GeV and is not
negligible until 100 GeV. The variable $\Sigma j_{T}$, the sum of the jet
constituent's $E_{T}$ perpendicular to the jet axis, is introduced to identify
and reject fake jets at by a factor of 100 making it negligible. This variable
is shown to not strongly depend on jet energy profiles modified by energy loss.
By studying azimuthal correlations of reconstructed di-jets, the fake jet rate
can be evaluated in data.

-3.5). This sample includes 2488 bar red clump giants, 339 bar M/K-giants, and
318 disk main sequence stars. We measure the first four moments of the stellar
velocity distribution of the red clump giants, and find it to be symmetric and
flat-topped. We also measure the line-of-sight average velocity and dispersion
of the red clump giants as a function of distance in the bar. We detect stellar
streams at the near and far side of the bar with velocity difference > 30 km/s
at l = +-5, but we do not detect two separate streams in Baade's Window. Our
M-giants kinematics agree well with previous studies, but have dispersions
systematically lower than those of the red clump giants by ~ 10 km/s. For the
disk main sequence stars we measure a velocity dispersion of ~ 45 km/s for all
three lines-of-sight, placing a majority of them in the thin disk within 3.5
kpc of the Sun, associated with the Sagittarius spiral arm. We measure the
equivalent widths of the Ca II 8542 line that can be used to infer
metallicities. We find indications of a metallicity gradient with Galactic
longitude, with greater metallicity in Baade's Window. We find the bulge to be
metal-rich, consistent with some previous studies.

and the characteristics of its data traffic, have attracted growing attention
of the physics community. My thesis has considered problems of both aspects.
First I studied the stochastic behavior of TCP, the primary algorithm governing
traffic in the current Internet, in an elementary network scenario consisting
of a standalone infinite-sized buffer and an access link. The effect of the
fast recovery and fast retransmission (FR/FR) algorithms is also considered. I
showed that my model can be extended further to involve the effect of link
propagation delay, characteristic of WAN. I continued my thesis with the
investigation of finite-sized semi-bottleneck buffers, where packets can be
dropped not only at the link, but also at the buffer. I demonstrated that the
behavior of the system depends only on a certain combination of the parameters.
Moreover, an analytic formula was derived that gives the ratio of packet loss
rate at the buffer to the total packet loss rate. This formula makes it
possible to treat buffer-losses as if they were link-losses. Finally, I studied
computer networks from a structural perspective. I demonstrated through fluid
simulations that the distribution of resources, specifically the link
bandwidth, has a serious impact on the global performance of the network. Then
I analyzed the distribution of edge betweenness in a growing scale-free tree
under the condition that a local property, the in-degree of the ""younger"" node
of an arbitrary edge, is known in order to find an optimum distribution of link
capacity. The derived formula is exact even for finite-sized networks. I also
calculated the conditional expectation of edge betweenness, rescaled for
infinite networks.

Our best-fit broadband model to the pn spectrum consists of a moderately flat
(photon index 1.57) hard X-ray power-law absorbed by cold gas with N_H = 3 *
10^21 cm^-2, plus a strong soft excess, modeled as a steep power law with a
photon index of 3.35, absorbed by cold gas with N_H = 9 * 10^20 cm^-2. The soft
excess normalization increases by ~20% in ~20 ks, independently of the hard
X-ray component, and the UV continuum, tracked via the OM, also shows a strong
increasing trend over the observation, consistent with reprocessing of soft
X-ray emission. Warm absorber signatures are evident in both the EPIC and RGS;
we model two layers, with log(xi) = 1.2 and 2.9 erg cm s^-1, and with similar
column densities (~1-2 * 10^21 cm^-2). The outflow velocities relative to
systemic of the high- and low-ionization absorbers are estimated to be
-(2060(+240,-170)) km/s and -(420(+430,-190)) km/s, respectively. The Fe K
alpha line width FWHM is 7000 +/- 1500 km/s; its inferred radius is consistent
with the BLR and with the inner radius of the dust reverberation-mapped by
Suganuma et al. An emission feature near 6.0 keV is modeled equally well as a
narrow redshifted Fe K line, possibly associated with a disk ""hot-spot,"" or as
the red wing to a relativistically broadened Fe line profile. Swift-BAT and
archival RXTE data suggest at most weak Compton reflection (R <~ 0.5), and a
high-energy cutoff near 100 keV. From RXTE monitoring, we find tentative
evidence for a significant fraction of the Fe line flux to track continuum
variations on time scales < 700 days.
