scales cluster-galaxy cross-spectrum probes directly density profile of the
halos, instead of the density profile convolved with itself, as is the case for
the galaxy power spectrum. Due to this different behavior, adding information
from the cross-pairs helps to tighten constraints on the halo occupation
distribution. By inclusion of the cross-pairs a factor of ~2 stronger
constraints are obtained for sigma_8, while the improvement for the dark energy
figure-of-merit is somewhat weaker: an increase by a factor of 1.4.

different scenarios. First, we address the utility maximization problem in a

iterative gradient projection algorithm that uses approximate projection. By
exploiting the polymatroid structure of the capacity region, we show that the

rate and power allocation policies are presented for the case that power
control is possible and channel statistics are available. For the case that
transmission power is fixed and channel statistics are unknown, we propose a
greedy rate allocation policy and provide bounds on the performance difference
of this policy and the optimal policy in terms of channel variations and
structure of the utility function. We present numerical results that
demonstrate superior convergence rate performance for the greedy policy

complexity of the greedy policy, we present approximate rate allocation
policies which track the greedy policy within a certain neighborhood that is

rely on the observation that, in that regime, the stationary statistical
properties of a class of hyperchaotic attractors can be reproduced with a
linear Langevin equation, defined by replacing the non-linear delay force by a
delta-correlated noise. Therefore, the synchronization phenomenon can be
analytically characterized by a set of coupled Langevin equations. We apply
this formalism to study anticipated synchronization dynamics subject to
external noise fluctuations as well as for characterizing the effects of
parameter mismatch in a hyperchaotic communication scheme. The same procedure
is applied to second order differential delay equations associated to

that \alpha ~ const applies, we cut through the rich analytic contents of the
Jeans equation describing the self-gravitating equilibria of the DM; we
specifically focus on computing and discussing a set of novel physical
solutions that we name \alpha-profiles, marked by the entropy slope \alpha
itself, and by the maximal gravitational pull \kappa_crit required for a viable
equilibrium to hold. We then use an advanced semianalytic description for the
cosmological buildup of halos to constrain the values of \alpha to within the
narrow range 1.25-1.29 from galaxies to galaxy systems. Our range of \alpha
applies since the transition time that - both in oursemianalytic description
and in state-of-the-art numerical simulations - separates two development
stages: an early violent collapse that comprises a few major mergers and
enforces dynamical mixing, followed by smoother mass addition through slow
accretion. We also give an accurate analytic representation of the
\alpha-profiles with parameters derived from the Jeans equation. We finally
stress how our findings and predictions as to \alpha and \kappa_crit contribute
to understand hitherto unsolved issues concerning the fundamental structure of

assume that during the supernova (SN) explosion that produced the pulsar, a

Mass accretion could accelerate the neutron star's spin to milliseconds, and
decrease its magnetic field to $\sim 10^8-10^9$ G, provided that there was
sufficient mass ($\sim 0.1 M_{\sun}$) in the fallback disk. The neutron star
became a millisecond pulsar after mass accretion terminated. In the meanwhile
the binary orbit has kept to be eccentric (due to the SN explosion) for $\sim
10^{9}$ yr. We have performed population synthesis calculations of the
evolutions of neutron stars with a fallback disk, and found that there might be
tens to hundreds of PSR J1903+03273-like systems in the Galaxy. This scenario
also suggests that some fraction of isolated millisecond pulsars in the

with similar results obtained by manual detection (CDAW CME catalog). On
average CACTus detects less than 2 events per day during solar minimum up to 8
events during maximum, nearly half of them being narrow (< 20 degrees).
Assuming a correction factor, we find that the CACTus CME rate is surprisingly
consistent with CME rates found during the past 30 years. The CACTus statistics
show that small scale outflow is ubiquitously observed in the outer corona. The
majority of CACTus-only events are narrow transients related to previous CME
activity or to intensity variations in the slow solar wind, reflecting its
turbulent nature. A significant fraction (about 15%) of CACTus-{\it only}
events were identified as independent events, thus not related to other CME
activity. The CACTus CME width distribution is essentially scale invariant in
angular span over a range of scales from 20 to 120 degrees while previous
catalogues present a broad maximum around 30 degrees. The possibility that the
size of coronal mass outflows follow a power law distribution could indicate
that no typical CME size exists, i.e. that the narrow transients are not
different from the larger well-defined CMEs.

rate allocation policy for a fading MAC that implements a low-complexity

explicitly characterize the effect of the speed of temporal channel variations

proposing an alternative rate allocation policy for which tighter bounds on the

representation of the real numbers, to their binary expansion. This function is
peculiar in many ways; one is that its derivative is 'singular'. One can show
by classical techniques that its derivative must vanish on all rationals. Since
the Question Mark itself is continuous, one concludes that the derivative must
be non-zero on the irrationals, and is thus a discontinuous-everywhere
function. This derivative is the subject of this essay.
  Various results are presented here: First, a simple but formal
measure-theoretic construction of the derivative is given, making it clear that
it has a very concrete existence as a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, and thus is
safe to manipulate in various familiar ways. Next, an exact result is given,
expressing the measure as an infinite product of piece-wise continuous
functions, with each piece being a Mobius transform of the form (ax+b)/(cx+d).
This construction is then shown to be the Haar measure of a certain transfer
operator. A general proof is given that any transfer operator can be understood
to be nothing more nor less than a push-forward on a Banach space; such
push-forwards induce an invariant measure, the Haar measure, of which the
Minkowski measure can serve as a prototypical example. Some minor notes
pertaining to it's relation to the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator are made.

a suitable variational characterization for the semi-stability assumption. We
overcome this difficulty by using a general version of Hardy's inequality. In a

as well as maximizing a utility function of the rates. In this work, we make a
connection between these two approaches by showing that the information

bounds for half-duplex protocols with multiple decode and forward relays and
compare these to the same protocols with amplify and forward relays in an
additive white Gaussian noise channel. We consider three novel classes of
half-duplex protocols: the (m,2) 2 phase protocol with m relays, the (m,3) 3
phase protocol with m relays, and general (m, t) Multiple Hops and Multiple
Relays (MHMR) protocols, where m is the total number of relays and 3<t< m+3 is
the number of temporal phases in the protocol. The (m,2) and (m,3) protocols
extend previous bi-directional relaying protocols for a single m=1 relay, while
the new (m,t) protocol efficiently combines multi-hop routing with
message-level network coding. Finally, we provide a comprehensive treatment of
the MHMR protocols with decode and forward relaying and amplify and forward
relaying in the Gaussian noise, obtaining their respective achievable rate
regions, outer bounds and relative performance under different SNRs and relay
geometries, including an analytical comparison on the protocols at low and high

the enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM), we present X-ray surface
brightness, temperature, and Fe abundance profiles for a set of twelve galaxy
clusters for which we have extensive optical photometry. Assuming a standard
IMF and simple chemical evolution model scaled to match the present-day cluster
early-type SN Ia rate, the stars in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the
intracluster stars (ICS) generate 31^{+11}_{-9}%, on average, of the observed
ICM Fe within r_{500} (~ 0.6 times r_{200}, the virial radius). An alternate,
two-component SN Ia model (including both prompt and delayed detonations)
produces a similar BCG+ICS contribution of 22^{+9}_{-9}%. Because the ICS
typically contribute 80% of the BCG+ICS Fe, we conclude that the ICS are
significant, yet often neglected, contributors to the ICM Fe within r_{500}.
However, the BCG+ICS fall short of producing all the Fe, so metal loss from
stars in other cluster galaxies must also contribute. By combining the
enrichment from intracluster and galactic stars, we can account for all the
observed Fe. These models require a galactic metal loss fraction
(0.84^{+0.11}_{-0.14}) that, while large, is consistent with the metal mass not
retained by galactic stars. The SN Ia rates, especially as a function of galaxy
environment and redshift, remain a significant source of uncertainty in further
constraining the metal loss fraction. For example, increasing the SN Ia rate by
a factor of 1.8 -- to just within the 2 sigma uncertainty for present-day
cluster early-type galaxies -- allows the combined BCG + ICS + cluster galaxy
model to generate all the ICM Fe with a much lower galactic metal loss fraction
(~ 0.35).

consequences are discussed, including the need for a fundamental scale far
above the weak scale to adequately suppress flavor-changing neutral currents.

warped compactification and supersymmetry. In warped compactifications and
""Flavorful Supersymmetry,"" where non-trivial flavor structure appears in the
new TeV physics, Dirac neutrinos are strongly favored over Majorana by lepton
flavor violation tests. We argue that this is part of a more general result for
flavor-sensitive TeV-scale physics. Our scenario strongly suggests that the
supersymmetric flavor problem is not solved locally in the extra dimension, but
rather at or below the compactification scale. In the supersymmetric Dirac

principle, the PDF allows a statistical detection of substructure, even if
individual halos cannot be detected. It may also allow detection of
substructure on the smallest microhalo mass scales, $\sim M_\oplus$, for
weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Furthermore, it may also provide
a method to measure the substructure mass function. However, an analysis that
assumes a typical halo substructure model and a conservative estimate of the
diffuse background suggests that the substructure PDF may not be detectable in
the lifespan of Fermi in the specific case that the WIMP is a neutralino.
Nevertheless, for a large range of substructure, WIMP annihilation, and diffuse
background models, PDF analysis may provide a clear signature of substructure.

the flares expected to arise when a star is disrupted by a supermassive black
hole. We present a simple analytic model relating the lightcurve to the
internal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard
lightcurve proportional to $t^{-5/3}$ only holds at late times. Close to the
peak luminosity the lightcurve is shallower, deviating more strongly from
$t^{-5/3}$ for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar--type) stars. We test
our model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar
models, described by simple polytropic spheres with index $\gamma$. The
simulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First,
the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective
reduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well
described by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the
polytropic index becomes larger. Second, for large polytropic indices wings
appear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material
is pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In
all our simulations, the $t^{-5/3}$ lightcurve is achieved only at late stages.
In particular we predict that for solar type stars, this happens only after the
luminosity has dropped by at least two magnitudes from the peak. We discuss our
results in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescent
galaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, such
as the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.

The spatial and kinematical distributions of the PNe agree with the field stars

with radius, though not very steeply, down to ~70 km/s at the last data point.

analyses with multi-component LCDM-motivated galaxies as well as logarithmic

we constrain using fourth-order velocity moments. Given several different sets

profile within the radial range constrained by the data. Some dark matter (DM)
is required by the data; our best-fit solution has a radially anisotropic

near-infrared spectral energy distributions in order to favor z~2 starburst
galaxies. The average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mJy. Our
analysis focuses on 29 sources in the Lockman Hole field where the average
1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mJy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mJy). The
analysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions
indicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities
~10^12-10^13.3 Lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 M_sun. Compared to
sub-millimeter selected galaxies (SMGs), the SWIRE-MAMBO sources are among
those with the largest 24um/millimeter flux ratios. The origin of such large
ratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and the
stacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the SWIRE-MAMBO sources
and of SMGs. The mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong PAH features, and a warm
dust continuum. The warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infrared
emission, and is likely associated with an AGN component. This constribution is
consistent with what is found in SMGs. The large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios are
thus not due to AGN emission, but rather to enhanced PAH emission compared to
SMGs. The analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dust
temperatures than typically observed in SMGs. Our selection favors warm
ultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarely
found in SMG samples. Our sample is the largest Spitzer-selected sample
detected at millimeter wavelengths currently available.

us to estimate the characteristic velocities of particles at several moments in

estimates of the velocities were also used. All these estimates are in
accordance with the same exponential decrease in velocity. The estimates of
time variations in the relative amount of ejected particles were based also on
results of the analysis of time variations in the size of the bright region of
ejected material. At te~10 s, the morphology of the ejecta (e.g. the location

observed material increased. Between 1 and 3 seconds after the impact and
between 8 and 60 seconds after the impact, more small bright particles were
ejected than expected from crater excavation alone. An outburst triggered by
the impact could cause such a difference. The sharp (by a factor of 1.6)
decrease in the rate of ejection at 55<te<72 s could be caused by a decrease in
the outburst that began at 10 s. Analysis of observations of the DI cloud and
of the outbursts from some comets testifies in favour of the proposition that
there can be large cavities, with material under gas pressure, below a
considerable fraction of a comet's surface. Internal gas pressure and material
in the cavities can produce natural and triggered outbursts and can cause

The method takes advantage of the Lax pair formulation for both linear and

relation that couples all known and unknown boundary values. Even though
additional technical complications arise in discrete problems compared to

a good choice. However, for gluon jets and in general for TeV scales, there are
significant benefits to be had from using larger radii, up to R\gtrsim 1. This

The proposed framework does not assume the availability of any prior channel
state information (CSI) and exploits only the one bit ACK/NACK feedback from
the legitimate receiver. Compared with earlier approaches, the main innovation
lies in the distribution of key bits among multiple ARQ frames. Interestingly,
this idea allows for achieving a positive secrecy rate even when the
eavesdropper experiences more favorable channel conditions, on average, than
the legitimate receiver. In the sequel, we characterize the information

with the dynamical influence of the structural features proper of the local

that superluminal propagation of electromagnetic wave is forbidden in a plasma

western limb of the Sun are associated with space weather effects such as solar
energetic particles (SEPs), shock or geo-effective ejecta at Earth. We focus on
the August 24, 2002 coronal mass ejection, a fast (~ 2000 km/s) eruption
originating from W81. Using a three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulation
of this ejection with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), we show how
a realistic initiation mechanism enables us to study the deflection of the CME
in the corona and the heliosphere. Reconnection of the erupting magnetic field
with that of neighboring streamers and active regions modify the solar
connectivity of the field lines connecting to Earth and can also partly explain
the deflection of the eruption during the first tens of minutes. Comparing the
results at 1 AU of our simulation with observations by the ACE spacecraft, we
find that the simulated shock does not reach Earth, but has a maximum angular
span of about 120$^\circ$, and reaches 35$^\circ$ West of Earth in 58 hours. We
find no significant deflection of the CME and its associated shock wave in the
heliosphere, and we discuss the consequences for the shock angular span.

We find that in the presence of pure qubit dephasing, photon population of the

inducing incoherent relaxation and excitation of the qubit. Measurement thus
induces both dephasing and mixing of the qubit, something that can reduce the

we show that this heat bath can induce quantum jumps in the qubit state and
reduce the achievable signal-to-noise ratio of a homodyne measurement of the

communities in social and information networks. We explore from a novel
perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in
large social and information networks, and we come to several striking
conclusions. We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning
problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural
properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as
communities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which
characterizes the ""best"" possible community--according to the conductance
measure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world
social and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more
refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been
appreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are
barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and
communities of larger size scales gradually ""blend into"" the expander-like core
of the network and thus become less ""community-like."" This behavior is not
explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network
generation models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would
expect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or
manifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as
testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found that a generative
graph model, in which new edges are added via an iterative ""forest fire""
burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community
profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets.

essentially 'bury' such signatures. Here we argue that we can actually isolate
the disk emission spectrum by using optical and near-infrared polarization of
quasars and uncover the important spectral signatures. In these quasars, the
polarization is considered to originate from electron scattering interior to
the BLR, so that the polarized flux shows the disk spectrum with all the
emissions from the BLR and torus eliminated. The polarized flux observations
have now revealed a Balmer edge feature in absorption and a blue near-infrared
spectral shape consistent with a specific and robust theoretical prediction.

simultaneously present: a principal one of 85.5 (+/-0.2) days, and a secondary
one of 620 (+/-15) days, both sinusoidal in shape, and with semi-amplitudes
Delta(V)=0.41 and 0.20 mag, respectively. IRC-10443 turns out to be a M7III
star, with a mean heliocentric radial velocity -28 km/s and reddened by
E(B-V)=0.87, a third of which of circumstellar origin. The same 0.5 kpc
distance is derived from application of the appropriate period-luminosity
relations to both the principal and the secondary periods. The long secondary
period causes a sinusoidal variation in color of 0.13 mag semi-amplitude in
V-Ic, with IRC-10443 being bluest at maximum and reddest at minimum, and with
associated changes in effective temperature and radius of 85 K and 6%,
respectively. This behavior of colors argues in favor of a pulsation nature for
the still mysterious long secondary periods in AGB stars.

the model describes the interplay of wetting layer formation and lateral phase
separation, which leads to a characteristic domain size $\ell(t)$ in the
directions parallel to the confining walls that grows according to the
Lifshitz-Slyozov $t^{1/3}$ law with time $t$ after the quench. Near the
critical point of the model, the description is shown to be equivalent to the
standard treatments based on Ginzburg-Landau models. Unlike the latter, the
present treatment is reliable also at temperatures far below criticality, where
the correlation length in the bulk is only of the order of a lattice spacing,
and steep concentration variations may occur near the walls, invalidating the
gradient square approximation. A further merit is that the relation to the
interaction parameters in the bulk and at the walls is always transparent, and
the correct free energy at low temperatures is consistent with the time

approach proposed in this paper is to directly discretize the variational
description of the system's motion. The resulting optimization algorithm lets
the discrete solution directly inherit characteristic structural properties
from the continuous one like symmetries and integrals of the motion. We show
that the DMOC approach is equivalent to a finite difference discretization of
Hamilton's equations by a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta scheme and employ
this fact in order to give a proof of convergence.

may have been systematically underestimated by conventional observational
methods, we present a numerical hydrodynamics study of time-averaged disk
masses (<M_d>) around low-mass Class 0, Class I, and Class II objects. Mean
disk masses (\overline{M}_d}) are then calculated by weighting the
time-averaged disk masses according to the corresponding stellar masses using a
power-law weight function with a slope typical for the Kroupa initial mass
function of stars. Two distinct types of disks are considered: self-gravitating
disks, in which mass and angular momentum are redistributed exclusively by
gravitational torques, and viscous disks, in which both the gravitational and
viscous torques are at work. We find that self-gravitating disks have mean
masses that are slowly increasing along the sequence of stellar evolution
phases. More specifically, Class 0/I/II self-gravitating disks have mean masses
\overline{M}_d=0.09, 0.10, and 0.12 M_sun, respectively. Viscous disks have
similar mean masses (\overline{M}_d=0.10-0.11 M_sun) in the Class 0/I phases
but almost a factor of 2 lower mean mass in the Class II phase
(\overline{M}_d,CII=0.06 M_sun). In each evolution phase, time-averaged disk
masses show a large scatter around the mean value. Our obtained mean disk
masses are larger than those recently derived by Andrews & Williams and Brown

with subsequent relaxation and magnetic reconnection -- is one of the most
widely debated ideas of solar physics. We readdress the theory in the light of
developments in three-dimensional magnetic reconnection theory. It is known
that the integrated parallel electric field along field lines is the key
quantity determining the rate of reconnection, in contrast with the
two-dimensional case where the electric field itself is the important quantity.
We demonstrate that this difference becomes crucial for sufficiently complex
magnetic field structures.
  A numerical method is used to relax a braided magnetic field to an ideal
force-free equilibrium; that equilibrium is found to be smooth, with only
large- scale current structures. However, the equilibrium is shown to have a
highly filamentary integrated parallel current structure with extremely short
length- scales. An analytical model is developed to show that, in a coronal
situation, the length scales associated with the integrated parallel current
structures will rapidly decrease with increasing complexity, or degree of
braiding, of the magnetic field. Analysis shows the decrease in these length
scales will, for any finite resistivity, eventually become inconsistent with
the stability of a force- free field. Thus the inevitable consequence of the
magnetic braiding process is shown to be a loss of equilibrium of the coronal
field, probably via magnetic reconnection events.

effect measurements indicate that the electron conduction in the parent phase

evolution of the scientific communities or disciplines. The prevalence of
uncited papers or of highly-cited papers, with respect to the bulk of
publications, provides important clues as to the dynamics of scientific
research. Using 25 million papers and 600 million references from the Web of
Science over the 1900-2006 period, this paper proposes a simple model based on
a random selection process to explain the ""uncitedness"" phenomenon and its
decline in recent years. We show that the proportion of uncited papers is a
function of 1) the number of articles published in a given year (the competing
papers) and 2) the number of articles subsequently published (the citing
papers) and the number of references they contain. Using uncitedness as a
departure point, we demonstrate the utility of the stretched-exponential
function and a form of the Tsallis function to fit complete citation
distributions over the 20th century. As opposed to simple power-law fits, for
instance, both these approaches are shown to be empirically well-grounded and
robust enough to better understand citation dynamics at the aggregate level.
Based on an expansion of these models, on our new understanding of uncitedness
and on our large dataset, we are able provide clear quantitative evidence and
provisional explanations for an important shift in citation practices around
1960, unmatched in the 20th century. We also propose a revision of the
""citation classic"" category as a set of articles which is clearly
distinguishable from the rest of the field.

HVS) are thought to be stars unbound to the Milky Way that originate from the
gravitational interaction of stellar systems with the supermassive black hole
at the Galactic center. We examine the latest HVS compilation and find
peculiarities that are unexpected in this black hole-ejection scenario. For
example, a large fraction of HVS cluster around the constellation of Leo and
share a common travel time of $\sim 100$-200 Myr. Furthermore, their velocities
are not really extreme if, as suggested by recent galaxy formation models, the
Milky Way is embedded within a $2.5\times 10^{12} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ dark halo
with virial velocity of $\sim 220$ km/s. In this case, the escape velocity at
$\sim 50$ kpc would be $\sim 600$ km/s and very few HVS would be truly unbound.
We use numerical simulations to show that disrupting dwarf galaxies may
contribute halo stars with velocities up to and sometimes exceeding the nominal
escape speed of the system. These stars are arranged in a thinly-collimated
outgoing ``tidal tail'' stripped from the dwarf during its latest pericentric
passage. We speculate that some HVS may therefore be tidal debris from a dwarf
recently disrupted near the center of the Galaxy. In this interpretation, the
angular clustering of HVS results because from our perspective the tail is seen
nearly ``end on'', whereas the common travel time simply reflects the fact that
these stars were stripped simultaneously from the dwarf during a single
pericentric passage. This proposal is eminently falsifiable, since it makes a
number of predictions that are distinct from the black-hole ejection mechanism
and that should be testable with improved HVS datasets.

(NOAA 10969), obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope, are presented.
Difference imaging of white light continuum data reveals a white light
brightening, 2 min in duration, linked to a co-temporal and co-spatial C2.0
flare event. The flare kernel observed in the white light images has a diameter
of 300 km, thus rendering it below the resolution limit of most space-based
telescopes. Continuum emission is present only during the impulsive stage of
the flare, with the effects of chromospheric emission subsequently delayed by
approximately 2 min. The localized flare emission peaks at 300% above the
quiescent flux. This large, yet tightly confined, increase in emission is only
resolvable due to the high spatial resolution of the Swedish Solar Telescope.
An investigation of the line-of-sight magnetic field derived from simultaneous
MDI data shows that the continuum brightening is located very close to a
magnetic polarity inversion line. Additionally, an H-alpha flare ribbon is
directed along a region of rapid magnetic energy change, with the footpoints of
the ribbon remaining co-spatial with the observed white light brightening
throughout the duration of the flare. The observed flare parameters are
compared with current observations and theoretical models for M- and X-class
events and we determine the observed white-light emission is caused by
radiative back warming. We suggest that the creation of white-light emission is
a common feature of all solar flares.

dust distribution, dust grain model, scattering cross section, and the distance
of the source; they also take longer time than unscattered photons to reach the
observer. Using a cross-correlation method, we study the light curves of the
X-ray dust scattering halo of Cyg X-1, observed with the \textit{Chandra X-ray
Observatory}. Significant time lags are found between the light curves of the
point source and its halo. This time lag increases with the angular distance
from Cyg X-1, implying a dust concentration at a distance along the line of
sight (LOS) of 2.0 kpc $\times$ (0.876 $\pm$ 0.002) from the Earth. By fitting
the observed light curves of the halo at different radii with simulated light
curves, we obtain a width of $\mathit{\Delta L}=33_{-13}^{+18}$ pc of this dust
concentration. The origin of this dust concentration is still not clearly
known. The advantage of our method is that we need no assumption of scattering
cross section, dust grain model, or dust distribution along the LOS. Combining
the derived dust distribution from the cross-correlation study with the surface
brightness distribution of the halo, we conclude that the two commonly accepted
models of dust grain size distribution need to be modified significantly.

with the CMS detector is presented in the context of the early LHC data. The
aim is to establish an analysis strategy for inclusive production of the Higgs
boson decaying in WW* pairs in the context of the early LHC data. Higgs mass
region between 120-200 GeV, in which this signature was proposed as highly
sensitive, has been studied. The W decays into lnu are considered, where l
stands for e or mu. The final states are characterized by two, opposite-sign,
high transverse momentum leptons, missing energy, carried out by the undetected
neutrinos, and little jet activity. This study uses Monte Carlo (MC) events
with full detector simulation, including limited calibration and alignment
precision as expected at the LHC startup. Sets of sequential cuts are applied
to each of the three topologies, in order to isolate a signal which exceeds the
tt and continuum WW backgrounds. Alternatively, an artificial neural network
multi-variate analysis technique is used.

two-point functions is compared. The error of a representative set of
observables as a function of the number of Dirac matrix inversions is used as a
basis for comparison. To achieve an equivalent reduction in error, we
demonstrate that an increase in the number of dilution projectors on a single
noise source usually requires fewer inversions than the use of multiple noise
sources. This exploratory study was performed on 100 quenched gauge
configurations and will be applied to the calculation of low-lying hadron
spectra.
