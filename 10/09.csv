cosmological calculations is described. Methods: iCosmo is a software package
to perform interactive cosmological calculations for the low redshift universe.
Computing distance measures, the matter power spectrum, and the growth factor
is supported for any values of the cosmological parameters. It also computes
derived observed quantities for several cosmological probes such as cosmic
shear, baryon acoustic oscillations and type Ia supernovae. The associated
errors for these observables can be derived for customised surveys, or for
pre-set values corresponding to current or planned instruments. The code also
allows for the calculation of cosmological forecasts with Fisher matrices which
can be manipulated to combine different surveys and cosmological probes. The
code is written in the IDL language and thus benefits from the convenient
interactive features and scientific library available in this language. iCosmo
can also be used as an engine to perform cosmological calculations in batch
mode, and forms a convenient adaptive platform for the development of further
cosmological modules. With its extensive documentation, it may also serve as a
useful resource for teaching and for newcomers in the field of cosmology.
Results: The iCosmo package is described with various examples and command
sequences. The code is freely available with documentation at
http://www.icosmo.org, along with an interactive web interface and is part of
the Initiative for Cosmology, a common archive for cosmological resources.

accessible with the understanding of flavor effects. However, a definite
well-motivated model where such a link occurs was still lacking. Adjoint SU(5)
is a simple grand unified theory where neutrino masses are generated through
the Type I and Type III seesaw mechanisms, and the lepton asymmetry is
generated by the fermionic triplet responsible for the Type III seesaw. We
focus exclusively on the case of inverted hierarchy for neutrinos, and we show
that successful flavored leptogenesis in this theory strongly points towards
low-energy CP violation. Moreover, since the range of allowed masses for the
triplet is very restricted, we find that the discovery at the LHC of new states
present in the theory, together with proton decay and unification of gauge
couplings, can conspire to provide a hint in favor of leptogenesis.

during this peak epoch of cosmic star formation may suggest that gas accretion
through cold streams is likely to be the dominant mode by which most
star-forming galaxies at high redshift since major mergers can completely
disrupt the observed velocity fields. However poor spatial resolution and
sensitivity have hampered this interpretation, limiting the study to the
largest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally different
modes of assembly than more typical star forming galaxies. Here we report
observations of a typical star forming galaxy at z=3.07 with a linear
resolution of ~100 parsec. This spatial sampling is made possible by the
combination of gravitational lensing and laser guide star adaptive optics. We
find a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted
efficiently into stars, likely assembling a spheroidal bulge and disk similar

methods using piecewise linear polynomials for the Helmholtz equation with the
first order absorbing boundary condition in the two and three dimensions. It is
proved that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin methods are stable (hence
well-posed) without any mesh constraint. For each fixed wave number $k$,
optimal order (with respect to $h$) error estimate in the broken $H^1$-norm and
sub-optimal order estimate in the $L^2$-norm are derived without any mesh
constraint. The latter estimate improves to optimal order when the mesh size
$h$ is restricted to the preasymptotic regime (i.e., $k^2 h \gtrsim 1$).
Numerical experiments are also presented to gauge the theoretical result and to
numerically examine the pollution effect (with respect to $k$) in the error
bounds. The novelties of the proposed interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin
methods include: first, the methods penalize not only the jumps of the function
values across the element edges but also the jumps of the normal and tangential
derivatives; second, the penalty parameters are taken as complex numbers of
positive imaginary parts so essentially and practically no constraint is
imposed on the penalty parameters. Since the Helmholtz problem is a
non-Hermitian and indefinite linear problem, as expected, the crucial and the
most difficult part of the whole analysis is to establish the stability
estimates (i.e., a priori estimates) for the numerical solutions. To the end,
the cruxes of our analysis are to establish and to make use of a local version
of the Rellich identity (for the Laplacian) and to mimic the stability analysis
for the PDE solutions given in \cite{cummings00,Cummings_Feng06,hetmaniuk07}.

unusual case of interband-channel pairing superconductivity. Here we show that,
in the limit where the pairing occurs within the interband channel, several
surprising effects occur quite naturally and generally: different
density-of-states on the two bands lead to several unusual properties,
including a gap ratio which behaves inversely to the ratio of
density-of-states; the weak-coupling limit of the Eliashberg and the BCS
theory, commonly taken as equivalent, in fact predict qualitatively different
dependence of the $\Delta_{1}/\Delta_{2}$ and $\Delta/T_{c}$ ratios on coupling
constants. We show analytically that these effects follow directly from the
interband character of superconductivity. Our results show that in the
interband-only pairing model the maximal gap ratio is $\sqrt{N_{2}/N_{1}}$ as
strong-coupling effects act only to reduce this ratio. This suggests that if
the large experimentally reported gap ratios (up to a factor 2) are correct,
the pairing mechanism must include more intraband interaction than is usually
assumed.

noise source, we have investigated the insect response for different levels of

particular, the percentage of insects which react to the sub-threshold signal,
shows a non-monotonic behavior, characterized by the presence of a maximum, for
increasing levels of the noise intensity. This constructive interplay between
external noise and calling signal is the signature of the non-dynamical
stochastic resonance phenomenon. Finally, we describe the behavioral activation
statistics by a soft threshold model which shows stochastic resonance. We find
that the maximum of the ensemble average of the input-output cross-correlation

two years after the SN it was detected in the radio, showing a rising radio
flux with an optically thin spectral slope, and it also displayed a large X-ray

then, mildly) relativistic jet pointing away from us. About 3 years after its
discovery the optical spectrum of SN 2001em showed a broad H-alpha line, and it
was therefore reclassified as Type IIn. Here we constrain its proper motion and
expansion velocity by analyzing four epochs of VLBI observations, extending out
to 5.4 years after the SN. The supernova is still unresolved 5.4 years after
the explosion. For the proper motion we obtain (23,000 +/- 30,000) km/s while
our 2-sigma upper limit on the expansion velocity is 6000 km/s. These limits
are somewhat tighter than those derived by Bietenholz & Bartel, and confirm
their conclusion that late time emission from SN 2001em, a few years after the
explosion, is not driven by a relativistic jet. VLA observations of the radio
flux density, at 8.46 GHz, show a decay as t^{-1.23 +/- 0.40} starting ~2.7
years after the SN. Collectively, the observations suggest interaction of the
SN ejecta with a very dense circumstellar medium, though the implied opacity

Perhaps the most popular instance, due to the widespread adoption of the
Semantic Web, is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). One of the primary
purposes of a knowledge network is to reason; that is, to alter the topology of
the network according to an algorithm that uses the existing topological
structure as its input. There exist many such reasoning algorithms. With
respect to the Semantic Web, the bivalent, monotonic reasoners of the RDF
Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are the most prevalent.
However, nothing prevents other forms of reasoning from existing in the
Semantic Web. This article presents a non-bivalent, non-monotonic, evidential
logic and reasoner that is an algebraic ring over a multi-relational network
equipped with two binary operations that can be composed to execute various
forms of inference. Given its multi-relational grounding, it is possible to use
the presented evidential framework as another method for structuring knowledge
and reasoning in the Semantic Web. The benefits of this framework are that it
works with arbitrary, partial, and contradictory knowledge while, at the same
time, it supports a tractable approximate reasoning process.

groups and their Lie algebras is played by their non-trivial second cohomology
classes which give rise to their central extensions (the affine Kac-Moody
groups and Lie algebras). Loop groups embed into the group GL_\infty of
continuous automorphisms of C((t)), and these classes come from a second
cohomology class of GL_\infty. In a similar way, double loop groups embed into
a group of automorphisms of C((t))((s)), denoted by GL_{\infty,\infty}, which
has a non-trivial third cohomology. In this paper we explain how to realize a
third cohomology class in representation theory of a group: it naturally arises
when we consider representations on categories rather than vector spaces. We
call them ""gerbal representations."" We then construct a gerbal representation
of GL_{\infty,\infty} (and hence of double loop groups), realizing its
non-trivial third cohomology class, on a category of modules over an
infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This is a two-dimensional analogue of
the fermionic Fock representations of the ordinary loop groups.

excitations of electroweak charged gauge bosons in the framework of the
Standard Model (SM) fields propagating in the bulk of a warped extra dimension.
Such a scenario can solve both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problems of
the SM. There are two such charged states in this scenario with couplings to
light quarks and leptons being suppressed relative to those in the SM, whereas
the couplings to top/bottom quarks are enhanced, similar to the case of
electroweak neutral gauge bosons previously studied. However, unlike the case
of electroweak neutral gauge bosons, there is no irreducible QCD background
(including pollution from possibly degenerate KK gluons) for decays to top +
bottom final state so that this channel is useful for the discovery of the
charged states. Moreover, decays of electroweak charged gauge bosons to
longitudinal W, Z and Higgs are enhanced just as for the neutral bosons.
However, unlike for the neutral gauge bosons, the purely leptonic (and hence
clean) decay mode of the WZ are fully reconstructible so that the ratio of the
signal to the SM (electroweak) background can potentially be enhanced by
restricting to the resonance region more efficiently. We show that such final
states can give sensitivity to 2 (3) TeV masses with an integrated luminosity
of 100 (300) inverse fb. We emphasize that improvements in discriminating a
QCD-jet from a highly boosted hadronically decaying W, and a highly boosted
top-jet from a bottom-jet will enhance the reach for these KK particles, and
that the signals we study for the warped extra dimensional model might actually
be applicable also to a wider class of non-supersymmetric models of electroweak
symmetry breaking.

from the mathematical point of view. On the other hand we show empirically that
the clustered phase of these problems is extremely hard from the algorithmic

Such scenarios allow a significant enhancement of the annihilation cross
section in the galactic halo relative to its value at freeze-out, particularly
when the mediator is light enough for this process to proceed through radiative
capture to a metastable `WIMP-onium' bound state. For MeV-scale vector
mediators charged under a hidden U(1)' gauge group, the enhanced annihilation
rate leads predominantly to a sizable excess positron flux, even in the absence
of astrophysical boost factors.

NGC 1600, a luminous elliptical in a galaxy group to study its star cluster
system. The images were obtained with the Optical Imager at the SOAR telescope.
The sample selection incompleteness was assessed as a function of magnitude and
image background level. Source counts were measured for different elliptical
annuli from the centre of NGC 1600, background subtracted, and fitted with a
Gaussian function. Colour distributions were derived as a function of
galactocentric distance for sources measured successfully in both filters.
Typical ages and metallicities were estimated based on single stellar
population models. A clear excess of point sources around NGC 1600 was found in
relation to the nearby field. The source counts were consistent with a Gaussian
distribution typical of other luminous ellipticals. The luminosity function
fits provided an estimate of the density of clusters at the different annuli
that could be integrated in solid angle, resulting in an estimated total
population of N_{GC} ~ 2850 star clusters. This yielded a specific frequency of
S_N ~ 1.6. The colour distributions show a hint of bimodality, especially at ~
20 kpc from the centre. Clusters in this region may be associated with a ring
or shell perturbation. Finally, the star cluster candidates were
cross-correlated to discrete X-ray sources and a coincidence rate of ~ 40% was
found. These are likely to be globular clusters harboring low-mass X-ray
binaries.

line-of-sight components that increase with angular distance from the dSph
centers, inducing detectable gradients in stellar redshift. In the absence of
an intrinsic velocity gradient (e.g., due to rotation or streaming), an
observed gradient in the heliocentric rest frame (HRF) relates simply to a
dSph's systemic proper motion (PM). Kinematic samples for the Milky Way's
brightest dSph satellites are now sufficiently large that we can use stellar
redshifts to constrain systemic PMs independently of astrometric data. Data
from our Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) Survey reveal significant HRF
velocity gradients in Carina, Fornax and Sculptor, and no significant gradient
in Sextans. Assuming there are no intrinsic gradients, the data provide a
relatively tight constraint on the PM of Fornax,
(mu_{alpha}^{HRF},mu_{delta}^{HRF})=(+48 +/- 15,-25 +/- 14) mas/century, that
agrees with published HST astrometric measurements. Smaller data sets yield
weaker constraints in the remaining galaxies, but our Carina measurement,

Galactic clusters. Catalogs and photometric samples currently available cover
most of the cluster mass range. The expectations of relatively long cluster
disruption timescales in the Clouds have been confirmed, allowing reliable
assessments of the cluster initial mass function and of the cluster formation
rate in the Clouds. Due to their proximity to the Galaxy, Magellanic clusters
are also well resolved into stars. Analysis of colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
of clusters with different ages, masses and metallicities are useful tools to
test dynamical effects such as mass loss due to stellar evolution, two-body
relaxation, stellar evaporation, cluster interactions and tidal effects. The
existence of massive and young Magellanic clusters has provided insight into
the physics of cluster formation. The magnitudes and colours of different
stellar types are confronted with stellar evolutionary tracks, thus
constraining processes such as convective overshooting, stellar mass-loss,
rotation and pre main-sequence evolution. Finally, the Magellanic cluster
system may contribute with nearby and well studied counterparts of the recently
proposed types of extragalactic clusters, such as Faint Fuzzies and Diffuse

challenges of analyzing the Suzaku data, i.e., improving the aspect correction
beyond that of the existing tools, and quantitatively assessing pileup. All of
our Suzaku observations (one, by design) occurred at or very near orbital phase
0 (superior conjunction), and hence show evolution in color-color diagrams due
to X-ray absorption by material from the wind of the secondary. We present
simple partial absorption models for this evolution. We then compare the Suzaku
and RXTE data, and explicitly divide the Fe line region into narrow and broad
components. Both are required for the Suzaku data, and are seen to be
consistent with the RXTE data. These Suzaku observations occurred near
historically hard, low flux states. We present fits of the broad band spectra
with a simple phenomenological broken powerlaw model, as well as a more
physically motivated Comptonization model. Whereas the former class of models
described nearly all of the RXTE campaign better than any physical model, here
the latter model is slightly more successful. The Comptonization model,
however, exhibits little evidence for a soft disk component, which formally
corresponds to a small, inner disk radius. Whether this is physical, due to
unmodeled absorption, or is a calibration issue, remains an open question.

friction. We consider the accretion of gas onto the SMBH from the surrounding
ISM and estimate the X-ray luminosity of the SMBH. We find that it can be
larger than 3x 10^39 erg^-1 or the typical X-ray luminosity of ultra-luminous
X-ray sources, when the SMBH passes the galactic disk. In particular, the
luminosity could exceed ~10^46 erg s^-1, if the SMBH is ejected into the
galactic disk. The average luminosity gradually increases as the SMBH spirals
into the galactic center. We also estimate the probability of finding recoiling
SMBHs with X-ray luminosities of >3x 10^39 erg^-1 in a disk galaxy.

number of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues where
conflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. The
spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwards
and, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is $\gamma \equiv

recently claimed $\rho \propto r^{-1.2}$ are clearly ruled out. The radial
dependence of $\gamma$ is well approximated by a power-law, $\gamma \propto
r^{\alpha}$ (the Einasto profile). The shape parameter, $\alpha$, varies
slightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profiles
of $\Lambda$CDM halos are not strictly universal: different halos cannot, in
general, be rescaled to look identical. Departures from similarity are also
seen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in density
profiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averaged
pseudo-phase-space density, $\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-1.875}$. Our conclusions
are reliable down to radii below 0.4% of the virial radius, providing
well-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects are
neglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which the
modifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can be
judged.

are important, the mass spectrum sets the slope of the eccentricity and

pulsars (such as Geminga and B0656+14). The signal from nearby pulsars is
expected to generate a small but significant dipole anisotropy in the cosmic

stellar structure models predict smaller radii and higher effective
temperatures than observed, but the number of systems with detailed analyses is
still small. In this paper we present a complete reanalysis of one of such
eclipsing systems, CM Dra, composed of two dM4.5 stars. New and existing light
curves as well as a radial velocity curve are modeled to measure the physical
properties of both components. The masses and radii determined for the
components of CM Dra are M1=0.2310+/-0.0009 Msun, M2=0.2141+/-0.0010 Msun,
R1=0.2534+/-0.0019 Rsun, and R2=0.2396+/-0.0015 Rsun. With relative
uncertainties well below the 1% level, these values constitute the most
accurate properties to date for fully convective stars. This makes CM Dra a
valuable benchmark for testing theoretical models. In comparing our
measurements with theory, we confirm the discrepancies reported previously for
other low-mass eclipsing binaries. These discrepancies seem likely to be due to
the effects of magnetic activity. We find that the orbit of this system is
slightly eccentric, and we have made use of eclipse timings spanning three
decades to infer the apsidal motion and other related properties.

it tracks the surface, generating wrinkles and releasing the pressure inside.
Apparently, the texture of the surface during the burst becomes smoother as the
viscosity increases. During the burst the surface breaks and generates several
small bubbles. Furthermore, the pressure inside the balloon is higher than the
external pressure before the burst; once the balloon tears the pressure is
released and the generated bubbles pulsate several times (see e.g. Brennen,

this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod. In this work, a
comparison of the flow around a spinning disk for a Newtonian and a

fluid emerges from the disk. The toroidal vortices that appear on top of the

length which is defined with respect to the level of the mean height of the

boundary plane is shifted towards the bulk of the fluid, which implies a
negative effective slip length. The analysis of the wall shear stress indicates
that a flow circulation is developed in the grooves of the rough surface
provided that the local boundary condition is no-slip. By applying a local slip
boundary condition, the center of the vortex is displaced towards the bottom
the grooves and the effective slip length increases. When the intrinsic slip
length is larger than the corrugation amplitude, the flow streamlines near the
surface are deformed to follow the boundary curvature, the vortex vanishes, and
the effective slip length saturates to a constant value. Inertial effects
promote vortex flow formation in the grooves and reduce the effective slip

is done using exact expressions for eigenvalue probability densities in terms
of generalized hypergeometric functions, and using the interpretation of the
latter as a Green function in the Dyson Brownian motion model. For the shifted

use exact expressions for the correlation functions in terms of classical

to linear response experiments, such as Bragg spectroscopy, which are only
sensitive to fluctuations in the particle-hole channel (spin or charge). For
Bosonic systems we find a sharp peak in the noise correlation at opposite

use Bogoliubov theory to study its temperature dependence. Interestingly we
find that it is enhanced with temperature in the low temperature limit. In one

peak in the noise correlations also broadens to a power-law singularity.

temperature for the samples studied in this work, as evidenced from the

obtained by coupling anti-de Sitter gravity to a Maxwell field and charged
scalar. We review our earlier analysis of this theory and extend it in two
directions. First, we consider all values for the charge of the scalar field.
Away from the large charge limit, backreaction on the spacetime metric is
important. While the qualitative behaviour of the dual superconductor is found
to be similar for all charges, in the limit of arbitrarily small charge a new
type of black hole instability is found. We go on to add a perpendicular
magnetic field B and obtain the London equation and magnetic penetration depth.
We show that these holographic superconductors are Type II, i.e., starting in a
normal phase at large B and low temperatures, they develop superconducting
droplets as B is reduced.

current and resistance, to a d.c. voltage. We have performed a quantitative
analysis by micromagnetics, including the spin transfer torque terms considered
usually, of this situation. The signals found from the spin transfer torque
effect are several orders of magnitude below the experimental values, even if a
static inhomogeneity of magnetization (the so-called ripple) is taken into
account. On the other hand, the presence of a small non-zero average Oersted
field is shown to be consistent with the full set of experimental results, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We examine, quantitatively, several sources
for this average field and point to the contacts to the sample as a likely
origin.

Planet Search data to the orbital parameters of extrasolar planets. To do so,
we have developed new tools for the automatic analysis of large-scale
simulations of Doppler velocity planet search data. One of these tools is the
2-Dimensional Keplerian Lomb-Scargle periodogram, that enables the
straightforward detection of exoplanets with high eccentricities (something the
standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram routinely fails to do). We used this
technique to re-determine the orbital parameters of HD20782b, with one of the
highest known exoplanet eccentricities (e=0.97+/-0.01). We also derive a set of
detection criteria that do not depend on the distribution functions of fitted
Keplerian orbital parameters (which we show are non-Gaussian with pronounced,
extended wings). Using these tools, we examine the selection functions in
orbital period, eccentricity and planet mass of Anglo-Australian Planet Search
data for three planets with large-scale Monte Carlo-like simulations. We find
that the detectability of exoplanets declines at high eccentricities. However,
we also find that exoplanet detectability is a strong function of
epoch-to-epoch data quality, number of observations, and period sampling. This
strongly suggests that simple parametrisations of the detectability of
exoplanets based on ""whole-of-survey"" metrics may not be accurate. We have
derived empirical relationships between the uncertainty estimates for orbital
parameters that are derived from least-squares Keplerian fits to our
simulations, and the true 99% limits for the errors in those parameters, which
are larger than equivalent Gaussian limits by factors of 5-10. (abridged)

  We found that at temperatures 25--30 K gas-phase abundances of H$_2$O,
NH$_3$, CO and many other gas-phase and surface species in the stochastic model
differ from those in the deterministic models by more than an order of
magnitude, at least, when tunneling is accounted for and/or diffusion energies

involving light species, proceed faster than accretion of the same species. In
contrast, in the model without tunneling and with high binding energies, when
the typical timescale of a surface recombination is greater than the timescale
of accretion onto the grain, we obtain almost perfect agreement between results
of Monte Carlo and deterministic calculations in the same temperature range. At
lower temperatures ($\sim10$ K) gaseous and, in particular, surface abundances
of most important molecules are not much affected by stochastic processes.

the coincidence of this source with both the shell-type supernova remnant (SNR)

gamma-rays from interaction of the old SNR with the GMC. Alternatively, the TeV
emission has been attributed to inverse Compton scattering from leptons
deposited by PSR J1833-0827, a pulsar assumed to have been born in W41 but now
located 24' from the center of the SNR (and the TeV source). Instead, we argue
for a third possibility, that the TeV emission is powered by a previously
unknown pulsar wind nebula located near the center of W41. The candidate pulsar
is XMMU J183435.3-084443, a hard X-ray point source that lacks an optical
counterpart to R>21 and is coincident with diffuse X-ray emission. The X-rays
from both the point source and diffuse feature are evidently non-thermal and
highly absorbed. A best fit power-law model yields photon index Gamma ~ 0.2 and
Gamma ~ 1.9, for the point source and diffuse emission, respectively, and 2-10

was employed to estimate the frequency of secondary transmissions relative to
disease-age. A likelihood-based procedure was taken using observed
distributions of the serial interval (n = 177) and incubation period (n = 126).
Furthermore, an extended model was developed to account for the survival
probability of cases. Results: The simple backcalculation suggested that 31.0%
(95% confidence intervals (CI): 11.6, 50.4) and 28.0 % (95% CI: 10.2, 45.8) of
the total number of secondary transmissions had occurred at second and third
days of the disease, respectively, and more than four-fifths of the secondary
transmission occurred before the end of third day of disease. The
survivorship-adjusted frequency of secondary transmissions was obtained,
demonstrating that the infectiousness in later stages of illness was not
insignificant and indicates that the obtained frequencies were likely biased on
underlying factors including isolation measures. Conclusion: The simple
exercise suggests a need to implement countermeasures during pre-clinical stage
or immediately after onset. Further information is needed to elucidate the
finer details of the disease-age specific infectiousness.

Iron pnictides is the latest example of unanticipated behavior exhibited by

mechanism of its emergence from the ``normal'' state is a central issue in this
context. Here, motivated by a host of experimental signatures suggesting strong
correlations in the Fe-pnictides, we undertake a detailed study of their normal
state. Focussing on symmetry-unbroken phases, we use the correlated band
structure method, LDA+DMFT, to study the one-particle responses of both ${\rm
LaO_{1-x}FeAsF_{x}}$ and ${\rm SmO_{1-x}FeAsF_{x}}$ in detail. Basing ourselves
on excellent quantitative agreement between LDA+DMFT and key experiments
probing the one-particle responses, we extend our study, undertaking the first
detailed study of their normal state electrodynamic response. In particular, we
propose that near-total normal state incoherence, resulting from strong, {\it
local} correlations in the Fe $d$-shell in Fe-pnictides, underpins the
incoherent normal state transport found in these materials, and discuss the
specific electronic mechanisms leading to such behavior. We also discuss the
implications of our work for the multi-band nature of the SC by studying the
pairing ``glue'' function, which we find to be an overdamped, electronic
continuum. Similarities and differences between cuprates and Fe-pnictides are

Beta Cep type and show a tendency to instability of high-order gravity modes,
especially for stellar models built with the OP opacities. However, instability
at observed long periods has not been achieved. We test effects of artificial
opacity modifications in the deep envelope on the instability of some hybrid
star models. For Nu Eri models, an opacity increase both in the Z opacity bump
region at temperature of about 200 000 K and in the region of the deeper
opacity bump at temperature of about 2-2.5 million degrees (this bump is also
mainly due to excited ions of the iron-group elements) may result in
instability of the high-order gravity modes with the observed periods. The
shortest observed period of 3 hours can also be excited in modified models.
However, the required opacity increase seems to be quite large (up to 2 times
in some stellar layers) which may be incompatible with atomic physics.

via loop corrections and depends on the ambient conditions while inflation was

progress while the universe was inflating, provided they were sufficiently
dramatic to overcome suppression by powers of (H/MP)^2 ~ 10^(-9), where H is
the Hubble scale during inflation and MP is the Planck mass. As an example, if
a primordial magnetic field was synthesized during inflation, as suggested by

variation in this coupling is mediated by interaction with a collection of
light scalar fields. If the mass scale associated with this interaction is too
far below the Planck scale then the stability of perturbation theory can be

security concerning secure multi-party computation, in practice it is hard to

we can apply the nonnegative Garrote, adaptive Lasso or hard-thresholding
procedure to obtain a final estimator that is both estimation and variable
selection consistent. Unlike the Lasso, our results do not require the
irrepresentable condition which could fail easily even for moderate $p_n$ (Zhao
and Yu, 2007) and it also allows $p_n$ to grow almost as fast as $\exp(n)$ (for
hard-thresholding there is no restriction on $p_n$). We also study the
conditions under which the Ridge regression can be used as an initial
estimator. We show that under a relaxed identifiable condition, the Ridge
estimator is $\ell_{\infty}$-consistent. Such a condition is usually satisfied
when $p_n\le n$ and does not require the partial orthogonality between relevant
and irrelevant covariates which is needed for the univariate regression in
(Huang et al., 2008). Our numerical studies show that when using the Lasso or
Ridge as initial estimator, the two-step procedures have a higher sparsity
recovery rate than the Lasso or adaptive Lasso with univariate regression used

from those found in more evolved Class I and Class II jets. We also infer that
only a fraction (0.05-0.2) of Fe and Si is in gaseous form, indicating that
dust still plays a major role in the depletion of refractory elements. A
comparison with the SiO abundance recently derived in the jet from an analysis
of several SiO sub-mm transitions, shows that the Si/SiO abundance ratio is
~100, and thus that most of the silicon released from grains by sputtering and
grain-grain collisions remains in atomic form. Finally, estimates of the atomic
and molecular mass flux rates have been derived: values of the order of
~10$^{-6}$ and ~10$^{-7}$ M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ are inferred from the
[SI]25$\mu$m and H$_2$ line luminosities, respectively. A comparison with the
momentum flux of the CO molecular outflow suggests that the detected atomic jet
has the power to drive the large scale outflow.

development and evaluation of efficient anomaly detection mechanisms.
Unfortunately, privacy concerns and data protection laws prevent network
operators from sharing these data. Anonymization is a promising solution in
this context; however, it is unclear if the sanitization of data preserves the
traffic characteristics or introduces artifacts that may falsify traffic
analysis results. In this paper, we examine the utility of anonymized flow
traces for anomaly detection. We quantitatively evaluate the impact of IP
address anonymization, namely variations of permutation and truncation, on the
detectability of large-scale anomalies. Specifically, we analyze three weeks of
un-sampled and non-anonymized network traces from a medium-sized backbone
network. We find that all anonymization techniques, except prefix-preserving
permutation, degrade the utility of data for anomaly detection. We show that
the degree of degradation depends to a large extent on the nature and mix of
anomalies present in a trace. Moreover, we present a case study that
illustrates how traffic characteristics of individual hosts are distorted by
anonymization.

Milky Way disk, using a sample of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood which is
representative for the entire solar circle. M stars are used because they show
H_alpha emission until a particular age which is a well calibrated function of
their absolute magnitudes. This allows us to reconstruct the rate at which disk
stars have been born over about half the disk's lifetime. Our star formation
rate agrees well with those obtained by using other, independent, methods and
seems to rule out a constant star formation rate.
  The principal result of this study is to show that a relation of the
Schmidt-Kennicut type (which relates the star formation rate to the
interstellar gas content of galaxy disks) has pertained in the Milky Way disk
during the last 5 Gyr. The star formation rate we derive from the M dwarfs and
the interstellar gas content of the disk can be inferred as a function of time
from a model of the chemical enrichment of the disk, which is well constrained
by the observations indicating that the metallicity of the Galactic disk has
remained nearly constant over the timescales involved. We demonstrate that the
star formation rate and gas surface densities over the last 5 Gyrs can be
accurately described by a Schmidt-Kennicutt law with an index of Gamma = 1.45
(+0.22,-0.09). This is, within statistical uncertainties, the same value found

connect and how the morphology changes with energy. Currently we find that two

observed by H.E.S.S. (if interpreted as IC radiation), while predicting the

Classical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \mathbb{CP}^k$ of the
support of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any
closed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition
of linking number between closed loops in $\mathbb{CP}^k \setminus \supp S$ and
the current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\gamma,S) \neq 0$, then
$\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\mathbb{CP}^k
\setminus \supp S)$.
  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many
classes of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with
infinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set
has infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of
$\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic
and has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew
product of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first
homology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a
section of concrete examples and questions for further study.

deformations of hyperkahler manifolds [arXiv:0806.4620] to the case of
quaternionic-Kahler manifolds. Via Swann's construction, deformations of a
4d-dimensional quaternionic-Kahler manifold $M$ are in one-to-one
correspondence with deformations of its $4d+4$-dimensional hyperkahler cone
$S$. The latter can be encoded in variations of the complex symplectomorphisms
which relate different locally flat patches of the twistor space $Z_S$, with a
suitable homogeneity condition that ensures that the hyperkahler cone property
is preserved. Equivalently, we show that the deformations of $M$ can be encoded
in variations of the complex contact transformations which relate different
locally flat patches of the twistor space $Z_M$ of $M$, by-passing the Swann
bundle and its twistor space. We specialize these general results to the case
of quaternionic-Kahler metrics with $d+1$ commuting isometries, obtainable by
the Legendre transform method, and linear deformations thereof. We illustrate
our methods for the hypermultiplet moduli space in string theory
compactifications at tree- and one-loop level.

LEggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source AGL
J1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar PKS 1510-089, during ten days
of observations from 23 August to 1 September 2007. During the observation
period, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitored
by the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope
(WEBT). The simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us to
study the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on the
synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission mechanisms. AGILE observed the
source with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector and the
hard X-ray imager Super-AGILE sensitive in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV and 18 - 60 keV
bands, respectively. Between 23 and 27 August 2007, AGILE detected gamma-ray
emission from PKS 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degrees
off-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}
for photon energy above 100 MeV. In the following period, 28 August - 1
September, after a satellite re-pointing, AGILE detected the source at about 35
degrees off-axis, with an average flux (E > 100 MeV) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}
photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-sigma
upper limit of 45 mCrab in 200 ksec. The spectral energy distribution is
modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission
plus contributions by external photons: the SSC emission contributes primarily
to the X-ray band, whereas the contribution of the IC from the external disc
and the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

viscous flow is analyzed. The body has geometrical constraints and its profile
would be found in the class of cubics which satisfy those conditions. The
optimal profile depends on the leading coefficient of these cubics and its
relation with the Reynolds number of the system is found. The solution to the
problem uses a method based on a suitable transformation rule for the cartesian

exact solutions using the Darmois matching conditions. In particular we focus
on the asymptotically velocity term dominated property (AVTD). We propose a
criterion that can be used to test if a spacetime constructed from a matching
can be considered AVTD. Using the Cheese Slice universe as an example, we show
that a spacetime constructed from a such a matching can inherit the AVTD
property from the original spacetimes. Furthermore the singularity resulting
from this particular matching is an AVTD singularity.

is added to published data to derive composite profiles over large dynamic
ranges. Sersic functions fit them remarkably well. Effective brightnesses and
radii are derived via Sersic fits and by integrating the profiles
nonparametrically. We strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) Elliptical galaxies
from cDs to M32 form a tight sequence in Fundamental Plane parameter space that
is almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from NGC 205 to
Draco. This is consistent with our understanding of their different formation
processes: mergers for Es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals
by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2)
Ellipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest Es have cuspy cores;
our 17 fainter Es do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in
coreless Es. All have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation
of the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made by starbursts
in dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. Three other new
aspects also point to an explanation of how the E-E dichotomy formed: extra
light Es were made in wet mergers while core Es were made in dry mergers. We
confirm that core Es do and extra light Es generally do not contain X-ray gas.
This suggests why the E-E dichotomy arose. Only core Es and their progenitors
are massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protect
old star populations from late star formation.

measurement of the muon-induced neutron flux in the Boulby Underground
Laboratory (North Yorkshire, UK), recently performed using a large scintillator
veto deployed around the ZEPLIN-II WIMP detector. Version 8.2 of the GEANT4
toolkit was used after relevant benchmarking and validation of neutron
production models. In the direct comparison between Monte Carlo and
experimental data, we find that the simulation produces a 1.8 times higher
neutron rate, which we interpret as over-production in lead by GEANT4. The
dominance of this material in neutron production allows us to estimate the
absolute neutron yield in lead as (1.31 +/- 0.06) x 10^(-3)
neutrons/muon/(g/cm^2) for a mean muon energy of 260 GeV. Simulated nuclear
recoils due to muon-induced neutrons in the ZEPLIN-II target volume (~1 year
exposure) showed that, although a small rate of events is expected from this
source of background in the energy range of interest for dark matter searches,
no event survives an anti-coincidence cut with the veto.
