survey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxy
clusters to high redshift. In this preliminary study, we focus on a 40
square-degree area targeted by the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), which is
centered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 degrees. Over two
seasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the SPT at 95
GHz, 150 GHz, and 225 GHz. We report the four most significant SPT detections
of SZ clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and,
therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an SZ survey.
The SZ clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigma
significance in the high-sensitivity 150 GHz SPT map. The SZ spectrum of these
sources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locations
in the 95 GHz SPT map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 GHz SPT
map. Multiband optical images from the BCS survey demonstrate significant
concentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the SZ
detections. Photometric redshift estimates from the BCS data indicate that two
of the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z
>~ 0.8). One of the SZ detections was previously identified as a galaxy cluster
using X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Potential RASS
counterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two of
the new discoveries. These first four galaxy clusters are the most significant
SZ detections from a subset of the ongoing SPT survey. As such, they serve as a
demonstration that SZ surveys, and the SPT in particular, can be an effective
means for finding galaxy clusters.

fragmentation of massive extended discs around Sun-like stars. Such discs
should arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because
they fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and
produce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and
very low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are
ejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these
stars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years
the Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and
two much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.
There is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs
tend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be
scattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a
few Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these
discs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the
newly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.
These binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries. BDs
that remain as companions to Sun-like stars are more likely to be in BD/BD
binaries than are BDs ejected into the field. Disc fragmentation is a robust
mechanism; even if only a small fraction of Sun-like stars host the required
massive extended discs,this mechanism can produce all the PM stars observed,
most of the BD stars, and a significant proportion of the very low-mass HB
stars.

non-linear systems have shown that the addition of external noise to systems
with an intrinsic noise may result in a less noisy response. Recently, the
possibility to reduce the diffusion noise in semiconductor bulk materials by
adding a random fluctuating contribution to the driving static electric field
has been tested. The present work extends the previous theories by considering
the noise-induced effects on the electron transport dynamics in low-doped
n-type GaAs samples driven by a high-frequency periodic electric field
(cyclostationary conditions). By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate
the changes in the spectral density of the electron velocity fluctuations
caused by the addition of an external correlated noise source. The results
reported in this paper confirm that, under specific conditions, the presence of
a fluctuating component added to an oscillating electric field can reduce the
total noise power. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear behaviour of the spectral
density with the noise intensity. Our study reveals that, critically depending
on the external noise correlation time, the dynamical response of electrons

  Meeting",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the case of spatially-revolved helioseismic data (such as MDI, GONG, HMI),
the usual mode-fitting analysis consists of fitting the 2l+1 individual
m-spectra of a given multiplet (n, l) either individually or simultaneously.
Such fitting methods fail to obtain reliable estimates of the mode parameters
(frequency, splitting, ...) when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, which
makes those methods not suitable when one wants to look at the low-amplitude,
long-lived solar p modes in the low-frequency range. Instead, Salabert et al.
(2007) developed a new method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting the
rotation- and structure-induced frequency shift for each m-spectrum to minimize
the mode width in the m-averaged spectrum (a ""collapsogram""). The m-averaged
spectrum technique, applied to the spatially-resolved GONG and MDI data,
appeared to be a powerful tool for low SNR modes in the low-frequency range.
Another possibility to increase the SNR is to combine data from different
instruments (Garcia et al. 2004a). We present here an adaptation of both
techniques: the ""collapsograms"" applied to a combination of observations from a
Sun-as-a-star instrument, GOLF, and a disk-imaged one, GONG.

An improved version of the Rouse model for a flexible polymer has been adopted
to mimic the molecular dynamics by taking into account both the interactions
between adjacent monomers and introducing a Lennard-Jones potential between all
beads. A bending recoil torque has also been included in our model. The polymer
dynamics is simulated in a two-dimensional domain by numerically solving the
Langevin equations of motion with a Gaussian uncorrelated noise. We find a
nonmonotonic behaviour of the mean first passage time and the most probable
translocation time, of the polymer centre of inertia, as a function of the

influence the motion of short polymers, by inducing two different regimes of

non-standard mixing event in their surface abundances of Li, C, and N, and in
their 12C/13C ratio. A Na overabundance has also been reported in some giants
of open clusters but remains controversial. The cause of the extra-mixing has
been attributed to thermohaline convection that should take place after the RGB
bump for low-mass stars and on the early-AGB for more massive objects. To track
the occurrence of this process over a wide mass range, we derive in a
homogeneous way the abundances of C, N, O, and Na, as well as the 12C/13C ratio
in a sample of 31 giants of 10 open clusters with turn-off masses from 1.7 to
3.1 Msun. A group of first ascent red giants with M/Msun \leq 2.5 exhibits
lower [N/C] ratios than those measured in clump giants of the same mass range,
suggesting an additional increase in the [N/C] ratio after the first dredge-up.
The sodium abundances corrected from NLTE are found to be about solar. [Na/Fe]
shows a slight increase of 0.10 dex as a function of stellar mass in the 1.8 to
3.2 Msun range covered by our sample, in agreement with standard first
dredge-up predictions. Our results do not support previous claims of sodium
overabundances as high as +0.60 dex. An anti-correlation between 12C/13C and
turn-off mass is identified and interpreted as being caused by a post-bump
thermohaline mixing. Moreover, we find low 12C/13C ratios in a few
intermediate-mass early-AGB stars, confirming that an extra-mixing process also
operates in stars that do not experienced the RGB bump. In this case, the
extra-mixing possibly acts on the early-AGB, in agreement with theoretical
expectations for thermohaline mixing. [abridged]

remains evasive and they are needed to really improve our knowledge of the

around 1e7 Msun within 300 pc (M03), while they span almost four order of
magnitudes in luminosity (Mateo et al. 1993, Strigari et al. 2008). It is
argued that this may reflect a specific scale for galaxy formation or a scale
for dark matter clustering. Here we use numerical simulations coupled with a
semi-analytic model for galaxy formation, to predict the central mass and
luminosity of galactic satellites in the LCDM model. We show that this common
mass scale can be explained within the Cold Dark Matter scenario when the
physics of galaxy formation is taken into account. The narrow range of M03
comes from the narrow distribution of circular velocities at time of accretion
(peaking around 20 km/s) for satellites able to form stars and the not tight
correlation between halo concentration and circular velocity. The wide range of
satellite luminosities is due to a combination of the mass at time of accretion
and the broad distribution of accretion redshifts for a given mass. This causes
the satellites baryonic content to be suppressed by photo-ionization to very
different extents. Our results favor the argument that the common mass M03
reflects a specific scale (circular velocity ~ 20 km/s) for star formation.

Intra-flow linear network coding is shown to achieve a larger rate region than
the case without coding. A traffic pattern is presented which is achievable
with coding but requires a switch speedup when coding is not allowed. The rate
region with coding can be characterized in a simple graph-theoretic manner, in
terms of the stable set polytope of the ""enhanced conflict graph"". No such
graph-theoretic characterization is known for the case of fanout splitting
without coding.
  The minimum speedup needed to achieve 100% throughput with coding is shown to
be upper bounded by the imperfection ratio of the enhanced conflict graph. When
applied to KxN switches with unicasts and broadcasts only, this gives a bound
of min{(2K-1)/K,2N/(N+1)} on the speedup. This shows that speedup, which is
usually implemented in hardware, can often be substituted by network coding,
which can be done in software.
  Computing an offline schedule (using prior knowledge of the flow rates) is
reduced to fractional weighted graph coloring. A graph-theoretic online
scheduling algorithm (using only queue occupancy information) is also proposed,
that stabilizes the queues for all rates within the rate region.

galactic disks show a characteristic floor in galaxies with low star formation
rates and within individual galaxies the dispersion profiles decline with
radius. We carry out several high resolution adaptive mesh simulations of
gaseous disks embedded within dark matter haloes to explore the roles of
cooling, star-formation, feedback, shearing motions and baryon fraction in
driving turbulent motions. In all simulations the disk slowly cools until
gravitational and thermal instabilities give rise to a multi-phase medium in
which a large population of dense self-gravitating cold clouds are embedded
within a warm gaseous phase that forms through shock heating. The diffuse gas
is highly turbulent and is an outcome of large scale driving of global
non-axisymmetric modes as well as cloud-cloud tidal interactions and merging.
At low star-formation rates these processes alone can explain the observed HI
velocity dispersion profiles and the characteristic value of ~10 km/s observed
within a wide range of disk galaxies. Supernovae feedback creates a significant
hot gaseous phase and is an important driver of turbulence in galaxies with a
star-formation rate per unit area >10^-3 M_sun/yr/kpc^2.

  The observation that the structure of string theory is rich enough to include
the standard model in rough outline is an old one, starting with the early
constructions of free field constructions, orbifold theories, and in particular
Calabi-Yau compactifications in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the time
these constructions provided a large collection of different vacua, with
thousands of explicitly constructed Calabi-Yau manifolds, and estimates of vast
numbers of bosonic models, each one associated with its own moduli space. It
was clear even then that it would be impossible to systematically search this
string vacua landscape. This, however, is not a fundamental problem. Adopting
the point of view that any physical theory has to describe not only our
universe, but all possible consistent universes, leads to the obvious strategy
of using some phenomenological input to select viable models among the ocean of
models that obviously do not describe physics as we know it.

abundances of many ionic species and their isotopes. A long standing puzzle has
been the extreme enrichments of 3He ions. The most extreme enrichments are
observed in low fluence, the so-called impulsive, events which are believed to
be produced at the flare site in the solar corona with little scattering and
acceleration during transport to the Earth. In two earlier papers (Liu et al.
2004 and 2006) we showed how such extreme enrichments can result in the model
developed by Petrosian and Liu (2004), where ions are accelerated
stochastically by plasma waves or turbulence. In this paper we address the
relative distributions of the fluences of 3He and 4He ions presented by Ho et
al. (2005) which show that while the distribution of 4He fluence like many
other extensive characteristics of solar flare, is fairly broad, the 3He
fluence is limited to a narrow range. Moreover, the ratio of the fluences shows
a strong correlation with the 4He fluence. One of the predictions of our model
was presence of steep variation of the fluence ratio with the level of
turbulence or the rate of acceleration. We show here that this feature of the
model can reproduce the observed distribution of the fluences with very few
free parameters. The primary reason for the success of the model in both fronts
is because fully ionized 3He ion, with its unique charge to mass ratio, can
resonantly interact with more plasma modes and accelerate more readily than
4He. Essentially in most flares, all background 3He ions are accelerated to few
MeV/nucleon range, while this happens for 4He ions only in very strong events.
A much smaller fraction of 4He ions reach such energies in weaker events.

periodically, or according to some time-based schedule. Clearly, perfectly
synchronized devices could switch their radios on for exactly the minimum
periods required by their joint schedules. The main challenge in the deployment
of wireless networks is to synchronize the devices' schedules, given that their
initial schedules may be offset relative to one another (even if their clocks
run at the same speed). We significantly improve previous results, and show
optimal use of the radio for two processors and near-optimal use of the radio
for synchronization of an arbitrary number of processors. In particular, for
two processors we prove deterministically matching $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ upper and
lower bounds on the number of times the radio has to be on, where $n$ is the
discretized uncertainty period of the clock shift between the two processors.
(In contrast, all previous results for two processors are randomized.) For

evolution of populations, we found that fitness increases in punctuated steps
via epistatic events, leading to formation of stable and functionally
interacting proteins. At low mutation rates, species - populations of organisms
with identical genotypes - form, while at higher mutation rates, species are
lost through delocalization in sequence space without an apparent loss of
fitness. However, when mutation rate was a selectable trait, the population
initially maintained high mutation rate until a high fitness level is reached,
after which organisms with low mutation rates are gradually selected, with the
population eventually reaching mutation rates comparable to those of modern
DNA-based organisms. These results provide microscopic insights into the
dynamic fitness landscape of asexual populations of unicellular organisms.

While the emission processes operating in various spectral bands in blazars are
reasonably well understood, the knowledge of the details of the structure of
the jet, location of the dissipation region with respect to the accreting black
hole, and coupling of the jet to the accretion process are known only at a

next leap in DSL transmission rates. An important issue when implementing
crosstalk cancelation techniques in hardware is the effect of finite world
length on performance. In this paper we provide an analysis of the performance
of linear zero-forcing precoders, used for crosstalk compensation, in the
presence of finite word length errors. We quantify analytically the trade off
between precoder word length and transmission rate degradation. More
specifically, we prove a simple formula for the transmission rate loss as a
function of the number of bits used for precoding, the signal to noise ratio,
and the standard line parameters. We demonstrate, through simulations on real
lines, the accuracy of our estimates. Moreover, our results are stable in the
presence of channel estimation errors. Finally, we show how to use these
estimates as a design tool for DSL linear crosstalk precoders. For example, we
show that for standard VDSL2 precoded systems, 14 bits representation of the
precoder entries results in capacity loss below 1% for lines over 300m.

Cepheids are bluer in (B-V) at a given period than for both the Galaxy and the
LMC. Their P-C relation in (B-V) is best fit by two lines intersecting at P=10
d. Their break must necessarily exist also in the P-L relations in B and/or V,
but remains hidden in the magnitude scatter. An additional pronounced break of
the P-L relations in B, V, and I occurs at P=2.5 d. The observed slope of the
lines of constant period in the HR diagram agrees with the theoretical
expectation from the pulsation equation. The largest amplitude Cepheids for
periods less than 13 days occur near the blue edge of the instability strip.
The sense is reversed in the period interval from 13 to 20 days, as in the
Galaxy and the LMC. The SMC P-L relation is significantly flatter than that for
the Galaxy, NGC 3351, 4321, M31, all of which have nearly the same steep slope.
The SMC P-L slope is intermediate between that of these steep slope cases and
the very shallow slope of Cepheids in the lower metallicity galaxies of NGC
3109 and Sextans A/B, consistent with the premise that the Cepheid P-L relation
varies from galaxy-to-galaxy as function of metallicity. Failure to take into
account the slope differences in the P-L relation as a function of metallicity
using Cepheids as distance indicators results in incorrect Cepheid distances.
Part of the 15% difference between our long distance scale - now independently
supported by TRGB distances - and that of the HST Key Project short scale is
due to the effect of using an inappropriate P-L relation.

force for a scalar field under the influence of a delta-function potential that

making a perturbative expansion in the amplitude of the corrugation we find the
leading order for the corrugated concentric cylinders and the next-to-leading
order for the corrugated parallel plates.

dimensional system coupled to ferromagnets and/or superconductors. Our results
are valid for arbitrary temperatures with respect to the spin energy, but
require temperature be small compared to the charge energy. We focus mainly on
the spin-incoherent regime where temperature is large compared to the spin
energy, but small compared to the charge energy. In the case of a ferromagnet
we study spin pumping and the renormalized dynamics of a precessing magnetic
order parameter. We find the interaction-dependent temperature dependence of
the spin pumping can be qualitatively different in the spin-incoherent regime
from the Luttinger liquid regime, allowing an identification of the former.
Likewise, the temperature dependence of the renormlized magnetization dynamics
can be used to identify spin-incoherent physics. For the case of a
spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid coupled to two superconductors, we compute the
ac and dc Josephson current for a wire geometry in the limit of tunnel coupled
superconductors. Both the ac and dc response contain ""smoking gun"" signatures
that can be used to identify spin-incoherent behavior. Experimental
requirements for the observation of these effects are laid out.

at its output is a popular performance index. The SINR can be modeled as a

theory, if one assumes that the dimension of the received and transmitted
signals go to infinity at the same pace. This paper considers the asymptotic
behavior of the SINR for a wide class of multidimensional signal models that
includes general multi-antenna as well as spread spectrum transmission models.
  The expression of the deterministic approximation of the SINR in the large

converge in distribution to the Gaussian law in the large dimension regime, and
their variance is shown to decrease as the inverse of the signal dimension.

superconductor CeIrIn$_5$. Sensitive measurements of the Hall effect and
magnetoresistance (MR) are used to elucidate the low temperature phase diagram
of this system. The normal-state magnetotransport is highly anomalous, and
experimental signatures of a pseudogap-like precursor state to
superconductivity as well as evidence for two distinct scattering times
governing the Hall effect and the MR are observed. Our observations point out
the influence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the magnetotransport in this
class of materials. The implications of these findings, both in the context of
unconventional superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems as well as in
relation to the high temperature superconducting cuprates are discussed.

perturbation expansion to the fourth order in the on-site Coulomb repulsion U.
Numerically calculating all diagrams up to the fourth order in self-energy, we
examine the convergence of perturbation series in the lattice system. We
indicate that the coefficient of each order term rapidly decreases as in the
impurity Anderson model for T > 0.1t in the half-filled case, but it holds in
the doped case even at lower temperatures. Thus, we can expect that the
convergence of perturbation expansion in U is very good in a wide parameter
region also in the lattice system, except for T < 0.1t in the half-filled case.
We next calculate the density of states in the fourth-order perturbation. In
the half-filled case, the shape in a moderate correlation regime is quite
different from the three peak structure in the second-order perturbation.
Remarkable upper and lower Hubbard bands locate at w = +(-)U/2, and a pseudogap
appears at the Fermi level w=0. This is considered as the precursor of the
Mott-Hubbard antiferromagnetic structure. In the doped case, quasiparticles
with very heavy mass are formed at the Fermi level. Thus, we conclude that the
fourth-order perturbation theory overall well explain the asymptotic behaviors

a temperature dependence that is not simple power-law nor exponential. We show

presence of a pKa value that is perturbed by 2 or more pK units, and such
residues have been demonstrated to play critical roles in catalysis, ligand
binding, and protein stability. Within the HCV helicase and polymerase, as well
as the HIV reverse transcriptase, highly conserved regions were demonstrated to
possess a greater number and magnitude of perturbations than lesser conserved
regions, suggesting that there is an interrelationship present between protein
electrostatics and evolution.

it is not clear if these intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars are able to
drive a dynamo and ensuing phenomena of magnetic activity. Alternative X-ray
production mechanisms, related to stellar winds, star-disk magnetospheres, or
unresolved late-type T Tauri star companions have been proposed. In a series of
papers we have been investigating high-resolution X-ray Chandra images of
Herbig Ae/Be and main-sequence B-type stars to test the T Tauri hypothesis by
spatially resolving known visual companions from the primaries. Here we report
on six as yet unpublished Chandra exposures from our X-ray survey of Herbig
stars. The target list comprises six Herbig stars with known cool companions,
and three further A/B-type stars that are serendipitously in the Chandra
field-of-view. In this sample we record a detection rate of 100%, i.e. all
A/B-type stars display X-ray emission at levels of log(L_x/L_bol) ~ -5...-7.
The analysis of hardness ratios confirms that HAeBe's have hotter and/or more
absorbed X-ray emitting plasma than more evolved B-type stars. Radiative winds
are ruled out as exclusive emission mechanism on basis of the high X-ray
temperatures. Confirming earlier results, the X-ray properties of Herbig Ae/Be
stars are not vastly different from those of their late-type companion stars
(if such are known). The diagnostics provided by the presently available data
leave open if the hard X-ray emission of Herbig stars is due to young age or
indicative of further coronally active low-mass companion stars. In the latter
case, our detection statistics imply a high fraction of higher-order multiple
systems among Herbig stars.

processes are well described when assuming the fluid as a perfect conductor.
For these systems, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description captures
the dynamics effectively and a number of well-tested techniques exist for its
numerical solution. Yet, there are several astrophysical processes involving
magnetic fields which are highly dynamical and for which resistive effects can
play an important role. The numerical modeling of such non-ideal MHD flows is
significantly more challenging as the resistivity is expected to change of
several orders of magnitude across the flow and the equations are then either
of hyperbolic-parabolic nature or hyperbolic with stiff terms. We here present
a novel approach for the solution of these relativistic resistive MHD equations
exploiting the properties of implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta methods. By
examining a number of tests we illustrate the accuracy of our approach under a
variety of conditions and highlight its robustness when compared with
alternative methods, such as the Strang-splitting. Most importantly, we show
that our approach allows one to treat, within a unified framework, both those
regions of the flow which are fluid-pressure dominated (such as in the interior
of compact objects) and those which are instead magnetic-pressure dominated
(such as in their magnetospheres)

this class. Our analysis indicates that the best-fit model is a thermal
bremsstrahlung with an average temperature of <kT> ~22 keV. Recently, eleven
(ten intermediate polars and one polar) of these systems have been followed-up
by Swift/XRT (operating in the 0.3-10 keV energy band), thus allowing us to
investigate their spectral behaviour over the range ~0.3-100 keV. Thanks to
this wide energy coverage, it was possible for these sources to simultaneously
measure the soft and hard components and estimate their temperatures. The soft
emission, thought to originate in the irradiated poles of the white dwarf
atmosphere, is well described by a blackbody model with temperatures in the
range ~60-120 eV. The hard emission, which is supposed to be originated from
optically thin plasma in the post-shock region above the magnetic poles, is
indeed well modelled with a bremsstrahlung model with temperatures in the range
~16-33 keV, similar to the values obtained from the INTEGRAL data alone. In
several cases we also find the presence of a complex absorber: one totally
(with NH ~(0.4-28) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}) and one partially (with NH ~(0.7-9) x

that chaotic orbits region can be highly relevant, especially for very high

analytical theory which lead to a detailed understanding of the resonance

depends on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio through the H3+ fractionation. Aims. We
want to constrain the ortho/para H2 ratio across the L183 prestellar core. This
is mandatory to correctly describe the deuter- ation amplification phenomenon
in depleted cores such as L183 and to relate the total (ortho+para) H2D+
abundance to the sole ortho-H2D+ column density measurement. Methods. To
constrain this ortho/para H2 ratio and derive its profile, we make use of the
N2D+ /N2H+ ratio and of the ortho-H2D+ observations performed across the
prestellar core. We use two simple chemical models limited to an almost totally
depleted core description. New dissociative recombination and trihydrogen
cation-dihydrogen reaction rates (including all isotopologues) are presented in
this paper and included in our models. Results. We estimate the H2D+ ortho/para
ratio in the L183 cloud, and constrain the H2 ortho/para ratio : we show that
it is varying across the prestellar core by at least an order of magnitude
being still very high (~0.1) in most of the cloud. Our time-dependent model
indicates that the prestellar core is presumably older than 1.5-2 x 10^5 years
but that it may not be much older. We also show that it has reached its present
density only recently and that its contraction from a uniform density cloud can
be constrained. Conclusions. A proper understanding of deuteration chemistry
cannot be attained without taking into account the whole ortho/para family of
molecular hydrogen and trihydrogen cation isotopologues as their relations are
of utmost importance in the global scheme. Tracing the ortho/para H2 ratio
should also give useful constraints on the dynamical evolution of prestellar
cores.

stars at least an order of magnitude more massive than in the present-day case.
We here consider what controls the transition from a primordial to a modern
initial mass function. It has been proposed that this occurs when effective
metal line cooling occurs at a metallicity threshold of Z/Z_sun > 10^{-3.5}. We
study the influence of low levels of metal enrichment on the cooling and
collapse of initially ionized gas in small protogalactic halos using
three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with particle
splitting. Our initial conditions represent protogalaxies forming within a
previously ionized H ii region that has not yet had time to cool and recombine.
These differ considerably from those used in simulations predicting a
metallicity threshold, where the gas was initially cold and only partially
ionized. In the centrally condensed potential that we study here, a wide
variety of initial conditions for the gas yield a monolithic central collapse.
Our models show no fragmentation during collapse to number densities as high as
10^5 cm^{-3}, for metallicities reaching as high as 10^{-1} Z_sun in one
rotating case, far above the threshold suggested by previous work. Rotation
allows for the formation of gravitationally stable gas disks over large
fractions of the local Hubble time. Turbulence slows the growth of the central
density slightly, but both spherically symmetric and turbulent initial
conditions collapse and form a single sink particle. We therefore argue that
fragmentation at moderate density depends on the initial conditions for star
formation more than on the metal abundances present.

relation (so called Yonetoku relation) and $E_p$-isotropic energy ($E_{\rm

of the two relations although they have been considered similar and dependent.
  From this viewpoint, we compare constraints on cosmological parameters,
$\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, from the Yonetoku and Amati relations
calibrated by low-redshift GRBs with $z < 1.8$. We found that they are
different in 1-$\sigma$ level, although they are still consistent in 2-$\sigma$
level. This and the fact that both Amati and Yonetoku relations have systematic
errors larger than statistical errors suggest the existence of a hidden
parameter of GRBs. We introduce the luminosity time $T_L$ defined by $T_L\equiv
E_{\rm iso}/L_p$ as a hidden parameter to obtain a generalized Yonetoku
relation as $(L_p/{10^{52} \rm{erg s^{-1}}}) =
  10^{-3.88\pm0.09}(E_p/{\rm{keV}})^{1.84\pm0.04}
  (T_L/{\rm{s}})^{-0.34\pm0.04}$. The new relation has much smaller systematic
error, 30%, and can be regarded as ""Fundamental plane"" of GRBs. We show a
possible radiation model for this new relation. Finally we apply the new
relation for high-redshift GRBs with $1.8 < z < 5.6$ to obtain
$(\Omega_m,\Omega_{\Lambda}) =
  (0.16^{+0.04}_{-0.06},1.20^{+0.03}_{-0.09})$, which is consistent with the

which modifies the Yukawa couplings of matter fields relative to minimal SO(10)
predictions. We analyze the differences in the low energy phenomenology
compared to that of mSUGRA, assuming universal soft breaking scalar masses,
gaugino masses and trilinear couplings at the GUT scale. We find that thermal
neutralino Dark Matter remains viable in this scenario, although for small and
moderate values of $\tan\beta$ the allowed region is even more highly
constrained than in mSUGRA, and depends strongly on the the light neutrino

separation of the dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of
constituent spin and internal orbital angular momentum. The result is a
single-variable light-front Schrodinger equation for QCD which determines the
eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and
orbital angular momentum. This frame-independent light-front wave equation is
equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of
spin-$J$ modes on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. Light-front holography is a
remarkable feature of AdS/CFT: it allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth
dimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of
hadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of
hadrons at the amplitude level. In principle, the model can be systematically
improved by diagonalizing the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian on the AdS/QCD
basis. Quark and gluon hadronization can be computed at the amplitude level by
convoluting the off-shell $T$ matrix calculated from the QCD light-front
Hamiltonian with the hadronic light-front wavefunctions. We also note the
distinction between static observables such as the probability distributions
computed from the square of the light-front wavefunctions versus dynamical
observables such as the structure functions and the leading-twist single-spin
asymmetries measured in deep inelastic scattering which include the effects of
initial and final-state interactions.

function for propagation in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Others are
obtained by directly sampling an analytical impulse response in the

performance of each impulse response, a simulation test involving several
monopoles excited by non stationary signals is presented and some features are
proposed to assess the accuracy of the temporal signals resulting from
reconstruction processing on a forward plane. Then several inverse impulse
responses used to solve the inverse problem, which consists in back propagating
the acoustic signals acquired by the microphone array, are built directly from
a transfer function or by using Wiener inverse filtering from the direct
impulse responses obtained for the direct problem. Another simulation test is
performed to compare the signals reconstructed on the source plane. The same
indicators as for the propagation study are used to highlight the differences

Using an ensemble of very large dark matter LambdaCDM N-body simulations, we
compare internal error estimators (jackknife and bootstrap) to external ones
(Monte-Carlo realizations). For 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we find
that none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduce
neither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25
Mpc/h scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by
~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal
eigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the
correct variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller
scales. This scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered
eigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the external
estimates. Our results have important implications for the use of galaxy
clustering in placing constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, in a
2-parameter fit to the projected correlation function, we find that the
standard bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95% confidence interval,
while the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. The scatter
we find between realizations, for Gaussian statistics, implies that a 2-sigma
confidence interval, as inferred from an internal estimator, could correspond
in practice to anything from 1-sigma to 3-sigma. Finally, by an oversampling of
sub-volumes, it is possible to obtain bootstrap variances and confidence
intervals that agree with external error estimates, but it is not clear if this
prescription will work for a general case.

been a long standing goal because of potential applications^{1,2} and the
opportunity to study quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions^{3,4}. However,
this is a challenging target: in conventional metals the high electron density
restricts interface effects such as carrier depletion/accumulation to a region
much narrower than the coherence length, the scale necessary for
superconductivity to occur. In contrast, in copper oxides the carrier density
is low while the critical temperature (T_c) is high and the coherence length
very short; so, this provides a breakthrough opportunity but at a price: the
interface must be atomically perfect. Here we report on superconductivity in
bilayers consisting of an insulator (La_2CuO_4) and a metal
(La_{1.55}Sr_{0.45}CuO_{4}), neither of which is superconducting in isolation.
However, in bilayers T_c is either ~15 K or ~30 K, depending on the layering
sequence. This highly robust phenomenon is confined within 2-3 nm from the
interface. If such a bilayer is exposed to ozone, T_c exceeds 50 K and this
enhanced superconductivity is also shown to originate from the interface layer
about 1-2 unit cell thick. Enhancement of T_c in bilayer systems was observed
previously^5 but the essential role of the interface was not recognized at the
time. Our results demonstrate that engineering artificial heterostructures
provides a novel, unconventional way to fabricate stable, quasi two-dimensional
high T_c phases and to significantly enhance superconducting properties in

of relativistic wave equations. It is shown that the collection of
non-equivalent Galilei-invariant wave equations for massless fields with spin
equal 1 and 0 is very reach and corresponds to various contractions of the
representations of the Lorentz group to those of the Galilei one. It describes
many physically consistent systems, e.g., those of electromagnetic fields in
various media or Galilean Chern-Simon models. Finally, classification of all
linear and a big group of non-linear Galilei-invariant equations for massless
fields is presented.

present a large multi-epoch high resolution spectroscopic investigation for the
search of binary candidates in the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) M4. The aim
of our work is the identification of the binary candidates, and the
determination of the binary fraction and of the binary radial distribution. The
average radial velocity of the observed cluster members is
$70.29+/-0.07(+/-0.3)(+/-0.1)km/s. The search for variations in radial
velocities among the stars with multi-epoch observations yielded 57 binary star
candidates. Our radial velocity measurement accuracy allowed us to identify at
a 3sigma level binaries with radial velocity variations larger than ~0.3km/s
for the target stars with V<15, and larger than ~0.5km/s for the targets with
V>15. We identified 4 binary star candidates out of 97 observed targets inside
the core radius, and 53 candidates out of 2372 observed stars outside the core
radius. Accounting for the incompleteness affecting our survey, the lower limit
for the total binary fraction is f=3.0+/-0.3%. The lower limit for the binary
fraction in the cluster core is f=5.1+/-2.3%, while outside the core it
decreases to f=3.0+/-0.4%. Similarly, we found f=4.5+/-0.4% and f=1.8+/-0.6%
for the binary fraction inside and outside the half mass radius.

and it is expected that some of the lost material should remain within the
cluster as an intracluster medium (ICM). Most attempts to detect such an ICM
have been unsuccessful. The Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer on the
Spitzer Space Telescope was used to observe eight Galactic globular clusters in
an attempt to detect the thermal emission from ICM dust. Most clusters do not
have significant detections at 70 microns; one cluster, NGC 6341, has tentative
evidence for the presence of dust, but 90 micron observations do not confirm
the detection. Individual 70 micron point sources which appear in several of
the cluster images are likely to be background galaxies. The inferred dust mass
and upper limits are < 4e-4 solar masses, well below expectations for cluster
dust production from mass loss in red and asymptotic giant branch stars. This
implies that either globular cluster dust production is less efficient, or that
ICM removal or dust destruction is more efficient, than previously believed. We
explore several possibilities for ICM removal and conclude that present data do
not yet permit us to distinguish between them.

axisymmetric codes that accurately simulate the oscillations and gravitational
collapse of relativistic stars and to current 3D codes that provide pieces of a
binary black hole spacetime. Cauchy codes have now been successful at
simulating all aspects of the binary black hole problem inside an artificially
constructed outer boundary. A prime application of characteristic evolution is
to extend such simulations to null infinity where the waveform from the binary
inspiral and merger can be unambiguously computed. This has now been
accomplished by Cauchy-characteristic extraction, where data for the
characteristic evolution is supplied by Cauchy data on an extraction worldtube
inside the artificial outer boundary. The ultimate application of
characteristic evolution is to eliminate the role of this outer boundary by
constructing a global solution via Cauchy-characteristic matching. Progress in
this direction is discussed.

metamagnetic transitions has opened a rich vein of new physics in itinerant
electron systems, including the discovery of quantum critical end points with a
marked propensity to develop new kinds of order. However, the electric analogue
of the metamagnetic critical end point, a ""metaelectric"" critical end point has
not yet been realized. Multiferroic materials wherein magnetism and
ferroelectricity are cross-coupled are ideal candidates for the exploration of
this novel possibility using magnetic-field (\emph{H}) as a tuning parameter.
Herein, we report the discovery of a magnetic-field-induced metaelectric
transition in multiferroic BiMn$_{2}$O$_{5}$ in which the electric polarization
(\emph{P}) switches polarity along with a concomitant Mn spin-flop transition
at a critical magnetic field \emph{H}$_{\rm c}$. The simultaneous metaelectric
and spin-flop transitions become sharper upon cooling, but remain a continuous
crossover even down to 0.5 K. Near the \emph{P}=0 line realized at
$\mu_{0}$\emph{H}$_{\rm c}$$\approx$18 T below 20 K, the dielectric constant
($\varepsilon$) increases significantly over wide field- and temperature
(\emph{T})-ranges. Furthermore, a characteristic power-law behavior is found in
the \emph{P}(\emph{H}) and $\varepsilon$(\emph{H}) curves at \emph{T}=0.66 K.
These findings indicate that a magnetic-field-induced metaelectric critical end
point is realized in BiMn$_2$O$_5$ near zero temperature.
