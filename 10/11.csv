solution of open string field theory. The closed string state is a nonlinear
functional of the open string field and changes by a BRST-exact term under a
gauge transformation of the solution. As a result, its contraction with an
on-shell closed string state provides a gauge-invariant observable of open
string field theory. Unlike previously known observables, however, the
contraction with off-shell closed string states in the Fock space is well
defined and regular. Moreover, we claim that the BRST-invariant closed string
state coincides, up to a possible BRST-exact term, with the boundary state of
the boundary conformal field theory which the solution is expected to describe.
Our construction requires a choice of a propagator strip. If we choose the
Schnabl propagator strip, the BRST-invariant state becomes explicitly
calculable. We calculate it for various known analytic solutions of open string
field theory and, remarkably, we find that it precisely coincides with the
boundary state without any additional BRST-exact term. Our results imply, in
particular, that the wildly oscillatory rolling tachyon solution of open string
field theory actually describes the regular closed string physics studied by
Sen using the boundary state.

can lead to dissociation and desorption of the ice molecules. These processes
are thought to be important in the gas-grain chemistry in molecular clouds and
protoplanetary disks, but very few quantitative studies exist. We compute the
photodesorption efficiencies of amorphous water ice and elucidate the
mechanisms by which desorption occurs. Classical molecular dynamics
calculations were performed for a compact amorphous ice surface at 10 K thought
to be representative of interstellar ice. Dissociation and desorption of H2O
molecules in the top six monolayers are considered following absorption into
the first excited electronic state with photons in the 1300-1500 Angstrom
range. The trajectories of the H and OH photofragments are followed until they
escape or become trapped in the ice. The probability for H2O desorption per
absorbed UV photon is 0.5-1% in the top three monolayers, then decreases to
0.03% in the next two monolayers, and is negligible deeper into the ice. The
main H2O removal mechanism in the top two monolayers is through separate
desorption of H and OH fragments. Removal of H2O molecules from the ice, either
as H2O itself or its products, has a total probability of 2-3% per absorbed UV
photon in the top two monolayers. In the third monolayer the probability is
about 1% and deeper into the ice the probability of photodesorption falling to
insignificant numbers. The probability of any removal of H2O per incident
photon is estimated to be 3.7x10^-4, with the probability for photodesorption
of intact H2O molecules being 1.4x10^-4 per incident photon. When no desorption
occurs, the H and OH products can travel up to 70 and 60 Angstroms inside or on
top of the surface during which they can react with other species.

and cluster mass. For bright galaxies (M_B < -21mag), the CMR scatter of the
elliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the S0
population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. While the
bright S0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,
the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. If we
interpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxies
in cluster cores are on average older than S0 galaxies and peripheral
elliptical galaxies (by about 0.5Gyr). CMR zero point, slope, and scatter in
the (U-B)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3

zero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (U-B)_z=0 of our
sample. We also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-type
galaxies on the red sequence. We find that, while in the majority of the
clusters most (80% to 90%) of the CMR population is composed of early-type
galaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the CMR
late-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-type

correlated with the cluster's X-ray luminosity, nor with its velocity
dispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.

most professional databases do not track the change of constitution of
benchmark portfolios, standard tests of performance suffer from the ""look-ahead
benchmark bias,"" when they use the assets constituting the benchmarks of

surprisingly large amplitude for portfolios of common stocks (up to 8% annum
for the S&P500 taken as the benchmark) -- while most studies have emphasized
related survival biases in performance of mutual and hedge funds for which the
biases can be expected to be even larger. We use the CRSP database from 1926 to
2006 and analyze the running top 500 US capitalizations to demonstrate that
this bias can account for a gross overestimation of performance metrics such as
the Sharpe ratio as well as an underestimation of risk, as measured for
instance by peak-to-valley drawdowns. We demonstrate the presence of a
significant bias in the estimation of the survival and look-ahead biases
studied in the literature. A general methodology to test the properties of
investment strategies is advanced in terms of random strategies with similar

optical bands we detect a faint elliptical nebulosity, whose brightness peak
and center position are consistent at a sub-arcsecond level with the X-ray
position of the pulsar. The field is densely packed with background stars, but
after subtraction of these stars the morphology of the object and the
orientation of its major axis appear to be in a good agreement with the
brightest inner part of the pulsar nebula torus region seen almost edge on in
X-rays. Within the nebulosity we do not resolve any point-like optical object

observed nebulosity flux as <~20%. Extracting the X-ray spectrum from the

of the interstellar extinction towards G292.0+1.8 it is reminiscent of either

the proper motions for 67 discrete filaments through two-dimensional
correlations between images from different epochs. While the motions are small,
mostly 20 to 100 milli-arcsec, they are nevertheless measurable through a
robust technique of averaging measurements from many epoch pairs. The data are
qualitatively consistent with a free-expansion model, and clearly show
systematic motions outward from a point near the center of the radio/X-ray

R.A.(2000.0) = 11:24:34.4, Dec.(2000.0) = -59:15:51, and a kinematic age of
2990+-60 years. The young pulsar PSR J1124-5916 is located 46 arcsec southeast

particularly exciting because of its realization in ultracold Fermi gases and
its possible relevance to high temperature superconductors. In the paper we
review that body of theoretical work on this subject which represents a natural
extension of the seminal papers by Leggett and by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink
(NSR). The former addressed only the ground state, now known as the
""BCS-Leggett"" wave-function and the key contributions of the latter pertain to
calculations of the superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. These two papers
have given rise to two main and, importantly, distinct, theoretical schools in
the BCS-BEC crossover literature. The first of these extends the BCS-Leggett
ground state to finite temperature and the second extends the NSR scheme away
from $T_c$ both in the superfluid and normal phases. It is now rather widely
accepted that these extensions of NSR produce a different ground state than
that first introduced by Leggett. Our analysis shows how the NSR-based approach
views the bosonic contributions more completely but it treats the fermions as
""quasi-free"". By contrast, the BCS-Leggett based approach treats the fermionic
contributions more completely but it treats the bosons as ""quasi-free"". The NSR
based schemes approach the crossover between BCS and BEC by starting from the
BEC limit and the BCS-Leggett based scheme approaches this crossover by
starting from the BCS limit. Ultimately, one would like to combine these two
schemes. In this paper we review the strengths and weaknesses of both
approaches. To reach a full understanding, it is important in the future to
invest effort in investigating in more detail the T=0 aspects of NSR-based
theory and the $T \neq 0$ aspects of BCS-Leggett theory.

harnessed to produce optical gain in a wide variety of media. This effect has
been used to produce the first silicon-based lasers and high-gain amplifiers.
Interestingly, the Raman effect can also produce intensity-dependent nonlinear
loss through a corollary process known as inverse Raman scattering (IRS). Here,
we demonstrate IRS in silicon--a process that is substantially modified by the
presence of optically-generated free carriers--achieving attenuation levels >15
dB with a pump intensity of 4 GW/cm^2. Ironically, we find that free-carrier
absorption, the detrimental effect that suppresses other nonlinear effects in
silicon, actually facilitates IRS by delaying the onset of contamination from
coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. The carriers allow significant IRS
attenuation over a wide intensity range. Silicon-based IRS could be used to
produce chip-scale wavelength-division multiplexers, optical signal inverters,

characterization of the fermionic self energy, of the pseudogap and of the
effects of superconducting coherence (in passing from above to below the
superfluid transition temperature, $T_c$).These issues have a counterpart in

theory within an effective-field-theory framework including explicit nucleons,

at N$^2$LO, {\it i.e.} ignoring loop corrections, are used in a study of

$A$=2 and 3 nuclei magnetic moments. The wave functions for $A$=2 are derived
from solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation with the Argonne $v_{18}$ (AV18)

hyperspherical-harmonics-expansion method from a realistic Hamiltonian

much attention has been paid to their 'quantitative' validation. This
unsatisfactory situation belongs amongst others on the uncertain and
contradictory experimental data base. The fundamental diagram, i.e. the
density-dependence of the flow or velocity, is probably the most important
relation as it connects the basic parameter to describe the dynamic of crowds.
But specifications in different handbooks as well as experimental measurements
differ considerably. The same is true for the bottleneck flow. After a
comprehensive review of the experimental data base we give an survey of a
research project, including experiments with up to 250 persons performed under
well controlled laboratory conditions. The trajectories of each person are
measured in high precision to analyze the fundamental diagram and the flow
through bottlenecks. The trajectories allow to study how the way of measurement
influences the resulting relations. Surprisingly we found large deviation
amongst the methods. These may be responsible for the deviation in the
literature mentioned above. The results are of particular importance for the
comparison of experimental data gained in different contexts and for the

presented by Shen et al., we find that AGNs in the redshift range 0.3-0.9, for
which a given object can have both H-beta and MgII line widths measured,
display a modest but correctable discrepancy in MgII-based masses that
correlates with the Eddington ratio. We use the SDSS database to estimate the
probability distribution of the true (i.e., H-beta-based) mass given a measured
MgII line width. These probability distributions are then applied to the SDSS
measurements from Shen et al. across the entire MgII-accessible redshift range
(0.3-2.2). We find that accounting for this residual correlation generally
increases the dispersion of Eddington ratios by a small factor (~0.09 dex for
the redshift and luminosity bins we consider). We continue to find that the
intrinsic distribution of Eddington ratios for luminous AGNs is extremely
narrow, 0.3-0.4 dex, as demonstrated by Kollmeier et al. Using the method we
describe, MgII emission lines can be used with confidence to obtain BH mass
estimates.

Pseudo-bulges are currently undergoing intense star formation activity and

classical bulges are quiescent and populate the red sequence of the diagram.
Classical bulges follow a correlation between bulge Sersic index and
bulge-to-total ratio, while pseudo-bulges do not. In addition, for a fixed
bulge-to-total ratio, pseudo-bulges are less concentrated than classical
bulges. Pseudo-bulges follow a mass-size relation similar to that followed by
bars, and different from that followed by classical bulges. In the fundamental
plane, pseudo-bulges occupy the same locus as discs. While these results point
out different formation processes for classical and pseudo-bulges, we also find
a significant overlap in their properties, indicating that the different
processes might happen concomitantly. Finally, classical bulges and ellipticals
follow offset mass-size relations, suggesting that high-mass bulges might not

terms of morphology, ~60% of the members of the sample are disk-dominated, and
all of these are consistent with containing a bulge or (more likely)
pseudobulge, while the remainder are compact systems with no discernible disk
component. In general the compact components of the galaxies do not obey the
fundamental plane of giant elliptical galaxies and classical bulges, but rather
are less centrally concentrated at a given luminosity, much like spheroidal
galaxies. Our results strongly confirm that a classical bulge is not a
requirement for a nuclear black hole. At the same time, the observed ratio of
black hole to bulge mass is nearly an order of magnitude lower in this sample
than that seen for classical bulges. While the M-sigma relation appears to
continue to low mass, it seems that black hole-galaxy scaling relations do
depend on galaxy structure.

detect optical spiral tracers beyond the Carina branch, where radio
observations and models predictions indicate the presence of the extension of
the Perseus and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant.Along this line
of sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. Two of them, at 2.5

followed with 12 X-ray grating observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We
present detailed spectral analyses using two independent approaches. From the
best dataset, taken on day 13.8 after outburst, we reconstruct the temperature
distribution and derive elemental abundances. We find evidence for at least two
distinct temperature components on day 13.8 and a reduction of temperature with
time. The X-ray flux decreases as a power-law, and the power-law index changes
from -5/3 to -8/3 around day 70 after outburst. This can be explained by
different decay mechanisms for the hot and cool components. The decay of the
hot component and the decrease in temperature are consistent with radiative
cooling, while the decay of the cool component can be explained by the
expansion of the ejecta. We find overabundances of N and of alpha-elements,
which could either represent the composition of the secondary that provides the
accreted material or that of the ejecta. The N overabundance indicates
CNO-cycled material. From comparisons to abundances for the secondary taken
from the literature, we conclude that 20-40% of the observed nitrogen could
originate from the outburst. The overabundance of the alpha-elements is not
typical for stars of the spectral type of the secondary in the RS Oph system,
and white dwarf material might have been mixed into the ejecta. However, no
direct measurements of the alpha-elements in the secondary are available, and
the continuous accretion may have changed the observable surface composition.

moment (EDM) because of their spherical symmetry. Therefore, there is no polar
atom in nature except for polar molecules. The electric susceptibility Xe
caused by the orientation of polar substances is inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature T while the induced susceptibility of atoms is temperature
independent. This difference in temperature dependence offers a means of
separating the polar and non-polar substances experimentally. Using special
capacitor our experiments discovered that the relationship between Xe of
Potassium atom and T is just Xe=B/T, where the slope B is approximately 283(K)
as polar molecules, but appears to be disordered using the traditional
capacitor. Its capacitance C at different voltage V was measured. The C-V curve
shows that the saturation polarization of K vapor has be observed when E more
than 105V/m and nearly all K atoms (over 98.9 per cent) are lined up with the
field! The ground state neutral K atom is polar atom with a large EDM: dK more

and parity) violation in K atoms. If K atom has a large EDM, why the linear
Stark effect has not been observed? The article discussed the question
thoroughly. Our results are easy to be repeated because the details of the

  Klenian groups are good",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We initiate the study of profinite groups of non-negative deficiency. The
principal focus of the paper is to show that the existence of a finitely
generated normal subgroup of infinite index in a profinite group $G$ of
non-negative deficiency gives rather strong consequences for the structure of
$G$. To make this precise we introduce the notion of $p$-deficiency ($p$ a
prime) for a profinite group $G$. This concept is more useful in the study of
profinite groups then the notion of deficiency. We prove that if the
$p$-deficiency of $G$ is positive and $N$ is a finitely generated normal
subgroup such that the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G/N$ is infinite and $p$ divides
the order of $N$ then we have $\cd_p(G)=2$, $\cd_p(N)=1$ and $\vcd_p(G/N)=1$
for the cohomological $p$-dimensions; moreover either the $p$-Sylow subgroup of
$G/N$ is virtually cyclic or the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $N$ is cyclic. A
profinite Poincar\'e duality group $G$ of dimension 3 at a prime $p$
($PD^3$-group) has deficiency 0. In this case we show that for $N$ and $p$ as
above either $N$ is $PD^1$ at $p$ and $G/N$ is virtually $PD^2$ at $p$ or $N$
is $PD^2$ at $p$ and $G/N$ is virtually $PD^1$ at $p$. In particular if $G$ is
pro-$p$ then either $N$ is infinite cyclic and $G/N$ is virtually Demushkin or
$N$ is Demushkin and $G/N$ is virtually infinite cyclic. We apply this results
to deduce structural information on the profinite completions of ascending
HNN-extensions of free groups. We also give some implications of our theory to
the congruence kernels of certain arithmetic groups.

We observe regimes of both global collapse, where the system evolves to a
highly elongated or flattened state depending on the sign of the dipolar
interaction, and local collapse, which arises due to dynamically unstable
phonon modes and leads to a periodic arrangement of density shells, disks or
stripes. In the adiabatic regime, where ground states are followed, collapse
can occur globally or locally, while in the non-adiabatic regime, where
collapse is initiated suddenly, local collapse commonly occurs. We analyse the
dependence on the dipolar interactions and trap geometry, the length and time
scales for collapse, and relate our findings to recent experiments.

study the solar inner radiative zone. Indeed, g modes should be the best probes
to infer the properties of the solar nuclear core that represents more than
half of the total mass of the Sun. Concerning the dynamics of the solar core,
we can study how future observations of individual g modes could enhance our
knowledge of the rotation profile of the deep radiative zone. Applying
inversions on a set of real p-mode splittings coupled with either one or
several g modes, we have checked the improvement of the inferred rotation
profile when different error bars are considered for the g modes. Moreover,
using a new methodology based on the analysis of the almost constant separation
of the dipole gravity modes, we can introduce new constraints on solar models.
For that purpose, we can compare g-mode predictions computed from several
models including different physical inputs with the g-mode asymptotic signature
detected in GOLF data and calculate the correlation. This work shows the great
consistency between the signature of dipole gravity modes and our knowledge of
p-modes: incompatibility of data with a present standard model including the

Suzaku observation, but revealed a narrow bump peaked at ~ 0.9 keV. The latter

temperature of about 0.8 keV. Because of the high pressure implied for
spatially extended hot gas, the emission is likely a sum of unresolved faint
sources. We consider a large fraction of the emission originates from faint dM
stars. We constructed a model spectrum for spatially unresolved dM stars that
consistently explains the observed spectrum and the surface brightness. The
model also suggests that the emission from dM stars decreases very rapidly with
increasing b, and thus that it cannot compensate entirely the decrease of the

(substructure) is an important test of cold dark matter. One approach to
measuring the substructure mass fraction is to analyze the fluxes of images
that have been strongly lensed by a galaxy. Flux ratios between images that are
anomalous with respect to smooth (no substructure) models have previously
suggested that there is a greater amount of substructure than found in dark
matter simulations. One measure of anomalous flux ratios is parity dependence
-- that the fluxes of different images of a source are perturbed differently.
In this paper, we discuss parity dependence as a probe of dark matter
substructure. We find that reproducing the observed parity dependence requires
a significant alignment between concentrated dark matter clumps and images. The
results may imply a larger fraction of mass in substructures than suggested by
some dark matter simulations and that the observed parity dependence is
unlikely to be reproduced by luminous satellites of lens galaxies.
