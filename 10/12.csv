prevents the dewetting transition and produces a repulsive solvent-induced

showing that the inter-plate gap remains wet until steric constraints at small

predict the critical distance of dewetting. These results indicate that
hydrophobic interactions between nanoscale surfaces with strong large

algebra sl_2. Denoting this basis by {x,y,z}, we have
  [x,y] = 2x + 2y, [y,z] = 2y + 2z, [z, x] = 2z + 2x.
  One focus of our study is the group of automorphisms G generated by exp(ad
x*), exp(ad y*), exp(ad z*), where {x*,y*,z*} is the basis for sl_2 dual to
{x,y,z} with respect to the trace form (u,v) = tr(uv). We show that G is
isomorphic to the modular group PSL_2(Z). Another focus of our investigation is
the lattice L=Zx+Zy+Zz. We prove that the orbit G(x) equals {u in L |(u,u)=2}.
We determine the precise relationship between (i) the group G, (ii) the group
of automorphisms for sl_2 that preserve L, (iii) the group of automorphisms and
antiautomorphisms for sl_2 that preserve L, and (iv) the group of isometries
for (,) that preserve L. We obtain analogous results for the lattice L*
=Zx*+Zy*+Zz*. Relative to the equitable basis, the matrix of the trace form is
a Cartan matrix of hyperbolic type; consequently,we identify the equitable
basis with the set of simple roots of the corresponding Kac-Moody Lie algebra
g. Then L is the root lattice for g and 1/2L* is the weight lattice, and G(x)
coincides with the set of real roots for g. Using L, L*, and G, we give several
descriptions of the isotropic roots for g and show that each isotropic root has
multiplicity 1. We describe the finite-dimensional sl_2-modules from the point
of view of the equitable basis. In the final section, we establish a connection
between the Weyl group orbit of the fundamental weights of g and Pythagorean
triples.

thermal inertia like that of the Moon and span a range of plausible radii. The
planets are assumed to have thermal and orbital properties that mimic those of
the Earth while their obliquities and orbital longitudes of inferior
conjunction remain free parameters. Even if the gross thermal properties of the
planet can be independently constrained (e.g. via spectroscopy or
visible-wavelength detection of specular glint from a surface ocean) only the
largest (approximately Mars-size) lunar-like satellites can be detected by
light curve data from a TPF-like instrument (i.e. one that achieves a
photometric signal-to-noise of 10-20 at infrared wavelengths). Non-detection of
a lunar-like satellite can obfuscate the interpretation of a given system's
infrared light curve so that it may resemble a single planet with high
obliquity, different orbital longitude of vernal equinox relative to inferior
conjunction and in some cases drastically different thermal characteristics. If
the thermal properties of the planet are not independently established then the
presence of a lunar-like satellite cannot be inferred from infrared data, thus
demonstrating that photometric light curves alone can only be used for
preliminary study of extra-solar Earth-like planets.

different quantum numbers. Two of these Fock spaces include negative norm

is then classified in unitary representations of the Lorentz group SO(d,1).
Moreover all states of the single oscillator put together make up a single

enabled us to search for its optical companion with the RTT-150 and 6-m BTA

giant magnetoresistance (GMR) for which Fert[1] and Grunberg[2] were awarded
the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physics. GMR arises from differential scattering of
the majority and minority spin electrons by a ferromagnet (FM) so that the
resistance when the FM layers separated by non-magnetic (NM) spacers are
aligned by an applied field is different to when they are antiparallel. In 1996
Slonczewski[3] and Berger[4] predicted that a large spin-polarised current
could transfer spin-angular momentum and so exert a spin transfer torque (STT)
sufficient to switch thin FM layers between stable magnetisation states[5] and,
for even higher current densities, drive continuous precession which emits
microwaves[6]. Thus, while GMR is a purely passive phenomenon which ultimately
depends on the intrinsic band structure of the FM, STT adds an active element
to spintronics by which the direction of the magnetisation may be manipulated.
Here we show that highly non-equilibrium spin injection can modify the
scattering asymmetry and, by extension, the intrinsic magnetism of a FM. This
phenomenon is completely different to STT and provides a third ingredient which
should further expand the range of opportunities for the application of
spintronics.

the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ lie on the line $\Re(s) =1/2$. The density
hypothesis is a conjectured estimate $N(\lambda, T) =O\bigl(T\sp{2(1-\lambda)

of zeros of $\zeta(s)$ when $\Re(s) \ge\lambda$ and $0 <\Im(s) \le T$, with
$1/2 \le \lambda \le 1$ and $T >0$. The Riemann-von Mangoldt Theorem confirms
this estimate when $\lambda =1/2$, with $T\sp{\epsilon}$ being replaced by
$\log T$. In an attempt to transform Backlund's proof of the Riemann-von
Mangoldt Theorem to a proof of the density hypothesis by convexity, we
discovered a different approach utilizing an auxiliary function. The crucial
point is that this function should be devised to be symmetric with respect to
$\Re(s) =1/2$ and about the size of the Euler Gamma function on the right hand
side of the line $\Re(s) =1/2$. Moreover, it should be analytic and without any
zeros in the concerned region. We indeed found such a function, which we call
pseudo-Gamma function. With its help, we are able to establish a proof of the
density hypothesis. Actually, we give the result explicitly and our result is
even stronger than the original density hypothesis, namely it yields
$N(\lambda, T) \le 8.734 \log T$ for any $1/2 < \lambda < 1$ and $T\ge

between outermost two relativistic images (both of them either on the primary
or on the secondary image side) is extremely insensitive to changes in the
angular source position as well as the lens-source and lens-observer distances.
Therefore, this ratio can be used to obtain very accurate values for masses of
black holes at centers of galaxies. Similarly, angular separations between any
two relativistic images are also extremely insensitive to changes in the
angular source position and the lens-source distance. Therefore, with the known
value of mass of a black hole, angular separation between two relativistic
images would give a very accurate result for the distance of the black hole.
Accuracies in determination of masses and distances of black holes would
however depend on accuracies in measurements of differential time delays and
angular separations between images. Deflection angles of primary and secondary
images as well as effective deflection angles of relativistic images on the
secondary image side are always positive. However, the effective deflection
angles of relativistic images on the primary image side may be positive, zero,
or negative depending on the value of angular source position and the ratio of

mag) and metallicities (7.5 to 9.2 in units of 12+log[O/H]). We describe the
setup of the VLA observations, the data reduction procedures and the creation
of the final THINGS data products. We present an atlas of the integrated HI
maps, the velocity fields, the second moment (velocity dispersion) maps and
individual channel maps of each THINGS galaxy. The THINGS data products are
made publicly available through a dedicated webpage. Accompanying THINGS papers
address issues such as the small-scale structure of the ISM, the (dark) matter
distribution in THINGS galaxies, and the processes leading to star formation.
