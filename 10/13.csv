near the southern galactic pole and the galactic equator, are smoothed with
Gaussian filters of width ranging from 5 to 8 Mpc/h to produce a continuous
galaxy density field. The topological genus statistic is used to measure the
relative abundance of overdense clusters to void regions at each scale; these
results are compared to the predictions of analytic theory, in the form of the
genus statistic for i) the linear regime case of a Gaussian random field; and
ii) a first-order perturbative expansion of the weakly non-linear evolved

non-linear effects of gravitational evolution and biased galaxy formation, and
demonstrate that these effects evolve as a function of scale. We find that
neither analytic prescription satisfactorily reproduces the measurements,

folding mechanisms, here we have investigated the folding energy landscape of
an alpha/beta protein, apoflavodoxin, in the presence of inert macromolecular
crowding agents using in silico and in vitro approaches. By coarse-grained
molecular simulations and topology-based potential interactions, we probed the
effects of increased volume fraction of crowding agents (phi_c) as well as of
crowding agent geometry (sphere or spherocylinder) at high phi_c. Parallel
kinetic folding experiments with purified Desulfovibro desulfuricans
apoflavodoxin in vitro were performed in the presence of Ficoll (sphere) and
Dextran (spherocylinder) synthetic crowding agents. In conclusion, we have
identified in silico crowding conditions that best enhance protein stability
and discovered that upon manipulation of the crowding conditions, folding
routes experiencing topological frustrations can be either enhanced or
relieved. The test-tube experiments confirmed that apoflavodoxin's
time-resolved folding path is modulated by crowding agent geometry. We propose
that macromolecular crowding effects may be a tool for manipulation of protein

the doubled p-value and has an intuitive appeal. Its use is advocated for both
continuous and discrete distributions. An important advantage of this p-value
is that equivalent 1-sided tests are transformed into $P_C$-equivalent 2-sided
tests. It is compared to the widely used doubled and minimum likelihood
p-values. Examples include the variance test, the binomial and the Fisher's
exact test.

The reason for the different magnetic structures is shown to be the varying
potential barrier across the interface, which controls the leakage of the
Mn-e$_g$ electrons from the LMO side to the SMO side. This in turn affects the
interfacial magnetism via the carrier-mediated Zener double exchange. For n=1
superlattice, the Mn-e$_g$ electrons are more or less spread over the entire
lattice, so that the magnetic behavior is similar to the equivalent alloy
compound La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. For larger n, the e$_g$ electron transfer
occurs mostly between the two layers adjacent to the interface, thus leaving
the magnetism unchanged and bulk-like away from the interface region.

of the gene product. These fluctuations can interfere with optimal function or
can be exploited to generate beneficial diversity between cells; gene
expression noise is therefore expected to be subject to evolutionary pressure.
Shifts between modes of high and low rates of transcription initiation at a
promoter appear to contribute to this noise both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
However, models invoked for eukaryotic promoter noise such as stable activation
scaffolds or persistent nucleosome alterations seem unlikely to apply to
prokaryotic promoters. We consider the relative importance of the steps
required for transcription initiation. The 3-step transcription initiation
model of McClure is extended into a mathematical model that can be used to
predict consequences of additional promoter properties. We show in principle
that the transcriptional bursting observed at an E. coli promoter by Golding et
al. (2005) can be explained by stimulation of initiation by the negative
supercoiling behind a transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) or by the formation of
moribund or dead-end RNAP-promoter complexes. Both mechanisms are tunable by
the alteration of promoter kinetics and therefore allow the optimization of
promoter mediated noise.

neurons can itself be stimulus-dependent. We examine how this dependence
impacts the information carried by neural populations about the stimuli that
drive them. Stimulus-dependent changes in correlations can both carry
information directly and modulate the information separately carried by the
firing rates and variances. We use Fisher information to quantify these effects
and show that, although stimulus dependent correlations often carry little
information directly, their modulatory effects on the overall information can
be large. In particular, if the stimulus-dependence is such that correlations
increase with stimulus-induced firing rates, this can significantly enhance the
information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined
solely by the stimulus. However, in the presence of additional strong spatial
decay of correlations, such stimulus-dependence may have a negative impact.
Opposite relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing rates.

the joint (generalized) spectral radius of matrix sets has been discussed in a
number of publications. The method of Barabanov norms was the key instrument in
disproving the Lagarias-Wang Finiteness Conjecture. The related constructions
were essentially based on the study of the geometrical properties of the unit
balls of some specific Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one
fails to find among current publications any detailed analysis of the
geometrical properties of the unit balls of Barabanov norms looks a bit
paradoxical. Partially this is explained by the fact that Barabanov norms are
defined nonconstructively, by an implicit procedure. So, even in simplest cases
it is very difficult to visualize the shape of their unit balls. The present
work may be treated as the first step to make up this deficiency. In the paper
two iteration procedure are considered that allow to build numerically
Barabanov norms for the irreducible matrix sets and simultaneously to compute
the joint spectral radius of these sets.

highly parallel to that of thermal equilibrium between two systems of particles
that exchange energy, where one system corresponds to the source and the other
corresponds to the channel. The thermodynamical entopies of the dual physical
problem are analogous to conditional and unconditional Shannon entropies of the
source, and so, their balance in thermal equilibrium yields a simple formula
for the mutual information between the source and the channel output, that is
induced by the typical code in an ensemble of joint source--channel codes under
certain conditions. We also demonstrate how our results can be used in
applications, like the wiretap channel, and how can it be extended to multiuser

an equally important role. An essential issue which has been overlooked up to
now, is an energy shift of the resonance line due to the direct influence of
the binding energies of the 3H and 3He atoms in the lattice on the energy of
the electron antineutrinos. This energy shift as well as the second-order
Doppler shift exhibit variations in a non-perfect (inhomogeneous) lattice and

nuclei (AGN) currently available, extracted from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey
(VVDS), to compute MgII and CIV virial masses estimate of 120 super-massive
black holes in the redshift range 1.0<z<1.9 and 2.6<z<4.3. We find that the
mass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low AGN
luminosities (log L_bol ~ 45). At these luminosities, there is a substantial
fraction of black holes accreting far below their Eddington limit (L_bol/L_Edd
< 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for AGN of higher
luminosities. We speculate that these may be AGN on the decaying branch of
their light-curves, well past their peak activity. This would agree with recent
theoretical predictions of AGN evolution.
  In the electronic Appendix of this paper we publish an update of the VVDS
type-1 AGN sample, including the first and most of the second epoch
observations. This sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

is given. Causal perturbation theory is a mathematically rigorous approach to
renormalization theory, which makes it possible to put the theoretical setup of
perturbative quantum field theory on a sound mathematical basis by avoiding
infinities from the outset. It goes back to a seminal work by Henri Epstein and
Vladimir Jurko Glaser published in 1973, where a specific causality condition
was imposed at every order of perturbation theory in the case of scalar quantum
field theory such that divergent integrals could be avoided in actual
calculations of loop diagrams. In the meantime, the causal approach has been
applied also to a wide range of gauge theories.

studied, the data are probably not representative of the true CAI modal
abundances, explaining their reported large scatter in a single chondrite
group. Carbonaceous chondrites have excess bulk Al concentrations when compared
to the CI-chondritic value. We find a correlation between this excess and CAI
modal abundances and conclude that the excess Al was delivered by CAIs. The
excess Al is only a minor fraction (usually ~10 rel%, but 25 rel% in case of
CVs) of the bulk chondrite Al and cannot have contributed much 26Al to heat the
chondrite parent body. Ordinary, enstatite, R- and K-chondrites have an Al
deficit relative to CI chondrites and only very low CAI modal abundances, if
any are present at all. Carbonaceous chondrites also had an initial Al deficit
if the contribution of Al delivered by CAIs is subtracted. Therefore all
chondrites probably lost a refractory rich high-T component. Only minor amounts
of CAIs are present in the matrix or have been present in the chondrule
precursor aggregates. Most CAI size distributions contain more than one size
population, indicating that CAIs from within a single meteorite group had
different origins.

as the input and output leads and we use a tight-binding Hamiltonian with
nearest-neighbor hops. For narrow ribbons we find transmission gaps for both
types of edges. The center of the gap is at the middle of the band in ribbons
with armchair edges. This symmetry is due to a property satisfied by the
matrices in the resulting linear problem. In ribbons with zigzag edges the gap
center is displaced to the right of the middle of the band. We also find
transmission oscillations and resonances within the transmitting region of the

the width of the transmission gap, as long as the ribbon's length is longer
than a critical value when the gap can form. Increasing the width of the
ribbon, however, changes the width of the gap. In armchair edges the gap is not
well-defined because of the appearance of transmission resonances while in
zigzag edges the gap width systematically shrinks as the width of the ribbon is
increased. We also find only evanescent waves within the gap and both
evanescent and propagating waves in the transmitting regions.

We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of an intense
gamma-ray flare from the gamma-ray source 3EG J1255-0549, associated to the
Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279, during the AGILE pointings towards the Virgo
Region on 2007 July 9-13.
  Aims. The simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray covering allows us to
study the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the theoretical models
relative to the flaring episode of mid-July.
  Methods. AGILE observed the source during its Science Performance
Verification Phase with its two co-aligned imagers: the Gamma- Ray Imaging
Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) sensitive in the 30 MeV
- 50 GeV and 18 - 60 keV respectively. During the AGILE observation the source
was monitored simultaneously in optical band by the REM telescope and in the
X-ray band by the Swift satellite through 4 ToO observations.
  Results. During 2007 July 9-13 July 2007, AGILE-GRID detected gamma-ray
emission from 3C 279, with the source at ~2 deg from the center of the Field of
View, with an average flux of (210+-38) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for energy above
100 MeV. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-sigma upper limit of
10 mCrab. During the observation lasted about 4 days no significative gamma-ray
flux variation was observed.
  Conclusions. The Spectral Energy Distribution is modelled with a homogeneous
one-zone Synchrotron Self Compton emission plus the contributions by external
Compton scattering of direct disk radiation and, to a lesser extent, by
external Compton scattering of photons from the Broad Line Region.

the observed frequencies to be used successfully as seismic probes for these
objects, we need to concentrate on stars where we can constrain the number of

hydrodynamic behaviour. The gauge-gravity duality then relates the boundary
hydrodynamics for generalized gravity to that of gauge theories with large
finite values of 't Hooft coupling. We discuss, for this framework, the
hydrodynamics of the shear mode in generalized theories of gravity in d+1
dimensions. It is shown that the shear diffusion coefficients of the
near-horizon and boundary hydrodynamics are equal and can be expressed in a
form that is purely local to the horizon. We find that the Einstein-theory
relation between the shear diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity to
entropy ratio is modified for generalized gravity theories: Both can be
explicitly written as the ratio of a pair of polarization-specific
gravitational couplings but implicate differently polarized gravitons. Our
analysis is restricted to the shear-mode fluctuations for simplicity and
clarity; however, our methods can be applied to the hydrodynamics of all

the gravitational potential prevailing in the outer parts of the galaxy and,
thereof, construct the tt- component of the metric of the embedding spacetime.
Next we examine a perfect fluid candidate as the dark companion and solve the
relevant GR equations. We are able to determine the strength and the
distribution of the dark fluid that accompanies a point baryonic mass. Finally,
we argue that the whole paradigm can be explained just as well in terms of an
alternative theory.

Brownian particles immersed in a two-dimensional periodic potential. In this
paper, we concentrate essentially on the behaviour of the tracer (DTr) and bulk
(DB) diffusion coefficients as function of friction. Our simulations show that
in the high friction limit, the two physical quantities DTr and DB present
qualitatively the same behaviour, for both coupled and decoupled substrate
potentials. However, for the low friction regime, and especially for the
coupled potential case, an anomalous diffusion behaviour is found. We also
found that in the case of weak dynamical coupling between the ad-particles and
the substrate, the exponents are not universal and rather depend on the
potentials. Moreover, changes in the inter-particle potentials may reverse the
behaviour to a normal one.

weak shear. The dynamo is kinematic and due to fluctuations in the net

quasilinear calculation aiming to put the shear dynamo, a new effect recently

the model suggests that shear dynamo action may be a generic property of

low temperature is still a matter of debate. In dense clouds, the hydrogenation
of adsorbed species (i.e., CO), as well as the subsequent deuteration of the
accreted molecules depend on the mobility of H atoms on water ice.
Astrochemical models widely assume that H atoms are mobile on the surface of
dust grains even if controversy still exists. We present here direct
experimental evidence of the mobility of H atoms on porous water ice surfaces
at 10 K. Methods. In a UHV chamber, O2 is deposited on a porous amorphous water
ice substrate. Then D atoms are deposited onto the surface held at 10 K.
Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) is used and desorptions of O2 and D2
are simultaneously monitored. Results. We find that the amount of O2 that
desorb during the TPD diminishes if we increase the deposition time of D atoms.
O2 is thus destroyed by D atoms even though these molecules have previously
diffused inside the pores of thick water ice. Our results can be easily
interpreted if D is mobile at 10 K on the water ice surface. A simple rate
equation model fits our experimental data and best fit curves were obtained for
a D atoms diffusion barrier of 22(+-)2 meV. Therefore hydrogenation can take
place efficiently on interstellar dust grains. These experimental results are
in line with most calculations and validate the hypothesis used in several
models.

observables (spectral properties, colours, and morphology), exploiting the data
set provided by the COSMOS/zCOSMOS survey. The purpose of this paper is to
define a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sample
of around 1000 galaxies. Methods. Using medium resolution spectra of the first
1k zCOSMOS-bright sample, optical photometry from the Subaru/COSMOS
observations, and morphological measurements derived from ACS imaging, we
analyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. Applying three
straightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, and
morphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked to
the bimodality of galaxy population. The three parametric classifications
constitute the axes of a ""classification cube"". Results. A very good agreement
exists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forming
galaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). The third parameter
(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a good
correlation between the spectral classification and that based on morphological
analysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partially
complementing the morphological classification with additional colour
information. Finally, analyzing the 3D-distribution of all galaxies in the
sample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordant
classification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) or
star-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). These results imply that
the galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour and
dominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.

polynomial sequence $\{\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}^2q^k\}_{n\geq 0}$. By using
Pieri's rule and the Jacobi-Trudi identity for Schur functions, we obtain an
expansion of a sum of products of elementary symmetric functions in terms of
Schur functions with nonnegative coefficients. Then the principal
specialization leads to the q-log-convexity. We also prove that a technical
condition of Liu and Wang holds for the squares of the binomial coefficients.
Hence we deduce that the linear transformation with respect to the triangular
array $\{{n\choose k}^2\}_{0\leq k\leq n}$ is log-convexity preserving.

severely limited by the actual resolution of ground-based telescopes. On the
other hand, the Hubble Space Telescope does not provide the near-infrared (NIR)
filters needed to allow large color baselines. In this work we aim at
demonstrating how ground based observations can reach the required resolution
when using Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optic (MCAO) devices in the NIR, such as
the experimental infrared camera (MAD) available on the VLT. This is
particularly important since these corrections are planned to be available on
all ground--based telescopes in the near future. We do this by combining the
infrared photometry obtained by MAD/VLT with ACS/HST optical photometry of our
scientific target, the bulge globular cluster NGC 6388, in which we imaged two
fields. In particular, we constructed color-magnitude diagrams with an
extremely wide color baseline in order to investigate the presence of multiple
stellar populations in this cluster. From the analysis of the external field,
observed with better seeing conditions, we derived the deepest optical-NIR CMD
of NGC 6388 to date. The high-precision photometry reveals that two distinct
sub-giant branches are clearly present in this cluster. We also use the CMD
from the central region to estimate the distance ((m-M)=15.33) and the
reddening (E(B-V)=0.38) for this cluster. We estimate the age to be ~11.5+/-
1.5 Gyr. The large relative-age error reflects the bimodal distribution of the
SGB stars. This study clearly demonstrates how MCAO correction in the NIR bands
implemented on ground based telescopes can complement the high-resolution
optical data from HST.

describe the Green functions of a theory and mirror the recursive decomposition
of Feynman diagrams into subdiagrams. Taken as recursive equations, the
Dyson-Schwinger equations describe perturbative quantum field theory. However,
they also contain non-perturbative information.
  Using the Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs we will follow a sequence of
reductions to convert the Dyson-Schwinger equations to the following system of
differential equations,
  \[
  \gamma_1^r(x) = P_r(x) - \sgn(s_r)\gamma_1^r(x)^2 + (\sum_{j \in
\mathcal{R}}|s_j|\gamma_1^j(x)) x \partial_x \gamma_1^r(x) \] where $r \in
\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of amplitudes of the theory which need
renormalization, $\gamma_1^r$ is the anomalous dimension associated to $r$,
$P_r(x)$ is a modified version of the function for the primitive skeletons
contributing to $r$, and $x$ is the coupling constant. Next, we approach the
new system of differential equations as a system of recursive equations by
expanding $\gamma_1^r(x) = \sum_{n \geq 1}\gamma^r_{1,n} x^n$. We obtain the
radius of convergence of $\sum \gamma^r_{1,n}x^n/n!$ in terms of that of $\sum
P_r(n)x^n/n!$. In particular we show that a Lipatov bound for the growth of the
primitives leads to a Lipatov bound for the whole theory. Finally, we make a
few observations on the new system considered as differential equations.

simulations of both, extensive air showers and the detectors involved in their
detection. In particular, the energy calibration of several experiments is
obtained from simulations. Also, in composition studies simulations play a
fundamental role because the primary mass is determined by comparing
experimental with simulated data. At the highest energies the detailed
simulation of air showers is very costly in processing time and disk space due
to the large number of secondary particles generated in interactions with the
atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the statistics, it is quite common
to recycle single showers many times to simulate the detector response. As a
result, the events of the Monte Carlo samples generated in this way are not
fully independent. In this work we study the artificial effects introduced by
the multiple use of single air showers for the detector simulations. In
particular, we study in detail the effects introduced by the repetitions in the
kernel density estimators which are frequently used in composition studies.

from a high thermodynamic stability and slow (de)hydrogenation kinetics.
Alloying Mg with lightweight transition metals (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr) aims at
improving the thermodynamic and kinetic properties. We study the structure and
stability of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ compounds, $x=[0$-1], by first-principles
calculations at the level of density functional theory. We find that the
experimentally observed sharp decrease in hydrogenation rates for $x\gtrsim0.8$
correlates with a phase transition of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ from a fluorite to
a rutile phase. The stability of these compounds decreases along the series Sc,
Ti, V, Cr. Varying the transition metal (TM) and the composition $x$, the
formation enthalpy of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ can be tuned over the substantial
range 0-2 eV/f.u. Assuming however that the alloy Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$ does not
decompose upon dehydrogenation, the enthalpy associated with reversible
hydrogenation of compounds with a high magnesium content ($x=0.75$) is close to
that of pure Mg.
