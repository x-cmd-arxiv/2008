the large-scale structure. We develop the counts-in-cells framework for the

non-Gaussian covariance matrix. We show, that for the usual auto-power
statistic, besides the off-diagonal covariance generated through gravitational
mode-coupling, the discreteness of the tracers and their associated sampling
distribution can generate strong off-diagonal covariance, and that this becomes
the dominant source of covariance as k>>k_f=2 pi/L. On comparison with the
derived expressions for the cross-power covariance, we show that the
off-diagonal terms can be suppressed, if one cross-correlates a high
tracer-density sample with a low one. Taking the effective estimator efficiency
to be proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SN), we show that, to probe
clustering as a function of physical properties of the sample, i.e. cluster
mass or galaxy luminosity, then the cross-power approach can out perform the
auto-power one by factors of a few. We confront the theory with measurements of
the mass-mass, halo-mass, and halo-halo power spectra from a large ensemble of
N-body simulations. We show that there is a significant SN advantage to be
gained from using the cross-power approach when studying the bias of rare
haloes. The analysis is repeated in configuration space and again SN
improvement is found. We estimate the covariance matrix for these samples, and
find strong off-diagonal contributions. The covariance depends on halo mass,
with higher mass samples having stronger covariance. In agreement with theory,
we show that the covariance is suppressed for the cross-power. This work points
the way towards improved estimators for clustering studies.

gamma-ray bursts detected so far, GRB 080913. Based on these observations, we
consider whether it could be classified as a short-duration GRB and discuss the
implications for the progenitor nature and energy extraction mechanisms.
  Methods: Multiwavelength X-ray, near IR and millimetre observations were made
between 20.7 hours and 16.8 days after the event.
  Results: Whereas a very faint afterglow was seen at the 3.5m CAHA telescope
in the nIR, the X-ray afterglow was clearly detected in both Swift and
XMM-Newton observations. An upper limit is reported in the mm range. We have
modeled the data assuming a collimated $\theta_0$ $\gtrsim$ 3$^\circ$ blast
wave with an energy injection at 0.5 days carrying $5\sim 10^{52}$ erg or
approximately 12 times the initial energy of the blast wave. We find that GRB
080913 shares many of the gamma-ray diagnostics with the more recent burst GRB
090423 for being classified as short had they ocurred at low redshift. If the
progenitor were a compact binary merger, it is likely composed by a NS and BH.
The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism is the preferred one to extract energy from
the central, maximally-rotating BH. Both the magnetic field close to the event
horizon (B) and the BH mass ($M_{bh}$) are restricted within a relatively
narrow range, such that $(B / 3\times 10^{16} \rm{G}) (M_{bh} / 7 M_\odot) \sim
1$. Similar constraints on the central BH hold for collapsar-like progenitor
systems if the BZ-mechanism works for the system at hand.

that the subhalo mass function departs significantly from a power law at the
high mass end. We also find that the radial and angular distributions of
substructures depend on subhalo mass. In particular, high mass subhaloes tend
to be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to
the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less
massive counterparts. We find that mergers between subhaloes occur. These tend
to be between substructures that were already dynamically associated before
accretion into the main halo. For subhaloes larger than 0.001 times the mass of
the host halo, it is more likely that the subhalo will merge with the central
or main subhalo than with another subhalo larger than itself. For lower masses,
subhalo-subhalo mergers become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo.
Our results have implications for the variation of galaxy properties with

whether such bodies harbour satellite systems has become one of increasing
interest. In this paper, we explore the transit timing effects that should be
detectable due to an exomoon and predict a new observable. We first consider
transit time variation (TTV), where we update the model to include the effects
of orbital eccentricity. We draw two key conclusions: 1) In order to maintain
Hill stability, the orbital frequency of the exomoon will always be higher than
the sampling frequency. Therefore, the period of the exomoon cannot be reliably
determined from TTV, only a set of harmonic frequencies. 2) The TTV amplitude
is proportional to M_S a_S where M_S is the exomoon mass and a_S is the
semi-major axis of the moon's orbit. Therefore, M_S and a_S cannot be
separately determined. We go on to predict a new observable due to exomoons -
transit duration variation (TDV). We derive the TDV amplitude and conclude that
its amplitude is not only detectable, but the TDV signal will provide two
robust advantages: 1) The TDV amplitude is proportional to M_S a_S^{-1/2} and
therefore the ratio of TTV and TDV allows for a separate determination of M_S
and a_S. 2) TDV has a 90 degrees phase difference to the TTV signal, making it
an excellent complementary technique.

angular bias in the least squares timing-based approach that becomes
increasingly relevant for moderate to low signal-to-noise ratios. We show how
estimates of the arrival time uncertainties in each detector can be used to
correct this bias. We also introduce a stand alone parameter estimation
algorithm that can improve the arrival time estimation and provide
root-sum-squared strain amplitude (hrss) values for each site. In the second
part of the paper we discuss how to resolve the directional ambiguity that
arises from observations in three non co-located interferometers between the
true source location and its mirror image across the plane containing the
detectors. We introduce a new, exact relationship among the hrss values at the
three sites that, for sufficiently large signal amplitudes, determines the true
source direction regardless of whether or not the signal is linearly polarized.
Both the algorithm estimating arrival times, arrival time uncertainties, and
hrss values and the directional follow-up can be applied to any set of
gravitational wave candidates observed in a network of three non co-located
interferometers. As a case study we test the methods on simulated waveforms

direction of motion (x-direction) of the sun deviates from unity due to a
tensor potential caused by the black hole existing around the center of the
galaxy. Because the solar system is orbiting around the galactic center at 200
km/s, the theory shows that the Newtonian gravitational potential due to the
sun is not quite radial. At the present time, the ecliptic plane is almost
perpendicular to the galactic plane, consistent with this modification of the
Newtonian gravitational force. The ecliptic plane is assumed to maintain this
orientation in the galactic space as it orbits around the galactic center, but
the rotational angular momentum of the earth around its own axis can be assumed
to be conserved. The earth is between the sun and the galactic center at the
summer solstice all the time. As a consequence, the rotational axis of the
earth would be parallel to the axis of the orbital rotation of the earth 15
million years ago, if the solar system has been orbiting around the galactic
center at 200 km/s. The present theory concludes that the earth did not have
seasons 15 million years ago. Therefore, the water on the earth was accumulated
near the poles as ice and the sea level was very low. Geological evidence
exists that confirms this effect. The resulting global ice-melting started 15
million years ago and is ending now.

  eds. C.J. Benham et al. (Springer, 2008)",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) method has been used to observe and
characterize a variety of protein-DNA interactions including DNA looping and
transcription. TPM experiments exploit the Brownian motion of a DNA-tethered
bead to probe biologically relevant conformational changes of the tether. In
these experiments, a change in the extent of the bead's random motion is used
as a reporter of the underlying macromolecular dynamics and is often deemed
sufficient for TPM analysis. However, a complete understanding of how the
motion depends on the physical properties of the tethered particle complex
would permit more quantitative and accurate evaluation of TPM data. For
instance, such understanding can help extract details about a looped complex
geometry (or multiple coexisting geometries) from TPM data. To better
characterize the measurement capabilities of TPM experiments involving DNA
tethers, we have carried out a detailed calibration of TPM magnitude as a
function of DNA length and particle size. We also explore how experimental
parameters such as acquisition time and exposure time affect the apparent
motion of the tethered particle. We vary the DNA length from 200bp to 2.6kbp
and consider particle diameters of 200, 490 and 970nm. We also present a
systematic comparison between measured particle excursions and theoretical

decay into both radiation and pressureless matter components. We present a
complete set of the exact background and perturbation equations which describe
the evolution of the universe throughout its history. By applying these
equations to the simple but reasonable model of multi-field chaotic inflation,
we explicitly show that the total curvature perturbation is continuously
varying because of the non-adiabatic components of the curvature perturbation
generated by the multiple inflaton fields throughout the whole evolution of the
universe. We also provide an useful analytic estimation of the total as well as
matter and radiation curvature perturbations, assuming that matter is
completely decoupled from radiation from the beginning. The resulting
isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation is at most sub-percent
level when the masses of the inflaton fields are distributed between
$10^{-6}m_{pl}$ and $10^{-5}m_{pl}$. We find that this result is robust unless
we use non-trivial decay rates, and that thus, in general, it is hard to obtain
large matter-radiation isocurvature perturbation. Also, by using the

system. PS1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pi
survey and a medium deep survey (MDS) over 84 sq.deg. We calculate the expected
magnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. We find that, after 3
years, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10
million of which will lie at redshift z>0.9, while the MDS will have detected
over 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z>2. These numbers at least double
if detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. We then evaluate the
accuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-z
code. With the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the
3pi survey of Delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25<z<0.8, which could be reduced by
about 15% using near infrared photometry from the UKIDDS survey, but would
increase by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. For
the MDS an accuracy of Delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02<z<1.5 using
grizy. A dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only red
galaxies. In this case, Delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 million
galaxies at 0.4<z<1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the MDS
at 0.4<z<2. We investigate the effect of using photo-z in the estimate of the
baryonic acoustic oscillation scale. We find that PS1 will achieve a similar

reduce the problem into an integral equation which we then solve numerically.

Monte-Carlo simulations and find very good agreement. Though we have done our

function of inclination. Spiral galaxies in our sample have observed integrated
fractional polarization in the range < 1% to 17.6%. At inclinations less than
50 degrees, the fractional polarization depends mostly on the ratio of random
to regular magnetic field strength. At higher inclinations, Faraday
depolarization associated with the regular magnetic field becomes more
important. The observed degree of polarization is lower (<4%) for more luminous
galaxies, in particular those with L_{4.8} > 2 x 10^{21} W/Hz. The polarization
angle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the
disk for galaxies without a bar. In our axially symmetric models, the
polarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength.
Simulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiral
galaxies at 4.8 GHz and 1.4 GHz are presented. We conclude that polarization
measurements, e.g. with the SKA, of unresolved spiral galaxies allow
statistical studies of the magnetic field in disk galaxies using large samples

idealized background sources without internal Faraday rotation, they can be
used to detect large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium.

Damped Ly Alpha (DLA) systems are inconsistent with these systems originating
in gas disks of galaxies similar to those seen in the local Universe. We
examine the gas kinematics of local galaxies using the high quality HI 21-cm
data from the HI Nearby Galaxies Survey (THINGS) and make a comparison with the
velocity profiles measured in the low-ionization metal lines observed in DLAs
at high redshifts. The median velocity width of z=0 HI gas above the DLA column
density limit of N=2x10^20 cm-2 is approximately 30 km/s, whereas the typical
value in DLAs is a factor of two higher. We argue that the gas kinematics at
higher redshifts are increasingly influenced by gas that is not participating
in ordered rotation in cold disks, but is more likely associated with tidal gas
related to galaxy interactions or processes such as superwinds and outflows. An
analysis of the HI in the local interacting star-burst galaxy M82 shows that
the velocity widths in this galaxy are indeed similar to what is seen in DLAs.

components of the Szeg\""{o} kernel of a polarized complex projective manifold,
and its subsequent generalizations in terms of scaling limits, have played an
important role in algebraic, symplectic, and differential geometry. A natural
question is whether there exist generalizations in which the projector onto the
spaces of holomorphic sections can be replaced by the projector onto more
general (non-complete) linear series. One case that lends itself to such
analysis, and which is natural from the point of view of geometric
quantization, is given by the linear series determined by imposing spectral
bounds on an invariant self-adjoint Toeplitz operator. In this paper we focus
on the asymptotics of the spectral projectors associated to slowly shrinking
spectral bands.

novel resource, to quantum information science. The theory of entanglement
establishes basic laws, such as the non-increase of entanglement under local
operations, that govern its manipulation and aims to draw from them formal
analogies to the second law of thermodynamics. However, while in the second law
the entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible
from another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits
a fundamental irreversibility which prevents the existence of such an order.
  Here we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous
relationship with thermodynamics may be established when one considers all
non-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is
taken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of
entanglement. We show the usefulness of this new approach to general resource
theories and to quantum information theory.

a statistical norm on the states of that system via the optimal bias that can
be achieved in distinguishing the states using measurements from that set
(assuming equal priors). The Holevo-Helstrom theorem says that for the set of
all measurements this norm is the trace norm. For finite dimension any norm is
lower and upper bounded by constant (though dimension dependent) multiples of
the trace norm, so we set ourselves the task of computing or bounding the best
possible ""constants of domination"" for the norms corresponding to various
restricted sets of measurements, thereby determining the worst case and best
case performance of these sets relative to the set of all measurements.
  We look at the case where the allowed set consists of a single measurement,
namely the uniformly random continuous POVM and its approximations by 2-designs
and 4-designs respectively. Here we find asymptotically tight bounds for the
constants of domination.
  Furthermore, we analyse the multipartite setting with any LOCC measurement
allowed. In the case of two parties, we show that the lower domination constant
is the same as that of a tensor product of local uniformly random POVMs (up to
a constant). This answers in the affirmative an open question about the
(near-)optimality of bipartite data hiding: The bias that can be achieved by
LOCC in discriminating two orthogonal states of a d x d bipartite system is
Omega(1/d), which is known to be tight. Finally, we use our analysis to derive
certainty relations (in the sense of Sanchez-Ruiz) for any such measurements
and to lower bound the locally accessible information for bipartite systems.

is based on the synergy between the pinch technique and the background field
method. One of its most powerful features is that the transversality of the
gluon self-energy is manifestly preserved, exactly as dictated by the BRST
symmetry of the theory. We then explain, for the first time in the literature,
how to construct non-perturbatively a renormalization group invariant quantity
out of the conventional gluon propagator. This newly constructed quantity
serves as the natural starting point for defining a non-perturbative effective
charge for QCD, which constitutes, in all respects, the generalization in a
non-Abelian context of the universal QED effective charge. This strong
effective charge displays asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet, while in the
low-energy regime it freezes at a finite value, giving rise to an infrared
fixed point for QCD. Some possible pitfalls related to the extraction of such
an effective charge from infrared finite gluon propagators, such as those found
on the lattice, are briefly discussed.

A comparison with the AT20G Bright Source Sample (Massardi et al. 2008), with a
completeness limit of 0.5 Jy and accurate flux measurements at 20 GHz, close to
the lowest frequency of WMAP maps, has allowed us to assess the completeness
and the reliability of the samples detected with the two approaches, as well as
the accuracy of flux and error estimates, and their variations across the sky.
The uncertainties on flux estimates given by our procedure turned out to be
about a factor of 2 lower than the rms differences with AT20G measurements,
consistent with the smoothing of the fluctuation field yielded by map
filtering. Flux estimates were found to be essentially unbiased except that,
close to the detection limit, a substantial fraction of fluxes are found to be
inflated by the contribution of underlying positive fluctuations. This is
consistent with expectations for the Eddington bias associated to the true
errors on flux density estimates. The blind and non-blind approaches are found
to be complementary: each of them allows the detection of sources missed by the
other. Combining results of the two methods on the WMAP 5-year maps we have
expanded the non-blindly generated New Extragalactic WMAP Point Source (NEWPS)

method. For a given temperature, we plot the chemical potential as a function
of density looking for an ""S-shape"" as a signal for a first order transition.
We carried out simulations using Wilson fermions with $m_\pi \approx 1{GeV}$ on
$6^3\times 4$ lattices. As a benchmark, we ran four flavors simulations where
we observe a clear signal. In the two flavors case we do not see any signal for
temperatures as low as $0.83 T_c$. Preliminary results for the three flavor
case are also presented.

from the solution of the wave equation for triangular cavity. However, the
solution has different selection rules for triangles with armchair and zigzag
edges, and roughly 40000 atoms are needed to see clearly the first supershell
oscillation. In the case of spherical flakes, the edge states of the zigzag
regions dominate the shell structure which is thus sensitive to the flake
diameter and center. A potential well that is made with external gates cannot
have true bound states in graphene due to the zero energy band gap. However, it
can cause strong resonances in the conduction band.

2008, I give my account of the historical development of the MARCS code from
the first version published in 1975 and its premises to the 2008 grid. It is
shown that the primary driver for the development team is the science that can
be done with the models, and that they constantly strive to include the best
possible physical data. A few preliminary comparisons of M star model spectra
to spectrophotometric observations are presented. Particular results related to
opacity effects are discussed. The size of errors in the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and model thermal stratification are estimated for different
densities of the wavelength sampling. The number of points used in the MARCS
2008 grid (108000) is large enough to ensure errors of only a few K in all
models of the grid, except the optically very thin layers of metal-poor stars.
Errors in SEDs may reach about 10% locally in the UV. The published sampled
SEDs are thus appropriate to compute synthetic broad-band photometry, but
higher resolution spectra will be computed in the near future and published as
well on the MARCS site (marcs.astro.uu.se). Test model calculations with TiO
line opacity accounted for in scattering show an important cooling of the upper
atmospheric layers of red giants. Rough estimates of radiative and collisional
time scales for electronic transitions of TiO indicate that scattering may well
be the dominant mechanism in these lines. However models constructed with this
hypothesis are incompatible with optical observations of TiO (Arcturus) or IR
observations of OH (Betelgeuse), although they may succeed in explaining H2O
line observations. More work is needed in that direction.

identified the presence of two distinct universality classes of spatiotemporal

intermittency which does not belong to this class. We show that these two types
of behavior are special cases of a spreading regime where each site can infect
its neighbors permitting an initial disturbance to spread, and a non-spreading
regime where no infection is possible, with the two regimes being separated by
a line, the infection line. The coupled map lattice can be mapped on to an
equivalent cellular automaton which shows a transition from a probabilistic
cellular automaton to a deterministic cellular automaton at the infection line.
The origins of the spreading-non-spreading transition in the coupled map
lattice, as well as the probabilistic to deterministic transition in the
cellular automaton lie in a dynamical phenomenon, an attractor-widening crisis
at the infection line. Indications of unstable dimension variability are seen
in the neighborhood of the infection line. This may provide useful pointers to
the spreading behavior seen in other extended systems.

different relativistic quantum mechanic approaches evidences tremendous
discrepancies. The role of constraints coming from space-time translations is
considered here with this respect. It is known that invariance under these
translations implies the energy-momentum conservation relation that is usually
assumed to hold globally. Transformations of the current under these
translations, which lead to this result, also imply constraints that have been
ignored so far in relativistic quantum mechanic approaches. An implementation
of these constraints is discussed in the case of a model with two scalar
constituents. It amounts to incorporate selected two-body currents to all
orders in the interaction. Discrepancies for form factors in different
approaches can thus be removed, contributing to restore the equivalence of
different approaches. Results for the standard front-form approach ($q^+=0$)
are found to fulfill the constraints and are therefore unchanged. The relation
with results from a dispersion-relation approach is also made.

progressively slowed its fading pace until the decline reversed and a second
maximum was reached (eight months later), accompanied by large spectroscopic

entered the nebular phase and formed optically thin dust. We computed the

Riemannian spacetimes. Subsequently we represent the symmetric teleparallel

lagrangian with lagrange multipliers for vanishing torsion and curvature. We
show that our lagrangian is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian for
certain values of coupling coefficients. Thus we arrive at calculating the

average angular offset between the HI and 24$\mu$m emissivity peaks as a
function of radius, for a sample of 14 nearby disk galaxies. We model these
offsets assuming an instantaneous kinematic pattern speed, $\Omega_p$, and a
timescale, t(HI-->24$\mu$m), for the characteristic time span between the dense
\hi phase and the formation of massive stars that heat the surrounding dust.
Fitting for $\Omega_p$ and t(HI-->24$\mu$m), we find that the radial dependence
of the observed angular offset (of the \hi and 24$\mu$m emission) is consistent
with this simple prescription; the resulting corotation radii of the spiral
patterns are typically $R_{cor}\simeq 2.7 R_{s}$, consistent with independent
estimates. The resulting values of t(HI-->24$\mu$m) for the sample are in the
range 1--4 Myr. We have explored the possible impact of non-circular gas
motions on the estimate of t(HI-->24$\mu$m) and have found it to be
substantially less than a factor of 2. This implies that a short timescale for
the most intense phase of the ensuing star formation in spiral arms, and
implies a considerable fraction of molecular clouds exist only for a few Myr
before forming stars. However, our analysis does not preclude that some
molecular clouds persist considerably longer. If much of the star formation in
spiral arms occurs within this short interval t(HI-->24$\mu$m), then star
formation must be inefficient, in order to avoid the short-term depletion of
the gas reservoir.

${\mathcal M}$ of random operators that generalizes the usual quantum

${\mathcal M_0}$, dense in ${\mathcal M}$, that is isomorphic with the algebra
${\mathcal A}$. This isomorphism allows us to transfer all differentially

the help of ${\mathcal A}$ (and its derivations) to the space ${\mathcal M_0}$.
In this way, we obtain a generalization of general relativity in terms of

cannot be extended to the whole of ${\mathcal M}$, and this is the main
mathematical obstacle, at least in this approach, to fully unify theory of

almost exactly at the hottest point along the cluster isochrone, and the
secondary is a ~7 times fainter main--sequence star. We determine an apparent
cluster distance-modulus of (m-M)_V = 13.46+/-0.10 (average of primary and
secondary). The cluster age is obtained from comparisons with theoretical
isochrones in the mass--radius diagram. Using the isochrones from
Victoria--Regina with [Fe/H] =+0.37 we find 7.7+/-0.5Gyr, whereas the
Yonsei-Yale (Y2) isochrones lead to 8.2+/-0.5Gyr, and BaSTI isochrones to
9.0+/-0.5Gyr. In a mass-radius diagram, the 7.7Gyr VRSS and 9.0Gyr BaSTI
isochrones overlap nearly perfectly despite the age-difference. This model
dependence, which is significantly larger than the precision determined from

theoretical developments and the experimental results for a closely related
hyperkagome system, we have performed neutron diffraction measurements on a
single crystal sample of GGG in an applied magnetic field. The measurements
reveal that the H-T phase diagram of GGG is much more complicated than
previously assumed. The application of an external field at low T results in an
intensity change for most of the magnetic peaks which can be divided into three
distinct sets: ferromagnetic, commensurate antiferromagnetic, and
incommensurate antiferromagnetic. The ferromagnetic peaks (e.g. (112), (440)
and (220)) have intensities that increase with the field and saturate at high
field. The antiferromagnetic reflections have intensities that grow in low
fields, reach a maximum at an intermediate field (apart from the (002) peak
which shows two local maxima) and then decrease and disappear above 2 T. These
AFM peaks appear, disappear and reach maxima in different fields. We conclude
that the competition between magnetic interactions and alternative ground
states prevents GGG from ordering in zero field. It is, however, on the verge
of ordering and an applied magnetic field can be used to crystallise ordered
components. The range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic propagation
vectors found reflects the complex frustration in GGG.

computational approach to a class of quantum field theories. This approach is
based on rewriting the partition function in a representation similar to the
world-line representation and hence we shall call it the ""WL-approach"". This
approach is likely to be more powerful than the conventional approach in some
regions of parameter space, especially in the presence of chemical potentials
or massless fermions. While world-line representations are natural in the
Hamiltonian formulation, they can also be constructed directly in Euclidean
space. We first describe the approach and its advantages by considering the
classical XY model in the presence of a chemical potential. We then argue that,
$CP^{N-1}$ models, models of pions on the lattice and the lattice massless
Thirring model, can all be formulated and solved using the WL-approach. In
particular, we discover that the WL-approach to the Thirring model leads to a
novel determinantal Monte-Carlo algorithm which we call the ""dynamical-bag""
algorithm. Finally, we argue that a simple extension of the WL-approach to
gauge theories leads to a world-sheet, ""WS-approach"", in Abelian Lattice Gauge
theory.

coupled lattice gauge theory model with the same symmetries as two-flavor QCD
but with a much lighter $\sigma$-resonance is different. Our model allows us to
study efficiently the convergence of chiral perturbation theory as a function

the chiral Lagrangian are the same when calculated from the $\epsilon$-regime

chiral perturbation theory predicts the data within 1%. However, for $\xi' >

outburst was observed starting from mid 2007, whose rising phase was
contemporaneous to the optical brightening. A slower flux increase also
affected the higher radio frequencies, the flux enhancement disappearing below
8 GHz. The analysis of the optical-radio correlation and time delays, as well
as the behaviour of the mm light curve, confirm our previous predictions,
suggesting that changes in the jet orientation likely occurred in the last few
years. The historical multiwavelength behaviour indicates that a significant
variation in the viewing angle may have happened around year 2000. Colour
analysis reveals a complex spectral behaviour, which is due to the interplay of
different emission components. All the near-IR spectra show a prominent Halpha
emission line, whose flux appears nearly constant. The analysis of the
XMM-Newton data indicates a correlation between the UV excess and the
soft-X-ray excess, which may represent the head and the tail of the big blue
bump, respectively. The X-ray flux correlates with the optical flux, suggesting
that in the inverse-Compton process either the seed photons are synchrotron
photons at IR-optical frequencies or the relativistic electrons are those that
produce the optical synchrotron emission. The X-ray radiation would thus be
produced in the jet region from where the IR-optical emission comes.

time is obtained through the finite-differences method. It appears this is the
first time a combination of basis set and grid methods has been put forward for
tackling multi-region time-dependent problems. In both regions, a high-order
explicit scheme is employed for the time propagation. While, in a purely
hydrogenic system no approximation is involved due to this separation, in
multi-electron systems the validity and the usefulness of the present method
relies on the basic assumption of R-matrix theory, namely that beyond a certain
distance (encompassing region $I$) a single ejected electron is distinguishable
from the other electrons of the multi-electron system and evolves there (region
II) effectively as a one-electron system. The method is developed in detail for
single active electron systems and applied to the exemplar case of the hydrogen

adatoms. In the case of significant transparency the velocity of a given step
in a given moment is affected by detachment of atoms from rather distant steps
in rather earlier moments. The reason is that the adatom needs time to cross
many steps before attaching to a kink position. The theory of the
crystallization should account for the time dependence of the adatom
concentrations on the terraces. Such a transient growth model is developed here
for the limit of slow kinetics at the steps and fast surface diffusion. The
model accounts for the non-local electromigration of the adatoms. The central
results of this study are: - The vicinal surface with transparent steps is
unstable when the drift velocity of the adatoms multiplied with the relative
deviation of the adatom concentration from equilibrium is larger than the
critical velocity of the steps. - The most unstable mode has a wavelength
(expressed as a number of terraces) which is independent of the surface
orientation (the miscut angle of the vicinal) as well as on the magnitude of
step repulsion and the electromigration force and depends only on the relative
transparency of the steps.

it is to be useful in a real-world application. The repeatability is importand
because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features
which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [Schmid et al 2000]. The
efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined
with further processing can operate at frame rate.
  Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic
for feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector
from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5% of the
available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even
operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115%, SIFT 195%). Second, we generalize
the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss
of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors
based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that
despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our
heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors.
Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces
significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both
very fast and very high quality.

cross section of neutral kaons points to an in-medium modification in the
production. The momentum dependent ratio of cross sections of light and heavy

extract microscopic parameters for each fluctuator, including well asymmetry,

between 5% and 150% of the well asymmetry, and the dipole moments give a

dependences of photoconductivity on film's microstructure, which varies with
changing heat-treatment conditions. The maximum photoconductivity is found for
samples with compact packing of individual grains, which nevertheless are
separated by gaps. Such a microstructure is typical for films heat-treated
during an intermediate (optimal) time. In order to understand whether the
dominant mechanism of charge transfer is identical with the one in
monocrystals, we perform temperature measurements of photoresistance.
Corresponding curves have the same peculiar nonmonotonic shape as in CdSe
monocrystals, from which we conclude that the basic mechanism is also the same.
It is suggested that the optimal heat-treatment time appears as a result of a
competition between two mechanisms: improvement of film's connectivity and its
oxidation. Photoresistance is also measured in vacuum and in helium atmosphere,
which suppress oxygen and water absorption/chemisorption at intergrain
boundaries. We demonstrate that this suppression increases photoconductivity,

are due to interference effects between the orbitally degenerate states.
Further we study the impact of reduced symmetry due to anchor groups or
potential drop over the molecule. We identify in the quasi-degeneracy of the
involved molecular states the necessary condition for the robustness of the
results.

cores inside the bright filaments of the penumbra. Here we present the
stationary solution of the heat transfer equation in a stratified penumbra
consisting of nearly horizontal magnetic flux tubes embedded in a stronger and
more vertical field. The tubes and the external medium are in horizontal
mechanical equilibrium. This model produces bright filaments with dark cores as
a consequence of the higher density of the plasma inside the flux tube, which
shifts the surface of optical depth unity toward higher (cooler) layers. Our
results suggest that the surplus brightness of the penumbra is a natural
consequence of the Evershed flow, and that magnetic flux tubes about 250 km in
diameter can explain the morphology of sunspot penumbra.

demonstrate that in the exotic I=2, I_3=+-2 channels, the leading scaling
violations of pi-pi scattering at maximal twist begin at O(m_pi^2 b^2). This is
not the case in any other isospin channel, for which the scaling violations at
maximal twist begin at O(b^2). Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a
mixing between the I=2, I_3 = 0 and I=0 scattering channels due to the breaking
of isospin symmetry by the twisted mass term. The mixing term, although
formally next-to-leading order, is relatively large, thus necessitating the use
of a coupled channel analysis. We argue that this mixing likely renders the
computation of the I=0 channel impractical with twisted mass lattice QCD.

of Nd(O_0.7F_0.3)FeAs single crystals in strong DC and pulsed magnetic fields
up to 45 T and 60 T, respectively. We found that the field scale of H_c2 is
comparable to ~100 T of high T_c cuprates. H_c2(T) parallel to the c-axis
exhibits a pronounced upward curvature similar to what was extracted from
earlier measurements on polycrystalline samples. Thus this behavior is indeed
an intrinsic feature of oxypnictides, rather than manifestation of vortex
lattice melting or granularity. The orientational dependence of H_c2 shows
deviations from the one-band Ginzburg-Landau scaling. The mass anisotropy
decreases as T decreases, from 9.2 at 44K to 5 at 34K. Spin dependent
magnetoresistance and nonlinearities in the Hall coefficient suggest
contribution to the conductivity from electron-electron interactions modified
by disorder reminiscent that of diluted magnetic semiconductors. The Ohmic
resistivity measured below T_c but above the irreversibility field exhibits a
clear Arrhenius thermally activated behavior over 4-5 decades. The activation
energy has very different field dependencies for H||ab and H\perp ab. We
discuss to what extent different pairing scenarios can manifest themselves in
the observed behavior of H_{c2}, using the two-band model of superconductivity.
The results indicate the importance of paramagnetic effects on H_c2(T),which
may significantly reduce H_c2(0) as compared toH_c2(0)~200-300 T based on
extrapolations of H_c2(T) near T_c down to low temperatures.

substitution is expanding the unit cell and leads to a suppression of the

critical point (QCP) exists. We applied hydrostatic pressure to reverse the
effect of substitution. Our results indicate that Yb(Rh0.94Ir0.06)2Si2 is

has an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments at the Fe atoms, the
doped system becomes non magnetic at a critical electron concentration. We have
studied the electron-phonon interaction in the doped paramagnetic phase. For
the $A_{1g}$ phonon, the separation between the As and Fe planes induces a
non-collinear arrangement of the Fe magnetic moments. This arrangement is anti
parallel for interactions mediated by As, and perpendicular for Fe-Fe direct
interactions, thus avoiding frustration. This coupling of magnetism with
vibrations induces anharmonicities and an electron-phonon interaction much
larger than in the pure paramagnetic case. We propose that such enhanced
interactions play an essential role in superconducting compounds close to an
atiferromagnetic phase transition.
