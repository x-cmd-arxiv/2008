studied using direct numerical simulations. The resulting magnetic field
displays propagating wave-like behavior. This behavior can be modelled in terms
of an \alpha\Omega dynamo. In most cases super-equipartition fields are
generated. By varying the fraction of helicity of the turbulence the
regeneration of poloidal fields via the helicity effect (corresponding to the
\alpha-effect) is regulated. The saturation level of the magnetic field in the
numerical models is consistent with a linear dependence on the ratio of the
fractional helicities of the small and large-scale fields, as predicted by a
simple nonlinear mean-field model. As the magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) based
on the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies is increased from 1 to 180, the
cycle frequency of the large-scale field is found to decrease by a factor of
about 6 in cases where the turbulence is fully helical. This is interpreted in
terms of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity, which is found to be only weakly
dependent on Rm.

Our interferometer sorts HG_nm input modes depending upon whether they have
even or odd order n+m; it equivalently sorts LG modes depending upon whether
they have an even or odd value of their orbital angular momentum. It functions
efficiently at the single-photon level, and therefore can be used to sort
single-photon states. Due to the inherent phase stability of this type of
interferometer as compared to those of the Mach-Zehnder type, it provides a
promising tool for the manipulation and filtering of higher order transverse
spatial modes for the purposes of quantum information processing. For example,
several similar Sagnacs cascaded together may allow, for the first time, a
stable measurement of the orbital angular momentum of a true single-photon
state. Furthermore, as an alternative to well-known holographic techniques, one
can use the Sagnac in conjunction with a multi-mode fiber as a spatial mode
filter, which can be used to produce spatial-mode entangled Bell states and
heralded single photons in arbitrary first-order (n+m=1) spatial states,
covering the entire Poincare sphere of first-order transverse modes.

this formula; this factor is non-trivial in general and is related to certain

techniques of visibility to show that, under certain hypotheses (which includes
the first part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture on rank), if an odd

monitoring and multi-color optical follow-up observations of GRB 080319B
collected by the RAPTOR telescope network covering the development of the

bright prompt optical emission revealed features that are normally not
detectable. The optical and gamma-ray variability during the explosion are
correlated, but the optical flux is much greater than can be reconciled with
single emission mechanism and a flat gamma-ray spectrum. This extreme optical
behavior is best understood as synchrotron self-Compton model (SSC). After a
gradual onset of the gamma-ray emission, there is an abrupt rise of the prompt
optical flux suggesting that variable self-absorption dominates the early
optical light curve. Our simultaneous multi-color optical light curves
following the flash show spectral evolution consistent with a rapidly decaying
red component due to large angle emission and the emergence of a blue forward
shock component from interaction with the surrounding environment. While
providing little support for the reverse shock that dominates the early
afterglow, these observations strengthen the case for the universal role of the
SSC mechanism in generating gamma-ray bursts.

a shortest path. The situation in a context of perfect information is a
so-called Nash equilibrium, and the question whether there is such an
equilibrium and of finding it if it exists is the so-called equilibrium
assignment problem. It arises for various kind of networks, such as computers,
communication or transportation network. When each user occupies permanently
the whole route from the origin to its destination, we call it the static
assignment problem, which has been extensively studied with pioneers works by
Wardrop or Beckmann. A less studied, but more realistic, and maybe more

deviation of the magnetization cycle from a reversible function into an opened

Ru$_2$), the zero-field level repulsion was sufficiently large to ensure an
otherwise adiabatic passage through zero-field and the magnetization curves can
be described by using only a phonon-bottleneck model. Here, we generalize the
phonon-bottleneck model into a model able to blend the non-adiabatic dynamics
of spins with the presence of a non-equilibrium phonon bath. In this simple
phenomenological model, Bloch equations are written in the eigenbasis of the
effective spin Hamiltonian, considered to be a two-level system at low
temperatures. The relaxation term is given by the phonon-bottleneck mechanism.
To the expense of calculus time, the method can be generalized to multi-level
systems, where the notion of Bloch sphere does not apply but the density matrix
formalism is still applicable.

the Smoluchowski equation of interacting Brownian particles in a given shear
flow, derives generalized Green-Kubo relations, which contain the transients
dynamics formally exactly, and closes the equations using mode coupling
approximations. Shear thinning of colloidal fluids and dynamical yielding of
colloidal glasses arise from a competition between a slowing down of structural
relaxation, because of particle interactions, and enhanced decorrelation of
fluctuations, caused by the shear advection of density fluctuations. The
integration through transients approach takes account of the dynamic
competition, translational invariance enters the concept of wavevector
advection, and the mode coupling approximation enables to quantitatively
explore the shear-induced suppression of particle caging and the resulting
speed-up of the structural relaxation. Extended comparisons with shear stress
data in the linear response and in the nonlinear regime measured in model
thermo-sensitive core-shell latices are discussed. Additionally, the single

spheres were modeled using inverse power potentials ($V\sim r^{-n}$, with $1/n$
the potential softness). Although the pressure, diffusion coefficient and
viscosity depend at constant density on the particle softness up to extremely
high values of $n$, we show that scaling the density with the freezing point
for every system effectively collapses these parameters for $n\geq 18$
(including hard spheres), for large densities. At the freezing points, the long
range structure of all systems is identical, when the distance is measured in
units of the interparticle distance, but differences appear at short distances
(due to the different shape of the interaction potential). This translates into
differences at short times in the velocity and stress autocorrelation
functions, although they concur to give the same value of the corresponding
transport coefficient (for the same density to freezing ratio); the microscopic
dynamics also affects the short time behaviour of the correlation functions and
absolute values of the transport coefficients, but the same scaling with the
freezing density works for Newtonian or Brownian dynamics. For hard spheres,
the short time behaviour of the stress autocorrelation function has been
studied in detail, confirming quantitatively the theoretical forms derived for
it.

incorporates the absorbed heat from a single beam or interfering beams is
solved analytically. Using this temperature field, we derive the 3D long-wave
evolution PDE for the film height. To get insights into dynamics of dewetting,
we study the 2D version of the evolution equation by means of a linear
stability analysis and by numerical simulations. The stabilizing and
destabilizing effects of various system parameters, such as the peak laser beam
intensity, the film optical thickness, the Biot and Marangoni numbers, etc. are
elucidated. It is observed that the film stability is promoted for such
parameters variations that increase the heat production in the film. In the
numerical simulations the impacts of different irradiation modes are
investigated. In particular, we obtain that in the interference heating mode
the spatially periodic irradiation results in a spatially periodic film rupture
with the same, or nearly equal period. The 2D model qualitatively reproduces
the results of the experimental observations of a film stability and spatial
ordering of a re-solidified nanostructures.

Under the assumption of axisymmetry, the step radii satisfy a system of ODEs

interactions. Two main problems arise in the numerical solution of these
equations. First, the trajectory of the innermost step can become singular,
resulting in a divergent step velocity. Second, when a step bunching
instability arises, the motion of steps within a bunch becomes very strongly
stable, resulting in ""local stiffness"". The multirate method introduced in this
paper ensures that small time steps are taken for singular and locally stiff
components, while larger time steps are taken for the remaining ones. Special
consideration is given to the construction of high order interpolants during
run time which ensures fourth order accuracy of scheme for components of the

The estimated star formation rates range from 500 to 3000Msun/yr. The AGN
near-infrared and X ray emissions are heavily obscured in both sources with an
estimated dust extinction Av>4, and Compton-thick gas column densities. The two
sources are the most obscured and most luminous AGNs detected at millimeter

obscured QSOs, but their properties are not fully explained by the standard AGN
unification model. In one source, the ultraviolet and optical spectra suggest
the presence of outflowing gas and shocks, and both sources show emission from
hot dust, most likely in the vicinity of the nucleus. Evidence of moderate
AGN-driven radio activity is found in both sources. The two sources lie on the
local M_BH-M_bulge relation. To remain on this relation, their star formation

localized state (c-state) of a quantum dot and a Fermi sea conduction band, is
investigated. We demonstrate that, as a function of the hybridization parameter
v, the system undergoes a crossover from the state where the conduction band
and the c-level are fully coupled to a state where these are decoupled. The
c-electron spectrum, however, has a gap together with the presence of the Kondo
peak in the former state. For the latter, we have a Mott-like localization
where the c-electron spectrum again has a gap without the Kondo peak. Within
this gap the conduction electrons fully recover the free band density of states
and the effective hybridization is practically zero. Our main aim, however, is
to study the emission and absorption in a quantum dot with strongly correlated
Kondo ground state. We use the Green function equation of motion method for
this purpose. We calculate the absorption/emission (A/E) spectrum in the Kondo
regime through a symmetrized quantum autocorrelation function obtainable
directly within perturbation theory using the Fermi golden rule approximation.
The spectrum reveals a sharp, tall peak close to Kondo-Abrikosov-Suhl peak and
a few smaller, distinguishable ones on either side. The former clearly
indicates that the Kondo phenomenon has its impact on A/E (non-Kondo
processes), which are driven by the coupling involving the dipole moment of
quantum dot transitions reflecting the physical structure of the dot including
the confinement potential, in the Kondo regime.

significant changes in different parts of the cavity during each round-trip.
The dynamics of such pulses is therefore not adequately described by an average
model that does not take such changes into account. The purpose of this work is
severalfold. First we introduce the dispersion-managed Ginzburg-Landau equation
(DMGLE) as an average model that describes the long-term dynamics of systems
characterized by rapid variations of dispersion, nonlinearity and gain in a
general setting, and we study the properties of the equation. We then explain
how in particular the DMGLE arises for Ti:sapphire femtosecond lasers and we
characterize its solutions. In particular, we show that, for moderate values of

those of the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DMNLSE), and
the main effect of gain and loss dynamics is simply to select one among the

orthogonal to each other. A general shadow-fading model, described by
parameters $(\alpha,\varpi)$, is considered where $\alpha$ denotes the

throughput in the asymptotic regime of $K \to \infty$, which is achieved by: i)
proposing a distributed and non-iterative power allocation strategy, where the
objective of each user is to maximize its best estimate (based on its local

ii) choosing the optimum value for $M$. In the first part of the paper, the
network hroughput is defined as the \textit{average sum-rate} of the network,

the strong interference scenario, the optimum power allocation strategy for
each user is a threshold-based on-off scheme. In the second part, the network
throughput is defined as the \textit{guaranteed sum-rate}, when the outage
probability approaches zero. In this scenario, it is demonstrated that the
on-off power allocation scheme maximizes the throughput, which scales as
$\frac{W}{\alpha \varpi} \log K$. Moreover, the optimum spectrum sharing for

$LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_x$, enormous interests have been stimulated in the fields of
condensed matter physics and material sciences. Among the five different
structures in this broad type of superconductors\cite{2,3,4,5,6}, the ZrCuSiAs
structure has received special attention since the $T_c$ has been quickly
promoted to 55-56 K\cite{7,8,9,10,11} in fluorine doped oxy-pnictides REFeAsO
(RE = rare earth elements). The superconductivity can also be induced by
applying a high pressure to the undoped samples\cite{12,13}. The mechanism of
superconductivity in the FeAs-based system remains unclear yet, but it turns
out to be clear that any change to the structure or the building blocks will
lead to a change of the superconducting transition temperatures. In this
Letter, we report the fabrication of the new family of compounds, namely
fluorine-arsenides DvFeAsF (Dv = divalent metals) with the ZrCuSiAs structure
and with the new building block DvF instead of the REO (both the layers DvF and
REO have the combined cation state of ""+1""). The undoped parent phase has a
Spin-Density-Wave like transition at about 173 K for SrFeAsF, 118 K for CaFeAsF
and 153 K for EuFeAsF. By doping electrons into the system the resistivity
anomaly associated with this SDW transition is suppressed and superconductivity
appears at 32 K in the fluorine-arsenide Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$FeAsF (x = 0.4). Our
discovery here initiates a new method to obtain superconductors in the
FeAs-based system.

  & Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200810481",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CONTEXT: Spectral-line asymmetries and wavelength shifts are signatures of
hydrodynamics in solar and stellar atmospheres. Theory may precisely predict
idealized lines, but observed spectra are limited by blends, too few suitable
lines, imprecise laboratory wavelengths, and by instrumental imperfections.
  AIMS: Bisectors and shifts are extracted until the 'ultimate' accuracy limits
in highest-quality solar and stellar spectra, to understand limits set by
stellar physics, observational techniques, and limitations in laboratory data.
  METHODS: Spectral atlases of the Sun and bright solar-type stars were
examined for thousands of 'unblended' lines with the most accurate laboratory
wavelengths, yielding bisectors and shifts as averages over groups of similar
lines, thus minimizing effects of photometric noise and of random blends.
  RESULTS: For solar spectra, bisector shapes and shifts were extracted for
previously little-studied species (Fe II, Ti I, Ti II, Cr II, Ca I, C I), using
recently determined very accurate laboratory wavelengths. In Procyon and other
F-type stars, a blueward bend in the bisector near the spectral continuum
reveals line saturation and damping wings in upward-moving photospheric
granules. Accuracy limits set by 'astrophysical' noise, finite instrumental
resolution, superposed telluric absorption, and inaccurate wavelengths,
together limit absolute lineshift studies to approximately 50-100 m/s.
  CONCLUSIONS: Spectroscopy with resolutions R = 300,000 will enable bisector
studies for many stars. Circumventing remaining limits of astrophysical noise
in line-blends and rotationally smeared profiles may ultimately require
spectroscopy across spatially resolved stellar disks.

pseudobulges that often are mistaken for true (merger-built) bulges. Many
pseudobulges are recognizable as cold, rapidly rotating, disky structures.
Bulges have Sersic function brightness profiles with index n > 2; most
pseudobulges have n <= 2. Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem
with cold dark matter galaxy formation more acute: How can hierarchical
clustering make so many pure disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built
bulges? E. g., the giant Scd galaxies M101 and NGC 6946 have rotation
velocities of V ~ 200 km/s but nuclear star clusters with velocity dispersions
of 25 to 40 km/s. Within 8 Mpc of us, 11 of 19 galaxies with V > 150 km/s show
no evidence for a classical bulge, while only 7 are ellipticals or have
classical bulges. It is hard to understand how bulgeless galaxies could form as
the quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories. Our second theme is
environmental secular evolution. We confirm that spheroidal galaxies have
fundamental plane (FP) correlations that are almost perpendicular to those for
bulges and ellipticals. Spheroidals are not dwarf ellipticals. Rather, their
structural parameters are similar to those of late-type galaxies. We suggest
that spheroidals are defunct late-type galaxies transformed by internal
processes such as supernova-driven gas ejection and environmental processes
such as secular harassment and ram-pressure stripping. Minus spheroidals, the
FP of ellipticals and bulges has small scatter. With respect to these,
pseudobulges are larger and less dense.

star (NS)-NS and black hole-NS binaries. Initially, such hyper-accreting disks
cool efficiently by neutrino emission and their composition is driven
neutron-rich by pair captures under degenerate conditions. However, as the disk
viscously spreads and its temperature drops, cooling becomes inefficient and
the disk becomes advective. Analytic arguments and numerical simulations
suggest that once this occurs, powerful winds likely drive away most of the
disk's remaining mass. We calculate the thermal evolution and nuclear
composition of viscously spreading accretion disks formed from compact object
mergers using one-dimensional height-integrated simulations. We show that
freeze-out from weak equilibrium necessarily accompanies the disk's late-time
transition to an advective state. As a result, hyper-accreting disks
generically freeze out neutron-rich (with electron fraction Ye ~ 0.2-0.4), and
their late-time outflows robustly synthesize rare neutron-rich isotopes. Using
the measured abundances of these isotopes in our solar system, we constrain the
compact object merger rate in the Milky Way to be < 1e-5 (M_d,0/0.1 Msun)^(-1)
per year, where M_d,0 is the average initial mass of the accretion disk. Thus,
either the NS-NS merger rate is at the low end of current estimates or the
average disk mass produced during a typical merger is << 0.1 Msun. We also show
that if most short duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by compact
object mergers, their beaming fraction must exceed f_b ~ 0.13(M_d,0/0.1 Msun),
corresponding to a jet half-opening angle > 30(M_d,0/0.1 Msun)^(1/2) degrees.
This is consistent with other evidence that short duration GRB outflows are
less collimated than those produced in long duration GRBs.

galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation
law differs between the H2-dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their
HI-dominated outskirts and the HI-rich late-type/dwarf galaxies.
  We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N=1.0+-0.2 relates the SFR
SD and the H2 SD across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms
stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion
time is ~2*10^9 yrs. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion
time as evidence that stars are forming in GMCs with approximately uniform
properties and that the H2 SD may be more a measure of the filling fraction of
giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas.
  The relationship between total gas SD and SFR SD varies dramatically among
and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between
the HI SD and the SFR SD. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR
SD / gas SD) varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies.
We show that in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf
galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical
disks of the spirals. Another general feature of our sample is a sharp
saturation of the HI SD at ~9 M_sol/pc^2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies.

in the spectrum of this Seyfert-2 galaxy; a weak, narrow fluorescent-Kalpha
emission line of cold iron is robustly detected in both the Suzaku and
XMM-Newton spectra but at a level much below that of most other Seyfert-2

""clean"" and lacks the Compton-thick obscuring torus of unified Seyfert schemes.
  From the narrowness of the iron line, together with evidence for line flux
variability between the Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations, we constrain the
line emitting region to be between $3\times 10^3r_g$ and $4\times 10^4r_g$ from
the black hole. We show that the observed properties of the iron line can be
explained if the line originates from the surface layers of a warped accretion
disk. In particular, we present explicit calculations of the expected iron line
from a disk warped by Lens-Thirring precession from a misaligned central black
hole. Finally, the Suzaku data reveal clear evidence for large amplitude
2-10keV variability on timescales of 50ksec as well as smaller amplitude flares

processes, such rapid variability requires an origin in the innermost regions

distance for early-A to K4 stars extracted from the IPHAS $r'/i'/\Halpha$
photometric database. These data can be binned up to map extinction in three
dimensions across the northern Galactic Plane. The large size of the IPHAS
database ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digital
photometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allow
extinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance
($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the Solar
Circle. High reddening within the Solar Circle on occasion brings this range
down to $\sim 2$ kpc. The resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatly
exceeds that of previous empirical 3D extinction maps, enabling the structure
of the Galactic Plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}
accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,
unresolved ISM substructure, and binarity. The impact of metallicity
variations, within the range typical of the Galactic disc is small. The
accuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use of
simulated photometry created with Monte-Carlo sampling techniques. The success
of this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results are
compared to the literature.

De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich semi-analytic model built upon the
millennium dark matter simulation. This is achieved by applying a Monte Carlo
Markov Chain method to constrain the 6 free parameters that define the stellar
and black-hole mass functions at redshift zero. The model is tested against
three different observational data sets, including the galaxy K-band luminosity
function, B-V colours, and the black hole-bulge mass relation, separately and
combined, to obtain mean values, confidence limits and likelihood contours for
the best fit model. Using each observational data set independently, we discuss
how the SA model parameters affect each galaxy property and to what extent the
correlations between them can lead to improved understandings of the physics of
galaxy formation. When all the observations are combined, we find reasonable
agreement between the majority of the previously published parameter values and
our confidence limits. However, the need to suppress dwarf galaxy formation
requires the strength of the supernova feedback to be significantly higher in
our best-fit solution than in previous work. To balance this, we require the
feedback to become ineffective in halos of lower circular velocity than before,
so as to permit the formation of sufficient high-luminosity galaxies:
unfortunately, this leads to an excess of galaxies around L*. Although the
best-fit is formally consistent with the data, there is no region of parameter
space that reproduces the shape of galaxy luminosity function across the whole
magnitude-range. We discuss modifications to the semi-analytic model that might
simultaneously improve the fit to the observed luminosity function and reduce
the reliance on excessive supernova feedback in small halos.

km/sec and phased with the motion of the secondary star, the other having
little or no detectable radial velocity variations. We attribute the central
line component to gas near the coupling region, perhaps with a contribution
from irradiation of the secondary star. The two satellite components have RV
offsets of ~+/-250 km/sec on either side of the central strong H-alpha peak.
These satellites most likely arise in large loops of magnetically confined gas
near the secondary star due to magnetic activity on the donor star and/or

these two satellite features have concentrations at velocities that match the

maps from HERACLES and BIMA SONG CO. We estimate the star formation rate by
combining GALEX FUV maps and SINGS 24 micron maps, infer stellar surface
density profiles from SINGS 3.6 micron data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We
measure the SFE as a function of: the free-fall and orbital timescales;
midplane gas pressure; stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the
effects of stars); the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear; and the
ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly
constant at 5.25 +/- 2.5 x 10^(-10) yr^(-1) (equivalent to an H2 depletion time
of 1.9x10^9 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc
resolution. Where the ISM is mostly HI, on the other hand, the SFE decreases
with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably
described by an exponential with scale length 0.2-0.25 r_25. We interpret this
decline as a strong dependence of GMC formation on environment. The ratio of H2
to HI appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and
pressure spanning from the H2-dominated to HI-dominated ISM. The radial decline
in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or
orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are
stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE.
We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe - phase balance in
the HI, H2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback - governs the
formation of GMCs from HI.

consist of simple stellar populations. This picture has been further
complicated by recent studies of the LMC intermediate-age clusters, where the
MSTO was found to be bimodal or broadened. We have undertaken a study of
archival HST images of LMC and SMC clusters with the aim of measuring the
frequency of clusters with evidence of multiple or prolonged star formation
events and determining their main properties. In this paper, we analyse the CMD
of 16 intermediate-age LMC clusters. We find that 11 clusters show an anomalous
spread (or split) in color and magnitude around the MSTO. We demonstrate that
the observed feature is unequivocally associated to the clusters and that it is
not an artifact due to photometric errors, differential reddening or binaries.
We confirm that NGC 1806 and NGC 1846 clearly exhibit two distinct MSTOs and
observe, for the first time, a double MSTO in NGC 1751. In these three clusters
the population corresponding to the brighter MSTO includes more than two-thirds
of cluster stellar population. We confirm the presence of multiple stellar
populations in NGC 1783 and suggest that the MSTO of this cluster is formed by
two distinct branches. In 7 clusters (ESO057-SC075, HODGE7, NGC1852, NGC1917,
NGC1987, NGC2108, and NGC2154) we observed an intrinsic broadening of the MSTO
that may suggest that these clusters have experienced a prolonged period of
star formation (150-250 Myr). The CMDs of IC2146, NGC1644, NGC1652, NGC1795 and
NGC1978 show no evidence of spread or bimodality. In summary 70$\pm$25% of our

black hole (~10^8.8 solar masses) ejected at high speed from the host galactic
nucleus by gravitational radiation recoil, or alternatively for a supermassive
black hole binary. This is based on a blueshift of 2650 km/s of the broad
emission lines (""b-system"") relative to the narrow emission lines (""r-system"")
presumed to reflect the galaxy velocity. New observations with the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope (HET) confirm the essential features of the spectrum. We note a third
redshift system, characterized by weak, narrow emission lines of [O III] and [O
II] at an intermediate velocity 900 km/s redward of the broad line velocity
(""i-system""). A composite spectrum of SDSS QSOs similar to J0927 illustrates
the feasibility of detecting the calcium K absorption line in spectra of
sufficient quality. The i-system may represent the QSO host galaxy or a
companion. Photoionization requires the black hole to be ~3 kpc from the
r-system emitting gas, implying that we are observing the system only 10^6 yr
after the recoil event and contributing to the low probability of observing
such a system. The HET observations give an upper limit of 10 km/s per year on
the rate of change of the velocity difference between the r- and b-systems,
constraining the orbital phase in the binary model. These considerations and
the presence of a cluster of galaxies apparently containing J0927 favor the
idea that this system represents a superposition of two AGN.

RG for the ground states of ""matrix-product-state"" (MPS) Hamiltonians
constructed by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 110403 (2006)] that possess
quantum phase transitions. We find that near critical points, the ground-state
entanglement exhibits singular behavior. The singular behavior within finite
steps of RG obeys a scaling hypothesis and reveals the correlation length
exponent. However, under the infinite steps of RG transformation, the singular
behavior is rendered different and is universal only when there is an
underlying conformal-field-theory description of the critical point.

simulated survey to study the relation between density enhancements in the
distribution of i-dropouts and Lya-emitters, and their relation to the most
massive halos and protocluster regions at z~6. Our simulation predicts
significant variations in surface density across the sky with some voids and
filaments extending over scales of 1 degree, much larger than probed by current
surveys. Approximately one third of all z~6 halos hosting i-dropouts brighter
than z=26.5 mag (~M* at z=6) become part of z=0 galaxy clusters. i-dropouts
associated with protocluster regions are found in regions where the surface
density is enhanced on scales ranging from a few to several tens of arcminutes
on the sky. We analyze two structures of i-dropouts and Lya-emitters observed
with the Subaru Telescope and show that these structures must be the seeds of
massive clusters-in-formation. In striking contrast, six z~6 QSO fields
observed with HST show no significant enhancements in their i-dropout number
counts. With the present data, we cannot rule out the QSOs being hosted by the
most massive halos. However, neither can we confirm this widely used
assumption. We conclude by giving detailed recommendations for the
interpretation and planning of observations by current and future ground- and

to classical codes over quadratic extension fields, provides many new

establishes a close link between subsystem codes and classical codes showing
that the subsystem codes can be constructed from arbitrary classical codes.

depolarizing channel. It gives systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum

onto a protoplanetary system are investigated using 3D hydrodynamical
simulations. The local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk is
considered with sufficient spatial resolution: the region from outside the Hill
sphere to the Jovian radius is covered by the nested-grid method. To
investigate the thermal effects of the circumplanetary disk, various equations
of state are adopted. Large thermal energy around the protoplanet slightly
changes the structure of the circumplanetary disk. Compared with a model
adopting an isothermal equation of state, in a model with an adiabatic equation
of state, the protoplanet's gas envelope extends farther, and a slightly thick
disk appears near the protoplanet. However, different equations of state do not
affect the acquisition process of angular momentum for the protoplanetary
system. Thus, the specific angular momentum acquired by the system is fitted as
a function only of the protoplanet's mass. A large fraction of the total
angular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. The
disk forms only in a compact region in very close proximity to the protoplanet.
Adapting the results to the solar system, the proto-Jupiter and Saturn have
compact disks in the region of r < 21 r_J (r < 0.028 r_HJ) and r < 66 r_S (r <
0.061 r_HS), respectively, where r_J (r_HJ) and r_S (r_HS) are the Jovian and
Saturnian (Hill) radius, respectively. The surface density has a peak in these
regions due to the balance between centrifugal force and gravity of the
protoplanet. The size of these disks corresponds well to the outermost orbit of
regular satellites around Jupiter and Saturn. Regular satellites may form in
such compact disks around proto-gas giant planets.

required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors,
such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a
time. This allows for the use of standard fault tolerance techniques, and shows
that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using
realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high
entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per
photon of less than 0.2%. For quantum dot sources the method has the added
advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons
from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.

extreme carbon stars. We have selected a subset of these stars with absorption
features in the 10-13 $\mu$m range, which has been tentatively attributed to
silicon carbide (SiC). We add three new objects meeting these criterion to the
seven previously known, bringing our total sample to ten sources. We also
present the result of radiative transfer modeling for these stars, comparing
these results to those of previous studies. In order to constrain model
parameters, we use published mass-loss rates, expansion velocities and
theoretical dust condensation models to determine the dust condensation
temperature. These show that the inner dust temperatures of the dust shells for
these sources are significantly higher than previously assumed. This also
implies that the dominant dust species should be graphite instead of amorphous
carbon. In combination with the higher condensation temperature we show that
this results in a much higher acceleration of the dust grains than would be
expected from previous work. Our model results suggest that the very optically
thick stage of evolution does not coincide with the timescales for the
superwind, but rather, that this is a very short-lived phase. Additionally, we
compare model and observational parameters in an attempt to find any
correlations. Finally, we show that the spectrum of one source, IRAS
17534$-$3030, strongly implies that the 10-13 $\mu$m feature is due to a solid
state rather than a molecular species.

[Lindblad H., Commun. Math. Phys. 260 (2005), 319-392] for the isentropic Euler
equations and extend it to the case of full gas dynamics. For technical
simplicity we consider the case of an unbounded domain whose boundary has the
form of a graph and make short comments about the case of a bounded domain. We
prove the local-in-time existence in Sobolev spaces by the technique applied
earlier to weakly stable shock waves and characteristic discontinuities. It
contains, in particular, the reduction to a fixed domain, using the ""good
unknown"" of Alinhac, and a suitable Nash-Moser-type iteration scheme. A certain
modification of such an approach is caused by the fact that the symbol
associated to the free surface is not elliptic. This approach is still directly
applicable to the relativistic version of our problem in the setting of special
relativity and we briefly discuss its extension to general relativity.

valence electrons determine stability and shape of the clusters. The ionic
skeleton of alkali metals is soft, and cluster geometries are often solely
determined by electron correlations. In quantum dots and rings, the electrons
may be confined by an external electrostatic potential, formed by a gated
heterostructure. In the low density limit, the electrons may form so-called
Wigner molecules, for which the many-body quantum spectra reveal the classical
vibration modes. High rotational states increase the tendency for the electrons
to localize. At low angular momenta, the electrons may form a quantum Hall
liquid with vortices. In this case, the vortices act as quasi-particles with
long-range effective interactions that localize in a vortex molecule, in much
analogy to the electron localization at strong rotation.

This makes it possible then to evaluate the need for alternative updating
parameters in the updating of the initial FE model. The model evidences are
compared using the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of evidences. The Jeffrey
scale is used to determine the differences in the models. The Bayesian evidence
is calculated by integrating the likelihood of the data given the model and its
parameters over the a priori model parameter space using the new nested
sampling algorithm. The nested algorithm samples this likelihood distribution
by using a hard likelihood-value constraint on the sampling region while
providing the posterior samples of the updating model parameters as a

seen in extinction out to 1.5 R\_25, approximately six half-light radii. This

extinction law inferred from these measures is similar to the local Milky Way

dataset ideal to analyze this pair with three separate approaches to
overlapping galaxies: (A) a combined fit, rotating copies of both galaxies, (B)
a simple flip of the background image and (C) an estimate of the original

mutations, is critical to the understanding of evolution as phenotypically
expressed genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection. The origin of
genetic robustness, whether it evolves directly by natural selection or it is a
correlated byproduct of other phenotypic traits, is, however, unresolved.
Examining microRNA (miRNA) genes of several eukaryotic species, Borenstein and
Ruppin (Borenstein et al. 2006, PNAS 103: 6593), showed that the structure of
miRNA precursor stem-loops exhibits significantly increased mutational
robustness in comparison with a sample of random RNA sequences with the same
stem-loop structure. The observed robustness was found to be uncorrelated with
traditional measures of environmental robustness -- implying that miRNA
sequences show evidence of the direct evolution of genetic robustness. These
findings are surprising as theoretical results indicate that the direct
evolution of robustness requires high mutation rates and/or large effective
population sizes only found among RNA viruses, not multicellular eukaryotes.
Introducing a novel measure of environmental robustness based on the
equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble of secondary structures of the miRNA
precursor sequences we demonstrate that the biophysics of RNA folding, induces
a high level of correlation between genetic (mutational) and environmental
(thermodynamic) robustness, as expected from the theory of plastogenetic
congruence introduced by Ancel and Fontana (Ancel et al. 2000, J. Exp. Zool.
288: 242). In light of theoretical considerations we believe that this
correlation strongly suggests that genetic robustness observed in miRNA
sequences is the byproduct of selection for environmental robustness.

resolution VLT/UVES echelle spectra of the ejecta-ring collision of SN 1987A.
The fluxes of most of the narrow lines from the unshocked gas decreased by a
factor of 2-3 during this period, consistent with the decay from the initial
ionization by the shock break-out. However, [O III] in particular shows an
increase up to day ~6800. This agrees with radiative shock models where the
pre-shocked gas is heated by the soft X-rays from the shock. The line emission
from the shocked gas increases rapidly as the shock sweeps up more gas. We find
that the neutral and high ionization lines follow the evolution of the Balmer
lines roughly, while the intermediate ionization lines evolve less rapidly. Up
to day ~6800, the optical light curves have a similar evolution to that of the
soft X-rays. The break between day 6500 and day 7000 for [O III] and [Ne III]
is likely due to recombination to lower ionization levels. Nevertheless, the
evolution of the [Fe XIV] line, as well as the lines from the lowest ionization
stages, continue to follow that of the soft X-rays, as expected. There is a
clear difference in the line profiles between the low and intermediate
ionization lines, and those from the coronal lines at the earlier epochs. This
shows that these lines arise from regions with different physical conditions,
with at least a fraction of the coronal lines coming from adiabatic shocks. At
later epochs the line widths of the low ionization lines, however, increase and
approach those of the high ionization lines of [Fe X-XIV]. The H-alpha line
profile can be traced up to ~500 km/s at the latest epoch. This is consistent
with the cooling time of shocks propagating into a density of (1-4)x10^4 cm-3.

critically affect the structure of open clusters (OCs), to the point that most
dissolve into the field in a time-scale shorter than $\approx1$ Gyr. In this
paper we focus on 4 candidate old star clusters, namely, LK 1, LK 10, FSR 1521,
and FSR 1555. To analyse the target clusters we construct near infrared
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and derive stellar radial density profiles
(RDPs). The CMDs are constructed using 2MASS \jj, \hh, and \ks bands, and the
intrinsic morphologies of the target OCs within these diagrams are revealed by
applying a field-star decontamination algorithm. Fundamental parameters are
estimated with Padova isochrones built for the 2MASS filters. We derive
extinctions to the objects within the range $3.4\le\aV\le8.9$, which makes them
suitable for the near-infrared analysis, ages within $1.0 - 2.0$ Gyr, and
distances from the Sun within $1.4 - 4.5$ kpc. These distances, in conjunction
with the positions in the sky, place the present 4 OCs close to the solar
circle ($\la0.6$ kpc). For LK 10 our photometry reaches a depth $\approx3$ mags
below the main sequence turn off, from which we derive a relatively steep mass
function slope ($\chi=2.4\pm0.4$) when compared to the Salpeter value
($\chi=1.35$). LK 10 is a rather massive old OC, with a mass within $1360\le
m(\ms)\le4400$, for stars in the observed magnitude range and the extrapolation
to $0.08 \ms$, respectively. The mass estimated in the restricted magnitude
range for the remaining, more distant OCs is within $260\le m(\ms)\le380$.
However, similarity with the CMD morphology and red clump of LK 10 suggests
that they may be as massive as LK 10.

backbone monomer displacements by virtue of the combination of the adaptive
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) and classical
molecular dynamics (MD). We find that after a smooth turn-on of the external
electric field the polaron is accelerated at first and then moves with a nearly
constant velocity as one entity consisting of both the charge and the lattice
deformation. An ohmic region (3 mV/$\text{\AA}$ $\leq E_0\leq$ 9
mV/$\text{\AA}$) where the stationary velocity increases linearly with the
electric field strength is observed for the case of $U$=2.0 eV and $V$=1.0 eV.
The maximal velocity is well above the speed of sound. Below 3 mV/$\text{\AA}$
the polaron velocity increases nonlinearly and in high electric fields with
strength $E_0\geq$ 10.0 mV/$\text{\AA}$ the polaron will become unstable and
dissociate. The relationship between electron-electron interaction strengths
and polaron transport is also studied in detail. We find that the the on-site
Coulomb interactions $U$ will suppress the polaron transport and small
nearest-neighbor interactions $V$ values are also not beneficial to the
polaronic motion while large $V$ values favor the polaron transport.

effect of oxygen and iron isotopic mass on Tc and the spin-density wave (SDW)
transition temperature (TSDW) in SmFeAsO1-xFx and Ba1-xKxFe2As2 systems. The
results show that oxygen isotope effect on TC and TSDW is very little, while
the iron isotope exponent alpha=-dlnTc/dlnM is about 0.35, being comparable to
0.5 for the full isotope effect. Surprisingly, the iron isotope exchange shows
the same effect on TSDW as TCc These results indicate that electron-phonon
interaction plays some role in the superconducting mechanism, but simple
electron-phonon coupling mechanism seems to be rather unlikely because a strong

of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in perovskite lead zirconate titanate
and related systems has been under intensive studies. Polarization rotation
ideas are frequently invoked to explain the piezoelectric properties. It was
recently reported that lead titanate undergoes a phase transformation sequence
$P4mm\to Pm\to Cm\to R\bar{3}c$ at 10 K as a function of hydrostatic pressure
[M. Ahart et al. Nature Letters. \textbf{451}, 545 (2008)]. We demonstrate that
this interpretation is not correct by (i) simulating the reported diffraction
patterns, and (ii) by density-functional theory computations which show that
neither the $Pm$, $Cm$ nor $Pmm2$ phase is stable in the studied pressure
range, and further show that octahedral tilting is the key stabilization
mechanism under high pressure. Notes on a more general ground are given to
demonstrate that a continuous phase transition between rhombohedral and
tetragonal phases via intermediate monoclinic phase is not possible. Thus,
two-phase co-existence in the vicinity of the phase transition region is
probable and has an important role for electromechanical properties.

collisionless steady-state dust clouds around a Sun-like star. Our models
include enough particles to overcome the limitations of previous simulations
that were often dominated by a handful of long-lived particles, allowing us to
quantitatively study the contrast of the resulting ring structures. We found
that in the case of a planet on a circular orbit, for a given star and dust
source distribution, the morphology and contrast of the resonant structures
depend on only two parameters: planet mass and $\sqrt{a_{\rm p}}/\beta$, where
$a_{\rm p}$ is the planet's semi-major axis and $\beta$ is the ratio of
radiation pressure force to gravitational force on a grain. We constructed
multiple-grain-size models of 25,000 particles each and showed that in a
collisionless cloud, a Dohnanyi crushing law yields a resonant ring whose
optical depth is dominated by the largest grains in the distribution, not the
smallest. We used these models to estimate the mass of the lowest-mass planet
that can be detected through observations of a resonant ring for a variety of
assumptions about the dust cloud and the planet's orbit. Our simulations
suggest that planets with mass as small as a few times Mar's mass may produce
detectable signatures in debris disks for semi-major axes greater than 10 AU.

least-processed materials from the early accretional phase of the solar system.
They allow us to study interrelations between various classes of small bodies,
their origin and evolution.
  Using FORS1 of the ESO VLT, we have obtained linear-polarization measurements
in the Bessell R filter for five TNOs at different values of their phase angle
(i.e., the angle between the Sun, the object, and the Earth). Due to the large
distance of the targets (> 30 AU), the observed range of phase angles is
limited to about 0-2 deg. We have analyzed our new observations of five TNOs,
and those of another four TNOs obtained in previous works, and discovered that
there exist two classes of objects that exhibit different polarimetric
behaviour. Objects with a diameter > 1000 km, such as, e.g., Pluto and Eris,
show a small polarization in the scattering plane (~0.5%) which slowly changes
in the observed phase angle range. In smaller objects such as, e.g., Ixion and
Varuna, linear polarization changes rapidly with the phase angle, and reaches ~
1% (in the scattering plane) at phase angle 1 deg. The larger objects have a
higher albedo than the smaller ones, and have the capability of retaining
volatiles such as CO, N2 and CH4. Both of these facts can be linked to their
different polarimetric behaviour compared to smaller objects.
  In spite of the very limited range of observable phase angles, ground-based
polarimetric observations are a powerful tool to identify different properties
of the surfaces of TNOs. We suggest that a single polarimetric observation at
phase angle ~1 deg allows one to determine whether the target albedo is low or
high.

Contrary to the standard wormhole approach, where first a convenient geometry
is fixed and then the matter distribution is derived, we follow the
conventional approach for finding solutions in theoretical cosmology. We derive
an analytical evolving wormhole geometry by supposing that the radial tension
(which is negative to the radial pressure) and the pressure measured in the
tangential directions have barotropic equations of state with constant state
parameters. At spatial infinity this evolving wormhole, supported by this
anisotropic matter, is asymptotically flat, and its slices $t=$ constant are

expands with constant velocity, i.e without acceleration or deceleration, since

tenths of a parsec of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic centre is
challenging for theories of star formation. The high tidal shear from the black
hole should tear apart the molecular clouds that form stars elsewhere in the
Galaxy, while transporting the stars to the Galactic centre also appears
unlikely during their stellar lifetimes. We present numerical simulations of
the infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The
transfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become
bound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disc that quickly fragments to
form stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises the temperature
of the gas to 100-1000K, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively
high stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disc and, for a
sufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution
of stellar masses. This potentially repetitive process can therefore explain
the presence of multiple eccentric rings of young stars in the presence of a
supermassive black hole.

galaxies, and the starting point for star formation. As such, their properties
play a key role in setting the initial conditions for the formation of stars.
We present a comprehensive combined inteferometric/single-dish study of the
resolved GMC properties in a number of extragalactic systems, including both
normal and dwarf galaxies. We find that the extragalactic GMC properties
measured across a wide range of environments, characterized by the Larson
relations, are to first order remarkably compatible with those in the Milky
Way. Using these data to investigate trends due to galaxy metallicity, we find
that: 1) these measurements do not accord with simple expectations from
photoionization-regulated star formation theory, 2) there is no trend in the
virial CO-to-H2 conversion factor on the spatial scales studied, and 3) there
are measurable departures from the Galactic Larson relations in the Small
Magellanic Cloud -- the object with the lowest metallicity in the sample --
where GMCs have velocity dispersions that are too small for their sizes. I will
discuss the stability of these clouds in the light of our recent far-infrared
analysis of this galaxy, and I will contrast the results of the virial and
far-infrared studies on the issue of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor and what
they tell us about the structure of molecular clouds in primitive galaxies.
