understanding how they form. Brown dwarfs with masses between that of stars and
planets are not massive enough to maintain stable hydrogen-burning fusion
reactions during most of their lifetime. Their origins are subject to much
debate in recent literature because their masses are far below the typical mass
where core collapse is expected to occur. We present the first confirmed
evidence that brown dwarfs undergo a phase of molecular outflow that is typical
of young stars. Using the Submillimeter Array, we have obtained a map of a
bipolar molecular outflow from a young brown dwarf. We estimate an outflow mass
of 1.6 x 10^-4 M_Sun and a mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^-9 M_Sun. These values
are over two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri
stars. From our millimiter continuum data and our own analysis of Spitzer
infrared photometry, we estimate that the brown dwarf has a disk with a mass of
8 x 10^-3 M_Sun and an outer disk radius of 80 AU. Our results demonstrate that
the bipolar molecular outflow operates down to planetary masses, occurring in
brown dwarfs as a scaled-down version of the universal process seen in young
stars.

of the scalar potential with one-dimensional N=2 supersymmetry and how it can
be described in terms of a superpotential. This superpotential can also be

second derivative of the total Kohn-Sham energy of a single reference state, in
contrast to approximations based on Kohn-Sham total energy differences. The
advantage of our approach is twofold: It provides a physically motivated
picture of the transition from a low-spin to a high-spin state, and it utilizes
a perturbation scheme for the evaluation of magnetic exchange couplings. The
latter simplifies the way these parameters are predicted using
first-principles: It avoids the non-trivial search for different spin-states
that needs to be carried out in energy difference methods and it opens the
possibility of ""black-boxifying"" the extraction of exchange couplings from
density functional theory calculations. We present proof of concept

seismics has been considered from a rigorously mathematical viewpoint. An
inclined subsurface reflector with a constant dipping angle has been shown to
cause a shift in the normal moveout equation, with the peak of the moveout
curve tracing an elliptic locus. Since any subsurface reflector actually has a
non-uniform spatial variation, the use of a more comprehensive principle of
migration, by adopting the wave equation, has been argued to be necessary. By
this approach an expression has been derived for both the amplitude and the
phase of a subsurface wavefield with vertical velocity variation. This
treatment has entailed the application of the WKB approximation, whose
self-consistency has been established by the fact that the logarithmic
variation of the velocity is very slow in the vertical direction, a feature
that is much more strongly upheld at increasingly greater subsurface depths.
Finally, it has been demonstrated that for a planar subsurface wavefield, there
is an equivalence between the constant velocity Stolt Migration algorithm and
the stationary phase approximation method (by which the origin of the reflected
subsurface signals is determined).

whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range irrespective of the values of channel
variances. Based on those lower bounds, finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing
tradeoffs of the ANC and TDBC protocols are obtained. Secondly, we investigate
how to efficiently use channel state information (CSI) in those two protocols.
Specifically, an optimum power allocation scheme is proposed for the ANC
protocol. It simultaneously minimizes the outage probability and maximizes the
total mutual information of this protocol. For the TDBC protocol, an optimum
method to combine the received signals at the relay terminal is developed under
an equal power allocation assumption. This method minimizes the outage
probability and maximizes the total mutual information of the TDBC protocol at

the DR5 QSO catalog, and also for spectra from additional SDSS observing epochs
when available. In cases where BAL QSOs have been observed with Chandra or
XMM-Newton, we report the X-ray monochromatic luminosities of these sources.
  We confirm and extend previous findings that BAL QSOs are more strongly
reddened in the rest-frame UV than non-BAL QSOs and that BAL QSOs are
relatively X-ray weak compared to non-BAL QSOs. The observed BAL fraction is
dependent on the spectral signal-to-noise (S/N); for higher-S/N sources, we
find an observed BAL fraction of approximately 15%. BAL QSOs show a similar
Baldwin effect as for non-BAL QSOs, in that their CIV emission equivalent
widths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. However, BAL QSOs have
weaker CIV emission in general than do non-BAL QSOs. Sources with higher UV
luminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the BAL
outflow velocity and UV absorption strength are correlated with relative X-ray
weakness. These results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend on
strong X-ray absorption to shield the outflow from over-ionization and enable
radiative acceleration....

data and the solar irradiance have revealed a highly significant, high-Q common
modulation at 11.85 yr-1. Since the stability of this frequency points to an
explanation in terms of rotation, this result may be attributable to
non-spherically-symmetric nuclear burning in a solar core with sidereal
rotation frequency 12.85 yr-1. The variability of the amplitude (on a timescale
of years) suggests that the relevant nuclear burning is variable as well as
asymmetric. Recent analysis of Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino data has
revealed r-mode-type modulations with frequencies corresponding to a region
with sidereal rotation frequency 13.97 yr-1. If this modulation is attributed
to the RSFP (Resonant Spin Flavor Precession) process, it provides a
measurement of the rotation rate deep in the radiative zone. These two results
suggest that the core rotates significantly more slowly than the radiative
zone. If one accepts an upper limit of 7 MG for the Sun's internal magnetic
field, an RSFP interpretation of the Super-Kamiokande results leads to a lower
limit of 10-12 Bohr magnetons for the neutrino transition magnetic moment.

moment (EDM) experiments, focusing on gadolinium iron garnet (abbreviated GdIG,

maintains its high magnetic susceptibility down to 4.2 K, which enhances the
EDM-induced magnetization of a sample placed in an electric field. We estimate
that lattice polarizability gives rise to an EDM enhancement factor of
approximately 20. We also calculate the effect of the demagnetizing field for
various sample geometries and permeabilities. Measurements of intrinsic GdIG
magnetization noise are presented, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is
used to compare our data with the measurements of the imaginary part of GdIG
permeability at 4.2 K, showing good agreement above frequencies of a few hertz.
We also observe how the demagnetizing field suppresses the noise-induced
magnetic flux, confirming our calculations. The statistical sensitivity of an
EDM search based on a solid GdIG sample is estimated to be on the same level as
the present experimental limit. Such a measurement would be valuable, given the
completely different methods and systematics involved. The most significant
systematics in such an experiment are the magnetic hysteresis and the
magneto-electric effect. Our analysis shows that it should be possible to
control these at the level of statistical sensitivity.

and Tweedie). If the Lyapunov function is strong enough, one has a spectral gap
in a weighted supremum norm (cf. Meyn and Tweedie).
  Traditional proofs of this result rely on the decomposition of the Markov
chain into excursions away from the small set and a careful analysis of the
exponential tail of the length of these excursions. There have been other
variations which have made use of Poisson equations or worked at getting
explicit constants. The present proof is very direct, and relies instead on
introducing a family of equivalent weighted norms indexed by a parameter
$\beta$ and to make an appropriate choice of this parameter that allows to
combine in a very elementary way the two ingredients (existence of a Lyapunov
function and irreducibility) that are crucial in obtaining a spectral gap.
  The original motivation of this proof was the authors' work on spectral gaps
in Wasserstein metrics. The proof presented in this note is a version of our
reasoning in the total variation setting which we used to guide the
calculations in arXiv:math/0602479. While we initially produced it for that
purpose, we hope that it will be of interest in its own right.

merger point, where the ergosurfaces bounding each ergoregion just touch,
solutions exhibit universal behavior when there is rotation only in one plane:
the angle between the merging ergosurfaces depends only on the symmetries of
the solution, not on any other details of the configuration. We show that
universality follows from the fact that the relevant component of Einstein's
equation reduces to Laplace equation at the point of merger. Thus ergoregion
mergers mimic mergers of Newtonian equipotentials and have similar universal
behavior. For solutions with rotation in more than one plane, universality is
lost. We demonstrate universality and non-universality in several explicit

configuration, the impacts transform the disks into structures that are roughly
three times as thick and more than twice as kinematically hot as the observed
dominant thin disk component of the Milky Way. We conclude that if the Galactic
thin disk is a representative case, then the presence of a stabilizing gas

galaxies in an LCDM universe; otherwise, the disk of the Milky Way must be
uncommonly cold and thin for its luminosity, perhaps as a consequence of an

redshifts and ~31000 LBGs in 31 spatially-independent fields over a total area
of 3261 arcmin^2. These data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07L* and 0.10L*
at z~2 and z~3, respectively. A maximum likelihood analysis indicates steep
values of alpha(z=2)=-1.73+/-0.07 and alpha(z=3)=-1.73+/-0.13. This result is
robust to luminosity dependent systematics in the Ly-alpha equivalent width and
reddening distributions, is similar to the steep values advocated at z>4, and
implies that ~93% of the unobscured UV luminosity density at z~2-3 arises from
sub-L* galaxies. With a realistic luminosity dependent reddening distribution,
faint to moderately luminous galaxies account for >70% and >25% of the
bolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density,
respectively, when integrated over 1.9<z<3.4. We find a factor of 8-9 increase
in the star formation rate density between z~6 and z~2, due to both a
brightening of L* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lower
redshifts. The previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the star
formation history and stellar mass density measurements at z~2 may be
reconciled by invoking a luminosity dependent reddening correction to the star
formation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed
by UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant alpha of the UV LF at
z>2 contrasts with the shallower value inferred locally, suggesting that the
evolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability of
low mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z<2. [Abridged]

de Bure interferometer in CO(J=2-1) and SiO(J=2-1) achieving angular
resolutions between 2'' and 4''. To improve the quality of the CO(2-1) images,
we have added single dish data to the interferometer visibilities.
  Results: The outflow consists of two distinct components. At velocities <10
km/s, the gas forms two opposed, approximately conical shells that have the YSO
at their vertex. These shells coincide with the walls of evacuated cavities and
seem to result from the acceleration of the ambient gas by a wide-angle wind.
At velocities >30 km/s, the gas forms two opposed jets that travel along the
center of the cavities and whose emission is dominated by a symmetric
collection of at least 7 pairs of peaks. The velocity field of this component
presents a sawtooth pattern with the gas in the tail of each peak moving faster
than the gas in the head. This pattern, together with a systematic widening of
the peaks with distance to the central source, is consistent with the emission
arising from internal working surfaces traveling along the jet and resulting
from variations in the velocity field of ejection. We interpret this component
as the true protostellar wind, and we find its composition consistent with a
chemical model of such type of wind.
  Conclusions: Our results support outflow wind models that have simultaneously
wide-angle and narrow components, and suggest that the EHV peaks seen in a
number of outflows consist of internally-shocked wind material.

h-1 Msun (C1) and a rich cluster with M200~2x10^15 h-1 Msun (C2) at z = 0. The
simulated proto-clusters show evidence of ongoing assembly of a dominating
central galaxy. The stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the
C2 system is in excess with respect to observational estimates for the
Spiderweb galaxy, with a total star formation rate which is also larger than
indicated by observations. We find that the projected velocities of galaxies in
the C2 cluster are consistent with observations, while those measured for the
poorer cluster C1 are too low compared to the observed velocities. We argue
that the Spiderweb complex resemble the high-redshift progenitor of a rich
galaxy cluster. Our results indicate that the included supernovae feedback is
not enough to suppress star formation in these systems, supporting the need of
introducing AGN feedback. According to our simulations, a diffuse atmosphere of
hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium should already be present at this redshift,

the properties of ""central"" and ""satellite"" galaxies separately. For central
galaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching is
primarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these two
quantities are themselves strongly correlated. For satellite galaxies, a nearly
equally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. We make the
same comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on three
independently developed codes. We find that the models with AGN feedback
reproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red and
passive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. However, for satellite
galaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passive
galaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halo
mass. This {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapid
stripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulation
of star formation.

observations in the F160W filter of a sample of 32 early-type galaxies (ETGs)

We find that ETGs at are composed of two distinct populations, an older
population (oETGs) and a younger population (yETGs) whose mean ages differ by
about 1.5-2 Gyr. Young ETGs are not denser than local ones since they follow
the size-mass relation of local ETGs and luminosity evolution brings them onto
the local Kormendy and size-luminosity relations. On the constrary, old ETGs do
not follow the size-mass relation of local ETGs and luminosity evolution does
not account for the discrepancy they show with respect to the local
size-luminosity and Kormendy relations. An increase of their effective radius
R_e by a factor 2.5-3 (a density decrease by a factor 15-30) from z~1.5-2 to
z~0 is required to bring these galaxies onto the local scaling relations. The
different behaviour shown by the two populations implies different formation
and evolution scenarios. The older population must have formed at higher-z in a
sort of dissipative gas-rich collapse ables to produce remnants which at z~2
are old and compact. The size evolution they must experience from z~2 to z~0
has to leave unchanged their mass to not exceed the local number of high-mass
ETGs. Thus, major merging cannot fit this requirement. The younger population
of ETGs can be formed later through subsequent episodes of merging which
increased progressively their size and assembled their mass down to z~2. At z<2

of gas in pre-galactic DM haloes with T_vir ~ 10000 K show that the gas loses
90% and more of its angular momentum before rotational support sets in. In a
fraction of these haloes where the metallicity is low and UV radiation
suppresses H_2 cooling, conditions are thus very favourable for the rapid
build-up of massive black holes. Depending on the progression of metal
enrichment, the continued suppression of H_2 cooling by external and internal
UV radiation and the ability to trap the entropy produced by the release of
gravitational energy, the gas at the centre of the halo is expected to form a
supermassive star, a stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-Eddington
accretion rates or a compact star-cluster undergoing collisional run-away of
massive stars at its centre. In all three cases a massive black hole of
initially modest mass finds itself at the center of a rapid inflow of gas with
inflow rates of ~ 1 M_solar\yr. The massive black hole will thus grow quickly
to a mass of 10^5 to 10^6 M_solar until further inflow is halted either by
consumption of gas by star formation or by the increasing energy and momentum
feedback from the growing massive black hole. Conditions for the formation of
massive seed black holes in this way are most favourable in haloes with T_vir ~
15000 K and V_vir ~ 20 km\s with less massive haloes not allowing collapse of
gas by atomic cooling and more massive haloes being more prone to
fragmentation. This should imprint a characteristic mass on the mass spectrum
of an early population of massive black hole seeds in pre-galactic haloes which
will later grow into the observed population of supermassive black holes in
galactic bulges.

combine the high pairing energy of underdoped layers with the large carrier

Interestingly, the question hinges on the fundamental nature of the
superconducting state in the underdoped regime. Within a plain slave boson mean
field theory, there is absolutely no enhancement of Tc. However, we do get a
substantial enhancement for moderate inter-layer tunneling when we use an
effective low energy theory of the bilayer in which the effective quasiparticle
charge in the underdoped regime is taken as an independent phenomenological
parameter. We study the Tc enhancement as a function of the doping level and
the inter-layer tunneling, and discuss possible connections to recent
experiments by Yuli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 057005 (2008)]. Finally, we
predict a unique paramagnetic reduction of the zero temperature phase stiffness
of coupled layers, which depends on the difference in the current carried by
quasiparticles on the two types of layers as (J1-J2)^2.

Weissenberg numbers $We$, we show that the linearized dynamics can be
decomposed into slow and fast subsystems, and establish analytically that the
steady-state variances of velocity and polymer stress fluctuations scale as $O
(We^2)$ and $O (We^4)$, respectively. This demonstrates that large velocity
variance can be sustained even in weakly inertial stochastically driven channel
flows of viscoelastic fluids. We further show that the wall-normal and spanwise
forces have the strongest impact on the flow fluctuations, and that the
influence of these forces is largest on the fluctuations in streamwise velocity
and the streamwise component of the polymer stress tensor. The underlying
physical mechanism involves polymer stretching that introduces a lift-up of
flow fluctuations similar to vortex tilting in inertia-dominated flows. The
validity of our analytical results is confirmed in stochastic simulations. The
phenomenon examined here provides a possible route for the early stages of a
bypass transition to elastic turbulence and might be exploited to enhance

orthorhombic (LTO) \textit{Pbca} phase. This behavior is similar to that in
La$_2$CuO$_4$, but a new inelastic feature that is not found in the cuprate is
present. An anomalous phonon mode is observed at energy transfers greater than
the $\Sigma_{4}$ albeit with similar dispersion. This anomalous phonon mode
never softens below $\sim 5$ meV, even for temperatures below the HTT-LTO

scale-free phenomenon and small-world effect, both of which play a significant
role in the dynamical processes running on networks. Although various dynamical
processes have been investigated in scale-free small-world networks, analytical
research about random walks on such networks is much less. In this paper, we
will study analytically the scaling of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for
random walks on scale-free small-world networks. To this end, we first map the
classical Koch fractal to a network, called Koch network. According to this
proposed mapping, we present an iterative algorithm for generating the Koch
network, based on which we derive closed-form expressions for the relevant
topological features, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient,
average path length, and degree correlations. The obtained solutions show that
the Koch network exhibits scale-free behavior and small-world effect. Then, we
investigate the standard random walks and trapping issue on the Koch network.
Through the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the Koch
network, we obtain the exact scaling for the MFPT. We show that in the infinite
network order limit, the MFPT grows linearly with the number of all nodes in
the network. The obtained analytical results are corroborated by direct
extensive numerical calculations. In addition, we also determine the scaling
efficiency exponents characterizing random walks on the Koch network.

response, essentially no phase shift is induced on two-single-photon input
states, and thus a quantum gate build from such a medium cannot work. Here we
show that a fast response Kerr medium induces some but very little phase shifts
on a two-single-photon input state, and it is insufficient for high fidelity
quantum computation. We point out that this is caused by the medium imparting
spectral entanglement to the input photons. We further show that a way to
circumvent this problem and achieve a high fidelity gate, is to engineer the
dispersion properties of the medium to give a dominant spectral effect over the
non-instantaneous response, in addition to satisfying a phase matching

``adiabatic'' solutions in which, far outside the horizon, in a suitable gauge,
the reduced spatial metric $g_{ij}({\bf x},t)/a^2(t)$ becomes a
time-independent function ${\cal G}_{ij}({\bf x})$, and all perturbations to
the other metric components and to all matter variables vanish. The corrections
are of order $a^{-2}$, and their ${\bf x}$-dependence is now explicitly given
in terms of ${\cal G}_{ij}({\bf x})$ and its derivatives. The previous results
for the time-dependence of the corrections to $g_{ij}({\bf x},t)/a^2(t)$ in the
case of multi-scalar field theories are now shown to apply for any theory whose
anisotropic inertia vanishes to order $a^{-2}$. Further, it is shown that the

Switching (OBS) networks. Deflection routing is used to resolve contention.
Burst retransmission is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) by
retransmitting dropped bursts. Previous works show that combining deflection
and retransmission outperforms both pure deflection and pure retransmission
approaches. This paper proposes a new Adaptive Hybrid Deflection and
Retransmission (AHDR) approach that dynamically combines deflection and

be weakly linearly polarized, e.g., in the presence of a magnetic field.
Compared to polarized dust emission, the GK effect has the potential to yield
additional information along the line of sight through its dependence on
velocity in the line profile. Our goal was to detect polarized molecular line
emission toward the DR21(OH), W3OH/H2O, G34.3+0.2, and UYSO1 dense molecular
cloud cores in transitions of rare CO isotopologues and CS. The feasibility of
such observations had to be established by studying the influence of polarized
sidelobes, e.g., in the presence of extended emission in the surroundings of
compact sources. The observations were carried out with the IRAM 30m telescope
employing the correlation polarimeter XPOL and using two orthogonally polarized
receivers. We produced beam maps to investigate instrumental polarization.
While in nearly all transitions toward all sources a polarized signal is found,
its degree of polarization only in one case surpasses the polarization that can
be expected due to instrumental effects. It is shown that any emission in the
polarized sidelobes of the system can produce instrumental polarization, even
if the source is unpolarized. Tentative evidence for astronomically polarized
line emission with pL<~1.5% was found in the CS(2-1) line toward G34.3+0.2.

to several years. The currently favoured explanation for this brightness boost
is that of dramatically rising accretion from the disc material around a young
star. The mechanism leading to this accretion increase is a point of debate.
Aims: Choosing the Orion Nebula Cluster as representative we simulate accretion
bursts driven by encounters in dense stellar environments. We investigate
whether properties like rise and decay times, event frequency etc. speak for
encounters as a possible cause for FUor phenomena. Method: We combine cluster
simulations performed with the Nbody6++ code with particle simulations that
describe the effect of a fly-by on the disc around a young star to determine
the induced mass accretion. Results: The induced accretion rates, the overall
temporal accretion profile, decay time and possibly the binarity rate we obtain
for encounter-induced accretion agree very well with observations of FUors.
However, the rise-time of one year observed in some FUors is difficult to
achieve in our simulations unless the matter is stored somewhere close to the
star and then released after a certain mass limit is transgressed. The severest
argument against the FUors phenomenon being caused by encounters is that most
FUors are found in environments of low stellar density. We extend the
discussion to eccentric binaries and gravitationally unstable discs and find
that both models have similar problems in achieving the necessary rise-times.
Conclusions: We predict that in dense young clusters these outbursts should
predominantly happen close to the cluster center and with large mass ratios
between the involved stars.(abridged)

We relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraint
satisfaction problems (SCSPs) to that used in graphical games, showing that for
a large class of SCSPs that includes weighted constraints every optimal
solution corresponds to a Nash equilibrium that is also a Pareto efficient

longer self-similar invariant and the diffusion term in the equation
significantly affects the large-time behavior of solutions; thus the approach
developed earlier based on the self-similar scaling does not directly apply. In
this paper, we develop another approach for establishing the decay of periodic
solutions for anisotropic degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations. The proof
is based on the kinetic formulation of entropy solutions. It involves time
translations and a monotonicity-in-time property of entropy solutions, and
employs the advantages of the precise kinetic equation for the solutions in

  In this paper we introduce a measure for comparing two mechanisms with
respect to the final welfare they generate. This measure induces a partial
order on mechanisms and we study the question of finding minimal elements with
respect to this partial order. In particular, we say a non-deficit Groves
mechanism is welfare undominated if there exists no other non-deficit Groves
mechanism that always has a smaller or equal sum of payments. We focus on two
domains: (i) auctions with multiple identical units and unit-demand bidders,
and (ii) mechanisms for public project problems. In the first domain we
analytically characterize all welfare undominated Groves mechanisms that are
anonymous and have linear payment functions, by showing that the family of
optimal-in-expectation linear redistribution mechanisms, which were introduced
in [6] and include the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism [1,2], coincides with the
family of welfare undominated Groves mechanisms that are anonymous and linear
in the setting we study. In the second domain we show that the classic VCG

rigid conformal invariance by coupling to a background metric and demanding
local Weyl invariance, a method which applies neither to massive theories nor
theories which rely upon gauge invariances for masslessness. We extend this
method to describe massive and gauge invariant theories using Weyl invariance.
The key idea is to introduce a new scalar field which is constant when
evaluated at the scale corresponding to the metric of physical interest. This
technique relies on being able to efficiently construct Weyl invariant
theories. This is achieved using tractor calculus--a mathematical machinery
designed for the study of conformal geometry. From a physics standpoint, this
amounts to arranging fields in multiplets with respect to the conformal group
but with novel Weyl transformation laws. Our approach gives a mechanism for
generating masses from Weyl weights. Breitenlohner--Freedman stability bounds
for Anti de Sitter theories arise naturally as do direct derivations of the
novel Weyl invariant theories given by Deser and Nepomechie. In constant
curvature spaces, partially massless theories--which rely on the interplay
between mass and gauge invariance--are also generated by our method. Another
simple consequence is conformal invariance of the maximal depth partially
massless theories. Detailed examples for spins s<=2 are given including tractor
and component actions, on-shell and off-shell approaches and gauge invariances.
For all spins s>=2 we give tractor equations of motion unifying massive,
massless, and partially massless theories.

mass deformation preserving maximal supersymmetry can be used to study N=4
super Yang-Mills theory on RxS^3 in the planar limit. When the mass parameter
is large, we can integrate out all the massive fluctuations around a particular
classical solution, which corresponds to RxS^3. The resulting effective theory
for the gauge field moduli at finite temperature is studied both analytically
and numerically, and shown to reproduce the deconfinement phase transition in
N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on RxS^3 at weak coupling. This transition was
speculated to be a continuation of the conjectured phase transition at strong
coupling, which corresponds to the Hawking-Page transition based on the
gauge-gravity duality. By choosing a different classical solution of the same
model, one can also reproduce results for gauge theories on other space-time
such as RxS^3/Z_q and RxS^2. All these theories can be studied at strong
coupling by the new simulation method, which was used successfully for
supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics without mass deformation.

  As a result we find that equations for non-equilibrium thermodynamics are

This includes a microcanonical entropy definition dependent on the

and it is the first clear detection of the 2175A bump in a GRB host galaxy,
while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have been
recorded in the past decade. The derived extinction curve gives A_V=0.8-1.5
depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. Of the three local extinction laws,
an LMC type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the host
of GRB070802. Besides the 2175A bump we find that the spectrum of GRB070802 is
characterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly a
high metallicity for a GRB sightline ([Si/H]=-0.46+/-0.38,
[Zn/H]=-0.50+/-0.68). In particular, the spectrum of GRB070802 is unique for a
GRB spectrum in that it shows clear CI absorption features, leading us to
propose a correlation between the presence of the bump and CI. The gas to dust
ratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of other
GRB hosts with N(HI)/A_V=(2.4+/-1.0)x10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1, which lies between
typical MW and LMC values. Our results are in agreement with the tentative
conclusion reached by Gordon et al. 2003 that the shape of the extinction
curve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the UV flux
density in the environment of the dust.

GeV$^2, due to the two-pion threshold, and required by t-channel unitarity, is
expected, and b) possible small-period oscillations between $t=0$ and the dip
region. 2) In measuring the elastic $pp$ scattering and total $pp$ cross
section at the LHC, the experimentalists are urged to treat the total cross
section $\sigma_t,$ the ratio $\rho$, the forward slope $B$ and the luminosity
${\cal L}$ as free arameters, and to publish model-independent results on
${dN/{dt}}.$ 3) Of extreme interest are the details of the expected diffraction
minimum in the differential cross section. Its position, expected in the
interval $0.4<-t<1$ GeV$^2$ at the level of about $10^{-2} {\rm mb} \cdot$
GeV$^{-2}\div 10^{-1} {\rm mb}\cdot$ GeV$^{-2}$, cannot be predicted
unambiguously, and its depth, i.e. the ratio of $d\sigma/dt$ at the minimum to
that at the subsequent maximum (about $-t=5 $GeV$^2$, which is about 5 is of
great importance. 4) The expected slow-down with increasing $|t|$ of the
shrinkage of the second cone (beyond the dip-bump), together with the
transition from an exponential to a power decrease in $-t$, will be indicative
of the transition from ""soft"" to ""hard"" physics. Explicit models are proposed
to help in quantifying this transition. 5) In a number of papers a limiting

calculations using the semiclassical, impact parameter method are improved by a
new method suitable to calculate impact parameter values corresponding to
different momentum transfers. This goal is achieved by two successive steps.
First, using the transverse momentum balance different projectile scattering
angles are calculated for the binary and recoil peak regions as a function of
the transferred momentum. Then, by treating the projectile scattering as a
classical potential scattering problem, impact parameters are assigned to these
scattering angles. The new method, which no longer contains empirical
considerations, is tested calculating by fully differential ionization cross
sections for single ionization of helium produced by fast C$^{6+}$ ions.

asymptotically like a Gaussian random variable as the number of receive and
transmit antennas converge to +$\infty$ at the same rate. However, this
approximation being inaccurate for the estimation of some performance metrics
such as the Bit Error Rate and the outage probability, especially for small

follows a generalized Gamma distribution which parameters are tuned by
computing the first three asymptotic moments of the SNR. In this article, this
technique is generalized to (receive) correlated channels, and closed-form

internal shocks driven by small timescale, ~1 ms, variation in the GRB
outflows, and a pair-production spectral cutoff is generally expected around
the GeV range. However, the observed optical flashes accompanying GRBs suggest
that the delayed residual collisions due to large timescale variation continue
to accelerate electrons. We show here that the inverse-Compton (IC) scattering
of the prompt gamma-rays by these residual internal shock electrons leads to a
high energy emission beyond the previously thought spectral cutoff, in
agreement with the previous detections of GeV photons by EGRET in several GRBs
in conjunction with MeV emission. We expect a spectral break due to the
transition from the primary to residual internal shock emission at the
previously thought spectral cutoff, and expect systematic time delays of high
energy photons relative to MeV emission, the discovery of which would provide
stringent constraint on the outflow properties, but requires large enough
collection of high energy photons by, e.g., Fermi and AGILE satellites.
  The recent Fermi-detected bright GRB 080916c unambiguously shows the shifting
of the prompt emission toward later times as the photon energy increases, as
predicted in the residual collision model. The detected prompt, highest energy
photon (about 70 GeV in the rest frame of the GRB) may not be produced by
primary internal shocks but by IC emission in residual collisions. With the
method involving time delays of high energy emission, the bulk Lorentz factor
of GRB 080916c is determined to be \Gamma ~ 300.

this approach, we have estimated the influence of the surface oxide layer on
the band structure of macroporous silicon. We observed the shift of the gaps'
edges to the higher or lower frequencies, depending on the interlayer thickness
and dielectric constant. We have shown that the existence of a native oxide
surface layer should be taken into consideration to understand the optical
properties of 2D photonic crystals, particularly in macroporous silicon
structures.

a pair of detectors for a differential neutrino flux measurement, providing
sensitivity to sin^2(2theta13) > 0.03. Reaching this goal requires significant
improvements in systematic uncertainties, based on the experience with previous
reactor neutrino experiments.

pair creation from the vacuum at the horizon. In the fuzzball proposal,
individual microstates do not have a horizon with the `vacuum' state in its
vicinity. For a special family of non-extremal microstates it was recently
found that emission occurs due to pair creation in an ergoregion, rather than
at a horizon. In this paper we extend this result to a slightly larger class of
microstates, again finding exact agreement between the emission in the gravity
picture and the CFT dual. We write down an expression for emission from
geometries with ergoregions, in terms of the leading falloff behavior of the
wavefunctions in the fuzzball region. Finally, we describe another family of
nonextremal microstates and find their ergoregion.
