V1 which has been shown to emerge from the reduction of higher-order
correlations in natural images in a large variety of statistical image models.
The most parsimonious one among these models is linear Independent Component
Analysis (ICA), whereas second-order decorrelation transformations such as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) do not yield oriented filters. Because of
this finding it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation
selectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. In order to
assess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question
how much more redundancies can be removed with ICA in comparison to PCA, or
other second-order decorrelation methods. This question has not yet been
settled, as over the last ten years contradicting results have been reported
ranging from less than five to more than hundred percent extra gain for ICA.
Here, we aim at resolving this conflict by presenting a very careful and
comprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy
reduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss we
compute, for the first time, complete rate-distortion curves for ICA in
comparison with PCA. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the ICA
filters is surprisingly small. Furthermore, we show that a simple spherically
symmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data even better
than the probabilistic model underlying ICA. Since spherically symmetric models
are agnostic with respect to the specific filter shapes, we conlude that
orientation selectivity is unlikely to play a critical role for redundancy
reduction.

investigate both horizontal gene transfer from a population and recombination
between pairs of individuals. Somewhat surprisingly, these nonlinear
generalizations of quasi-species theory to modern biology are analytically
solvable. For two-parent recombination, we find two selected phases, one of
which is spectrally rigid. We present exact analytical formulas for the
equilibrium mean fitness of the population, in terms of a maximum principle,
which are generally applicable to any permutation invariant replication rate
function. For smooth fitness landscapes, we show that when positive epistatic
interactions are present, recombination or horizontal gene transfer introduces
a mild load against selection. Conversely, if the fitness landscape exhibits
negative epistasis, horizontal gene transfer or recombination introduce an
advantage by enhancing selection towards the fittest genotypes. These results
prove that the mutational deterministic hypothesis holds for quasi-species
models. For the discontinuous single sharp peak fitness landscape, we show that
horizontal gene transfer has no effect on the fitness, while recombination
decreases the fitness, for both the parallel and the Eigen models. We present
numerical and analytical results as well as phase diagrams for the different

observational signatures of magnetization of the GRB ejecta on the onset of the

simulations of the interaction of a radially expanding, magnetized ejecta with
the interstellar medium. The need of ultrahigh numerical resolution derives
from the extreme jump conditions in the region of interaction between the
ejecta and the circumburst medium. We study the evolution of an
ultrarelativistic shell all the way to a the self-similar asymptotic phase. Our
simulations show that the complete evolution can be characterized in terms of
two parameters, namely, the \xi parameter introduced by Sari & Piran (1995) and
the magnetization \sigma_0. We exploit this property by producing numerical
models where the shell Lorentz factor is \gamma_0 ~ tens and rescaling the
results to arbitrarily large \gamma_0. We find that the reverse shock is
typically very weak or absent for ejecta characterized by \sigma_0 >~ 1. The
onset of the forward shock emission is strongly affected by the magnetization.
On the other hand, the magnetic energy of the shell is transfered to the
external medium on a short timescale (~several times the duration of the
burst). The later forward shock emission does not contain information for the
initial magnetization of the flow. The asymptotic evolution of strongly
magnetized shells, after they have suffred a substantial deceleration,
resembles that of hydrodynamic shells, i.e., they fully enter in the

non-interacting wire we find that a tip in the voltage-probe configuration
affects the source-drain transport in different ways, namely by suppressing the
conductance, by modulating the Fabry-Perot oscillations, and by reducing their
visibility. The combined effect of electron electron interaction and finite
length of the wire, accounted for by the inhomogeneous Luttinger liquid model,
leads to significantly modified predictions as compared to models based on
infinite wires. We show that when the tip injects electrons asymmetrically the
charge fractionalization induced by interaction cannot be inferred from the
asymmetry of the currents flowing in source and drain. Nevertheless interaction
effects are visible as oscillations in the non-linear tip-source and tip-drain

surfaces due to the mixing processes. Consequently, these stars may have winds
driven purely by CNO elements. We study the properties of such stellar winds
and discuss their influence on the surrounding environment. For this purpose,
we used our own NLTE models and tested which stellar parameters of the first
stars at different evolutionary stages result in CNO winds. If such winds are
possible, we calculate their hydrodynamic structure and predict their
parameters. We show that, while the studied stars do not have any wind driven
purely by hydrogen and helium, CNO driven winds exist in more luminous stars.
On the other hand, for very hot stars, CNO elements are too ionized to drive a
wind. In most cases the derived mass-loss rate is much less than calculated
with solar mixture of elements. This is because wind mass-loss rate in present
hot stars is dominated by elements heavier than CNO. We conclude that, until a
sufficient amount of these elements is created, the influence of line-driven
winds is relatively small on the evolution of hot stars (which are not close to
the Eddington limit).

proven to be a very useful technique for the structural fingerprinting of small

measured vibrational spectra of small cationic cobalt clusters show a strong
dependence on the number of adsorbed Ar probe atoms, which increases with
decreasing cluster size. Focusing on the series Co_4^+ to Co_8^+ we therefore
use density-functional theory to analyze the nature of the Ar-Co_n^+ bond and
its role for the vibrational spectra. In a first step, energetically low-lying
isomer structures are identified through first-principles basin-hopping
sampling runs and their vibrational spectra computed for a varying number of
adsorbed Ar atoms. A comparison of these fingerprints with the experimental
data enables in some cases a unique assignment of the cluster structure.
Independent of the specific low-lying isomer, we obtain a pronounced increase
of the Ar binding energy for the smallest cluster sizes, which correlates
nicely with the observed increased influence of the Ar probe atoms on the IR
spectra. Further analysis of the electronic structure motivates a simple
electrostatic picture that not only explains this binding energy trend, but
also why the influence of the rare-gas atom is much stronger than in the
previously studied systems.

effects caused by O atom adsorption on Rh(111) and Ru(0001) were found to be
additive: the measured shifts for first layer Ru atoms depended linearly on the
number of directly coordinated O atoms. Density-functional theory calculations
quantitatively reproduced this effect, allowed separation of initial and final
state contributions, and provided an explanation in terms of a roughly constant
charge transfer per O atom. We have now conducted similar measurements and
calculations for three well-defined adsorbate and coadsorbate layers containing
O and H atoms: (1 x 1)-H, (2 x 2)-(O+H), and (2 x 2)-(O+3H) on Ru(0001). As H
is stabilized in fcc sites in the prior two structures and in hcp sites in the
latter, this enables us to not only study coverage and coadsorption effects on
the adsorbate-induced SCLSs, but also the sensitivity to similar adsorption
sites. Remarkably good agreement is obtained between experiment and
calculations for the energies and geometries of the layers, as well as for all
aspects of the SCLS values. The additivity of the next-neighbor
adsorbate-induced SCLSs is found to prevail even for the coadsorbate
structures. While this confirms the suggested use of SCLSs as fingerprints of
the adsorbate configuration, their sensitivity is further demonstrated by the
slightly different shifts unambiguously determined for H adsorption in either
fcc or hcp hollow sites.

almost uninterrupted observation for two weeks in 2003 Nov/Dec. The data were
analyzed with OSA 7.0 and FTOOLS 6.2. We derive the pulse period, light curves,
spectra, hardness ratios, and hardness intensity diagrams, and study the
eclipse. In addition to an already high activity level, Vela X-1 exhibited
several intense flares, the brightest ones reaching a maximum intensity of more
than 5 Crab in the 20-40 keV band and several off states where the source was
no longer detected by INTEGRAL. We determine the pulse period to be
283.5320+/-0.0002 s, which is stable throughout the entire observation.
Analyzing the eclipses provided an improvement in the ephemeris. Spectral
analysis of the flares indicates that there appear to be two types of flares:
relatively brief flares, which can be extremely intense and show spectral
softening, in contrast to high intensity states, which are longer and show no
softening. Both flares and off states are interpreted as being due to a
strongly structured wind of the optical companion. When Vela X-1 encounters a
cavity with strongly reduced density, the flux will drop triggering the onset
of the propeller effect, which inhibits further accretion, giving rise to off
states. The sudden decrease in the density of the material required to trigger
the propeller effect in Vela X-1 is of the same order as predicted by
theoretical papers about the densities in OB star winds. A similarly structured
wind can produce giant flares when Vela X-1 encounters a dense blob in the
wind.

Kuperberg by showing that, under a cyclic condition, a spectral
characterization of the Markov transition matrix delineates precisely when the

emission from individual intergalactic AGB stars and planetary nebulae in the

rail gun (EMG) due to the confinement of the current in a narrow surface layer
resulting from the skin effect. In order to obtain analytic results, we assume
a simple geometry for the rails, an electromagnetic skin effect boundary edge
that propagates with the accelerating armature, and a current carrying channel
controlled by magnetic field diffusion into the rails. We compute the
temperature distribution in the rails at the time that the armature leaves the
rails. For the range of exit velocities, from 1500 m/s to 5000 m/s, we find the
highest temperatures are near the gun breech. After a single gun firing, the
temperature reaches the melting temperature of the metal rails in a layer of
finite thickness near the surface of the rails, for rails made of copper or
tantalum. We plot the thickness of the melt layer as a function of position
along the rails. In all cases, the thickness of the melt layer increases with
gun velocity, making damage to the gun rails more likely at higher velocity. We
also calculate the efficiency of the EMG as a function of gun velocity and find
that the efficiency increases with increasing velocity, but only if the length
of the gun is sufficiently long. The thickness of the melted layer also
decreases with increasing rail length. Therefore, there is a tradeoff: for
rails of sufficient length, the gun efficiency increases with increasing
velocity but the melted layer thickness in the rails also increases.

a key to understand the origin and maintenance of both starburst and nuclear
(AGN) activity in galaxies. The processes involved in AGN fueling encompass a
wide range of scales, both spatial and temporal, which have to be studied.
Probing the gas flow from the outer disk down to the central engine of an AGN
host, requires the use of specific tracers of the interstellar medium adapted
to follow the change of phase of the gas as a function of radius. Current
mm-interferometers can provide a sharp view of the distribution and kinematics
of molecular gas in the circumnuclear disks of galaxies through extensive CO
line mapping. As such, CO maps are an essential tool to study AGN feeding
mechanisms in the local universe. This is the scientific driver of the NUclei
of GAlaxies (NUGA) survey, whose latest results are here reviewed. On the other
hand, the use of specific molecular tracers of the dense gas phase can probe
the feedback influence of activity on the chemistry and energy
balance/redistribution in the interstellar medium of nearby galaxies.
Millimeter interferometers are able to unveil the strong chemical
differentiation present in the molecular gas disks of nearby starbursts and
AGNs. Nearby active galaxies can be used as local templates to address the
study of more distant galaxies where both star formation and AGN activity are
deeply embedded.

the lymphocytes kill only viruses for which they have been designed. We
consider also the mutation and multiplication of the virus. An original
infection term is derived. So as to compare our system of differential
equations with well-known models, we study some of them and compare their
predictions to ours in the reduced case of only one antigenicity. In this
particular case, our model does not yield any major qualitative difference. We
prove mathematically that, in this case, our model is biologically consistent

In this paper, we extend this method and explore various applications of it,
using both simulations of and real data from the SDSS. In addition to
estimating the redshift distribution for an entire sample, the weighting method
enables accurate estimates of the redshift probability distribution, p(z), for
each galaxy in a photometric sample. Use of p(z) in cosmological analyses can
substantially reduce biases associated with traditional photometric redshifts,
in which a single redshift estimate is associated with each galaxy. The
weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in the photometric
sample are expected to have accurate redshift estimates, namely those that lie
in regions of photometric-observable space that are well sampled by the
spectroscopic subsample. In addition to providing a method that has some
advantages over standard photo-z estimates, the weights method can also be used
in conjunction with photo-z estimates, e.g., by providing improved estimation
of N(z) via deconvolution of N(photo-z) and improved estimates of photo-z
scatter and bias. We present a publicly available p(z) catalog for ~78 million

most important, and most difficult, questions remaining in the neutrino sector.
Searches for neutrinoless double beta-decay may help to resolve this question,
but are also sensitive to new, higher dimension Delta L=2 operators. In this
paper we place two phenomenological constraints on these operators at dimension
d<=11. First, we require that the operators obey the quark flavor symmetries of
the Standard Model, with any violation of the symmetries being due to Yukawa
interactions, a scheme known as Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV). Second, we
require that the operators which generate neutrinoless double beta-decay, and
any operators related by the flavor symmetries, do not induce neutrino masses
above 0.05 eV, the limit implied by the atmospheric neutrino data. We find that
these requirements severely constrain the operators which can violate lepton
number, such that most can no longer contribute to neutrinoless double
beta-decay at observable rates. It is noteworthy that quark flavor symmetries
can play such a strong role in constraining new leptonic physics, even when
that physics is not quark flavor changing. Those few operators that can mimic a
Majorana neutrino mass then appear with cutoffs below a TeV, and represent new
physics which could be directly probed at the LHC or a future linear collider.

not fall on the extension of the rather steep relation of the giants. Under the
assumption that the light profile shape varies continuously with magnitude, a
curved relation of size and magnitude would be expected. While the galaxies do
roughly follow this trend overall, we find that the dwarf galaxies are
significantly larger and the low-luminosity giants are significantly smaller
than what is predicted. We come to the conclusion that in this scaling relation
there is not one common sequence from dwarfs to giants, but a dichotomy which
can not be resolved by varying profile shapes. The comparison of our data to a

metallicity of the Cepheids. In this work, infrared observations of LMC
Cepheids from the SAGE survey are combined with OGLE II optical observation to
model and predict mass-loss rates. The mass-loss rates are fit to the data and
are predicted to range from about 10^{-12} to 10^{-7}M_\odot/yr; however, the
rates depend on the assumed value of the dust-to-gas ratio. By comparing the
relations derived from observations to the relations derived from predicted
infrared stellar luminosities from the mass-loss model, it is shown mass loss
affects the structure and scatter of the infrared Period-Luminosity relation.
Mass loss produces shallower slopes of the infrared relations and a lower zero
point. There is also evidence for non-linearity in the predicted
Period-Luminosity relations, and it is argued that mass loss produces larger
infrared excess at lower periods, which affects the slope and zero point,
making the PL relations more linear in the wavelength range of 3.6 to 5.8
micron. Because the dust-to-gas ratio is metallicity dependent and mass loss
may have a metallicity dependence, infrared Period-Luminosity relations have
additional uncertainty due to metallicity.

(such as axions and axion-like particles) with a much greater sensitivity, over
a broad particle mass range than is currently reachable by terrestrial
experiments and indirect astrophysical bounds. In particular, we study the
effect of splitting of photon-boson beams under intense magnetic field
gradients in magnetars and show that radio pulses (at meter wavelengths) may be
split and shift by a discernible phase down to a photon-boson coupling constant
of g ~ 1e-14 [1/GeV]; i.e., about four orders of magnitude lower than current
upper limits on g. The effect increases linearly with photon wavelength with
split pulses having equal fluxes and similar polarizations. These properties
make the identification of beam-splitting and beam deflection effects
straightforward with currently available data. Better understanding of radio
emission from magnetars is, however, required to confidently exclude regions in
the parameter space when such effects are not observed.

quasiparticle excitations, and so quantum kinetic equations do not describe the
transport properties completely. The theory shows that the transport
co-efficients are not proportional to a mean free scattering time (as is the
case in the Boltzmann theory of quasiparticles), but are completely determined
by the absolute temperature and by equilibrium thermodynamic observables.
Recently, explicit solutions of this quantum critical dynamics have become
possible via the AdS/CFT duality discovered in string theory. This shows that
the quantum critical theory provides a holographic description of the quantum
theory of black holes in a negatively curved anti-de Sitter space, and relates
its transport co-efficients to properties of the Hawking radiation from the
black hole. We review how insights from this connection have led to new results
for experimental systems: (i) the vicinity of the superfluid-insulator
transition in the presence of an applied magnetic field, and its possible
application to measurements of the Nernst effect in the cuprates, (ii) the
magnetohydrodynamics of the plasma of Dirac electrons in graphene and the
prediction of a hydrodynamic cyclotron resonance.

group galaxies are an extremely homogeneous population, confined nearly
exclusively to the red sequence: they are best described as `red and dead'

heterogeneous, due to bluer, star-forming, gas-rich, late-type galaxies
incorrectly identified as compact group members. These models suggest that
selection of members by redshift, such that the line-of-sight velocity

temperatures, we demonstrate that the quantum confined Stark effect can be
employed to quickly and reversibly switch the dot-cavity coupling simply by
varying a gate voltage. Our results show that exciton transitions from
individual dots can be tuned by ~4 meV relative to the nanocavity mode before
the emission quenches due to carrier tunneling escape. This range is much
larger than the typical linewidth of the high-Q cavity modes (~0.10 meV)
allowing us to explore and contrast regimes where the dots couple to the cavity
or decay by spontaneous emission into the 2D photonic bandgap. In the weak
coupling regime, we show that the dot spontaneous emission rate can be tuned
using a gate voltage, with Purcell factors >=7. New information is obtained on
the nature of the dot-cavity coupling in the weak coupling regime and
electrical control of zero dimensional polaritons is demonstrated for the
highest-Q cavities (Q>=12000). Vacuum Rabi splittings up to ~0.13 meV are

progressive softening of an incommensurate phonon near the zone boundary as the

peak which gets asymmetrical as well when going towards the transition
temperature. These features are in agreement with the experimental inelastic

  Deep HI and optical (i'-band) observations are presented. The HI observations
strongly suggest that the gaseous structure of NGC 2685 does not consist of two
separate mutually inclined regions, but forms a coherent, extremely warped
disk, the appearance of two rings being due to projection effects. By comparing
the HI total-intensity maps with the optical image we demonstrate that at large
radii a faint stellar disk is well aligned with the outer HI disk. The shape of
the dust-lanes obscuring the NE part of the inner stellar body indicates that
also at smaller radii NGC 2685 possesses a disk containing gas, dust, and stars
in which the various constituents are aligned. At smaller radii, this disk is
kinematically decoupled from the central stellar body. Hence, in the region of
the bright, central stellar body, NGC 2685 appears to consist of two disks that
share a common centre, but have different orientation: a bright stellar
lenticular body apparently devoid of dust and gas, and a heavily warped
low-surface brightness disk containing stars, gas and dust. The
low-surface-brightness disk changes its orientation gradually and at large
radii assumes the orientation of the central stellar S0 disk. Since, according
to our analysis, the intrinsic orientation of the low-surface-brightness disk
changes through 70 degrees, the gaseous disk is coherent, and is at no radius
orientated perpendicularly with respect to the central stellar body, NGC 2685
is likely not a classical polar-ring galaxy.

  $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}c_k\exp(-zg(k)), \Re(z)>0$ as $z$ approaches the
boundary $i\RR$, under the assumption $g'\to\infty$ and further assumptions on
$c_k$. These series occur in many applications in Fourier analysis, infinite
order differential operators, number theory and holomorphic dynamics among
others. For relatively general series with $c_k=1$, the case we primarily focus
on, we obtain blow up rates in measure along the imaginary line and asymptotic
information at $z=0$. When sufficient analyticity information on $g$ exists, we
obtain Borel summable expansions at points on the boundary, giving exact local
description. Borel summability of the expansions provides property-preserving
extensions beyond the barrier. The singular behavior has remarkable
universality and self-similarity features. If $g(k)=k^b$, $c_k=1$, $b=n$ or
$b=(n+1)/n$, $n\in\NN$, behavior near the boundary is roughly of the standard
form $\Re(z)^{-b'}Q(x)$ where $Q(x)=1/q$ if $x=p/q\in\QQ$ and zero otherwise.
The B\""otcher map at infinity of polynomial iterations of the form
$x_{n+1}=\lambda P(x_n)$, $|\lambda|<\lambda_0(P)$, turns out to have uniformly
convergent Fourier expansions in terms of simple lacunary series. For the
quadratic map $P(x) =x-x^2$, $\lambda_0=1$, and the Julia set is the graph of
this Fourier expansion in the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.

with the PHENIX detector. The invariant mass distribution of e+e- pairs in p+p
is consistent with the expected contributions from Dalitz decays of light
hadrons, dielectron decays of vector mesons and correlated charm production,
which have been measured in the same experiment. The charm and bottom cross
section extracted from the measured dielectron yield are sigma_cc = 544 +/-

2.4(stat.) +3/-2(syst.) microbarns, respectively.

is enhanced by a factor of 4.0 +/- 0.3(stat.) +/- 1.5(syst.) +/- 0.8(model)
compared to the known hadronic sources. The excess dominates the yield in the
transverse momentum region below 1 GeV/c and shows significantly lower average
p_T than the expected sources. The low p_T enhancement is currently not
understood by any theoretical model of heavy ion collisions. The enhancement
extends to larger transverse momenta where it is also observed in p+p and
explained by virtual direct photons. The p+p measurement serves as an important
test to pQCD calculations of direct photon production from hard scattering
processes in this momentum range. An excess with an inverse slope of T_eff =
221 +/- 23(stat.) +/- 18(syst.) MeV is observed in central Au+Au collisions
above the binary scaled direct photon yield in p+p. This can be qualitatively
explained by hydrodynamical models including thermal photon radiation with
initial temperatures of 300 - 600 MeV and formation times of 0.12 - 0.6 fm/c.

non-identical systems is presented. We study the entanglement evolution of two
remote atoms interacting independently with a cavity field, as in the double
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model. The four-qubit pairwise concurrences are studied,
allowing for asymmetric atom-cavity couplings and off-resonant ineractions.
Counter to intuition, imperfect matching can prove advantageous to entanglement
creation and evolution. For two types of initial entanglement, corresponding to
spin correlated and anti-correlated Bell states \Phi and \Psi, a full, periodic
and directed transfer of entanglement into a specific qubit pair is possible,
for resonant interactions, depending on the choice of relative couplings.
Furthermore, entanglement transfer and sudden death (ESD) can be prevented
using off-resonant interactions, although for some initial states, detunings
will trigger an otherwise frozen entanglement, to allow a full entanglement
transfer. We confirm a conservation rule governing the pairwise entanglement
between the non-interacting systems, that for the initial state \Psi the sum of
the square of these concurrences (SSC) is conserved. For \Phi, the total SSC is
reduced periodically, even to zero in some cases, to reveal a complete and
abrupt loss of all non-local pairwise entanglement.

such a phenomenon is likely to be governed by the non-Newtonian properties of
the magma. We focus on the statistical distribution of the lifespans of the

exhibits a characteristic time whereas, interestingly, the flue lifespan
displays a decaying power-law distribution. The associated exponent, which is

energy is conserved and the theory admits unitary time evolution. The behavior
changes if bound states are present, because each such state generates a kind
of damped harmonic oscillator in the spectrum of the field. These oscillators
lead to the breakdown of time translation invariance. We study in both regimes
the electromagnetic conductance of the Luttinger liquid on the quantum wire
junction. We derive an explicit expression for the conductance in terms of the
scattering matrix and show that antibound and bound states have a different
impact, giving raise to oscillations with exponentially damped and growing

submillimeter-selected galaxies reliably identified through CO emission and
also some of the most luminous known. In terms of CO to bolometric
luminosities, stellar mass and star formation rates (SFRs), these newly
discovered z>4 SMGs are similar to z~1.5-3 SMGs studied to date. These z~4 SMGs
have much higher specific SFRs than typical B-band dropout Lyman break galaxies
at the same redshift. The stellar mass-SFR correlation for normal galaxies does
not seem to evolve much further, between z~2 and z~4. A significant z=4.05
spectroscopic redshift spike is observed in GOODS-N, and a strong spatial
overdensity of B-band dropouts and IRAC selected z>3.5 galaxies appears to be
centered on the GN20 and GN20.2 galaxies. This suggests a proto-cluster
structure with total mass ~10^14 Msun. Using photometry at mid-IR, submm and
radio wavelengths, we show that reliable photometric redshifts (Dz/(1+z)~0.1)
can be derived for SMGs over 1<z<4. This new photometric redshift technique has
been used to provide a first estimate of the space density of 3.5<z<6

substantially to the SFR density at early epochs. Many of these high-redshift
starbursts will be within reach of Herschel. We find that the radio to mid-IR

submm/mm emission [abridged].

minerals with the most pronounced bands in the far infrared (FIR) spectral
region. Given that Herschel and ALMA will open up new possibilities for
astronomical FIR and sub-mm spectroscopy, data characterizing the dielectric
properties of these materials at long wavelengths are desirable. We aimed at
examining the FIR spectra of talc, picrolite, montmorillonite, and chamosite,
which belong to four different groups of phyllosilicates. We tabulated
positions and band widths of the FIR bands of these minerals depending on the
dust temperature. By means of powder transmission spectroscopy, spectra of the
examined materials were measured in the wavelength range 25-500 mum at
temperatures of 300, 200, 100, and 10 K. Room-temperature measurements yield
the following results. For talc, a previously unknown band, centered at 98.5
mum, was found, in addition to bands at 56.5 and 59.5 mum. For montmorillonite,
several bands at wavelengths <110 mum were detected, including a band at 105
mum with an FWHM of about 10 mum. Picrolite shows a sharp 77 mum FIR band.
Chamosite is characterized by bands in the 72-92 mum range, and a prominent
band at 277 mum. At decreasing temperature, most of the bands shift to shorter
wavelengths. Examining a potential counterpart of the 105mum band in the
spectra of HD 142527 and HD 100546, we find that the broad band in the spectra
of these young stars - extending from 85 to 125 mum - cannot be due to
montmorillonite or any of the hydrous silicates we studied, since these
materials have sharper bands in the FIR wavelength range than previously
assumed, especially at low temperatures.

magnetic fields in galaxies in the light of present models of formation and
evolution of galaxies. Methods. We use the dynamo theory to derive the
timescales of amplification and ordering of magnetic fields in disk and puffy
galaxies. Turbulence in protogalactic halos generated by thermal virialization
can drive an efficient turbulent dynamo. Results from simulations of
hierarchical structure formation cosmology provide a tool to develop an
evolutionary model of regular magnetic fields coupled with galaxy formation and
evolution. Results. The turbulent (small-scale) dynamo was able to amplify a
weak seed magnetic field in halos of protogalaxies to a few muG strength within
a few 10^8 yr. This turbulent field served as a seed to the mean-field
(large-scale) dynamo. Galaxies similar to the Milky Way formed their disks at
z~10 and regular fields of muG strength and a few kpc coherence length were
generated within 2 Gyr (at z~3), but field-ordering on the coherence scale of
the galaxy size required an additional 6 Gyr (at z~0.5). Giant galaxies formed
their disks at z~10, allowing more efficient dynamo generation of strong
regular fields (with kpc coherence length) already at z~4. However, the age of
the Universe is short for fully coherent fields in giant galaxies larger than
15 kpc to have been achieved. Dwarf galaxies should have hosted fully coherent
fields at z~1. After a major merger, the strength of the turbulent field is
enhanced by a factor of a few. Conclusions. This evolutionary scenario can be
tested by measurements of polarized synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation
with the planned SKA. We predict an anticorrelation between galaxy size and
ratio between ordering scale and galaxy size (abridged).

VLT/VIMOS spectroscopy with Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging. The radial velocity
distribution of $\sim 500$ cluster members is bounded by a pair of clearly
defined velocity caustics, with a maximum amplitude of $\sim|4000|$ km/s at
$\simeq$ 300 h$^{-1}$ kpc, beyond which the amplitude steadily declines,
approaching zero velocity at a limiting radius of $\sim$ 2 h$^{-1}$ Mpc. We
derive the 3D velocity anisotropy and galaxy number density profiles using a
model-independent method to solve the Jeans equation, simultaneously
incorporating the observed velocity dispersion profile, the galaxy counts from
deep Subaru imaging, and our previously derived cluster mass profile from a
joint lensing and X-ray analysis. The velocity anisotropy is found to be
predominantly radial at large radius, becoming increasingly tangential towards
the center, in accord with expectations. We also analyze the galaxy data
independently of our previous analysis using two different methods: The first
is based on a solution of the Jeans equation assuming an NFW form for the mass
distribution, whereas in the second method the caustic amplitude is used to
determine the escape velocity. The cluster virial mass derived by both of these
dynamical methods is in good agreement with results from our earlier lensing
and X-ray analysis. We also confirm the high NFW concentration parameter, with
results from both methods combined to yield $c_{\rm vir}>13$ (1$\sigma$). The
inferred virial radius is consistent with the limiting radius where the
caustics approach zero velocity and where the counts of cluster members drop
off, suggesting that infall onto A1689 is currently not significant.

players can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths
than by acting in isolation. A fundamental problem for coalitional games is to
single out the most desirable outcomes in terms of appropriate notions of worth
distributions, which are usually called solution concepts. Motivated by the
fact that decisions taken by realistic players cannot involve unbounded
resources, recent computer science literature reconsidered the definition of
such concepts by advocating the relevance of assessing the amount of resources
needed for their computation in terms of their computational complexity. By
following this avenue of research, the paper provides a complete picture of the
complexity issues arising with three prominent solution concepts for
coalitional games with transferable utility, namely, the core, the kernel, and
the bargaining set, whenever the game worth-function is represented in some
reasonable compact form (otherwise, if the worths of all coalitions are
explicitly listed, the input sizes are so large that complexity problems
are---artificially---trivial). The starting investigation point is the setting
of graph games, about which various open questions were stated in the
literature. The paper gives an answer to these questions, and in addition
provides new insights on the setting, by characterizing the computational
complexity of the three concepts in some relevant generalizations and
specializations.

used to find the interaction of the cantilever tip with the surface. In the
specific context of the attractive van der Waals interaction, this method can
be realized as a new method of measuring the Hamaker constant for materials.
The Hamaker constant is determined from the deflection of the cantilever at the
jump-into-contact using the force constant of the cantilever and the tip radius
of curvature, all of which can be obtained by measurements. The results have
been verified experimentally on a sample of cleaved mica, a sample of Si wafer
with natural oxide and a silver film, using a number of cantilevers with

both cases, the objective was to derive conditions of convergence of such

the goal here is to derive conditions under which chaotic iterations admit a
chaotic behaviour in a rigorous mathematical sense. Contrary to what has been
studied in the literature, convergence is not desired.
  More precisely, we establish in this paper a link between the concept of
chaotic iterations on a finite set and the notion of topological chaos [8],
[6], [7]. We are motivated by concrete applications of our approach, such as
the use of chaotic boolean iterations in the computer security field. Indeed,
the concept of chaos is used in many areas of data security without real
rigorous theoretical foundations, and without using the fundamental properties
that allow chaos.

its dynamics is well understood when the phase space is a vector space over a
finite field. The cycle structure of such a system can be described by the
elementary divisors of the linear function, and the problem of determining
whether the system is a fixed point system can be answered by computing and
factoring the system's characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial. It has
become clear recently that the study of finite linear dynamical systems must be
extended to embrace finite rings. The difficulty of dealing with an arbitrary
finite commutative ring is that it lacks of unique factorization. In this
paper, an efficient algorithm is provided for analyzing the cycle structure of
a linear dynamical system over a finite commutative ring. In particular, for a
given commutative ring $R$ such that $|R|=q$, where $q$ is a positive integer,
the algorithm determines whether a given linear system over $R^n$ is a fixed

from heavy-light Schroedinger functional correlation functions and computed
over a range of renormalization group invariant heavy quark masses from the
charm to beyond the bottom region, allow for a quantitative comparison with the
predictions of HQET and are of practical relevance for solving renormalization
problems in HQET non-perturbatively by a matching to QCD in finite volume.

References added and title changed",,,,"math.AC math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It was proved by Beligiannis and Krause that over certain Artin algebras,
there are Gorenstein flat modules which are not direct limits of finitely
generated Gorenstein projective modules. That is, these algebras have no
Gorenstein analogue of the Govorov-Lazard Theorem.
  We show that, in fact, there is a large class of rings without such an
analogue. Namely, let R be a commutative local noetherian ring. Then the
analogue fails for R if it has a dualizing complex, is henselian, not
Gorenstein, and has a finitely generated Gorenstein projective module which is
not free.
  The proof is based on a theory of Gorenstein projective (pre)envelopes. We
show, among other things, that the finitely generated Gorenstein projective
modules form an enveloping class in mod R if and only if R is Gorenstein or has
the property that each finitely generated Gorenstein projective module is free.
  This is analogous to a recent result on covers by Christensen, Piepmeyer,
Striuli, and Takahashi, and their methods are an important input to our work.

This is direct evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. This discovery
has renewed interest in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
experiments which provide the only practical way to determine whether neutrinos
are Majorana or Dirac particles. Such experiments also have the potential to
determine the absolute scale of the neutrino mass and help resolve the neutrino
mass hierarchy question. The NEMO-3 (Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory) is
currently one of the most sensitive searches for neutrinoless double beta
decay. The main goal of SuperNEMO is to extend the sensitivity of the NEMO-3
search for neutrinoless double beta decay (and to measure two-neutrino double
beta $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay). The two isotopes under consideration for
SuperNEMO are $^{82}$Se and $^{150}$Nd. The target sensitivity is a
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life at the level of $10^{26}$ years which will
explore the degenerate neutrino mass hierarchy down to 50 meV.

problem was studied for multi-unit auctions with unit demand bidders and for
the public project problem, and in each case social welfare undominated
mechanisms in the class of feasible and incentive compatible mechanisms were
identified. One way to improve upon these optimality results is by allowing the
players to move sequentially. With this in mind, we study here sequential
versions of two feasible Groves mechanisms used for single item auctions: the
Vickrey auction and the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism. Because of the absence of
dominant strategies in this sequential setting, we focus on a weaker concept of
an optimal strategy. For each mechanism we introduce natural optimal strategies
and observe that in each mechanism these strategies exhibit different
behaviour. However, we then show that among all optimal strategies, the one we
introduce for each mechanism maximizes the social welfare when each player
follows it. The resulting social welfare can be larger than the one obtained in
the simultaneous setting. Finally, we show that, when interpreting both
mechanisms as simultaneous ones, the vectors of the proposed strategies form a
Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium in the class of optimal strategies.
