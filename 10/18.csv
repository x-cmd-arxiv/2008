final asymmetry in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric cases with a
simple dependence on each parameter. The low-energy parameters factorize from
the high-energy ones, and the high-energy phase must be non-zero. The role of
the PMNS phases is carefully studied. Moreover, we find that the breaking
parameter in the Yukawa coupling matrix must be relatively large, \epsilon_h >
10^{-3} for normal and 10^{-2} for inverted hierarchy. Therefore, leptogenesis
in our simple model is incompatible with RH neutrino signals at future
colliders or sizable lepton-flavor violation. The other breaking parameter,
\epsilon_M, which appears in the RH neutrino mass matrix, can be much smaller,

structures form and evolve within the LMC. For the analysis we use Fractured
Minimum Spanning Trees, the statistical Q parameter, and the two-point
correlation function. Restricting our analysis to young massive (OB) stars we
confirm our results obtained for M33, namely that the luminosity function of
the groups is well described by a power-law with index -2, and that there is no
characteristic length-scale of star-forming regions. We find that stars in the
LMC are born with a large amount of substructure, consistent with a 2D fractal
distribution with dimension ~1.8 and evolve towards a uniform distribution on a
timescale of ~175 Myr. This is comparable to the crossing time of the galaxy
and we suggest that stellar structure, regardless of spatial scale, will be
eliminated in a crossing time. This may explain the smooth distribution of
stars in massive/dense young clusters in the Galaxy, while other, less massive,
clusters still display large amounts of structure at similar ages. By comparing
the stellar and star cluster distributions and evolving timescales, we show
that infant mortality of clusters (or 'popping clusters') have a negligible
influence on galactic structure. Finally, we quantify the influence of the
elongation, differential extinction, and contamination of a population on the

trapped within long lived high pressure regions, creating opportunities for
collapse into planetesimals and planetary embryos. We study the accumulations
in the stable Lagrangian points of a giant planet, as well as in the Rossby
vortices launched at the edges of the gap it carves. We employ the Pencil Code,
tracing the solids with a large number of interacting Lagrangian particles,
usually 100,000. For particles of 1 cm to 10 cm radii, gravitational collapse
occurs in the Lagrangian points in less than 200 orbits. For 5 cm particles, a
2 Earth mass planet is formed. For 10 cm, the final maximum collapsed mass is
around 3 Earth masses. The collapse of the 1 cm particles is indirect,
following the timescale of depletion of gas from the tadpole orbits. In the
edges of the gap vortices are excited, trapping preferentially particles of 30
cm radii. The rocky planet that is formed is as massive as 17 Earth masses,
constituting a Super-Earth. By using multiple particle species, we find that
gas drag modifies the streamlines in the tadpole region around the classical L4
and L5 points. As a result, particles of different radii have their stable
points shifted to different locations. Collapse therefore takes longer and
produces planets of lower mass. Three super-Earths are formed in the vortices,
the most massive having 4.4 Earth masses. We conclude that a Jupiter mass
planet can induce the formation of other planetary embryos in the outer edge of
its gas gap. Trojan Earth mass planets are readily formed, and although not
existing in the solar system, might be common in the exoplanetary zoo.

scale-free self-organisation phenomena emerging in complex nervous systems at a
mesoscale level, there has been significant search for suitable models and
theoretical explanations in neuroscientific literature, see the recent survey
by Bullmore and Sporns (2009). In Piekniewski and Schreiber (2008) we have
developed a simple and tractable mathematical model shedding some light on a
particular class of the afore-mentioned phenomena, namely on mesoscopic level
self-organisation of functional brain networks under fMRI imaging, where we
have achieved a high degree of agreement with existing empirical reports. Being
addressed to the neuroscientific community, our work Piekniewski and Schreiber
(2008) relied on semi-rigorous study of information flow structure in a class
of recurrent neural networks exhibiting asymptotic scale-free behaviour and
admitting a description in terms of the so-called winner-take-all dynamics. The
purpose of the present paper is to define and study these winner-take-all
networks with full mathematical rigour in context of their asymptotic spectral
properties, well known to be of interest for neuroscientific community. Our
main result is a limit theorem for spectra of the spike-flow graphs induced by
the winner-take-all dynamics. We provide an explicit characterisation of the
limit spectral measure expressed in terms of zeros of Bessel's J-function.

that at high $p_T$ the nuclear modification factor for direct photons
$R_{AA}^{\gamma} (p_T) < 1$ is dominated by cold nuclear matter effects and
there is no evidence for large cross section amplification due to
medium-induced photon bremsstrahlung and jet-photon conversion in the medium.

in the current experimental data cannot provide further constraints on the

chiral multiplets, for all N_c we identify a ""colour-flavour locked"" symmetry,
SO(3)_{C+F} which leaves the Higgs vacuum invariant. At weak coupling, we find
explicit non-Abelian k-vortex solutions carrying a Z_{N_c}-valued magnetic
flux, with winding, 0 < k < N_c. These k-strings spontaneously break
SO(3)_{C+F} to U(1)_{C+F} resulting in an S^2 moduli space of solutions. The
world-sheet sigma model is a nonsupersymmetric CP^1 model with a theta angle
\theta_{1+1} = k(N_c-k)\theta_{3+1} where \theta_{3+1} is the Yang-Mills vacuum
angle. We find numerically that k-vortex tensions follow the Casimir scaling
law T_k \propto k (N_c-k) for large N_c. In the large N_c IIB string dual, the
SO(3)_{C+F} symmetry is manifest in the geometry interpolating between AdS_5 x
S^5 and the interior metric due to a single D5-brane carrying D3-brane charge.
We identify candidate k-vortices as expanded probe D3-branes formed from a
collection of k D-strings. The resulting k-vortex tension exhibits precise
Casimir scaling, and the effective world-sheet theta angle matches the
semiclassical result. S-duality maps the Higgs to the confining phase so that
confining string tensions at strong 't Hooft coupling also exhibit Casimir
scaling in N=1^* theory in the large N_c limit.

pairs. These sources properly account for the dimuons produced in
proton-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we show that dimuons are also
produced in excess in 158 A GeV In-In collisions. We furthermore observe, by
tagging the dimuon vertices, that this excess is not due to enhanced D meson
production, but made of prompt muon pairs, as expected from a source of thermal
dimuons specific to high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The yield of this
excess increases significantly from peripheral to central collisions, both with
respect to the Drell-Yan yield and to the number of nucleons participating in
the collisions. Furthermore, the transverse mass distributions of the excess
dimuons are well described by an exponential function, with inverse slope
values around 190 MeV. The values are independent of mass and significantly
lower than those found at masses below 1 GeV/c^2, rising there up to 250 MeV
due to radial flow. This suggests the emission source of thermal dimuons above
1 GeV/c^2 to be of largely partonic origin, when radial flow has not yet built
up.

ultraviolet luminosity of the background quasar can be severely diminished.
When the spectrum is redshifted, this leads to a bias in optical surveys for
DLAs. Previous estimates of the magnitude of this effect are in some tension;
in particular, the distribution of DLAs in the column-density -- metallicity
plane has led to claims that we may be missing a considerable fraction of metal
rich, high column density DLAs, whereas radio surveys do not unveil a
substantial population of otherwise hidden systems. Motivated by this tension,
we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis of a simple dust
obscuration model. We include radio and optical observations of DLAs in our
overall likelihood analysis and show that these do not, in fact, constitute
conflicting constraints.
  Our model gives statistical limits on the biasing effects of dust, predicting
that only 7% of DLAs are missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration;
at 2 sigma confidence, this figure takes a maximum value of 17%. This contrasts
with recent claims that DLA incidence rates are underestimated by 30 -- 50%.
Optical measures of the mean metallicities of DLAs are found to underestimate
the true value by just 0.1 dex (or at most 0.4 dex, 2 sigma confidence limit),
in agreement with the radio survey results of Akerman et al. The quantity most
affected by dust biasing is the total cosmic density of metals in DLAs,
Omega_{Z,DLA}, which is underestimated in optical surveys by a factor of
approximately two.

The index-sigma relations for our sample, including galaxies with sigma<100

two types of relations for the metallic indices: one showing a break in the
slope around ~100 km/s, and another group with strong linear relations between
an index and log sigma. We find no connection between the behavior of
index-sigma relations with either alpha- or Fe-peak elements. However, we find
indications that the relations are tighter for indices which do not depend on
the micro-turbulent velocities of stellar atmospheres. We confirm previous
results that low-sigma galaxies including dE/dS0s are on average younger, less
metal rich, and have lower [alpha/Fe] in comparison to E/S0s. Our data show
that these trends derived for high-sigma galaxies extend down to dE/dS0s. This
is a factor of ~2 lower in sigma than previously published work. We confirm
that the observed anti-correlation between age and metallicity for high-sigma
galaxies is consistent with the effects of correlated errors. Low-sigma
galaxies also show a similar relation between age and metallicity as a result
of correlated errors. However, they are offset from this relationship so that,
on average, they are less metal rich and younger than their high-sigma
counterparts.

correlations and higher (n-particle irreducible) effective actions. As an
example, we investigate three and fourth order correlations by adding
stochastic sources to the Schwinger - Dyson equations derived from the
2-particle irreducible effective. This method is a simple way to investigate
the nonlinear dynamics of quantum fluctuations.

which has been optimized as an age indicator for old and intermediate age
stellar populations. Rather than using stellar spectra, we employed for this
purpose a library of stellar population SEDs of different ages and
metallicities at moderately high spectral resolution. H$_{\beta_o}$ provides us
with improved abilities for lifting the age-metallicity degeneracy affecting
the standard Hbeta Lick index definition. The new index, which has also been
optimized against photon noise and velocity dispersion, is fully characterized
with wavelength shift, spectrum shape, dust extinction and [alpha/Fe] abundance
ratio effects. H_\beta requires spectra of similar qualites as those commonly
used for measuring the standard Hbeta Lick index definition. Aiming at
illustrating the use and capabilities of H$_{\beta_o}$ as an age indicator we
apply it to Milky Way globular clusters and to a well selected sample of
early-type galaxies covering a wide range in mass. The results shown here are
particularly useful for applying this index and understand the involved

use the H-alpha emission line to study the wind, which appears as pronounced
blueshifted P-Cygni absorption troughs whose low velocity end contaminates the
blue side of the emission line profile. The wind appears to be episodic in
nature, with multiple events reaching velocities of 5000km/sec in H-alpha.
Similar (but weaker) wind signatures appear in the HeI5876AA line but are
absent in HeI6678AA. Our data suggest that during wind episodes the wind is
phase dependent and is visible for half the orbit of the system. Considering
that V592 Cas is viewed almost face-on, the symmetry axis of the outflow can
not be orthogonal to the disk and/or the outflow must have some other inherent
asymmetry in outflow geometry. A possible origin of the wind is in a disk
hotspot, either at the initial impact point of the accretion stream on the disk
edge or as a result of disk overflow (similar to SW Sextantis stars).
Simultaneous optical photometry during one night of our spectroscopic
observations indicate that there is no clear relationship between the optical
brightness variations and the strength of the outflow in this system.

confined pair of constituent quark and antiquark, which in our work is written

implying in confined quarks with the property that the sum of the constituents
masses can be larger than the mass of the meson. The one-loop expressions of
the electroweak transition amplitudes are conveniently written in terms of
light-front momentum. Technically, we introduce a Wick-rotation of he minus

avoid the cuts in the complex plane of this momentum variable without crossing
them. This is particularly useful as we can study the electroweak properties

regulators. The possibility to change the power of the BS amplitude is
interesting in order to test the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic

which are non-zero at the special point $s = 0$, and was conjectured by Brumer
to give annihilators of class-groups viewed as Galois modules. An earlier

include $L$-functions with a simple zero at $s = 0$, and was shown by the
present author to provide class-group annihilators not existing in the

$L$-functions of arbitrary order of vanishing at $s = 0$, and we give evidence
using results of Popescu and Rubin that it is closely related to the Fitting
ideal of the class-group, a canonical ideal of annihilators. Finally, we prove

quantum criticality in regular and disordered interacting Bose systems is
given, concentrating on general features and important symmetries that are
exhibited in different parts of the phase diagram, and that govern the
different possible types of critical behavior. A number of exact results for
various insulating phase boundaries, which may be used to constrain the results
of numerical simulations, can be derived using large rare region type
arguments. The nature of the insulator-superfluid transition is explored
through general scaling arguments, exact model calculations in one dimension,
numerical results in two dimensions, and approximate renormalization group
results in higher dimensions. Experiments on He-4 adsorbed in porous Vycor
glass, on thin film superconductors, and magnetically trapped atomic vapors in
a periodic optical potential, are used to illustrate many of the concepts.

their contribution to the mid-infrared emission, the most abundant minerals for
G29-38 are amorphous carbon, amorphous and crystalline silicates, water ice,
and metal sulfides. The amorphous C can be equivalently replaced by other
materials (like metallic Fe) with featureless infrared spectra. The
best-fitting crystalline silicate is Fe-rich pyroxene. In order to absorb
enough starlight to power the observed emission, the disk must either be much
thinner than the stellar radius (so that it can be heated from above and below)
or it must have an opening angle wider than 2 degrees. A `moderately optically
thick' torus model with mass 2x10^19 g fits the spectrum well. A physically
thin (less than the white dwarf radius) and optically thick disk can contribute
to the near-infrared continuum only; such a disk cannot explain the
longer-wavelength continuum or strong silicate features. The silicate
composition contains minerals found from cometary spectra and meteorites, but
Fe-rich pyroxene is more abundant than enstatite (Mg-rich pyroxene) or
forsterite (Mg-rich olivine) in G29-38, in contrast to what is found in most
comet or meteorite mineralogies. Enstatite meteorites may be the most similar
solar system materials to the G29-38 dust. Finally, we suggest the surviving

Topology-based alignments have the potential to provide a completely new,

minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints.
This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization
problem, and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering
a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem).
Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly
amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries.
  This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that
is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has
low rank. The algorithm is iterative and produces a sequence of matrices (X^k,
Y^k) and at each step, mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the
singular values of the matrix Y^k. There are two remarkable features making
this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the
soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that
the rank of the iterates X^k is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts
allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the
computational cost of each iteration low. We provide numerical examples in
which 1,000 by 1,000 matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest
desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very
large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a
billion unknowns from just about 0.4% of their sampled entries. Our methods are
connected with linearized Bregman iterations for l1 minimization, and we
develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of
well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.

shows that, in the unperturbed states, the atom has a permanent electric dipole
moment (EDM) of magnitude 3eao (ao is Bohr radius). The EDM is not induce by
the external field but is inherent behavior of the atom. But the calculation of
quantum mechanics tells us that unperturbed states of hydrogen atom have no
EDM! In the effect, two of four states have no energy shift. What are the EDM
of the hydrogen atoms in the two states? Quantum mechanics can not answer the
problem. The statement that the EDM of the two states is perpendicular to the
field only comes from guesses in quantum mechanics. The two problems had
puzzled physicists for more than 80 years. By introducing a new parameter this
article gives a satisfactory explanation for the effect. Our calculation
discovered that, in the unperturbed states, the atoms not only have EDM with
3eao but also can have only three directions of quantization! It is an entirely
unexpected discovery. This research is a vital clue that not all is well with
quantum mechanics. We prophesy that hydrogen-like atoms, such as K, Rb and Cs
atom etc, may have large EDM of the order of magnitude eao in their ground
state (see arXiv:0809.4767, arXiv:0810.0770 and arXiv:0810.2026).

in the central regions of galaxy groups requires a fairly strong pre-heating,
with K_fl>100 keV cm^2, the void statistics of the Lyman-alpha forest impose
that this pre-heating should take place only in relatively high-density
regions, in order not to destroy the cold filaments that give rise to the
forest. We conclude that any injection of non-gravitational energy in the
diffuse baryons should avoid low-density regions at high redshift and/or take
place at relatively low redshift.

structure of these Clifford graph algebras and provide many examples and
pictures. I describe which graphs correspond to isomorphic Clifford algebras
and also discuss other related sets of graphs. This construction can be used to
build models of representations of simply-laced compact Lie groups.

  Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008",,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All relevant inputs for the extraction of the CKM matrix element \vus from
\kl, \ks and \kpm decays have been measured at KLOE. From a global fit using
only KLOE results, but \ks lifetime, a value of $|\vus|\fzero = 0.2157 \pm
0.0006$ is obtained, where \fzero is the form factor parametrizing the hadronic
matrix element evaluated at zero momentum transfer. Comparison of the values of
\fVus for $K_{e3}$ and $K_{\mu3}$ modes provides a test of lepton universality
at 0.8% level of accuracy. The value $\vus/\vud=0.2323(15)$ has been obtained
from the ratio $\Gamma(K\to\mu \nu)/\Gamma(\pi\to\mu \nu)$ using KLOE
measurement of $\BR(\kpm \to \mudue)$ and lattice calculation of the ratio of
decay constants $f_K/f_{\pi}$. These results, together with $\vud =
0.97418(26)$, are compatible at 0.6$\sigma$ level with CKM matrix unitarity.
The universality of lepton and quark weak couplings can be tested and
constraints on new physics extensions of the Standard Model can be set using
these very precise measurements from kaon decays.
