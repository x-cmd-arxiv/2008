involves an asymptotically free gauge group SU(2)Z and an axion-like particle
with an SU(2)Z-instanton-induced potential which yields a scenario for the dark
energy. Furthermore, the extended particle content of this SU(2)Z model
contains a possible candidate for the cold dark matter, namely, the SU(2)Z
""shadow"" fermion, which couples with the Standard Model lepton through a scalar
""messenger field"" carrying both SU(2)Z and electroweak quantum numbers. Since
these shadow fermions are in a real representation of SU(2)Z, lepton number can
be violated in the Yukawa sector and a lepton number asymmetry can be generated
in the SU(2)Z particle's decay which is also CP-violating and
""out-of-equilibrium"". The asymmetry coming from the interference between the
tree-level and one-loop amplitudes was calculated for both messenger scalar and
shadow fermion decays. It turns out, in order to have a non-vanishing lepton
asymmetry and to be consistent with the unitarity condition, some shadow
fermions have to decay into lighter messenger scalars, hence could be a
candidate ""progenitor"" for the lepton asymmetry.

broad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational proficiency of the SGA
have been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to inductively infer a
computational proficiency of the SGA from a set of related computational
competencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two
computational competencies of the SGA. These competencies, when considered
together, point toward a remarkable computational proficiency of the SGA. This
proficiency is pertinent to a general problem that is closely related to a
well-known statistical problem at the cutting edge of computational genetics.

  Sky Survey Data Release 4, we measure the following four types of alignment
signals: (1) the alignment between the distributions of the satellites of each
group relative to the direction of the nearest neighbor group (NNG); (2) the
alignment between the major axis direction of the central galaxy of the host
group (HG) and the direction of the NNG; (3) the alignment between the major
axes of the central galaxies of the HG and the NNG; and (4) the alignment
between the major axes of the satellites of the HG and the direction of the
NNG. We find strong signal of alignment between the satellite distribution and
the orientation of central galaxy relative to the direction of the NNG, even
when the NNG is located beyond $3r_{\rm vir}$ of the host group. The major axis
of the central galaxy of the HG is aligned with the direction of the NNG. The
alignment signals are more prominent for groups that are more massive and with
early type central galaxies. We also find that there is a preference for the
two major axis of the central galaxies of the HG and NNG to be parallel for the
system with both early central galaxies, however not for the systems with both
late type central galaxies. For the orientation of satellite galaxies, we do
not find any significant alignment signals relative to the direction of the
NNG. From these four types of alignment measurements, we conclude that the
large scale environment traced by the nearby group affects primarily the shape
of the host dark matter halo, and hence also affects the distribution of
satellite galaxies and the orientation of central galaxies. (Shortened version)

hyperbolic partial differential equation which gives us a freedom for choosing
the initial wave function and its initial slope. By taking advantage of this

regime, the MTF may dramatically vary in their phase dependence. Resulting PSF
may have a sub-wavelength thickness as well as may be broad with multiple
maxima and a rapid phase modulation. We show that the width of PSF may be
reduced by further propagation in free space, and we provide arguments to

of string theory on certain curved backgrounds such as AdS_5xS^5 is required.
In this dissertation we make a step in this direction by focusing on RxS^3. It
was discovered in recent years that string theory on AdS_5xS^5 admits a Lax
formulation. However, the complete statement of integrability requires not only
the existence of a Lax formulation, but also that the resulting integrals of
motion are in pairwise involution. This idea is central to the first part of
this thesis. Exploiting this integrability we apply algebro-geometric methods
to string theory on RxS^3 and obtain the general finite-gap solution. The
construction is based on an invariant algebraic curve previously found in the
AdS_5xS^5 case. However, encoding the dynamics of the solution requires
specification of additional marked points. By restricting the symplectic
structure of the string to this algebro-geometric data we derive the
action-angle variables of the system. We then perform a first-principle
semiclassical quantisation of string theory on RxS^3 as a toy model for strings
on AdS_5xS^5. The result is exactly what one expects from the dual gauge theory
perspective, namely the underlying algebraic curve discretises in a natural
way. We also derive a general formula for the fluctuation energies around the
generic finite-gap solution. The ideas used can be generalised to AdS_5xS^5.
