spectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. Our technique
exploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies. Because structure in the
universe is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host a
central SMBH, some galaxies should possess two SMBHs near their centers as the
result of a recent merger. These SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant
merger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the
DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91
exhibit [O III] and Hbeta emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of
these, 32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different
from the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocity
offsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O
III] emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of
velocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of physical
models for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation is
inspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies. Based on this interpretation, we
find that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger
remnants, which implies that mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies.
The AGN velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a merger
rate of ~3 mergers/Gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 < z < 0.82.

However for iron fluoride systems F(2p) states were found to be separated in
energy from As(4p) ones in contrast to La111, where O(2p) states strongly
overlaps with As(4p). Thus it should be more plausible to include only Fe(3d)
and As(4p) orbitals into a realistic noninteracting model than for La111.
Moreover Sr substitution with smaller ionic radius Ca in AFFeAs materials leads
to a lattice contruction and stronger Fe(3d)-As(4p) hybridization resulting in
smaller value of the density of states at the Fermi level in the case of Ca
compound. So to some extend Ca system reminds RE111 with later Rare Earths.
However Fermi surface of new fluorides is found to be nearly perfect

heated by a strong shock wave produced when matter is ejected from the white
dwarf as the result of a thermonuclear explosion on its surface is the emission
source in the standard X-ray band. Comparison of the calculated and observed
time dependences of the mean radiation temperature and luminosity of the binary
system during its outburst has yielded very important characteristics of the
explosion.We have been able to measure the velocity of the ejected matter
immediately after the onset of the explosion for the first time: it follows
from our model that the ejected matter had a velocity of ~2700 km/s even on
0.1-0.5 day after the outburst onset and it flew with such a velocity for the
first 1-1.5 day under an external force, possibly, the radiation pressure from
the white dwarf. Subsequently, the matter probably became transparent and began
to decelerate. The time dependence of the mean radiation temperature at late
expansion phases has allowed us to estimate the mass of the ejected matter,
~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun. The mass loss rate in the stellar wind required to
explain the observed peak luminosity of the binary system during its outburst
has been estimated to be dM/dt ~(1-2)x10^{-6} Msun/yr.

fundamental CO emission taken with CRIRES on the VLT, we probe the
circumstellar gas and model the kinematics of the emission lines. By using
spectro-astrometry on the spatially resolved targets, we constrain the physical
size of the emitting regions in the disks. We resolve, spectrally and
spatially, the emission of the $^{13}$CO v(1-0) vibrational band and the
$^{12}$CO $v=1-0, v=2-1, v=3-2$ and $v=4-3$ vibrational bands in both targets,
as well as the $^{12}$CO $v=5-4$ band in HD 100546. Modeling of the CO emission
with a homogeneous disk in Keplerian motion, yields a best fit with an inner

97048. HD 100546 is not fit well with our model, but we derive a lower limit on
the inner radius of 8 AU. The fact that gaseous [OI] emission was previously
detected in both targets at significantly smaller radii suggests that CO may be
effectively destroyed at small radii in the surface layers of these disks

photometry of the pulsating subdwarf B star PG 1219+534 (KY UMa). Subdwarf B
stars are blue horizontal branch stars which have shed most of their hydrogen
envelopes. Pulsating subdwarf B stars allow a probe into this interesting phase
of evolution. Low resolution spectra were obtained at the Nordic Optical
Telescope and Kitt Peak National Observatory, and photometric observations were
obtained at MDM and Baker observatories in 2006. We extracted radial velocity
and equivalent width variations from several Balmer and He I lines in
individual spectra. The pulsation frequencies were separated via phase binning
to detect line-profile variations in Balmer and helium lines, which were
subsequently matched to atmospheric models to infer effective temperature and
gravity changes throughout the pulsation cycle.
  From the photometry we recovered the four previously observed frequencies and
detected a new fifth frequency. From the spectra we directly measured radial
velocity and equivalent width variations for the four main frequencies and from
atmospheric models we successfully inferred temperature and gravity changes for
these four frequencies. We compared amplitude ratios and phase differences of
these quantities and searched for outliers which could be identified as
high-degree modes. These are the first such measurements for a ""normal""
amplitude pulsating subdwarf B star, indicating that spectroscopic studies can
benefit the majority of pulsating subdwarf B stars.

repetition code with multiple accumulators connected through random

codes, asymptotic expressions for the minimum distance and an arbitrary number
of accumulators larger than one are derived using the uniform interleaver
approach. In accordance with earlier results in the literature, it is first
shown that the minimum distance of repeat-accumulate codes can grow, at best,
sublinearly with block length. Then, for repeat-accumulate-accumulate codes and
rates of 1/3 or less, it is proved that these codes exhibit asymptotically
linear distance growth with block length, where the gap to the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be made vanishingly small by increasing the number
of accumulators beyond two. In order to address larger rates, random puncturing
of a low-rate mother code is introduced. It is shown that in this case the
resulting ensemble of repeat-accumulate-accumulate codes asymptotically
achieves linear distance growth close to the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. This
holds even for very high rate codes.

compactified on a circle of radius R ($M^4\times S^1$ spacetime). Our starting
point is the Kaluza Klein decomposition of the 5D Maxwell action into a
massless sector containing the 4D Maxwell action and an extra massless scalar
field and a Proca sector containing 4D gauge fields with masses $m_n=n/R$ where
$n$ is a positive integer. An important point is that, in the presence of
perfectly conducting parallel plates, the three degrees of freedom do not yield
three discrete (non-penetrating) modes but two discrete modes and one continuum
(penetrating) mode. The massless sector reproduces Casimir's original result
and the Proca sector yields the corrections. The contribution from the Proca
continuum mode is obtained within the framework of Lifshitz theory for plane
parallel dielectrics whereas the discrete modes are calculated via 5D formulas
for the piston geometry. An interesting manifestation of the extra compact
dimension is that the Casimir force between perfectly conducting plates depends
on the thicknesses of the slabs.

dimensions bigger than three. These Cantor sets in $S^{3}$ are constructed by
using Bing or Whitehead links as stages in defining sequences. Ancel and
Starbird, and separately Wright characterized the number of Bing links needed
in such constructions so as to produce Cantor sets. However it was unknown
whether varying the number of Bing and Whitehead links in the construction
would produce non equivalent Cantor sets. Using a generalization of geometric
index, and a careful analysis of three dimensional intersection patterns, we
prove that Bing-Whitehead Cantor sets are equivalently embedded in $S^3$ if and

equation in mixed (first order) form, based on discrete exterior calculus
(DEC). Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth
manifolds and DEC is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as
triangle and tetrahedral meshes. DEC is a coordinate invariant discretization,
in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh.
We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language
of exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential
form and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework
provided by DEC for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on
forms. We also develop a discretization for spatially dependent Hodge star that
varies with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address
discontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete
non-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The
resulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type,
with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed
numerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include
patch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known
solution in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability
values, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We
also show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A
convergence experiment is also included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short
introduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is
included in this paper. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition
in terms of exterior calculus.

recomputed does not pay off since the failed nodes recover fairly quickly, and
the recomputed routing paths need to be discarded. Instead, we develop
algorithms and protocols for dealing with such transient single node failures
by suppressing the failure (instead of advertising it across the network), and
routing messages to the destination via alternate paths that do not use the
failed node. We compare our solution to that of Ref. [11] wherein the authors
have presented a ""Failure Insensitive Routing"" protocol as a proactive recovery
scheme for handling transient node failures. We show that our algorithms are
faster by an order of magnitude while our paths are equally good. We show via

redshift of z~4. In combination with the observed quasar luminosity function we
assess the implications of this clustering for the relationship between quasar
luminosity and dark matter halo mass. Our analysis allows for non-linearity and
finite scatter in the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass, as well
as a luminosity dependent quasar lifetime. The additional novel ingredient in
our modelling is the allowance for an excess in the observed bias over the
underlying halo bias owing to the merger driven nature of quasar activity. We
find that the observations of clustering and luminosity function can be
explained only if both of the following conditions hold: (i) The luminosity to
halo mass ratio increases with halo mass; (ii) The observed clustering
amplitude is in excess of that expected solely from halo bias. The latter
result is statistically significant at the 99% level. Taken together, the
observations provide compelling evidence for merger driven quasar activity,
with a black-hole growth that is limited by feedback. In difference from
previous analyses, we show that there could be scatter in the luminosity halo
mass relation of up to 1 dex, and that quasar clustering can not be used to
estimate the quasar lifetime.

this mass-limited sample, we show that the locus of the red sequence
color-stellar mass relation evolves as Del(u-r) ~ (-0.44+/-0.02) z_phot for
z_phot < ~1.2. For z_phot > ~1.3, however, we are no longer able to reliably
distinguish red and blue subpopulations from the observed color distribution;
we show that this would require much deeper near infrared data. At 1.5 < z_phot
<1.8, the comoving number density of M_* > 10^11 M_Sol galaxies is ~50% of the
local value, with a red fraction of ~33%. Making a parametric fit to the
observed evolution, we find n_tot(z) ~ (1+z_phot)^(-0.52+/-0.12(+/-0.20)). We
find stronger evolution in the red fraction: f_red(z) ~
(1+z_phot)^(-1.17+/-0.18(+/-0.21)). Through a series of sensitivity analyses,
we show that the most important sources of systematic error are: 1. systematic
differences in the analysis of the z~0 and z>>0 samples; 2. systematic effects
associated with details of the photometric redshift calculation; and 3.
uncertainties in the photometric calibration. With this in mind, we show that
our results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completely
independent analysis which does not require redshift information for individual
galaxies. Our results suggest that, at most, 1/5 of local red sequence galaxies
with M_* >10^11 M_Sol were already in place at z ~ 2.

Ginzburg-Landau functional, which favors a spatially nonuniform long-range
ordering with a spiral structure. In color superconductors, this new
parity-violating term is a tiny effect of weak-interaction physics. The
modified phase diagram is determined and the corresponding ground states for
all the phases constructed. At the end, we estimate the coefficient of the new
term in the free energy functional, and discuss its relevance for the
phenomenology of dense quark matter.

allowed great advances in this field, but the prime question of quantifying the
role of each population in the system remains unresolved. Furthermore, the use

the straightforward characterization of hierarchical population structure and
the detection of populations acting as hubs critical for relaying gene flow or

nonlocal effects pose a problem for macroscopic characterization. In order to
get around this problem, we study the flows of several dense emulsions in a
wide-gap Couette geometry. We couple macroscopic rheometric experiments and
local velocity measurements through MRI techniques. As concentration
heterogeneities can be expected, we designed a method to measure the local
droplet concentration in emulsions with a MRI device. In contrast to dense
suspensions of rigid particles where very fast migration occurs under shear, we
show that no migration takes place in dense emulsions even for strains as large
as 100 000 in our systems. As a result of the absence of migration and of
finite size effect, we are able to determine very precisely the local
rheological behavior of several dense emulsions. As the materials are
homogeneous, this behavior can also be inferred from purely macroscopic
measurements. We thus suggest that properly analyzed purely macroscopic
measurements in a wide-gap Couette geometry can be used as a tool to study the
local constitutive laws of dense emulsions. All behaviors are basically
consistent with Herschel-Bulkley laws of index 0.5, but discrepancies exist at
the approach of the yield stress due to slow shear flows below the apparent
yield stress in the case of a strongly adhesive emulsion. The existence of a
constitutive law accounting for all flows contrasts with previous results
obtained within a microchannel by Goyon et al. (2008): the use of a wide-gap

consistent with the variable range hopping mechanism at low temperature and

follow a power law behavior at a limited temperature and frequency region where
Anderson-localization plays a significant role in the transport mechanism for
all the compositions. At low temperatures large dc resistivities and dielectric
relaxation behavior for all the compositions are consistent with the polaronic
nature of the charge carriers. Scaling of the modulus spectra shows that the
charge transport dynamics is independent of temperature for a particular

different charge carrier concentrations and structural properties.

considering implications for the dynamics of the galactic disks. An important
diagnostic is the Toomre Q stability parameter which controls the stability of
a galactic disk against local Jeans collapse. I also show how the density wave
theory of galactic spiral arms can be employed to constrain the mass of a
galactic disk. Applying both diagnostics to the example of NGC 2985 and
discussing also the implied mass-to-light ratio I demonstrate that the inner
parts of the galaxy, where the optical disk resides, are dominated by baryons.
When I apply this method to the disks of low surface brightness galaxies, I
find unexpectedly high mass-to light ratios. These could be explained by
population synthesis models which assume a bottom heavy initial mass function
similar to the recently proposed `integrated galactic initial mass function'.

for primordial antinuclei (anti-helium), and testing cosmic-ray propagation
models through precise measurements of the antiparticle energy spectrum and
precision studies of light nuclei and their isotopes. We review the status of
the apparatus and present preliminary results concerning antiparticle

MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite in continuous runs of
34, 17, and 34 days in 2004, 2005, and 2007, was found to pulsate in 11
frequencies in the delta Scuti range with amplitudes from 1.7 down to 0.09
mmag. The photometry also showed variations with a period of about four days.
To investigate the nature of the longer period, 45 days of time-resolved
spectroscopy was obtained at the Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg in
2004. The radial velocity measurements indicate that HD 61199 is a triple
system. A delta Scuti pulsator with a rich eigenspectrum in a multiple system
is promising for asteroseismology. Our objectives were to identify which of the
stars in the system is the delta Scuti variable and to obtain the orbital
elements of the system and the fundamental parameters of the individual
components, which are constrained by the pulsation frequencies of the delta
Scuti star. Classical Fourier techniques and least-squares multi-sinusoidal
fits were applied to the MOST photometry to identify the pulsation frequencies.
The groundbased spectroscopy was analysed with least-squares-deconvolution
(LSD) techniques, and the orbital elements derived with the KOREL and ORBITX
routines. Asteroseismic models were also generated. The photometric and
spectroscopic data are compatible with a triple system consisting of a close
binary with an orbital period of 3.57 days and a delta Scuti companion (HD
61199,A) as the most luminous component. The delta Scuti star is a rapid
rotator with about vsin i = 130 km/s and an upper mass limit of about 2.1 Msun.
For the close binary components, we find they are of nearly equal mass, with
lower mass limits of about 0.7 Msun.

by introducing the concept of quantum channel describing the system changes
between preparations and measurements. At the very end we review the elementary

with an accurate numerical wave model, thanks to a novel parameterization of

and significant wave height, generally increasing quadratically with the wind
speed. Focusing on a site located 100 km from the mainland, the estimated
contribution of Uss to the radar measurement has a magnitude of 0.6 to 1.3% of
the wind speed, in the wind direction, a fraction that increases with wind
speed. The difference U_E of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions is found to be

linear symmetries. For chiral symmetry the well-known Ginsparg-Wilson relation

the lattice and guides the construction of invariant lattice actions. We apply
this approach to lattice supersymmetry. There, an additional constraint has to
be satisfied which originates in the derivative operator in the symmetry
transformations. As a consequence the non-local SLAC derivative operator
appears in the lattice transformation. Despite this non-local form we show how
local solutions for quadratic actions can be found. For interacting theories
the relation in general leads to a non-polynomial action that can be reduced to
a finite polynomial order only under certain conditions.

Hence, the moduli $G'$ and $G""$ in the linear viscoelastic regime as well as
the flow curves (shear stress $\sigma(\dot{\gamma})$ as the function of the
shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$) could be measured in the fluid region up to the

a range of shear rates of 8 orders of magnitude while $G'$ and $G""$ could be

the two reddest MIR bands are excluded. While our methods are designed to find
type 1 (unobscured) quasars, as many as 1200 of the objects are type 2
(obscured) quasar candidates. Coupling deep optical imaging data with deep
mid-IR data could enable selection of quasars in significant numbers past the
peak of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) to at least z~4. Such a sample
would constrain the shape of the QLF and enable quasar clustering studies over
the largest range of redshift and luminosity to date, yielding significant
gains in our understanding of quasars and the evolution of galaxies.

170 kpc and have HI masses ranging from 0.48 to 1.7 x 10^8 Msun. The overall HI

resolved clouds show no evidence of symmetry in the gas distribution or of any

objects, embedded in their own dark matter halo is thought to be unlikely.

traveling at high speed through the intracluster medium are considered. The
most likely among those is thought to be one where the clouds were separated
from NGC 4445 at a time >0.5 Gyr ago. The orbital velocity of the clouds and

young star clusters and dense HI regions. We find no strong differences in the
MIR colors of star-forming regions in the spiral galaxy NGC6872 as a function
of position relative to the tidally interacting companion galaxy IC4970. We
find 11 very luminous X-ray sources (>~ (0.5 - 5) x 10^{39} ergs/s) clustered

tidal features, young star clusters form at the boundaries of diffuse X-ray

nucleus of NGC6872 is a weak X-ray point source (0.5-8 keV luminosity of 8.5 x

PAH emission from recent star formation or nuclear activity. However, a 4 kpc

transport of interstellar matter into NGC6872's nuclear region. Nonstellar
emission, consistent with PAH emission, is also found in the central region of
elliptical galaxy NGC6877, companion to dominant Pavo group elliptical NGC6876.
However, in the central region of NGC6876, the dust emission is more likely due
to silicate emission from old AGB stars.

(GLF) and the spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB), which
is consistent with the observed distributions of EGRET blazars. The unified
sequence of blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) is taken into account to
make a non-trivial prediction for the EGRB spectrum and more realistic
comparison with the data than previous studies. We then try to explain the EGRB
data by the two AGN populations: one is blazars, and the other is non-blazar
AGNs that are responsible for the EGRB in the MeV band. We find that ~80% of
the EGRB photon flux at > 100 MeV can be explained by the sum of the two
populations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. The predicted
EGRB spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from X-ray
to GeV, within the systematic uncertainties in the EGRB determination by EGRET.
These results indicate that AGNs including blazars are the primary source of
EGRB. Blazars are dominant in EGRB at higher energy bands of >100 MeV, while
non-blazar AGNs dominate at <100 MeV. Almost all of the EGRB flux from blazars
will be resolved into discrete sources by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
while that from non-blazar AGNs will largely remain unresolved. Therefore,
comparison between the integrated source counts and diffuse EGRB flux as a
function of photon energy will give a simple and clear test of our model.
Various quantitative predictions for Fermi observations are also made.
Especially, our model predicts 600-1200 blazars in all sky down to 2e-9
photons/cm^-2/s (>100 MeV), which is considerably smaller than most of previous
studies.

analysis of recursive simple stochastic games to a concurrent setting where the
two players choose moves simultaneously and independently at each state. For
multi-exit games, our earlier work already showed undecidability for basic
questions like termination, thus we focus on the important case of single-exit
RCSGs (1-RCSGs).
  We first characterize the value of a 1-RCSG termination game as the least
fixed point solution of a system of nonlinear minimax functional equations, and
use it to show PSPACE decidability for the quantitative termination problem. We
then give a strategy improvement technique, which we use to show that player 1
(maximizer) has \epsilon-optimal randomized Stackless & Memoryless (r-SM)
strategies for all \epsilon > 0, while player 2 (minimizer) has optimal r-SM
strategies. Thus, such games are r-SM-determined. These results mirror and
generalize in a strong sense the randomized memoryless determinacy results for
finite stochastic games, and extend the classic Hoffman-Karp strategy
improvement approach from the finite to an infinite state setting. The proofs
in our infinite-state setting are very different however, relying on subtle
analytic properties of certain power series that arise from studying 1-RCSGs.
  We show that our upper bounds, even for qualitative (probability 1)
termination, can not be improved, even to NP, without a major breakthrough, by
giving two reductions: first a P-time reduction from the long-standing
square-root sum problem to the quantitative termination decision problem for
finite concurrent stochastic games, and then a P-time reduction from the latter
problem to the qualitative termination problem for 1-RCSGs.

H^{-1/2}(div)-regularity (r > 0) and for which we show quasi-stability with
respect to polynomial degrees.

for over 30yrs and so observations span nearly three 11yr solar activity
cycles. This allows us to address important questions concerning the solar
cycle and its effect on solar oscillations, such as: how consistent is the
acoustic behaviour from one cycle to the next? We have used the p-mode
frequencies observed in BiSON data from one solar activity cycle (cycle 22) to
predict the mode frequencies that were observed in the next activity cycle
(cycle 23). Some bias in the predicted frequencies was observed when short 108d
time series were used to make the predictions. We also found that the accuracy
of the predictions was dependent on which activity proxy was used to make the
predictions and on the length of the relevant time series.

at next-to-leading order in 1/N(C), we have analyzed the two-body form factors
which include resonances as a final state . The short-distance constraints have
been studied. One of the main motivations is the estimation of the chiral
low-energy constants at subleading order, that is, keeping full control of the
renormalization scale dependence. As an application we show the resonance
estimation of some coupling, L(10)(mu_0)=(-4.4 \pm 0.9)10^{-3} and
C(87)(mu_0)=(3.1 \pm 1.1)10^{-5}.
