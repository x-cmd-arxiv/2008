weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) scenario in which the cross section
(times relative velocity v) for pair annihilation is enhanced by a factor 1/v.
Since v~10^{-3} in the Galactic halo, this may boost the annihilation rate into
photons and/or electron-positron pairs enough to explain several puzzling
Galactic radiation signals. Here we show that if the annihilation cross section
scales as 1/v, then there is a burst of WIMP annihilation in the first
dark-matter halos that form at redshifts z ~ 100-200. If the annihilation is to
gamma rays in the energy range 100 keV - 300 GeV, or to electron-positron pairs
in the energy range GeV - 2 TeV, then there remains a contribution to the
diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background today. Upper limits to this
background provide constraints to the annihilation cross section. If the photon
or electron-positron energies fall outside these energy ranges, then the
radiation is absorbed by the intergalactic medium (IGM) and thus ionizes and
heats the IGM. In this case, cosmic microwave background constraints to the
ionization history also put limits on the annihilation cross section.

black hole masses from single-epoch spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by
utilizing the many epochs available for NGC 5548 and PG1229+204 from
reverberation mapping databases. In particular, we examine systematics due to
AGN variability, contamination due to constant spectral components (i.e.,
narrow lines and host galaxy flux), data quality (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio,
S/N), and blending of spectral features by comparing the precision and accuracy
of single-epoch mass measurements to those of recent reverberation mapping
studies. We calculate masses by characterizing the broad Hbeta emission line by
both the full width at half maximum and the line dispersion and demonstrate the
importance of removing narrow emission-line components and host starlight. We
find that the reliability of line width measurements rapidly decreases for S/N
lower than ~10 to 20 (per pixel) and that fitting the line profiles instead of
direct measurement of the data does not mitigate this problem but can, in fact,
introduce systematic errors. We also conclude that a full spectral
decomposition to deblend the AGN and galaxy spectral features is unnecessary
except to judge the contribution of the host galaxy to the luminosity and to
deblend any emission lines that may inhibit accurate line width measurements.
Finally, we present an error budget which summarizes the minimum observable
uncertainties as well as the amount of additional scatter and/or systematic
offset that can be expected from the individual sources of error investigated.
In particular, we find that the minimum observable uncertainty in single-epoch
mass estimates due to variability is <~ 0.1 dex for high S/N (>~ 20 per pixel)
spectra.

have masses below the deuterium burning limit (0.012 Msun). We use a Monte
Carlo approach to model the observed luminosity function with a variety of
cluster age and mass distributions. The lowest chi^2 values are produced by an
age distribution centred at 1 Myr, with a mass function that declines at
sub-stellar masses according to an M^alpha power law in the range alpha=0.3 to
0.6. We find that truncating the mass function at 0.012 Msun produces
luminosity functions that are starved of the faintest magnitudes, even when
using bimodal age populations that contain 10 Myr old sources. The results of

dynamo modes in curved Riemannian heliotron are shown to be excited on a plasma
flow yielding a growth rate of ${\gamma}=0.318$ for an aspect ratio of
${r_{0}}/L\approx{0.16}$. It is interesting to note that the first growth rate
was obtained in the Wang et al slow dynamo, where the magnetic Reynolds number
of $Re_{m}=210$, while in the second one considered in this paper one uses the
limit of $Re_{m}\to{\infty}$. These growth rates ${\gamma}$ are computed by
applying the fast dynamo limit $lim_{{\eta}\to{0}}{\gamma}(\eta)>0$. This limit
is used in the self-induced equation, without the need to solve these equations
to investigate the fast dynamo action of the flow. In this sense the fast
dynamo seems to be excited by the elongation of the plasma device as suggested
by Wang group. The Frenet curvature of the tube is given by
${\kappa}_{0}\approx{0.5 m^{-1}}$. It is suggested that the small Perm torus
could be twisted [Dobler et al, Phys Rev E (2003)] in order to enhance even
more the fast dynamo effect. By considering the stability of the plasma torus
one obtains a value for the fast dynamo growth rate as high as ${\gamma}=1.712$

provide an approximate characterization of the rate region. We show that the
rate region can be sandwiched between two polytopes, between which the gap can
be upper bounded by constants dependent on the number of descriptions, but
independent of the exact distortion constraints. Underlying this result is an
exact characterization of the lossless multi-level diversity source coding
problem: a lossless counterpart of the MD problem. This connection provides a
polytopic template for the inner and outer bounds to the rate region. In order
to establish the outer bound, we generalize Ozarow's technique to introduce a
strategic expansion of the original probability space by more than one random
variables. For the symmetric rate case with any number of descriptions, we show
that the gap between the upper bound and the lower bound for the individual
description rate is no larger than 0.92 bit. The results developed in this work
also suggest the ""separation"" approach of combining successive refinement
quantization and lossless multi-level diversity coding is a competitive one,
since it is only a constant away from the optimum. The results are further
extended to general sources under the mean squared error distortion measure,
where a similar but looser bound on the gap holds.

flexible at x<22.5%, intermediate phase (IP) in the 22.5%<x<29.5% range, and
stressed-rigid at x>29.5%. Raman scattering supported by first principles
cluster calculations reveal existence of both pyramidal (PYR, As(S1/2)3) and
quasi-tetrahedral(QT, S=As(S1/2)3) local structures. The QT unit concentrations
show a global maximum in the IP, while the concentration of PYR units becomes
comparable to those of QT units in the phase, suggesting that both these local
structures contribute to the width of the IP. The IP centroid in the sulfides
is significantly shifted to lower As content x than in corresponding selenides,
a feature identified with excess chalcogen partially segregating from the
backbone in the sulfides, but forming part of the backbone in selenides. These
ideas are corroborated by the proportionately larger free volumes of sulfides
than selenides, and the absence of chemical bond strength scaling of Tgs
between As-sulfides and As-selenides. Low-frequency Raman modes increase in
scattering strength linearly as As content x of glasses decreases from x = 20%
to 8%, with a slope that is close to the floppy mode fraction in flexible
glasses predicted by rigidity theory. These results show that floppy modes
contribute to the excess vibrations observed at low frequency. In the

signature of this process is a $\pi^0$ which is highly forward-going. It is
useful to study coherent production using antineutrinos rather than neutrinos

antineutrino running. The measurement of NC coherent $\pi^0$ production in the

formation are explicitly linked up to z~1. We identify 152 galaxies that harbor
AGN, based on XMM observations of 7543 galaxies (i<22.5). Star formation rates
(SFRs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the
[OII]3727 emission-line, corrected for an AGN contribution. We find that the
majority of AGN hosts have significant levels of star formation with a
distribution spanning ~1-100 Msun yr^-1. The close association between AGN
activity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the AGN
fraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame
color (U-V) and spectral index Dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selection
alleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when using
luminosity-limited samples. We also find that the SFRs of AGN hosts evolve with
cosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population and
explains the low SFRs in AGNs (z<0.3) from the SDSS. We conclude that the
conditions most conducive for AGN activity are a massive host galaxy and a
large reservoir of gas. Furthermore, a direct correlation between mass
accretion rate onto SMBHs and SFR is shown to be weak although the average
ratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for a
co-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. Our
findings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an AGN lifetime substantially
shorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regarding
fueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [Abridged].

have an almost universal behaviour in numerical simulations, however, the
physical reason for this behaviour remains unclear. It has previously been
shown that if the pseudo phase-space density, rho/sigma_d^epsilon, is a
beautifully simple power-law in radius, with the ""golden values"" epsilon=3 and
d=r (i.e., the phase-space density is only dependent on the radial component of
the velocity dispersion), then one can analytically derive the radial variation
of the mass profile, dispersion profile etc. That would imply, if correct, that
we just have to explain why rho/sigma^3_r ~r^{-alpha}, and then we would
understand everything about equilibrated DM structures. Here we use a set of
simulated galaxies and clusters of galaxies to demonstrate that there are no
such golden values, but that each structure instead has its own set of values.
Considering the same structure at different redshifts shows no evolution of the
phase-space parameters towards fixed points. There is also no clear connection
between the halo virialized mass and these parameters. This implies that we
still do not understand the origin of the profiles of dark matter structures.

strengths and high cosmic ray fluxes considered at a range of metallicities,
are likely to have enhanced low-mass star formation unless the magnetic
pressure is sufficient to halt collapse. Our results indicate that this is only
likely to be the case for high-redshift galaxies approaching solar
metallicities. Unless this is true for all high-redshift sources, this study
finds little evidence for a high-mass biased IMF at high redshifts.

undergoing slow accelerations. The accelerations are likely due to one or more
gas giant planets or brown dwarfs orbiting with period longer than the total
time span of observations. The stellar acceleration is proportional to the mass
of the companion divided by the square of its radius from the star. In this
paper we predict the distribution of accelerations using a Monte Carlo method
and assuming a semi-major axis and mass distribution for the companions. Radial
velocity surveys find that ~20 and 10% of stars surveyed exhibit accelerations
above ~10 and 25 m s^-1 yr^-1, respectively. We find that an extrapolation of
the size and period distribution found by radial velocity surveys within ~5 AU
or companion imaging surveys predicts too few systems with detectable
accelerations. The fractions of stars with accelerations above these values can
be matched if every star hosts a gas giant planet or brown dwarf with
semi-major axes between 4 and 20 AU or if a significant fraction (~70%) of
stars host 3 or more massive planets in this range. If brown dwarfs are not
discovered in imaging surveys then we would infer that there is a large

new powerful observing window on the Universe. In fact, the exploration of the
X-ray sky during the 70s-90s has established X-ray astronomy as a fundamental
field of astrophysics. Today, the emission from astrophysical sources is by
large best known at energies below 10 keV. The main reason for this situation
is purely technical since grazing incidence reflection has so far been limited
to the soft X-ray band. Above 10 keV all the observations have been obtained
with collimated detectors or coded mask instruments. To make a leap step
forward in X-ray astronomy above 10 keV it is necessary to extend the principle
of focusing X ray optics to higher energies, up to 80 keV and beyond. To this
end, ASI and CNES are presently studying the implementation of a X-ray mission
called Simbol-X.
  Taking advantage of emerging technology in mirror manufacturing and
spacecraft formation flying, Simbol-X will push grazing incidence imaging up to
80 keV and beyond, providing a strong improvement both in sensitivity and
angular resolution compared to all instruments that have operated so far above
10 keV. This technological breakthrough will open a new high-energy window in
astrophysics and cosmology. Here we will address the problematic of the
development for such a distributed and deformable instrument. We will focus on
the main performances of the telescope, like angular resolution, sensitivity
and source localization. We will also describe the specificity of the

applied to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric wrong sign ($-x^{4}$) quartic
potential. The importance of this work lies in the possibility of its extension
to the more important $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum field theory while the
other approaches which use complex contours are not willing to be applicable.
We calculated the effective potential of the massless $-x^{4}$ theory as well
as the full spectrum of the theory. Although the calculations are carried out
up to first order in the coupling, the predicted spectrum is very close to the
exact one taken from other works. The most important result of this work is
that the effective potential obtained, which is equivalent to the Gaussian
effective potential, is bounded from below while the classical potential is
bounded from above. This explains the stability of the vacuum of the theory.
The obtained quasi-particle Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian but
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and we showed that the calculation of the metric
operator can go perturbatively. In fact, the calculation of the metric operator
can be done even for higher dimensions (quantum field theory) which, up till
now, can not be calculated in the other approaches either perturbatively or in
a closed form due to the possible appearance of field radicals. Moreover, we
argued that the effective theory is perturbative for the whole range of the

galaxy catalog from the images and the Voronoi Tessellation cluster finding
algorithm that we use to identify the galaxy clusters on those catalogs. To
test our pipeline with data similar in quality to what will be gathered by
future wide field surveys, we process images from the Deep fields obtained as
part of the LEGACY Survey (four fields of one square degree each, in five
bands, with depth up to r'=25). We test our cluster finder by determining the
completeness and purity of the finder when applied to mock galaxy catalogs made
for the Dark Energy Survey cluster finder comparison project by Risa Wechsler

constrained by the gravitational coefficients J_2, J_4, and J_6 for different
assumed rotation rates of the planet. The empirical pressure-density profile is
interpreted in terms of a hydrogen and helium physical equation of state to
deduce the hydrogen to helium ratio in Saturn and to constrain the depth
dependence of helium and heavy element abundances. The planet's internal
structure (pressure vs. density) and composition are found to be insensitive to
the assumed rotation rate for periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s. We
find that helium is depleted in the upper envelope, while in the high pressure
region (P >~ 1 Mbar) either the helium abundance or the concentration of
heavier elements is significantly enhanced. Taking the ratio of hydrogen to
helium in Saturn to be solar, we find that the maximum mass of heavy elements
in Saturn's interior ranges from ~ 6 to 20 M_Earth. The empirical models of
Saturn's interior yield a moment of inertia factor varying from 0.22271 to
0.22599 for rotation periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s, respectively.
A long-term precession rate of about 0.754"" yr^{-1} is found to be consistent
with the derived moment of inertia values and assumed rotation rates over the
entire range of investigated rotation rates. This suggests that the long-term
precession period of Saturn is somewhat shorter than the generally assumed
value of 1.77 x 10^6 years inferred from modeling and observations.

statistics by a factor of four over the sample used by Ellison (2006). We
investigate various techniques to define the velocity spread (Delta v) of the
MgII line to determine an optimal D-index for the identification of DLAs. The
success rate of DLA identification is 50 -- 55%, depending on the velocity
limits used, improving by a few percent when the column density of FeII is
included in the D-index calculation. We recommend the set of parameters that is
judged to be most robust, have a combination of high DLA identification rate
(57%) and low DLA miss rate (6%) and most cleanly separate the DLAs and
sub-DLAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability 0.5%). These statistics demonstrate
that the D-index is the most efficient technique for selecting low redshift DLA
candidates: 65% more efficient than selecting DLAs based on the equivalent
widths of MgII and FeII alone. We also investigate the effect of resolution on
determining the N(HI) of sub-DLAs. We convolve echelle spectra of sub-DLA Lya
profiles with Gaussians typical of the spectral resolution of instruments on
the Hubble Space Telescope and compare the best fit N(HI) values at both

over-estimated by ~ 0.1 dex in the moderate resolution spectra compared to the
best fits to the original echelle spectra. This offset is due to blending of
nearby Lya clouds that are included in the damping wing fit at low resolution.

interpret this visibility offset of a few percent as a near-infrared excess
arising from dust grains which, due to the instrumental field of view, must be
located within several AU of the central star. For beta Leo, the near-infrared
excess producing grains are spatially distinct from the dust which produces the
previously known mid-infrared excess. For zeta Lep, the near-infrared excess
may be spatially associated with the mid-infrared excess producing material. We
present simple geometric models which are consistent with the near and

the upper troposphere, which is populated with a fine (~0.5 micrometer) haze.
Two haze sources have been proposed: lofting of fine cloud particles into the
stable upper troposphere, and condensation of hydrazine produced via ammonia
photochemistry. The upper tropospheric haze is enhanced over Jupiter's
equatorial region.
  Dramatic changes in the underlying cloud cover--part of the 2006/2007 ""global

now evident in the 2008 MAD images. Haze reflectivity peaked at 5 degrees N in

H2 and fragmented prior to the epoch of cosmic reionization. We count 4,500
such progenitors: if these were able to convert a fraction of their gas content
into very metal-poor stars with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), they
would be shining today with a visual magnitude M_V=6.7 per solar mass in stars.
Assuming a universal baryon fraction, we show that mean star formation
efficiencies as low as 0.1% in progenitors below 1e8 Msun would overproduce the
abundance of the faint Galatic dwarf spheroidals observed by the Sloan Digital

lacking stars below 0.9 Msun, or was intrinsically very inefficient in small

strong magnetic field is significantly reduced by applied electric field, an
effect which is studied in a broad range of magnetic fields and temperatures in
GaAs quantum wells with high electron density. The data are found to be in good
agreement with theory, considering the strong nonlinearity of the resistivity
as result of non-uniform spectral diffusion of the 2D electrons. Inelastic
processes limit the diffusion. Comparison with the theory yields the inelastic
scattering time of the two dimensional electrons. In the temperature range
T=2-10(K) for overlapping Landau levels, the inelastic scattering rate is found
to be proportional to T^2, indicating a dominant contribution of the
electron-electron scattering to the inelastic relaxation. In a strong magnetic
field, the nonlinear resistivity demonstrates scaling behavior, indicating a
specific regime of electron heating of well-separated Landau levels. In this
regime the inelastic scattering rate is found to be proportional to T^3,

by noise, and the communication among the nodes is subject to packet losses.
Nodes exchange local estimates and measurements with neighboring nodes. Each
node of the network locally computes adaptive weights that minimize the
estimation error variance. Decentralized conditions on the weights, needed for
the convergence of the estimation error throughout the overall network, are
presented. A Lipschitz optimization problem is posed to guarantee stability and
the minimization of the variance. An efficient strategy to distribute the
computation of the optimal solution is investigated. A theoretical performance
analysis of the distributed algorithm is carried out both in the presence of
perfect and lossy links. Numerical simulations illustrate performance for
various network topologies and packet loss probabilities.

theory of the almost Poisson structure is investigated based on a decomposition
of the bracket into a sum of a Poisson one and an almost Poisson one. The
corresponding relation between Poisson structure and symplectic structure is
proved, making use of Jacobiizer and symplecticizer. Based on analysis of
pseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of Chaplygin nonholonomic

decomposed into a sum of a canonical Poisson one and an almost Poisson one.
Similarly, an almost Poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum of
canonical one and an almost Lie-Poisson one, is also constructed on an affine
space with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the free
motion of some non-self-adjoint systems. The decomposition of the almost

earth has been a goal of neutrino researchers for about half a century. It was
accomplished by the KamLAND Collaboration in 2005, and opens the way towards
studies of the Earth's radioactive content, with very important implications
for geology. New detectors are operating (KamLAND and Borexino), building
(SNO+) and being proposed (Hanohano, LENA, Earth and others) that will go
beyond the initial observation and allow interesting geophysical and
geochemical research, in a means not otherwise possible. Herein we describe the
approaches being taken (large liquid scintillation instruments), the
experimental and technical challenges (optical detectors, directionality), and
prospects for growth of this field. There is related spinoff in particle
physics (neutrino oscillations and hierarchy determination), astrophysics
(solar neutrinos, supernovae, exotica), and in the practical matter of remote
monitoring of nuclear reactors.

with this problem, CDF has pushed the offline calorimeter algorithm
reconstruction resolution up to Level 2 and, when possible, even up to Level 1,
increasing efficiency and, at the same time, keeping under control the rates.
  The CDF Run II Level 2 calorimeter trigger is implemented in hardware and is
based on a simple algorithm that was used in Run I. This system has worked well
for Run II at low luminosity. As the Tevatron instantaneous luminosity
increases, the limitation due to this simple algorithm starts to become clear:
some of the most important jet and MET (Missing ET) related triggers have large
growth terms in cross section at higher luminosity. In this paper, we present
an upgrade of the Level 2 Calorimeter system which makes the calorimeter
trigger tower information available directly to a CPU allowing more
sophisticated algorithms to be implemented in software. Both Level 2 jets and
MET can be made nearly equivalent to offline quality, thus significantly
improving the performance and flexibility of the jet and MET related triggers.
However in order to fully take advantage of the new L2 triggering capabilities
having at Level 1 the same L2 MET resolution is necessary. The new Level-1 MET
resolution is calculated by dedicated hardware. This paper describes the
design, the hardware and software implementation and the performance of the
upgraded calorimeter trigger system both at Level 2 and Level 1.

The shadow is shifted to the west of the moon's apparent position as an effect
of the geomagnetic field, although the extent of this displacement depends on
the primary energy positively charged cosmic rays. This finding enables us to
estimate the systematic error in determining the primary energy from its shower
size. This error is estimated to be less than $\pm$12% in our experiment. This
energy scale estimation is the first attempt among cosmic-ray experiments at
ground level. The systematic pointing error is also estimated to be smaller
than $0\fdg011$. The deficit rate and position of the moon's shadow are shown
to be very stable within a statistical error of $\pm$6% year by year. This
guarantees the long-term stability of point-like source observation with the
Tibet-III array. These systematic errors are adequately taken into account in
our study of the Crab Nebula.

we demonstrate that the outward curvature radiation dominates in the spectrum

non-locality is along a light-front, in contrast to the non-locality along the
light-cone for collinear correlators, integrated over transverse momenta. The
TMD correlators require a careful treatment to assure color gauge invariance,
leading to nontrivial gauge links connecting the parton fields. These give rise

lambda_Edd <~ 0.1, kappa_2-10keV ~ 20 - 70 for 0.1 <~ lambda_Edd <~ 0.2 and
kappa_2-10keV ~ 70 - 150 for lambda_Edd >~ 0.2, but part of this increase could
be attributed to spectral complexity preventing accurate recovery of the
intrinsic luminosity in some sources. Long-term optical-UV variability
contributes a second-order, but significant change to the total bolometric
luminosity when comparing multiple observations for individual objects.We also
consider the effect of a recently proposed correction for radiation pressure
when determining black hole masses with reverberation mapping, and find that
the revised mass estimates do not significantly alter the range of bolometric
corrections seen but may yield a narrower distribution of Eddington ratios.

spaces are characterized by the fact that they admit a pseudocontinuation a.e.
on $\T$. More can be said if the spectrum of the associated inner function has
holes on $\T$. Then the functions of the invariant subspaces even extend
analytically through these holes. We will discuss the situation in weighted
backward shift invariant subspaces. The results on analytic continuation will
be applied to consider some embeddings of weighted invariant subspaces into
their unweighted companions. Such weighted versions of invariant subspaces

Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model, is replaced by Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potentials.
Similarly, a soft potential of height comparable to thermal energy is used for
the polymer-polymer interaction, rather than treating polymers as ideal gas
particles. It is shown by grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations that this
model leads to a coexistence curve that almost coincides with that of the AO
model and the Ising critical behavior of static quantities is reproduced. Then
the main advantage of the model is exploited - its suitability for Molecular
Dynamics simulations - to study the dynamics of mean square displacements of
the particles, transport coefficients such as the self-diffusion and
interdiffusion coefficients, and dynamic structure factors. While the
self-diffusion of polymers increases slightly when the critical point is
approached, the self-diffusion of colloids decreases and at criticality the
colloid self-diffusion coefficient is about a factor of 10 smaller than that of
the polymers. Critical slowing down of interdiffusion is observed, which is
qualitatively similar to symmetric binary Lennard-Jones mixtures, for which no
dynamic asymmetry of self-diffusion coefficients occurs.

conformal invariance is realized, we show that the effective Lagrangian must
contain an unnoticed invariant combination of higher spatial gradients of the

non-local effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches,
this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It
therefore becomes possible to treat the irreducible vertices of an effective

efficient interpolation between band-like weak-coupling and atomic limits. The
method is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model. The

photo-cathode rf linac) injection in a laser wakefield for different
configurations. In this paper we investigate a new way of external injection
where the electron bunch is injected at a small angle into the wakefield. This
way one can avoid the ponderomotive scattering as well as the vacuum-plasma
transition region, which tend to destroy the injected bunch. In our
simulations, the effect of the laser pulse dynamics is also taken into account.
It is shown that injection at an angle can provide compressed and accelerated
electron bunches with less than 2% energy spread. Another advantage of this
scheme is that it has less stringent requirements in terms of the size of the
injected bunch and there is the potential to trap more charge.

probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms.
In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed
by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the
state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of value
updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is
identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can
be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen
action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state
according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of
the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is
parallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL
such as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and
exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude
and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the
performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given
and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm
for some complex problems. The present work is also an effective exploration on
the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.

Despite this fact the contribution of the reaction in changes of the species

coordinates (J2000) ra=07h49m, dec=04d30m is presented. The HI object was
detected at 21cm using the 300-m NAIC Arecibo telescope. Subsequent follow-up
high-resolution observations with the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) telescope at
L-Band revealed more details about its morphology. The most intriguing aspect
of the object is the clear velocity gradient of 1 km/s, which is present in the
data, an indication of either rotation or expansion. The gas appears to be
cold, and its morphology is somewhat elliptical with clumpy substructure.
Assuming disk rotation, the dynamical mass could be determined as a function of
distance.Depending on the exact nature of the velocity gradient in the HI
cloud, we can reach some preliminary conclusions about the nature of the
object. Expansion would imply association with a circumstellar envelope of an
evolved AGB star, while in the case of rotation, a comparison between the
visible and the dynamical mass can lead to some preliminary conclusions. A
common feature of those conclusions is the presence of a gravitational
potential well, which is required to account for the rotation of the trapped HI
gas. This potential well could be associated with a dark galaxy or some other
exotic object.
