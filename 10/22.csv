to detect outflows, spectral asymmetries in 13CO are used to determine infall

  Through comparison with Spitzer observations of protostellar sources in
Ophiuchus, we discuss the usefulness of CO and its isotopologues as the sole
indicators of the evolutionary state of each core. This study is an important
pilot project for the JCMT Legacy Survey of the Gould Belt (GBS) and the

capacity with universal frequency reuse. To quantify near-far effects with
universal frequency reuse, this paper derives a fundamental relation providing
the largest feasible cellular Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR),
given any set of feasible femtocell SINRs. We provide a link budget analysis
which enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. A
distributed utility-based SINR adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order to
alleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells.
The Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. Each
femtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a SINR based reward
less an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). Numerical results show
greater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell SINRs relative to FM. In the
event that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining its
SINR target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of the
strongest femtocell interferers. The algorithm ensures that a cellular user
achieves its SINR target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site, and requires a
worst case SINR reduction of only 16% at femtocells. These results motivate
design of power control schemes requiring minimal network overhead in two-tier
networks with shared spectrum.

of surface transport and surface-induced relaxation of bulk carriers in the

channel, where two nodes want to exchange data with each other using multiple
relays. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal achievable
rate region, when each relay employs an amplify and forward (AF) strategy.
  The iterative algorithm solves a power minimization problem at every step,
subject to minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraints, which is
non-convex, however, for which the Karush Kuhn Tuker conditions are sufficient
for optimality. The optimal AF strategy assumes global channel state
information (CSI) at each relay. To simplify the CSI requirements, a simple
amplify and forward strategy, called dual channel matching, is also proposed,
that requires only local channel state information, and whose achievable rate
region is close to that of the optimal AF strategy. In the asymptotic regime of
large number of relays, we show that the achievable rate region of the dual
channel matching and an upper bound differ by only a constant term and
establish the capacity scaling law of the two-way relay channel. Relay
strategies achieving optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff are also
considered with a single relay node. A compress and forward strategy is shown
to be optimal for achieving diversity multiplexing tradeoff for the full-duplex
case, in general, and for the half-duplex case in some cases.

Using an optimized Hbeta index in conjunction with HST/WFPC2 color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs), we show that Galactic globular clusters exhibit a large
scatter in their apparent ""spectroscopic"" ages, which does not correspond to
that in their CMD-derived ages. We find for the first time that the specific
frequency of BSSs, defined within the same aperture as the integrated spectra,
shows a clear correspondence with Hbeta in the sense that, at fixed
metallicity, higher BSS ratios lead to younger ""apparent"" spectroscopic ages.
Thus, the specific frequency of BSSs in globular clusters sets a fundamental
limit on the accuracy for which spectroscopic ages can be determined for
globular clusters, and maybe for other stellar systems like galaxies. The
observational implications of this result are discussed.

of basic importance in optimization. It is well known since Minty, Rockafellar,
and Bertsekas-Eckstein that in Hilbert space, monotone operators can be
understood and analyzed from the alternative viewpoint of firmly nonexpansive
mappings, which were found to be precisely the resolvents of monotone
operators. For example, the proximal mappings in the sense of Moreau are
precisely the resolvents of subdifferential operators. More general notions of
""resolvent"", ""proximal mapping"" and ""firmly nonexpansive"" have been studied.
One important class, popularized chiefly by Alber and by Kohsaka and Takahashi,
is based on the normalized duality mapping. Furthermore, Censor and Lent
pioneered the use of the gradient of a well behaved convex functions in a
Bregman-distance based framework. It is known that resolvents are firmly
nonexpansive, but the converse has been an open problem for the latter
framework.
  In this note, we build on the very recent characterization of maximal
monotonicity due to Martinez-Legaz to provide a framework for studying
resolvents in which firmly nonexpansive mappings are always resolvents. This
framework includes classical resolvents, resolvents based on the normalized
duality mapping, resolvents based on Bregman distances, and even resolvents
based on (nonsymmetric) rotators. As a by-product of recent work on the
proximal average, we obtain a constructive Kirszbraun-Valentine extension
result for generalized firmly nonexpansive mappings. Several examples
illustrate our results.

proven useful for studying planets that orbit stars at Galactic distances, and
it can even be applied to detect planets in neighbouring galaxies. So far,
planet detections by microlensing have been considered to result from a change
in the bending of light and the resulting magnification caused by a planet
around the foreground lens star. However, in complete analogy to the annual
parallax effect caused by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, the
motion of the source star around the common barycentre with an orbiting planet
can also lead to observable deviations in microlensing light curves that can
provide evidence for the unseen companion. We discuss this effect in some
detail and study the prospects of microlensing observations for revealing
planets through this alternative detection channel. Given that small distances
between lens and source star are favoured, and that the effect becomes nearly
independent of the source distance, planets would remain detectable even if
their host star is located outside the Milky Way with a sufficiently good
photometry (exceeding present-day technology) being possible. From synthetic
light curves arising from a Monte-Carlo simulation, we find that the chances
for such detections are not overwhelming and appear practically limited to the
most massive planets (at least with current observational set-ups), but they
are large enough for leaving the possibility that one or the other signal has
already been observed. However, it may remain undetermined whether the planet
actually orbits the source star or rather the lens star, which leaves us with
an ambiguity not only with respect to its location, but also to its properties.

the mass density of local SMBHs. When considering only optically-selected
unobscured AGNs, we derive log_10[epsilon]=-1.77+0.16-0.11 or
epsilon=1.7+0.8-0.4%. Using the AGNs selected using hard X-rays, which include
unabsorbed and Compton-thin absorbed AGNs, we find

optically-selected AGNs, and correcting for the obscured population, we inferr
log_10[epsilon]=-1.17+0.11-0.08 or epsilon=6.7+1.9-1.1%, which we consider our

(M_B<-23, quasars), comparing to the SMBH mass density in local elliptical
galaxies, and find log_10[epsilon]=-1.27+0.15-0.11 or epsilon=5.4+2.2-1.2%. We
discuss how our results can be used to estimate the mean spin of accreting
SMBHs, both assuming the standard thin-disk model of accretion onto black holes
and also comparing to more recent simulations. Our results can rule out
maximally rotating SMBHs (<a>=0.998 Gm_bh/c^2) at the >=98% confidence level,
as well as high rotation values (<a> >=0.9 Gm_bh/c^2) with >=92% confidence.
Our preferred values of <a> are ~0.25-0.60 Gm_bh/c^2, although even these might
be overestimated. Hence, we find that on average, SMBHs are not rapidly
spinning during accretion. Finally, using an independent measurement of
Eddington ratios, we estimate the SMBH e-folding time for the brightest AGNs
(quasars) to be <tau> =100+151-60 Myr.

these inert scalars, the absence of a signal within searches for supersymmetric
neutralinos can be used to constrain the inert doublet model. This translation
however requires some care because of the different properties of the inert
scalars and the neutralinos. We investigate what restrictions an existing
DELPHI collaboration study of neutralino pair production can put on the inert
scalars and discuss the result in connection with dark matter. We find that
although an important part of the inert doublet model parameter space can be
excluded by the LEP II data, the lightest inert particle still constitutes a
valid dark matter candidate.

Previous studies have also detected lateral forces or torques that are
generated between actin and myosin, but the origin and biological role of these
sideways forces is not known. Here we adapt an actin gliding filament assay in
order to measure the rotation of an actin filament about its axis (twirling) as
it is translocated by myosin. We quantify the rotation by determining the
orientation of sparsely incorporated rhodamine-labeled actin monomers, using
polarized total internal reflection (polTIRF) microscopy. In order to determine
the handedness of the filament rotation, linear incident polarizations in
between the standard s- and p-polarizations were generated, decreasing the
ambiguity of our probe orientation measurement four-fold. We found that whole
myosin II and myosin V both twirl actin with a relatively long (micron),
left-handed pitch that is insensitive to myosin concentration, filament length
and filament velocity.

lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with cosmic shear surveys. We
cross-correlate the galaxy counts in the lens plane with two different source
planes: the CMB at $z \sim 1100$ and galaxies at an intermediate redshift. The
ratio of the galaxy count/CMB lensing cross-correlation to the galaxy
count/galaxy lensing cross correlation is shown to be a purely geometric
quantity, depending only on the distribution function of the source galaxies.
By combining Planck, ADEPT and LSST the ratio can be measured to $\sim 4%$
accuracy, whereas a future polarization based experiment like CMBPOL can make a
more precise ($\sim 1%$) measurement. For cosmological models where the
curvature and the equation of state parameter are allowed to vary, the
direction of degeneracy defined by the measurement of this ratio is different
from that traced out by Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements.
Combining this method with the stacked cluster mass reconstruction cosmography
technique as proposed by Hu, Holz and Vale (2007), the uncertainty in the ratio
can be further reduced, improving the constraints on cosmological parameters.
We also study the implications of the lensing-ratio measurement for early dark
energy models, in context of the parameterization proposed by Doran and Robbers
(2006). For models which are degenerate with respect to the CMB, we find both
BAO and lensing-ratio measurements to be insensitive to the early component of

physical ideas of the classical predecessors, the Becker-Doring and
Lifshitz-Slyovoz models. These classical models, which give different
predictions, are asymptotic limits of the new model at small and large cluster
sizes (respectively). Since the new theory is valid for large and small
clusters, it allows for a complete description of the nucleation process;
predicting the Zeldovich nucleation rate, and the diffusion limited growth of
large clusters. By retaining the physically valid ingredients from both models,
we can explain the seeming incompatibilities and arbitrary choices of the
classical models.
  We solve the equations of our new model asymptotically in the small
super-saturation limit. The solution exhibits three successive `eras':
nucleation, growth, and coarsening, each with its specific scales of time and
cluster size. During the nucleation era, the bulk of the clusters are formed by
favorable fluctuations over a free energy barrier, according to the analysis by
Zeldovich. During the Growth era no new clusters are created, and the expansion
of the existing ones continues. Eventually the coarsening era begins. During
this competitive attrition process, smaller clusters dissolve and fuel the
further growth of the larger survivors. By resolving the preceding creation and
growth eras, our analysis gives explicitly the characteristic time and cluster
size of the coarsening era, and a unique selection of the long time,
self-similar cluster size distribution.

a smooth galaxy light distribution, 3) examining the unsubtracted BG cutouts,
and 4) performing a full-frame visual inspection of the ACS images. We compute
purity and completeness and consider investigator time for the four algorithms,
using the main SLACS lenses as a testbed. The first and second algorithms
perform the best. We present the four new lens systems discovered during this
comprehensive search, as well as one other likely candidate. For each new lens
we use the fundamental plane to estimate the lens velocity dispersion and
predict, from the resulting lens geometry, the redshifts of the lensed sources.
Two of these new systems are found in galaxy clusters, which include the SLACS
lenses in the two respective fields. Overall we find that the enhanced lens
abundance (30^{+24}_{-8} lenses/degree^2) is higher than expected for random
fields (12^{+4}_{-2} lenses/degree^2 for the COSMOS survey). Additionally, we
find that the gravitational lenses we detect are qualitatively different from

  To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the TVC model, we use it to
generate synthetic traces that match the characteristics of a number of
qualitatively different mobility traces, including wireless LAN traces,
vehicular mobility traces, and human encounter traces. More importantly, we
show that, despite the high level of realism achieved, our TVC model is still
theoretically tractable. To establish this, we derive a number of important

the hitting time, and the meeting time, and provide examples of how to utilize
this theory to guide design decisions in routing protocols.

importance of a low-energy ($\hbar\omega\sim$7 meV) phonon mode. In neutron

dynamics calculations on SGO reveal a peak in the vibrational density of states
matching with the neutron observations on SGO and SCGO. A strong contribution
in the vibrational density of states comes from the partial contribution of the
Ga atoms on the 2b and 12k sites, involving modes at the M--point of the
hexagonal system. These modes comprise dynamics of the kagom\'e planes of the
pyrochlore slab magnetic sub-lattice, 12k sites, and therefore can drive
magnetic relaxation via spin-phonon coupling. Both BSZCGO and BSZGO show a
similar low-energy Raman peak but no corresponding peak in the neutron
determined density of states of BSZGO is seen. However, a strong non-Debye
enhancement of low-energy phonon response is observed. We attribute this
particular feature to the Zn/Ga disorder on the 2$d$ -site, already evoked

disorder-induced phonon response explains the absence of a characteristic

overtone bandhead (2.2935 um) gives us considerable information on the physical
and geometric characteristics of the regions producing these spectral features.

resembles a significant number of FU Orionis type eruptive variables and does
not appear similar to the quiescent EX Lupi variables observed. This

presence of younger stellar populations and the strength of the AGN, as
measured with [OIII] line luminosity or X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosity. This
finding is consistent with similar studies at lower redshift. Of the three Type
II galaxies, two are disk galaxies and one is of irregular type, while in the
Type I sample there only one disk-like source and four sources with smooth,
elliptical/spheroidal morphologies. In addition, the mid-IR SEDs of the strong
Type II AGN indicate that they are excited to LIRG (Luminous InfraRed Galaxy)
status via galactic starbursting, while the strong Type I AGN are excited to
LIRG status via hot dust surrounding the central AGN. This supports the notion
that the obscured nature of Type II AGN at z~1 is connected with global
starbursting and that they may be extincted by kpc-scale dusty features that

\textbf{14}(2007)] where fast dynamos in twisted magnetic flux tubes in
Riemannian manifolds were obtained. This paper shows that conformal maps, under
the Floquet condition, leads to coincidence between exponential stretching or
Lyapunov exponent, conformal factor of fast dynamos. Unfolding conformal dynamo
maps can be obtained in Riemann-flat manifolds since here, Riemann curvature
plays the role of folding. Previously, Oseledts [Geophys Astrophys Fluid Dyn
\textbf{73} (1993)] has shown that the number of twisted and untwisting orbits
in a two torus on a compact Riemannian manifold induces a growth of fast dynamo
action. In this paper, the stretching of conformal thin magnetic flux tubes is
constrained to vanish, in order to obtain the conformal factor for
non-stretching non-dynamos. Since thin flux tube can be considered as a twisted
or untwisting two-torus map, it is shown that the untwisting, weakly torsion,
and non-stretching conformal torus map cannot support a fast dynamo action, a
marginal dynamo being obtained. This is an example of an anti-fast dynamo
theorem besides the ones given by Vishik and Klapper and Young [Comm Math Phys
\textbf{173}(1996)] in ideally high conductive flow. From the Riemann curvature
tensor it is shown that new conformal non-dynamo, is actually singular as one
approaches the magnetic flux tube axis. Thus conformal map suppresses the
stretching directions and twist, leading to the absence of fast dynamo action
while Riemann-flat unfolding manifolds favors non-fast dynamos.

real differences in the data (some of the Bouret/Heap data were contaminated by
moonlight continua) or the fact we could detect the HeI line needed to better
constrain the temperature. Our new data agrees well with the effective
temperature scale we presented previously. We confirm that the ""Of""

Milky Way stars. We revisit the the issue of the ""mass discrepancy"", finding

to a builder on Earth. For fixed power density in the far field, what is the
cost-optimum interstellar Beacon system? Experience shows an optimum tradeoff,
depending on transmission frequency and on antenna size and power. This emerges
by minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated
power, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a
transmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and
power. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna
area, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between
antenna gain and radiated power. For non-linear power law dependence a similar
simple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems;
industry uses this cost optimum as a rule-of-thumb. Costs of pulsed
cost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations using current
cost parameters ($/W, $/m2) as a basis. Galactic-scale Beacons demand effective
isotropic radiated power >1017 W, emitted powers are >1 GW, with antenna areas
> km2. We show the scaling and give examples of such Beacons. Thrifty beacon
systems would be large and costly, have narrow searchlight beams and short
dwell times when the Beacon would be seen by an alien oberver at target areas
in the sky. They may revisit an area infrequently and will likely transmit at
higher microwave frequencies, ~10 GHz. The natural corridor to broadcast is
along the galactic spiral radius or along the spiral galactic arm we are in.

might be built for wide variety of motives other than twoway communication;
Beacons built to be seen over thousands of light years are such. Altruistic
Beacon builders will have to contend with other altruistic causes, just as
humans do, so may select for economy of effort. Cost, spectral lines near 1 GHz
and interstellar scintillation favor radiating frequencies substantially above
the classic water hole. Therefore the transmission strategy for a distant,
cost-conscious Beacon will be a rapid scan of the galactic plane, to cover the
angular space. Such pulses will be infrequent events for the receiver. Such
Beacons built by distant advanced, wealthy societies will have very different
characteristics from what SETI researchers seek. Future searches should pay
special attention to areas along the galactic disk where SETI searches have
seen coherent signals that have not recurred on the limited listening time
intervals we have used. We will need to wait for recurring events that may

wall carbon nanotubes is predicted as a function of Fermi energy. Armchair
nanotubes do not show any frequency shift while zigzag nanotubes exhibit phonon
softening, but this softening is not associated with the broadening. This
chirality dependence originates from a curvature-induced energy gap and a
special electron-phonon coupling mechanism for radial breathing modes. Because
of the particle-hole symmetry, only the off-site deformation potential
contributes to the frequency shift. On the other hand, the on-site potential
contributes to the Raman intensity, and the radial breathing mode intensity is
stronger than that of the $G$ band. The relationship between the chirality
dependence of the frequency shift of the radial breathing mode and the $\Gamma$

overview of the special indices used to quantify different aspects of variable
solar activity, with special emphasis upon sunspot number. Over long
timescales, quantitative information about past solar activity can only be
obtained using a method based upon indirect proxies, such as the cosmogenic
isotopes \super{14}C and \super{10}Be in natural stratified archives (e.g.,
tree rings or ice cores). We give an historical overview of the development of
the proxy-based method for past solar-activity reconstruction over millennia,
as well as a description of the modern state. Special attention is paid to the
verification and cross-calibration of reconstructions. It is argued that this
method of cosmogenic isotopes makes a solid basis for studies of solar
variability in the past on a long timescale (centuries to millennia) during the
Holocene. A separate section is devoted to reconstructions of strong solar
energetic-particle (SEP) events in the past, that suggest that the present-day
average SEP flux is broadly consistent with estimates on longer timescales, and
that the occurrence of extra-strong events is unlikely. Finally, the main
features of the long-term evolution of solar magnetic activity, including the
statistics of grand minima and maxima occurrence, are summarized and their
possible implications, especially for solar/stellar dynamo theory, are
discussed.

for the customers to ensure a certain level of demand over a medium term

systems to reconcile the order and book processes. In this context, this paper
intends firstly to relate decision under uncertainty and the industrial point
of view based on the notion of risk management. This serves as a basis for the
definition of an approach based on simulation and decision theory that is
dedicated to the design of cooperative processes in a customer-supplier
relationship. This approach includes the evaluation, in terms of risk, of
different cooperative processes using a simulation-dedicated tool. The
evaluation process is based on an exploitation of decision theory concepts and

few convincing candidates of spiral arms opening counter-intuitively in the
same direction as the galaxy disk is rotating. This detection in a luminous IR
galaxy (LIRG) IRAS 18293-3134 is based on near infrared (NIR) adaptive optics
imaging with the Very Large Telescope and long-slit NIR spectroscopy with the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. We discuss the orientation of the galaxy based on
imaging and derive rotation curves from both emission and absorption features
in the spectrum. The galaxy is strongly star-forming and has a minor companion
in a high-velocity encounter. The fact that the arms of IRAS 18293-3134 are not
easily traceable from optical images suggests that larger samples of
high-quality NIR imaging of interacting systems and LIRGs might uncover further
cases of leading arms, placing constraints on spiral arm theories and
retrograde encounters, and especially on the relationship between disk masses
and dark matter halo masses.

  We first review these constraints, and discuss their consequences at the
simulation level, showing how event-based simulation of time-constrained
networks can be simplified in this context: the underlying data-structures are
strongly simplified, while event-based and clock-based mechanisms can be easily
mixed. These ideas are applied to punctual conductance-based generalized
integrate-and-fire neural networks simulation, while spike-response model
simulations are also revisited within this framework.
  As an outcome, a fast minimal complementary alternative with respect to
existing simulation event-based methods, with the possibility to simulate
interesting neuron models is implemented and experimented.

Thus all the Coulomb interaction completely is taken into account in

The general formula for energy of additional correlation interaction is
obtained and the constant of this interaction is determined. The algorithm of
calculation of total energy of two-electron atoms is offered. The outcomes of
calculations for intra-shell states are adduced and compared to the
experimental data . The arguments for the capability of existence of the
analytical solution for a three-body problem in atomic physics are presented.
Some reasons about probable practical consequences are presented. Most

Thermodynamic trajectories for the first 810 ms after core bounce are taken

nucleosynthesis results are characterized by a number of distinct features that
are not shared with those of other supernovae from the collapse of stars with
iron core (with initial stellar masses of more than 10 M_\odot). First is the
small amount of 56Ni (= 0.002-0.004 M_\odot) in the ejecta, which can be an
explanation for observed properties of faint supernovae such as SNe 2008S and
1997D. In addition, the large Ni/Fe ratio is in reasonable agreement with the
spectroscopic result of the Crab nebula (the relic of SN 1054). Second is the
large production of 64Zn, 70Ge, light p-nuclei (74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, and 92Mo),
and in particular, 90Zr, which originates from the low Y_e (= 0.46-0.49, the
number of electrons per nucleon) ejecta. We find, however, that only a 1-2%
increase of the minimum Y_e moderates the overproduction of 90Zr. In contrast,
the production of 64Zn is fairly robust against a small variation of Y_e. This
provides the upper limit of the occurrence of this type of events to be about
30% of all core-collapse supernovae.

represents the radial fundamental pulsation. The groups of p-mode frequencies
appear to lie in the vicinity of consecutive radial overtones, up to the third
one. Despite the large number of g-mode frequencies observed, we failed to
identify them, most likely because of the disruption of asymptotic behaviour by
mode trapping. The observed frequencies were not, however, fully exploited in
terms of seismic analysis which should be done in the future with a larger grid
of reliable evolutionary models of hot subdwarfs.

with Teff = 3800 K. The cooling age for this dwarf is 8.7 Gyr, while that of
the nine ~6000 K white dwarfs is 1.8-3.6 Gyr. We are unable to determine the
masses of the white dwarfs from the existing data, and therefore we cannot
constrain the total ages of the white dwarfs. The large cooling age for the
coolest white dwarf in the sample, combined with its low estimated tangential
velocity, suggests that it is an old member of the thin disk, or a member of
the thick disk of the Galaxy, with an age 10-11 Gyr. The warmer white dwarfs
appear to have velocities typical of the thick disk or even halo; these may be
very old remnants of low-mass stars, or they may be relatively young thin disk

simulations and laboratory laser-plasma experiments can (or will be able to, in
the near future) model realistic gamma-ray burst (GRB) shocks. For this, we
compare the radiative cooling time, t_cool, of relativistic electrons in the
shock magnetic fields to the microscopic dynamical time of collisionless
relativistic shocks -- the inverse plasma frequency of protons, omega_pp^{-1}.
We obtain that for t_cool*omega_pp^{-1}\lesssim ~few hundred, the electrons
cool efficiently at or near the shock jump and are capable of emitiing away a
large fraction of the shock energy. Such shocks are well-resolved in existing
PIC simulations; therefore, the microscopic structure can be studied in detail.
Since most of the emission in such shocks would be coming from the vicinity of
the shock, the spectral power of the emitted radiation can be directly obtained
from finite-length simulations and compared with observational data. Such
radiative shocks correspond to the internal baryon-dominated GRB shocks for the
conventional range of ejecta parameters. Fermi acceleration of electrons in
such shocks is limited by electron cooling, hence the emitted spectrum should
be lacking a non-thermal tail, whereas its peak likely falls in the multi-MeV
range. Incidentally, the conditions in internal shocks are almost identical to
those in laser-produced plasmas; thus, such GRB-like plasmas can be created and
studied in laboratory experiments using the presently available Petawatt-scale
laser facilities. An analysis of the external shocks shows that only the highly
relativistic shocks, corresponding to the extremely early afterglow phase, can
have efficient electron cooling in the shock transition. We emphasize the
importance of radiative PIC simulations for further studies.

either the first higher-order standing spin wave mode, or the fundamental mode

  Film conductivity and lowered symmetry of microwave fields of such

larger also depends on the driving frequency. This effect is explained as
shielding of the asymmetric transducer field by eddy currents in the films.
This shielding remains very efficient for films with thicknesses well below the

translocation of sugar in the pipe-like phloem cell network, spanning the
entire length of the plant. In this paper, we present an experimental and
theoretical study of transient osmotically driven flows through pipes with
semipermeable walls. We extend the experimental work of Eschrich, Evert and
Young \cite[]{Eschrich:1972} by providing a more accurate version of their
experiment allowing for better comparison with theory. In the experiments we
measure the dynamics and structure of a ""sugar front"", i.e. the transport and
decay of a sudden loading of sugar in a pipe which is closed in both ends. We
include measurements of pressure inside the membrane tube allowing us to
compare the experiments directly with theory and, in particular, to confirm
quantitatively the exponential decay of the front in a closed tube.In a novel
setup we are able to measure the entire concentration profile as the sugar
front moves. In contrast to previous studies we find very good agreement
between experiment and theory.
  In the limit of low axial resistance (valid in our experiments as well as in
many cases in plants) we show that the equations can be solved exactly by the
method of characteristics yielding, in general, an implicit solution. Further
we show that under more general conditions the equations of motion can be
rewritten as a single integro-differential equation, which can be readily
solved numerically. The applicability of our results to plants is discussed and
it is shown that it is probable that the pressure-flow hypothesis can account
for short distance transport of sugar in plants.

  From 29 July to 4 August, the typhoons stirred the ocean and upwelled the
deep water, which enhanced the existed cyclonic eddy, and immediately made a
drastic meander of the Kuroshio. Moreover, the unexpected typhoons in June 2004

an alternative meander mechanism of Kuroshio path via typhoon-eddy-Kuroshio

investigated by sea surface measurements and vertical profiles. Pre-typhoon
ocean environment played an important role in this case. There were two extreme
cooling regions located at cyclonic eddy A and typhoon wake B. Although the
magnitudes of SST cooling at A and B were similar, other physical and
biophysical responses were quite different. Combining multi-satellite data with
vertical profile data, it is found that the upwelling dominated the responses
at A and the vertical mixing dominated the responses at B. This study implies
that to insight into the ocean surface responses to typhoon, the subsurface
dynamics need to be analyzed via both the in situ and satellite-based
observations, and the physical and biological models.

inhomogeneous and anisotropic expansion, in and around galaxies, where as the

These contentions lead to a theoretical derivation of the gravitational central

low-mass accreting objects near and far well-known star forming regions. We
have used Virtual Observatory tools to cross-match the IPHAS catalogue with the
2MASS catalogue. We defined photometric criteria to identify Halpha emission
sources with near-infrared colours similar to known young very low-mass stars
and brown dwarfs. 4000 candidates were identified that met our criteria over an
area of 1600 square degrees. We present low-resolution optical spectra of 113
candidates. Spectral types have been derived for the 33 candidates that have
spectroscopically confirmed Halpha emission, negligible reddening and M
spectral class. We have also measured Halpha emission and investigated the NaI
doublet (818.3 nm, 819.5 nm) in these 33 objects. We confirm that 33 IPHAS
candidates have strong Halpha indicative of disk accretion for their spectral
type. 23 of them have spectral class M4 or later, of which 10 have classes in
the range M5.5-M7.0 and thus could be very young brown dwarfs. Also many
objects have weak NaI doublet, an indication of low surface gravity.We conclude
that IPHAS provides a very valuable database to identify accreting very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and that Virtual Observatory tools provide an
efficient method for identifying these objects over large areas of the sky.
Based on our success rate of 23 Halpha emission objects with spectral type in
the range M4-M7 out of 113 candidates with spectroscopic follow-up, we estimate
that there could be hundreds of such objects in the full IPHAS survey.

invariance of the equations of motion for nonrelativistic, purely gravitational
systems; i.e., invariance of the equations of motion under (t,r) goes to
(qt,qr), in the limit a0 goes to infinity. It is suggested that this should
replace the definition of the MOND limit based on the low-acceleration behavior
of a Newtonian-MOND interpolating function. In this way, the salient, deep-MOND
results--asymptotically flat rotation curves, the mass-rotational-speed
relation (baryonic Tully-Fisher relation), the Faber-Jackson relation,
etc.--follow from a symmetry principle. For example, asymptotic flatness of
rotation curves reflects the fact that radii change under scaling, while
velocities do not. I then comment on the interpretation of the deep-MOND limit
as one of ""zero mass"": Rest masses, whose presence obstructs scaling symmetry,
become negligible compared to the ""phantom"", dynamical masses--those that some
would attribute to dark matter. Unlike the former masses, the latter transform
in a way that is consistent with the symmetry. Finally, I discuss the putative
MOND-cosmology connection in light of another, previously known symmetry of the
deep-MOND limit. In particular, it is suggested that MOND is related to the
asymptotic de Sitter geometry of our universe. It is conjectured, for example,
that in an exact de Sitter cosmos, deep-MOND physics would exactly apply to
local systems. I also point out, in this connection, the possible relevance of
a de Sitter-conformal-field-theory (dS/CFT) duality.

motion resonances in extrasolar planetary systems. Turbulence is expected to
arise in the disks that form planets, and these fluctuations act to compromise
resonant configurations. This paper extends previous work by considering how
interactions between the planets and possible damping effects imposed by the
disk affect the outcomes. These physical processes are studied using three
approaches: numerical integrations of the 3-body problem with additional
forcing due to turbulence, model equations that reduce the problem to
stochastically driven oscillators, and Fokker-Planck equations that describe
the time evolution of an ensemble of systems. With this combined approach, we
elucidate the physics of how turbulence can remove extrasolar planetary systems
from mean motion resonance. As expected, systems with sufficiently large
damping (dissipation) can maintain resonance, in spite of turbulent forcing. In
the absence of strong damping, ensembles of these systems exhibit two regimes
of behavior, where the fraction of the bound states decreases as a power-law or
as an exponential. Both types of behavior can be understood through the model
developed herein. For systems with weak interactions between planets, the model
reduces to a stochastic pendulum, and the fraction of bound states decreases as
a power-law. For highly interactive systems, the dynamics are more complicated
and the fraction of bound states decreases exponentially. We show how planetary
interactions lead to drift terms in the Fokker-Planck equation and account for
this exponential behavior. In addition to clarifying the physical processes
involved, this paper strengthens the finding that turbulence implies that mean
motions resonances should be rare.

process of Higgs production associated with two bottom quarks at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). Our study is restricted to the Standard Model (SM).
  At tree-level Higgs production in association with a b-quark pair proceeds
through the small Yukawa bottom coupling in the Standard Model. Even in the
limit where this coupling vanishes, EW one-loop effects, through the top-Higgs
Yukawa coupling in particular, can still trigger this reaction. This
contribution is small for Higgs masses around 120GeV but it quickly picks up
for higher Higgs masses especially because the one-loop amplitude develops a
leading Landau singularity and new thresholds open up. These effects can be
viewed as the production of a pair of top quarks which rescatter to give rise
to Higgs production through WW fusion. An important part of the thesis is
devoted to the topic of Landau singularities in one-loop Feynman diagrams and
application to the specific process of bbH production at the LHC.
  Since the 4-point leading Landau singularity is not integrable when the
one-loop amplitude is squared, we regulate the cross section by taking into
account the width of the internal top and W particles. This requires that we
extend the usual box one-loop function to the case of complex masses. We show
how this can be implemented analytically in our case.
  We study in some detail the cross section at the LHC as a function of the
Higgs mass and show how some distributions can be drastically affected compared

of states decreases exponentially at the pertinent frequencies with a linearly

field theory and dual supergravity descriptions of these phenomena. While to
the leading order in momenta the dispersion of the sound waves obtained from
