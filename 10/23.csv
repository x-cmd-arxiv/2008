superconductivity in the underdoped cuprate superconductors, we investigate the
manner in which such charge order will influence the quasiparticle excitations
of the system and, in particular, the low-temperature transport of heat by
those quasiparticles. We consider a d-wave superconductor in which the
superconductivity coexists with charge density wave order of wave vector
(\pi/a,0). While the nodes of the quasiparticle energy spectrum survive the
onset of charge order, there exists a critical value of the charge density wave
order parameter beyond which the quasiparticle spectrum becomes fully gapped.
We perform a linear response Kubo formula calculation of thermal conductivity
in the low temperature (universal) limit. Results reveal the dependence of
thermal transport on increasing charge order up to the critical value at which
the quasiparticle spectrum becomes fully gapped and thermal conductivity
vanishes. In addition to numerical results, closed-form expressions are
obtained in the clean limit for the special case of isotropic Dirac nodes.
Signatures of the influence of charge order on low-temperature thermal

it is often used for QCD and monte carlo studies, here we propose the

the replacement of spatial disorder by temporal memory, is extended in several
practical directions. Restricting attention to a 1-dimensional system with bond
disorder for specificity, a transformation procedure is developed to deduce,
from given distribution functions characterizing the system disorder, explicit
expressions for the memory functions. It is shown how to use the memory
functions in the Lapace domain forms in which they first appear, and in the
time domain forms which are obtained via numerical inversion algorithms, to
address time evolution of the system beyond the asymptotic domain of large
times normally treated. An analytic but approximate procedure is provided to
obtain the memories, in addition to the inversion algorithm. Good agreement of
effective medium theory predictions with numerically computed exact results is
found for all time ranges for the distributions used except near the
percolation limit as expected. The use of ensemble averages is studied for
normal as well as correlation observables. The effect of size on effective
mediumtheory is explored and it is shown that, even in the asymptotic limit,
finite size corrections develop to the well known harmonic mean prescription
for finding the effective rate. A percolation threshold is shown to arise even
in 1-d for finite (but not infinite) systems at a concentration of broken bonds
related to the system size. Spatially long range transfer rates are shown to
emerge naturally as a consequence of the replacement of spatial disorder by
temporal memories, in spite of the fact that the original rates possess nearest
neighbor character. Pausing time distributions in continuous time random walks
corresponding to the effective medium memories are calculated.

dark-matter annihilation and/or decay mainly produces the standard model
leptons, while negligible amount of the antiproton is produced. To illustrate
such a simple idea, we consider a scenario that a right-handed sneutrino dark
matter decays into the standard model particles through tiny R-parity violating
interactions. Interestingly enough, charged leptons as well as neutrinos are
directly produced, and they can lead to a sharp peak in the predicted positron
fraction. Moreover, the decay of the right-handed sneutrino also generates
diffuse continuum gamma rays which may account for the excess observed by
EGRET, while the primary antiproton flux can be suppressed. Those predictions
on the cosmic-ray fluxes of the positrons, gamma rays and antiprotons will be
tested by the PAMELA and FGST observatories.

effect has been a strong stimulus for the development of atom interferometry
because of the potential 10^{10} enhancement of the rotational phase shift in
comparison to optical Sagnac gyroscopes. Here we analyze ballistic transport of
matter waves in a one dimensional chain of N coherently coupled quantum rings
in the presence of a rotation of angular frequency, \Omega. We show that the
transmission probability, T, exhibits zero transmission stop gaps as a function
of the rotation rate interspersed with regions of rapidly oscillating finite
transmission. With increasing N, the transition from zero transmission to the
oscillatory regime becomes an increasingly sharp function of \Omega with a
slope \partialT/\partial \Omega N^2. The steepness of this slope dramatically
enhances the response to rotations in comparison to conventional single ring
interferometers such as the Mach-Zehnder and leads to a phase sensitivity well
below the standard quantum limit.

observations of the single pulses from radio pulsars are displayed in a
two-dimensional projection of the Poincare sphere. In many pulsars, the
projections produce two clusters of data points that reside at antipodal points
on the sphere. The clusters are formed by fluctuations in polarization
amplitude that are parallel to the unit vectors representing the polarization
states of the wave propagation modes in the pulsar magnetosphere. In other
pulsars, however, the patterns are more complex, resembling annuli and bow ties
or bars. The formation of these complex patterns is not understood and largely
unexplored. An empirical model of pulsar polarization is used to show that
these patterns arise from polarization fluctuations that are perpendicular to
the mode vectors. The model also shows that the modulation index of the
polarization amplitude is an indicator of polarization pattern complexity. A
stochastic version of generalized Faraday rotation can cause the orientation of
the polarization vectors to fluctuate and is a possible candidate for the
perpendicular fluctuations incorporated in the model. Alternative models
indicate that one mode experiences perpendicular fluctuations and the other
does not, suggesting that the fluctuations could also be due to a
mode-selective random process, such as scattering in the magnetosphere. A
polarization stability analysis of the patterns implies that processes
intrinsic to the emission are more effective in depolarizing the emission than
fluctuations in the orientation of its polarization vector.

examining the lepton flavor structure of the observed events, one could further
test the model predictions related to the neutrino mass spectrum. In

dependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasar
color, and radio loudness. At $z<2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly on
luminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim
10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. These weak dependences are
consistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,
virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted any
clustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantity
that best correlates with clustering strength. However, the most luminous and
most massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)
than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase of
the bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. We do not observe a strong
dependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. On the
other hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quiet
quasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),
consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 AGN.
Thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in the
biased halo clustering picture. Using the Sheth et al.(2001) formula for the
linear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim
10^{13} h^{-1}M_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}M_\odot$ for

modifying the latest version of the LensPix code (Lewis 2005) to account for

also observe how non-linear lensing power in the polarised CMB is transferred

boosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a
catalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding from
dissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form
fully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. However,
once the gas is enriched to Z ~ 0.01-0.1 solar, the subsequent star formation

We argue that analogous strongly correlated normal states exist in

destroyed by fast rotation. These states have non-universal properties, and if
they develop as distinct thermodynamic phases they can be characterized as
quantum Hall states of Cooper pairs. The formal analysis is based on a model
with SP(2N) symmetry that describes the quantum critical region in the vicinity
of a broad Feshbach resonance. We explore the pairing phase diagram and
demonstrate that the considered model has macroscopically degenerate bosonic

interactions to lift this degeneracy, making the Abrikosov flux lattice of the

technique called ""best-matching"", as an evolving 3-geometry subject to
constraints. These constraints can be thought of as a way of imposing temporal
and spatial relationalism. The same type of constraints can be used in
non-relativistic particle models to produce relational theories that suffer
from the same Problem of Time as that encountered in General Relativity. As a
result, these simple toy models are well suited for studying the Problem of
Time in quantum gravity. In this paper, a version of these particle models is
studied where we ""best-match"" the time translational invariance of the theory.
Using insights gained from this procedure, we can move back and forth between
absolute and relational time by changing the way in which the relational fields
are varied. We then proceed to quantize this theory using Dirac and path
integral quantizations. We discover that one of the constraints of the theory,
which we call the Mach constraint, is responsible for removing the dependence
of the theory on a background structure. It is this Mach constraint that is
responsible for making the theory temporally relational. Because of the deep
relationship between these models and General Relativity, this work may shed

investigate the interrelation of a central stellar magnetosphere and stellar
wind with a surrounding magnetized disk outflow and how the overall formation
of a large scale jet is affected. The initial magnetic field distribution
applied is a superposition of two components - a stellar dipole and a
surrounding disk magnetic field, in both either parallel or anti-parallel
alignment. Correspondingly, the mass outflow is launched as stellar wind plus a
disk wind. Our simulations evolve from an initial state in hydrostatic
equilibrium and an initially force-free magnetic field configuration. Due to
initial differential rotation and induction of a strong toroidal magnetic field
the stellar dipolar field inflates and is disrupted on large scale. Stellar and
disk wind may evolve in a pair of collimated outflows. The existence of a
reasonably strong disk wind component is essential for collimation. A disk jet
as known from previous numerical studies will become de-collimated by the
stellar wind. In some simulations we observe the generation of strong flares
triggering a sudden change in the outflow mass loss rate by a factor of two and
also a re-distribution in the radial profile of momentum flux and jet velocity
across the jet. We discuss the hypothesis that these flares may trigger
internal shocks in the asymptotic jets which are observed as knots.

transmission that is commonplace in the field of information theory as
developed by Claude Shannon, but there is open debate about whether such
language is anything more than facile metaphor. Philosophers of biology have
argued that when biologists talk about information in genes and in evolution,
they are not talking about the sort of information that Shannon's theory
addresses. First, philosophers have suggested that Shannon theory is only
useful for developing a shallow notion of correlation, the so-called ""causal
sense"" of information. Second they typically argue that in genetics and
evolutionary biology, information language is used in a ""semantic sense,""
whereas semantics are deliberately omitted from Shannon theory. Neither
critique is well-founded. Here we propose an alternative to the causal and
semantic senses of information: a transmission sense of information, in which
an object X conveys information if the function of X is to reduce, by virtue of
its sequence properties, uncertainty on the part of an agent who observes X.
The transmission sense not only captures much of what biologists intend when
they talk about information in genes, but also brings Shannon's theory back to
the fore. By taking the viewpoint of a communications engineer and focusing on
the decision problem of how information is to be packaged for transport, this
approach resolves several problems that have plagued the information concept in
biology, and highlights a number of important features of the way that
information is encoded, stored, and transmitted as genetic sequence.

by SDSS as a faint source with z_AB = 20.1 +/- 0.1, just below the
signal--to--noise ratio limit of the SDSS high-redshift quasar survey. The
faint z-band magnitude is a consequence of the weak Ly alpha/N V emission line,
which has a rest-frame equivalent width of only ~20 A and provides only a small
boost to the z-band flux. Nevertheless, there is no evidence from this
UKIDSS-based search for a significant population of high-redshift quasars with
weak emission lines. The Ly alpha optical depth to ULAS J1319+0950 is
consistent with that measured towards similarly distant SDSS quasars, implying
that results from optical- and NIR-selected quasars may be combined.
  Also presented is a new NIR-spectrum of the previously discovered UKIDSS
quasar ULAS J020332.38+001229.2, which reveals the object to be a broad

neighbors. Suppose there are d independent rare features, each having its own
independent statistics. A point x will have x_{i}=0 denote the absence of
feature i, and x_{i}=1 its existence. Sparsity means that usually x_{i}=0.
Distance between points is a variant of the Hamming distance. Dimensional
reduction converts the sparse heterogeneous problem into a lower dimensional
full homogeneous problem. However we will see that the converted problem can be
much harder to solve than the original problem. Instead we suggest a direct
approach. It consists of T tries. In try t we rearrange the coordinates in
decreasing order of (1-r_{t,i})\frac{p_{i,11}}{p_{i,01}+p_{i,10}}
\ln\frac{1}{p_{i,1*}} where 0<r_{t,i}<1 are uniform pseudo-random numbers, and
the p's are the coordinate's statistical parameters. The points are
lexicographically ordered, and each is compared to its neighbors in that order.
  We analyze a generalization of this algorithm, show that it is optimal in
some class of algorithms, and estimate the necessary number of tries to
success. It is governed by an information like function, which we call
bucketing forest information. Any doubts whether it is ""information"" are
dispelled by another paper, where unrestricted bucketing information is
defined.

points $P_{3, 5, 6}$} are general points which are possessed by all
quintessence models regardless of the form of potentials and the rest points
are closely connected to the concrete potentials. It is quite surprising that,
apart from the exponential potential, there are a large number of potentials
which can give the scaling solution when the function
$f(\lambda)(=\Gamma(\lambda)-1)$ equals zero for one or some values of
$\lambda_{*}$ and if the parameter $\lambda_{*}$ also satisfies the condition
Eq.(16) or Eq.(17) at the same time. We give the differential equations to
derive these potentials $V(\phi)$ from $f(\lambda)$. We also find that, if some
conditions are satisfied, the de-Sitter-like dominant point $P_4$ and the

$P_9$ and $P_{10}$ can not be stable simultaneity. Although we survey scaling
solutions beyond the exponential potential for ordinary quintessence models in

operations 0*inf, inf - inf, inf/inf, and 0/0 become defined.
  In this way no operation remains that gives rise to an error condition.
Mathematically questionable features of the floating-point standard become
well-defined sets of reals. Interval semantics provides a basis for the
verification of numerical algorithms. We derive the results of the newly
defined operations and consider the implications for hardware implementation.

tomography to a radio polarization data set in the direction of the Galactic
anti-centre. We address the problem of missing large-scale structure in our
data, and show that this does not play an important role for the results we
present. The main peak of the Faraday depth spectra in our data set is not
measurably resolved for about 8% of the lines of sight. An unresolved peak
indicates a separation between the regions with Faraday rotation and
synchrotron emission. However, cosmic rays pervade the ISM, and synchrotron
emission would therefore also be produced where there is Faraday rotation. We
suggest that the orientation of the magnetic field can separate the two
effects. By modelling the thermal electron contribution to the Faraday depth,
we map the strength of the magnetic field component along the line of sight.
Polarized point sources in our data set have rotation measures that are
comparable to the Faraday depths of the diffuse emission in our data. Our
Faraday depth maps show narrow canals of low polarized intensity. We conclude
that depolarization over the telescope beam produces at least some of these
canals. Finally, we investigate the properties of one conspicuous region in
this data set and argue that it is created by a decrease in line-of-sight
depolarization compared to its surroundings.

these two parts. For each DAG in the estimated equivalence class, we use
intervention calculus to estimate the causal effects of the covariates on the

local approach is computationally fast and feasible in high-dimensional

having the defining characteristic that the energy landscape is a fixed
realization of a random field. Examples include various models of glasses and
polymers. They also arise in other areas, like fitness models in evolutionary
biology. The ground state of a disordered system is the state with minimum
energy. The system is said to be chaotic if a small perturbation of the energy
landscape causes a drastic shift of the ground state. We present a rigorous
theory of chaos in disordered systems that confirms long-standing physics
intuition about connections between chaos, anomalous fluctuations of the ground
state energy, and the existence of multiple valleys in the energy landscape.
Combining these results with mathematical tools like hypercontractivity, we
establish the existence of the above phenomena in eigenvectors of GUE matrices,
the Kauffman-Levin model of evolutionary biology, directed polymers in random

allows compression and interpretation of nonnegative data. NMF became widely
studied after the publication of the seminal paper by Lee and Seung (Learning
the Parts of Objects by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, Nature, 1999, vol.
401, pp. 788--791), which introduced an algorithm based on Multiplicative
Updates (MU). More recently, another class of methods called Hierarchical
Alternating Least Squares (HALS) was introduced that seems to be much more
efficient in practice.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating a not necessarily
nonnegative matrix with the product of two nonnegative matrices, which we refer
to as Nonnegative Factorization (NF); this is the subproblem that HALS methods
implicitly try to solve at each iteration. We prove that NF is NP-hard for any
fixed factorization rank, using a reduction to the maximum edge biclique
problem.
  We also generalize the multiplicative updates to NF, which allows us to shed
some light on the differences between the MU and HALS algorithms for NMF and
give an explanation for the better performance of HALS. Finally, we link
stationary points of NF with feasible solutions of the biclique problem to
obtain a new type of biclique finding algorithm (based on MU) whose iterations
have an algorithmic complexity proportional to the number of edges in the
graph, and show that it performs better than comparable existing methods.

physical processes and environments associated with astrophysical populations.
Techniques such as blind source separation (BSS), in which sets of spectra are
decomposed into a number of components, offer the prospect of identifying the
signatures of the underlying physical emission processes. Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) has been applied with some success but is severely limited by
the inherent orthogonality restriction that the components must satisfy.
  Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a relatively new BSS technique
that incorporates a non-negativity constraint on its components. In this
respect, the resulting components may more closely reflect the physical
emission signatures than is the case using PCA. We discuss some of the
considerations that must be made when applying NMF and, through its application
to the quasar spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR6, we show that
NMF is a fast method for generating compact and accurate reconstructions of the
spectra.
  The ability to reconstruct spectra accurately has numerous astrophysical
applications. Combined with improved SDSS redshifts, we apply NMF to the
problem of defining robust continua for quasars that exhibit strong broad
absorption line (BAL) systems. The resulting catalogue of SDSS DR6 BAL quasars
will be the largest available. Importantly, the NMF approach allows
quantitative error estimates to be derived for the Balnicity Indices as a
function of key astrophysical and observational parameters, such as the quasar
redshifts and the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.

models (KCSM) when the initial distribution $\nu$ is different from the
reversible one, $\mu$. This setting has been intensively studied in the physics
literature to analyze the slow dynamics which follows a sudden quench from the
liquid to the glass phase. We concentrate on two basic oriented KCSM: the East
model on $\bbZ$, for which the constraint requires that the East neighbor of
the to-be-update vertex is vacant and the model on the binary tree introduced
in \cite{Aldous:2002p1074}, for which the constraint requires the two children
to be vacant. While the former model is ergodic at any $p\neq 1$, the latter
displays an ergodicity breaking transition at $p_c=1/2$. For the East we prove
exponential convergence to equilibrium with rate depending on the spectral gap
if $\nu$ is concentrated on any configuration which does not contain a forever
blocked site or if $\nu$ is a Bernoulli($p'$) product measure for any $p'\neq
1$. For the model on the binary tree we prove similar results in the regime
$p,p'<p_c$ and under the (plausible) assumption that the spectral gap is
positive for $p<p_c$. By constructing a proper test function we also prove that
if $p'>p_c$ and $p\leq p_c$ convergence to equilibrium cannot occur for all
local functions. Finally we present a very simple argument (different from the
one in \cite{Aldous:2002p1074}) based on a combination of combinatorial results

the coverage accuracy is at least $O(n^{-1/2})$ and our simulation studies show
that in comparison with empirical likelihood-based methods, the smoothing used
in WELRCI generally provides a shorter confidence interval with comparable
coverage accuracy. For interval censored data, it is interesting to find that
with an adjusted rate $n^{-1/3}$, the weighted empirical log-likelihood ratio
has an asymptotic distribution completely different from that obtained by the
empirical likelihood approach and the resulting WELRCI perform favorably in the

gaugino condensation terms or one such term with threshold corrections are
considered. It is shown that the gravitino mass may be much smaller than the
Hubble scale during inflation if at least one of the non-perturbative terms has
a positive exponent. Higher order corrections to the Kahler potential have to
be taken into account in such models. Those corrections are used to stabilize

microscopic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport approach for different
scenarios of charm interactions with the surrounding matter - the 'comover'
dissociation by mesons with further recreation by D+Dbar channels and
'pre-hadronic' interaction scenarios. While at SPS energies the hadronic
'comover' absorption scenario is found to be compatible with the experimental
data, the dynamics of c and cbar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or
'pre-hadronic' interactions in the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma stage
and cannot be modeled by pure hadronic interactions. We find that the
collective flow of charm in the purely hadronic scenario appears compatible
with the data at SPS energies but underestimates the data at top RHIC energies.
Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D mesons and the low R_AA(pT) of J/Psi seen
experimentally at RHIC have to be attributed to early interactions of
non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic
interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi
rapidity distribution from p+p to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC
energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of high-pT
J/Psi's in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a fraction of final J/Psi
mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.

states. The IR-optical-UV continuum spectrum of the variable component
corresponds to a power law with a constant slope of -1.6, while in the 2.4-10
keV X-ray band it varies in slope from -1.1 to -1.6. The steepest X-ray
spectrum occurs at a flux minimum. During a decline in flux from maximum in
late 2006, the optical and 43 GHz core polarization vectors rotate by ~300
degrees. The continuum spectrum agrees with steady injection of relativistic
electrons with a power-law energy distribution of slope -3.2 that is steepened

minimum comes most likely from a new component that starts in an upstream

be associated to any spectral curve. When the spectral curve arises from a
matrix model, this nonperturbative partition function is given by a sum of
matrix integrals over all possible filling fractions, and includes all the
multi-instanton corrections to the perturbative 1/N expansion. We show that the
nonperturbative partition function, which is manifestly holomorphic, is also
modular and background independent: it transforms as the partition function of
a twisted fermion on the spectral curve. Therefore, modularity is restored by
nonperturbative corrections. We also show that this nonperturbative partition
function obeys the Hirota equation and provides a natural nonperturbative
completion for topological string theory on local Calabi-Yau threefolds.

the minute NNLO effects of a few percent, despite of the fact that the
dynamical NNLO uncertainties are somewhat smaller than the NLO ones and both
are, as expected, smaller than those of their `standard' counterparts. The

phase separation in the Hubbard model with on-site repulsive electron-electron

superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) manganites originate from
a strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) combined with unavoidable disorder.
Attractive electron correlations, caused by an almost unretarded EPI, are
sufficient to overcome the direct inter-site Coulomb repulsion in these
charge-transfer Mott-Hubbard insulators, so that low energy physics is that of
small polarons and small bipolarons (real-space electron (hole) pairs dressed
by phonons). They form clusters localised by disorder below the mobility edge,
but propagate as the Bloch states above the mobility edge. I identify the
Froehlich finite-range EPI with optical phonons as the most essential for
pairing and phase separation in superconducting layered cuprates. The pairing
of oxygen holes into heavy bipolarons in the paramagnetic phase
(current-carrier density collapse (CCDC)) explains also CMR of doped manganites
due to magnetic break-up of bipolarons in the ferromagnetic phase. Here I
briefly present an explanation of high and low-resistance phase coexistence
near the ferromagnetic transition as a mixture of polaronic ferromagnetic and
bipolaronic paramagnetic domains due to unavoidable disorder in doped

relativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant radio
haloes, which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation at
cluster center. Radio haloes require that the emitting electrons are
accelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles)
by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. They are found only in a
fraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests a
connection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. Here we report a radio
halo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster Abell 521. This
halo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequency
cut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 GHz
(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).
The spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of the
relativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, which
suggests that many radio haloes in the Universe should emit mainly at low
frequencies.

indeed, can be depleted in the convection zone of unevolved stars. The
understanding of the hydrodynamics of the crucial zone near the bottom of the
convective envelope in dwarfs or turn-off stars of solar metallicity has
recently made enormous progress with the inclusion of internal gravity waves.
However, similar work for metal-poor stars is still lacking. Therefore it is
not yet clear whether the depletion occurring in the metal-poor stars
themselves is adequate to produce a 7Li plateau. The second problem pertains to
the large amount of 6Li recently found in metal-poor halo stars. The
convection-related asymmetry of the 7Li line could mimic the signal attributed
so far to the weak blend of 6Li in the red wing of the 7Li line. Theoretical
computations show that the signal generated by the asymmetry of 7Li is 2.0,
2.1, and 3.7 per cent for [Fe/H]= -3.0, -2.0, -1.0, respectively (Teff =6250 K

is that the 6Li plateau can be reinterpreted in terms of intrinsic line
asymmetry, without the need to invoke a contribution of 6Li. (abridged)

  Formulation",,,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In quantum field theory the path integral is usually formulated in the wave
picture, i.e., as a sum over field evolutions. This path integral is difficult
to define rigorously because of analytic problems whose resolution may
ultimately require knowledge of non-perturbative or even Planck scale physics.
Alternatively, QFT can be formulated directly in the particle picture, namely
as a sum over all multi-particle paths, i.e., over Feynman graphs. This path
integral is well-defined, as a map between rings of formal power series. This
suggests a program for determining which structures of QFT are provable for
this path integral and thus are combinatorial in nature, and which structures
are actually sensitive to analytic issues. For a start, we show that the fact
that the Legendre transform of the sum of connected graphs yields the effective
action is indeed combinatorial in nature and is thus independent of analytic

through the conformal transformation (i.e., in the so-called Einstein frame)
the singularity becomes the infinite-time one. Furthermore, we investigate the
relations between the scalar field theories with realizing a crossing of the

the inverse conformal transformation. It is demonstrated that the scalar field
theories describing the non-phantom phase (phantom one with the Big Rip) can be
represented as the theories of real (complex) $F(R)$ gravity through the
inverse (complex) conformal transformation. We also study a viable model of
modified gravity in which the transition from the de Sitter universe to the
phantom phase can occur. In addition, we explore the stability for the obtained
solutions of the crossing of the phantom divide under a quantum correction

Littlewood's conjecture amounts to saying that Z^2 is GL. We then prove
existence of GL lattices by first establishing a dimension bound for the set of
possible exceptions. Existence of vectors (GL-vectors) in R^d with special
Diophantine properties is proved by similar methods. For dimension d >= 3 we
give explicit constructions of GL lattices (and in fact a much stronger
property). We also show that GLC is implied by a conjecture of G. A. Margulis

due to the fact that photons only couple directly to charged particles and the
Higgs only couples to particles with mass acquired via Higgs mechanism.
Although in MSSM the contribution from the process $\gamma\gamma\to A^0$ is too
small, it has been found that in a more general 2HDM it could be enhanced. On
the other hand, the boson $A^0$ can decay in $W^- H^+$ at tree level and the
charged Higgs can decay in fermions. So, the whole process under study is
$\gamma\gamma\to A^0\to (W^-\to l\nu) (H^+\to f_if_j)$ in 2HDM-III. Evidence
about charged Higgs existence could demonstrate that structure of the Higgs

the approach fails due to the pathology of the Dirac delta-potential, making it
impossible to reach convergence by gradually increasing the size of the Hilbert

renormalizing the strength of the contact potential when diagonalizing in a
truncated Hilbert space. One hereby relies on the comparison of the CI results
to the two-body ground-state energy obtained by the exact solution of the
Schroedinger equation for a regularized contact interaction. We here discuss a
scheme that provides cutoff-independent few-body physical observables. The

instabilities can play in the isotropization and equilibration of a quark-gluon
plasma. In particular, we determine, among other things, how much collisions
between the particles can reduce the growth rate of unstable modes. This is
done both in a model calculation using the hard-loop approximation, as well as
in a real-time lattice simulation combining both classical Yang-Mills-fields as
well as inter-particle collisions. The new extended version of the simulation
is also used to investigate jet transport in isotropic media, leading to a
cutoff-independent result for the transport coefficient q-hat. The precise
determination of such transport coefficients is essential, since they can
provide important information about the medium created in heavy-ion collisions.
In anisotropic media, the effect of instabilities on jet transport is studied,
leading to a possible explanation for the experimental observation that
high-energy jets traversing the plasma perpendicular to the beam axis
experience much stronger broadening in rapidity than in azimuth. The
investigation of collective modes in the hard-loop limit is extended to
fermionic modes, which are shown to be all stable. Finally, we study the
possibility of using high energy photon production as a tool to experimentally
determine the anisotropy of the created system. Knowledge of the degree of
local momentum-space anisotropy reached in a heavy-ion collision is essential
for the study of instabilities and their role for isotropization and
thermalization, because their growth rate depends strongly on the anisotropy

spectrum. The 2dFGRS data are used to discriminate between unified models of
the dark sector (a purely baryonic matter component of roughly 5 percent of the
total energy content and roughly 95 percent generalized Chaplygin gas) and
different models, for which there is separate dark matter, in addition to that
accounted for by the generalized Chaplygin gas. Leaving the corresponding
density parameters free, we find that the unified models are strongly
disfavored. On the other hand, using unified model priors, the observational
data are also well described, in particular for small and large values of the
