using a simple two component dark matter model (2DM). The two particle species
in the dark matter sector are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in the early
universe. While one particle is stable and is the present day dark matter, the
second one is metastable and decays after the universe is 10^-8 s old. In this
model it is simple to accommodate the large boost factors required to explain
the PAMELA positron excess without the need for large spikes in the local dark
matter density. We provide the constraints on the parameters of the model and
comment on possible signals at future colliders.

dependence on the growth of structure and on geometric factors. Since much of
the cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinear
clustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded by
non-Gaussian covariances. Recently there have been conflicting studies about
the level of this degradation. We use the halo model to estimate it and include
new contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, following
Rimes and Hamilton's study of 3D simulations. We find that non-Gaussian
correlations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulative
signal-to-noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5
for a worst-case model that exceeds current N-body simulation predictions).
However, using an eight-parameter Fisher analysis we find that the marginalized
errors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10% (or 20% for the
worst-case model). The smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarily
because: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space are
degraded much less than the volume of the full Fisher ellipsoid; lensing
involves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-Gaussian
effect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors which
are not degraded at all. We contrast our findings with those of Lee & Pen
(2008) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content. Finally,
our results give a useful guide for exploring survey design by giving the
cosmological information returns for varying survey area, depth and the level
of some systematic errors.

fact that the twisted de Rham complex is only Z_2-graded, and so the definition
of analytic torsion in this case uses pseudo-differential operators and residue
traces. We show that when dim X is odd, then the twisted analytic torsion is
independent of the choice of metrics on X and E and of the representative H in
the cohomology class of H. We define twisted analytic torsion in the context of
generalized geometry and show that when H is a 3-form, the deformation H -> H -

magnetic hot stars with a line-driven stellar wind and a rotation-aligned
dipole magnetic field. Our analysis here is based on our previous 2-D numerical
MHD simulation study that examines the interplay among wind, field, and
rotation as a function of two dimensionless parameters, one characterizing the
wind magnetic confinement ($\eta_{\ast} \equiv B_{eq}^{2} R_{\ast}^{2}/{\dot M}
v_{\infty}$), and the other the ratio ($W \equiv V_{rot}/V_{orb}$) of stellar
rotation to critical (orbital) speed. We compare and contrast the 2-D, time
variable angular momentum loss of this dipole model of a hot-star wind with the
classical 1-D steady-state analysis by Weber and Davis (WD), who used an
idealized monopole field to model the angular momentum loss in the solar wind.
Despite the differences, we find that the total angular momentum loss ${\dot
J}$ averaged over both solid angle and time follows closely the general WD
scaling ${\dot J} = (2/3) {\dot M} \Omega R_{A}^{2}$, where ${\dot M}$ is the
mass loss rate, $\Omega$ is the stellar angular velocity, and $R_{A}$ is a
characteristic Alfv\'{e}n radius. However, a key distinction here is that for a
dipole field, this Alfv\'{e}n radius has a strong-field scaling $R_{A}/R_{\ast}
\approx \eta_{\ast}^{1/4}$, instead of the scaling $R_{A}/R_{\ast} \sim
\sqrt{\eta_{\ast}}$ for a monopole field. This leads to a slower stellar
spindown time that in the dipole case scales as $\tau_{spin} = \tau_{mass}
1.5k/\sqrt{\eta_{\ast}}$, where $\tau_{mass} \equiv M/{\dot M}$ is the
characteristic mass loss time, and $k$ is the dimensionless factor for stellar
moment of inertia. The full numerical scaling relation we cite gives typical
spindown times of order 1 Myr for several known magnetic massive stars.

to be constant in parameter space. Therefore, when calculating the covariance
matrix (analytically or from simulations), its underlying cosmology should not
influence the likelihood contours. We examine whether the aforementioned
assumption holds and quantify how strong cosmic shear covariances vary within a
reasonable parameter range. Furthermore, we examine the impact on likelihood
contours when assuming different cosmologies in the covariance. We find that
covariances vary significantly within the considered parameter range
(Omega_m=[0.2;0.4], sigma_8=[0.6;1.0]) and that this has a non-negligible
impact on the size of likelihood contours. This impact increases with
increasing survey size, increasing number density of source galaxies,
decreasing ellipticity noise, and when using non-Gaussian covariances. To
improve on the assumption of a constant covariance we present two methods. The
adaptive covariance is the most accurate method, but it is computationally
expensive. To reduce the computational costs we give a scaling relation for
covariances. As a second method we outline the concept of an iterative
likelihood analysis. Here, we additionally account for non-Gaussianity using a
ray-tracing covariance derived from the Millennium simulation.

contribute to the brightness scatter of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The
purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility to decrease this
scatter by correcting individual SNe Ia using observations of galaxies in the
foreground, without introducing any extra bias. We simulate a large number of
SN Ia lines of sight populated by galaxies. For each line of sight the true
magnification factor and an estimate thereof are calculated. The estimated
magnification factor corresponds to what an observer would infer from a survey
like SNLS. Using the simulated data we investigate the possibility to estimate
the magnification of individual supernovae with enough precision to be able to
correct their brightness for gravitational lensing with negligible bias. Our
simulations show that the bias arising from gravitational lensing corrections
of individual SNe Ia is negligible for current and next generation surveys and
that the scatter from lensing can be reduced by approximately a factor 2. The
total scatter in the SN Ia magnitudes could be reduced by 4% for an intrinsic
dispersion of 0.13 mag. For an intrinsic dispersion of 0.09 mag, which might
not be to unrealistic for future surveys, the total scatter could be reduced by
6%. This will reduce the errors on cosmological parameters derived from
supernova data by 4-8%. The prospect of correcting for lensing is thus very
good.

investigate the physical parameters underlying the well-known color-magnitude
and color-sigma relations. Galaxies are sorted in terms of velocity dispersions
(sigma), luminosity (L), and color, and their spectra are stacked to obtain
very high S/N mean spectra for stellar population analysis. This allows us to
map mean luminosity-weighted ages, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] in sigma-L-color
space. Our first result is that there are many different red sequences, with
age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] showing different amounts of slope and scatter
when plotted versus sigma, L, or color. These behaviors are explained if the
star formation histories of the galaxies populate a two-dimensional parameter
space. One parameter is the previously well-known increase in age, [Fe/H],
[Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] with sigma. In addition to this, we find systematic
variations at fixed sigma, such that more luminous galaxies are younger, more
Fe-rich, but have lower [Mg/Fe] than their fainter counterparts. The main sigma
trends support a paradigm in which more massive galaxies form their stars more
rapidly and at earlier times than less massive galaxies. The trends at fixed
sigma are consistent with scatter in the duration of star formation for
galaxies at a given sigma. The co-variation of stellar population properties
and L residuals at fixed sigma that we present here has a number of
implications: it explains the differing behavior of stellar population
indicators when investigated versus sigma as compared to L, and it reveals that
L is not as efficient as sigma for indicating galaxy ""size"" in stellar
population studies.

used to derive upper bounds to fault tolerance thresholds - usually by
identifying a privileged resource, such as an entangling gate or a non-Clifford

`unprivileged'. In this work we consider extensions of this approach where
noise is added to Clifford gates too, and then `commuted' around until it
concentrates on attacking the non-Clifford resource. While commuting noise
around is not always straightforward, we find that easy instances can be
identified in popular fault tolerance proposals, thereby enabling sharper upper
bounds to be derived in these cases. For instance we find that if we take
Knill's high threshold proposal together with the ability to prepare any
possible state in the $XY$ plane of the Bloch sphere, then no more than 3.69%
error-per-gate noise is sufficient to make it classical, and 13.71% of Knill's
gamma noise model is sufficient. These bounds have been derived without noise
being added to the decoding parts of the circuits. Introducing such noise in a
toy example suggests that the present approach can be optimised further to
yield tighter bounds.

thermoelectric power (TEP) of monolayer graphene, within the hydrodynamic
regime, taking into account the slow rate of carrier population imbalance
relaxation. Interband electron-hole generation and recombination processes are
inefficient due to the non-decaying nature of the relativistic energy spectrum.
As a result, a population imbalance of the conduction and valence bands is
generically induced upon the application of a thermal gradient. We show that
the thermoelectric response of a graphene monolayer depends upon the ratio of
the sample length to an intrinsic length scale l_Q, set by the imbalance
relaxation rate. At the same time, we incorporate the crucial influence of the
metallic contacts required for the thermopower measurement (under open circuit
boundary conditions), since carrier exchange with the contacts also relaxes the
imbalance. These effects are especially pronounced for clean graphene, where
the thermoelectric transport is limited exclusively by intercarrier collisions.
For specimens shorter than l_Q, the population imbalance extends throughout the
sample; the TC and TEP asymptote toward their zero imbalance relaxation limits.
In the opposite limit of a graphene slab longer than l_Q, at non-zero doping
the TC and TEP approach intrinsic values characteristic of the infinite
imbalance relaxation limit. Samples of intermediate (long) length in the doped
(undoped) case are predicted to exhibit an inhomogeneous temperature profile,
whilst the TC and TEP grow linearly with the system size. In all cases except
for the shortest devices, we develop a picture of bulk electron and hole number
currents that flow between thermally conductive leads, where steady-state
recombination and generation processes relax the accumulating imbalance.

that setting zero the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) parameters will
reproduce it. This is achieved by introducing an additional low energy scale
$M$, together with a physically motivated prescription to take the QED limit.
The prescription is successfully tested in the calculation of the electron
self-energy in the one loop approximation. The LIV radiative corrections turn
out to be properly scaled by very small factors for any reasonable values of
the parameters, no fine-tuning problems are found at this stage and the choice
for $M$ to be of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is
consistent with the stringent bounds for the LIV parameters, in particular with
those arising from induced dimension three operators.

one of the most widely used tools in computational bioscience. All existing
alignment algorithms rely on heuristic scoring schemes based on biological
expertise. Therefore, these algorithms do not provide model independent and
objective measures for how similar two (or more) sequences actually are.
Although information theory provides such a similarity measure -- the mutual
information (MI) -- previous attempts to connect sequence alignment and
information theory have not produced realistic estimates for the MI from a
given alignment.
  Results: Here we describe a simple and flexible approach to get robust
estimates of MI from {\it global} alignments. For mammalian mitochondrial DNA,
our approach gives pairwise MI estimates for commonly used global alignment
algorithms that are strikingly close to estimates obtained by an entirely
unrelated approach -- concatenating and zipping the sequences.
  Conclusions: This remarkable consistency may help establish MI as a reliable
tool for evaluating the quality of global alignments, judging the relative
merits of different alignment algorithms, and estimating the significance of
specific alignments. We expect that our approach can be extended to establish
further connections between information theory and sequence alignment,
including applications to local and multiple alignment procedures.

the Apocalypse of St. John"" (1733). What was not known is that the first
attempts to find that date were made during the early period of his life. The
Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem contains two undated drafts
in Latin under the same title, ""Rules for the Determination of Easter"", grouped
as Yahuda MS 24E. The earlier draft contains multiple references to the
virtually forgotten ""De Annis Christi"" (1649), written by Villum Lange, the
17th century Danish astronomer and theologian, who might have been Newton's
first mentor on the Jewish calendar tradition. The second draft shows not only
Newton's close acquaintance with Maimonides' theory of first lunar visibility,
but also his attempt to simplify the latter's criteria by introducing
different, more practical parameters. These ""astronomical exercises"", announced
in a 1673 book, were likely intended to appear as an appendix to Nicholas
Mercator's 1676 book. Both of Yahuda 24E's drafts contain an astronomical table
with the solar and lunar positions for years 30-37, which Newton used to decide
on the year and date of the Passion. The astronomical data comes from either
1651 ""Harmonicon Coeleste"" or 1669 ""Astronomia Britannica"" by Vincent Wing, a
semi-forgotten astronomer of the seventeenth century. This makes Yahuda 24E one
of the earliest of Newton's drafts, likely written in 1669-73 and certainly not
later than 1683/4. A comparison of the two drafts of Yahuda 24E shows that in
the later one, Newton changed his allegiance from St. John's chronology of the
Passion to that shown in the synoptic gospels.

distributed in the martian atmosphere. However, because the lifetime of CH4 in
the atmosphere of Mars is estimated to be around 300-600 years on the basis of
photochemistry, its release from a subsurface reservoir or an active primary
source of methane have been invoked in the recent literature. Among the
existing scenarios, it has been proposed that clathrate hydrates located in the
near subsurface of Mars could be at the origin of the small quantities of the
detected CH4. Here, we accurately determine the composition of these clathrate
hydrates, as a function of temperature and gas phase composition, by using a
hybrid statistical thermodynamic model based on experimental data. Compared to
other recent works, our model allows us to calculate the composition of
clathrate hydrates formed from a more plausible composition of the martian
atmosphere by considering its main compounds, i.e. carbon dioxyde, nitrogen and
argon, together with methane. Besides, because there is no low temperature
restriction in our model, we are able to determine the composition of clathrate
hydrates formed at temperatures corresponding to the extreme ones measured in
the polar caps. Our results show that methane enriched clathrate hydrates could
be stable in the subsurface of Mars only if a primitive CH4-rich atmosphere has
existed or if a subsurface source of CH4 has been (or is still) present.

feature is a separate cloud of very optically thick molecules within the body
of ionized gas, which is probably the location of the multiple embedded sources
that produce the outflows that define the Orion-S star formation region.
Evidence for this cloud comes from the presence of H2CO lines in absorption in
the radio continuum and discrepancies in the extinction derived from
radio-optical and optical only emission. We present an equilibrium Cloudy model
of the Orion-S cloud, which successfully reproduces many observed properties of
this feature. We also report the discovery of an open-sided shell of [O III]
surrounding the Trapezium stars, revealed through emission line ratio images
and the onset of radiation shadows beyond some proplyds. We show that the
observed properties of the shell are consistent with it being a stationary
structure, produced by shock interactions between the ambient nebular gas and
the high-velocity wind from theta^1 Ori C. We examine the implications of the
recently published evidence for a large blueshifted velocity of theta^1 Ori C
with respect to the Orion Molecular Cloud, which could mean that this star has
only recently begun to photoionize the Orion Nebula. We show that current
observations of the Nebula do not rule out such a possibility, so long as the
ionization front has propagated into a pre-existing low-density region. In
addition, a young age for the Nebula would help explain the presence of nearby
proplyds with a short mass-loss timescale to photoablation.

afterglows of Swift bursts has remained a puzzle since its discovery. The
softening process can also be observed in the later phase of the bursts and its
cause has also been unknown. Recently, it was suggested that, influenced by the
curvature effect, emission from high latitudes would shift the Band function
spectrum from higher energy band to lower band, and this would give rise to the
observed softening process accompanied by a steep decay of the flux density.
The curvature effect scenario predicts that the terminating time of the
softening process would be correlated with the duration of the process. In this
paper, based on the data from the UNLV GRB group web-site, we found an obvious
correlation between the two quantities. In addition, we found that the
softening process can be divided into two classes: the early type softening
($t_{s,max}\leq ""4000""s$) and the late type softening ($t_{s,max} > ""4000""s$).
The two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs.
terminating time plot. In the relation between the variation rates of the flux
density and spectral index during the softening process, a discrepancy between
the two types of softening is also observed. According to their time scales and
the discrepancy between them, we propose that the two types are of different
origins: the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of
external shock origin. The early softening is referred to the steep decay just
following the prompt emission, whereas the late decay typically conceives the
transition from flat decay to late afterglow decay. We suspect that there might
be a great difference of the Lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible
for the observed discrepancy.

This mixing depends on the medium properties, the momentum of the photon and
the background magnetic field. Here we give a general treatment of
pseudoscalar-photon oscillations in a background magnetic field, taking the
Faraday term into account. We give predictions valid in all regimes, under the
assumption that the frequency of the wave is much higher than the plasma
frequency of the medium. At sufficiently high frequencies, the Faraday effect
is negligible and we reproduce the standard pseudoscalar-photon mixing
phenomenon. However at low frequencies, where Faraday effect is important, the

degenerate atomic gases. The main focus is on the equilibrium properties of a
single component atomic Bose gas, which (at least at rest) forms a
Bose-Einstein condensate. Rotation leads to the formation of quantized vortices
which order into a vortex array, in close analogy with the behaviour of
superfluid helium. Under conditions of rapid rotation, when the vortex density
becomes large, atomic Bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics
of quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes. First, there is an
interesting regime in which the vortices become sufficiently dense that their
cores -- as set by the healing length -- start to overlap. In this regime, the
theoretical description simplifies, allowing a reduction to single particle
states in the lowest Landau level. Second, one can envisage entering a regime
of very high vortex density, when the number of vortices becomes comparable to
the number of particles in the gas. In this regime, theory predicts the
appearance of a series of strongly correlated phases, which can be viewed as
{\it bosonic} versions of fractional quantum Hall states. This article
describes the equilibrium properties of rapidly rotating atomic Bose gases in
both the mean-field and the strongly correlated regimes, and related
theoretical developments for Bose gases in lattices, for multi-component Bose
gases, and for atomic Fermi gases. The current experimental situation and
outlook for the future are discussed in the light of these theoretical
developments.

concurrent programming languages. Notably, it has been designed to encompass
both the pi-calculus and the Ambient calculus. This paper is only concerned
with bigraphical syntax: given what we here call a bigraphical signature K,
Milner constructs a (pre-) category of bigraphs BBig(K), whose main features
are (1) the presence of relative pushouts (RPOs), which makes them well-behaved
w.r.t. bisimulations, and that (2) the so-called structural equations become
equalities. Examples of the latter include, e.g., in pi and Ambient, renaming
of bound variables, associativity and commutativity of parallel composition, or
scope extrusion for restricted names. Also, bigraphs follow a scoping
discipline ensuring that, roughly, bound variables never escape their scope.
Here, we reconstruct bigraphs using a standard categorical tool: symmetric
monoidal closed (SMC) theories. Our theory enforces the same scoping discipline
as bigraphs, as a direct property of SMC structure. Furthermore, it elucidates
the slightly mysterious status of so-called links in bigraphs. Finally, our
category is also considerably larger than the category of bigraphs, notably
encompassing in the same framework terms and a flexible form of higher-order
contexts.

fluctuations. Thus rapid variation of wind speed due to changes in the local
meteorological conditions can lead to electrical power variations of the order
of the nominal power output. In small grids, as they exist for example on some
islands in the French West Indies, such fluctuations can cause instabilities in
case of intermediate power shortages. To palliate these difficulties, it is
essential to identify and characterize the wind speed distributions. This
allows to anticipate the eventuality of power shortage or power surge.
Therefore, it is of interest to categorize wind speed fluctuations into
distinct classes and to estimate the probability of a distribution to belong to
a class. This paper presents a method for classifying wind speed histograms by
estimating a finite mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The SAEM algorithm that
we use provides a fine distinction between wind speed distribution classes.
It's a new nonparametric method for wind speed sequences classification.
However, we show that the wind speed distributions in each class correspond to
specific Gram- Charlier densities.

not rely on any image structure beyond the existence of edgels sharing some
common orientations and does not use edge fitting, it is applicable to a wide

understand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance.
  As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was
conducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of
crossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance.
Sixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six
drawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra
eye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have
little impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a
path between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the
path go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view
to further confirmation in future work.

finite temperature of the string-like models are estimated and compared with
the zeta functions. The $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ modular symmetry, being manifest in
the free energies is broken down to the additive symmetry of integers, ${\bf
Z}_{+}$, after interactions are turned on. In the dynamical model existing
behind the zeta function, prepared are the fields labeled by prime numbers. On
the other hand the fields in our models are labeled, not by prime numbers but
by integers. Nevertheless, we can understand whether a number is prime or not
prime by the decay rate, namely by the corresponding particle can decay or can
not decay through interactions conserving energy. Among the models proposed,
the supersymmetric string-like model has the merit of that the zero point

acceleration process. We compute numerically the steady state particle
distributions and escaping photon spectra. These numerical simulations confirm
that synchrotron self-absorption, together with e-e Coulomb collisions,
constitute an efficient thermalising mechanism for the coronal electrons. When
compared to the data, they allow us to constrain the magnetic field and
temperature of the hot protons in the corona independently of any dynamical
accretion flow model or geometry. A preliminary comparison with the Low Hard
State (LHS) spectrum of Cygnus X-1 indicates a magnetic field below
equipartition with radiation, suggesting that the corona is not powered through
magnetic field dissipation (as assumed in most accretion disc corona models).
However, in the LHS of Cygnus X-1 and other sources, our results also point
toward proton temperatures substantially lower than what predicted by the
ADAF-like models. In contrast, in the High Soft State (HSS) both the proton
temperature and magnetic field could be much higher. We also show that in both
spectral states the magnetised corona could be powered essentially through
acceleration of non-thermal particles. The main differences between the LHS and
HSS coronal emission can then be understood as the consequence of the much
stronger radiative cooling in the HSS caused by the soft thermal radiation
coming from the geometrically thin accretion disc.

for the static analysis of XML processing languages. The system relies on a
fixpoint temporal logic with converse, derived from the mu-calculus, where
models are finite trees. This calculus is expressive enough to capture regular
tree types along with multi-directional navigation in trees, while having a
single exponential time complexity. Specifically the decidability of the logic
is proved in time 2^O(n) where n is the size of the input formula.
  Major XML concepts are linearly translated into the logic: XPath navigation
and node selection semantics, and regular tree languages (which include DTDs
and XML Schemas). Based on these embeddings, several problems of major
importance in XML applications are reduced to satisfiability of the logic.
These problems include XPath containment, emptiness, equivalence, overlap,
coverage, in the presence or absence of regular tree type constraints, and the
static type-checking of an annotated query.
  The focus is then given to a sound and complete algorithm for deciding the
logic, along with a detailed complexity analysis, and crucial implementation
techniques for building an effective solver. Practical experiments using a full

the insensitivity to chiral symmetry breaking. As has recently been understood,
this leads to doubling between two hadrons of equal spin and opposite parity.
As a novelty we show that three-quark, for example Delta states, group into
quartets with two states of each parity, all four states having equal angular
momentum J. Diagonalizing the chiral charge expressed in terms of quarks we
show that the quartet is slightly split into two parity doublets by the tensor
force, all splittings decreasing to zero high in the spectrum. Our specific

A Boltzmann type equation describing the transport of heat was obtained. In
this paper, we show numerically that the Boltzmann description obtained in

also study the heat transport of the model when the scattering probability is
one, corresponding to deterministic dynamics. At a coarse grained level the

We show that this system size dependence is due to a core-corona effect: the

multiplicity differs from that of a core nucleon. $\phi$ mesons follow in

synchrony, arguably the simplest non-trivial collective dynamics in such
networks. We find that even this simplest dynamical problem -- local stability
of synchrony -- is non-trivial to solve and requires novel methods for its
solution. The dynamics in the vicinity of the synchronous state is determined
by a multitude of linear operators, in contrast to a single stability matrix in
conventional linear stability theory. This unusual property qualitatively
depends on network topology and may be neglected for globally coupled
homogeneous networks. For generic networks, however, the number of operators
increases exponentially with the size of the network. We present methods to
treat this multi-operator problem exactly. First, based on the Gershgorin and
Perron-Frobenius theorems, we derive bounds on the eigenvalues that provide
important information about the synchronization process but are not sufficient
to establish the asymptotic stability or instability of the synchronous state.
We then present a complete analysis of asymptotic stability for topologically
strongly connected networks using simple graph-theoretical considerations. For
inhibitory interactions between dissipative (leaky) oscillatory neurons the
synchronous state is stable, independent of the parameters and the network
connectivity. These results indicate that pulse-like interactions play a
profound role in network dynamical systems, and in particular in the dynamics
of biological synchronization, unless the coupling is homogeneous and
all-to-all.

developed the electromagnetic field is quantized by a proper choice of a

guided and radiative (partially and fully) states. In particular, by choosing a
set of radiative states characterized by a single outgoing component, we get
rid of the problem related to the quantum interference between different
outgoing modes, which arises when the standard radiative basis is used to
calculate spontaneous emission patterns. After the derivation of the local
density of states, the analytical expressions for the emission rates are
obtained within the framework of perturbation theory. First we apply our model
to realistic Silicon-based structures such as a single Silicon/air interface
and a Silicon waveguide in both the symmetric and asymmetric configurations.

Kinetic parameters were obtained through a combination of direct analysis of

performed whereby the pores were blocked by pre-exposure of the SiO2 to water

previous studies, with the SiO2 having little impact on the desorption beyond

capacities, and that below such a temperature sympathetic cooling vanishes.
When the effect of partial overlap is taken into account, optimal sympathetic
cooing of the Fermi species may be achieved by properly tuning the relative
trapping strength of the two species in a time-dependent fashion.
Alternatively, the dimensionality of the trap in the final stage of cooling can
be changed by increasing the confinement strength, which also results in a
crossover of the heat capacities at deeper Fermi degeneracies. This technique
may be extended to Fermi-Bose degenerate mixtures in optical lattices.

to two photons by using the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) setup. Whereas we
previously have reported results from CAST with evacuated magnet bores (Phase
I), setting limits on lower mass axions, here we report results from CAST where
the magnet bores were filled with \hefour gas (Phase II) of variable pressure.
The introduction of gas generated a refractive photon mass $m_\gamma$, thereby
achieving the maximum possible conversion rate for those axion masses \ma that
match $m_\gamma$. With 160 different pressure settings we have scanned \ma up
to about 0.4 eV, taking approximately 2 h of data for each setting. From the
absence of excess X-rays when the magnet was pointing to the Sun, we set a
typical upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of $\gag\lesssim 2.17\times
10^{-10} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ at 95% CL for $\ma \lesssim 0.4$ eV, the exact result
depending on the pressure setting. The excluded parameter range covers
realistic axion models with a Peccei-Quinn scale in the neighborhood of $f_{\rm
a}\sim10^{7}$ GeV. Currently in the second part of CAST Phase II, we are
searching for axions with masses up to about 1.2 eV using \hethree as a buffer
gas.

there is a significant detection even during the superior conjunction of the
compact object, when very large gamma-ray opacities are expected.
Electromagnetic cascades, which may make the system more transparent to
gamma-rays, are hardly efficient for reasonable magnetic fields in the massive
star surroundings. A jet-like flow could transport energy to regions where the
photon-photon absorption is much lower and the TeV radiation is not so severely
absorbed. Otherwise, in the standard pulsar scenario for LS 5039, the emitter
would be located between the star and the compact object, which would imply the
violation of the observational constraints at X-rays.
