quantum compared to classical computation, and that one needs a sufficient
amount of entanglement for this speedup to be manifest. In measurement-based
quantum computing (MBQC), the need for a highly entangled initial state is
particularly obvious. Defying this intuition, we show that quantum states can
be too entangled to be useful for the purpose of computation. We prove that
this phenomenon occurs for a dramatic majority of all states: the fraction of
useful n-qubit pure states is less than exp(-n^2). Computational universality
is hence a rare property in quantum states. This work highlights a new aspect
of the question concerning the role entanglement plays for quantum
computational speed-ups. The statements remain true if one allows for certain
forms of post-selection and also cover the notion of CQ-universality. We
identify scale-invariant states resulting from a MERA construction as likely
candidates for physically relevant states subject to this effect.

stellar deaths,ranging from ordinary SNe to relativistic hypernovae associated
with long duration GRBs, is under intense debate. In this context, SN2008D
associated with XT080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it might
exemplify a potential borderline event. The main aim is to infer geometric
information of SN2008D through the evolution of its linear optical
polarization. We also report the polarization evolution of SN2007uy, and
discuss the properties of the host ISM towards the XT. The final goal is to
compare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both SNe,
which shone contemporaneously in NGC2770. This fortunate coincidence brought us
the opportunity to observe both SNe simultaneously, and most importantly, with
identical instrumental setups. The observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6
days after the XT and are distributed in 11 visits. In addition we performed
observations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. We
report positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for SN2008D at
a level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for SN2007uy. SN2007uy shows constant polarization,
which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constant
eccentricity expansion on the sky plane. A statistical analysis of the
distribution of the SN2008D Stokes parametres suggests that it could show an
intrinsic variable polarization component. Assuming the SN2007uy polarization
is constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic SN2008D polarization
could be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variable
eccentricity. We come to the same result even if we make no assumption on
SN2007uy, although at a lower significance level. We suggest that at least the
projected, if not the intrinsic, geometries of both SNe could differ.

weakly interacting gas of bosons confined in an optical lattice in the
tight-binding limit. This is accomplished by adding a linear potential to a
suitably prepared lattice, and allowing the gas to evolve under the influence
of the total potential. After a prescribed time, a spectral transform is
effected where each (highly non-local) energy state is transformed into a
distinct site of the lattice, thus allowing the energy distribution to be
(non-destructively) imaged in real space. Evolving for twice the time returns
the atoms to their initial state. The results suggest efficient methods to both
measure the temperature in situ, as well as to cool atoms within the lattice:
after applying the spectral transform one simply needs to remove atoms from all

dimensions, based on published and pending literature. Eliashberg's
characterization of manifolds admitting Stein structures requires an extra
delicate hypothesis in complex dimension 2, which can be eliminated by passing
to the topological setting and invoking Freedman theory. The situation is quite
similar if one asks which open subsets of a fixed complex manifold can be made
Stein by an isotopy. As an application of these theorems, one can construct
uncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic R^4's realized as Stein open
subsets of C^2 (i.e. domains of holomorphy). More generally, every domain of
holomorphy in C^2 is topologically isotopic to other such domains realizing
uncountably many diffeomorphism types. Any tame n-complex in a complex
n-manifold can be isotoped to become a nested intersection of Stein open
subsets, provided the isotopy is topological when n=2. In the latter case, the
Stein neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but frequently realize uncountably many
diffeomorphism types. It is also proved that every exhausting Morse function
can be subdivided to yield a locally finite handlebody of the same maximal
index, both in the context of smooth n-manifolds and for Stein surfaces.

relationships between general relativity and quantum physics. However, some
subtle aspects of gravitating quantum systems might be difficult to ascertain
using static backgrounds, since quantum mechanics incorporates dynamic
measurability constraints (such as the uncertainty principle, etc.).
  For this reason, the behaviors of quantum systems on a dynamic black hole
background are explored in this paper. The velocities and trajectories of
representative outgoing, ingoing, and stationary classical particles are
calculated and contrasted, and the dynamics of simple quantum fields (both
massless and massive) on the space-time are examined. Invariant densities
associated with the quantum fields are exhibited on the Penrose diagram that
represents the excreting black hole.
  Furthermore, a generic approach for the consistent mutual gravitation of
quanta in a manner that reproduces the given geometry is developed. The
dynamics of the mutually gravitating quantum fields are expressed in terms of
the affine parameter that describes local motions of a given quantum type on
the space-time. Algebraic equations that relate the energy-momentum densities
of the quantum fields to Einstein's tensor can then be developed. An example
mutually gravitating system of macroscopically coherent quanta along with a
core gravitating field is demonstrated. Since the approach is generic and
algebraic, it can be used to represent a variety of systems with specified
boundary conditions.

In practice these effects are small for the physics of flavor non-singlet
particles. However large uncontrolled systematic errors are expected for flavor
singlet issues, such as the mass of the eta prime meson. While the relative
speed of the algorithm in large scale simulations may justify its use, the
method is an approximation and should not be promoted as a first principles

driven by the advent of digital synoptic sky surveys. While panoramic surveys
can detect variable or transient events, typically some follow-up observations
are needed; for short-lived phenomena, a rapid response is essential. Ability
to automatically classify and prioritize transient events for follow-up studies
becomes critical as the data rates increase. We have been developing such
methods using the data streams from the Palomar-Quest survey, the Catalina Sky
Survey and others, using the VOEventNet framework. The goal is to automatically
classify transient events, using the new measurements, combined with archival
data (previous and multi-wavelength measurements), and contextual information
(e.g., Galactic or ecliptic latitude, presence of a possible host galaxy
nearby, etc.); and to iterate them dynamically as the follow-up data come in
(e.g., light curves or colors). We have been investigating Bayesian
methodologies for classification, as well as discriminated follow-up to
optimize the use of available resources, including Naive Bayesian approach, and
the non-parametric Gaussian process regression. We will also be deploying
variants of the traditional machine learning techniques such as Neural Nets and
Support Vector Machines on datasets of reliably classified transients as they
build up.

interfaces (1.6-fold), but only in early closure. Furthermore, closure is
marked by a decrease in the recoil power-law exponent - implying a transition

theoretical community, the Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics
(CCAPP) at The Ohio State University (OSU) organized a 3-day DUSEL Theory

scientific case for six proposed experiments for DUSEL: long baseline neutrino
oscillations, proton decay, dark matter, astrophysical neutrinos, neutrinoless
double beta decay and N-Nbar oscillations.
  The outcome of this workshop is the DUSEL Theory White paper addressing the

generally observed as a `spike' in their flux profile. Here, in this paper, we
present an analysis of electron and whistler wave properties for a
quasi-perpendicular shock crossing that is supercritical, but subcritical to
the so-called whistler critical Mach number, M$^w_{\rm crit}$, above which
whistler waves cannot propagate upstream. We have found that the amplitudes of
whistler waves increased exponentially as a function of time prior to the shock
encounter, while the suprathermal ($>$ 2 keV) electron flux similarly increased
with time, although with differing $e$-folding time scales. Comparison of the
electron energy spectrum measured within the ramp with predictions from
diffusive shock acceleration theory was poor, but the variation of pitch angle
distribution showed scattering of non-thermal electrons in the upstream region.
While not finding a specific mechanism to account for the electron diffusion,
we suggest that the whistlers seen probably account for the differences
observed between this `gradual' event and the `spike' events seen at shocks
with no upstream whistlers.

the interplay between interaction and on-site disorder affects spatial
localization and quantum correlations. The hopping amplitude is kept constant.
To measure localization, we use the number of principal components (NPC), which
quantifies the spreading of the system eigenstates over vectors of a given
basis set. Quantum correlations are determined by a global entanglement measure
$Q$, which quantifies the degree of entanglement of multipartite pure states.
Our studies apply analogously to a one-dimensional system of interacting
spinless fermions, hard-core bosons, or yet to an XXZ Heisenberg spin-1/2
chain. Disorder is characterized by both: uncorrelated and long-range
correlated random on-site energies. Dilute and half-filled chains are analyzed.
In half-filled clean chains, delocalization is maximum when the particles do
not interact, whereas multi-partite entanglement is largest when they do. In
the presence of uncorrelated disorder, NPC and Q show a non-trivial behavior
with interaction, peaking in the chaotic region. The inclusion of correlated
disorder may further extend two-particle states, but the effect decreases with
the number of particles and strength of their interactions. In half-filled
chains with large interaction, correlated disorder may even enhance
localization.

rather a featureless disk extending from within a few arcsec of the star across
the ring to r ~ 34 arcsec (110 AU). The spectral energy distribution (SED) of

is primarily from large (a ~ 135 um) grains, with smaller (a ~ 15 um) grains
also present in and beyond the ring. The Spitzer IRS and MIPS SED-mode
spectrophotometry data clearly show the presence of spatially compact excess
emission at lambda > 15 um that requires the presence of two additional narrow
belts of dust within the sub-mm ring's central void. The innermost belt at r ~
3 AU is composed of silicate dust. A simple dynamical model suggests that dust
produced collisionally by a population of about 11 M_Earth of planetesimals in
the sub-mm ring could be the source of the emission from both in and beyond the

the circumstellar material on small spatial scales. Many models relate the
circumstellar environment to observable polarization changes across spectral
lines. However, measuring signals at the 0.1% level requires a very careful
control of systematic effects.
  We have recently built a high-resolution spectropolarimeter for the HiVIS
spectrograph on the 3.67m AEOS telescope and have obtained a large number of
high precision spectropolarimetric observations of Herbig Ae/Be, Classical Be
and other stars. The detected linear polarization varies from our typical
detection threshold near 0.1% up to 2%. This polarization effect is generally
not coincident with the H-alpha emission peak but is detected only in the
absorptive part of the line profile and varies with the absorption. These
detections are largely inconsistent with the traditional scattering models and
inspired a new explanation of their polarization.
  We developed a new spectropolarimetric model and argue that polarization in
absorption is evidence of optical pumping. We argue that, while scattering
theory fits many Be and emission-line star observations, this new theory has
much more potential to explain polarization-in-absorption as seen in Herbig
Ae/Be and other stellar systems.
  This thesis presents a large spectropolarimetric study that combines new
instrumentation, custom processing software, thorough calibrations,
cross-instrument comparisons, a massive observing campaign on many targets,
comparison of current theories on multiple objects and finally the creation of
a new theory.

NGC 663. It contains the slowest X-ray pulsar known with a pulse period of
around 1400s and, primarily from the study of variation in the emission line
profile of H alpha, it is known to have a Be decretion disk with a one-armed
density wave period of approximately 1240d. Here we present the results of an
extensive photometric campaign, supplemented with optical spectroscopy, aimed
at measuring short time-scale periodicities. We find three significant
periodicities in the photometric data at, in order of statistical significance,
0.34d, 0.67d and 0.10d. We give arguments to support the interpretation that
the 0.34d and 0.10d periods could be due to stellar oscillations of the B type
primary star and that the 0.67d period is the spin period of the Be star with a
spin axis inclination of 23 +10 -8 degrees. We measured a systemic velocity of
-37.0 +- 4.3 km/s confirming that LS I+61 235 has a high probability of
membership in the young cluster NGC 663 from which the system's age can be
estimated as 20-25 Myr. From archival RXTE ASM data we further find ""super""
X-ray outbursts roughly every 450d. If these super outbursts are caused by the
alignment of the compact star with the one-armed decretion disk enhancement,
then the orbital period is approximately 330d.

non-thermal comptonisation in the corona). We present numerical simulations
using a new code accounting for the so-called synchrotron boiler effect. These
numerical simulations when compared to the data allow us to constrain the
magnetic field and temperature of the hot protons in the corona. For the hard
state of Cygnus X-1 we find a magnetic field below equipartition with
radiation, suggesting that the corona is not powered through magnetic field
dissipation (as assumed in most accretion disc corona models). On the other
hand, our results also point toward proton temperatures that are substantially
lower than typical temperatures of the ADAF models. Finally, we show that in
both spectral states Comptonising plasma could be powered essentially through
power-law acceleration of non-thermal electrons, which are then partly
thermalised by the synchrotron and Coulomb boiler. This suggests that, contrary
to current beliefs, the corona of the HSS and that of the LHS could be of very
similar nature. The differences between the LHS and HSS coronal spectra would
then be predominantly caused by the strong disc soft cooling emission which is
present in the HSS and absent in the LHS.

self-organization phenomena resulting from the interactions of many
pedestrians, which may improve or obstruct their flow. Besides formation of
lanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate
densities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)] and a phenomenon called ""crowd
turbulence"" can occur at high pedestrian densities [D. Helbing et al., Phys.
Rev. E 75, 046109 (2007)]. Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under
extreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or
egress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation,
there is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this
paper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable
video data. This is illustrated at the example of pilgrim flows entering the
previous Jamarat Bridge in Mina, 5 kilometers from the Holy Mosque in Makkah,
Saudi-Arabia. Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation
phenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even
at local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density
and flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has
implications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for
mass events. When conditions become congested, the flow drops significantly,
which can cause stop-and-go waves and a further increase of the density until
critical crowd conditions are reached. Then, ""crowd turbulence"" sets in, which
may trigger crowd disasters.

ultra-subwavelength waveguides.

cuprates to the spin ordering is used to clarify the doping-induced
transformation from an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator to a superconducting
(SC) metal in RBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} (R = Lu, Y) single crystals. The established
phase diagram demonstrates that the AF and SC regions apparently overlap: the
superconductivity in RBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}, in contrast to La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4, sets
in before the long-range AF order is completely destroyed by hole doping.
Magnetoresistance measurements of superconducting crystals with low T_c<15-20 K
give a clear view of the magnetic-field induced superconductivity suppression
and recovery of the long-range AF state. What still remains to be understood is
whether the AF order actually persists in the SC state or just revives when the
superconductivity is suppressed, and, in the former case, whether the
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity reside in nanoscopically separated
phases or coexist on an atomic scale.

the performance of the numerical techniques employed for the study of
supersonic turbulence. We aim at characterising the performance of different
particle-based and grid-based techniques on the modelling of decaying
supersonic turbulence. Four different grid codes (ENZO, FLASH, TVD, ZEUS) and
three different SPH codes (GADGET, PHANTOM, VINE) are compared. We additionally
analysed two calculations denoted as PHANTOM A and PHANTOM B using two
different implementations of artificial viscosity. Our analysis indicates that
grid codes tend to be less dissipative than SPH codes, though details of the
techniques used can make large differences in both cases. For example, the
Morris & Monaghan viscosity implementation for SPH results in less dissipation
(PHANTOM B and VINE versus GADGET and PHANTOM A). For grid codes, using a
smaller diffusion parameter leads to less dissipation, but results in a larger
bottleneck effect (our ENZO versus FLASH runs). As a general result, we find
that by using a similar number of resolution elements N for each spatial
direction means that all codes (both grid-based and particle-based) show
encouraging similarity of all statistical quantities for isotropic supersonic
turbulence on spatial scales k<N/32 (all scales resolved by more than 32 grid
cells), while scales smaller than that are significantly affected by the
specific implementation of the algorithm for solving the equations of
hydrodynamics. At comparable numerical resolution, the SPH runs were on average
about ten times more computationally intensive than the grid runs, although
with variations of up to a factor of ten between the different SPH runs and
between the different grid runs. (abridged)

supercell calculations with explicit F substitution are compared with those
obtained from the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) and from a simple rigid
band shift. We find significant differences between the supercell results and
those obtained from the rigid-band shift with electron doping, although quite
remarkably the supercell results are in good agreement with the virtual crystal
approximation (VCA) where the nuclear charges of the O atoms are slightly
increased to mimic the addition of the extra electrons. With electron doping,
the two cylindrical hole pockets along $\Gamma-Z$ shrink in size, and the third
hole pocket around $Z$ disappears for an electron doping concentration in
excess of about 7-8%, while the two elliptical electron cylinders along $M-A$
expand in size. The spin-orbit coupling does not affect the Fermi surface much
except to somewhat reduce the size of the third hole pocket in the undoped
case. We find that with the addition of the electrons the antiferromagnetic
state becomes energetically less stable as compared to the nonmagnetic state,
indicating that the electron doping may provide an extra degree of stability to
the formation of the superconducting ground state.

the ergodic averages of the transition probability function and its local
uniform continuity. The latter is called the e-property. The general result is

derive the law of large numbers for the trajectory of a tracer.
