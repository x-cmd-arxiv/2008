involving neutrinos (applying equally well to neutral mesons) that takes
entanglement into account. Thereby we present a theoretically sound proof of
the universal validity of the oscillation formulae ordinarily used. In so
doing, we show that the departures from exponential decay reported by the GSI

quasar Q0957+561. New gr light curves permit us to detect significant intrinsic
fluctuations, to determine new time delays, and thus to gain perspective on the
mechanism of intrinsic variability in Q0957+561. We use new optical frames of
Q0957+561 in the g and r passbands from January 2005 to July 2007. These frames
are part of an ongoing long-term monitoring with the Liverpool robotic
telescope. We also introduce two photometric pipelines that are applied to the
new gr frames of Q0957+561. The transformation pipeline incorporates
zero-point, colour, and inhomogeneity corrections to the instrumental
magnitudes, so final photometry to the 1-2% level is achieved for both quasar
components. The two-colour final records are then used to measure time delays.
The gr light curves of Q0957+561 show several prominent events and gradients,
and some of them (in the g band) lead to a time delay between components of 417
+/- 2 d (1 sigma). We do not find evidence of extrinsic variability in the
light curves of Q0957+561. We also explore the possibility of a delay between a
large event in the g band and the corresponding event in the r band. The gr
cross-correlation reveals a time lag of 4.0 +/- 2.0 d (1 sigma; the g-band
event is leading) that confirms a previous claim of the existence of a delay
between the g and r band in this lensed quasar. The time delays (between quasar
components and between optical bands) from the new records and previous ones in
similar bands indicate that most observed variations in Q0957+561 (amplitudes
of about 100 mmag and timescales of about 100 d) are very probably due to
reverberation within the gas disc around the supermassive black hole.

old metal-poor population that is very commonly found around normal galaxies.
However, all galaxies except PGC 10922 contain several globular clusters that
are significantly brighter than the maximum luminosity expected of a single old

of an old metal-poor subpopulation with a range of plausible specific
frequencies and an intermediate-age subpopulation of solar metallicity. We find
that three of the four sample galaxies show evidence for the presence of an
intermediate-age (~ 1 Gyr) globular cluster population, in addition to the old
metal-poor GC population seen in normal early-type galaxies. None of the

functions of the quasar luminosity at restframe wavelengths of 2100 and 2600
\AA. Old optical records also allow the structure function to be obtained at
2100 \AA, but 10 years ago in the observer's frame. These three structure
functions are then compared to predictions of both simple and relatively
sophisticated (incorporating two independent variable components) Poissonian
models. We do not find clear evidence of a chromatic mechanism of variability.
  From the recent data, 100-d time-symmetric and 170-d time-asymmetric flares
are produced at both restframe wavelengths. Taking into account measurements of
time delays and the existence of an EUV/radio jet, reverberation is probably
the main mechanism of variability. Thus, two types of EUV/X-ray fluctuations
would be generated within or close to the jet and later reprocessed by the disc
gas in the two emission rings. The 100-d time-symmetric shots are also
responsible for most of the 2100 \AA variability detected in the old
experiment. However, there is no evidence of asymmetric shots in the old UV
variability. If reverberation is the involved mechanism of variability, this
could mean an intermittent production of high-energy asymmetric fluctuations.
The old records are also consistent with the presence of very short-lifetime
(10 d) symmetric flares, which may represent additional evidence of time
evolution. We also discuss the quasar structure that emerges from the
variability scenario.

lattice electron operators we derive a full Ising version of the t-J model.
This model possesses the global discrete Z_2 symmetry as a maximal spin
symmetry of the Hamiltonian at any values of the coupling constants, t and J.
In contrast, in the spin anisotropic limit of the t-J model, usually referred
to as the t-J_z model, the global SU(2) invariance is fully restored at J_z=0,
so that only the spin-spin interaction has in that model the true Ising form.
We discuss a relationship between those two models and the standard isotropic
t-J model. We show that the low-energy quasiparticles in all three models share
the qualitatively similar properties at low doping and small values of J/t. The
main advantage of the proposed Ising t-J model over the t-J_z one is that the
former allows for the unbiased Monte Carlo calculations on large clusters of up
to 10^3 sites. Within this model we discuss in detail the destruction of the
antiferromagnetic order by doping as well as the interplay between the AF order
and hole mobility. We also discuss the effect of the exchange interaction and
that of the next nearest neighbour hoppings on the destruction of the AF order
at finite doping. We show that the short-range AF order is observed in a wide
range of temperatures and dopings, much beyond the boundaries of the AF phase.
We explicitly demonstrate that the local no double occupancy constraint plays
the dominant role in destroying the magnetic order at finite doping. Finally, a
role of inhomogeneities is discussed.

self-energy, Pauli blocking and Bose enhancement. Similar to the single-baryon
states (free neutrons and protons), the light elements ($2 \le A \le 4$,
internal quantum state $\nu$) are treated as quasiparticles with energies
$E_{A,\nu}(\vec P; T, n_n,n_p)$. These energies depend on the center of mass

that $n_n, n_p$ (or the corresponding chemical potentials $\mu_n, \mu_p$) are
fixed independently.
  For the single nucleon quasiparticle energy shift, different approximate
expressions such as Skyrme or relativistic mean field approaches are well
known. Treating the $A$-particle problem in appropriate approximations, results
for the cluster quasiparticle shifts are given. Properties of dense nuclear
matter at moderate temperatures in the subsaturation density region considered
here are influenced by the composition. This in turn is determined by the
cluster quasiparticle energies, in particular the formation of clusters at low
densities when the temperature decreases, and their dissolution due to Pauli
blocking as the density increases. Our finite-temperature Green function
approach covers different limiting cases: The low-density region where the
model of nuclear statistical equilibrium and virial expansions can be applied,

fronts to merger activity, understanding the dynamics of mergers and their
effect on the cluster constituents. The Chandra X-ray imagery of Abell 1201
reveals two conspicuous surface brightness discontinuities, which are shown to
be cold fronts, and a remnant core structure. Temperature maps reveal a complex
multi-phase temperature structure with regions of hot gas interspersed with
fingers of cold gas. Our optical analysis is based on a sample of 321 confirmed
members, whose mean redshift is z=0.1673 +/- 0.0002 and velocity dispersion is
778 +/- 36 km/s. We search for dynamical substructure and find clear evidence
for multiple localized velocity substructures coincident with over-densities in
the galaxy surface density. Most notably, we find structure coincident with the
remnant X-ray core. Despite the clear evidence for dynamical activity, we find
the peculiar velocity distribution does not deviate significantly from
Gaussian. We apply two-body dynamical analyses in order to assess which of the
substructures are bound, and thus dynamically important in terms of the cluster
merger history. We propose that the cold fronts in Abell 1201 are a consequence
of its merger with a smaller subunit, which has induced gas motions that gave
rise to `sloshing' cold fronts. Abell 1201 illustrates the value of combining
multi-wavelength data and multiple substructure detection techniques when

Coverage and volume of the nanobubbles enhance with increasing voltage. The
yield of hydrogen nanobubbles is much larger than the yield of oxygen
nanobubbles. The growth of the individual nanobubbles during the electrolysis
process is recorded in time with the help of AFM measurements and correlated
with the total current. Both the size of the individual nanobubbles and the
total current saturate after typical 1 minute; then the nanobubbles are in a
dynamic equilibrium, meaning that they do not further grow, in spite of ongoing
gas production and nonzero current. The surface area of nanobubbles shows a
good correlation with the nanobubble volume growth rate, suggesting that either
the electrolytic gas emerges directly at the nanobubbles' surface, or it
emerges at the electrode's surface and then diffuses through the nanobubbles'
surface. Moreover, the experiments reveal that the time constants of the

indexability and obtain Whittle's index in closed-form for both discounted and
average reward criteria. These results lead to a direct implementation of
Whittle's index policy with remarkably low complexity. When these Markov chains
are stochastically identical, we show that Whittle's index policy is optimal
under certain conditions. Furthermore, it has a semi-universal structure that
obviates the need to know the Markov transition probabilities. The optimality
and the semi-universal structure result from the equivalency between Whittle's
index policy and the myopic policy established in this work. For non-identical
channels, we develop efficient algorithms for computing a performance upper
bound given by Lagrangian relaxation. The tightness of the upper bound and the
near-optimal performance of Whittle's index policy are illustrated with
simulation examples.

consist of a set of coupled equations describing a spin-1/2 field, $\Psi$,

equations and a metric, $g_{\mu\nu}$, which satisfies the Einstein field

$\Psi$, $A_\mu$ and $g_{\mu\nu}$ are each identified as derived quantities from
the field displacements of ordinary elasticity theory. By quantizing the
elastic field displacements, a quantization of all of the derived fields are
obtained even though they do not explicitly appear in the Lagrangian. We
demonstrate the approach in a three dimensional setting where explicit
solutions of the Dirac field in terms of fractional derivatives are obtained. A
higher dimensional version of the theory would provide an alternate approach to

mobile branes with other branes or orbifold planes occur and lead to
interesting cosmological signatures. The fundamental M/string-theory
description of these collisions is still lacking but it is clear that the
inflaton looses part of its energy to some form of brane matter, e.g. a
component of tensionless strings. In the absence of a fundamental description,
we assume a general barotropic fluid on the brane, which absorbs part of the
inflaton's energy. The fluid is modeled by a scalar with a suitable exponential
potential to arrive at a full-fledged field theory model. We study numerically
the impact of the energy transfer from the inflaton to the scalar on curvature
and isocurvature perturbations and demonstrate explicitly that the curvature
power spectrum gets modulated by oscillations which damp away toward smaller
scales. Even though, the contribution of isocurvature perturbations decays
toward the end of inflation, they induce curvature perturbations on scales that
exit the horizon before the collision. We consider cases where the scalar
behaves like radiation, matter or a web of cosmic strings and discuss the
differences in the resulting power spectra.

the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric
accuracy of 300 microarcsecond, and by investigating in detail the individual
systematic error contributions. The combination of a long time baseline and the
excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allow us to determine
orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full
revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits
are fit extremely well by a single point mass potential to within the
astrometric uncertainties, which are now 6 times better than in previous
studies. The central object mass is (4.31 +- 0.06|stat +- 0.36|R0) * 10^6 M_sun
where the fractional statistical error of 1.5 percent is nearly independent
from R0 and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R0. Our current
best estimate for the distance to the Galactic Center is R0 = 8.33 +- 0.35 kpc.
The dominant errors in this value is systematic. The mass scales with distance
as (3.95 +- 0.06) * 10^6 M_sun * (R0/8kpc)^2.19. The orientations of orbital
angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six
of the stars with orbital solutions as late type stars, and six early-type
stars as members of the clockwise rotating disk system, as was previously
proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter

is defined unambiguously through the bounce. We also analyze the evolution of

interaction and cooperation of sperm embedded in a two-dimensional fluid by
using a particle-based mesoscopic simulation method, multi-particle collision
dynamics (MPC). We analyze the sperm behavior by investigating the relationship
between the beating-phase difference and the relative sperm position, as well
as the energy consumption. Two effects of hydrodynamic interaction are found,
synchronization and attraction. With these hydrodynamic effects, a multi-sperm
system shows swarm behavior with a power-law dependence of the average cluster
size on the width of the distribution of beating frequencies.

using TEMPOL and TEMPO as the probes. The spin probe signature of the water
freezing has been described in terms of the collapse of narrow triplet spectrum
into a single broad line. This spin probe signature of freezing has been
observed at an anomalously low temperature when a milimoler solution of TEMPOL
is slowly cooled from room temperature. A systematic observation has revealed a
spin probe concentration dependence of these freezing and respective melting
points. These results can be explained in terms of localization of spin probe
and liquid water, most probably in the interstices of ice grains, in an ice
matrix. The lowering of spin probe freezing point, along with the secondary
evidences, like spin probe concentration dependence of peak-to-peak width in
frozen limit signal, indicates a possible size dependence of these
localizations/entrapments with spin probe concentration. A weak concentration
dependence of spin probe assisted freezing and melting points, which has been
observed for TEMPO in comparison to TEMPOL, indicates different natures of
interactions with water of these two probes. This view is also supported by the
relaxation behavior of the two probes.

correlations exhibit two types of oscillatory behaviour in the endemic phase.
In a large parameter range, the oscillations are due to resonant amplification
of stochastic fluctuations, a general mechanism first reported for
predator-prey dynamics. In a narrow range of parameters that includes many
infectious diseases which confer long lasting immunity the oscillations persist
for infinite populations. This effect is apparent in simulations of the
stochastic process in systems of variable size, and can be understood from the
phase diagram of the deterministic pair approximation equations. The two
mechanisms combined play a central role in explaining the ubiquity of
oscillatory behaviour in real data and in simulation results of epidemic and
other related models.

One
of the main sources of wave energy dissipation lies in boundary layers. The
present work is entirely devoted to thorough analysis of the dispersion
relation of the novel visco-potential formulation. Namely, in this study we
relax all assumptions of the weak dependence of the wave frequency on time. As
a result, we have to deal with complex integro-differential equations that
describe transient behaviour of the phase and group velocities. Using numerical
computations, we show several snapshots of these important quantities at
different times as functions of the wave number. Good qualitative agreement
with previous study [Dutykh2009] is obtained. Thus, we validate in some sense
approximations made anteriorly. There is an unexpected conclusion of this
study. According to our computations, the bottom boundary layer creates
disintegrating modes in the group velocity. In the same time, the imaginary
part of the phase velocity remains negative for all times. This result can be
interpreted as a new kind of instability which is induced by the bottom
boundary layer effect.
