consists of non-resonant, growing plasma waves driven by the electric current
of cosmic rays (CRs) that stream along the magnetic field ahead of both
relativistic and non-relativistic shocks. Combining an analytic, kinetic model
with one-, two-, and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we confirm
the existence of this instability in the kinetic regime and determine its
saturation mechanisms. In the linear regime, we show that, if the background
plasma is well magnetized, the CRCD waves grow exponentially at the rates and
wavelengths predicted by the analytic dispersion relation. The magnetization
condition implies that the growth rate of the instability is much smaller than
the ion cyclotron frequency. As the instability becomes non-linear, significant
turbulence forms in the plasma. This turbulence reduces the growth rate of the
field and damps the shortest wavelength modes, making the dominant wavelength,
\lambda_d, grow proportional to the square of the field. At constant CR
current, we find that plasma acceleration along the motion of CRs saturates the
instability at the magnetic field level such that v_A ~ v_{d,cr}, where v_A is
the Alfven velocity in the amplified field, and v_{d,cr} is the drift velocity
of CRs. The instability can also saturate earlier if CRs get strongly deflected
by the amplified field, which happens when their Larmor radii get close to
\lambda_d. We apply these results to the case of CRs in the upstream medium of
supernova remnants. Considering only the most energetic CRs that escape from
the shock, we obtain that the field amplification factor of ~10 can be reached.
This confirms the CRCD instability as a potentially important component of
magnetic amplification process in astrophysical shocks.

One of the key science goals is fast follow-up of the enigmatic and short lived

demands: (1) During normal observations, the 72-ton telescope has to be
positioned accurately, and has to track a given sky position with high
precision at a typical rotational speed in the order of one revolution per day.
(2) For successfully observing GRB prompt emission and afterglows, it has to be
powerful enough to position to an arbitrary point on the sky within a few ten
seconds and commence normal tracking immediately thereafter. To meet these
requirements, the implementation and realization of the drive system relies
strongly on standard industry components to ensure robustness and reliability.
In this paper, we describe the mechanical setup, the drive control and the
calibration of the pointing, as well as present measurements of the accuracy of
the system. We show that the drive system is mechanically able to operate the
motors with an accuracy even better than the feedback values from the axes. In

100 individual instruments, the robustness and scalability of the concept is

lattice - has one of the strongest possible atomic bonds and can be viewed as a
robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached
without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that
can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene
oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups.
Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and
difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms
or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic
manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and,
essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this
is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each
carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic
hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an
insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains
the hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of
graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The
reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic
state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall
effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of
graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with
designed electronic and other properties.

homonuclear alkali-metal dimers in low-lying rotational and vibrational states,
which are important for experiments designed to produce quantum gases of deeply
bound molecules. We carry out density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of
the nuclear hyperfine coupling constants. For nonrotating states, the
zero-field splittings are determined almost entirely by the scalar nuclear
spin-spin coupling constant. By contrast with the heteronuclear case, the total
nuclear spin remains a good quantum number in a magnetic field. We also
investigate levels with rotational quantum number N = 1, which have long-range
anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions and may be collisionally stable.
For these states the splitting is dominated by nuclear quadrupole coupling for
most of the alkali-metal dimers and the Zeeman splittings are considerably more
complicated.

nanobubbles on submerged hydrophobic surfaces. However, classical theory
dictates that small gaseous bubbles quickly dissolve because their large
Laplace pressure causes a diffusive outflux of gas. Here we suggest that the
bubbles are stabilized by a continuous influx of gas near the contact line, due
to the gas attraction towards hydrophobic walls (Dammer & Lohse, PRL96, 206101

for a meta-stable equilibrium, which however vanishes in thermodynamic

nanobubbles, as well as the threshold for surface nanobubble formation as a
function of hydrophobicity and gas concentration.

extended systems of physical, chemical, and biological nature. A small
perturbation causes gradual change in spatial location of spiral's rotation
center and frequency, i.e. drift. The response functions (RFs) of a spiral wave
are the eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator corresponding to the
critical eigenvalues $\lambda = 0, \pm i\omega$. The RFs describe the spiral's
sensitivity to small perturbations in the way that a spiral is insensitive to
small perturbations where its RFs are close to zero. The velocity of a spiral's
drift is proportional to the convolution of RFs with the perturbation. Here we
develop a regular and generic method of computing the RFs of stationary
rotating spirals in reaction-diffusion equations. We demonstrate the method on
the FitzHugh-Nagumo system and also show convergence of the method with respect
to the computational parameters, i.e. discretization steps and size of the
medium. The obtained RFs are localized at the spiral's core.

midtransit time is measured to within 1 min, and shows no deviation from a
linear ephemeris (and therefore no evidence for orbital perturbations from

the set $\partial^2 F$ of pairs of distinct points of $\partial F$. The space
of geodesic currents on $F$ is a natural companion of Culler-Vogtmann's Outer
space $cv(F)$ and studying them together yields new information about both
spaces as well as about the group $Out(F)$. The main aim of this paper is to
introduce and study the notion of {\it geometric entropy} $h_T(\mu)$ of a
geodesic current $\mu$ with respect to a point $T$ of $cv(F)$, which can be
viewed as a length function on $F$. The geometric entropy is defined as the
slowest rate of exponential decay of $\mu$-measures of bi-infinite cylinders in
$F$, as the $T$-length of the word defining such a cylinder goes to infinity.
We obtain an explicit formula for $h_{T'}(\mu_T)$, where $T,T'$ are arbitrary
points in $cv(F)$ and where $\mu_T$ denotes a Patterson-Sullivan current
corresponding to $T$. It involves the volume entropy $h(T)$ and the extremal
distortion of distances in $T$ with respect to distances in $T'$. It follows
that, given $T$ in the projectivized outer space $CV(F)$, $h_{T'}(\mu_T)$ as
function of $T'\in CV(F)$ achieves a strict global maximum at $T'=T$. We also
show that for any $T\in cv(F)$ and any geodesic current $\mu$ on $F$,
$h_T(\mu)\le h(T)$, where the equality is realized when $\mu=\mu_T$. For points
$T\in cv(F)$ with simplicial metric (where all edges have length one), we
relate the geometric entropy of a current and the measure-theoretic entropy.

that cells have to acquire if the neoplasm is to become an invasive and
malignant cancer. Although the genetic mutations that lead to these phenotypes
are random, the process by which some of these mutations become successful and
spread is influenced by the tumour microenvironment and the presence of other
phenotypes. It is thus likely that some phenotypes that are essential in tumour
progression will emerge in the tumour population only with the prior presence
of other different phenotypes. In this paper we use evolutionary game theory to
analyse the interactions between three different tumour cell phenotypes defined
by autonomous growth, anaerobic glycolysis, and cancer cell invasion. The model
allows to understand certain specific aspects of glioma progression such as the
emergence of diffuse tumour cell invasion in low-grade tumours. We find that
the invasive phenotype is more likely to evolve after the appearance of the
glycolytic phenotype which would explain the ubiquitous presence of invasive
growth in malignant tumours. The result suggests that therapies which increase
the fitness cost of switching to anaerobic glycolysis might decrease the
probability of the emergence of more invasive phenotypes

the evolution of cells in a tumour towards more malignant and aggressive
phenotypes that tend to have a fitness advantage over the older populations.
Although the evolutionary nature of cancer has been recognised for more than
three decades (ever since the seminal work of Nowell) it has been only recently
that tools traditionally used by ecological and evolutionary researchers have
been adopted to study the evolution of cancer phenotypes in populations of
individuals capable of co-operation and competition. In this chapter we will
describe game theory as an important tool to study the emergence of cell
phenotypes in a tumour and will critically review some of its applications in
cancer research. These applications demonstrate that game theory can be used to
understand the dynamics of somatic cancer evolution and suggest new therapies
in which this knowledge could be applied to gain some control over the

those environments surrounding non-HT galaxies and among the densest
environments in a cluster. Additionally, the HT galaxies are found in regions

to substructure groups of 10 members. We propose that it is the high densities
that allow ram pressure to bend the HT galaxies as opposed to previously
proposed mechanisms relying on exceptionally high peculiar velocities.

free layer, parametric resonance occurs. Both collinear configurations,
antiparallel and parallel ones, can become unstable under resonance conditions.
The antiparallel configuration can become unstable under non-resonant
conditions, also. The threshold current density amplitude is of the order of
the dc current density switching the magnetic junction.

analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. If not properly
removed, these sources have adverse effects on the estimation of the
power-spectrum and/or the test of Gaussianity of the CMB component. The
techniques to extract point sources from an observed image used up to now do
not show a general consensus about their real performance and properties. Their
characteristics have been studied essentially through numerical simulations
based on semi-empirical models of the CMB and the Galactic foreground. Such
models often have different levels of sophistication and/or are based on
different physical assumptions (e.g. the number of Galactic components and
level of the noise). Moreover, the application of a given technique to a set of
data (either simulated or experimental) requires the tuning of one or more
parameters that unavoidably is a subjective operation. Hence, a reliable
comparison is difficult. What is missing is a statistical analysis of the
properties of the proposed methodologies. This is the aim of the present paper.
The statistical properties of the detection techniques in the context of two
different criteria, i.e. the Neyman-Pearson criterion and the maximization of
the signal-to-noise ratio, are analyzed through an analytical approach. Various
examples, techniques and the conditions under which they work satisfactorily
are shown together with their limits and implementation details. Exploiting
some a priori information, it is possible to develop simple algorithms with
performances similar to those of more sophisticated but complex techniques. In
this respect, a detection algorithm, useful in future ground-based experiments
as, for example the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is presented.

monitors about 12000 stars in each of its fields of view. Transit detection
algorithms are applied to derive promising planetary candidates, which are then
followed-up with ground-based observations. We present BAST (Berlin Automatic
Search for Transits), a new algorithm for periodic transit detection, and test
it on simulated CoRoT data. BAST searches for box-shaped signals in normalized,
filtered, variability-fitted, and unfolded light curves. A low-pass filter is
applied to remove high-frequency signals, and linear fits to subsections of
data are subtracted to remove the star's variability. A search for periodicity
is then performed in transit events identified above a given detection
threshold. Some criteria are defined to better separate planet candidates from
binary stars.
  From the analysis of simulated CoRoT light curves, we show that the BAST
detection performance is similar to that of the Box-fitting Least-Square (BLS)
method if the signal-to-noise ratio is high. However, the BAST box search for
transits computes 10 times faster than the BLS method. By adding periodic
transits to simulated CoRoT data, we show that the minimum periodic depth
detectable with BAST is a linearly increasing function of the noise level. For
low-noise light curves, the detection limit corresponds to a transit depth
d~0.01%, i.e. a planet of 1 Earth radius around a solar-type star.

induces a stable equivalence of Morita type. For general algebras, it is
unknown when a derived equivalence implies a stable equivalence of Morita type.
In this paper, we first show that each derived equivalence $F$ between the
derived categories of Artin algebras $A$ and $B$ arises naturally a functor
$\bar{F}$ between their stable module categories, which can be used to compare
certain homological dimensions of $A$ with that of $B$; and then we give a
sufficient condition for the functor $\bar{F}$ to be an equivalence. Moreover,
if we work with finite-dimensional algebras over a field, then the sufficient
condition guarantees the existence of a stable equivalence of Morita type. In
this way, we extend the classic result of Rickard. Furthermore, we provide
several inductive methods for constructing those derived equivalences that
induce stable equivalences of Morita type. It turns out that we may produce a
lot of (usually not self-injective) finite-dimensional algebras which are both
derived-equivalent and stably equivalent of Morita type, thus they share many

even well above the critical temperature there is not necessarily a gap in the
Dirac spectrum in pure SU(2) gauge theory. This happens when the Polyakov loop
and the fermion boundary condition combine to give close to periodic boundary
condition for the fermions in the time direction. In this Polyakov loop sector
there is a non-vanishing density of Dirac eigenvalues around zero which implies
that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. I demonstrate this both directly
and also by finding good agreement with the random matrix theory prediction for
the distribution of the lowest Dirac eigenvalue. I show that the chiral
condensate increases with the temperature therefore it is very unlikely to be
explained by topological fluctuations that become rapidly smaller above T_c.
Finally I show that it is only a small fraction of the lowest Dirac eigenvalues
that decide which Polyakov loop sector is favored by the fermion determinant if
dynamical fermions are turned on. This provides a qualitative understanding of
how the loss of confinement above T_c implies the restoration of chiral
symmetry.

the redshift range z=0.2-3.0. The median redshift and luminosity of the sample
are z = 0.98 and L_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. A strong
clustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significant
measurement obtained to date for clustering of X-ray selected AGN. By fitting
the projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales of
r_p=0.3-40 Mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6
+- 0.5 Mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (Poissonian errors; bootstrap
errors are about a factor of 2 larger). An excess signal is observed in the
range r_p~5-15 Mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36
containing about 40 AGN. When removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computing
w(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.
z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 Mpc/h, which is
consistent with that observed for bright optical QSOs at the same redshift.
  We investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured AGN
separately. Within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence that
AGN with broad optical lines (BLAGN) cluster differently from AGN without broad
optical lines (non-BLAGN).
  The correlation length measured for XMM-COSMOS AGN at z~1 is similar to that
of massive galaxies (stellar mass M_*> 3 x 10^{10} M_sun) at the same redshift.
This suggests that AGN at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, as
observed both in the local and in the distant (z~2) Universe. (shortened)

nonparametric regression with unknown noise distribution into a standard
Gaussian regression problem and then apply a wavelet block thresholding
procedure to construct an estimator of the regression function. It is shown
that the estimator simultaneously attains the optimal rate of convergence over
a wide range of the Besov classes, without prior knowledge of the smoothness of
the underlying functions or prior knowledge of the error distribution. The
estimator also automatically adapts to the local smoothness of the underlying
function, and attains the local adaptive minimax rate for estimating functions
at a point. A key technical result in our development is a quantile coupling
theorem which gives a tight bound for the quantile coupling between the sample
medians and a normal variable. This median coupling inequality may be of

the de Sitter background. In general, the presence of a ghost particle, which
has negative energy, drives the vacuum to be unstable through pair production
of ghost particles and ordinary particles. In the case that the vacuum state
preserves the de Sitter invariance, the number density created by the pair
production inevitably diverges due to unsuppressed ultra-violet(UV)
contributions. In such cases one can immediately conclude that the model is not
viable. However, in the massive gravity theory we cannot construct a vacuum
state which respects the de Sitter invariance. Therefore the presence of a
ghost does not immediately mean the breakdown of the model. Explicitly
estimating the number density and the energy density of particles created by
the pair production of two conformal scalar particles and one helicity-0 ghost
graviton, we find that these densities both diverge. However, since models with
helicity-0 ghost graviton have no de Sitter invariant vacuum state, it is
rather natural to consider a UV cutoff scale in the three-dimensional momentum
space. Then, even if we take the cutoff scale as large as the Planck scale, the
created number density and energy density are well suppressed. In many models
the cutoff scale is smaller than the Planck scale. In such models the created
number density and the energy density are negligiblly small as long as only the
physics below the cutoff scale is concerned.

combinatorial objects meeting a prescribed collection of criteria. The
technique can directly be applied to the satisfiability problem, yielding that
a k-CNF formula in which each clause has common variables with at most 2^(k-2)
other clauses is always satisfiable. All hitherto known proofs of the Local
Lemma are non-constructive and do thus not provide a recipe as to how a
satisfying assignment to such a formula can be efficiently found. In his
breakthrough paper [Bec91], Beck demonstrated that if the neighbourhood of each
clause be restricted to O(2^(k/48)), a polynomial time algorithm for the search
problem exists. Alon simplified and randomized his procedure and improved the
bound to O(2^(k/8)) [Alo91]. Srinivasan presented in [Sri08] a variant that
achieves a bound of essentially O(2^(k/4)). In [Mos08], we improved this to
O(2^(k/2)). In the present paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a
satisfying assignment to every k-CNF formula in which each clause has a
neighbourhood of at most the asymptotic optimum of 2^(k-5)-1 other clauses and
that runs in expected time polynomial in the size of the formula, irrespective
of k. If k is considered a constant, we can also give a deterministic variant.
In contrast to all previous approaches, our analysis does not anymore invoke
the standard non-constructive versions of the Local Lemma and can therefore be
considered an alternative, constructive proof of it.

choices of the measure, and compute expectation values for powers of J for
these measures. We find that different choices of the measure generically make
the observed magnitude of CP violation appear finely tuned. Since the quark
masses and the mixing angles are determined by the same set of Yukawa
couplings, we then do a second calculation in which we take the known quark
mass hierarchy into account. We construct the simplest measure on the space of
3 x 3 Hermitian matrices which reproduces this known hierarchy. Calculating
expectation values for powers of J in this second approach, we find that values
of J close to the observed value are now rather likely, and there does not seem
to be any fine tuning. Our results suggest that the choice of Kobayashi-Maskawa
angles is closely linked to the observed mass hierarchy. We close by discussing
the corresponding case of neutrinos.

calculations for low energy e^{+}-H_{2} elastic scattering. Provided that a
sufficiently accurate trial wavefunction is used, we argue that our
implementation of the Kohn variational principle necessarily gives rise to
singularities which are not spurious. We propose two approaches for optimizing
a free parameter of the trial wavefunction in order to avoid anomalous
behaviour in scattering phase shift calculations, the first of which is based
on the existence of such singularities. The second approach is a more
conventional optimization of the generalized Kohn method. Close agreement is
observed between the results of the two optimization schemes; further, they
give results which are seen to be effectively equivalent to those obtained with
the complex Kohn method. The advantage of the first optimization scheme is that
it does not require an explicit solution of the Kohn equations to be found. We
give examples of anomalies which cannot be avoided using either optimization
scheme but show that it is possible to avoid these anomalies by considering
variations in the nonlinear parameters of the trial function.

reproduce both the observed properties and distribution of He-sdO stars.

globular clusters in the Milky Way have been studied using high-resolution
stellar spectra to derive elemental abundances. In this paper we present
elemental abundances for nine HB stars in the metal-rich globular cluster

signal-to-noise spectra obtained with VLT/UVES. The elemental abundances have
been derived using standard LTE calculations. We find that NGC6352 has [Fe/H]=
-0.55, is enhanced in the alpha-elements to about +0.2 dex for Ca, Si, and Ti
relative to Fe. For the iron-peak elements we find solar values. Based on the
spectroscopically derived stellar parameters we find that an E(B-V)=0.24 and

investigation of log(gf)-values for suitable FeI lines lead us to the

on equivalence in a topological setting of analytic torsion to classical
topological torsion, generalizes to this complex-valued torsion. On the

resolution and contiguous imaging in which strong lenses have been discovered,
plus unparalleled multiwavelength coverage. To help interpret the COSMOS data,
we have also produced mock COSMOS strong and weak lensing observations, based
on ray-tracing through the Millenium simulation. In agreement with the
simulations, we find that strongly lensed images with the largest angular
separations are found in the densest regions of the COSMOS field. This is
explained by a prevalence among the lens population in dense environments of
elliptical galaxies with high total-to-stellar mass ratios, which can deflect
light through larger angles. However, we also find that the overall fraction of
elliptical galaxies with strong gravitational lensing is independent of the
local mass density; this observation is not true of the simulations, which
predict an increasing fraction of strong lenses in dense environments. The
discrepancy may be a real effect, but could also be explained by various
limitations of our analysis. For example, our visual search of strong lens
systems could be incomplete and suffer from selection bias; the luminosity
function of elliptical galaxies may differ between our real and simulated data;
or the simplifying assumptions and approximations used in our lensing
simulations may be inadequate. Work is therefore ongoing. Automated searches
for strong lens systems will be particularly important in better constraining
the selection function.

The
model is based in a two level structure. In the first stage one finds an
agent-based model that describes the present state of the investors' beliefs,
perspectives or strategies. The dynamics is inspired by a model for describing
predator-prey population evolution: agents change their mind through self- or
mutual interaction, and the decision is adopted on a random basis, with no
direct influence of the price itself. One of the most appealing properties of
such a system is the presence of large oscillations in the number of agents
sharing the same perspective, what may be linked with the existence of bullish
and bearish periods in financial markets. In the second stage one has the
pricing mechanism, which will be driven by the relative population in the
different investors' groups. The price equation will depend on the specific
nature of the species, and thus it may change from one market to the other: we

Heisenberg chains that are initially prepared in a pure quantum state far from
equilibrium. Our analysis indicates that the antiferromagnetic order imprinted
in the initial state vanishes exponentially. Depending on the anisotropy
parameter, oscillatory or non-oscillatory relaxation dynamics is observed.
Furthermore, the corresponding relaxation time exhibits a at the critical
point, in contrast to the usual notion of critical slowing down, from which a
maximum is expected.

physics grounds. Further observational ways to test different scenarios are

Bott-Morse functions on closed oriented manifolds.
  We carry to this setting the classical concepts of holonomy of invariant sets
and stability, and prove a stability theorem in the spirit of the local
stability theorem of Reeb. This yields, among other things, a good topological
understanding of the leaves one may have around a center-type component of the
singular set, and also of the topology of its basin. The stability theorem
further allows the description of the topology of the boundary of the basin and
how the topology of the leaves changes when passing from inside to outside the
basin. This is described via fiberwise Milnor-Wallace surgery. A key-point for
this is to show that if the boundary of the basin of a center is non-empty,
then it contains a saddle; in this case we say that the center and the saddle
are paired. We then describe the possible pairings one may have in dimension
three and use a construction motivated by the classical saddle-node
bifurcation, that we call foliated surgery, that allows the reduction of
certain pairings of singularities of a foliation. This is used together with
our previous work on the topic to prove an extension for 3-manifolds of Reeb's
sphere recognition theorem.

astrophysical information about many celestial objects. The most promising
sources of gravitational waves are neutron stars and black holes. These objects
emit waves in a very wide spectrum of frequencies determined by their
quasi-normal modes oscillations. In this work we are concerned with the
information we can extract from f and p$_I$-modes when a candidate leaves its
signature in the resonant mass detectors ALLEGRO, EXPLORER, NAUTILUS, MiniGrail
and SCHENBERG. Using the empirical equations, that relate the gravitational
wave frequency and damping time with the mass and radii of the source, we have
calculated the radii of the stars for a given interval of masses $M$ in the
range of frequencies that include the bandwidth of all resonant mass detectors.
With these values we obtain diagrams of mass-radii for different frequencies
that allowed to determine the better candidates to future detection taking in
account the compactness of the source. Finally, to determine which are the
models of compact stars that emit gravitational waves in the frequency band of
the mass resonant detectors, we compare the mass-radii diagrams obtained by
different neutron stars sequences from several relativistic hadronic equations
of state (GM1, GM3, TM1, NL3) and quark matter equations of state (NJL, MTI bag
model). We verify that quark stars obtained from MIT bag model with bag
constant equal to 170 MeV and quark of matter in color-superconductivity phase
are the best candidates for mass resonant detectors.

with strong frequency-dependent dispersion in the presence of a gravitational

frequency, which the slow-light medium converts into a spatially-varying index
of refraction. This results in the bending of a light ray in the medium. We
further propose experimental techniques to amplify and detect the phenomenon
using weak value measurements. Independent heuristic and rigorous derivations
of this effect are given.

and during the main sequence, through magnetized winds. Key theoretical
developments as well as important observational results are summarized in this

the Sd spiral NGC 300, one of the nearest spiral galaxies outside the Local
Group. We have obtained optical spectroscopy for 44 Sculptor Group GC
candidates with the Boller and Chivens (B&C) spectrograph on the Baade
Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. There are 2 GCs in NGC 253 and 12
objects in NGC 300 with globular-cluster-like spectral features, 9 of which
have radial velocities above 0 km/s. The remaining three, due to their radial
velocities being below the expected 95% confidence limit for velocities of NGC
300 halo objects, are flagged as possible foreground stars. The non-clusterlike
candidates included 13 stars, 15 galaxies, and an HII region. One GC, four
galaxies, two stars, and the HII region from our sample were identified in
archival Hubble Space Telescope images. For the GCs, we measure spectral
indices and estimate metallicities using an empirical calibration based on
Milky Way GCs. The GCs of NGC 300 appear similar to those of the Milky Way.
Excluding possible stars and including clusters from the literature, the GC
system (GCS) has a velocity dispersion of 68 km/s, and has no clear evidence of
rotation. The mean metallicity for our full cluster sample plus one literature
object is [Fe/H] = -0.94, lying above the relationship between mean GC
metallicity and overall galaxy luminosity. Excluding the three low-velocity
candidates, we obtain a mean [Fe/H] = -0.98, still higher than expected,
raising the possibility of significant foreground star contamination even in
this sample. Visual confirmation of genuine GCs using high-resolution
space-based imagery could greatly reduce the potential problem of interlopers
in small samples of GCSs in low-radial-velocity galaxies.
