case of magnons moving on RxS2 and working at the semiclassical level. Through
a Pohlmeyer reduction, the problem reduces to another well known integrable
field theory, the sine-Gordon model, which can be exactly described through an
N-body model of Calogero type. The two theories coincide at the level of
equations of motion, but physical quantities like the energies (of magnons and
solitons) and the associated phase shifts are different. We start from the
equivalence of the two systems at the level of equations of motion and require
that the new (string theory) model reproduces the correct magnon energies and
the phase shift, both of which differ from the soliton case. From the
comparison of energies we suggest a Hamiltonian, and from requiring the correct
phase shift we are led to a nontrivial Poisson structure representing the
magnons.

the single-band Hubbard model at half-filling is studied within cellular
dynamical mean field theory for square and triangular lattices.
Finite-temperature exact diagonalization is used to investigate correlations
within two-, three-, and four-site clusters. Transforming the non-local
self-energy from a site basis to a molecular orbital basis, we focus on the
inter-orbital charge transfer between these cluster molecular orbitals in the
vicinity of the Mott transition. In all cases studied, the charge transfer is
found to be small, indicating weak Coulomb induced orbital polarization despite
sizable level splitting between orbitals. These results demonstrate that all
cluster molecular orbitals take part in the Mott transition and that the
insulating gap opens simultaneously across the entire Fermi surface. Thus, at
half-filling we do not find orbital-selective Mott transitions, nor a
combination of band filling and Mott transition in different orbitals.
Nevertheless, the approach towards the transition differs greatly between
cluster orbitals, giving rise to a pronounced momentum variation along the
Fermi surface, in agreement with previous works. The near absence of Coulomb
induced orbital polarization in these clusters differs qualitatively from
single-site multi-orbital studies of several transition metal oxides, where the
Mott phase exhibits nearly complete orbital polarization as a result of a
correlation driven enhancement of the crystal field splitting. The strong
single-particle coupling among cluster orbitals in the single-band case is
identified as the source of this difference.

  We are interested in extending this result to the quantum setting. We prove
extensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur MA and Quantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur
QCMA. Our results have implications for the complexity of approximating the
ground state energy of a quantum local Hamiltonian with a unique ground state
and an inverse polynomial spectral gap. We show that the estimation (to within
polynomial accuracy) of the ground state energy of poly-gapped 1-D local
Hamiltonians is QCMA-hard [AN02], under randomized reductions. This is in stark
contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D Hamiltonians, which is in NP
[Has07]. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be reduced to NP by randomized
reductions, there is no classical description of the ground state of every
poly-gapped local Hamiltonian that allows efficient calculation of expectation
values.
  Finally, we discuss a few of the obstacles to the establishment of an
analogous result to the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA). In particular, we
show that random projections fail to provide a polynomial gap between two

also show that in the Fefferman-Graham coordinates all these solutions have an
integer Taylor series expansion in the radial coordinate (i.e. no $log$ terms).
Specifying an arbitrary stress tensor can lead to two types of pathologies, it
can either destroy the asymptotic AdS boundary condition or it can produce
naked singularities. We show that when solutions have no net angular momentum,
all hydrodynamic stress tensors preserve the asymptotic AdS boundary condition,
though they may produce naked singularities. We construct solutions
corresponding to arbitrary hydrodynamic stress tensors in Fefferman-Graham
coordinates using a derivative expansion. In contrast to Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinates here the constraint equations simplify and at each order it is
manifestly Lorentz covariant. The regularity analysis, becomes more elaborate,
but we can show that there is a unique hydrodynamic stress tensor which gives
us solutions free of naked singularities. In the process we write down explicit
first order solutions in both Fefferman-Graham and Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinates for hydrodynamic stress tensors with arbitrary $\eta/s$. Our

clearly not associated to a bright Ib/c supernova. Moreover, its duration
(T_{90} ~ 100s) makes it hardly classifiable as a short GRB. It presents strong
similarities with GRB970228, the prototype of the new class of ""fake"" short
GRBs that appear to originate from the coalescence of binary neutron stars or
white dwarfs spiraled out into the galactic halo. AIMS: Within the ""canonical""
GRB scenario based on the ""fireshell"" model, we test if GRB060614 can be a
""fake"" or ""disguised"" short GRB. [...] METHODS: We fit GRB060614 light curves
in Swift's BAT (15-150keV) and XRT (0.2-10keV) energy bands. Within the
fireshell model, light curves are formed by two well defined and different
components: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the fireshell transparency, and
the extended afterglow, due to the interaction between the leftover accelerated
baryonic and leptonic shell and the CBM. RESULTS: We determine the two free
parameters describing the GRB source within the fireshell model. [...] A small
average CBM density [...] is inferred, typical of galactic halos. The first
spikelike emission is identified with the P-GRB and the following prolonged
emission with the extended afterglow peak.[...] CONCLUSIONS: The anomalous
GRB060614 finds a natural interpretation within our canonical GRB scenario: it
is a ""disguised"" short GRB. [...] This result points to an old binary system,
likely formed by a white dwarf and a neutron star, as the progenitor of
GRB060614 and well justify the absence of an associated SN Ib/c. Particularly
important for further studies of the final merging process are the temporal
structures in the P-GRB down to 0.1s.

strongly held notion in cosmology. As this can, potentially, be explained with
a modification to General Relativity we look at current cosmological data with
the purpose of testing aspects of gravity. Firstly we constrain a
phenomenological model (mDGP) motivated by a possible extra dimension. This is
characterised by $\alpha$ which interpolates between (LCDM) and (the Dvali
Gabadadze Porrati (DGP) model). In addition, we analyse general signatures of
modified gravity given by the growth parameter $\gamma$ and power spectrum
parameter $\Sigma$. We utilise Weak Lensing data (CFHTLS-wide) in combination
with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) and Supernovae data. We show that
current weak lensing data is not yet capable of constraining either model in
isolation. However we demonstrate that this probe is highly beneficial, for in
combination with BAOs and Supernovae we obtain $\alpha < 0.58$ and $\alpha <
0.91$ at $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. Without the lensing data no
constraint is possible. Both analyses disfavour the flat DGP braneworld model
($\alpha = 1$) at over $2\sigma$. We highlight these are insensitive to
potential systematics in the lensing data. For the growth signature $\gamma$ we
show that, in combination, these probes do not yet have sufficient constraining
power. Finally, we look beyond these present capabilities and demonstrate that
Euclid, a future weak lensing survey, will deeply probe the nature of gravity.
A $1\sigma$ error of 0.104 is found for $\alpha$ ($l_{max} = 500$) whereas for
the general modified signatures we forecast $1\sigma$ errors of 0.045 for

implications of the snap-shot spectral energy distribution for jet models of
blazars. A one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton origin of the entire SED,
including the VHE gamma-ray emission can be ruled out. The VHE emission could,
in principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation
(e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would
require either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an
unrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140. In addition, such a model
fails to reproduce the observed X-ray flux. This as well as the lack of
correlated variability in the optical with the VHE gamma-ray emission and the
substantial gamma-gamma opacity of the BLR radiation field to VHE gamma-rays
suggests a multi-zone model. In particular, an SSC model with an emission
region far outside the BLR reproduces the simultaneous X-ray -- VHE gamma-ray
spectrum of 3C279. Alternatively, a hadronic model is capable of reproducing
the observed SED of 3C279 reasonably well. However, the hadronic model requires
a rather extreme jet power of L_j ~ 10^{49} erg s^{-1}, compared to a
requirement of L_j ~ 2 X 10^{47} erg s^{-1} for a multi-zone leptonic model.

the conditions to reach such a SP2DEG. The equilibrium state is studied at low

recent determination of the SP2DEG correlation energy corrected from the

wave, which existence is a direct consequence of the Coulomb interaction
between the spin polarized electrons, with a dispersion and energy range
typical to the SP2DEG obtained in DMS, the spin density fluctuations exhibiting
a specific collective behaviour when the spin polarization is increased. The
dissipation spectrum through these excitations is studied in detail. Particular
attention is given to the spectrum determined by resonant Raman scattering. We

nonthermal emission even in objects with infrared evidence for disks. We find
radio variability on timescales of decades, days and hours. About half of the

created in relativistic heavy ion collisions since they are mainly generated at
the beginning of collisions and interact with the media in all collision
stages. In addition, heavy flavor quarkonia production is thought to be
uniquely sensitive to the deconfined medium of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
through color screening. Heavy quark production has been studied by the PHENIX
experiment at RHIC via measurements of single leptons from semi-leptonic decays
in both the electron channel at mid-rapidity and in the muon channel at
forward-rapidity. Large suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single
electrons have been observed in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. These
results suggest a large energy loss and flow of the heavy quarks in the hot,
dense matter. The PHENIX experiment has also measured J/psi production up to
sqrt(s) = 200 GeV in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions, both at mid
(|y|<0.35) and forward (1.2<|y|<2.2) rapidities. In the most energetic
collisions (central Au+Au), more suppression is observed at forward rapidity
than at central rapidity. This can be interpreted either as a sign of quark
recombination, or as a hint of additional cold nuclear matter effects. The
current status and understanding of all these measurements will be reviewed.

what may be called the algebra of boundary observables. Interestingly, while
there is a valid context in which this result can be restated as ""S_{BH} counts
all states inside the black hole,"" there may also be another in which it may be
restated as ""$S_{BH}$ does not count all states inside the black hole, but only
those that are distinguishable from the outside."" The arguments and conclusions
represent the author's translation of the community's collective wisdom,
combined with a few recent results. For the proceedings of the

with conventional s-wave superconducting contacts. Despite the s-wave
superconducting state in the contacts, the SB pairing state inside the junction
has d-wave symmetry and clean, sharp interface junctions resemble a
'bulk-meets-bulk' situation with very little interaction between the two
different superconducting states. In fact, due to a finite-size suppression of
the superconducting state, a stronger SB coupling constant than in the bulk is
needed in order to achieve SB pairing in a junction. For both short clean
zigzag and armchair junctions a d-wave state that has a zero Josephson coupling
to the s-wave state is chosen and therefore the Josephson current decreases
when a SB pairing state develops in these junctions. In more realistic
junctions, with smoother doping profiles and atomic scale disorder at the
interfaces, it is possible to achieve some coupling between the contact s-wave
state and the SB d-wave states. In addition, by breaking the appropriate
lattice symmetry at the interface in order to induce another d-wave state, a
non-zero Josephson coupling can be achieved which leads to a substantial
increase in the Josephson current. We also report on the LDOS of the junctions
and on a lack of zero energy states at interfaces despite the unconventional
order parameters, which we attribute to the near degeneracy of the two d-wave
solutions and their mixing at a general interface.

derive the stellar potential from a NIR (K band) wide field image of the

resolution HI map of NGC4579 obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA), allow us
to extend the gravity torque analysis to the outer disk. The bulk of the gas
response traced by the CO PdBI maps follows the expected gas flow pattern
induced by the bar potential in the presence of two Inner Lindblad Resonances
(ILR). We also detect an oval distortion in the inner r~200pc of the K-band
image. The oval is not aligned with the large-scale bar, a signature of
dynamical decoupling. The morphology of the outer disk suggests that the
neutral gas is currently piling up in a pseudo-ring formed by two winding
spiral arms that are morphologically decoupled from the bar structure. In the
outer disk, the decoupling of the spiral allows the gas to efficiently produce
net gas inflow on intermediate scales. The corotation barrier seems to be
overcome due to secular evolution processes. The gas in the inner disk is
efficiently funneled by gravity torques down to r~300pc. Closer to the AGN, the
two m=2 modes (bar and oval) act in concert to produce net gas inflow down to
r~50pc, providing a clear smoking gun evidence of fueling with associated short
dynamical time-scales.

exponential random variable, Frieze proved that the minimum spanning tree has
weight tending to zeta(3)=1/1^3+1/2^3+1/3^3+... as n goes to infinity. We
consider spanning trees constrained to have depth bounded by k from a specified
root. We prove that if k > log_2 log n+omega(1), where omega(1) is any function
going to infinity with n, then the minimum bounded-depth spanning tree still
has weight tending to zeta(3) as n -> infinity, and that if k < log_2 log n,
then the weight is doubly-exponentially large in log_2 log n - k. It is NP-hard
to find the minimum bounded-depth spanning tree, but when k < log_2 log n -
omega(1), a simple greedy algorithm is asymptotically optimal, and when k >
log_2 log n+omega(1), an algorithm which makes small changes to the minimum
(unbounded depth) spanning tree is asymptotically optimal. We prove similar
results for minimum bounded-depth Steiner trees, where the tree must connect a
specified set of m vertices, and may or may not include other vertices. In
particular, when m = const * n, if k > log_2 log n+omega(1), the minimum
bounded-depth Steiner tree on the complete graph has asymptotically the same
weight as the minimum Steiner tree, and if 1 <= k <= log_2 log n-omega(1), the
weight tends to (1-2^{-k}) sqrt{8m/n} [sqrt{2mn}/2^k]^{1/(2^k-1)} in both
expectation and probability. The same results hold for minimum bounded-diameter
Steiner trees when the diameter bound is 2k; when the diameter bound is
increased from 2k to 2k+1, the minimum Steiner tree weight is reduced by a
factor of 2^{1/(2^k-1)}.

We
first consider the possibility of cosmic observers existing at any random time
(including the future) for constant $\Lambda$, and take into account the
suppression of new structure formation as the universe approaches its eternal
DeSitter (DS) geometry. Structures that collapse prior to the era of
$\Lambda$-domination will lose causal contact with our Hubble volume within a
finite (short) conformal time $\tau_{\ast}$. Any remnants within our Hubble
volume then suffer a cosmological heat death after the universe becomes DS. The
probability for finding observers by random measurements in the volume bound by
the DeSitter horizon is $P \simeq 0$, and it is a simple consequence of the
information loss problem for eternal DS spaces resulting from the finite and
constant value of its temperature $T_{DS} \simeq \Lambda^{-1/2}$ and entropy $S
= 3/(G\Lambda)$. By contrast, for geometries with $\Lambda = 0$, structures can
condense and entropy production can continue without bounds at any epoch. The
probability of finding observers in $\Lambda = 0$ geometries is thus
overwhelming higher than in DS spaces. As a result, anthropic reasoning does
not explain the small but nonzero vacuum energy observed in our universe. We
also address the case where observers are considered only at a specially chosen
time -- like the present epoch -- but relax the allowed values of starting
density fluctuations and hence the redshift of galaxy formation. In this latter
case, the bounds on a $\Lambda$ can be millions of times larger than previous
estimates -- and the observed value. We thus conclude that anthropic reasoning
has limited predictive power.

the quasar correlation length from the bias of the host halos. We test our
adopted formulae for the halo mass function and halo bias against measurements
from the large N-body simulation developed by the MICE collaboration. The
strong clustering of AGNs observed at z=3 and, especially, at z=4 implies that
massive black holes reside in rare, massive dark matter halos. Reproducing the
observed luminosity function then requires high efficiency \epsilon and/or low
Eddington ratio \lambda, with a lower limit (based on 2\sigma agreement with
the measured z=4 correlation length) \epsilon> 0.7\lambda/(1+0.7\lambda),
implying \epsilon > 0.17 for \lambda > 0.25. Successful models predict high
duty cycles, P_0~0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 at z=3.1, 4.5 and 6, respectively, and they
require that the fraction of halo baryons locked in the central black hole is
much larger than the locally observed value. The rapid drop in the abundance of
the massive and rare host halos at z>7 implies a proportionally rapid decline
in the number density of luminous quasars, much stronger than simple
extrapolations of the z=3-6 luminosity function would predict. (abridged)

unlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. Based on a new analysis

sequence of models with a range of mass resolution from 1.8K to 18M particles
in the disk and 10K to 100M particles in the halo along with a multi-mass model
with an effective resolution of ~10^10 particles. We describe how mass
resolution affects the bar instability, including its linear growth phase, the
buckling instability, pattern speed decay through the resonant transfer of
angular momentum to the DM halo, and the possible destruction of the halo cusp.
Our higher resolution simulations show a converging spectrum of discrete
resonance interactions between the bar and DM halo orbits. As the pattern speed
decays, orbital resonances sweep through most of the DM halo phase space and
widely distribute angular momentum among the halo particles. The halo does not
develop a flat density core and preserves the cusp, except in the region
dominated by gravitational softening. The formation of the bar increases the
central stellar density and the DM is compressed adiabatically increasing the
halo central density by 1.7X. Overall, the evolution of the bar displays a
convergent behavior for halo particle numbers between 1M and 10M particles,
when comparing bar growth, pattern speed evolution, the DM halo density profile
and a nonlinear analysis of the orbital resonances. Higher resolution
simulations clearly illustrate the importance of discrete resonances in
transporting the angular momentum from the bar to the halo.

be used to enhance the light collecting power over a limited field of view by
about an order of magnitude in flux. This effect is exploited here to increase
the depth of a survey for lensed supernovae at near-IR wavelengths. A pilot SN
search program conducted with the ISAAC camera at VLT is presented. Lensed
galaxies behind the massive clusters A1689, A1835 and AC114 were observed for a
total of 20 hours split into 2, 3 and 4 epochs respectively, separated by
approximately one month to a limiting magnitude J<24 (Vega). Image subtractions
including another 20 hours worth of archival ISAAC/VLT data were used to search
for transients with lightcurve properties consistent with redshifted
supernovae, both in the new and reference data. The feasibility of finding
lensed supernovae in our survey was investigated using synthetic lightcurves of
supernovae and several models of the volumetric Type Ia and core-collapse
supernova rates as a function of redshift. We also estimate the number of
supernova discoveries expected from the inferred star formation rate in the
observed galaxies. The methods consistently predict a Poisson mean value for
the expected number of SNe in the survey between N_SN=0.8 and 1.6 for all
supernova types, evenly distributed between core collapse and Type Ia SN. One
transient object was found behind A1689, 0.5"" from a galaxy with photometric
redshift z_gal=0.6 +- 0.15. The lightcurve and colors of the transient are
consistent with being a reddened Type IIP SN at z_SN=0.59. The lensing model
predicts 1.4 magnitudes of magnification at the location of the transient,
without which this object would not have been detected in the near-IR ground

  In recent years, many researchers design exact exponential-time algorithms
for these and other hard problems. The goal is getting the time complexity
still of order $O(c^n)$, but with the constant $c$ as small as possible. In
this work we extend this line of research and we investigate whether the

trade-offs between approximation factor and the time complexity.
  We study two natural approaches. The first approach consists of designing a
backtracking algorithm with a small search tree. We present one result of that
kind: a $(4r-1)$-approximation of Bandwidth in time $O^*(2^{n/r})$, for any
positive integer $r$.
  The second approach uses general transformations from exponential-time exact
algorithms to approximations that are faster but still exponential-time. For
example, we show that for any reduction rate $r$, one can transform any

set of five differential equations, with the introduction of a new dependent
variable, namely the perturbation to the radial gravity, that is found when the
non-radial effects are considered in the solution of the Poisson equation;
following the scheme of the first paper, we write the equations in such a way
that the two-dimensional effects can be easily disentangled. The key concept
introduced in this series is the equipotential surface. We use the underlying
cause-effect relation to develop a recurrence relation to calculate the
equipotential surface functions for uniform rotation, differential rotation,
rotation-like toroidal magnetic fields and turbulence. We also develop a more
precise code to numerically solve the two-dimensional stellar structure and
evolution equations based on the equipotential surface calculations. We have
shown that with this formulation we can achieve the precision required by
observations by appropriately selecting the convergence criterion. Several
examples are presented to show that the method works well. Since we are
interested in modeling the effects of a dynamo-type field on the detailed
envelope structure and global properties of the Sun, the code has been
optimized for short timescales phenomena (down to 1 yr). The time dependence of
the code has so far been tested exclusively to address such problems.

challenges. In surveys where real-time detection and classification of
transient events is a science driver, there is a need for an effective
elimination of instrument-related artifacts which can masquerade as transient
sources in the detection pipeline, e.g., unremoved large cosmic rays,
saturation trails, reflections, crosstalk artifacts, etc. We have implemented
such an Artifact Filter, using a supervised neural network, for the real-time
processing pipeline in the Palomar-Quest (PQ) survey. After the training phase,
for each object it takes as input a set of measured morphological parameters
and returns the probability of it being a real object. Despite the relatively
low number of training cases for many kinds of artifacts, the overall artifact
classification rate is around 90%, with no genuine transients misclassified
during our real-time scans. Another question is how to assign an optimal
star-galaxy classification in a multi-pass survey, where seeing and other
conditions change between different epochs, potentially producing inconsistent
classifications for the same object. We have implemented a star/galaxy
multipass classifier that makes use of external and a priori knowledge to find
the optimal classification from the individually derived ones. Both these
techniques can be applied to other, similar surveys and data sets.

exhibits outbursts in the near infrared and X-ray domains. These flares are
likely due to energetic events very close to the central object, on a scale of
a few Schwarzschild radii. Optical interferometry will soon be able to provide
astrometry with an accuracy of this order (~10 muas). In this article we use
recent photometric near infrared data observed with the adaptive optics system
NACO at the Very Large Telescope combined with simulations in order to deploy a
method to test the nature of the flares and to predict the possible outcome of
observations with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. To accomplish this
we implement a hot spot model and investigate its appearance for a remote
observer in terms of light curves and centroid tracks, based on general
relativistic ray tracing methods. First, we use a simplified model of a small
steady source in order to investigate the relativistic effects qualitatively. A
more realistic scenario is then being developed by fitting our model to
existing flare data. While indications for the spin of the black hole and
multiple images due to lensing effects are marginal in the light curves,
astrometric measurements offer the possibility to reveal these high-order

universal calendar that would supersede the Gregorian one. However,
17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the
inclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox
observations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing
this problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own,
using the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer
Hipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of
data, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct
length. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to
modern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called
'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that
procedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average)
value of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho
Brahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750,
Newton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the
same regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the
founding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble
(1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.

by the fluid flow can be considered small. We consider a class of compressible
random velocity fields, in which the effect of recirculations is modelled by an
oscillatory component in the Eulerian time correlation profile. The main issue
we address here is whether fluid velocity fluctuations, in particular the
effect of recirculation, may produce nontrivial corrections to the streaming
particle velocity. Our result is that a small (large) degree of recirculation
is associated with a decrease (increase) of streaming with respect to a
quiescent fluid. The presence of this effect is confirmed numerically, away
from the perturbative limit. Our approach also allows us to calculate the
explicit expression for the eddy diffusivity, and to compare the efficiency of
diffusive and ballistic transport.

assessing the state of the plasma. Earlier UVCS observations of CMEs found
evidence that the ejected plasma is heated long after the eruption. We have
investigated the heating rates, which represent a significant fraction of the
CME energy budget. The parameterized heating and radiative and adiabatic
cooling have been used to evaluate the temperature evolution of the CME
material with a time dependent ionization state model. The functional form of a
flux rope model for interplanetary magnetic clouds was also used to
parameterize the heating. We find that continuous heating is required to match
the UVCS observations. To match the O VI-bright knots, a higher heating rate is
required such that the heating energy is greater than the kinetic energy. The
temperatures for the knots bright in Ly$\alpha$ and C III emission indicate
that smaller heating rates are required for those regions. In the context of
the flux rope model, about 75% of the magnetic energy must go into heat in
order to match the O VI observations. We derive tighter constraints on the
heating than earlier analyses, and we show that thermal conduction with the
Spitzer conductivity is not sufficient to account for the heating at large

hypothesized that these masers are tracing circumstellar accretion disks around

what appear to be outflows at similar angles to the maser distribution angles,
not perpendicular as expected in the maser-disk scenario. The main motivation
behind the observations presented here is to determine from the presence and
morphology of an independent outflow tracer, namely SiO, if there are indeed
outflows present in these regions and if they are consistent or inconsistent
with the maser-disk hypothesis. For ten sources with H2 emission we obtained
JCMT single dish SiO (6-5) observations to search for the presence of this
outflow indicator. We followed up those observations with ATCA interferometric
mapping of the SiO emission in the (2-1) line in six sources. The JCMT
observations yielded a detection in the SiO (6-5) line in nine of the ten
sources. All of the sources with bright SiO lines display broad line wings
indicative of outflow. A subset of the sources observed with the JCMT have
methanol maser velocities significantly offset from their parent cloud
velocities, supporting the idea that the masers in these sources are likely not
associated with circumstellar disks. The ATCA maps of the SiO emission show
five of the six sources do indeed have SiO outflows. The spatial orientations
of the outflows are not consistent with the methanol masers delineating disk
orientations. Overall, the observations presented here seem to provide further
evidence against the hypothesis that linearly distributed methanol masers
generally trace the orientations of circumstellar disks around massive young
stars.

Evolutionary systems are certainly examples of such problems: they are composed
of many units that might reproduce, diffuse, mutate, die, or in some cases for
example communicate. These processes might be of some adaptive value, they
influence each other and occur on various time scales. That is why such systems
are so difficult to study. In this paper we briefly review some computational
approaches, as well as our contributions, to the evolution of ecosystems and
language. We start from Lotka-Volterra equations and the modelling of simple
two-species prey-predator systems. Such systems are canonical example for
studying oscillatory behaviour in competitive populations. Then we describe
various approaches to study long-term evolution of multi-species ecosystems. We
emphasize the need to use models that take into account both ecological and
evolutionary processes. Finally, we address the problem of the emergence and
development of language. It is becoming more and more evident that any theory
of language origin and development must be consistent with darwinian principles
of evolution. Consequently, a number of techniques developed for modelling
evolution of complex ecosystems are being applied to the problem of language.
We briefly review some of these approaches.

outflows (a.k.a. feedback) on disk galaxy scaling relations. Our model follows
the accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside
growing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angular
momentum distributions. Models without feedback produce disks that are too
small and rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies,
resulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback
can reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotation
velocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabatic
contraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass,
but our successful models require 25% of the SN energy, or 100% of the SN
momentum, to drive the outflows. It remains to be seen whether such high
efficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy and momentum driven wind models
result in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellar
mass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. Observations
favor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar = 10^{10.5} Msun,
but the momentum driven wind model at high masses. The ratio between the
specific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo, (j_gal/m_gal), is
not unity in our models. Yet this is the standard assumption in models of disk
galaxy formation. Feedback preferentially ejects low angular momentum material
because star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii. This
results in (j_gal/m_gal) increasing with decreasing halo mass. This effect
helps to resolve the discrepancy between the high spin parameters observed for
dwarf galaxies with the low spin parameters predicted from LCDM. [Abridged]

medium enhanced higher twist operators which contribute to the non-radiative
loss of the forward light-cone momentum of the jet ($q^-$) are identified and
the leading correction in the limit of asymptotically high $q^-$ is isolated.
Based on these operator products, a new transport coefficient $\hat{e}$ is
motivated which quantifies the energy loss per unit length encountered by the
hard jet. These operator products are then computed, explicitly, in the case of
a similar hard jet traversing a deconfined quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) in the
hard-thermal-loop (HTL) approximation. This is followed by an evaluation of
sub-leading contributions which are suppressed by the light-cone momentum
$q^-$, which yields the longitudinal ""straggling"" i.e., a slight change in
light cone momentum due to the Brownian propagation through a medium with a
fluctuating color field.

give an efficient implementation of a quantum curvelet transform, together with
two applications: a single-shot measurement procedure for approximately finding
the center of a ball in R^n, given a quantum-sample over the ball; and, a
quantum algorithm for finding the center of a radial function over R^n, given
oracle access to the function. I conjecture that these algorithms succeed with
constant probability, using one quantum-sample and O(1) oracle queries,
respectively, independent of the dimension n -- this can be interpreted as a
quantum speed-up. To support this conjecture, I prove rigorous bounds on the
distribution of probability mass for the continuous curvelet transform. This
shows that the above algorithms work in an idealized ""continuous"" model.

artificial microchannels by studying the dynamics and structure of the front of
a sugar solution traveling in 200 um wide and 50-200 um deep microchannels. We
find that the sugar front travels with constant speed, and that this speed is
proportional to the concentration of the sugar solution and inversely
proportional to the depth of the channel. We propose a theoretical model,
which, in the limit of low axial flow resistance, predicts that the sugar front
indeed should travel with a constant velocity. The model also predicts an
inverse relationship between the depth of the channel and the speed and a
linear relation between the sugar concentration and the speed. We thus find
good agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of the
model. Our motivation for studying osmotically driven flows is that they are
believed to be responsible for the translocation of sugar in plants through the
phloem sieve element cells. Also, we suggest that osmotic elements can act as
integrated pumps with no movable parts in lab-on-a-chip systems.

generalization of Galton Watson processes where at each generation the
reproduction law is picked randomly. In this paper we give several results
which belong to the class of {\it large deviations}. By contrast to the
Galton-Watson case, here random environments and the branching process can
conspire to achieve atypical events such as $Z_n \le e^{cn}$ when $c$ is
smaller than the typical geometric growth rate $\bar L$ and $ Z_n \ge e^{cn}$
when $c > \bar L$. One way to obtain such an atypical rate of growth is to have
a typical realization of the branching process in an atypical sequence of
environments. This gives us a general lower bound for the rate of decrease of
their probability. When each individual leaves at least one offspring in the
next generation almost surely, we compute the exact rate function of these
events and we show that conditionally on the large deviation event, the
trajectory $t \mapsto \frac1n \log Z_{[nt]}, t\in [0,1]$ converges to a
deterministic function $f_c :[0,1] \mapsto \R_+$ in probability in the sense of
the uniform norm. The most interesting case is when $c < \bar L$ and we
authorize individuals to have only one offspring in the next generation. In
this situation, conditionally on $Z_n \le e^{cn}$, the population size stays
fixed at 1 until a time $ \sim n t_c$. After time $n t_c$ an atypical sequence
of environments let $Z_n$ grow with the appropriate rate ($\neq \bar L$) to
reach $c.$ The corresponding map $f_c(t)$ is piecewise linear and is 0 on
$[0,t_c]$ and $f_c(t) = c(t-t_c)/(1-t_c)$ on $[t_c,1].$

restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (FWER),
the probability of at least one false rejection. In many applications, one
might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection provided the number
of such cases is controlled, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to
detect false null hypotheses. This suggests replacing control of the FWER by
controlling the probability of $k$ or more false rejections, which is called
the $k$-FWER. In this article, a unified approach is presented for deriving the
$k$-FWER controlling procedures. We first generalize the well-known closure
principle in the context of the FWER to the case of controlling the $k$-FWER.
Then, we discuss how to derive the $k$-FWER controlling stepwise (stepdown or
stepup) procedures based on marginal $p$-values using this principle. We show
that, under certain conditions, generalized closed testing procedures can be
reduced to stepwise procedures, and any stepwise procedure is equivalent to a
generalized closed testing procedure. Finally, we generalize the well-known
Hommel procedure in two directions, and show that any generalized Hommel
procedure is equivalent to a generalized closed testing procedure with the same
critical values.

speeds.
  Depending on the precollision velocity, colliding molecular clouds produce a
slab that is either shock compressed or pressure confined. In a sequel of two
papers (I & II), we simulate molecular cloud collision and investigate the
dynamical evolution of such slabs. Shocked slabs are susceptible to
hydrodynamic instabilities and in the present paper (I) we study the effect of
strong shear between slab layers on the dynamic evolution of a shock compressed
gas slab. Both, head-on and off-centre cloud collisions have been examined in
this work. We include self gravity in all our simulations.
  Simulations presented here, are performed using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme. Individual, pre-collision clouds are
modelled as pressure confined Bonnor-Ebert spheres. However, in the interest of
brevity the thermodynamic details of the problem are simplified and the gas
temperature is simply evolved by a barytropic equation of state. Obviously, the
gas, to some extent suffers from thermal inertial effects. However, we note
that the dynamical timescale is much smaller than the local sound crossing time
so that such effects should have minimum influence.

matter compatible with cosmological and black-hole horizons. It turns out, in

disordered cosmic strings (""black holes can have curly hair""). We also discuss
different kinds of horizons from the viewpoint of the behavior of tidal forces

falling reference frame. It is shown that all truly naked horizons, as well as
many of those previously characterized as naked and even usual ones, do not
admit an extension and therefore must be considered as singularities. The whole
analysis is performed locally (in a neighborhood of a candidate horizon) in a

correcting for pure measurements errors, a temperature fluctuation on the plane

of the star alpha Cen B and a comparison with theoretical computations of the
stochastic excitation and damping of the modes. We find that at frequencies >
4500 micro-Hz, the model damping rates appear to be too weak to explain the
observed shape of the power spectral density of alpha Cen B. The conclusion
rests on the assumption that most of the disagreement is due to problems
modelling the damping rates, not the excitation rates, of the modes. This
assumption is supported by a parallel analysis of BiSON Sun-as-a-star data, for
which it is possible to use analysis of very long timeseries to place tight
constraints on the assumption. The BiSON analysis shows that there is a similar
high-frequency disagreement between theory and observation in the Sun.
  We demonstrate that by using suitable comparisons of theory and observation
it is possible to make inference on the dependence of the p-mode linewidths on
frequency, without directly measuring those linewidths, even though the alpha
Cen B dataset is only a few nights long. Use of independent measures from a
previous study of the alpha Cen B linewidths in two parts of its spectrum also
allows us to calibrate our linewidth estimates for the star. The resulting
calibrated linewidth curve looks similar to a frequency-scaled version of its
solar cousin, with the scaling factor equal to the ratio of the respective
acoustic cut-off frequencies of the two stars. The ratio of the frequencies at
which the onset of high-frequency problems is seen in both stars is also given
approximately by the same scaling factor.

recovered brightness distribution. In order to facilitate direct comparisons
between the simulations and published VLBI images of SN1993J, the observed
uv-coverage is determined from actual VLBI observations made in the years
following its discovery.
  The underlying source model only exhibits radial variation in its density
profile, with no azimuthal dependence and, even though this model is
morphologically simple, the simulated VLBI observations qualitatively reproduce
many of the azimuthal features of the reported VLBI observations, such as
appearance and evolution of complex azimuthal structure and apparent rotation
of the shell. We demonstrate that such features are inexorably coupled to the
uv-plane sampling.
  The brightness contrast between the peaks and the surrounding shell material
are not as prominent in the simulations (which of course assume no antenna- or
baseline-based amplitude or phase errors, meaning no self-calibration
procedures will have incorporated any such features in models). It is
conclusive that incomplete uv-plane sampling has a drastic effect on the final
images for observations of this nature. Difference imaging reveals residual
emission up to the 8 sigma level. Extreme care should be taken when using

shown to occur in the localized case rather than in the collective case, where
entanglement tends to `ring down'. A consequence of the QND character of the
interaction is that the time-evolved fidelity of a Bell state never falls below
$1/\sqrt{2}$, a fact that is useful for quantum communication applications like
a quantum repeater. Using a novel quantification of mixed state entanglement,
we show that there are noise regimes where even though entanglement vanishes,
the state is still available for applications like NMR quantum computation,

the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the film is
shown to be the relevant parameter of the problem. In particular, it is shown
that if the film is submitted to a tensile stress, the microcracks produced by

making the layer transfer process impossible. However, if the compressive
stress exceeds a threshold value, after layer transfer, the film can buckle and
delaminate, leading to transverse cracks induced by bending. As a result, we
show that the imposed stress \sigma_m - or equivalently the heating temperature

  bounded media","RevTex4, 5 pages",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nonequilibrium photon Green function for a bounded medium surrounded by
vacuum is analyzed on the basis of the Dyson equation. As its components, the
field-field fluctuations as well as the spectral function split up into parts
related to medium and vacuum. Particularly, it is shown that the vacuum-induced
fluctuations describe propagation of arbitrary, even nonclassical light in
terms of solutions of the classical wave propagation problem. The results
generalize previously obtained ones for steadily excited media in slab
geometry.

magnetic field at frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency are
considered. We consider Alfv\'en--ion-cyclotron waves,
fast-magnetosonic--whistler waves, and ion-sound waves. Especially the weakly
turbulent low-beta plasmas like the solar corona are studied, using the
cold-plasma dispersion relation for the transverse waves and the
fluid-description of the warm plasma for the longitudinal waves. We analyse the
resonance conditions for the wave frequencies $\omega$ and wavenumbers $k$, and
the interaction rates of the waves for all possible combinations of the three
wave modes, and list those reactions that are not forbidden.

continuously evolving dynamical systems from a geometric perspective. We
clarify that an unambiguous definition of stability generally requires the
choice of additional geometric structure that is not intrinsic to the dynamical
system itself. While global Lyapunov stability is based on the choice of
seminorms on the vector bundle of perturbations, we propose a definition of
local stability based on the choice of a linear connection. We show how this
definition reproduces known stability criteria for second order dynamical
systems. In contrast to the general case, the special geometry of Lagrangian
systems provides completely intrinsic notions of global and local stability. We
demonstrate that these do not suffer from the limitations occurring in the
analysis of the Maupertuis-Jacobi geodesics associated to natural Lagrangian
systems.

atomic beam generated using a dual-stage laser back-ablation apparatus.
Distributions are measured using a velocity selective Doppler time-of-flight
technique. They are Boltzmann-like with rms velocities corresponding to
temperatures above the melting point for calcium. Contrary to a recent report
in the literature, this method does not generate a sub-thermal atomic beam.
