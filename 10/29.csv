Sky Survey (SDSS), calibrate fitting formulae which correct for known problems
with photometric reductions of extended objects, apply these corrections, and
then measure a number of pairwise scaling relations in the corrected sample. We
show that, because they are not seeing corrected, the use of Petrosian-based
quantities in magnitude limited surveys leads to biases, and suggest that this
is one reason why Petrosian-based analyses of BCGs have failed to find
significant differences from the bulk of the early-type population. These
biases are not present when seeing-corrected parameters derived from
deVaucouleur fits are used. Most of the scaling relations we study show
evidence for curvature: the most luminous galaxies have smaller velocity
dispersions, larger sizes, and fainter surface brightnesses than expected if
there were no curva-ture. These statements remain true if we replace
luminosities with stellar masses; they suggest that dissipation is less
important at the massive end. There is curvature in the dynamical to stellar
mass relation as well: the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass increases as
stellar mass increases, but it curves upwards from this scaling both at small
and large stellar masses. In all cases, the curvature at low masses becomes
apparent when the sample becomes dominated by objects with stellar masses
smaller than 3 x 10^10 M_Sun. We quantify all these trends using second order
polynomials; these generally provide significantly better description of the
data than linear fits, except at the least luminous end.

traditional Fundamental Plane in four bands. We then replaced luminosity with
stellar mass, and measured the ""stellar mass"" FP. The FP steepens slightly as
one moves from shorter to longer wavelengths: the orthogonal fit has slope 1.40
in g and 1.47 in z. The FP is thinner at longer wavelengths: scatter is 0.062
dex in g, 0.054 dex in z. The scatter is larger at small galaxy sizes/masses;
at large masses measurement errors account for essentially all of the observed
scatter. The FP steepens further when luminosity is replaced with stellar mass,
to slope ~ 1.6. The intrinsic scatter also reduces further, to 0.048 dex. Since
color and stellar mass-to-light ratio are closely related, this explains why
color can be thought of as the fourth FP parameter. However, the slope of the
stellar mass FP remains shallower than the value of 2 associated with the
virial theorem. This is because the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass
increases at large masses as M_d^0.17. The face-on view of the stellar mass
kappa-space suggests that there is an upper limit to the stellar density for a
given dynamical mass, and this decreases at large masses: M_*/R_e^3 ~ M_d^-4/3.
We also study how the estimated coefficients a and b of the FP are affected by
other selection effects (e.g. excluding small sigma biases a high; excluding
fainter L biases a low). These biases are seen in FPs which have no intrinsic
curvature, so the observation that a and b scale with L and sigma is not, by
itself, evidence that the Plane is warped. We show that the FP appears to curve
sharply downwards at the small mass end, and more gradually downwards towards
larger masses. Whereas the drop at small sizes is real, most of the latter
effect is due to correlated errors.

perturbation theory the $\Lambda$ contribution was missed because of initial
too-stringent smallness assumptions. Namely: Our method has been to insert a
Kottler (Schwarzschild with $\Lambda$) vacuole into a Friedmann universe, and
to calculate the total bending within the vacuole. We assume that no more
bending occurs outside. It is important to observe that while the mass
contribution to the bending takes place mainly quite near the lens, the
$\Lambda$ bending continues throughout the vacuole. Thus if one deliberately
restricts one's search for $\Lambda$ bending to the immediate neighborhood of
the lens, one will not find it. Lastly, we show that the $\Lambda$ bending also
follows from standard Weyl focusing, and so again, it cannot be a coordinate
effect.

brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies (~40 galaxies
apiece), we have explored the dependence of HII region properties on local and
global disc surface brightness. We have done this by constructing co-added HII
region luminosity functions (LFs) according to local and central disc surface
brightness and fitting Schechter functions to these LFs. The results show that
the shape of the HII region LF within LSB galaxies does not change noticeably
as different limiting (i.e., mu>mu_lim) local surface brightness values are
used. However, the LFs for HSB galaxies have larger values of L_* and are less
steep at the faint-end than those of LSB galaxies for limiting B-band local
surface brightness values as faint as mu_B,lim~23-24. Both the LFs and the data
for individual HII regions show that luminous (log L>39 ergs/s) HII regions are
much more common within HSB discs than within LSB discs, implying that the
newly formed star clusters are also larger. Taking this into account along with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations, the shapes of the LFs imply that the
regions within LSB discs and those within the LSB areas of HSB discs are
relatively old (~5 Myr) while the regions within HSB discs for mu_B<24 are
significantly younger (<1 Myr). Since the majority of the LSB galaxies do not
have noticeable spiral arms and the majority of the HSB galaxies do, this may
indicate a transition within HSB discs from spiral arm-driven star formation to
a more locally driven, possibly sporadic form of star formation at mu_B~24, a
transition that does not appear to occur within LSB discs.

Particular attention is paid to the identification of the main physical

internal structure, composition and heat content as well as its formation
history. Although the general description of these properties is reasonably

points to some missing physics in our present modelling of at least some of

show significant excess emission in the mid-infrared, several million years
after the proto-planetary disk is thought to disperse. Theoretical models
suggest this peak may coincide with the formation of Pluto-sized planetesimals
in the disk, stirring smaller bodies into collisional destruction. Here we
present resolved mid-infrared imaging of the disk of eta Tel (A0V in the BPMG)
and consider its implications for the state of planet formation in this system.
eta Tel was observed at 11.7 and 18.3um using T-ReCS on Gemini South. The
resulting images were compared to simple disk models to constrain the radial
distribution of the emitting material. The emission observed at 18.3um is shown
to be significantly extended beyond the PSF along a position angle 8 degrees.
This is the first time dust emission has been resolved around eta Tel.
Modelling indicates that the extension arises from an edge-on disk of radius
0.5 arcsec (~24 AU). Combining the spatial constraints from the imaging with
those from the spectral energy distribution shows that >50% of the 18um
emission comes from an unresolved dust component at ~4 AU. The radial structure
of the eta Tel debris disk is reminiscent of the Solar System, suggesting that
this is a young Solar System analogue. For an age of 12Myr, both the radius and
dust level of the extended cooler component are consistent with self-stirring
models for a protoplanetary disk of 0.7 times minimum mass solar nebula. The
origin of the hot dust component may arise in an asteroid belt undergoing
collisional destruction, or in massive collisions in ongoing terrestrial planet
formation.

associated energy and spectral efficiency measures of the bandwidth-limited
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power-limited low SNR regimes, and utilize
them in investigating the large system behavior of the multiuser relay channel
as a function of the number of users and physical channel SNRs. Our analysis
results in very accurate closed-form formulas in the large (but finite) $K$

likely because of the presence of circumstellar dust related to their winds. We

variability which is due to its LBV nature rather than to a heating of the gas

in close binary systems. They play an important role as cosmological distance
indicators and have led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the
Universe. Among the most important unsolved questions are how the explosion
actually proceeds and whether accretion occurs from a companion or via the
merging of two white dwarfs. Tycho Brahe's supernova of 1572 (SN 1572) is
thought to be one of the best candidates for a SN Ia in the Milky Way. The
proximity of the SN 1572 remnant has allowed detailed studies, such as the
possible identification of the binary companion, and provides a unique
opportunity to test theories of the explosion mechanism and the nature of the
progenitor. The determination of the yet unknown exact spectroscopic type of SN
1572 is crucial to relate these results to the diverse population of SNe Ia.
Here we report an optical spectrum of Tycho Brahe's supernova near maximum
brightness, obtained from a scattered-light echo more than four centuries after
the direct light of the explosion swept past Earth. We find that SN 1572
belongs to the majority class of normal SNe Ia. The presence of a strong Ca II
IR feature at velocities exceeding 20,000 km/s, which is similar to the
previously observed polarized features in other SNe Ia, suggests asphericity in
SN 1572.

SKA provide a number of challenges for interferometric data analysis. These
challenges include heterogeneous arrays, direction-dependent instrumental gain,
and refractive and scintillating atmospheric conditions. From the analysis
perspective, this means that calibration solutions can not be described using a
single complex gain per antenna. In this paper we use the optimal map-making
formalism developed for CMB analyses to extend traditional interferometric
radio analysis techniques--removing the assumption of a single complex gain per
antenna and allowing more complete descriptions of the instrumental and
atmospheric conditions. Due to the similarity with holographic mapping of radio
antenna surfaces, we call this extended analysis approach software holography.
The resulting analysis algorithms are computationally efficient, unbiased, and
optimally sensitive. We show how software holography can be used to solve some
of the challenges of next generation observations, and how more familiar
analysis techniques can be derived as limiting cases.

systems with the same open-loop control input. From a viewpoint of mathematical
control theory, this class of problems is challenging because it requires
steering a continuum of dynamical systems between points of interest in an
infinite dimensional state space by use of the same control function. The
existence of such a control raises fundamental questions of ensemble
controllability. We derive the necessary and sufficient controllability
conditions and an accompanying analytical optimal control law for ensemble
control of time-varying linear systems. We show that ensemble controllability
is in connection with singular values of the operator characterizing the system

find that non-axisymmetric potentials with fixed axis ratios change only the
normalization of the mock velocity fields and rotation curves and not their

small and large radii into agreement with observations. Indeed, to match the
slow rise of LSB galaxy rotation curves, a specific viewing angle of the
non-axisymmetric potential is required. For each of the simulated LSB galaxies,
the observer's line-of-sight must be along the minor axis of the potential, an
arrangement which is inconsistent with a random distribution of halo

allowed to establish connection between the QCD Lagrangian and quark potential
models, a prominent outcome being the Cornell (linear plus Coulomb) potential.
In being quite successful in explaining properties of heavy flavor hadrons, be
them quarkonia or baryons, this potential has been found less spectacular in
the description of the non-strange baryons, the nucleon and the Delta. This
behavior indicates that the one-gluon exchange and the flux-tube interaction do
not fully account for the complexity of the dynamics of three light quarks.
Very recently, the Cornell potential which is of infinte range has been
upgraded by us toward an exactly solvable trigonometric potential of finite
range that interpolates between the inverse-distance potential and the infinite
wells while passing through a region of linear growth, a reason for which it
contains the inverse distance and the linear potentials as first terms in its
Taylor series decomposition. We here first make the point that the upgraded
Cornell potential can be viewed as the exact counterpart on a curved space to a
flat space 1/r potential, a circumstance that equips it by two simultaneous
symmetries, SO(4), and SO(2,1). These allow to place the trigonometric
confinement potential in the context of AdS_5/CFT correspondence and thus to
establish the link of the algebraic aspects of the latter to QCD potentiology.
Next we report that the above potential when employed in the quark-diquark
system, provides a remarkably adequate description of both nucleon and Delta
spectra and the proton mean square charge radius as well, and moreover implies
an intriguing venue toward quark deconfinement as shut-down of the curvature
considered as temperature dependent.

planes in magnesium diboride. And, in the nearly filled (with negative
electrons) bands of almost all superconductors, as evidenced by their positive
Hall coefficient in the normal state. According to the theory of hole
superconductivity, metals become superconducting because they are driven to
expel negative charge (electrons) from their interior. This is why NIS
tunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased
samples. It is also why there is a Meissner effect: as electrons are expelled
towards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force
imparts them with azimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner
current that screens the interior magnetic field. In type II superconductors,
the Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach the surface
gives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents. In the absence of
applied magnetic field, expelled electrons still acquire azimuthal velocity,
due to the spin-orbit interaction, in opposite direction for spin-up and
spin-down electrons: the ""Spin Meissner effect"". This results in a macroscopic
spin current flowing near the surface of superconductors in the absence of
applied fields. In strongly type II superconductors this physics should give
rise to charge inhomogeneity and spin currents throughout the interior of the
superconductor, to large sensitivity to (non-magnetic) disorder and to a strong
tendency to phase separation.

component of the 11 Mpc H-alpha UV Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which is providing
H-alpha and GALEX UV imaging for an approximately volume-limited sample of ~300
star-forming galaxies within 11 Mpc. We first examine the completeness
properties of the sample, and then directly tally the number of bursting dwarfs
and compute the fraction of star formation that is concentrated in such
systems. Our results are consistent with a picture where dwarfs that are
currently experiencing massive global bursts are just the ~6% tip of a low-mass
galaxy iceberg. Moreover, bursts are only responsible for about a quarter of
the total star formation in the overall dwarf population, so the majority of
stars in low-mass systems are not formed in this mode today. Spirals and
irregulars devoid of H-alpha emission are rare, indicating that the complete
cessation of star formation generally does not occur in such galaxies and is
not characteristic of the inter-burst state, at least for the more luminous
systems with M(B)<-15. The starburst statistics presented here directly
constrain the duty cycle and the average burst amplitude under the simplest

previously while the flux was (2.64 +/- 0.14)E-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Thus, the
source appears to remain in the hard state even at the highest flux levels

consistent with the source being in a luminous hard state and a black hole mass
in the range of one to a few thousand solar masses.

Our
sample stars have X-ray and H-alpha emission indicative of saturated emission,
i.e., emission at a high level independent of rotation rate. Our measurements
are made using near-infrared FeH molecular spectra observed with HIRES at Keck.
Because of their large convective overturn times, the rotation velocity of M
stars with small Rossby numbers is relatively slow and does not hamper the
measurement of Zeeman splitting. The Rossby numbers of our sample stars are as
small as 0.01. All our sample stars exhibit magnetic flux of kilo-Gauss
strength. We find that the magnetic flux saturates in the same regime as
saturation of coronal and chromospheric emission, at a critical Rossby number
of around 0.1. The filling factors of both field and emission are near unity by
then. We conclude that the strength of surface magnetic fields remains
independent of rotation rate below that; making the Rossby number yet smaller
by a factor of ten has little effect. These saturated M-star dynamos generate
an integrated magnetic flux of roughly 3 kG, with a scatter of about 1 kG. The
relation between emission and flux also has substantial scatter.

stars have been carried out using realistic initial models for the presupernova
star and assuming standard spherically symmetric explosions of 1.2*10^51ergs.
Stars of 15 and 25 solar masses with both primordial and solar composition were
modeled. The zero metallicity supernova progenitors were compact blue stars and
the amount of Rayleigh-Taylor induced mixing in them was greatly reduced
compared with what was seen in the red supergiants with solar metallicity. The
compact zero-metal stars also experienced more fallback than their solar
metallicity counterparts. As a result, the ejected nucleosynthesis from the two
populations was very different. For the simple explosion model assumed, low
metallicity stars ejected ejected too little iron and intermediate mass
elements even to explain the abundance patterns in the most iron-poor stars
found to date, suggesting that some important ingredient is missing. Rotation
is likely to alter these conclusions by producing a greater fraction of red
supergiants among Population III stars. The velocities of the heavy elements in
all models considered - both red and blue supergiants - were less than observed
in SN 1987A, suggesting that at least occasionally, asymmetric aspects of the
explosion mechanism and fallback play a major role in mixing.

CRs to sufficiently high energies need to be much higher than can result from
compression of the circumstellar medium (CSM) by a factor 4, as is the case in
strong shocks. Non-thermal synchrotron maps of these regions indicate that
indeed the magnetic field is much stronger, and for young SNRs has a dominant
radial component while for old SNRs it is mainly toroidal. How these magnetic
fields get enhanced, or why the field orientation is mainly radial for young
remnants, is not yet fully understood. We use an adaptive mesh refinement MHD
code, AMRVAC, to simulate the evolution of supernova remnants and to see if we
can reproduce a mainly radial magnetic field in early stages of evolution. We
follow the evolution of the SNR with three different configurations of the
initial magnetic field in the CSM: an initially mainly toroidal field, a
turbulent magnetic field, and a field parallel to the symmetry axis. Although
for the latter two topologies a significant radial field component arises at
the contact discontinuity due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, no radial
component can be seen out to the forward shock. Ideal MHD appears not
sufficient to explain observations. Possibly a higher compression ratio and
additional turbulence due to dominant presence of CRs can help us to better
reproduce the observations in future studies.

Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. The first one uses the standard approach of
surface gravity evaluated at the possible horizons. The second method derives
its results via the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) which offers a yet
different method to look at the problem. In the case of a Schwarzschild black
hole it is known that this methods affirms the existence of a black hole
remnant (minimal mass $M_{\rm min}$) of the order of Planck mass $m_{\rm pl}$
and a corresponding maximal temperature $T_{\rm max}$ also of the order of
$m_{\rm pl}$. The standard $T(M)$ dispersion relation is, in the GUP
formulation, deformed in the vicinity of Planck length $l_{\rm pl}$ which is
the smallest value the horizon can take. We generalize the uncertainty
principle to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime with the cosmological constant
$\varLambda=1/m_\varLambda^2$ and find a dual relation which, compared to
$M_{\rm min}$ and $T_{\rm max}$, affirms the existence of a maximal mass
$M_{\rm max}$ of the order $(m_{\rm pl}/m_\varLambda)m_{\rm pl}$, minimum
temperature $T_{\rm min} \sim m_\varLambda$. As compared to the standard
approach we find a deformed dispersion relation $T(M)$ close to $l_{\rm pl}$
and in addition at the maximally possible horizon approximately at
$r_\varLambda=1/m_\varLambda$. $T(M)$ agrees with the standard results at
$l_{\rm pl} \ll r \ll r_\varLambda$ (or equivalently at $M_{\rm min} \ll M \ll

the stellar distribution in the multi-dimensional space spanned by spatial
coordinates, velocity and metallicity, from the solar neighborhood all the way
out to the outer Milky Way halo. While these results represent exciting
observational breakthroughs, their interpretation is not simple. For example,
traditional decomposition of the thin and thick disks predicts a strong
correlation in metallicity and kinematics at $\sim$1 kpc from the Galactic
plane; however, recent SDSS--based work has demonstrated an absence of this
correlation for disk stars. Instead, the variation of the metallicity and
rotational velocity distributions can be modeled using non--Gaussian functions
that retain their shapes and only shift as the distance from the mid--plane
increases. To fully contextualize these recent observational results, a
detailed comparison with sophisticated numerical models is necessary. Modern
simulations have sufficient resolution and physical detail to study the
formation of stellar disks and spheroids over a large baseline of masses and
cosmic ages. We discuss preliminary comparisons of various observed maps and
N--body model predictions and find them encouraging. In particular, the N--body
disk models of Ro\v{s}kar et al. \cite{Roskar 2008} reproduce a change of disk
scale height reminiscent of thin/thick disk decomposition, as well as
metallicity and rotational velocity gradients, while not inducing a correlation

recently made by employing SDSS and POSS data. Common to most studies is a
fundamental assumption that photometric observations at two epochs for a large
number of quasars will reveal the same statistical properties as well-sampled
light curves for individual objects. We critically test this assumption using
light curves for a sample of $\sim$2,600 spectroscopically confirmed quasars
observed about 50 times on average over 8 years by the SDSS stripe 82 survey.
We find that the dependence of the mean structure function computed for
individual quasars on luminosity, rest-frame wavelength and time is
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the behavior of the structure
function derived from two-epoch observations of a much larger sample. We also
reproduce the result that the variability properties of radio and X-ray
selected subsamples are different. However, the scatter of the variability
structure function for fixed values of luminosity, rest-frame wavelength and
time is similar to the scatter induced by the variance of these quantities in
the analyzed sample. Hence, our results suggest that, although the statistical
properties of quasar variability inferred using two-epoch data capture some
underlying physics, there is significant additional information that can be
extracted from well-sampled light curves for individual objects.

new Hilbert space of de Sitter invariant states can be constructed via
so-called group-averaging techniques. We study this construction for free
scalar fields of arbitrary positive mass in any dimension, and for linear
vector and tensor gauge fields in any dimension. Our main result is to show in
each case that group averaging converges for states containing a sufficient

cooling, and ejection of baryonic mass, as a function of radius, inside growing
dark matter haloes. The surface density profile of the disk is determined by
detailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of
specific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations. Exponential and
quasi-exponential disks can be produced by our model through a combination of
supernova driven galactic outflows (which preferentially remove low angular
momentum material), intrinsic variation in the angular momentum distribution of
the halo gas, and the inefficiency of star formation at large radii. We use
observations from the SDSS NYU-VAGC to show that the median Sersic index of
blue galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For blue galaxies, low mass
galaxies have a median n=1.3, while high mass galaxies have a median n=4. Our
model with energy driven outflows correctly reproduces this trend, whereas our
models with momentum driven outflows and no outflows over predict the Sersic
indices in low mass galaxies. We show that the observed fraction of
""bulge-less"" exponential galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For
Milky-Way mass galaxies less than 0.1% of blue galaxies are bulge-less, whereas
for M33 mass galaxies bulge-less and quasi-bulgeless galaxies are typical.
These results suggest that the difficulty of hierarchical formation models to
produce bulge-less Milky-Way mass galaxies is in fact not a problem. However,
the problem of producing M33 like galaxies remains, and will provide a key test
for hierarchical galaxy formation models. [Abridged]

the presence of both disorder and magnetic field. The XY coupling is assumed to
have the form -J\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j-A_{ij}), where A_{ij} has a mean of zero
and a standard deviation \Delta A_{ij}. In a real system, such a model would be
approximately realized by a 2D array of small Josephson-coupled grains with
slight spatial disorder and a uniform applied magnetic field. The different
values \Delta A_{ij} then corresponds to an applied field such that the average
number of flux quanta per plaquette has various integer values N: larger N
corresponds to larger \Delta A_{ij}. For any value of \Delta A_{ij}, there
appears to be a critical coupling constant K_c(\Delta
A_{ij})=\sqrt{[J/(2U)]_c}, where U is the charging energy, above which the
system is a Mott insulator; there is also a corresponding critical conductivity
\sigma^*(\Delta A_{ij}) at the transition. For \Delta A_{ij}=\infty, the order
parameter of the transition is a renormalized coupling constant g. Using a
numerical technique appropriate for disordered systems, we show that the
transition at this value of \Delta A_{ij} takes place from an insulating (I)
phase to a Bose glass (BG) phase, and that the dynamical critical exponent
characterizing this transition is z \sim 1.3. By contrast, z=1 for this model
at \Delta A_{ij}=0. We suggest that the superconductor to insulator transition
is actually of this I to BG class at all nonzero \Delta A_{ij}'s, and we
support this interpretation by both numerical evidence and an analytical
argument based on the Harris criterion.

that, for a general rational manifold, the number of geometrically distinct
periodic orbits is bounded from below by the ratio of the minimal Chern number
and half of the dimension. These generalizations of the Conley conjecture
follow from another result proved here asserting that a Hamiltonian
diffeomorphism with a symplectically degenerate maximum on a closed rational
manifold has infinitely many periodic orbits.

diffeomorphisms the minimal action--index gap remains bounded for some infinite
sequence of iterations and, as a consequence, whenever a Hamiltonian
diffeomorphism has finitely many periodic orbits, the actions and mean indices
of these orbits must satisfy a certain relation. Furthermore, for Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms of the n-dimensional complex projective space with exactly n+1
periodic orbits a stronger result holds. Namely, for such a Hamiltonian
diffeomorphism, the difference of the action and the mean index on a periodic
orbit is independent of the orbit, provided that the symplectic structure on

applying constraints from hydrodynamical processes that result from the
disk-planet interaction. We compute the planet's internal structure using a
Henyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the
protoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous
models of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be
approximately one Hill sphere radius, Rhill. However, 3-D hydrodynamic
simulations show that only gas within 0.25Rhill remains bound to the planet,
with the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the
protoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer
boundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach
the portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller
radius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. Thermal
pressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as
massive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas
hydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a
moderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is
about equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits
to accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. To
account for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's
growth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of
3Myr. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and
thermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current
retinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. (1979).

Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope under development by a consortium of 17
countries. The SKA will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio
facility. A majority of the key science for the SKA will be addressed through
large-area imaging of the Universe at frequencies from 300 MHz to a few GHz.
  The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is aimed squarely in this frequency
range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and
deployment of phase-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. This large
field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope poised to achieve
substantial advances in SKA key science. The central core of ASKAP will be
located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of
the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of the sites selected by
the international community as a potential location for the SKA.
  Following an introductory description of ASKAP, this document contains 7
chapters describing specific science programmes for ASKAP.
  The combination of location, technological innovation and scientific program
will ensure that ASKAP will be a world-leading radio astronomy facility,
closely aligned with the scientific and technical direction of the SKA. A brief
summary chapter emphasizes the point, and considers discovery space.

thick accretion disk. The innermost temperature and radius of the accretion
disk was measured to be $T_{\rm in} = 1.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} $ keV and $R_{\rm

60^\circ /\cos i)$ with $i$ being the disk inclination. The bolometric
luminosity of the source was estimated to be $L_{\rm bol} = 1.82 \times 10^{39}

analyzed for long-term spectral variations. In almost all observations, the
source showed multi-color black-body-like X-ray spectra with parameters similar
to those in the Suzaku observation. In only one Chandra observation, however,
Source 3 was found to exhibit a power-law-like spectrum, with a photon index of
$\Gamma = 2.37 \pm 0.08$, when it was fainter by about $\sim 15 %$ than in the
Suzaku observation. The spectral behavior is naturally explained in terms of a
transition between the slim disk state and the ""very high"" states, both found
in Galactic black hole binaries when their luminosity approach the Eddington
limit. These results are utilized to argue that ultraluminous X-ray sources
generally have significantly higher black-hole masses than ordinary
stellar-mass black holes.

temporal correlation of neuronal discharges may serve to bind distributed

coding. The $\theta$ and $\delta$ rhythms are shown to be involved in various

depth of an{\ae}sthesia. We introduce a thalamocortical model of interacting

$\delta$ oscillations, especially during deep and light an{\ae}sthesia.
Asymmetric and long range interactions among the thalamocortical neuronal
oscillators are taken into account. The model results are compared with the

be one of the primary sources of very low frequency gravitational waves (GWs).
Significant contribution of the GWs comes from mergers of massive galaxies with
redshifts z<2. Very few previous studies gave the merger rate of massive
galaxies. % We selected a large sample (1209) of close pairs of galaxies with
projected separations 7<r_p<50 kpc from 87,889 luminous early-type galaxies
(M_r<-21.5) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. These pairs
constitute a complete volume-limited sample in the local universe (z<0.12).
Using our newly developed technique, 249 mergers have been identified by
searching for interaction features. From them, we found that the merger
fraction of luminous early-type galaxies is 0.8%, and the merger rate in the
local universe is % R_g=(1.0+/-0.4)*10^{-5} Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}} % with an
uncertainty mainly depending on the merging timescale. % We estimated the
masses of SMBHs in the centers of merging galaxies based on their luminosities.
We found that the chirp mass distribution of the SMBH binaries follows a power
law with an index of -3.0+/-0.5 in the range 5*10^8--5*10^{9} M_{\odot}. %
Using the SMBH population in the mergers and assuming that the SMBHs can be
efficiently driven into the GW regime, we investigated the stochastic GW
background in the frequency range 10^{-9}--10^{-7} Hz. We obtained the spectrum
of the GW background of h_c(f)=10^{-15}(f/yr^{-1})^{-2/3}, which is one
magnitude higher than that obtained by Jaffe & Backer in 2003, but consistent
with those calculated from galaxy-formation models.

performance as the oracle estimator up to a possible logarithmic term. Then,
minimax properties of $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$ on Besov spaces ${\cal

prove that $$\sup_{f\in B^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q}\cap \ensuremath \mathbb

result has two consequences. First, it establishes that the minimax rate of
Besov spaces ${\cal B}^{\ensuremath \alpha}_{p,q}$ with $p\leq 2$ when non
compactly supported functions are considered is the same as for compactly
supported functions up to a logarithmic term. When $p>2$, the rate exponent,
which depends on $p$, deteriorates when $p$ increases, which means that the
support plays a harmful role in this case. Furthermore, $\tilde{f}_{n,\gamma}$
is adaptive minimax up to a logarithmic term.

measurements $\mu_j(M)$. In this paper $\mu_j(M)$ are always the moments
$m_j(M)=\int x^jM_p(x)dx$. This problem is a central one in Signal Processing,
Statistics, and in many other applications.
  We concentrate on a direct (and somewhat ""naive"") approach to the above
problem: we simply substitute the model function $M_p(x)$ into the measurements
$\mu_j$ and compute explicitly the resulting ""symbolic"" expressions of
$\mu_j(M_p)$ in terms of the parameters $p$. Equating these ""symbolic""
expressions to the actual measurement results, we produce a system of nonlinear
equations on the parameters $p$, which we consequently try to solve.
  The aim of this paper is to review some recent results (mostly of
\cite{Vet5,Mil1,Mil2,Put1,Vet4,Vet3,Mil3,Mil4,Vet2}) in this direction,
stressing the algebraic structure of the arising systems and mathematical tools
required for their solutions.
  In particular, we discuss the relation of the reconstruction problem above
with the recent results of \cite{bfy,bry,chr,pak1,pak2,pak3,pry,ry} on the
vanishing problem of generalized polynomial moments and on the Cauchy-type
integrals of algebraic functions.
  The accompanying paper \cite{Kis1} (this volume) provides a solution method
for a wide class of reconstruction problems as above, based on the study of
linear differential equations with rational coefficient, which are satisfied by
the moment generating function of the problem.

relative to the solar values with a positional dependency along the radial
direction of the Cygnus Loop. The abundances in the very edge of the limb shows
about half the solar value, whereas other regions inside the Loop show about
0.2 times the solar value which has been believed as a typical value for the

quite similar to that found in the north-east (NE) limb of the Loop, and thus
this is another evidence of abundance inhomogeneity in the limb regions of the
Loop. The radio map shows a quite different feature: the NE limb is in the
radio bright region while the SE limb shows almost no radio. Therefore, the
metal abundance variation in the SE limb can not attribute to the non-thermal
emission. The abundance inhomogeneity as well as the metal depletion down to

theoretically dubious, since, at it is not hard to see, it can represent an
extreme simplification of a more accurate, e.g. Copeland-Lahiri, string

generally speaking, phenomenological and rough, obtained final results,
unexpectedly, are non-trivial. Concretely, given formalism reproduces exactly
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon
area and Hawking temperature of a weakly charged, rotating, very thin black

Aestefanesei, Radu etc. (Conceptually it is similar to situation in Bohr's
atomic model where energy levels are determined practically exactly even if
electron motion is described roughly.) Our formalism is physically based on the
assumption that circumference of the horizon tube holds the natural (integer)
number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is conceptually
similar to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model interpreted by
de Broglie relation.) Also, we use, mathematically, practically only simple
algebraic equations.

having well defined phase relationship. In this paper we report new results
from the multifrequency GMRT observations of this pulsar. Significant linear
polarization is observed with depolarization at the edge of the profile, due to
orthogonal polarization. Circular polarization changes sign near the middle of
the pulse profile at 1060 MHz, but not observed at 325 and 610 MHz. Remarkable
frequency evolution of polarization angle (PA) is observed. Based on the
frequency evolution of average profile, PA swing and results from subpulse
drifting, we propose two possible emission geometries, alpha~11 deg, beta~-5.4
deg and alpha~175.4 deg, beta~-6.9 deg. Simulation of the pulsar radiation
pattern with both these geometries reproduces the observed features in the
drift pattern quite well. In addition to the remarkable subpulse drifting
observed at 325 MHz, we report subpulse drifting at 244 and 610 MHz. We observe
changes of drift rates, transitions from negative to stationary and stationary
to negative drift rates, with some connection with nulls. Though P3m is the
same for all the drift regions, P2m and Delta(Phi) values are different for the
inner and outer drift regions. The peak emission from the leading and the
trailing outer regions are offset by ~ 9 P1. Utilising this information, we
solve the aliasing problem and predict P4~ 10 s, which makes it the fastest
known carousel. The drift pattern from the two rings are phase locked for PSR
B0818-41. The same is found to be true for, all pulsars showing drifting in
multiple rings of emission and puts constraints on the theoretical models of
pulsar emission mechanism and, favors a pan magnetospeheric radiation
mechanism.

the Helmholtz free energy functional, which yields the random phase
approximation (RPA) for the pair direct correlation functions, we calculate the
equilibrium fluid density profiles of the two species of particles adsorbed at
a planar wall. We show that for a particular choice (repulsive exponential) of
the wall potentials and the fluid pair-potential parameters, the Euler-Lagrange
equations for the equilibrium fluid density profiles may be transformed into a
single ordinary differential equation and the profiles obtained by a simple
quadrature. For certain other choices of the fluid pair-potential parameters
fluid-fluid phase separation of the bulk fluid is observed. We find that when
such a mixture is exposed to a planar hard-wall, the fluid exhibits complete
wetting on the species 2 poor side of the binodal, i.e. we observe a thick film
of fluid rich in species 2 adsorbed at the hard-wall. The thickness of the
wetting film grows logarithmically with the concentration difference between
the fluid state-point and the binodal and is proportional to the bulk
correlation length of the intruding (wetting) fluid phase. However, for state
points on the binodal that are further from the critical point, we find there
is no thick wetting film. We determine the accompanying line of first-order
(pre-wetting) surface phase transitions which separate a thin and thick
adsorbed film. We show that for some other choices of repulsive wall potentials
the pre-wetting line is still present, but its location and extent in the phase
diagram is strongly dependent on the wall-fluid interaction parameters.

investigated in depth through X-ray observations ranging from 0.1 to 200 keV.
The low energy X-ray data from Chandra reveal a complex morphology that is
characterised by a bright central plerion, no thermal shell and an extended
diffuse halo. The spectral emission from the central plerion softens with
radial distance from the pulsar, with the spectral index ranging from $\Gamma $
= 1.61 in the central region to $\Gamma $ =2.36 at the edge of the PWN. At
higher energy INTEGRAL detected the source in the 17--200 keV range. The data
analysis clearly shows that the main contribution to the spectral emission in
the hard X-ray energy range is originated from the PWN, while the pulsar is
dominant above 200 keV. Recent HESS observations in the high energy gamma-ray
domain show that PSR J1833-1034 is a bright TeV emitter, with a flux
corresponding to $\sim$2 per cent of the Crab in 1--10 TeV range. In addition
the spectral shape in the TeV energy region matches well with that in the hard
X-rays observed by INTEGRAL. Based on these findings, we conclude that the
emission from the pulsar and its associated PWN can be described in a scenario
where hard X-rays are produced through synchrotron light of electrons with
Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim10^{9}$ in a magnetic field of $\sim$10 micro Gauss.
In this hypothesis the TeV emission is due to Inverse Compton interaction of
the cooled electrons off the Cosmic Microwave Background photons. Search for
PSR J1833-1034 X-ray pulsed emission, via RXTE and Swift X-ray observations,
resulted in an upper limit that is about 50 per cent.

the enhancement variables $\mathring{c}_j$ are presumed to be subcritical or

cases where the classical theories involve zero modes at $T_{c,\infty}$. This
applies when either both $\mathring{c}_j$ take the critical value
$\mathring{c}_{\text{sp}}$ associated with the special surface transition, or
else periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Owing to the zero modes, the
$\epsilon$ expansion becomes ill-defined at $T_{c,\infty}$. Analogously to the
static case, the field theory can be reorganized to obtain a well-defined
small-$\epsilon$ expansion involving half-integer powers of $\epsilon$,
modulated by powers of $\ln\epsilon$. Explicit results for the scaling

positions of Fe I lines reveal asymmetries and wavelength shifts that indicate
the presence of granulation. In particular, line bisectors show characteristic
C-shapes while line core wavelengths are blueshifted by an amount that
increases with decreasing equivalent width (EW). On average, Fe I line
bisectors have a span that ranges from nearly 0 for the weakest lines (residual
core flux > 0.7) to about 75 m/s for the strongest lines (residual core flux ~
0.3) while wavelength shifts range from about -150 m/s in the weakest (EW ~ 10
mA) lines to 0 in the strongest (EW > 100 mA) features. A more detailed
inspection of the bisectors and wavelength shifts reveals star-to-star
differences that are likely associated with differences in stellar parameters,
projected rotational velocity, and stellar activity. For the inactive, slow
projected rotational velocity stars, we detect, unequivocally, a plateau in the
line-shifts at large EW values (EW > 100 mA), a behavior that had been
identified before only in the solar spectrum. The detection of this plateau
allows us to determine the zero point of the convective blueshifts, which is
useful to determine absolute radial velocities. Thus, we are able to measure
such velocities with a mean uncertainty of about 60 m/s.

calculated both for electron-hole pairs and for electrons and holes separately

evaluating the matrix elements (between Kohn-Sham states) of the rate of change

allows for direct access to the excitation spectra. The method is applied to
adsorption of atomic hydrogen isotopes on the Al(111) surface. The results are
compatible with the available experimental data (for noble metal surfaces); in
particular, the observed isotope effect in H versus D adsorption is described
by the present theory. Moreover, the results are in qualitative agreement with
computationally elaborate calculations of the full dynamics within
time-dependent density-functional theory, with the notable exception of effects
due to the spin dynamics. Being a perturbational approach, the method proposed

sum of changes in black hole entropy and the ordinary entropy of matter and
fields outside the hole must be non-negative. In the classical limit, the GSL
reduces to Hawking's area theorem. Neither law identifies the specific effects
which makes it work in particular situations. Motivated by Davies' recent
gedanken experiment he used to infer a bound on the size of the fine structure
constant from the GSL, we study a series of variants in which an electric test
charge is lowered to a finite radius and then dropped into a Schwarzschild, a
near-extremal magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom or a near-extremal Kerr black hole.
For a classical charge, we demonstrate that a specific ""backreaction"" effect is
responsible for protecting the area theorem in the near-extremal examples. For
the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom hole an area theorem violation is
defused by taking into account a subtle source of repulsion of the charge: the
spinning up of the black hole in the process of bringing the charge down to its
dropping point. In Kerr hole case, the electric self-force on the charge is
sufficient to right matters. However, in all experiments involving an
elementary charge, the full GSL would apparently be violated were the fine
structure constant greater than about order unity. We argue that in this case a
quantum effect, the Unruh-Wald quantum buoyancy, may protect the GSL.

the nature of what is actually being observed.
  We investigate the lack of obvious structures of magnetic origin such as
fibrils and mottles in on-disk Ca II H and K images by directly comparing a
temporal sequence of classical Ca II K filtergrams with a co-spatial and
co-temporal sequence of spectrally resolved Ca II 854.2 images obtained with
the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS), considering the effect
of both the spectral and spatial smearing. We find that the lack of fine
magnetic structuring in Ca II K filtergrams, even with the narrowest available
filters, is due to observational effects. Signatures of fibrils remain however
in the temporal evolution of the filtergrams, in particular with the evidence
of magnetic shadows around the network elements. The Ca II K filtergrams do not
appear, however, to properly reflect the high-frequency behavior of the
chromosphere. Using the same analysis, we find no significant chromospheric
signature in the Hinode/SOT Ca II H quiet-Sun filtergrams.
  The picture provided by H-alpha and Ca II 854.2, which show significant
portions of the chromosphere dominated by magnetic structuring, appears to
reflect the true and essential nature of the solar chromosphere. Data which do
not resolve, spatially or spectrally, this aspect may misrepresent the behavior

instability is examined in one spatial dimension. The box length resolves one
pair of current filaments. A small, a medium-sized and a large filament are
considered and compared. The magnetic field amplitude at the saturation time of
the filamentation instability is proportional to the filament size. It is
demonstrated, that the force on the electrons imposed by the electrostatic
field, which develops during the nonlinear stage of the instability, oscillates
around a mean value that equals the magnetic pressure gradient force. The
forces acting on the electrons due to the electrostatic and the magnetic field
have a similar strength. The electrostatic field reduces the confining force
close to the stable equilibrium of each filament and increases it farther away.
The confining potential is not sinusoidal, as assumed by the magnetic trapping
model, and it permits an overlap of current filaments (plasmons) with an
opposite flow direction. The scaling of the saturation amplitude of the
magnetic field with the filament size observed here thus differs from that
expected from the magnetic trapping model. The latter nevertheless gives a good
estimate for the magnetic saturation amplitude. The increase of the peak
electrostatic and magnetic field amplitudes with the filament size implies,
that the electrons heat up more and that the spatial modulation of their mean
speed along the beam flow direction increases with the filament size.

is a Poisson-distributed random variable. Under the Binomial model, however,
the total number of data in the training samples is fixed, although again each
data value is assigned in a random way. Although the values of risk and regret
associated with the Poisson and Binomial models are different, they are
asymptotically equivalent to first order, and also to the risks associated with
kernel-based classifiers that are tailored to the case of two derivatives.
These properties motivate new methods for choosing the value of $k$.

the (nearly heretical) postulate that electrons are physical objects that obey

expressions based on Newtonian force balances are used to predict ionization

Fermi satellite is investigated in this work. Under the assumptions that dark
matter annihilation accounts for the ""GeV excess"" of the Galactic diffuse
$\gamma$-rays discovered by EGRET and the $\gamma$-ray flux is dominated by the
contribution from subhaloes of dark matter, we calculate the expected number of
dark matter subhaloes that Fermi may detect. We show that Fermi may detect a
few tens to several hundred subhaloes in 1-year all sky survey. Since EGRET
observation is taken as a normalization, this prediction is independent of the
particle physics property of dark matter. The uncertainties of the prediction
are discussed in detail. We find that the major uncertainty comes from the mass
function of subhaloes, i.e., whether the subhaloes are ""point like"" (high-mass
rich) or ""diffuse like"" (low-mass rich). Other uncertainties like the
background estimation and the observational errors will contribute a factor of
$2\sim 3$.

by tunnel boring or the collapse of underground cavities, whether natural or
man-made. The impact of the movements of the ground on existing structures is
generally dramatic. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict these
movements (settlements and horizontal extension or compression displacements).
Even though it is obvious that the overall stiffness and weight of the
structure influences the size and shape of the soil movement, the main features
of this soil-structure interaction phenomenon are not well established. Caudron
et al. (2006) developed an original small-scale physical model to take the
soil-structure interaction into account. It is based on the use of the
frictional Schneebeli material (assembly of small diameter rods) and a modified
version including cohesion in order to reproduce a cohesive layer above a
cavity. The displacements of the soil are obtained from digital images
processing by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Interesting results were
obtained, probing that the soil-structure interactions could be analysed by
this experimental model. This article is focused in a first part on the
influence of the position of the structure with respect to the cavity position.
Consequences on the areas mainly concerned by horizontal compression or
extension of the structure are determined. It appears that the stresses induced
in the building are a superposition of several elementary loading (sum of the
effects of the slope, the horizontal deformations and the curvature). The
second part concerns the effect of the relative soil/structure stiffness on the
ground movement during a cavity collapse by considering a second model of
structure with similar dimensions but more flexible.

(DM) annihilation signals is of utmost importance for indirect DM searches. To
this end, one has to rely on distinctive -- and unique -- spectral signatures
to look for. Internal bremsstrahlung (IB), unavoidable in the presence of
charged annihilation products, provides such a signature. In fact, as it
generically dominates the gamma-ray spectrum expected from DM annihilations, at
high energies, it may well turn out to be more important for indirect DM
searches than the traditionally looked-for line signals. As illustrated in some
detail, the observation of IB signatures would even allow to distinguish
between different DM candidates or to constrain significantly the parameter
space of, e.g., neutralino DM. The gamma-ray contributions reported here are
therefore of great interest for the already launched Fermi/GLAST satellite and
the upcoming new generation of Air Cherenkov Telescope systems like CTA --
which are most sensitive at the high energies where these effects are
particularly important. Finally, radiative corrections may even significantly
alter the positron spectrum from DM annihilations; an intriguing positron
excess recently found by the PAMELA satellite might turn out to be an
indication of the peculiar spectral signature expected in that case.

vacuum has recently attracted renewed interest. In these proceedings we will
argue that metastability is an attractive and testable scenario. The recent
developments were triggered by the presentation of a simple and calculable
model of metastable SUSY breaking by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS),
which we will briefly review. One of the main questions raised by metastability
is, why did the universe end up in this vacuum. Using the ISS model as an
example we will argue that in a large class of models the universe is
automatically driven into the metastable state during the early hot phase and
gets trapped there. This makes metastability a natural option from the
cosmological point of view. However, it may be more than that. The
phenomenologically required gaugino masses require the breaking of R-symmetry.
However, in scenarios with a low supersymmetry breaking scale, e.g., gauge
mediation a powerful theorem due to Nelson and Seiberg places this at odds with
supersymmetry breaking in a truely stable state and metstability becomes
(nearly) inevitable. Turning around one can now experimentally test whether
gauge mediation is realised in nature thereby automatically testing the
possibility of a metastability of the vacuum. Indeed, already the LHC may give
us crucial information about the stability of the vacuum.

"0810.5310","Gabriele Nebe","Michael Hentschel, Gabriele Nebe","Hermitian modular forms congruent to 1 modulo p",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For any natural number $\ell $ and any prime $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ not
dividing $\ell $ there is a Hermitian modular form of arbitrary genus $n$ over
$L:=\Q [\sqrt{-\ell}]$ that is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ which is a Hermitian
theta series of an $O_L$-lattice of rank $p-1$ admitting a fixed point free
automorphism of order $p$. It is shown that also for non-free lattices such
theta series are modular forms.
