spectra which identify them as having recently undergone a strong starburst and
subsequent fast quenching of star formation. These post-starburst galaxies lie
in the redshift range 0.5<z<1.0 with masses >10^9.75Msun. They have a number
density of 1x10^-4 per Mpc^3, almost two orders of magnitude sparser than the
full galaxy population with the same mass limit. We compare with simulations to
show that the galaxies are consistent with being the descendants of gas rich
major mergers. Starburst mass fractions must be larger than ~5-10% and decay
times shorter than ~10^8 years for post-starburst spectral signatures to be
observed in the simulations. We find that the presence of black hole feedback
does not greatly affect the evolution of the simulated merger remnants through
the post-starburst phase. The multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of
the post-starburst galaxies show that 5/16 have completely ceased the formation
of new stars. These 5 galaxies correspond to a mass flux entering the
red-sequence of rhodot(A->Q, PSB) = 0.0038Msun/Mpc^3/yr, assuming the defining
spectroscopic features are detectable for 0.35Gyr. If the galaxies subsequently
remain on the red sequence, this accounts for 38(+4/-11)% of the growth rate of
the red sequence. Finally, we compare our high redshift results with a sample
of galaxies with 0.05<z<0.1 observed in the SDSS and UKIDSS surveys. We find a
very strong redshift evolution: the mass density of strong post-starburst
galaxies is 230 times lower at z~0.07 than at z~0.7.

The global fits to the grating spectra show that the temperature of the X-ray
emitting plasma in the slower shocks in this system has remained stable for the
last three years, while that in the faster shocks has decreased. This
temperature evolution is confirmed by the first light curves of strong X-ray
emission lines and their ratios. On the other hand, bulk gas velocities
inferred from the X-ray line profiles are too low to account for the post-shock
plasma temperatures inferred from spectral fits. This suggests that the X-ray
emission comes from gas that has been shocked twice, first by the blast wave
and again by shocks reflected from the inner ring of SNR 1987A. A new model
that takes these considerations into account gives support to this physical
picture.

about the existence of timescale separation between the dynamics of the
measured observable and the typical timescale of the noise allows external
fluctuations to be modeled as temporally uncorrelated and therefore white.
However, in many natural phenomena the assumptions concerning the
abovementioned properties of ""Gaussianity"" and ""whiteness"" of the noise can be
violated. In this context, in contrast to the spatiotemporal coupling
characterizing general forms of non-Markovian or semi-Markovian L\'evy walks,
so called L\'evy flights correspond to the class of Markov processes which
still can be interpreted as white, but distributed according to a more general,
infinitely divisible, stable and non-Gaussian law. L\'evy noise-driven

around the Wolf-Rayet binary gamma^2 Vel and its early-type companion gamma^1
Vel. Several hundred PMS stars are identified and the youth of a subset of
these is confirmed by the presence of lithium, H-alpha emission and X-ray
activity. We show that the PMS stars are kinematically coherent and spatially
concentrated around gamma Vel. The PMS stars have similar proper motions to
gamma Vel, to main-sequence stars around gammaVel and to early-type stars of
the wider Vela OB2 association of which gamma^2 Vel is the brightest member.
The ratio of main-sequence stars to low-mass (0.1-0.6 Msun) PMS stars is
consistent with a Kroupa mass function. Main-sequence fitting to stars around
gamma Vel gives a distance modulus of 7.76+/-0.07 mag, consistent with a
similarly-determined distance for Vela OB2 and with interferometric distances
to gamma^2 Vel. High-mass stellar models indicate an age of 3-4 Myr for gamma^2
Vel, but the low-mass PMS stars have ages of ~10 Myr according to low-mass
evolutionary models and 5-10 Myr by empirically placing them in an age sequence
with other clusters based on colour-magnitude diagrams and lithium depletion.
We conclude that the low-mass PMS stars form a genuine association with gamma
Vel and that this is a subcluster within the larger Vela OB2 association. We
speculate that gamma^2 Vel formed after the low-mass stars, expelling gas,
terminating star formation and unbinding the association. The velocity
dispersion of the PMS stars is too low for this star forming event to have
produced all the stars in Vela OB2. Instead, star formation must have started
at several sites within a molecular cloud, either sequentially or,
simultaneously after some triggering event [abridged].

large-$N_c$ QCD, and those in a closely related holographic model. We find that
as the baryon chemical potential is increased above a critical value, there is
a phase transition to a nuclear matter phase, the details of which depend on
the model. We argue that the nuclear matter phase is necessarily inhomogeneous
to arbitrarily high density, which suggests an explanation of the ""chiral
density wave"" instability of the quark Fermi surface in large-$N_c$ QCD. Some
details of the instanton distribution in the holographic dual are reminiscent
of a Fermi surface. This short manuscript summarizes a talk given by M.R. at
""Theory Canada 4"" conference, and is based largely (but not entirely) on the
results of \cite{Rozalietal2008}.

simultaneous sparse approximations and subspace projection. It permits to
represent each 3D face by only a few spherical functions that are able to

further activated for improved recognition performance. The 3D face recognition

distinguished: (i) a layer given form by an underlying classical deterministic
process, incorporating essentially logical thought and its indeterministic
version modeled by classical probability theory; (ii) a layer given form under
influence of the totality of the surrounding conceptual landscape, where the
different concepts figure as individual entities rather than (logical)
combinations of others, with measurable quantities such as 'typicality',
'membership', 'representativeness', 'similarity', 'applicability', 'preference'
or 'utility' carrying the influences. We call the process in this second layer
'quantum conceptual thought', which is indeterministic in essence, and contains
holistic aspects, but is equally well, although very differently, organized
than logical thought. A substantial part of the 'quantum conceptual thought
process' can be modeled by quantum mechanical probabilistic and mathematical
structures. We consider examples of three specific domains of research where
the effects of the presence of quantum conceptual thought and its deviations
from classical logical thought have been noticed and studied, i.e. economics,
decision theory, and concept theories and which provide experimental evidence

compact binaries with precession effects through 1.5PN order in amplitude and
compute their mode decomposition using spin-weighted -2 spherical harmonics. In
the presence of precession, the gravitational-wave modes (l,m) contain
harmonics originating from combinations of the orbital frequency and precession
frequencies. We find that the gravitational radiation from binary systems with
large mass asymmetry and large inclination angle can be distributed among
several modes. For example, during the last stages of inspiral, for some
maximally spinning configurations, the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes
can be comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the mass ratio is not
too extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes are generally one or two orders of magnitude
smaller than the l = 2 modes. Restricting ourselves to spinning, non-precessing
compact binaries, we apply the stationary-phase approximation and derive the
frequency-domain gravitational waveforms including spin-orbit and spin(1)-
spin(2) effects through 1.5PN and 2PN order respectively in amplitude, and
2.5PN order in phase. Since spin effects in the amplitude through 2PN order
affect only the first and second harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not
extend the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors. However, they can
interfere with other harmonics and lower or raise the signal-to-noise ratio
depending on the spin orientation. These ready-to-use waveforms could be
employed in the data-analysis of the spinning, inspiraling binaries as well as
in comparison studies at the interface between analytical and numerical
relativity.

the astrometric anomaly found in region C. The detected satellite is consistent
with the abundance of subhaloes expected in the halo from cold dark matter

satellite as computed from lens modeling is found to be higher than that
predicted by CDM simulations.

evidence for an excess of positrons at high (~ 10 - 100 GeV) energies,
confirming earlier indications from HEAT and AMS-01. Such a signal is generally
expected from dark matter annihilations. However, the hard positron spectrum
and large amplitude are difficult to achieve in most conventional WIMP models.
The absence of any associated excess in anti-protons is highly constraining on
any model with hadronic annihilation modes. We revisit an earlier proposal,
whereby the dark matter annihilates into a new light (<~GeV) boson phi, which
is kinematically constrained to go to hard leptonic states, without
anti-protons or pi0's. We find this provides a very good fit to the data. The
light boson naturally provides a mechanism by which large cross sections can be
achieved through the Sommerfeld enhancement, as was recently proposed.
Depending on the mass of the WIMP, the rise may continue above 300 GeV, the
extent of PAMELA's ability to discriminate electrons and positrons.

populations of low-mass stars in globular clusters in order to study whether
the energy equipartition process can explain the high number of stars
harbouring abundance anomalies seen in globular clusters. We analyse N-body
models by artificially dividing the low-mass stars (m<0.9 Msun) into two
populations: a small number of stars (second generation) consistent with an
invariant IMF and with low specific energies initially concentrated towards the
cluster-centre mimic stars with abundance anomalies. These stars form from the
slow winds of fast-rotating massive stars. The main part of low-mass (first
generation) stars has the pristine composition of the cluster. We study in
detail how the two populations evolve under the influence of two-body elaxation
and the tidal forces due to the host galaxy.Stars with low specific energy
initially concentrated toward the cluster centre need about two relaxation
times to achieve a complete homogenisation throughout the cluster. For
realistic globular clusters, the number ratio between the two populations
increases only by a factor 2.5 due to the preferential evaporation of the
population of outlying first generation stars. We also find that the loss of
information on the stellar orbital angular momentum occurs on the same
timescale as spatial homogenisation.

landscape. It arises as a linear combination of internal space components of
higher rank forms, which are axion-like at low energies, and may mix with
4-forms after compactification of the Chern-Simons terms to 4D due to internal
space fluxes. The mixing induces an effective mass term, with an action which
{\it preserves} the axion shift symmetry, breaking it spontaneously after the
background selection. With several axions, several 4-forms, and a low string
scale, as in one of the setups already invoked for dynamically explaining a
tiny residual vacuum energy in string theory, the 4D mass matrix generated by
random fluxes may have ultralight eigenmodes over the landscape, which are
quintessence. We illustrate how this works in simplest cases, and outline how
to get the lightest mass to be comparable to the Hubble scale now, $H_0 \sim
10^{-33} {\rm eV}$. The shift symmetry protects the smallest mass from
perturbative corrections in field theory. Further, if the ultralight eigenmode
does not couple directly to any sector strongly coupled at a high scale, the
non-perturbative field theory corrections to its potential will also be
suppressed. Finally, if the compactification length is larger than the string
length by more than an order of magnitude, the gravitational corrections may
remain small too, even when the field value approaches $M_{Pl}$.

are in position to determine the stability of different configurations, to
predict new (also half-metallic) ground states and to extend the known
Slater-Pauling rule for ideally stoichiometric Heusler alloys to
non-stoichiometric, Mn-rich compositions. This enables us to identify
potentially half-metallic structures in the Mn-rich region. With the help of
Monte Carlo simulations based on the cluster expansion, we establish
theoretically that Co_2-xMn_1+xSi close to the stoichiometric composition ought
to show a high degree of structural order in thermodynamic equilibrium. Hence,
samples prepared with the correct stoichiometry should indeed be half-metallic
after thermal annealing. Moreover, we predict that adding a small amount of Mn
to stoichiometric Co_2MnSi allows to suppress the thermally activated formation
of detrimental Co antisites. At Mn-rich compositions (x>1), the ordered ground
state structures predicted for zero temperature are found to be thermally
unstable and to decompose into Co2MnSi and Mn3Si above room temperature.

whether heating by energetic particles or dissipative MHD wave can account for

of the hydrogen atom, along with all elements of the H-like iso-electronic
sequence, is now fully nl-resolved. We show how the predicted HI spectrum
differs from the pure recombination case. The second update is to the rates for
H^0 - H2 inelastic collisions. We now use the values computed by Wrathmall et

  We calculate the chemistry, ionization, temperature, gas pressure, and
emission-line spectrum for a wide range of gas densities and collisional
heating rates. We assume that the filaments are magnetically confined and free
to move along field lines so that the gas pressure is equal to that of the
surrounding hot gas. A mix of clouds, some being dense and cold and others hot
and tenuous, can exist. The observed spectrum will be the integrated emission
from clouds with different densities and temperatures but the same pressure. We
assume that the gas filling factor is given by a power law in density. The
power-law index is set by matching the observed intensities of IR H2 lines
relative to optical HI lines. We conclude that the filaments are heated by
ionizing particles, either conducted in from surrounding regions or produced in
situ by processes related to MHD waves.

self-gravitating cloud and we find that the numerical analysis is consistent
with the results predicted by the diagrams. While the inclusion of a
homogeneous magnetic field approximately perpendicular to the impact velocity
of the SNR with an intensity ~1 $mu$G results only a small shrinking of the
star formation zone in the diagrams, a larger magnetic field (~10 $\mu$G)
causes a significant shrinking, as expected. Applications of our results to
real star formation regions in our own galaxy have revealed that their
formation could have been triggered by a SN shock wave. Finally, we have
evaluated the effective global star formation efficiency of this sort of
interactions and found that it is smaller than the observed values in our
Galaxy (SFE ~0.01-0.3). This result is consistent with previous work in the
literature and also suggests that the mechanism presently investigated, though
very powerful to drive structure formation, supersonic turbulence and
eventually, local star formation, does not seem to be sufficient to drive

questions: Upcoming generations of quantum computers might already be too large
to be simulated classically. Is it possible to experimentally test that these
systems perform as they should, if we cannot efficiently compute predictions
for their behavior? Vazirani has asked: If predicting Quantum Mechanical
systems requires exponential resources, is QM a falsifiable theory? In
cryptographic settings, an untrusted future company wants to sell a quantum
computer or perform a delegated quantum computation. Can the customer be
convinced of correctness without the ability to compare results to predictions?
  To answer these questions, we define Quantum Prover Interactive Proofs
(QPIP). Whereas in standard Interactive Proofs the prover is computationally
unbounded, here our prover is in BQP, representing a quantum computer. The
verifier models our current computational capabilities: it is a BPP machine,
with access to few qubits. Our main theorem can be roughly stated as: ""Any
language in BQP has a QPIP, and moreover, a fault tolerant one"". We provide two
proofs. The simpler one uses a new (possibly of independent interest) quantum
authentication scheme (QAS) based on random Clifford elements. This QPIP
however, is not fault tolerant. Our second protocol uses polynomial codes QAS
due to BCGHS, combined with quantum fault tolerance and multiparty quantum
computation techniques. A slight modification of our constructions makes the
protocol ""blind"": the quantum computation and input are unknown to the prover.
  After we have derived the results, we have learned that Broadbent at al. have
independently derived ""universal blind quantum computation"" using completely
different methods. Their construction implicitly implies similar implications.

coarse-graining physical energy scale $M$, under which we can trust the
effective field theory formulation. The prescription is successfully tested in
the calculation of the Lorentz invariance violating contributions arising from
the electron self-energy. Such radiative corrections turn out to be properly
scaled by very small factors for any reasonable values of the parameters and no
fine-tuning problems are found. Microcausality violations are highly suppressed

Here we show these naturally give rise to a bulk flow with correlation length
of order horizon size. The modification to the gravitational potential has a
characteristic scale $L_{1} \simeq 10^{3} H^{-1}$, and it originates from the
preinflationary remnants of the landscape. The 'tilt' in the potential induces
power to the lowest CMB multipoles, with the dominant contribution being the
dipole and next, the quadrupole. The induced multipoles $l \le 2$ are aligned
with an axis normal to their alignment plane being oriented along the preferred
frame determined by the dipole. The preferred direction is displayed by the
velocity field of the bulk flow relative to the expansion frame of the
universe. The parameters are tightly constrained thus the derived modifications
lead to robust predictions for testing our theory. The 'dark' flow was recently
discovered by Kashlinsky et al. to be about $700 km/s$ which seems in good
agreement with our predictions for the induced dipole of order $3 \mu K$.
Placed in this context, the discovery of the bulk flow by Kashlinsky et al.
becomes even more interesting as it may provide a probe of the preinflationary
physics and a window onto the landscape multiverse.

short-range correlations are almost independent of how monomers are connected
into polymers. Some limits of this idea are explored in the context of a
perturbation theory for mixtures of structurally identical polymer species, A
and B, in which the AB pair interaction differs slightly from the AA and BB
interaction, and the difference is controlled by a parameter alpha Expanding
the free energy to O(\alpha) yields an excess free energy of the form alpha
$z(N)\phi_{A}\phi_{B}$, in both lattice and continuum models, where z(N) is a
measure of the number of inter-molecular near neighbors of each monomer in a
one-component liquid. This quantity decreases slightly with increasing N
because the self-concentration of monomers from the same chain is slightly
higher for longer chains, creating a deeper correlation hole for longer chains.
We analyze the resulting $N$-dependence, and predict that $z(N) = z^{\infty}[1
+ \beta \bar{N}^{-1/2}]$, where $\bar{N}$ is an invariant degree of
polymerization, and $\beta=(6/\pi)^{3/2}$. This and other predictions are
confirmed by comparison to simulations. We also propose a way to estimate the
effective interaction parameter appropriate for comparisons of simulation data
to SCF theory and to coarse-grained theories of corrections to SCF theory,
which is based on an extrapolation of coefficients in this perturbation theory
to the limit $N \to \infty$. We show that a renormalized one-loop theory

the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of polymer liquids, and to the random
phase approximation (RPA) theory of composition fluctuations. We present
predictions of corrections to the RPA for the structure function $S(k)$ and to
the random walk model of single-chain statics in binary homopolymer blends. We
consider an apparent interaction parameter $\chi_{a}$ that is defined by
applying the RPA to the small $k$ limit of $S(k)$. The predicted deviation of
$\chi_{a}$ from its long chain limit is proportional to $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$
is chain length. This deviation is positive (i.e., destabilizing) for weakly
non-ideal mixtures, with $\chi_{a} N \alt 1$, but negative (stabilizing) near
the critical point. The positive correction to $\chi_{a}$ for low values of
$\chi_{a} N$ is a result of the fact that monomers in mixtures of shorter
chains are slightly less strongly shielded from intermolecular contacts. The
depression in $\chi_{a}$ near the critical point is a result of long-wavelength
composition fluctuations. The one-loop theory predicts a shift in the critical
temperature of ${\cal O}(N^{-1/2})$, which is much greater than the predicted
${\cal O}(N^{-1})$ width of the Ginzburg region. Chain dimensions deviate
slightly from those of a random walk even in a one-component melt, and contract
slightly with increasing $\chi_{e}$. Predictions for $S(k)$ and single-chain
properties are compared to published lattice Monte Carlo simulations.

measurements on spatially separated systems cannot always be described by a
locally causal theory. In such a theory, the outcomes of local measurements are
determined in advance solely by some unknown (or hidden) variables and the
choice of local measurements. Correlations that are allowed within the
framework of a locally causal theory are termed classical. Typically, the fact
that quantum mechanics does not always result in classical correlations is
revealed by the violation of Bell inequalities, which are constraints that have
to be satisfied by any classical correlations. It has been known for a long
time that entanglement is necessary to demonstrate nonclassical correlations,
and hence a Bell inequality violation. However, since some entangled quantum
states are known to admit explicit locally causal models, the exact role of
entanglement in Bell inequality violation has remained obscure. This thesis

evolution models to determine the bulge and clump masses, ages, star-formation

in clump cluster and chain galaxies have similar ages and 2 to 5 times larger
masses compared to the star-formation clumps, while the bulges in spirals have
~6 times larger ages and 20 to 30 times larger masses than the clumps. All

star-forming clumps are typically in a range from 10^7 to 10^8 Msun; their ages

redshift. Star formation is probably the result of gravitational instabilities
in the disk gas, in which case the large clump mass in the UDF is the result of
a high gas velocity dispersion, 30 km/s or more, combined with a high gas mass
column density, ~100 Msun/pc^2. Because clump clusters and chains dominate disk
galaxies beyond z~1, the observations suggest that these types represent an

crowding, cloud collisions, and gravitational instabilities. The characteristic
mass for the instability is 10^7 Msun in gas and 10^5 Msun in stars, and the
morphology is the familiar beads on a string with 1-2 kpc separation. Similar
instabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering
from stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances,
it occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during cloud
dispersal. For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery
of cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to
disentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case
has a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to
recognize. Turbulent triggering produces a hierarchy of dense cloudy structure
and an associated hierarchy of young star positions. There should also be a
correlation between the duration of star formation and the size of the region
that is analogous to the size-linewidth relation in the gas. The cosmological
context is provided by observations of star formation in high redshift
galaxies. Sequential and turbulent triggering is not yet observable, but
gravitational instabilities are, and they show a scale up from local
instabilities by a factor of ~3 in size and ~100 in mass. This is most easily
explained as the result of an increase in the ISM turbulent speed by a factor
of ~5. In the clumpiest galaxies at high redshift, the clumps are so large that
they should interact with each other and merge in the center, where they form
or contribute to the bulge.

but is not symmetric: it can be thought of as an asymmetric metric. The central
result of this thesis, developed in Chapter 3, is that a natural correspondence
exists between similarity measures between biological (nucleotide or protein)
sequences and quasi-metrics.
  Chapter 2 presents basic concepts of the theory of quasi-metric spaces and
introduces a new examples of them: the universal countable rational
quasi-metric space and its bicompletion, the universal bicomplete separable
quasi-metric space. Chapter 4 is dedicated to development of a notion of the
quasi-metric space with Borel probability measure, or pq-space. The main result
of this chapter indicates that `a high dimensional quasi-metric space is close
to being a metric space'.
  Chapter 5 investigates the geometric aspects of the theory of database
similarity search in the context of quasi-metrics. The results about
$pq$-spaces are used to produce novel theoretical bounds on performance of
indexing schemes.
  Finally, the thesis presents some biological applications. Chapter 6
introduces FSIndex, an indexing scheme that significantly accelerates
similarity searches of short protein fragment datasets. Chapter 7 presents the
prototype of the system for discovery of short functional protein motifs called
PFMFind, which relies on FSIndex for similarity searches.

the proximity to a phase separation instability in a bistable network of

formation of signaling domains during eukaryotic chemotaxis. In this case, the
process of domain growth may be described by the use of a constrained
time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg equation, admitting scale-invariant solutions
{\textit{\`a la}} Lifshitz and Slyozov. The constraint results here from a
mechanism of fast cycling of molecules between a cytosolic, inactive state and
a membrane-bound, active state, which dynamically tunes the chemical potential
for membrane binding to a value corresponding to the coexistence of different
phases on the cell membrane. We provide here a universal description of this
process both in the presence and absence of a gradient in the external
activation field. Universal power laws are derived for the time needed for the
cell to polarize in a chemotactic gradient, and for the value of the smallest
detectable gradient. We also describe a concrete realization of our scheme

ways including magnetic field compression. The CO J=4-3 distribution towards
peak C shows a compact and dense cloud core having a size of about 1 pc as well
as a broad wing. The core shows a notable anti-correlation with the Suzaku X

survived against the impact of the SN blast waves and is surrounded by high
energy electrons emitting the X ray. The TeV gamma ray distribution is, on the
other hand, more extended into the molecular gas, supporting the hadronic
origin of gamma ray production. W28 is one of the most outstanding star forming

the reason addressed in Phys. Rev. D 74 (2006) 121501 [astro-ph/0610483] (ref.
[1]) and subsequent published papers.
  Ref. [1] has not only modified the Einstein-Hilbert action but also has
changed the boundary conditions since they altered the equations of motion. In
Einstein-Hilbert action equations are second order, so the fall off of the
fields suffices to single out a unique solution. In 1/R gravity the equations
are fourth order, so we should impose additional boundary conditions. Perhaps
the boundary condition we must impose is that the abrupt change in the second
derivative of the metric near the surface of the Sun remains intact by adding
`1/R' corrections to the equations of motion. The solution of 1/R gravity with
this boundary condition remains consistent with the solar system tests.
  Ref. [1] assumes that as soon as they perturbatively modified the equations
then the Ricci scalar becomes smooth on the surface of the Sun. This assumption
is simply wrong because the boundary conditions and equations of motions are
two different entities.

investigate multi-Skyrmions in a theory which includes the omega vector meson

The results reveal a qualitative similarity with the standard Skyrme model with
a Skyrme term and no vector mesons, suggesting that some features are universal
and do not depend on the details of the theory. Setting the pion decay constant
and meson masses to their experimental values leaves only a single free
parameter in the model. Fixing this parameter, by equating the energy of the
baryon number four Skyrmion to the Helium-4 mass, yields reasonable results for
other baryon numbers.

uncertain. Aiming to address these issues, we have made millimeter
spectroscopic observations of the molecular gas toward the remnant. The
V_{LSR}~83--96 km/s molecular clouds (MCs) are found to overlap a large
north-western region of the remnant and are suggested to be located in front of
the SNR along the line of sight. Also in the remnant area, the V_{LSR}= 45--58
km/s MC shows a blue-shifted broadening in the 12CO (J=1-0) line profile and a
perturbed position-velocity structure near the edge of the remnant, with the
intensity centroid sitting in the northern area of the remnant. In particular,
a cavity surrounded by a molecular shell is unveiled in the intensity map in
the broadened blue wing (45--51 km/s), and the southern molecular shell follows
the bright partial SNR shell seen in X-rays, mid-infrared, and radio continuum.
These observational features provide effective evidences for the association of
Kes 75 with the adjacent 54 km/s MC. This association leads to a determination
of the kinematic distance at ~10.6 kpc to the remnant, which agrees with a
location at the far side of the Sagittarius arm. The morphological coincidence
of the shell seen in multiwavelengths is consistent with a scenario in which
the SNR shock hits a pre-existing dense shell. This dense molecular shell is
suggested to likely represent the debris of the cooled, clumpy shell of the
progenitor's wind bubble proximately behind the 54 km/s cloud. The discovery of
the association with MC provides a possible explanation for the gamma-ray
excess of the remnant.

Having in mind dimer-based quantum magnets in a field described by effective
bosonic models of this kind, we put special emphasis on a comparison between
the different cases of relative signs of the kinetic processes, which
correspond to unfrustrated or frustrated magnetic models. In the unfrustrated
case, we compare Quantum Monte Carlo simulations with a mean-field (classical)
approach, which is shown to give qualitatively correct results. Using this
classical approach for the frustrated case, we find that the phase diagram is
generically richer than in the unfrustrated case. We also investigate in detail
the differences between standard next-nearest neighbour and correlated hopping
over the diagonal, with the conclusion that both cases are similar if
checkerboard order is present at half-filling, while a supersolid phase can be
stabilized without any adjacent solid phase only in the case of correlated
hopping.

investigate the renormalization group (RG) flow of SUSY breaking terms as well

terms are suppressed in most regimes of the RG flow through the duality
cascade. At one stage of cascading, the gaugino mass of the strongly coupled
sector and scalar masses converge to certain values, which are determined by
the gauge coupling and the gaugino mass of the weakly coupled sector. At the
next stage, the strongly and weakly coupled sectors are interchanged with each

(the quoted `error' is one standard deviation). Hence we conclude that U is
essentially the same for all of the compounds studied. This shows that the
strong (hydrostatic and chemical) pressure dependence observed in the phase
diagrams of the BEDT-TTF salts is not due to U. Therefore, if the Hubbard model
is sufficient to describe the phase diagram of the BEDT-TTF salts there must be
significant pressure dependence on the intramolecular terms in the Hamiltonian
and/or the reduction of the Hubbard U due to the interaction of the molecule
with the polarisable crystal environment. The renormalised value of U is
significantly smaller than the bare value of the Coulomb integral:
F_0=5.2\pm0.1 eV across the same set of geometries, emphasising the importance
of using the renormalised value of U. The site energy (for holes), xi=5.0\pm0.2
eV, varies only a little more than U across the same set of geometries.
However, we argue that this plays a key role in understanding the role of
disorder in ET salts in general and in explaining the difference between the
beta_L and beta_H phases of beta-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 in particular.

  Heavy quarks were expected to lose less energy in the medium than light

However, the high transverse momentum non-photonic electron spectra, which are

all temperatures T, the relaxation is slower than exponential. Analyzing the
energy correlations of the system at equilibrium, we find a stretched

drawbacks in the description of the lower energy channels. Our results imply

transition from a compact corona in the first observation to the disappearance

but typically moderately to strongly triaxial systems. We investigate methods
to convert spherical potential-density pairs into axisymmetric ones, in which
the basic characteristics of the density profile (such as the slope at small
and large radii) are retained. We achieve this goal by replacing the spherical
radius r by an oblate radius m in the expression of the gravitational
potential.
  We extend and formalize the approach pioneered by Miyamoto & Nagai (1975) to
be applicable to arbitrary potential-density pairs. Unfortunately, an
asymptotic study demonstrates that, at large radii, such models always show a
R^(-3) disc superposed on a smooth roughly spherical density distribution. As a
result, this recipe cannot be used to construct simple flattened
potential-density pairs for dynamical systems such as dark matter haloes.
Therefore we apply a modification of our original recipe that cures the problem
of the discy behaviour. An asymptotic analysis now shows that the density
distribution has the desired asymptotic behaviour at large radii (if the
density falls less rapidly than r^(-4)). We also show that the flattening
procedure does not alter the shape of the density distribution at small radii:
while the inner density contours are flattened, the slope of the density
profile is unaltered.
  We apply this recipe to construct a set of flattened dark matter haloes based
on the realistic spherical halo models by Dehnen & McLaughlin (2005). This
example illustrates that the method works fine for modest flattening values,
whereas stronger flattening values lead to peanut-shaped density distributions.

to the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also
viewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its
transition probability vector in terms of the feedbacks of all data points, and
then its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function.
Finally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space,
data points collect gradually and some separating parts emerge among them
automatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are
located at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are
away from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated
that data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently,
and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

varying coefficients is a recurrent problem shared by a number of scientific
and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When
formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an
elegant setting to built up approximate exponential representations of the
solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the
corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent
Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in
Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the
important additional property of preserving at any order certain symmetries of
the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a
number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific
literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of
terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series,
generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a
bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical
integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third,
to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus
expansion in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard
numerical integrators. We buttress this issue with a revision of the wide range
of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature.

Kahan, who applied it to the two-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system.

associated with pairs of Lie-Poisson algebras in three dimensions, as presented

obtained are also bi-Hamiltonian, with pairs of compatible Poisson brackets
that are one-parameter deformations of the original Lie-Poisson algebras, and
hence they are completely integrable. For comparison, we also present analogous
discretizations for three bi-Hamiltonian systems that have a transcendental

dynamics where, in this study, we focus on the effects of viscous instabilities
influenced by boundary effects. The Boussinesq approximation of the viscous
large shearing box equations is analyzed in which the azimuthal length scale of
the disturbance is much larger than the radial and vertical scales. We examine
the stability of a non-axisymmetric potential vorticity mode, i.e. a
PV-anomaly. in a configuration in which buoyant convection and the
strato-rotational instability do not to operate. We consider a series of
boundary conditions which show the PV-anomaly to be unstable both on a finite
and semi-infinite radial domains. We find these conditions leading to an
instability which is the disk analog of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. When the
viscosity is weak, evidence of the instability is most pronounced by the
emergence of a vortex sheet at the critical layer located away from the
boundary where the instability is generated. For some boundary conditions a
necessary criterion for the onset of instability for vertical wavelengths that
are a sizable fraction of the layer's thickness and when the viscosity is small
is that the appropriate Froude number of the flow be greater than one. This
instability persists if more realistic boundary conditions are applied,
although the criterion on the Froude number is more complicated. The unstable
waves studied here share qualitative features to the instability seen in
rotating Blasius boundary layers. The implications of these results are
discussed. An overall new strategy for exploring and interpreting disk
instability mechanisms is also suggested.

the description of bound states within quantum field theory is the Salpeter
equation, found as the instantaneous limit of the Bethe-Salpeter framework if
allowing, in addition, for free propagation of the bound-state constituents.
Unfortunately, depending on the Lorentz nature of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel,
supposedly stable results of Salpeter's equation with confining interactions
exhibit (un-)expected instabilities, probably related to Klein's paradox.
Clearly, bound states may be regarded as stable if, for appropriate
interactions, their mass eigenvalues belong to a real and discrete (part of
the) spectrum that is bounded from below. Some general features of the
eigenvalue spectra of any Salpeter equation are well-established: all
bound-state masses squared are real and, for a large class of sufficiently
reasonable Bethe-Salpeter kernels - which includes all interactions of
phenomenological relevance for QCD -, the spectrum of mass eigenvalues
consists, in the complex bound-state mass plane, at most of real pairs of
opposite sign and imaginary points. For time-component vector
harmonic-oscillator kernels, a straightforward stability proof is given.

interacts with the ordinary photon via gauge kinetic mixing, leading to photon
- hidden photon oscillations. In this framework, one expects photon
disappearance as a function of the mass of the hidden photon and the mixing
angle, loosely constrained from theory. Several experiments have been carried
out or are planned to constrain the mass-mixing plane.
  In this contribution we derive new constraints on the hidden photon
parameters, using very high energy gamma-rays detected from the Crab Nebula,
whose broad-band spectral characteristics are well understood. The very high
energy gamma-ray observations offer the possibility to provide bounds in a
broad mass range at a previously unexplored energy and distance scale. Using
existing data that were taken with several Cherenkov telescopes, we discuss our
results in the context of current constraints and consider the possibilities of

charged and neutral kaons. For energies below the superconducting gap, the
kaons are described by an $O(2)\times O(2)$-symmetric effective scalar field

asteroid impact could potentially kill more than a billion people.
Comfortingly, scientific calculations often put very low probabilities on the
occurrence of such catastrophes. In this paper, we argue that there are
important new methodological problems which arise when assessing global
catastrophic risks and we focus on a problem regarding probability estimation.
When an expert provides a calculation of the probability of an outcome, they
are really providing the probability of the outcome occurring, given that their
argument is watertight. However, their argument may fail for a number of
reasons such as a flaw in the underlying theory, a flaw in the modeling of the
problem, or a mistake in the calculations. If the probability estimate given by
an argument is dwarfed by the chance that the argument itself is flawed, then
the estimate is suspect. We develop this idea formally, explaining how it
differs from the related distinctions of model and parameter uncertainty. Using
the risk estimates from the Large Hadron Collider as a test case, we show how
serious the problem can be when it comes to catastrophic risks and how best to
address it.

voters rather than the population as a whole. This leads to sampling error
which most polling agencies dutifully report. But factors such as
nonrepresentative samples, question wording and nonresponse can produce
non-sampling errors. While pollsters are aware of such errors, they are
difficult to quantify and seldom reported. When a polling agency, whether by
intention or not, produces results with non-sampling errors that systematically
favor one candidate over another, then that agency's poll is biased. We
analyzed polling data for the (on-going) 2008 Presidential race, and though our
methods do not allow us to identify which agencies' polls are biased, they do
provide significant evidence that some agencies' polls are.
  We compared polls produced by major television networks with those produced
by Gallup and Rasmussen. We found that, taken as a whole, polls produced by the
networks were significantly to the left of those produced by Gallup and
Rasmussen. We used the available data to provide a tentative ordering of the
major television networks' polls from right to left. Our order was: FOX, CNN,
NBC (which partners with the Wall Street Journal), ABC (which partners with the
Washington Post), CBS (which partners with the New York Times). These results
appear to comport well with the informal perceptions of the political leanings
of these agencies.
