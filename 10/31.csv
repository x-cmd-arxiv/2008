behave asymptotically as $\delta(t) \approx A(\kappa |t-t_0|)^{1/2}$, where
$\kappa=h/m$ is the quantum of circulation. The major finding of the
experiments and their analysis is strong support for this asymptotic form with
$\kappa$ as the dominant controlling feature, although there are significant
event to event fluctuations. At the three-parameter level the dynamics may be
about equally well-fit by two modified expressions: (a) an arbitrary power-law
expression of the form $\delta(t)=B|t-t_0|^{\alpha}$ and (b) a
correction-factor expression $\delta(t)=A(\kappa|t-t_0|)^{1/2}(1+c|t-t_0|)$. In
light of possible physical interpretations we regard the correction-factor
expression (b), which attributes the observed deviations from the predicted
asymptotic form to fluctuations in the local environment and in boundary

appear statistically time-reversible, which suggests that an effective
equilibrium has been established in quantum turbulence on the time scales

Given a family of arcs $F$ on the circle, the circular cover number $L(F)$ is

both these systems in their quiescent states and detect the strong pulsations
modes reported by previous authors. The identification of further periodicities
in GW Lib is limited by the accretion-driven flickering of the source, but in
the case of SDSS 1610 we identify several additional low-amplitude
periodicities. In the case of SDSS 1610, there is evidence to suggest that the
two primary signals have a different colour dependence, suggesting that they
may be different spherical harmonic modes. We additionally observed GW Lib
during several epochs following its 2007 dwarf nova outburst: the first time a
dwarf nova containing a pulsating white dwarf has been observed in such a
state. We do not observe any periodicities, suggesting that the heating of the
white dwarf had either switched-off the pulsations entirely, or reduced their
relative amplitude in flux to the point where they are undetectable. Further
observations eleven months after the outburst still do not show the pulsation
modes previously observed, but do show the emergence of two new periodic
signals. In addition to the WD pulsations, our observations of GW Lib in
quiescence show a larger-amplitude modulation in luminosity with a period of
approximately 2.1 hours. This has been previously observed, and its origin is
unclear: it is unrelated to the orbital period. We find this modulation to vary
over the course of our observations in phase and/or period. Our data support
the conclusion that this is an accretion-related phenomenon which originates in
the accretion disc.

Sitter backgrounds subject to the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The
GUP arises in several contexts in string theory, but is most readily thought of
as resulting from using strings as effective probes of geometry, which suggests
an uncertainty relation incorporating the string scale $l_s$. After reviewing
the string theoretic case for the GUP, which implies a minimum length scale
$l_s$, we follow in the footsteps of Kempf and concern ourselves with how one
might write down field theories which respect the GUP. We uncover a new
representation of the GUP, which unlike previous studies, readily permits exact
analytical solutions for the mode functions of a scalar field on de Sitter
backgrounds. We find that scalar fields cannot be quantized on inflationary
backgrounds with a Hubble radius $H^{-1}$ smaller than the string scale,
implying a sensibly stringy (as opposed to Planckian) cutoff on the scale of
inflation resulting from the GUP. We also compute $(H l_s)^2$ corrections to
the two point correlation function analytically and comment on the future
prospects of observing such corrections in the fortunate circumstance our
universe is described by a very weakly coupled string theory.

two eigenmodes. When only hard-core and short-range overall attractive

one-component systems. Criticality occurs on a locus terminating a coexistence
surface; however, except at some special points, an unexpected
``demagnetization effect'' suppresses the normal divergence of susceptibilities
at criticality and distorts two-phase coexistence. This effect, unphysical for

requires that the cosmological luminosity distance be larger than the angular
diameter distance by a factor of $(1+z)^2$, where $z$ is the redshift. Because
this is a fundamental symmetry, this prediction--known sometimes as the
""Etherington relation"" or the ""Tolman test""--is independent of world model, or
even the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. It depends, however, on
Lorentz invariance and transparency. Transparency can be affected by
intergalactic dust or interactions between photons and the dark sector. Baryon
acoustic feature and type Ia supernovae measures of the expansion history are
differently sensitive to the angular diameter and luminosity distances and can
therefore be used in conjunction to limit cosmic transparency. At the present
day, the comparison only limits the change $\Delta\tau$ in the optical depth
from redshift 0.20 to 0.35 at visible wavelengths to $\Delta\tau < 0.13$ at 95%
confidence. In a model with a constant comoving number density $n$ of
scatterers of constant proper cross-section $\sigma$, this limit implies $n

cosmological world model. Within the next few years, the limits could extend to
redshifts $z\approx2.5$ and improve to $n \sigma<1.1 \times10^{-5} h

recent studies, carried out by means of dedicated simulations of black hole

ingredients that are crucial in every massive black hole formation scenario,
namely: (i) the nature and abundance of the first black hole seeds and (ii) the
large gravitational recoils following the merger of highly spinning black
holes. We predict LISA detection rates spanning two order of magnitude, in the
range 3-300 events per year, depending on the detail of the assumed massive
black hole seed model. On the other hand, large recoil velocities do not
dramatically compromise the efficiency of LISA observations. The number of
detections may drop substantially (by ~60%), in scenarios characterized
byabundant light seeds, but if seeds are already massive and/or relatively
rare, the detection rate is basically unaffected.

accounting for the effects of relativistic beaming, such short timescales are
challenging simple and conventional emitting models, and call for alternative
ideas. We explore the possibility that extremely fast variable emission might
be produced by particles streaming at ultra-relativistic speeds along magnetic
field lines and inverse Compton scattering any radiation field already present.
This would produce extremely collimated beams of TeV photons. While the
probability for the line of sight to be within such a narrow cone of emission
would be negligibly small, one would expect that the process is not confined to
a single site, but can take place in many very localised regions, along almost
straight magnetic lines. A possible astrophysical setting realising these
conditions is magneto-centrifugal acceleration of beams of particles. In this
scenario, the variability timescale would not be related to the physical
dimension of the emitting volume, but might be determined by either the typical
duration of the process responsible for the production of these high energy
particle beams or by the coherence length of the magnetic field. It is
predicted that even faster TeV variability - with no X-ray counterpart - should
be observed by the foreseen more sensitive Cerenkov telescopes.

continuum pumping in the hydrogen Lyman transitions. In the environments where
these transitions are optically thick, deexcitation occurs through higher
series lines, so that the flux in these lines has a fluorescent contribution in
addition to recombination; in particular, Balmer emissivities are
systematically enhanced above case B. The effectiveness of such mechanism in
HII regions and the adequacy of photoionization models as a tool to study it
are the two main focuses of this work. We find that photoionization models of H
II regions illuminated by low-resolution population synthesis models
significantly overpredict the fluorescent contribution to the Balmer lines.
Conversely, photoionization models in which the non-ionizing part of the
continuum is omitted or is not transferred underpredict the fluorescent
contribution to the Balmer lines, producing a bias of similar amplitude in the
opposite direction. In this paper, we carry out realistic estimations of the
fluorescent Balmer intensity and discuss the variations to be expected as the
simulated observational setup and the stellar population's parameters are
varied. In all the cases explored, we find that fluorescent excitation provides
a significant contribution. We also show that differential fluorescent
enhancement may produce line-of-sight differences in the Balmer decrement,
mimicking interstellar extinction. Fluorescent excitation emerges from our
study as a small but important mechanism for the enhancement of Balmer lines,
which should be taken into account in the abundance analysis of photoionized
regions, particularly in the case of high-precision applications such as the
determination of primordial helium.

sample is drawn from two 1-degree fields, one centred on the cluster core and
the other located a degree to the south west of the cluster centre. For a
comparison sample we use published high-S/N data for red-sequence galaxies in
the Shapley Supercluster. We use state-of-the-art stellar population models to
infer the SSP-equivalent age and metallicity (Fe/H) for each galaxy, as well as
the abundances of the light elements Mg, Ca, C and N. The ages of the Coma
dwarfs span a wide range from <2 Gyr to >10 Gyr, with a strong environmental
dependence. The oldest galaxies are found only in the core, while most of the
galaxies in the outer south-west field have ages ~3 Gyr. The galaxies have a
metallicity range -1.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.0, and follow the same age-metallicity-mass
plane as high-mass galaxies, but with increased intrinsic scatter. The Mg/Fe
abundance ratios are on average slightly super-solar, and span a range -0.1 <
[Mg/Fe] < +0.4. The highest Mg enhancements are found only in the cluster core,
while solar ratios predominate in the outskirts. Depending on the assumed
star-formation history (quenched versus burst-dominated), the number of dwarf
galaxies on the red sequence in the Coma core has doubled since z~0.4-0.7.
These estimates bracket the red-sequence growth timescales found by direct
studies of distant clusters. In the south-west field, the red sequence was
established only at z~0.1-0.2. Our observations confirm previous indications of
very recently quenched star formation in this part of the cluster. Our results
support the picture in which much of the cluster passive dwarf population was
generated by environment-driven transformation of infalling late-type galaxies.

particles, whose positions are shifted from that of the original particle by
independently performing two random walk steps according to the distribution $p
\delta_{1} + (1-p) \delta_{0}$, from the location of the original particle.
During the selection step that follows, only the N rightmost particles are kept
among the 2N particles obtained at the branching step, to form a new population
of $N$ particles. After a large number of iterated branching-selection steps,
the displacement of the whole population of $N$ particles is ballistic, with
deterministic asymptotic speed $v_{N}(p)$. As $N$ goes to infinity, $v_{N}(p)$
converges to a finite limit $v_{\infty}(p)$. The main result is that, for every

$v_{\infty}(p)- v_{N}(p)$ is $\log(N)^{-2}$. This is called Brunet-Derrida

effect on the structural modifications of beta-irradiated glasses. The data
obtained by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy indicated that
relative amount of Gd3+ ions located in network former position reveals
non-linear dependence on Sm/Gd ratio. Besides, codoping leads to the evolution
of the EPR signal attributed to defects created by irradiation: superhyperfine
structure of boron oxygen hole centres EPR line becomes less noticeable and
resolved with increase of Gd amount. This fact manifests that Gd3+ ions are
mainly diluted in vicinity of the boron network. By Raman spectroscopy, we
showed that the structural changes induced by the irradiation also reveal
non-linear behaviour with Sm/Gd ratio. In fact, the shift of the Si-O-Si
bending vibration modes has a clear minimum for the samples containing equal
amount of Sm and Gd (50:50) in both series of the investigated glasses. In
contrast, for single doped glass there is no influence of dopant's content on
Si-O-Si shift (in case of Gd) or its diminution (in case of Sm) occurs which is
explained by the reduction process influence. At the same time, no noticeable
effect of codoping on Sm3+ intensity as well as on Sm2+ emission or on Sm

the transverse momentum pT due to radiation from the initial state. We show
that the endpoint functions MT2{max}(n,p,c)(Mc,pT) may exhibit three different
types of kinks and discuss the origin of each type. We prove that the subsystem
MT2(n,p,c) variables by themselves already yield a sufficient number of
measurements for a complete determination of the mass spectrum (including the
overall mass scale). As an illustration, we consider the simple case of a decay
chain with up to three heavy particles, X2 -> X1 -> X0, which is rather
problematic for all other mass measurement methods. We propose three different
MT2-based methods, each of which allows a complete determination of the masses
of particles X0, X1 and X2. The first method only uses MT2(n,p,c) endpoint
measurements at a single fixed value of the test mass Mc. In the second method
the unknown mass spectrum is fitted to one or more endpoint functions
MT2{max}(n,p,c)(Mc,pT) exhibiting a kink. The third method is hybrid, combining
MT2 endpoints with measurements of kinematic edges in invariant mass
distributions. As a practical application of our methods, we show that the
dilepton W+W- and tt-bar samples at the Tevatron can be used for an independent
determination of the masses of the top quark, the W boson and the neutrino,
without any prior assumptions.

the lattice-gas model and the classical Bragg-Williams (BWA) and quasi-chemical

extension of the well-known Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) isotherm to more
complex systems. The formalism reproduces the classical theory for monomers,
leads to the exact statistical thermodynamics of interacting k-mers adsorbed in
one dimension, and provides a close approximation for two-dimensional systems
accounting multisite occupancy and lateral interactions in the first layer.
Comparisons between analytical data and Monte Carlo simulations were performed
in order to test the validity of the theoretical model. The study showed that:
(i) the resulting thermodynamic description obtained from QCA is significantly
better than that obtained from BWA and still mathematically handable; (ii) for
non-interacting k-mers, the BET equation leads to an underestimate of the true
monolayer volume; (iii) attractive lateral interactions compensate the effect
of the multisite occupancy and the monolayer volume predicted by BET equation
agrees very well with the corresponding true value; and (iv) repulsive
couplings between the admolecules hamper the formation of the monolayer and the
BET results are not good (even worse than those obtained in the non-interacting
case).

~1"", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened star
formation rate of 22 Msolar per year. Based on H-alpha kinematics we find that
these six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them as
either merger or disk candidate systems. We find three merger systems
(HDF-BX1287, HDF-BX1315, and Q1623-BX491) with varying geometries and dynamical
properties. Three galaxies (HDF-BMZ1299, Q2343-BX344, and Q2343-BM145) are
well-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46
km/sec). An average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0
kpc. The majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can be
explained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources.
However, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (>
200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing. For two disk
candidates, we detect [NII] emission and are able to map the [NII]/H-alpha
ratio on kiloparsec scales. In both cases, [NII] emission is more concentrated
than H-alpha emission (< 0.2""), and peak ratios are best explained by the
presence of an AGN. These are among the weakest known AGN at high redshift,
however their emission is strong enough to impact high redshift metallicity
studies that use nebular ratios. All disk candidates have likely completed only
a few orbital periods, and if left unperturbed are excellent candidates to
become present-day spiral galaxies.

distribution. It is shown that the limiting distribution can be given by the
absolute square of the Fourier transform of $L^2$ function whose support
belongs to $[-1,1]$. Using this relation, we study the relation between the
variance of the limiting distribution and its tail probability. As our result,
we prove that the protocol minimizing the asymptotic variance does not minimize
the tail probability. Depending on the width of interval, we derive the
estimation protocol minimizing the tail probability out of a given interval.
Such an optimal protocol is given by a prolate spheroidal wave function which
often appears in wavelet or time-limited Fourier analysis. Also, the minimum
confidence interval is derived with the framework of interval estimation that
assures a given confidence coefficient.

photoelectric yield model by Weingartner et al. (2006) and the dust size
distribution in the Milky Way by Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck (1977). This
heating rate dominates the HI and HeII photoionization heating rates when the
hydrogen number density is less than $\sim10^{-6}$ cm$^{-3}$ if ${\cal
D}=10^{-4}$ which is 1% of that in the Milky Way, although the heating rate is
a factor of 2--4 smaller than that with the old yield model by Weingartner &
Draine (2001). The grain size distribution is very important. If only large
($\ge0.1$ $\mu$m) grains exist in the IGM, the heating rate is reduced by a
factor of $\simeq5$. Since the dust heating is more efficient in a lower
density medium relative to the photoionization heating, it may cause an
inverted temperature--density relation in the low density IGM suggested by
Bolton et al. (2008). Finally, we have found that the dust heating is not very

$P \sim a^{d_H}$ where $a$ is the loop diameter. Solving the 3D Fokker-Planck
equation for the loop response at frequency $\omega $ yields a superfluid
density which varies at $T_{\lambda}$ as $\omega^{1/(d_H -1)}$. This power-law
variation with $\omega$ agrees with the scaling form found by Fisher, Fisher,
and Huse, since the dynamic exponent $z$ is identified as $z = d_H-1$. Flory
scaling for the self-avoiding loops gives a fractal dimension in terms of the
space dimension $d$ as $d_H = (d+2)/2$, yielding $z = d/2 = 3/2$ for d = 3, in
complete agreement with dynamic scaling.

arising from the very small diameter of the nanotubes. Calculations show that
surface tension keeps the film thickness on the tubes very thin even when the
helium vapor is increased to the saturated pressure. The weakened Van der Waals
force due to the cylindrical geometry also contributes to this. Both of these
effects act to lower the predicted velocity of third sound propagation along
the tubes. It does not appear that superfluidity will be possible on
single-walled nanotubes of diameter about one nm, since the film thickness is
less than 3 atomic layers even at saturation. Superfluidity is possible on
larger-diameter nanotube bundles and multi-walled nanotubes, however. We have
observed third sound signals on nanotube bundles of average diameter 5 nm which
are sprayed onto a Plexiglass surface, forming a network of tubes.

Therefore, we synthesize previously published Submillimeter Array

high-mass star formation that are in various evolutionary stages with a range
of luminosities. Estimating column densities and comparing the spatially
resolved molecular emission allows us to characterize the chemical evolution in
more detail. Furthermore, we model the chemical evolution of massive warm
molecular cores to be directly compared with the data. The four regions reveal
many different characteristics. While some of them, e.g., the detection rate of
CH3OH, can be explained by variations of the average gas temperatures, other
features are attributed to chemical effects. For example, C34S is observed
mainly at the core-edges and not toward their centers because of
temperature-selective desorption and successive gas-phase chemistry reactions.
Most nitrogen-bearing molecules are only found toward the hot molecular cores
and not the earlier evolutionary stages, indicating that the formation and
excitation of such complex nitrogen-bearing molecules needs significant heating
and time to be fully developed. Furthermore, we discuss the observational
difficulties to study massive accretion disks in the young deeply embedded
phase of massive star formation. The general potential and limitations of such

integers DT^a(t) which count stable sheaves with Chern character a on X, with
respect to a Gieseker stability condition t. They are defined only for Chern
characters a for which there are no strictly semistable sheaves on X. They have
the good property that they are unchanged under deformations of X. Their
behaviour under change of stability condition t was not understood until now.
  This book defines and studies a generalization of Donaldson-Thomas
invariants. Our new invariants \bar{DT}^a(t) are rational numbers, defined for
all Chern characters a, and are equal to DT^a(t) if there are no strictly
semistable sheaves in class a. They are deformation-invariant, and have a known
transformation law under change of stability condition.
  To prove all this we study the local structure of the moduli stack M of
coherent sheaves on X. We show that an atlas for M may be written locally as
Crit(f) for f a holomorphic function on a complex manifold, and use this to
deduce identities on the Behrend function of M.
  We compute our invariants in examples, and make a conjecture about their
integrality properties. We extend the theory to abelian categories of
representations of a quiver with relations coming from a superpotential, and
connect our ideas with Szendroi's ""noncommutative Donaldson-Thomas invariants""

constant term of a characteristic polynomial. For matrices over an abstract
ring, by the results of Baur and Strassen, the determinant algorithm, actually
a straight-line program, leads to an algorithm with the same complexity for
computing the adjoint of a matrix. However, the latter adjoint algorithm is
obtained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation, hence somehow is not
""explicit"". We present an alternative (still closely related) algorithm for the
adjoint thatcan be implemented directly, we mean without resorting to an
automatic transformation. The algorithm is deduced by applying program
differentiation techniques ""by hand"" to Kaltofen's method, and is completely
decribed. As subproblem, we study the differentiation of programs that compute
minimum polynomials of lineraly generated sequences, and we use a lazy
polynomial evaluation mechanism for reducing the cost of Strassen's avoidance
of divisions in our case.

costs one must pay for the $f(R)$ models that allow for neutrons stars: (i) the
leading correction must be fine-tuned to have the typical energy scale $\mu

relativistic star; (ii) the leading correction must be further fine-tuned so
that it is not given by the quadratic curvature term. The second problem is
caused because there appears an intermediate curvature scale and laboratory
experiments of gravity will be under the influence of higher curvature
corrections. Our analysis thus implies that it is a challenge to construct
viable $f(R)$ models without very careful and unnatural fine-tuning.

range of interest, molecules represent the dominant opacity source. Our dataset
covers a wide metallicity range and is meant to provide important input data
for stellar evolution models and other applications. We conduct chemical
equilibrium calculations to evaluate the partial pressures of neutral atoms,
ions, and molecules. Based on a large dataset containing atomic line and
continuum data and, most importantly, a plethora of molecular lines, we
calculate Rosseland mean opacity coefficients not only for a number of
different metallicities, but also for varied abundances of the isotopes ^{12}C
and ^{14}N at each metallicity. The molecular data comprise the main opacity
sources for either an oxygen-rich or carbon-rich chemistry. We tabulate the
opacity coefficients as a function of temperature and, basically, density. Due
to the special role of the CO molecule, within a certain chemistry regime an
alteration to the carbon abundance causes considerable changes in the Rosseland
opacity. The transition from a scaled solar (i. e. oxygen-rich) mixture to a
carbon-rich regime results in opacities that can, at low temperatures, differ
by orders of magnitude from to the initial situation. The reason is that the
mean opacity in either case is due to different molecular absorbers. Variations

photometric observations of the southern 2Jy sample of powerful radio sources

radio jet, AGN, starburst activity and MFIR properties. This is part of an
ongoing extensive study of powerful radio galaxies that benefits from both
complete optical emission line information and a uniquely high detection rate
in the far-infrared (far-IR). We find tight correlations between the MFIR and
[OIII] emission luminosities, which are significantly better than those between
MFIR and extended radio luminosities, or between radio and [OIII] luminosities.
Since [OIII] is a known indicator of intrinsic AGN power, these correlations
confirm AGN illumination of the circum-nuclear dust as the primary heating
mechanism for the dust producing thermal MFIR emission at both 24 and 70
microns. We demonstrate that AGN heating is energetically feasible, and
identify the narrow line region clouds as the most likely location of the cool,
far-IR emitting dust. Starbursts make a major contribution to the heating of
the cool dust in only 15-28% of our targets.
  We also investigate the orientation dependence of the continuum properties,
finding that the broad- and narrow-line objects in our sample with strong
emission lines have similar distributions of MFIR luminosities and colours.
Therefore our results are entirely consistent with the orientation-based
unified schemes for powerful radio galaxies. However, the weak line radio
galaxies (WLRG) form a separate class of objects with intrinsically low
luminosity AGN in which both the optical emission lines and the MFIR continuum
are weak.

stands (remnants of past forest overexploitation) and artificial stands planted
from the 1940's. The genetic makeup of the artificially regenerated forest is
of some concern. The use of reproductive material with uncontrolled origin or
from a reduced number of parental trees may produce stands ill adapted to local
conditions or unable to adapt in response to environmental change. The genetic
diversity within a transect of reforested stands connecting two natural forest
fragments has been studied with nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. Little
genetic differentiation and similar levels of genetic diversity to the
surrounding natural stands were found for nuclear markers. However, chloroplast
microsatellites presented lower haplotype diversity in reforested stands, and
this may be a consequence of the lower effective population size of the
chloroplast genome, meaning chloroplast markers have a higher sensitivity to
bottlenecks. Understory natural regeneration within the reforestation was also
analysed to study gene flow from natural forest into artificial stands.
Estimates of immigration rate into artificially regenerated forest were high
(0.68-0.75), producing a significant increase of genetic diversity (both in
chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites), which indicates the capacity for
genetic recovery for P. canariensis reforestations surrounded by larger natural

(APLC), is combining an apodizer in the entrance aperture and a Lyot opaque
mask in the focal plane. This paper presents the manufacturing and tests of a
microdots apodizer optimized for the near IR.
  The intent of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of
binary apodizers for the APLC. This study is also relevant for any coronagraph
using amplitude pupil apodization.
  A binary apodizer has been designed using a halftone dot process, where the
binary array of pixels with either 0% or 100% transmission is calculated to fit
the required continuous transmission, i.e. local transmission control is
obtained by varying the relative density of the opaque and transparent pixels.
An error diffusion algorithm was used to optimize the distribution of pixels
that best approximates the required field transmission. The prototype was
tested with a coronagraphic setup in the near IR.
  The transmission profile of the prototype agrees with the theoretical shape
within 3% and is achromatic. The observed apodized and coronagraphic images are
consistent with theory. However, binary apodizers introduce high frequency
noise that is a function of the pixel size. Numerical simulations were used to
specify pixel size in order to minimize this effect, and validated by
experiment.
  This paper demonstrates that binary apodizers are well suited for being used
in high contrast imaging coronagraphs. The correct choice of pixel size is
important and must be adressed considering the scientific field of view.

value of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ very close to zero, or make it vanish.
On the other hand, starting from $\theta_{13}=0$ at the high scale it may be
possible to generate a non-zero $\theta_{13}$ radiatively. In the most general
scenario with non-vanishing CP violating Dirac and Majorana phases, we explore
the evolution in the vicinity of $\theta_{13}=0$, in terms of its structure in
the complex ${\cal U}_{e3}$ plane. This allows us to explain the apparent
singularity in the evolution of the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ at $\theta_{13}=0$.
We also introduce a formalism for calculating the RG evolution of neutrino
parameters that uses the Jarlskog invariant and naturally avoids this singular
behaviour. We find that the parameters need to be extremely fine-tuned in order
to get exactly vanishing $\theta_{13}$ during evolution. For the class of
neutrino mass models with $\theta_{13}=0$ at the high scale, we calculate the
extent to which RG evolution can generate a nonzero $\theta_{13}$, when the low
energy effective theory is the standard model or its minimal supersymmetric
extension. We find correlated constraints on $\theta_{13}$, the lightest

allowed. The dynamics are T=0 asymmetric Glauber dynamics driven out of rest by
an injection mechanism, namely a Poissonian flipping of one spin. The drift
induces anisotropy in the system, making the model more comparable to
experimental systems with dissipative structures. We discuss the physical

injection process and the magnitude of the drift on the properties of the ldf.

molecules by a two-color photoassociation experiment. We compare the results
with those for Rb_2 in order to understand the characteristic differences
between heteronuclear and homonuclear molecules. The major differences arise
from the different long-range potential for excited states. Ultracold 85Rb and
133Cs atoms colliding on the X^1Sigma+ potential curve are initially
photoassociated to form excited RbCs molecules in the region below the Rb(5S) +
Cs(6P_1/2) asymptote. We explore the nature of the Omega=0^+ levels in this
region, which have mixed A^1Sigma^+ and b^3Pi character. We then study the
quantum dynamics of RbCs by a time-dependent wavepacket (TDWP) approach. A
wavepacket is formed by exciting a few vibronic levels and is allowed to
propagate on the coupled electronic potential energy curves. For a detuning of
7.5 cm-1, the wavepacket for RbCs reaches the short-range region in about 13
ps, which is significantly faster than for the homonuclear Rb_2 system; this is
mostly because of the absence of an R^-3 long-range tail in the excited-state
potential curves for heteronuclear systems. We give a simple semiclassical
formula that relates the time taken to the long-range potential parameters. For
RbCs, in contrast to Rb_2, the excited-state wavepacket shows a substantial
peak in singlet density near the inner turning point, and this produces a
significant probability of deexcitation to form ground-state molecules bound by
up to 1500 cm-1. Our analysis of the role of spin-orbit coupling concerns the
character of the mixed states in general and is important for both
photoassociation and stimulated Raman deexcitation.

with little/no blue bump. It thus seems that near-IR color selection isolates
the reddest subset of AGN that can be classified optically. The shape of the
SEDs is generally consistent with modest absorption by gas (in the X-ray) and
dust (in the optical-IR). The levels of obscuration, estimated from X-rays,
far-IR and our detailed optical/near-IR color modeling are all consistent
implying N_H < few*10^{22} cm^{-2}. We present SED models that show how the AGN
optical/near-IR colors change due to differing amounts of reddening, AGN to
host galaxy ratio, redshift and scattered light emission and apply them to the

lesser extent the near-IR color, J-K$_S$, are strongly affected by reddening,
host galaxy emission, redshift, and in few, highly polarized objects, also by
scattered AGN light. The obscuration/inclination of the AGN allows us to see
weaker emission components which are generally swamped by the AGN.

some $q$ with $1<q<2$ implies its validity (with another constant) for all
$1\le p<q$. We prove this for the inequality involving the Rademacher
functions, but also for more general ""lacunary"" sequences, or even
non-commutative analogues of the Rademacher functions. For instance, we may
apply it to the ""Z(2)-sequences"" previously considered by Harcharras. The
result appears to be new in that case. It implies that the space $\ell^n_1$
contains (as an operator space) a large subspace uniformly isomorphic (as an
operator space) to $R_k+C_k$ with $k\sim n^{\frac12}$. This naturally raises
several interesting questions concerning the best possible such $k$.
Unfortunately we cannot settle the validity of the non-commutative Khintchine
inequality for $0<p<1$ but we can prove several would be corollaries. For
instance, given an infinite scalar matrix $[x_{ij}]$, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for $[\pm x_{ij}]$ to be in the Schatten class $S_p$ for
almost all (independent) choices of signs $\pm 1$. We also characterize the
bounded Schur multipliers from $S_2$ to $S_p$. The latter two characterizations
extend to $0<p<1$ results already known for $1\le p\le2$. In addition, we
observe that the hypercontractive inequalities, proved by Carlen and Lieb for
the Fermionic case, remain valid for operator space valued functions, and hence
the Kahane inequalities are valid in this setting.

We propose a useful way to describe the channel uses correlations. Moreover, we
give a general expression for the coherences decay factors as a function of the
number of channel uses and of the stochastic process power spectrum. We also
study the impact of memory on the three qubit code, showing that correlations
among channel uses affect very little the code performance.

conditional independence (CI) implication problem relative to the class of
discrete probability measures. Semi-lattices are associated with CI statements
and a finite, sound and complete inference system relative to semi-lattice
inclusions is presented. This system is shown to be (1) sound and complete for
saturated CI statements, (2) complete for general CI statements, and (3) sound
and complete for stable CI statements. These results yield a criterion that can
be used to falsify instances of the implication problem and several heuristics
are derived that approximate this ""lattice-exclusion"" criterion in polynomial
time. Finally, we provide experimental results that relate our work to results
obtained from other existing inference algorithms.

events is shown to lead to pronounced backaction effects. Measuring the current
and the shot noise provides a direct way of gaining information on the state of
the oscillator. In addition to an analytical discussion of the linear-response
regime, we discuss and compare results of higher-order approximation schemes
and a fully numerical solution. We find that cooling of the mechanical
resonator is possible, and that there are driven and bistable oscillator states
at low couplings. Finally, we also discuss the frequency dependence of the
charge noise and the current noise of the superconducting single electron

transport through a finite carbon nanotube (CNT). Varying the Fermi energy of a
CNT and the relative strength of couplings to two ferromagnetic (FM)
electrodes, we studied the conductance as well as the magnetoresistance (MR).
Due to resonant transport through discrete energy levels in a finite CNT, the
conductance and MR are oscillating as a function of the CNT Fermi energy. The
MR is peaked at the conductance valleys and dipped close to the conductance
peaks. When couplings to two FM electrodes are asymmetric, the MR dips become
negative under a rather strong asymmetry. When couplings are more or less
symmetric, the MR dips remain positive except for a very strong coupling case.
Under strong coupling case, the line broadening is significant and transport
channels through neighboring energy levels in a CNT interfere with each other,
leading to the negative MR.

Candidate source XTE J1650-500 using the BeppoSax wide energy range (0.12-200
keV) observations performed during the 2001 X-ray outburst. The source evolves
from a low/hard state (LHS) toward a high/soft state (HSS). In all states the
emergent photon spectrum is described by the sum of Comptonization and soft
(disk) blackbody components. In the LHS, the Comptonization component dominates
in the resulting spectrum. On the other hand, during the HSS the soft (disk)
component is already dominant. In this state the Comptonization part of the
spectrum is much softer than that in the LHS (photon index is ~ 2.4 in the HSS
vs. that is ~1.7 in the LHS). In the BeppoSAX data we find a strong signature
of the index saturation with the mass accretion rate which can be considered as
an observational evidence of the converging flow (black hole) in XTE J1650-500.
We derive power spectra (PS) of the source time variability in different
spectral states as a function of energy band. When the source undergoes a
transition to softer states, the PS as a whole is shifted to higher frequencies
which can be interpreted as a contraction of the Compton cloud during hard-soft
spectral evolution. It is worthwhile to emphasize a detection of a strong
low-frequency red noise component in the HSS PS which can be considered a
signature of the presence of the strong extended disk in the HSS. Also as a
result of our data analysis, we find a very weak sign of K_alpha line
appearance in these BeppoSAX data. This finding does not confirm previous
claims by Miniutti et al. on the presence of a broad and strongly relativistic
iron emission line in this particular set of the BeppoSAX data.
