by a scale Lambda ~ 1 TeV is shown to provide a viable candidate for dark
matter. The thermal relic abundance matches cosmology, while nuclear recoil
direct detection bounds are automatically avoided in the absence of (large)
couplings to quarks. The annihilation cross section in the early Universe is
the same as the annihilation in our galactic neighborhood. This allows Dirac
fermion dark matter to naturally explain the positron ratio excess observed by
PAMELA with a minimal boost factor, given present astrophysical uncertainties.
We use the Galprop program for propagation of signal and background; we discuss
in detail the uncertainties resulting from the propagation parameters and, more
importantly, the injected spectra. Fermi/GLAST has an opportunity to see a
feature in the gamma-ray spectrum at the mass of the Dirac fermion. The excess
observed by ATIC/PPB-BETS may also be explained with Dirac dark matter that is
heavy. A supersymmetric model with a Dirac bino provides a viable UV model of
the effective theory. The dominance of the leptonic operators, and thus the
observation of an excess in positrons and not in anti-protons, is naturally
explained by the large hypercharge and low mass of sleptons as compared with
squarks. Minimizing the boost factor implies the right-handed selectron is the
lightest slepton, which is characteristic of our model. Selectrons (or
sleptons) with mass less than a few hundred GeV are an inescapable consequence
awaiting discovery at the LHC.

corollary we get a formula for the dimension of any generically smooth

  Recall that, for space curves C, Martin-Deschamps and Perrin have proved the
smoothness of the ``morphism'', H_{c} -> E = isomorphism classes of graded
artinian modules, given by sending C onto its Rao-module. For surfaces X in P^4
we have two Rao-modules M_i and an induced extension b in Ext^2(M_2,M_1) and a
result of Horrocks and Rao saying that a triple D := (M_1,M_2,b) of modules M_i
of finite length and an extension b as above determine a surface X up to
biliaison. We prove that the corresponding ``morphism'', H_{c} -> V =
isomorphism classes of graded artinian modules M_i commuting with b, is smooth,
and we get a smoothness criterion for H_{c}. Moreover we get some smoothness
results for Hilb(P), valid also for 3-folds, and we give examples of obstructed
surfaces and 3-folds. The linkage result we prove in this paper turns out to be
useful in determining the structure and dimension of H_{c}, and for proving the
main biliaison theorem above.

conditions for the cancellation of the leading linear divergences generally and
find that many well-known supergravity backgrounds are of these kinds,

Sasaki-Einstein spaces. We also point out that Wilson loop in the

find Rpl=4.04 +- 0.10 R_earth and Rstar= 0.446 +- 0.011 Rsun for the planet and
star radius, confirming and improving earlier measurements with ground-based
photometry and a Spitzer lightcurve at 8 microns, as opposed to a much higher

measure no departure from strict periodicity in the transits to the level of ~7
seconds. This strongly disfavours the proposed explanation of the orbital
eccentricity of GJ 436b in terms of the perturbation by another close-by
planet. We measure a flat transmission spectrum at the level of a few parts per

create ultracold ground state molecules. A broad-band excitation seems the
natural choice to drive the series of excitation and deexcitation steps
required to form a molecule in its vibronic ground state from two scattering
atoms. First attempts at femtosecond photoassociation were, however, hampered
by the requirement to eliminate the atomic excitation leading to trap
depletion. On the other hand, molecular levels very close to the atomic
transition are to be excited. The broad bandwidth of a femtosecond laser then
appears to be rather an obstacle. To overcome the ostensible conflict of
driving a narrow transition by a broad-band laser, we suggest a two-photon
photoassociation scheme. In the weak-field regime, a spectral phase pattern can
be employed to eliminate the atomic line. When the excitation is carried out by
more than one photon, different pathways in the field can be interfered
constructively or destructively. In the strong-field regime, a temporal phase
can be applied to control dynamic Stark shifts. The atomic transition is
suppressed by choosing a phase which keeps the levels out of resonance. We
derive analytical solutions for atomic two-photon dark states in both the
weak-field and strong-field regime. Two-photon excitation may thus pave the way
toward coherent control of photoassociation. Ultimately, the success of such a
scheme will depend on the details of the excited electronic states and
transition dipole moments. We explore the possibility of two-photon femtosecond
photoassociation for alkali and alkaline-earth metal dimers and present a
detailed study for the example of calcium.

populations of early-type galaxies by means of a cosmologically motivated
assembly history for the spheroids. We implement a detailed treatment for the
chemical evolution of H, He, O and Fe in GalICS, a semi-analytical model for
galaxy formation which successfully reproduces basic low- and high-redshift
galaxy properties. The contribution of supernovae (both type Ia and II) as well
as low- and intermediate-mass stars to chemical feedback are taken into
account. We find that this chemically improved GalICS does not produce the
observed mass- and sigma-[alpha/Fe] relations. The slope is too shallow and
scatter too large, in particular in the low and intermediate mass range. The
model shows significant improvement at the highest masses and velocity
dispersions, where the predicted [alpha/Fe] ratios are now marginally
consistent with observed values. We show that this result comes from the
implementation of AGN (plus halo) quenching of the star formation in massive
haloes. A thorough exploration of the parameter space shows that the failure of
reproducing the mass- and sigma-[alpha/Fe] relations can partly be attributed
to the way in which star formation and feedback are currently modelled. The
merger process is responsible for a part of the scatter. We suggest that the
next generation of semi-analytical model should feature feedback (either
stellar of from AGN) mechanisms linked to single galaxies and not only to the
halo, especially in the low and intermediate mass range. The integral star
formation history of a single galaxy determines its final stellar [alpha/Fe] as
it might be expected from the results of closed box chemical evolution models.

broken supersymmetry, allowing for arbitrary flavour structure of the soft SUSY
breaking (SSB) parameters. We include threshold effects by evaluating the
$\beta$-functions in a sequence of (non-supersymmetric) effective theories with
heavy particles decoupled at the scale of their mass. We present the most
general form for high scale SSB parameters that obtains if we assume that the

of the use of ${\cal PT} $ symmetry. We present a case for the acceptance of
the Pais-Uhlenbeck model in the context of Dirac's theory by providing an
Hamiltonian which is not quantum mechanically haunted. The essential point is
the manner in which a fourth-order equation is rendered into a system of
second-order equations. We show by means of the method of reduction of order
\cite {Nucci} that it is possible to construct an Hamiltonian which gives rise
to a satisfactory quantal description without having to abandon Dirac.

constraints on planet formation models. Unfortunately, the inevitable
uncertainties in the current orbital elements can lead to significant
ambiguities in the nature of the secular evolution. Integrating any single set
of orbital elements inadequately describes the full range of secular evolutions
consistent with current observations. Thus, we combine radial velocity
observations of HD 12661 with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate
ensembles of initial conditions for direct n-body integrations. We find that
any mean motion resonances are quite weak and do not significantly impact the
secular evolution, and that current observations indicate circulation or large
amplitude libration of the periapses. The eccentricity of the outer planet
undergoes large oscillations for nearly all of the allowed two-planet orbital
solutions. This type of secular evolution would arise if planet c had been
impulsively perturbed, perhaps due to strong scattering of an additional planet
that was subsequently accreted onto the star. Finally, we note that the secular
evolution implied by the current orbital configuration implies that planet c
spends ~96% of the time following an orbit more eccentric than that presently
observed. Either this system is being observed during a relatively rare state,
or additional planets are affecting the observed radial velocities and/or the
system's secular eccentricity evolution.

revealed the presence of time-variable and blueshifted Na I D features,
interpreted by Patat et al. as originating in circumstellar material within the
progenitor system. The variation seen in SN 2006X induces relatively large
changes in the total Na I D equivalent width ($\Delta\rm{EW}\approx 0.5
\unicode{x212B}$ in just over two weeks), that would be detectable at lower
resolutions. We have used a large data set comprising 2400 low-resolution
spectra of 450 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the CfA Supernova
Program to search for variable Na I D features. Out of the 31 SNe Ia (including
SN 2006X) in which we could have detected similar EW variations, only one other
(SN 1999cl) shows variable Na I D features, with an even larger change over a
similar ~10-day timescale ($\Delta\rm{EW} = 1.66 \pm 0.21 \unicode{x212B}$).
Interestingly, both SN 1999cl and SN 2006X are the two most highly-reddened
objects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability is
connected to dusty environments.
  (Erratum) The large variation in the Na I D equivalent width observed in SN
1999cl results in fact from a measurement error. Our new measurements show that
the EW variation is significantly lower, at $0.43 \pm 0.14 \unicode{x212B}$.
While the EW variation remains statistically significant (3.1$\sigma$ different
from zero), it is now below the detection threshold of 0.5 $\unicode{x212B}$
derived from the Monte Carlo simulations published in the original paper. As a
result, SN 1999cl should no longer be considered as an object displaying
variable Na I D lines in our study. The fraction of SNe Ia in our sample
displaying Na I D lines thus goes from $\sim$6% (2/31) in the original study to
$\sim$3% (1/31) in the revised analysis, SN 2006X being the only SN Ia in our

quantum key distribution scheme with an untrusted source without the need of a
squash model and by solely using this extra idea. In this sense, this detector
decoy method can be seen as a different conceptual approach to adapt a single
photon security proof to its physical, full optical implementation. We show
that in this scenario the legitimate users can now even discard the double
click events from the raw key data without compromising the security of the
scheme, and we present simulations on the performance of the BB84 and the
6-state quantum key distribution protocols.

arises as computing the partition function for particle models in which certain

simply to rank-1 weights. Surprisingly, for all $r>2$ the polynomial time cases
of the dichotomy have rather more structure. It turns out that the weights must

of star-forming galaxies. Randomly distributed, clustered SNe explosions cause
the formation of hot superbubbles that drive either galactic fountains or
supersonic winds out of the galactic disk. In a galactic fountain, the ejected
gas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and falls back onto the disk.
  From 3D non-equilibrium radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations of these
fountains, we find that they may reach altitudes smaller than 5 kpc in the halo
and hence explain the formation of the so-called intermediate-velocity-clouds
(IVCs). On the other hand, the high-velocity-clouds (HVCs) that are observed at
higher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their
production. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas
from the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are
carried out to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum
losses (of 10-15%) to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls back
to smaller radii and is not largely spread over the galactic disk, as
previously expected. This result is consistent with the metal distribution
derived from recent chemical models of the galaxy. We also find that after
about 150 Myr, the gas circulation between the halo and the disk in the
fountains reaches a steady state regime (abridged).

predicted to arise from the explosive collapse (and conversion) of sufficiently
massive neutron stars into quark stars. A Quark-Nova (QN) can occur over a
range of time scales following the supernova event. For QNe that arise days to
weeks after the supernovae, we show that dual-shock that arises as the QN
ejecta encounter the supernova ejecta can produce enough photons to reionize
hydrogen in most of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM) by z ~ 6. Such events can
explain the large optical depth tau_e ~ 0.1 as measured by WMAP, if the
clumping factor, C, of the material being ionized is smaller than 10. We
suggest a way in which a normal initial mass function (IMF) for the oldest
stars can be reconciled with a large optical depth as well as the mean
metallicity of the early IGM post reionization. We find that QN also make a
contribution to r-process element abundances for atomic numbers A > 130. We
predict that the main cosmological signatures of Quark-Novae are the gamma-ray
bursts that announce their birth. These will be clustered at redshifts in the

a frequency-selective interference channel selfishly optimize their power

that a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state information
can make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performance
compared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterative
water-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. This paper
discusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its
experienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To
characterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural
equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the
investigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash
equilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of
the generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms
to form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.
Numerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori
knowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the
required information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that
improves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other
participants in the water-filling game.

the beat-frequency model is applicable to the quasi-periodic oscillations, we
show that these sources provide an excellent opportunity to test models of the

combination of quasi-periodic oscillations and torque behaviour observed for

(SM) in pure Gamow-Teller decays, producing an observable very sensitive to new
interactions. We measure the non-SM contribution to the asymmetry to be
$A_{T}$= 0.015 $\pm$ 0.029 (stat) $\pm$ 0.019 (syst), consistent with the SM
prediction. We constrain higher-order SM corrections using the measured
momentum dependence of the asymmetry, and their remaining uncertainty dominates
the systematic error. Future progress in determining the weak magnetism term
theoretically or experimentally would reduce the final errors. We describe the
resulting constraints on fundamental 4-Fermi tensor interactions.

of 7.0 mA m^-2. The vertical current density increases with increasing vertical

following four properties are equivalent: the dynamical system generated by a

ATCA images. Four of the sources are resolved into shell-like structures
ranging between 1.1 to 2.1 pc in diameter. From these data the spectra of 13
compact radio sources in NGC 4945 were modelled; nine were found to be
consistent with free-free absorbed power laws and four with a simple power law
spectrum. The free-free opacity is highest toward the nucleus but varies
significantly throughout the nuclear region, implying that the overall
structure of the ionised medium is clumpy. Of the 13 sources, 10 have steep
intrinsic spectra associated with synchrotron emission from supernova remnants,
the remaining sources have flat intrinsic spectra which may be associated with
thermal radio emission. A non-thermal source with a jet-like morphology is
detected ~1"" from the assumed location of the AGN. A type II supernova (SN)
rate upper limit of 15.3/yr is determined for the inner 250 pc region of the
galaxy at the 95% confidence level, based on the lack of detection of new
sources in observations spanning 1.9 years and a simple model for the evolution
of supernova remnants. A type II SN rate of >0.1(v/1e4)/yr is implied from
estimates of supernova remnant source counts, sizes and expansion rates, where
v is the radial expansion velocity of the supernova remnant in km/s. A SFR of
2.4(v/1e4)<SFR(M>=5Msun)<370 Msun/yr has been estimated directly from the SN

with small secret decryption exponent d, which works if d<n^{0.25}, where n=pq
is the modulus of the cryptosystem. Namely, in that case, d is the denominator
of some convergent p_m/q_m of the continued fraction expansion of e/n, and
therefore d can be computed efficiently from the public key (n,e).
  There are several extensions of Wiener's attack that allow the RSA
cryptosystem to be broken when d is a few bits longer than n^{0.25}. They all
have the run-time complexity (at least) O(D^2), where d=Dn^{0.25}. Here we
propose a new variant of Wiener's attack, which uses results on Diophantine
approximations of the form |\alpha - p/q| < c/q^2, and ""meet-in-the-middle""
variant for testing the candidates (of the form rq_{m+1} + sq_m) for the secret
exponent. This decreases the run-time complexity of the attack to O(D log(D))
(with the space complexity O(D)).

strongly variable suggesting additional absorption in dense stellar wind and
gas outflows from the optical A7I-component. The joint modeling of X-ray
eclipse and precessional X-ray variability by a geometrical model suggests the
binary mass ratio q=m_x/m_v=0.3, allowing an explnation of peculiarities of the
optical variability of SS433, in particular, the substantial precessional
variability at the primary optical eclipse minimum. For the mass function of
the optical star f_v=0.268 M_\odot as derived from Hillwig and Gies (2008)

M_\odot, confirming the black hole nature of the relativistic object in SS433.
The independence of the observed hard X-ray spectrum on the precession phase
suggests that hard X-ray emission is formed in an extended hot corona. The
Monte-Carlo simulations of the broadband X-ray spectrum of SS433 at the maximum
disk opening precessional phases allowed us to determine physical parameters of
the corona (temperature T_{cor}=20 keV, Thomson optical depth \tau=0.2), and to

for the first time. The magnetization value is nearly as large as 3\mu B/Co
that is consistent with the high spin state Co2+ in this compound recently
established by spectroscopic methods. Consequently, its originally large
magneto-optical response is further enhanced.

on differential equation to analyze the dynamics of basic Ant System algorithm.
Traditionally, the deposition of pheromone on different parts of the tour of a
particular ant is always kept unvarying. Thus the pheromone concentration
remains uniform throughout the entire path of an ant. This article introduces
an exponentially increasing pheromone deposition approach by artificial ants to
improve the performance of basic Ant System algorithm. The idea here is to
introduce an additional attracting force to guide the ants towards destination
more easily by constructing an artificial potential field identified by
increasing pheromone concentration towards the goal. Apart from carrying out
analysis of Ant System dynamics with both traditional and the newly proposed
deposition rules, the paper presents an exhaustive set of experiments performed
to find out suitable parameter ranges for best performance of Ant System with
the proposed deposition approach. Simulations reveal that the proposed
deposition rule outperforms the traditional one by a large extent both in terms
of solution quality and algorithm convergence. Thus, the contributions of the
article can be presented as follows: i) it introduces differential equation and
explores a novel method of analyzing the dynamics of ant system algorithms, ii)
it initiates an exponentially increasing pheromone deposition approach by
artificial ants to improve the performance of algorithm in terms of solution
quality and convergence time, iii) exhaustive experimentation performed
facilitates the discovery of an algebraic relationship between the parameter
set of the algorithm and feature of the problem environment.
