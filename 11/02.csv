at a certain number of points, called null points. These points can be found
directly in a potential field extrapolation or their density can be estimated
from Fourier spectrum of the magnetogram. The spectral estimate, which assumes
that the extrapolated field is random, homogeneous and has Gaussian statistics,
is found here to be relatively accurate for quiet Sun magnetograms from SOHO's
MDI. The majority of null points occur at low altitudes, and their distribution
is dictated by high wavenumbers in the Fourier spectrum. This portion of the
spectrum is affected by Poisson noise, and as many as five-sixths of null
points identified from a direct extrapolation can be attributed to noise. The
null distribution above 1500 km is found to depend on wavelengths that are
reliably measured by MDI in either its low-resolution or high-resolution mode.
After correcting the spectrum to remove white noise and compensate for the
modulation transfer function we find that a potential field extrapolation
contains, on average, one magnetic null point, with altitude greater than 1.5
Mm, above every 322 square Mm patch of quiet Sun. Analysis of 562 quiet Sun
magnetograms spanning the two latest solar minimum shows that the null point
density is relatively constant with roughly 10% day-to-day variation. At
heights above 1.5 Mm, the null point density decreases approximately as the
inverse cube of height. The photospheric field in the quiet Sun is well
approximated as that from discrete elements with mean flux 1.0e19 Mx

find that this geometrical analysis measures the actual stability when the

prove that the Jacobi metric is not always an appropriate parametrization by
showing that it predicts chaotic behavior for a system of harmonic oscillators.

principles. Five different time reversal mirrors (TRM) are introduced and their
relations are analyzed. For the boundary behavior, it is shown that for
paraxial wave only the monopole TR scheme satisfies the exact boundary
condition while for spherical wave only one of the mixed mode TR scheme, after
multiplication by two, satisfies the exact boundary condition. The asymptotic
analysis of the near-field focusing property is presented. It is shown that to
have a subwavelength focal spot the TRM should involve dipole fields. The
monopole TR is extremely ineffective to focus below wavelength as the focal
spot size decreases logarithmically with the distance between the source and
TRM. Contrary to the matched field processing and the phase processor, both of
which resemble TR, TR in a weak- or non-scattering medium is usually biased in
the longitudinal direction, especially when TR is carried out on a {\em single}
plane with a {finite} aperture. This is true for all five TR schemes. On the
other hand, the TR focal spot has been shown repeatedly in the literature, both
theoretically and experimentally, to be centered at the source point when the
medium is multiply scattering. A reconciliation of the two seemingly
conflicting results is found in the random fluctuations in the intensity of the
Green function for a multiply scattering medium and the notion of
scattering-enlarged effective aperture.

that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the
result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese

employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function,
describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the
time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that
although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to

of holomorphy contains an embedded (non-singular) Riemann surface (and also an
immersed analytic disc) passing through this point with boundary contained in

Recently some other attempts to obtain Riemann metrics representing dynamo

investigated a more realistic dynamo map solution than the one presented by
Arnold et al by producing a shearing of the Arnold's cat map, by eigenvalue
problem of a dynamo operator. In this paper, the eigenvalue of the Riemann
twisted torus dynamo flow metric is obtained as the ratio between the poloidal
and toroidal components of the flow. This result is obtained from the Euler
equation. In the twisted torus, the eigenvalue of the Riemann metric is
${m}_{\pm}=\frac{1\pm{\sqrt{5}}}{2}$, which is quite close to the value
obtained by Arnold. In the case the viscosity Reynolds number $Re\to{\infty}$,
the torus flow is unstable as one approaches the torus axis. In Arnold's dynamo
metric the eigenvalues are ${\chi}_{\pm}=\frac{3\pm{\sqrt{5}}}{2}$ which are
very close to the above value. Eigenvalues determine the growth rates of the
velocity ratio between poloidal and toroidal components of the flow. The curved
flow in torus follow previous work by Chen et al [\textbf{Phys Fluids (2006)}].
The ${\alpha}$-effect dynamo is shown to be a second-order effect in the torus
curvature and velocity flow. Loop dynamo flows and maps are also discussed.

in answering (French) biology Multiple Choice Questions, is used to test the
semantic properties of the truncated singular space and to study the relative
influence of main parameters. A dedicated software has been designed to fine
tune the LSA semantic space for the Multiple Choice Questions task. With
optimal parameters, the performances of our simple model are quite surprisingly
equal or superior to those of 7th and 8th grades students. This indicates that
semantic spaces were quite good despite their low dimensions and the small
sizes of training data sets. Besides, we present an original entropy global
weighting of answers' terms of each question of the Multiple Choice Questions
which was necessary to achieve the model's success.

to that of Bate, Bonnell & Bromm except that the initial molecular cloud is
larger and more massive. It produces more than 1250 stars and brown dwarfs,
providing unprecedented statistical information that can be compared with
observational surveys.
  We find that hydrodynamical/sink particle simulations can reproduce many of
the observed stellar properties very well. Binarity as a function of primary
mass, the frequency of very-low-mass (VLM) binaries, general trends for the
separation and mass ratio distributions of binaries, and the relative orbital
orientations of triples systems are all in reasonable agreement with
observations. We also examine the radial variations of binarity, velocity
dispersion, and mass function in the resulting stellar cluster and the
distributions of disc truncation radii due to dynamical interactions. For VLM
binaries, we find that their frequency when using small accretion radii and
gravitational softening is similar to that expected from observational surveys
(approximately 20 percent). We also find that VLM binaries evolve from wide,
unequal-mass systems towards close equal-mass systems as they form. The two
main deficiencies of the calculations are that they over produce brown dwarfs
relative to stars and that there are too few unequal mass binaries with K and
G-dwarf primaries. [Abridged]

be interpreted in terms of geometry of the locally symmetric spaces $T_n=SO(n)

become transparent geometric remarks and can be easily proved. Indeed, a finite
family of linear forms is naturally identified to a locally geodesic ray in a
space $T_n$ and the way this family is approximated is reflected by the heights
at which the ray rises in the cuspidal end. The only difference between the two
types of approximation appearing in a Transference Theorem is that the height
is measured with respect to different rays in $W$, a Weyl chamber in $T_n$.
Thus the Transference Theorem is equivalent to a relation between the Busemann
functions of two rays in $W$. This relation is easy to establish on $W$,
because restricted to it the two Busemann functions become two linear forms.
Since $T_n$ is at finite Hausdorff distance from $W$, the same relation is
satisfied up to a bounded perturbation on the whole of $T_n$.

of the Local Group dwarf galaxy Phoenix. Aims: Use this PN to complement
abundances from red-giant stars. Methods: FORS spectroscopy was used to confirm
the PN classification. Empirical methods and photoionization modeling were used
to derive elemental abundances from the emission line fluxes and to
characterize the central star. Results: For the elements deemed most reliable
for measuring the metallicity of the interstellar medium (ISM) from which the
PN formed, [O/H] ~ -0.46 and [Ar/H] ~ -1.03. [O/H] has lower measurement errors
but greater uncertainties due to the unresolved issue of oxygen enrichment in
the PN precursor star. Conclusions: Earlier than 2 Gyr ago (the lower limit of
the derived age for the central star) the ISM had Z = 0.002--0.008, a range
slightly more metal-rich than the one provided by stars. Comparing our
PN-to-stellar values to surveys for other dwarf Local Group galaxies, Phoenix
appears as an outlier.

dynamics in nanoscale exchange biased spin-valves that take account of (i) back
action of spin-transfer torque on the pinned layer, (ii) non-linear damping and
(iii) random thermal torques. Our simulations demonstrate that all these
factors significantly impact the current-driven dynamics and lead to a better
agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. In
particular, we observe that, at a non-zero temperature and a sub-critical
current, the magnetization dynamics exhibits nonstationary behaviour in which
two independent persistent oscillatory modes are excited which compete for the
angular momentum supplied by spin-polarized current. Our results show that this
multi-mode behaviour can be induced by combined action of thermal and spin
transfer torques.
