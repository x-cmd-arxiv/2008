period of a remarkably clean exponential decay of BVRI fluxes with time, with a
time constant of 12.8 d, over about 14 days. This is clearly too long to be
associated with radiative cooling. Here we propose that this may be the
signature of deceleration of the synchrotron emitting jet component. We develop
a model analogous to the relativistic blast wave model for GRBs, including
radiative energy losses and radiation drag, to simulate the deceleration of a
relativistically moving plasmoid in the moderately dense AGN environment.
Synchrotron, SSC and external Compton emission are evaluated self-consistently.
We show that the observed optical light curve decay can be successfully
reproduced with this model. The decelerating plasmoid model predicts a delayed
X-ray flare, about 2 - 3 weeks after the onset of the quasi-exponential light
curve decay in the optical. A robust prediction of this model, which can be
tested with Fermi and simultaneous optical monitoring, is that the peak in the
gamma-ray light curve at ~ 100 MeV is expected to be delayed by a few days with
respect to the onset of the optical decay, while the VHE gamma-rays are
expected to track the optical light curve closely with a delay of at most a few
hours.

performed by the LEP electroweak working group and others, demonstrated
impressively the predictive power of electroweak unification and quantum loop
corrections. We have revisited this fit in view of (i) the development of the
new generic fitting package Gfitter, (ii) the insertion of constraints from
direct Higgs searches at LEP and the Tevatron, and (iii) a more thorough
statistical interpretation of the results. Gfitter is a modular fitting
toolkit, which features predictive theoretical models as independent plugins,
and a statistical analysis of the fit results using toy Monte Carlo techniques.
The state-of-the-art electroweak Standard Model is fully implemented, as well
as generic extensions to it. This paper introduces the Gfitter project, and
presents state-of-the-art results for the global electroweak fit in the
Standard Model, and for a model with an extended Higgs sector (2HDM). Numerical
and graphical results for fits with and without including the constraints from
the direct Higgs searches at LEP and Tevatron are given. Perspectives for
future colliders are analysed and discussed. Including the direct Higgs
searches, we find M_H=(116.4 +18.3 -1.3) GeV, and the 2sigma and 3sigma allowed
regions [114,145] GeV and [[113,168] and [180,225]] GeV, respectively. For the
strong coupling strength at fourth perturbative order we obtain
alpha_S(M_Z)=0.1193 +0.0028 -0.0027(exp) +- 0.0001(theo). Finally, for the mass
of the top quark, excluding the direct measurements, we find m_t=(178.2 +9.8
-4.2) GeV. In the 2HDM we exclude a charged-Higgs mass below 240 GeV at 95%
confidence level. This limit increases towards larger tan(beta), where e.g.,
M_H+-<780 GeV is excluded for tan(beta)=70.

derived for a weakly disordered two-dimensional electron gas. We consider
disordered potential with both long and short range correlations. Electron
scattering off such disorder is not limited to small change in momentum
direction, but occurs on an arbitrary angle, including the backscattering. The
non-linearity of the transport in the considered system is a consequence of two
co-existing effects: formation of a non-equilibrium distribution function of
electrons and modification of the scattering rate off the disorder in the
presence of dc and ac electric fields. This work describes both effects in a
unified way. The calculated dissipative component of electric current
oscillates as a function of the electric field strength and frequency of
microwave radiation in a qualitative agreement with experiments.

we have devised to optimize interaction potentials in soft matter systems that
correspond to stable ""target"" structures. We are interested in finding the
interaction potential, not necessarily pairwise additive or spherically
symmetric, that stabilizes a targeted many-body system by generally
incorporating complete configurational information. Unlike previous work, our
primary interest is in the possible many-body structures that may be generated,
some of which may include interesting but known structures, while others may
represent entirely new structural motifs. Soft matter systems, such as colloids
and polymers, offer a versatile means of realizing the optimized interactions.
It is shown that these inverse approaches hold great promise for controlling
self-assembly to a degree that surpasses the less-than-optimal path that nature
has provided. Indeed, we envision being able to ""tailor"" potentials that
produce varying degrees of disorder, thus extending the traditional idea of
self-assembly to incorporate both amorphous and crystalline structures as well
as quasicrystals. The notion of tailoring potentials that correspond to
targeted structures is motivated by the rich fundamental statistical-mechanical
issues and questions offered by this fascinating inverse problem as well as our
recent ability to identify structures that have optimal bulk properties or
desirable performance characteristics. Recent results have already led to a
deeper basic understanding of the mathematical relationship between the
collective structural behavior of many-body systems and their interactions, as
well as optimized potentials that enable self-assembly of ordered and
disordered particle configurations with novel structural and bulk properties.

assumed to come from poling of the polymer, which in this study is chosen to be

the pump and the second-harmonic waves. Therefore the potential for cascaded
quadratic second-harmonic generation is investigated in particular for soliton
compression of fs pulses. We found that excitation of temporal solitons from
cascaded quadratic nonlinearities requires an effective quadratic nonlinearity

be minimized if the design parameters of the microstructured fiber are chosen

pump wavelength. Almost all design-parameter combinations resulted in cascaded
effects in the stationary regime, where efficient and clean soliton compression
can be found. We therefore did not see any benefit from choosing a fiber design

multiplet charged under this gauge group. The hidden sector interacts with the
Standard Model particles through the Higgs portal quartic scalar interaction in
such a way that the gauge bosons behave as thermal WIMPS. This can lead easily
to the observed dark matter relic density in agreement with the other various

objects, is poorly understood and yet a critical component of the evolution of
the trans-Neptunian region. The expected physical properties of outer solar
system materials (high porosity, mixed ice-rock composition, and low material
strength) pose significant computational challenges. We present results from
catastrophic small body collisions using a new hybrid hydrocode to $N$-body
code computational technique. This method allows detailed modeling of shock
propagation and material modification as well as gravitational reaccumulation.
Here, we consider a wide range of material strengths to span the possible range
of Kuiper belt objects. We find that the shear strength of the target is
important in determining the collision outcome for 2 to 50-km radius bodies,
which are traditionally thought to be in a pure gravity regime. The
catastrophic disruption and dispersal criteria, $Q_D^*$, can vary by up to a
factor of three between strong crystalline and weak aggregate materials. The
material within the largest reaccumulated remnants experiences a wide range of
shock pressures. The dispersal and reaccumulation process results in the
material on the surfaces of the largest remnants having experienced a wider
range of shock pressures compared to material in the interior. Hence, depending
on the initial structure and composition, the surface materials on large,
reaccumulated bodies in the outer solar system may exhibit complex spectral and
albedo variations. Finally, we present revised catastrophic disruption criteria
for a range of impact velocities and material strengths for outer solar system
bodies.

positron excess may be a direct evidence of dark matter annihilation or decay.
We compare the positron and anti-proton spectra with data by assuming dark
matter annihilates or decays into different final states. The PAMELA data
actually excludes quark pairs being the main final states, disfavors gauge
boson final states. Only in the case of leptonic final states the positron and
anti-proton spectra can be explained simultaneously. We also compare the
decaying and annihilating dark matter scenarios to account for the PAMELA

perturbative quantum gravitational one-loop exact correction to the global
chiral current in the standard model, string theory, and perhaps even loop
quantum gravity -- require supplementing the Einstein-Hilbert action with a
parity-violating Chern-Simons term. Such a term leads to amplitude-birefringent
gravitational wave propagation: i.e., one (circular) polarization state
amplified with propagation while the other is attenuated. The proposed Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is capable of observing gravitational wave
sources at cosmological distances, suggesting the possibility that LISA
observations may place a strong bound on this manifestation of quantum gravity.
Here we report on a calculation of the effect that spacetime amplitude
birefringence has on the signal LISA is capable of observing from inspiraling
supermassive black hole binaries at large redshift. We find that the
birefringence manifests itself in the observations as an anomalous precession
of the binary's orbital angular momentum as it evolves toward coalescence,
whose magnitude depends on the integrated history of the Chern-Simons coupling
over the worldline of radiation wavefront. We estimate that LISA could place
bounds on Chern-Simons modified gravity that are several orders of magnitude
stronger than the present Solar System constraints, thus providing a probe of
the quantum structure of spacetime.

return models that capture greater likelihoods of extreme movements. In this
paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both
fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a Poisson trade arrival
model with variable size orders. With simplifications we are led to a hybrid
SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions, whose solution is
given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against
another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the
hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered
by Nagahara, which is a type of ""Pearson diffusion"", or equivalently a
hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on
the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally
at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type
IV form. Under less restrictive assumptions richer dynamics are possible,
including bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is
identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a
priori been expected, so that ""$25\sigma$"" events are significantly more
probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation
that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian
facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with
a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market
behaviours. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an
example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also
suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity.

effects of changes in the nuclear reaction rates on both the observable

calculations over previous work, we have incorporated a modern nuclear reaction
network into our hydrodynamic computer code. We find that the updates in the
nuclear reaction rate libraries change the amount of ejected mass, peak
luminosity, and the resulting nucleosynthesis. In addition, as a result of our
improvements, we discovered that the pep reaction was not included in our
previous studies of CN explosions. Although the energy production from this
reaction is not important in the Sun, the densities in WD envelopes can exceed
$10^4$ gm cm$^{-3}$ and the presence of this reaction increases the energy
generation during the time that the p-p chain is operating. The effect of the
increased energy generation is to reduce the evolution time to the peak of the
TNR and, thereby, the accreted mass as compared to the evolutionary sequences
done without this reaction included. As expected from our previous work, the
reduction in accreted mass has important consequences on the characteristics of
the resulting TNR and is discussed in this paper.

Subhaloes are found using a 6D friends-of-friends algorithm in all haloes
originating from high-sigma peaks. For n=-1, we find that the cumulative
subhalo mass function is independent of the parameters used in the subhalo
finding algorithm and is consistent with the subhalo mass function found in
LCDM simulations. In particular, the subhalo mass function is well fit by a
power-law with an index of alpha=-0.9, that is the mass function has roughly
equal mass in subhaloes per logarithmic interval in subhalo mass. Conversely,
for n=-2.5, the algorithm parameters affect the subhalo mass function since
subhaloes are more triaxial with less well defined boundaries. We find that the
index alpha is generally larger with alpha>=-0.75. We infer that although the
subhalo mass function appears to be independent of n so long as n>=-2, it
begins to flatten as n->-3. Thus, the common practice of using alpha=-1.0 may
greatly overestimate the number of subhaloes at the smallest scales in the CDM

multiphase atomic interstellar medium (ISM). In this first study, we omit star
formation and feedback, and focus on the processes of gravitational instability
and cloud collisions and interactions. We define clouds as regions with
n_H>=100cm^-3 and track the evolution of individual clouds as they orbit
through the galaxy from their birth to their eventual destruction via merger or
via destructive collision with another cloud. After ~140Myr a large fraction of
the gas in the disk has fragmented into clouds with masses ~10^6 Msun and a
mass spectrum similar to that of Galactic GMCs. The disk settles into a quasi
steady state in which gravitational scattering of clouds keeps the disk near
the threshold of global gravitational instability. The cloud collision time is
found to be a small fraction, ~1/5, of the orbital time, and this is an
efficient mechanism to inject turbulence into the clouds. This helps to keep
clouds only moderately gravitationally bound, with virial parameters of order
unity. Many other observed GMC properties, such as mass surface density,
angular momentum, velocity dispersion, and vertical distribution, can be
accounted for in this simple model with no stellar feedback.

We describe a simple strategy for follow-up timing observations and find that,

timing point for 14000 pulsars. Obtaining a single timing point for the
high-precision timing projects of the SKA, will take less than 14 hours, 2

due to electrons binding into bosonic Cooper pairs, which exhibit coherent
behavior across a macroscopic sample. Finding the mechanism responsible for
this binding is one of the more difficult tasks of condensed matter physics.
For conventional superconductors the solution was given by the BCS theory as
being due to exchange of phonons. For the cuprate high-Tc superconductors a
widely-accepted explanation is still missing despite intense effort. The
recently discovered Fe-based high-Tc superconductors pose now a new challenge.
We present here a quantum mechanical theory for pnictides describing the
influence of the large electronic polarizability of the heavy anions. We
demonstrate that its inclusion results in electronic polarons as the low-energy
quasi-particles and also unveils a pairing mechanism for these electronic
polarons.

biological population conditioned to non-extinction, in both cases of
competition or weak cooperation between the two species. This population is
described by a stochastic Lotka-Volterra system, obtained as limit of
renormalized interacting birth and death processes. The weak cooperation
assumption allows the system not to blow up. We study the existence and
uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution, that is convergence to
equilibrium conditioned to non extinction. To this aim we generalize in
two-dimensions spectral tools developed for one-dimensional generalized Feller
diffusion processes. The existence proof of a quasi-stationary distribution is
reduced to the one for a $d$-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion process under a
symmetry assumption. The symmetry we need is satisfied under a local balance
condition relying the ecological rates. A novelty is the outlined relation
between the uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution and the
ultracontractivity of the killed semi-group. By a comparison between the
killing rates for the populations of each type and the one of the global
population, we show that the quasi-stationary distribution can be either
supported by individuals of one (the strongest one) type or supported by
individuals of the two types. We thus highlight two different long time
behaviors depending on the parameters of the model: either the model exhibits
an intermediary time scale for which only one type (the dominant trait) is
surviving, or there is a positive probability to have coexistence of the two
species.

poor groups and the field at z=0.4-0.8 based on the ESO Distant Cluster Survey.
The incidence of k+a's at these redshifts depends strongly on environment.
K+a's reside preferentially in clusters and, unexpectedly, in a subset of the
sigma = 200-400 km/s groups, those that have a low fraction of [OII] emitters.
In these environments, 20-30% of the recently star-forming galaxies have had
their star formation activity recently truncated. In contrast, there are
proportionally fewer k+a's in the field, the poor groups and groups with a high
[OII] fraction. The incidence of k+a galaxies correlates with the cluster
velocity dispersion: more massive clusters have higher proportions of k+a's.
Spectra of dusty starburst candidates, with strong Balmer absorption and
emission lines, present a very different environmental dependence from k+a's.
They are numerous in all environments at z=0.4-0.8, but they are especially
numerous in all types of groups, favoring the hypothesis of triggering by a
merger. Our observations are consistent with previous suggestions that cluster
k+a galaxies are observed in a transition phase as massive S0 and Sa galaxies,
evolving from star-forming later types to passively evolving early-type
galaxies. The correlation between k+a fraction and cluster sigma supports the
hypothesis that k+a galaxies in clusters originate from processes related to
the intracluster medium, while several possibilities are discussed for the
origin of the k+a frequency in low-[OII] groups.(abr.)

underlying space of microstates. In this review we would like to address the
question of how the classical black hole geometry itself arises as an effective
or approximate description of a pure state, in a closed string theory, which
semiclassical observers are unable to distinguish from the ""naive"" geometry. In
cases with enough supersymmetry it has been possible to explicitly construct
these microstates in spacetime, and understand how coarse-graining of
non-singular, horizon-free objects can lead to an effective description as an
extremal black hole. We discuss how these results arise for examples in Type II
string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 and on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 that preserve 16 and 8
supercharges respectively. For such a picture of black holes as effective
geometries to extend to cases with finite horizon area the scale of quantum
effects in gravity would have to extend well beyond the vicinity of the
singularities in the effective theory. By studying examples in M-theory on
AdS_3 x S^2 x CY that preserve 4 supersymmetries we show how this can happen.

examine the finite temperature magnetothermoelectric response in the vicinity

relevant to an arbitrary QCP, either with or without Lorentz invariance, and in
arbitrary dimension. In view of the broad connections to high temperature
superconductivity, and cold atomic gases, we focus on the quantum critical
fluctuations of the relativistic Landau--Ginzburg theory. This paradigmatic
model arises in many contexts, and describes the (particle-hole symmetric)
superfluid--Mott insulator quantum phase transition in the Bose--Hubbard model.
The application of a magnetic field opens up a wide range of physical
observables, and we present a detailed overview of the charge and thermal
transport and thermodynamic response. We combine several different approaches
including the epsilon expansion and associated Quantum Boltzmann Equation
(QBE), entropy drift, and arguments based on Lorentz invariance. The results
differ markedly from the zero field case, and we include an extended discussion
of the finite thermal conductivity which emerges in the presence of a magnetic
field. We derive an integral equation that governs its response and explore the
crossover upon changing the magnetic field. This equation may be interpreted as
a projection equation in the low field limit, and clearly highlights the
important role of collision invariants (or zero modes) in the hydrodynamic
regime. Using an epsilon expansion around three-dimensions, our analytic and
numerical results interpolate between our previously published value and the
exact limit of two-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.

using a rigid-body, pair-additive potential, are used to compute static
distributions and temporal correlations of tagged molecule potential energies
as a means of characterising the liquid state dynamics. The static distribution
of tagged molecule potential energies shows a clear multimodal structure with
three distinct peaks, similar to those observed previously in water and liquid
silica. The multimodality is shown to originate from electrostatic effects, but
not from local, hydrogen-bond interactions. An interesting outcome of this
study is the remarkable similarity in the tagged potential energy power spectra
of methanol, water and silica, despite the differences in the underlying
interactions and the dimensionality of the network. All three liquids show a
distinct multiple time scale (MTS) regime with a 1/f dependence with a clear
positive correlation between the scaling exponent alpha and the diffusivity.
The low-frequency limit of the MTS regime is determined by the frequency of
crossover to white noise behaviour which occurs at approximately 0.1 cm{-1} in
the case of methanol under standard temperature and pressure conditions. The
power spectral regime above 200 cm{-1} in all three systems is dominated by
resonances due to localised vibrations, such as librations. The correlation
between $\alpha$ and the diffusivity in all three liquids appears to be related
to the strength of the coupling between the localised motions and the larger
length/time-scale network reorganizations. Thus the time scales associated with
network reorganization dynamics appear to be qualitatively similar in these
systems, despite the fact that water and silica both display diffusional
anomalies but methanol does not.

ferromagnetism (F) using the extended Stoner model, which includes in
Hamiltonian the on-site Coulomb interaction, $U$, and occupation dependent

plays the role of the on-site exchange (Hund's) field. All inter-site
interactions will have included the inter-site kinetic correlation,
$<c_{i\sigma}^{+}c_{j\sigma}>$, within the H-F approximation. We introduce the
pressure-dependence to the hopping integral. Numerical results are compared
with experimental data for ZrZn$_{2}$. The kinetic correlation creates the
superconductivity without help of negative values of Coulomb interactions. The
model can explain stimulation of triplet SC by the weak itinerant
ferromagnetism. This effect was observed experimentally in ZrZn$_{2}$.

replacing the conventional homodyne tomography. Our emphasis lies on
reconstructing the Wigner function of non-Gaussian Fock states with highly
negative values in a scheme that is based on a realistic experimental setup. In
order to establish the concept of loss-tolerance for state characterization we
show how losses can be decoupled from the impact of other experimental
imperfections, i.e. the non-unity transmittance of the displacement
beamsplitter and non-ideal mode overlap. We relate the experimentally
accessible parameters to effective ones that are needed for an optimised state
reconstruction. The feasibility of our approach is tested by Monte Carlo
simulations, which provide bounds resulting from statistical errors that are
due to limited data sets. Our results clearly show that high losses can be
accepted for a defined parameter range, and moreover, that (in contrast to
homodyne detection) mode mismatch results in a distinct signature, which can be

network of unit capacity links with either $m=2$ or $n=2$, the sum of the
sources can be communicated to the terminals if and only if every
source-terminal pair is connected in the network. We show in this paper that
for any finite set of primes, there exists a network where the sum of the
sources can be communicated to the terminals only over finite fields of
characteristic belonging to that set. As a corollary, this gives networks where
the sum can not be communicated over any finite field even though every source
is connected to every terminal.

  chapter, update of supplements added (30 pages) including the relationship

starting point. However, the origin of the field is challenged. Rather than
ascribing the origin of it to a yet undiscovered phantom particle, the origin
is ascribed directly to electromagnetic energy, in particular as magnetic
charge next to electric charge of elementary pointlike particles. To this end
two instruments are used. The first one is the transform of the Higgs field
from a functional description into a spatial description, without changing the
basic properties. The other instrument is the concept of the magnetic monopole,
as introduced by Dirac. The two instruments appear to fit well together. The
results of all of this is that electromagnetic energy on its own is the source
of all mass. It implies that the search after the Higgs particle will remain
fruitless. No other equations, apart from Maxwell's Equations and Dirac's
Equation are required to express the fundamentals of quantum waves and quantum
fields, which makes the disputed Klein Gordon Equation obsolete. The theory
reveals an algorithm to explain the ratios between the lepton masses. In that
sense the theory shows a predictive element, while grosso modo, as shown, no
derogation is done to the results and instruments of canonic theory.

Pethick-Pitaevskii-type internal density matrix and find a fragmented
condensate. On the contrary the condensate Jacobi-type internal density matrix
gives complete condensation into a single state. The internal one-particle
density matrix is, therefore, shown to be different in general for different
choices of the internal coordinate system. We propose two physically motivated
criteria for the choice of the adequate coordinate systems which give us a
unique answer for the internal one-particle density matrix. One criterion is
that in the infinite particle number limit ($N=\infty$) the internal
one-particle density matrix should have the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
as those of the corresponding ideal Bose-Einstein condensate in the laboratory
frame. The other criterion is that the coordinate of the internal one-particle
density matrix should be orthogonal to the remaining $(N - 2)$ internal
coordinates. This second criterion is shown to imply the first criterion. It is
shown that the internal Jacobi coordinate system satisfies these two criteria
while the internal coordinate system adopted by Pethick and Pitaevskii for the
construction of the internal one-particle density matrix does not. It is
demonstrated that these two criteria uniquely determine the internal
one-particle density matrix which is identical to that calculated with the
Jacobi coordinates. The relevance of this work concerning $\alpha$-particle
condensates in nuclei, as well as bosonic atoms in traps, is pointed out.

of stellar parameters from the Gaia RVS spectra, is connected to this class of
estimators. A two-steps procedure was introduced. A raw parameter estimation is
first done in order to localize the parameter environment. The parameters are
then estimated by projection on specific vectors computed for an optimal
estimation. The MATISSE method is compared to the estimation using the
objective analysis. In this framework, the kernel choice plays an important
role. The environment needed for the parameter estimation can result from it.
The determination of a first parameter set can be also avoided for this

applied to non linear parameter estimation if the number of data sets to be

presented in terms of field variables of nonequilibrium systems. Here, we
consider the density field of a colloidal suspension either in a relaxation
process or in a nonequilibrium steady state driven by an external field. Using
a path-integral representation of the temporal evolution of the density field,
we find an equality that relates the magnitude of the violation of the FRR for
scalar and vector potentials of the velocity field to the rate of energy
dissipation for the entire system. Our result demonstrates that the violation
of the FRR for field variables captures the entropic component of the
dissipated free energy.

distribution is presented. This method relies on a Taylor expansion of the
trigonometric functions. It yields the Fourier modes from a number of FFTs,
which is controlled by the order N of the expansion and by the dimension D of
the system. In three dimensions, for the practical value N=3, the number of
FFTs required is 20. We apply the method to the measurement of the power
spectrum of a periodic point distribution that is a local Poisson realization
of an underlying stationary field. We derive explicit analytic expression for
the spectrum, which allows us to quantify--and correct for--the biases induced
by discreteness and by the truncation of the Taylor expansion, and to bound the
unknown effects of aliasing of the power spectrum. We show that these aliasing
effects decrease rapidly with the order N. The only remaining significant
source of errors is reduced to the unavoidable cosmic/sample variance due to
the finite size of the sample. The analytical calculations are successfully
checked against a cosmological N-body experiment. We also consider the initial
conditions of this simulation, which correspond to a perturbed grid. This
allows us to test a case where the local Poisson assumption is incorrect. Even
in that extreme situation, the third-order Fourier-Taylor estimator behaves
well. We also show how to reach arbitrarily large dynamic range in Fourier
space (i.e., high wavenumber), while keeping statistical errors in control, by
appropriately ""folding"" the particle distribution.

be utilized to extract accurate scattering properties. This calls for a
stronger need to improve on the accuracy of interatomic potentials, and in
particular the usually rather inaccurate inner-range potentials. A boundary
condition for this inner range can be conveniently given via the accumulated
phase method. However, in this approach one should satisfy two conditions,
which are in principle conflicting, and the validity of these approximations
comes under stress when higher precision is required. We show that a better
compromise between the two is possible by allowing for an adiabatic change of
the hyperfine mixing of singlet and triplet states for interatomic distances
smaller than the separation radius. A mass scaling approach to relate
accumulated phase parameters in a combined analysis of isotopically related
atom pairs is described in detail and its accuracy is estimated, taking into
account both Born-Oppenheimer and WKB breakdown. We demonstrate how numbers of
singlet and triplet bound states follow from the mass scaling.
