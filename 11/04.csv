Jupiters may drive planetary mass loss. We construct a model of escape that
includes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and
pressure confinement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the
form of a hydrodynamic (""Parker"") wind, emitted from the planet's dayside
during lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the
confining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is
sufficient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum
rates of ~2 x 10^12 g/s during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ~2
x10^10 g/s during the star's main sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses
of ~0.06% and ~0.6% of the planet's mass, respectively. For UV fluxes F_UV <
10^4 erg/cm^2/s, the mass loss rate is approximately energy-limited and is
proportional to F_UV^0.9. For larger UV fluxes, such as those typical of T
Tauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force the mass loss rate
to increase more slowly as F_UV^0.6. Dayside winds are quenched during the T
Tauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. We
conclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such
winds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary
stage. They can, however, produce observable signatures. Candidates for
explaining why the Lyman-alpha photons of HD 209458 are absorbed at
Doppler-shifted velocities of +/- 100 km/s include charge-exchange in the shock
between the planetary and stellar winds.

both the masses and radii of stars. Moreover, they enable testing tidal
synchronization and circularization theories, as well as constraining models of
stellar structure and dynamics. With the recent availability of large-scale
multi-epoch photometric datasets we were able to study eclipsing binary stars
en masse. In this thesis, we analyzed 185,445 light curves from ten TrES
fields, and 218,699 light curves from the OGLE II bulge fields. In order to
manage such large quantities of data, we developed a pipeline with which we
systematically identified eclipsing binaries, solved for their geometric
orientations, and then found their components' absolute properties. Following
this analysis we assembled catalogs of eclipsing binaries with their models,
computed statistical distributions of their properties, and located rare cases
for further follow-up, including T-Cyg1-03378, which has unusual eclipse timing
variations. Of particular importance are low-mass eclipsing binaries, which are
rare yet critical for resolving the ongoing mass-radius discrepancy between
theoretical models and observations. To this end, we have discovered over a
dozen new low-mass eclipsing binary candidates and spectroscopically confirmed
the masses of five of them. One of these confirmed candidates, T-Lyr1-17236, is
especially interesting because of its long orbital period. We examined
T-Lyr1-17236 in detail and found that it is consistent with the magnetic
disruption hypothesis. Both the source code of our pipeline and the complete

fermionic statistics, but in supersymmetric theories that include fermionic
gauge fields, there can also be ghosts with bosonic statistics. Since these
ghosts are scalar bosons, they can have vacuum expectation values (VEVs)
without violating Lorentz invariance. In particular, for the supersymmetric
group SU(2/3), one can choose a gauge with a Higgs-like bosonic ghost potential
that is minimized when one of the ghosts develops a VEV. This VEV breaks the
SU(2) x U(1) subgroup of SU(2/3) down to U(1) and spontaneously generates
vector boson masses, but without the ""hierarchy"" problems that accompany the

of a stellar system with positive phase-space distribution function are not
fully independent. Here we study the interplay between density profile and
orbital anisotropy at large radii in physically admissible (consistent) stellar
systems. The analysis is carried out by using two-component (n-gamma,gamma_1)
spherical self-consistent galaxy models, in which one density distribution
follows a generalized gamma profile with external logarithmic slope n, and the
other a standard gamma_1 profile (with external slope 4). The necessary and
sufficient conditions for phase-space consistency are determined analytically,
also in presence of a dominant massive central black hole, and the analytical
phase-space distribution function of (n-gamma,1) models, and of n-gamma models
with a central black hole, is derived for gamma=0,1,2. It is found that the
density slope in the external regions of a stellar system can play an important
role in determining the amount of admissible anisotropy: in particular, for
fixed density slopes in the central regions, systems with a steeper external
density profile can support more radial anisotropy than externally flatter
models. This is quantified by an inequality formally identical to the ``cusp
slope-central anisotropy'' theorem (An & Evans 2006), relating at all radii

indicator in all Osipkov-Merritt systems [Abridged].

computed including all relevant plasma effects into the photon's self-energy,
which leads to a resonant yield almost independent of the HP mass. The HP can
decay into three photons. Moreover, if light enough it can be copiously

reexamined: It is shown that, despite a number of unaccounted parameters, there
are significant correlations between the factors determining the morphological
type of a galaxy and its environment. Dwarf galaxies in high density regions
have lower current SFR and lower neutral gas content than their low density
counterparts, confirming earlier results from the Local Group and other denser
environments. The effect of environment is also seen in the timescale formed
from the ratio of blue luminosity to current SFR - dwarfs in higher density

self-dual point, the F-term uplifting leads to the dilation stabilization which
can naturally yield the mirage mediation pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking
terms. Generalizing to the case with anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry, we also
find that the U(1) sector generically gives a contribution to sfermion masses
comparable to the dilaton mediated one while maintaining the mirage mediation
pattern.

validate each method and compare their performances in the case of noisy

results obtained using both methods are very close, showing their reliability.
Applications investigated in this paper are focused on the estimation of the

maximized when the system begins to dimerize, i.e. it undergoes a structural

that entanglement is maximal or shows a singularity near quantum phase
transitions and that quantum entanglement cannot be freely shared between many
objects (monogamy property). Moreover, the optimization of concurrence in

those of the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles are tau-functions of the Pfaff
lattice hierarchy. In these cases the asymptotic expansions of the free
energies given by the logarithm of the partition functions lead to the
dispersionless (i.e. continuous) limits for the Toda and Pfaff lattice
hierarchies. There is a universality between all three ensembles of random
matrices, one consequence of which is that the leading orders of the free
energy for large matrices agree. In this paper, this universality, in the case
of Gaussian ensembles, is explicitly demonstrated by computing the leading
orders of the free energies in the expansions. We also show that the free
energy as the solution of the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy gives a
solution of the dispersionless Pfaff lattice hierarchy, which implies that this
universality holds in general for the leading orders of the unitary,
orthogonal, and symplectic ensembles.

(June 23-July 18, 2008), review our current mathematical understanding of the
global behaviour of waves on black hole exterior backgrounds. Interest in this
problem stems from its relationship to the non-linear stability of the black
hole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the Einstein equations, one of the
central open problems of general relativity. After an introductory discussion
of the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem
of Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of
Schwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new
more robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement. The problem of decay of
scalar waves on Schwarzschild is then addressed, and a theorem proving
quantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched. This decay statement is
carefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the
physics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics.
Following this, our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave
equation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds (including slowly-rotating Kerr
and Kerr-Newman) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly-rotating Kerr
spacetimes is stated and proved. This last result was announced at the summer
school and appears in print here for the first time. A discussion of the
analogue of these problems for spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant
follows. Finally, a general framework is given for capturing the red-shift
effect for non-extremal black holes. This unifies and extends some of the
analysis of the previous sections. The notes end with a collection of open
problems.

  USA between 1947 and 2005",,,,,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evolution of Gini coefficient for personal incomes in the USA between
1947 and 2005 is analyzed and modeled. There are several versions of personal
income distribution (PID) provided by the US Census Bureau (US CB) for this
period with various levels of resolution. Effectively, these PIDs result in
different Gini coefficients due to the differences between discrete and
continuous representations. When all persons of 15 years of age and over are
included in the PIDs, Gini coefficient drops from 0.64 in 1947 to 0.54 in 1990.
This effect is observed due to a significant decrease in the portion of people
without income. For the PIDs not including persons without income, Gini
coefficient is varying around 0.51 between 1960 and 2005 with standard
deviation of 0.004, i.e. is in fact constant. This Gini coefficient is
practically independent on the portion of population included in the PIDs
according to any revision of income definitions. The driving force of the model
describing the evolution of individual incomes (microeconomic level) and their
aggregate value (macroeconomic level) is the change in nominal GDP per capita.
The model accurately predicts the evolution of Gini coefficient for the PIDs
for people with income. The model gives practically unchanged (normalized) PIDs
and Gini coefficient between 1947 and 2005. The empirical Gini curves converge
to the predicted one when the number of people without income decreases.
Asymptotically, the empirical curves should collapse to the theoretical one
when all the working age population obtains an appropriate definition of
income. Therefore the model Gini coefficient potentially better describes true
behavior of inequality in the USA because the definitions of income used by the
US Census Bureau apparently fail to describe true income distribution.

estimate the power received by Earth from the sun at Pin = 342 W/m2 and the
power consumed, remitted and reflected by the earth and its atmosphere at Pout
= 599 kW/m2. It seems that the earth emits more power than it receives. The
earth s ground mean temperature is estimated at 15 C. A calculation based on
the black body radiation theory gives an earth s ground mean temperature of the
order of -18 C which is much lower than 15 C. The important gap between these
calculated and estimated temperature mean values requires an explanation. Here
we show that a gray body separated from vacuum by an interface and submitted to
outside incident radiation can behave like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier.
The Earth which is a gray body separated from the space by an interface,
behaves like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. The balance of the energy
exchanged between Earth and outer space is reconsidered and the 15 C Earth s
ground temperature mean value is then derived. Our result revives the
discussion on the parameters that control the Earth climate. The solar and
terrestrial radiation reflection coefficients by the earth and its atmosphere
acquire a privileged role. The Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier can be a
starting point to improve the energy use. The materials having the adequate
reflection coefficients will be indicated for specific applications.

ontologies, given in terms of theories of classical first-order logic and rule
bases, have been proposed. They either cast rules into classical logic or limit
the interaction between rules and ontologies. Autoepistemic logic (AEL) is an
attractive formalism which allows to overcome these limitations, by serving as
a uniform host language to embed ontologies and nonmonotonic logic programs
into it. For the latter, so far only the propositional setting has been
considered. In this paper, we present three embeddings of normal and three
embeddings of disjunctive non-ground logic programs under the stable model
semantics into first-order AEL. While the embeddings all correspond with
respect to objective ground atoms, differences arise when considering
non-atomic formulas and combinations with first-order theories. We compare the
embeddings with respect to stable expansions and autoepistemic consequences,
considering the embeddings by themselves, as well as combinations with
classical theories. Our results reveal differences and correspondences of the
embeddings and provide useful guidance in the choice of a particular embedding
for knowledge combination.

there is flux density in excess of the summed stellar components and accretion
disk at longer wavelengths. Reproducing the observed spectral energy
distribution from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths can be accomplished
by including a circumbinary disk composed of cool dust, with a maximum inner
edge temperature of ~500 K. The total mass of circumbinary dust in V592 Cas

(created in a pseudo-random way), and wishes to rapidly determine a subsequence
whose product is a square (which we call a square product). In his lecture at
the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians, Pomerance observed that the
following problem encapsulates all of the key issues: Select integers a_1, a_2,
>... at random from the interval [1,x], until some (non-empty) subsequence has
product equal to a square. Find good estimate for the expected stopping time of
this process. A good solution to this problem should help one to determine the
optimal choice of parameters for one's factoring algorithm, and therefore this
is a central question.
  Pomerance (1994), using an idea of Schroeppel (1985), showed that with
probability 1-o(1) the first subsequence whose product equals a square occurs
after at least J_0^{1-o(1)} integers have been selected, but no more than J_0,
for an appropriate (explicitly determined) J_0=J_0(x). Herein we determine this
expected stopping time up to a constant factor, tightening Pomerance's interval
to $$[ (\pi/4)(e^{-\gamma} - o(1))J_0, (e^{-\gamma} + o(1)) J_0],$$ where
$\gamma = 0.577...$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. We will also confirm the
well established belief that, typically, none of the integers in the square
product have large prime factors. We believe the upper of the two bounds to be
asymptotically sharp.

double hysteresis loops in the [011] direction as the S concentration increases
similar to those observed for perpendicular magnetization reversal in lightly

simple model whereby magnetization reversal occurs by a combination of coherent
spin rotation and noncoherent spin switching, which is consistent with both FMR

cluster system. We use the extraordinary depth of this dataset to test whether
the colors and magnitudes show evidence for a mass-metallicity relation in
globular cluster populations. We find only a weak or absent relation between
the colors and magnitudes of the metal poor subpopulation of globular clusters.
The weakness or absence of a color-magnitude relation is established over a
wide range in luminosity from $M_V=-11$ to $M_V=-6$, encompassing most of the
M87 globular clusters. The constancy of the colors of the metal-poor
subpopulation seen in our 50 orbit observation is in contrast to suggestions
from single orbit ACS data that the metal-poor globular clusters in M87 and
several other galaxies show a ""blue tilt."" The formal best fit for the
mass-metallicity relation for the metal-poor subpopulation in our much deeper
data is $Z\propto M^{0.08\pm0.05}$. Our analysis of these data also shows a
possible small ""red tilt"" in the metal-rich globular cluster subpopulation.
While either of these small tilts may be real, they may also illustrate the
limit to which mass-metallicity relations can be determined, even in such
extraordinarily deep data. We specifically test for a wide range of systematic
effects and find that while small tilts cannot be confirmed or rejected, the
data place a strong upper limit to any tilt of $|0.20|\pm0.05$. This upper
limit is much smaller than some earlier claims from single orbit data, and
strongly limits self-enrichment within globular clusters. This mass-metallicity
relation for globular clusters is also shallower than the relation for
galaxies, suggesting that the formation mechanisms for these two types of
objects are different.

known. Young radio pulsars and radio-quiet neutron stars cannot be covered by
the usually-applied radio pulse timing technique. However, finding substellar
companions around these neutron stars would be of great interest -- not only
because of the companion's possible exotic formation but also due to the
potential access to neutron star physics.
  Aims: We investigate the closest young neutron stars to search for substellar
companions around them.
  Methods: Young, thus warm substellar companions are visible in the Near
Infrared while the neutron star itself is much fainter. Four young neutron
stars are moving fast enough to enable a common proper motion search for
substellar companions within few years.
  Results. For Geminga, RX J0720.4-3125, RX J1856.6-3754, and PSR J1932+1059 we
did not find any co-moving companion down to 12, 15, 11, 42 Jupiter masses for
assumed ages of 1, 1, 1, 3.1 Myrs and distances of 250, 361, 167, 361 pc,
respectively. Near Infrared limits are presented for these four as well as five
other neutron stars for which we currently have only observations at one epoch.
  Conclusions: We conclude that young isolated neutron stars rarely have brown
dwarf companions.

power-like potentials. The region of allowed exponents is identified and, after
the previous study of confining (positive exponent) potentials, we now
specialize in shorter range non-confining potentials, with a negative exponent.
These non-confining potentials are close to the Coulomb potential, and they are
also relevant as corrections to the linear confinement, and as models for the
quark potential at the deconfinement transition. The mass-gap equation is
constructed and solved, and the quarks mass, the chiral angle and the quark
energy are calculated analytically with a exponent expansion in the
neighbourhood of the Coulomb potential. It is demonstrated that chiral symmetry
breaking occurs, but only the chiral invariant false vacuum and a second
non-trivial vacuum exist. Moreover chiral symmetry breaking is led by the UV
part of the potential, with no IR enhancement of the quark mass. Thus the
breaking of chiral symmetry driven by non-confining potentials differs from the
one lead by confining potentials.

loaded into the FORT via an optical molasses as compared to loading from the
MOT alone. To determine why this was the case, we measured the rate of atoms
loaded into the FORT and the losses from the FORT during the loading process.
For both MOT and molasses loading, we examined atom load rate and losses over a
range of detunings as well as hyperfine pump powers. We found that the losses
induced during MOT loading were essentially the same as the losses induced
during molasses loading at the same MOT/molasses detuning. In contrast, load
rate of the molasses was higher than that of a MOT at a given detuning. This
caused the optical molasses to be able to load more atoms than the MOT.
Optimization of FORT loading form an optical molasses improved the number of
atoms we could trap by a factor of two over that of optimal loading from a MOT.

Matsushiro, Japan (MAT) and between 1993 and 2005 at Liapootah, Tasmania (LPT).
These stations comprise the two hemisphere network (THN) of underground muon
detectors in Japan and Australia. Yearly mean harmonic vectors at MAT and LPT
are more or less stable without any significant change in phase and amplitude
in correlation with either the solar activity- or magnetic-cycles. In this
paper, therefore, we analyze the average anisotropy over the entire observation
periods, i.e. 1985-2006 for MAT and 1993-2005 for LPT. We apply to the THN data
a best-fitting analysis based on a model anisotropy in space identical to that
adopted by Amenomori et al. (2007) for Tibet III data. The median energies of
primary cosmic rays recorded are ~0.5 TeV for THN and ~5 TeV for the Tibet III
experiment. It is shown that the intensity distribution of the best-fit
anisotropy is quite similar to that derived from Tibet III data, regardless of
the order of magnitude difference in energies of primary particles. This,
together with the THN observations, confirms that the analysis by Amenomori et
al. (2007) based on the Tibet III experiment in the northern hemisphere is not
seriously biased. The best-fit amplitudes of the anisotropy, on the other hand,
are only one third or less of those reported by the Tibet III experiment,
indicating attenuation due to solar modulation. The rigidity dependence of the
anisotropy amplitude in the sub-TeV region is consistent with the spectrum
reported by Hall et al. (1999), smoothly extending to the Tibet III result in
the multi-TeV region. The amplitude at higher energies appears almost constant
or gradually decreasing with increasing rigidity.

already been carried out by Morita et al, which uses not only the gauge theory
but also the properties of the Gaussian distribution, so that it cannot be
directly applied to the systems with other bond randomness. The present proof
essentially uses only the gauge theory, so that it does not depend on the

the results obtained from the inequalities for Ising systems with Gaussian bond

distribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbed

what is found in other recent hard X-ray surveys. The extrapolation of the 2-10

spectra typically present reflection humps with reflection fraction R~1.

several key systems by a range of experimental and computational techniques.
The structure of [Cp'Mn(CO)2(eta2-HSiHPh2)] 1 has been determined by single
crystal neutron diffraction, and the geometry at the Si atom is shown to
approximate to a trigonal bipyramid. This complex is similar to
[Cp'Mn(CO)2(eta2-HSiFPh2)] 2, whose structure and bonding characteristics have
recently been determined by charge density studies based on high-resolution
X-ray and neutron diffraction data. The geometry at the Si atom in these
sigma-bond complexes is compared with that in other systems containing
hypercoordinate silicon. The Mn-H distances for 1 and 2 in solution have been
estimated using NMR T1 relaxation measurements, giving a value of 1.56(3) AA in
each case, in excellent agreement with the distances deduced from neutron
diffraction. DFT calculations have been employed to explore the bonding in the
Mn-H-Si unit in 1 and 2 and in the related system [Cp'Mn(CO)2(eta2-HSiCl3)] 3.
These studies support the idea that the oxidative addition of a silane ligand
to a transition metal center may be described as an asymmetric process in which
the Mn-H bond is formed at an early stage, while both the establishment of the
Mn-Si bond and also the activation of the eta2-coordinated Si-H moiety are
controlled by the extent of Mn-> sigma*(X-Si-H) back-donation, which increases
with increasing electronwithdrawing character of the X substituent trans to the
metal-coordinated Si-H bond. This delocalized molecular orbital (MO) approach
is complemented and supported by combined experimental and theoretical charge
density studies including the source function S(r,Omega).

modelling of the optical variability of the star during 142 days of
uninterrupted observations performed by CoRoT with unprecedented photometric
precision. We apply spot modelling approaches previously tested in the case of
the Sun by modelling total solar irradiance variations. To model the light
curve of CoRoT-Exo-2a, we take into account both the photometric effects of
cool spots as well as those of solar-like faculae, adopting solar analogy. Two
active longitudes initially on opposite hemispheres are found on the
photosphere of CoRoT-Exo-2a with a rotation period of 4.522 $\pm$ 0.024 days.
Their separation changes by approximately 80 degrees during the time span of
the observations. From this variation, a relative amplitude of the surface
differential rotation lower than about 1 percent is estimated. Individual spots
form within the active longitudes and show an angular velocity about 1 percent
smaller than that of the longitude pattern. The total spotted area shows a
cyclic oscillation with a period of 28.9 $\pm$ 4.3 days, which is close to 10
times the synodic period of the planet as seen by the rotating active
longitudes. The implications of such results for the internal rotation of
CoRoT-Exo-2a are discussed on the basis of solar analogy. A possible magnetic
star-planet interaction is suggested by the cyclic variation of the spotted
area. Alternatively, the 28.9-d cycle may be related to Rossby-type waves
propagating in the subphotospheric layers of the star.

anatase, with a degree of porosity going from 48% to over 90%. These structures
are stable with respect to heat treatment at 400 centigrade degrees, which
results in crystalline ordering but not in morphological changes down to the

photocatalytic properties, even superior to standard Degussa P25 powder, as
demonstrated by the degradation of stearic acid as a model molecule. The
observed kinetics are correlated to the peculiar morphology of the PLD grown

reaction kinetics and creates an ideal environment for mass transport and
photon absorption, maximizing the surface area-to-volume ratio while at the
same time providing readily accessible porosity through the large inter-tree
spaces that act as distributing channels. The reported strategy provides a
versatile technique to fabricate high aspect ratio 3D titania microstuctures

the horizontal size of the dominant convective cells increases with increasing
depth. Convection is driven by buoyancy work which is largest close to the
surface, but significant over the entire domain. Close to the surface buoyancy
driving is balanced by the divergence of the kinetic energy flux, but deeper
down it is balanced by dissipation. The damping length of the turbulent kinetic
energy is 4 pressure scale heights. The mass mixing length is 1.8 scale
heights. Two thirds of the area is upflowing fluid except very close to the
surface. The internal (ionization) energy flux is the largest contributor to
the convective flux for temperatures less than 40,000 K and the thermal energy
flux is the largest contributor at higher temperatures. This data set is useful
for validating local helioseismic inversion methods. Sixteen hours of data are
available as four hour averages, with two hour cadence, at

finite rings. This question is motivated by natural secure computation tasks.
Focusing mainly on the case of two-party protocols with security against

ring operations and standard cryptographic primitives, and (2) minimize the
number of such black-box calls as well as the communication overhead.
  We present several solutions which differ in their efficiency, generality,
and underlying intractability assumptions. These include:
  1. An unconditionally secure protocol in the OT-hybrid model which makes a
black-box use of an arbitrary ring $R$, but where the number of ring operations
grows linearly with (an upper bound on) $\log|R|$.
  2. Computationally secure protocols in the OT-hybrid model which make a
black-box use of an underlying ring, and in which the number of ring operations
does not grow with the ring size. These results extend a previous approach of
Naor and Pinkas for secure polynomial evaluation (SIAM J. Comput., 35(5),
2006).
  3. A protocol for the rings $\mathbb{Z}_m=\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ which only
makes a black-box use of a homomorphic encryption scheme. When $m$ is prime,
the (amortized) number of calls to the encryption scheme for each gate of the
circuit is constant.
  All of our protocols are in fact UC-secure in the OT-hybrid model and can be
generalized to multiparty computation with an arbitrary number of malicious
parties.

temperature forcing will increase indefinitely unless combated by

suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, where vertices

over multiple scales. In many cases these groups are found to correspond to
known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in
biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, or
genetic regulatory networks), or communities in social networks. Here we
present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network
data and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain
and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of
networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering
coefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of
hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partially
known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than
competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a

understood quantitatively to be successfully included in broader astrophysical
applications. In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven
mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on
winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-
Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After reca-
pitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven wind, extensions
accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. The relevance of the
so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to
infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results with theore-
tical predictions, featuring the massloss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently,
we concentrate on two urgent problems which challenge our present understanding
of radiation driven winds: weak winds and wind- clumping. We discuss problems
of measuring mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of NIR-
spectroscopy. Wind-clumping has severe implications for the interpretation of
observational diagnostics, as derived mass-loss rates can be overestimated by
factors of 2 to 10 if clumping is ignored, and we describe ongoing attempts to
allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from
stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present- day mass-loss rates.
We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of
co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of
recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars, highlighting as
to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues
regarding an adequate description of wind clumping. (Abridged abstract)

component is responsible for fluctuations around the economic trend and is
defined as a half of the growth rate of the number of 9-year-olds. This
nonlinear relationship between the growth rate of real GDP per capita and the
number of 9-year-olds in the USA is tested for cointegration. For linearization
of the problem, a predicted population time series is calculated using the
original relationship. Both single year of age population time series, the
measured and predicted one, are shown to be integrated of order 1. The
Engel-Granger approach is applied to the difference of the measured and
predicted time series and to the residuals or corresponding linear regression.
Both tests show the existence of a cointegrating relation. The Johansen test
results in the cointegrating rank 1. Since a cointegrating relation between the
measured and predicted number of 9-year-olds does exist, the VAR, VECM, and
linear regression are used in estimation of the goodness of fit and root
mean-square errors, RMSE. The highest R2=0.95 and the best RMSE is obtained in
the VAR representation. Econometrically, the tests for cointegration show that
the deviations of real economic growth in the USA from the economic trend, as
defined by the constant annual increment of real per capita GDP, are driven by
the change in the number of 9-year-olds.

of the extended Hamilton-Lagrange formalism will be presented. In this
formalism, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a system evolution
parameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a dependent variable
$t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables
$q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$
is then replaced by the generalized action $L_{e}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{e}$
denoting the conventional and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. It is
shown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ exists that are correlated
to corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ without being homogeneous
functions in the velocities. Then the Legendre transformation of $L_{e}$ to an
extended Hamiltonian $H_{e}$ exists. With this class of extended Hamiltonians,
an extended canonical formalism is presented that is completely analogous to
the conventional Hamiltonian formalism. The physical time $t$ and the negative
value of the conventional Hamiltonian then constitute and an additional pair of
conjugate canonical variables. The extended formalism also includes a theory of
extended canonical transformations, where the time variable $t(s)$ is also
subject to transformation. In the extended formalism, the system's dynamics is
described as a motion on a hypersurface within an extended phase space of even
dimension. With the extended Lagrangian $L_{e}$, it is shown that the
generalized path integral approach yields the Klein-Gordon equation as the
corresponding quantum description. Moreover, the space-time propagator for a
free relativistic particle will be derived. These results can be regarded as
the proof of principle of the relativistic generalization of Feynman's path
integral approach to quantum physics.

Zeeman effect. Recent observations of an active-region filament showed that the
linear polarization was dominated by the transverse Zeeman effect, with very
little or no hint of scattering polarization. This is surprising, since the HeI
levels should be significantly polarized in a conventional scattering scenario.
To explain the observed level of atomic depolarization by collisional or
radiative processes, one must invoke plasma densities larger by several orders
of magnitude than currently known values for prominences. We show that such
depolarization can be explained quite naturally by the presence of an
unresolved, highly entangled magnetic field, which averages to give the ordered
field inferred from spectro-polarimetric data, over the typical temporal and
spatial scales of the observations. We present a modeling of the polarized HeI
10830 in this scenario, and discuss its implications for the magnetic
diagnostics of prominences and spicules, and for the general study of
unresolved magnetic field distributions in the solar atmosphere.

thousands of objects in large optical sky surveys. Specifically investigated
are (1) techniques to approximate the precise orbits of the satellites of

RBFNs can be used as effective predictors of spectroscopic redshift given
accurate photometry, especially in combination with other learning-based

macroscopic flow and microscopic bubble motion.

chain length or solvent quality, and the size of condensates becomes
non-monotonic function of chain length. We show that the fluctuations of the

programs, reflecting their call and return nesting structure. Finite nested
words also capture the structure of parse trees and other tree-structured data,
such as XML. We provide new temporal logics for finite and infinite nested
words, which are natural extensions of LTL, and prove that these logics are
first-order expressively-complete. One of them is based on adding a ""within""
modality, evaluating a formula on a subword, to a logic CaRet previously
studied in the context of verifying properties of recursive state machines
(RSMs). The other logic, NWTL, is based on the notion of a summary path that
uses both the linear and nesting structures. For NWTL we show that
satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete, and that model-checking can be done in time
polynomial in the size of the RSM model and exponential in the size of the NWTL
formula (and is also EXPTIME-complete). Finally, we prove that first-order
logic over nested words has the three-variable property, and we present a
temporal logic for nested words which is complete for the two-variable fragment
of first-order.

relation between different levels of organization in complex systems in terms
of Critical State Transitions. A State Transition between levels entails
changes of scale of observables and, concurrently, new formats of description
at reduced dimensionality. It is here suggested that this principle can be
applied to the hierarchic structure of the Nervous system, whereby the
relations between different levels of its functional organization can be viewed
as successions of State Transitions. Upon State Transition, the lower level
presents to the higher level an abstraction of itself, at reduced
dimensionality and at a coarser scale. The re-scaling in the State Transitions
is associated with new objects of description, displays new properties and
obeys new laws, commensurate to the new scale. To illustrate this process, some
aspects of the neural events thought to be associated with Cognition and
Consciousness are discussed. However, the intent is here also more general in
that State Transitions between all levels of organization are proposed as the
mechanisms by which successively higher levels of organization emerge from
lower levels.

decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. A first protocol named the Asymmetric DF is
presented. It is based on two phases of different lengths, defined so that
signals can be fully decoded at relays. This strategy brings full diversity but
the symbol rate is not optimal. To solve this problem a second protocol named
the Incomplete DF is defined. It is based on an incomplete decoding at the
relays reducing the length of the first phase. This last strategy brings both
full diversity and full symbol rate. The outage probability and the simulation
results show that the Incomplete DF has better performance than any existing DF
protocol and than the non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) strategy using
the same space-time codes. Moreover the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff
(DMT) of this new DF protocol is proven to be the same as the one of the NAF.

that the present technique should be able to determine the composition of a
binary mixture of p and Fe with a statistical confidence of few percent, in a
way that is independent of the assumed hadronic interaction model. Moreover,
the combination of real data with the tools developed and presented here should
give an indication of the reliability of the various hadronic interaction
models in current use in the area. We center our study in the region of the
ankle, where composition carries critical astrophysical information, and use
two main parameters: the number of muons at 600 m from the shower axis and the
depth of the shower maximum obtained from the hybrid operation of the planned
muon counters and high elevation fluorescence telescopes of the AMIGA and HEAT
Auger enhancements.
