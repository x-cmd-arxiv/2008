universal extra dimension model (sUED) to explain the recent observations of
ATIC, PPB-BETS, PAMELA and DAMA. Other than the standard model fields
propagating in the bulk of a 5-dimensional space, one fermion field and one
scalar field are introduced and both are standard model singlets. The zero mode
of the new fermion is identified as the right-handed neutrino, while its first
KK mode is the lightest KK-odd particle and the dark matter candidate. The
cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PPB-BETS determine the dark matter particle
mass and hence the fifth dimension compactification scale to be 1.0-1.6 TeV.
The zero mode of the singlet scalar field with a mass below 1 GeV provides an
attractive force between dark matter particles, which allows a Sommerfeld
enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section in the Galactic halo to
explain the PAMELA data. The DAMA annual modulation results are explained by
coupling the same scalar field to the electron via a higher-dimensional
operator. We analyze the model parameter space that can satisfy the dark matter
relic abundance and accommodate all the dark matter detection experiments. We
also consider constraints from the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background,
which can be satisfied if the dark matter particle and the first KK-mode of the
scalar field have highly degenerate masses.

breaking of flavor and parity, with the resulting ""Aoki phase"" characterized by
the non-zero expectation value $<\bar\psi \gamma_5 \tau_3 \psi>\ne0$. This
phenomenon can be understood using the chiral effective theory appropriate to
the Symanzik effective action. Within this standard analysis, the
flavor-singlet pseudoscalar expectation value vanishes: $<i \bar\psi \gamma_5
\psi>=0$. A recent reanalysis has questioned this understanding, arguing that
either the Aoki-phase is unphysical, or that there are additional phases in
which $<i \bar\psi \gamma_5 \psi>\ne0$. The reanalysis uses the properties of
probability distribution functions for observables built of fermion fields and
expansions in terms of the eigenvalues of the hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator.
Here I show that the standard understanding of the Aoki-phase is, in fact,
consistent with the approach used in the reanalysis. Furthermore, if one
assumes that the standard understanding is correct, one can use the methods of
the reanalysis to derive lattice generalizations of the continuum sum rules of
Leutwyler and Smilga.

Macready","Training a Binary Classifier with the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes how to make the problem of binary classification
amenable to quantum computing. A formulation is employed in which the binary
classifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of
weak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning
process that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of
weak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring
it into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing
(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be
represented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training
examples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively
formulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it
with heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting
classifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a
variety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact
that bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error
rates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1
loss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's
implementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results
better than those obtained with boosting approaches. Since the resulting
quadratic binary program is NP-hard, additional gains can be expected from
applying the actual quantum processor.

simulations of Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD). Two types of ensembles
are compared. One is the reaction ensemble of the states at each reaction time

ensemble prepared by solving the AMD equation of motion for a many-nucleon

is performed for the fragment charge distribution and the excitation energies.
Our calculations show that there exists an equilibrium ensemble which well
reproduces the reaction ensemble at each reaction time $t$ for the investigated
period $80\leq t\leq300$ fm/$c$. However, there are some other observables
which show discrepancies between the reaction and equilibrium ensembles. These
may be interpreted as dynamical effects in the reaction. The usual static
equilibrium at each instant is not realized since any equilibrium ensemble with
the same volume as that of the reaction system cannot reproduce the fragment

dispersion of the stochastic short rate (square of volatility) is assumed to be
stochastic as well and it follows a non-negative process with volatility
proportional to the square root of dispersion. The drift of the stochastic
process for the dispersion is assumed to be in a rather general form including,
in particular, linear function having one root (yielding the original
Fong--Vasicek model or a cubic like function having three roots (yielding a
generalized Fong--Vasicek model for description of the volatility clustering).
We consider averaged bond prices with respect to the limiting distribution of
stochastic dispersion. The averaged bond prices depend on time and current
level of the short rate like it is the case in many popular one-factor interest
rate model including in particular the Vasicek and Cox--Ingersoll-Ross model.

the late-type VDF transformed from the Monte Carlo realised circular velocity

density consistent with galaxy survey results. These evolutionary behaviours of
the VDFs are strikingly similar to those of the dark halo mass function (DMF)
from N-body simulations and the stellar mass function (SMF) predicted by recent

fluctuations produced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally
explain the presence of this field and also the measured value of the dark

fact, the presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant could be signalling
the breakdown of gauge invariance on cosmological scales. The theory is
compatible with all the local gravity tests, and is free from classical or
quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only the true nature of dark
energy can be established without resorting to new physics, but also the value
of the cosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of
standard inflationary cosmology. This mechanism could be discriminated from a
true cosmological constant by upcoming observations of CMB anisotropies and
large scale structure.

in spherical symmetry is treated. The metric ansatz is chosen spherically
symmetric, conformally static with a multiplicative separation of variables.
The first fluid is described mathematically via a massless scalar field. The
coordinate system is chosen comoving with the second fluid which the separation
of variables requires to be stiff too. The fluids are interacting only
gravitationally and their energy momentum tensors are separately conserved. The
Einstein equations are reduced to a single nonlinear ODE of second order which
is shown to lead to an Abel ODE. A few particular exact solutions were found
using a polynomial ansatz. The two non-comoving gravitational sources in the
solutions can be interpreted either as scalar fields or stiff fluids. A
complete analysis is performed on the range of parameters for which the stiff
fluid interpretation is physically acceptable. General formulas are derived for
the conformal vectors of the solutions. By making the second fluid vanish, a
few single scalar field solutions are generated some of which appear to be new.
All solutions considered in this paper have a time-like singularity at the
origin (except the trivial FRW one) and are not asymptotically flat (except the
static one with k=0).

applying the GreenLab model of plant growth to sugar beet and to study the

husbandry practices in 2006. The study of sugar beet development, mostly
phytomer appearance, organ expansion and leaf senescence, allowed us to define
a morphogenetic model of sugar beet growth based on GreenLab. It simulates
organogenesis, biomass production and biomass partitioning. The functional
parameters controlling source-sink relationships during plant growth were
estimated from organ and compartment dry masses, measured at seven different
times, for samples of plants. The fitting results are good, which shows that
the introduced framework is adapted to analyse source-sink dynamics and
shoot-root allocation throughout the season. However, this approach still needs
to be fully validated, particularly among seasons.

equations, is employed in the case of small-amplitude solutions of the ion
acoustic wave equations of Plasma Physics. Instead of the traditional
derivation of a perturbed KdV equation, the ion velocity is written as a sum of
two components: elastic and inelastic. In the single-soliton case, the elastic
component is the full solution. In the multiple-soliton case, it is
complemented by the inelastic component. The original system is transformed
into two evolution equations: An asymptotically integrable Normal Form for
ordinary KdV solitons, and an equation for the inelastic component. The
zero-order term of the elastic component is a single- or
multiple-soliton-solution of the Normal Form. The inelastic component
asymptotes into a linear combination of single-soliton solutions of the Normal
Form, with amplitudes determined by soliton interactions, plus a second-order
decaying dispersive wave. Satisfaction of a conservation law by the inelastic
component and of mass conservation by the disturbance to the ion density is
determined solely by the initial data and/or boundary conditions imposed on the
inelastic component. The electrostatic potential is a first-order quantity. It
is affected by the inelastic component only in second-order. The charge density
displays a triple-layer structure. The analysis is carried out through third

significant changes in the band structure and/or carrier mobilities occur, and
phonon-phonon scattering is reduced upon transformation to the low temperature

variations in properties as the identity of Ln is changed are observed and
discussed. As Ln progresses across the rare-earth series from La to Nd, an
increase in the hole contributions to Seebeck coefficient, and increases in

observational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last EGRET
observations, more than 8 years ago. Our study was carried out using
simultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,
in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. Then a
time-resolved SED was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emission
mechanisms. The source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week of
our campaign. We found indication of a possible anti-correlation between the
emission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard X-rays, supported by the complete
set of instruments. Instead, optical data do not show short term variability.
Only in two EGRET observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3C 273 showed
intra-observation variability in gamma-rays. The SED with almost simultaneous
data, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big blue
bump, and the inverse-Compton. The soft X-ray emission is consistent with
combined SSC and EC mechanisms, while hard X and gamma-ray emissions are
compatible with EC from thermal photons of the disk. The time evolution of the
SED is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of the
electrons population, leading to a shift in the IC peak towards higher
energies.

with respect to the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chains and a
quadratic reduction with respect to the parameter characterizing the desired
accuracy of the estimate output by the FPRAS. Both reductions are intimately
related and cannot be achieved separately.
  First, we use Grover's fixed point search, quantum walks and phase estimation
to efficiently prepare approximate coherent encodings of stationary
distributions of the Markov chains. The speed-up we obtain in this way is due
to the quadratic relation between the spectral and phase gaps of classical and
quantum walks. Second, we generalize the method of quantum counting, showing
how to estimate expected values of quantum observables. Using this method
instead of classical sampling, we obtain the speed-up with respect to accuracy.

in the background of a linear dilaton. Remarkably, they were able to construct
light-like tachyon solutions which interpolate smoothly between the
perturbative and nonperturbative vacua, without undergoing the wild
oscillations that plague time-like solutions. In their analysis, however, the
full structure of the initial value problem for the nonlocal dynamical
equations was not considered. In this paper, therefore, we reexamine the
nonlinear dynamics of light-like tachyon condensation using a combination of
numerical and analytical techniques. We find that for the p-adic string the
monotonic behaviour obtained previously relied on a special choice of initial
conditions near the unstable maximum. For generic initial conditions the wild
oscillations come back to haunt us. Interestingly, we find an ""island of
stability"" in initial condition space that leads to sensible evolution at late
times. For the string field theory case, on the other hand, we find that the
evolution is completely stable for generic choices of initial data. This
provides an explicit example of a string theoretic system that admits
infinitely many initial data but is nevertheless nonperturbatively stable.
Qualitatively similar dynamics are obtained in nonlocal cosmologies where the
Hubble damping plays a role very analogous to the dilaton gradient.

interactions on graphene's honeycomb lattice at half filling is presented. The
exact symmetry of the Lagrangian with local quartic terms for the Dirac field
dictated by the lattice is D_2 x U_c(1) x (time reversal), where D_2 is the
dihedral group, and U_c(1) is a subgroup of the SU_c(2) ""chiral"" group of the
non-interacting Lagrangian, that represents translations in Dirac language. The
Lagrangian describing spinless particles respecting this symmetry is
parameterized by six independent coupling constants. We show how first imposing
the rotational, then Lorentz, and finally chiral symmetry to the quartic terms,
in conjunction with the Fierz transformations, eventually reduces the set of
couplings to just two, in the ""maximally symmetric"" local interacting theory.
We identify the two critical points in such a Lorentz and chirally symmetric
theory as describing metal-insulator transitions into the states with either
time-reversal or chiral symmetry being broken. In the site-localized limit of
the interacting Hamiltonian the low-energy theory describes the continuous
transitions into the insulator with either a finite Haldane's (circulating
currents) or Semenoff's (staggered density) masses, both in the universality
class of the Gross-Neveu model. The picture of the metal-insulator transition
on a honeycomb lattice emerges at which the residue of the quasiparticle pole
at the metallic and the mass-gap in the insulating phase both vanish
continuously as the critical point is approached. We argue that the Fermi
velocity is non-critical as a consequence of the dynamical exponent being fixed
to unity by the emergent Lorentz invariance. Effects of long-range interaction
and the critical behavior of specific heat and conductivity are discussed.

studied and constitute an important stellar population diagnostic for galaxies
in the local universe and up to moderate redshifts. Proceeding towards higher
look-back times, galaxies are younger and the ultraviolet becomes the relevant
spectral region where the dominant stellar populations shine. A comprehensive
study of ultraviolet absorption lines of stellar population models is however
still lacking. We study absorption line indices in the far and mid-ultraviolet
in order to determine age and metallicity indicators for UV-bright stellar
populations in the local universe as well as at high redshift. We explore
empirical and theoretical spectral libraries and use evolutionary population
synthesis to compute synthetic line indices of stellar population models. From
the empirical side, we exploit the IUE-low resolution library of stellar
spectra and system of absorption lines. From the theoretical side we use a
high-resolution library of Kurucz synthetic spectra. In order to select indices
that can be used as age and/or metallicity indicators for distant galaxies and
globular clusters, we compare the models to data of template globular clusters
from the Magellanic Clouds. We provide synthetic line indices in the wavelength
range 1200 Angstrom to 3000 Angstrom for stellar populations of various ages
and metallicities. This adds several new indices to the well-studied CIV and
SiIV absorptions. Based on the comparison with globular cluster data, we select
a set of 11 indices blueward of the 2000 Angstrom rest-frame that allows to
recover well the ages and the metallicities of the clusters. These indices are
ideal to study young galaxies at high redshift. We also provide the synthetic
high-resolution stellar population SEDs.

that a dimension factor can be dropped. Moreover, better accuracy is achieved

rapidly delocalized over several (3-4) bases on an ultrafast time-scale.
However, this delocalized state is unstable with respect to the motions of the
protons involved in hydrogen-bonding between Watson/Crick pairs and rapidly
re-localizes to a charge-transfer state on a longer time-scale ranging from 10

a spherically symmmetric and steady accretion flow through a standing shock

phase, we imposed uniform rotation on the flow advecting from the outer
boundary of the iron core, whose specific angular momentum was assumed to agree

Fourier decompositions in time, we performed mode analysis of the nonspherical

spiral modes and hardly affected sloshing modes, except for steady l=2, m=0
modes. In contrast, rotation imposed on the non-axisymmetric flow increased the
amplitude of spiral modes so that some spiral flows accreting on the PNS were
more clearly formed inside the shock wave than without rotation. The amplitudes
of spiral modes increased significantly with rotation in the progressive
direction.

It uses the Random

The folding times are computed using Monte Carlo simulations in the region of
the phase diagram where the chain occurs in the native structure. These folding
times are roughly equals for the temperatures of cold and warm denaturation for
a large range of solvent quality. Between these temperatures, the folding times
reach maxima and thus, at low temperatures, the kinetics of the chain always
speeds up as the temperature is decreased. The study of the conformational
space as function of the temperature permits to elucidate this phenomenon. At
low temperature, it shows that the activation barriers of the system decrease
faster than the temperature as the temperature is decreased. At high
temperature, the rate of the barriers over the temperature decreases as the
temperature is increased because the height of the barrier is almost constant.

observational point of view, an ideal candidate for the detection of an
Earth-like planet in or near its habitable zone (0.5-0.9AU). We study here if
such habitable planets can form, by numerically investigating the
planet-formation stage which is probably the most sensitive to binarity
effects: the mutual accretion of km-sized planetesimals. Using a
state-of-the-art algorithm for computing the impact velocities within a test
planetesimal population, we find that planetesimal growth is only possible,
although marginally, in the innermost part of the HZ around 0.5AU. Beyond this
point, the combination of secular perturbations by the binary companion and gas
drag drive the mutual velocities beyond the erosion limit. Impact velocities
might later decrease during the gas removal phase, but this probably happens
too late for preventing most km-sized objects to be removed by inward drift,
thus preventing accretion from starting anew. A more promising hypothesis is
that the binary formed in a crowded cluster, where it might have been wider in
its initial stages, when planetary formation was ongoing. We explore this
scenario and find that a starting separation roughly 15 AU wider, or an
eccentricity 2.5 times lower than the present ones are required to have an
accretion-friendly environment in the whole HZ.

lower than the historical average. The X-ray spectrum hardens when the source
flux becomes lower, confirming the trend of spectral variability known for many
Seyfert 1 galaxies. The broad-band averaged spectrum and spectra in high and
low flux intervals are analyzed. The spectra are first fitted with a model
consisting of a power-law component, a reflection continuum originating in cold
matter, a blackbody component, two zones of ionized absorber, and several
Gaussian emission lines. The amount of reflection is rather large (R ~ 7, where
R=1 corresponds to reflection by an infinite slab), while the equivalent width
of the Fe-K line at 6.4 keV is modest (140 eV) for the averaged spectrum. We
then model the overall spectra by introducing partial covering for the
power-law component and reflection continuum independently. The column density
for the former is 1x10^23 cm^-2, while it is fixed at 1x10^24 cm-2 for the

application of MOND to early-type galaxies, we investigate the MOND theory by
comparing its predictions, for models of constant mass-to-light ratio, with
observational data of the early-type galaxy NGC 4649.
  Aims: We study whether measurements for NGC 3379 and NGC 1399 are typical of
early-type systems and we test the assumption of a Newtonian constant M/L ratio
underlying most of the published models.
  Methods: We employ the globular clusters of NGC 4649 as a mass tracer. The
Jeans equation is calculated for both MOND and constant mass-to-light ratio
assumptions. Spherical symmetry is assumed and the calculations are performed
for both isotropic and anisotropic cases.
  Results: We found that both Jeans models with the assumption of a constant
mass-to-light ratio and different MOND models provide good agreement with the
observed values of the velocity dispersion. The most accurate fits of the
velocity dispersion were obtained for the mass-to-light ratio in the B-band,
which was equal to 7, implying that there is no need for significant amounts of
dark matter in the outer parts (beyond 3 effective radii) of this galaxy. We
also found that tangential anisotropies are most likely present in NGC 4649.

lifetimes of other supersymmetric particles. These small mass differences are
possible in the MSSM and, for instance, they correspond to the coannihilation
region of the CMSSM for $M_{1/2} \gsim 700$ GeV. In a general gravity-mediated

important for future semiconductor spintronic devices. In high-mobility
two-dimensional electron systems (2DES), the spin lifetime strongly depends on
the initial degree of spin polarization due to the electron-electron
interaction. The Hartree-Fock (HF) term of the Coulomb interaction acts like an
effective out-of-plane magnetic field and thus reduces the spin-flip rate. By
time-resolved Faraday rotation (TRFR) techniques, we demonstrate that the spin
lifetime is increased by an order of magnitude as the initial spin polarization
degree is raised from the low-polarization limit to several percent. We perform
control experiments to decouple the excitation density in the sample from the
spin polarization degree and investigate the interplay of the internal HF field
and an external perpendicular magnetic field. The lifetime of spins oriented in
the plane of a [001]-grown 2DES is strongly anisotropic if the Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit fields are of the same order of magnitude. This
anisotropy, which stems from the interference of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus
spin-orbit fields, is highly density-dependent: as the electron density is
increased, the kubic Dresselhaus term becomes dominant and reduces the
anisotropy.

attention in theoretical physics. In particular, it has been predicted on the
basis of the Harris criterion that disorder is relevant (annealed and quenched
model have different critical points and critical exponents) if the return
probability exponent alpha, a positive number that characterizes the model, is
larger than 1/2. Weak disorder has been predicted to be irrelevant (i.e.
coinciding critical points and exponents) if alpha < 1/2. Recent mathematical
work has put these predictions on firm grounds. In renormalization group terms,
the case alpha = 1/2 is a 'marginal case' and there is no agreement in the
literature as to whether one should expect disorder relevance or irrelevance at
marginality. The question is particularly intriguing also because the case
alpha = 1/2 includes the classical models of two-dimensional wetting of a rough
substrate, of pinning of directed polymers on a defect line in dimension (3+1)
or (1+1) and of pinning of an heteropolymer by a point potential in
three-dimensional space. Here we prove disorder relevance both for the general
alpha = 1/2 pinning model and for the hierarchical version of the model
proposed by B. Derrida, V. Hakim and J. Vannimenus (JSP, 1992), in the sense
that we prove a shift of the quenched critical point with respect to the
annealed one. In both cases we work with Gaussian disorder and we show that the
shift is at least of order exp(-1/\beta^4) for beta small, if beta is the
standard deviation of the disorder.

improving the throughput scaling in networks of $n$ randomly located wireless
nodes. The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the
number of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary
rates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for
both dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first
introduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing
protocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an
infrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their
achievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against
two conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and
hierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput
scaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In
contrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network
conditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.
The gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.
First, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in
the MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.
Second, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the
received signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better
throughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the
corresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under
extended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is
order-optimal in all operating regimes.

from a ~12 kpc enhancement containing a few times 10^7 Msun of iron in the
centre, to a region at 400 kpc radius with an excess of a few times 10^9 Msun.
Subtracting an average surface brightness profile from the X-ray image yields
two surface brightness depressions to the north and south of the cluster. Their
morphology is similar to the cavities observed in cluster cores, but they have
radii of 240 kpc and 160 kpc and have a total enthalpy of 2x10^62 erg. If they
are fossil radio bubbles, their buoyancy timescales imply a total mechanical
heating power of 5x10^46 erg/s, the largest such bubble heating power known.
More likely, they result from the accumulation of many past bubbles.
Energetically this is more feasible, as the enthalpy of these regions could
combat X-ray cooling in this cluster to 500 kpc radius for around 2 Gyr. The
core of the cluster also contains five to seven ~4 kpc radius surface
brightness depressions that are not associated with the observed radio
emission. If they are bubbles generated by the nucleus, they are too small to
balance cooling in the core by an order of magnitude. However if the radio axis
is close to the line of sight, projection effects may mask more normal bubbles.
Using RGS spectra we detect a FeXVII line. Spectral fitting reveals
temperatures down to ~0.7 keV; the cluster therefore shows a range in X-ray
temperature of at least a factor of 15. The quantity of low temperature gas is
consistent with a mass deposition rate of 65 Msun/yr.

Rickman et al. 1987), which is based on the gas production curve and on the
change in the orbital period due to the non-gravitational force. The gas
production curve is inferred from the visual lightcurve. We found that the
computed masses cover more than three orders of magnitude: ~(0.3 - 400)*10^12
kg. The computed densities are in all cases very low (<= 0.8 g cm^-3), with an
average value of 0.4 g cm^-3, in agreement with previous results and models of
the cometary nucleus depicting it as a very porous object. The computed comet
densities turn out to be the lowest among the different populations of solar
system minor bodies, in particular as compared to those of near-Earth asteroids
(NEAs). We conclude that the model applied in this work, in spite of its
simplicity (as compared to more sophisticated thermophysical models applied to
very few comets), is useful for a statistical approach to the mean density of
the cometary nuclei. However, we cannot assess from this simple model if there
is a real dispersion among the bulk densities of comets that could tell us
about differences in physical structure (porosity) and/or chemical composition.

Auger hybrid detector combines fluorescence observations of the longitudinal
profiles of extended air showers, initiated by these extremely energetic
particles, with measures of the shower secondaries at the ground level by its
large array of Cherenkov water tanks. The complementariness of the two
techniques provides important cross-checks at the energies unreachable with
accelerator experiments. The Pierre Auger experiment has observed a strong
steepening of the cosmic ray flux above 40 EeV. A significant anisotropy in the
arrival directions of cosmic rays has been established for events above $\simeq
60$ EeV. These events correlate over angular scales of less than 6$^\circ$ with
the directions towards nearby ($D < 100$ Mpc) active galactic nuclei. Both
observations are consistent with the standard scenarios of the UHECR production
in the extragalactic astrophysical acceleration sites. The derived stringent
upper limits on the photon and neutrino contents in the UHECR are additional
important arguments in support of these scenarios. The measurements of the
variation of the depth of shower maximum with energy, interpreted with the
current hadronic interaction models, favour the mixed cosmic ray composition at
energies above 0.4 EeV. We describe the plans and prospects for the future,

properties in the design of high-level radioactive waste repositories where
this material is proposed for use as a buffer. In the work described here, a
thermal probe based on the hot wire method was used to measure the thermal
conductivity of compacted bentonite specimens. The experimental results were
analyzed to observe the effects of various factors (i.e. dry density, water
content, hysteresis, degree of saturation and volumetric fraction of soil
constituents) on the thermal conductivity. A linear correlation was proposed to
predict the thermal conductivity of compacted bentonite based on experimentally
observed relationship between the volumetric fraction of air and the thermal
conductivity. The relevance of this correlation was finally analyzed together
with others existing methods using experimental data on several compacted
bentonites.

large number of planetary observations including also two years (2004-2006) of
normal points from the Cassini spacecraft, phenomenologically estimated a
statistically significant non-zero correction to the usual
Newtonian/Einsteinian secular precession of the longitude of the perihelion of
Saturn, i.e. \Delta\dot\varpi_Sat = -0.006 +/- 0.002 arcsec/cy; the formal,
statistical error is 0.0007 arcsec/cy. It can be explained neither by any of
the standard classical and general relativistic dynamical effects
mismodelled/unmodelled in the force models of the EPM2008 ephemerides nor by
several exotic modifications of gravity recently put forth to accommodate
certain cosmological/astrophysical observations without resorting to dark
energy/dark matter. Both independent analyses by other teams of astronomers and
further processing of larger data sets from Cassini will be helpful in
clarifying the nature and the true existence of the anomalous precession of the
perihelion of Saturn.

by thresholding a field of test statistics at a level $u$ chosen to control the
tail probability or $p$-value of its maximum. This $p$-value is approximated by
the expected Euler characteristic (EC) of the excursion set of the test
statistic field above $u$, denoted $\mathbb{E}\varphi(A_u)$. Under isotropy,
one can use the expansion
$\mathbb{E}\varphi(A_u)=\sum_k\mathcal{V}_k\rho_k(u)$, where $\mathcal{V}_k$ is
an intrinsic volume of the parameter space and $\rho_k$ is an EC density of the
field. EC densities are available for a number of processes, mainly those
constructed from (multivariate) Gaussian fields via smooth functions. Using
saddlepoint methods, we derive an expansion for $\rho_k(u)$ for fields which
are only approximately Gaussian, but for which higher-order cumulants are
available. We focus on linear combinations of $n$ independent non-Gaussian
fields, whence a Central Limit theorem is in force. The threshold $u$ is
allowed to grow with the sample size $n$, in which case our expression has a
smaller relative asymptotic error than the Gaussian EC density. Several
illustrative examples including an application to ""bubbles"" data accompany the
theory.

within a scaling picture that shows the buildup of Kondo screening at low
temperature. For the non-equilibrium Kondo model with a voltage bias the key
new feature are decoherence effects due to the current across the impurity. In
the present paper we show how one can develop a consistent framework for
studying the non-equilibrium Kondo model within a scaling picture of
infinitesimal unitary transformations (flow equations). Decoherence effects
appear naturally in third order of the beta-function and dominate the
Hamiltonian flow for sufficiently large voltage bias. We work out the spin
dynamics in non-equilibrium and compare it with finite temperature equilibrium
results. In particular, we report on the behavior of the static spin
susceptibility including leading logarithmic corrections and compare it with
the celebrated equilibrium result as a function of temperature.
