scales of 20-100 pc using a set of N-body/SPH simulations of binary mergers of
disk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:10. Our numerical experiments are
designed to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. The
initial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the LambdaCDM paradigm
of structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiative
cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. We find that the pairing of
SMBHs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in the
center of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. In
particular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we find
that a pair of SMBHs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies are
relatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that the
mergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical friction
timescales are shorter. Since 1:10 mergers are most common events during the
assembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift when
galaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications for
future gravitational wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna.

have been successfully applied to obtain a covariant nonperturbative
description of QED and QCD bound states. Coulomb-type potentials in these
applications lead naively in other approaches to singular relativistic
corrections at short distances that require the introduction of either
perturbative treatments or smoothing parameters. We examine the corresponding
singular structures in the effective potentials of the relativistic
Schroedinger equation obtained from the Pauli reduction of the TBDE. We find
that the relativistic Schroedinger equation lead in fact to well-behaved wave
function solutions when the full potential and couplings of the system are
taken into account. The most unusual case is the coupled triplet system with
S=1 and L={(J-1),(J+1)}. Without the inclusion of the tensor coupling, the
effective S-state potential would become attractively singular. We show how
including the tensor coupling is essential in order that the wave functions be
well-behaved at short distances. For example, the S-state wave function becomes
simply proportional to the D-state wave function and dips sharply to zero at
the origin, unlike the usual S-state wave functions. Furthermore, this behavior
is similar in both QED and QCD, independent of the asymptotic freedom behavior
of the assumed QCD vector potential. Light- and heavy-quark meson states can be
described well by using a simplified linear-plus-Coulomb-type QCD potential
apportioned appropriately between world scalar and vector potentials. We use
this potential to exhibit explicitly the origin of the large pi-rho splitting
and effective chiral symmetry breaking. The TBDE formalism developed here may
be used to study quarkonia in quark-gluon plasma environments.

orbits (UPOs) by stabilising transformations, where the strategy is to
transform the system of interest in such a way that the orbits become stable.
The main difficulty of using this method is that the number of transformations,
which were used in the past, becomes overwhelming as we move to higher
dimensions (Davidchack and Lai 1999; Schmelcher et al. 1997, 1998). We have
recently proposed a set of stabilising transformations which is constructed
from a small set of already found UPOs (Crofts and Davidchack 2006). The main
benefit of using the proposed set is that its cardinality depends on the
dimension of the unstable manifold at the UPO rather than the dimension of the
system. In a typical situation the dimension of the unstable manifold is much
smaller than the dimension of the system so the number of transformations is
much smaller. Here we extend this approach to high-dimensional systems of ODEs
and apply it to the model example of a chaotic spatially extended system -- the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. A comparison is made between the performance of
this new method against the competing methods of Newton-Armijo (NA) and
Levernberg-Marquardt (LM). In the latter case, we take advantage of the fact
that the LM algorithm is able to solve under-determined systems of equations,
thus eliminating the need for any additional constraints.

frequencies distributed in 10 modes, as well as numerous combination

the identified modes are consistent throughout the years, the multiplet
structure is complex and cannot be interpreted simply as l=1 modes in the limit
of slow rotation. The high k multiplets exhibit significant variability in
structure, amplitude and frequency. Any identification of the m components for
the high k multiplets is highly suspect. The k=9 and 8 modes typically do show
triplet structure more consistent with theoretical expectations. The
frequencies and amplitudes exhibit some variability, but much less than the

translate second quantization of a system of bosons/fermions on a symmetric
spacetime in a non-commutative language. The procedure deforms in a coordinated
way the spacetime algebra and its symmetries, the wave-mechanical description
of a system of n bosons/fermions, the algebra of creation and annihilation
operators and also the commutation relations of the latter with functions of
spacetime; our key requirement is the mode-decomposition independence of the
quantum field. In a conservative view, the use of noncommutative coordinates
can be seen just as a way to better express non-local interactions of a special
kind. In a non-conservative one, we obtain a covariant framework for QFT on the
corresponding noncommutative spacetime consistent with quantum mechanical
axioms and Bose-Fermi statistics. One distinguishing feature is that the field
commutation relations remain of the type ""field (anti)commutator=a
distribution"". We illustrate the results by choosing as examples interacting
non-relativistic and free relativistic QFT on Moyal space(time)s.

effects of macromolecules on the folding of proteins. Using the Self-Organized
Polymer (SOP) model, which is a coarse-grained representation of polypeptide
chains, we probe the mechanical stability of Ubiquitin (Ub) monomers and
trimers ((Ub)$_3$) in the presence of monodisperse spherical crowding agents.
Crowding increases the volume fraction ($\Phi_c$)-dependent average force
($<f_u(\Phi_c)>$), relative to the value at $\Phi_c = 0$, needed to unfold Ub
and the polyprotein. For a given $\Phi_c$, the values of $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$
increase as the diameter ($\sigma_c$) of the crowding particles decreases. The
average unfolding force $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$ depends on the ratio $\frac{D}{R_g}$,
where $D \approx \sigma_c (\frac{\pi}{6 \Phi_c})^{{1/3}}$ with $R_g$ being the
radius of gyration of Ub (or (Ub)$_3$) in the unfolded state. Examination of
the unfolding pathways shows that, relative to $\Phi_c = 0$, crowding promotes
reassociation of ruptured secondary structural elements. Both the nature of the
unfolding pathways and $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$ for (Ub)$_3$ are altered in the presence
of crowding particles with the effect being most dramatic for the subunit that
unfolds last. We predict, based on SOP simulations and theoretical arguments,
that $<f_u(\Phi_c) > \sim \Phi_c^{\frac{1}{3\nu}}$, where $\nu$ is the Flory
exponent that describes the unfolded (random coil) state of the protein.

flares and flux-rope destabilizations. Numerical modeling of specific solar
regions is hampered by uncertain coronal-field reconstructions and by poorly
understood magnetic re- connection; these limitations result in uncertain
estimates of field topology, energy, and helicity. The primary advances in
understanding field destabilizations therefore come from the combination of
generic numerical experiments with interpretation of sets of observations.
These suggest a critical role for the emergence of twisted flux ropes into
pre-existing strong field for many, if not all, of the active regions that pro-
duce M- or X-class flares. The flux and internal twist of the emerging ropes
appear to play as important a role in determining whether an eruption will
develop predom- inantly as flare, confined eruption, or CME, as do the
properties of the embedding field. Based on reviewed literature, I outline a
scenario for major flares and erup- tions that combines flux-rope emergence,
mass draining, near-surface reconnection, and the interaction with the
surrounding field. Whether deterministic forecasting is in principle possible
remains to be seen: to date no reliable such forecasts can be made.
Large-sample studies based on long-duration, comprehensive observations of
active regions from their emergence through their flaring phase are needed to
help us better understand these complex phenomena.

of J/psi or high-pT particles, in nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at RHIC.
Surprisingly, the magnitude of the suppression is quite similar to that at SPS.
In order to establish whether these features arise due to the presence of a
thermalized system of quarks and gluons formed in the course of the collision,
one should investigate the impact of suppression mechanisms which do not
explicitly involve such a state. We calculate shadowing for gluons in the
Glauber-Gribov theory and propose a model invoking a rapidity-dependent
absorptive mechanism motivated by energy-momentum conservation effects.
Furthermore, final state suppression due to interaction with co-moving matter
(hadronic or pre-hadronic) has been shown to describe data at SPS. We extend
this model by including the backward reaction channel, i.e. recombination of
open charm, which is estimated directly from pp data at RHIC. Strong
suppression of charmonium both in pA and AA collisions at LHC is predicted.
This is in stark contrast with the predictions of models assuming QGP formation
and thermalization of heavy quarks.

physically touch each other along one direction. This design stabilizes
remanent states which differ from the magnetic vortex state typical of
individual non-interacting triangles. Magnetic Force Microscopy images have
revealed that the magnetic landscape of the template can be switched to an
ordered configuration after magnetizing the sample with an in-plane field. The
ordered phase exhibits a broad flux flow regime with relatively low critical
current and a highly anisotropic response. This behavior is caused by the
spontaneous formation of two separated rows of vortices and antivortices along
each line of connected triangles. The existence of a clear flux flow regime
even for zero external field supports this interpretation. The density of
induced vortex-antivortex pairs is directly obtained using a high frequency
measurement technique which allows us to resolve the discrete motion of
vortices. Strikingly, the presence of vortex-antivortex rows gives rise to a
self organized synchronized motion of vortices which manifests itself as field
independent Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristics.

frameworks are also considered: estimation, as opposed to identification. For
estimation with finite sample size $n$, optimality is achieved for $p$ large
enough [with $p/n=o(1)$] to balance the overfitting resulting from the
structure of the model collection. For identification, model selection
consistency is settled for Lpo as long as $p/n$ is conveniently related to the
rate of convergence of the best estimator in the collection: (i) $p/n\to1$ as

on its own terms. Specifically, the theory has its own ('subquantum') theory of
measurement, and in general describes a 'nonequilibrium' state that violates
the Born rule. Furthermore, in realistic models of the classical limit, one
does not obtain localised pieces of an ontological pilot wave following
alternative macroscopic trajectories: from a de Broglie-Bohm viewpoint,
alternative trajectories are merely mathematical and not ontological. Thus,
from the perspective of pilot-wave theory itself, many worlds are an illusion.
It is further argued that, even leaving pilot-wave theory aside, the theory of
many worlds is rooted in the intrinsically unlikely assumption that quantum
measurements should be modelled on classical measurements, and is therefore
unlikely to be true.

three-dimensional 512 cube compressible MHD isothermal simulations performed
for different sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers. We introduce the bispectrum, a
new tool for statistical studies of the interstellar medium which, unlike an
ordinary power spectrum of turbulence, preserves the phase information of the
stochastic field. We show that the bispectra of the 3D stochastic density field
and of column densities, available from observations, are similar. We use the
bispectrum technique to define the role of non-linear wave-wave interactions in
the turbulent energy cascade. We also obtained the bispectrum function for
density and column densities with varying magnetic field strength. Larger
values of sonic Mach number result in increased correlations for modes with
different wavenumbers. This effect becomes more evident with increasing
magnetic field intensity. In addition to the bispectrum, we calculated the 3rd
and 4th statistical moments of density and column density, namely, skewness and
kurtosis, respectively. We found a strong dependence of skewness and kurtosis
with the sonic Mach number. In particular, as this number increases, so does
the asymmetry of the density distribution. We also studied the correlations of
2D column density with dispersion of velocities and magnetic field, as well as
the correlations of 3D density with magentic and kinetic energy and Alfven Mach
number for comparison. Our results show that column density is linearly
correlated with magnetic field for high sonic Mach number. This trend is
independent of the turbulent kinetic energy and can be used to characterize
inhomogeneities of physical properties in low density clumps in the ISM.

full-rationality game theory to allow bounded rational agents. The associated
mathematical framework can be used to solve constrained optimization problems.
This is done by translating the problem into an iterated game, where each agent
controls a different variable of the problem, so that the joint probability
distribution across the agents' moves gives an expected value of the objective
function. The dynamics of the agents is designed to minimize a Lagrangian
function of that joint distribution. Here we illustrate how the updating of the
Lagrange parameters in the Lagrangian is a form of automated annealing, which
focuses the joint distribution more and more tightly about the joint moves that
optimize the objective function. We then investigate the use of
``semicoordinate'' variable transformations. These separate the joint state of
the agents from the variables of the optimization problem, with the two
connected by an onto mapping. We present experiments illustrating the ability
of such transformations to facilitate optimization. We focus on the special

  We suggest a mechanism to explain the apparent increase in nitrogen with
depth. Specifically, if we are seeing Eris 50 degrees from pole-on (Brown and
Schaller, 2008), the pole we are seeing now at aphelion was in winter darkness
at perihelion. Near perihelion, sublimation could have built up atmospheric
pressure on the sunlit (summer) hemisphere sufficient to drive winds toward the
dark (winter) hemisphere, where the winds would condense. Because nitrogen is
more volatile and scarcer than methane, it sublimated from the sunlit
hemisphere relatively early in the season, so the early summer atmosphere was
nitrogen rich, and so was the ice deposited on the winter pole. Later in the
season, much of the nitrogen was exhausted from the summer pole, but there was
plenty of methane, which continued to sublimate. At this point, the atmosphere
was more depleted in nitrogen, as was the ice freezing out on top of the
earlier deposited nitrogen rich ice.

the initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy. However,
cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the power
spectrum varies with mass scale dramatically in the so-called concordance
Lambda CDM cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its structural evolution
should work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and different
power spectra. We use a large set of high-resolution N-body simulations of a
variety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard CDM, open CDM, and
Lambda CDM) to study the mass accretion histories (MAHs), the mass and redshift
dependence of concentrations and the concentration evolution histories of dark
matter halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the
much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. According to
two simple but tight correlations we find from the simulation results, we
develop new empirical models for both the MAHs and the concentration evolution
histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict the
mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These models are accurate
and universal: the same set of model parameters works well for different
cosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshifts
and the model predictions are highly accurate even when the histories are
traced to very high redshift. These models are also simple and easy to
implement. A web calculator and a user-friendly code to make the relevant

Lockmann et al (2008) recently suggested that Kozai oscillations induced by the
two young massive stellar discs in the Galactic centre drives the orbits of the
young stars to large eccentricity ($e\approx 1$). If some of these young
eccentric stars are in binaries, they would be disrupted near pericentre,
leaving one star in a tight orbit around the central SMBH and producing the
S-star population. I find that the {\it spherical} stellar bulge suppresses
Kozai oscillations, when its enclosed mass inside of a test body is of order
the mass in the stellar disc(s). Since the stellar bulge in the Galactic centre
is much larger than the stellar discs, Kozai oscillations {\it due to the
stellar discs} are likely suppressed. Whether Kozai oscillations are induced

components in Chandra X-ray spectra for five of a sample of seven massive,
merging galaxy clusters with powerful radio halos. The emission components can
be fitted by power-law models with mean photon indices in the range 1.5 < Gamma
< 2.0. A control sample of regular, dynamically relaxed clusters, without radio
halos but with comparable mean thermal temperatures and luminosities, shows no
compelling evidence for similar components. Detailed X-ray spectral mapping
reveals the complex thermodynamic states of the radio halo clusters. Our
deepest observations, of the Bullet Cluster 1E 0657-56, demonstrate a spatial
correlation between the strongest power-law X-ray emission, highest thermal
pressure, and brightest 1.34GHz radio halo emission in this cluster. We confirm
the presence of a shock front in the 1E 0657-56 and report the discovery of a
new, large-scale shock front in Abell 2219. We explore possible origins for the
power-law X-ray components. These include inverse Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in the clusters;
bremsstrahlung from supra-thermal electrons energized by Coulomb collisions
with an energetic, nonthermal proton population; and synchrotron emission
associated with ultra-relativistic electrons. Interestingly, we show that the
power-law signatures may also be due to complex temperature and/or metallicity
structure in clusters particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients. In
this case, an important distinguishing characteristic between the radio halo
clusters and control sample of predominantly cool-core clusters is the
relatively low central X-ray surface brightness of the former.

is by far the most popular model for the origin of galactic cosmic rays.
Despite the general consensus received by this model, an unambiguous and
conclusive proof of the supernova remnant hypothesis is still missing. In this
context, the recent developments in gamma ray astronomy provide us with
precious insights into the problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays, since
production of gamma rays is expected both during the acceleration of cosmic
rays at supernova remnant shocks and during their subsequent propagation in the
interstellar medium. In particular, the recent detection of a number of
supernova remnants at TeV energies nicely fits with the model, but it still
does not constitute a conclusive proof of it, mainly due to the difficulty of
disentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the observed gamma ray
emission. In this paper, the most relevant cosmic-ray-related results of gamma
ray astronomy are briefly summarized, and the foreseeable contribution of
future gamma ray observations to the final solution of the problem of cosmic
ray origin is discussed.

observations of Doppler broadened emission and absorption lines. The focus of
the present review is on two new techniques, the Velocity-Channel Analysis
(VCA), which makes use of the channel maps, and the Velocity Coordinate
Spectrum (VCS), which utilizes the fluctuations measured along the velocity
axis of the Position-Position Velocity (PPV) data cubes. Both techniques have
solid theoretical foundations based on analytical calculations as well as on
numerical testings. Among the two the VCS, which has been developed quite
recently, has two unique features. First of all, it is applicable to turbulent
volumes that are not spatially resolved. Second, it can be used with absorption
lines that do not provide good spatial sampling of different lags over the
image of the turbulent object. In fact, recent studies show that measurements
of absorption line along less than 10 absorption directions are sufficient for
a reliable recovering of the underlying spectrum of the turbulence. Moreover,
both weak absorption lines and absorption lines in saturated regime can be
used, which extends the applicability of the technique. Our comparison of the
VCA and the VCS with a more traditional technique of Velocity Centroids shows
that the former two techniques recover reliably the spectra of supersonic
turbulence, while the Velocity Centroids may be used only for studying subsonic
turbulence. We discuss spectra of astrophysical turbulence obtained with the
VCA and the VCS techniques.

loop corrections by some authors in the Electroweak standard model (SM)
framework. This production was also calculated, at the tree level, in some
extensions of the SM such as the vector singlet, the fermion mirror fermion and
the vector doublet models by considering the contributions of new neutral gauge
bosons and exotic fermions. The obtained results for $e^+ e^-$ and $pp$
collisions pointed out that the new physics contributions are quite important.
This motivates us to calculate the production of a more massive charged gauge
boson predicted by the ${SU (3)_C \times SU (3)_L \times U (1)_X}$ model (3-3-1
model). Thus, the aim of the present paper is to analyze the role played by of
the extra gauge boson ${Z^\prime}$ and of the exotic quarks, predicted in the
minimal version of the 3-3-1 model, by considering the inclusive production of
a pair of bileptons ($V^\pm$) in the reaction $p + p \longrightarrow V^+ + V^-
+ X$, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.
  Our results show that the correct energy behavior of the elementary cross
section follows from the balance between the contributions of the extra neutral
gauge boson with those from the exotic quarks. The extra neutral gauge boson
induces flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) at tree level, and we have
introduced the ordinary quark mixing matrices for the model when the first
family transforms differently to the other two with respect to $SU(3)_L$. We
obtain a huge number of heavy bilepton pairs produced for two different values
of the center of mass energy of the LHC.

The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is modified by the inclusion of three

terms to mix among the different generations, the sneutrino and slepton mass
terms have only intra-generation lepton number violation but not
inter-generation lepton number mixing. So doing, the muonium-antimuonium
conversion can then be used to constrain those model parameters which avoid
further constraint from the $\mu\to e\gamma$ decay bounds. For a wide range of
parameter values, the contributions to the muonium-antimuonium oscillation time
scale are at least two orders of magnitude below the sensivity of current

very small, there is a limited possibility that the contributions are large
enough for the present experimental limit to provide an inequality relating
$\tan\beta$ with the light neutrino mass scale $m_\nu$ which is generated by
see-saw mechanism. The resultant lower bound on $\tan\beta$ as a function of

existing data by re-calculating the distances and velocities for a set of
galactic constants R_0=8 kpc and V_0=200 km/s. We decompose it into a bulge
with de Vaucouleurs-law profile of half-mass scale radius 0.5 kpc and mass 1.8
x 10^{10}M_{sun}, an exponential disk of scale radius 3.5 kpc of 6.5 x
10^{10}M_{sun}, and an isothermal dark halo of terminal velocity 200 km/s. The
r^{1/4}-law fit was obtained for the first time for the Milky Way's rotation
curve. After fitting by these fundamental structures, two local minima, or the
dips, of rotation velocity are prominent at radii 3 and 9 kpc. The 3-kpc dip is
consistent with the observed bar. It is alternatively explained by a massive
ring with the density maximum at radius 4 kpc. The 9-kpc dip is clearly
exhibited as the most peculiar feature in the galactic rotation curve. We
explain it by a massive ring of amplitude as large as 0.3 to 0.4 times the disk
density with the density peak at radius 11 kpc. This great ring may be related
to the Perseus arm, while no peculiar feature of HI-gas is associated.

NFW model indicates that the Galaxy's mass within 385 kpc, half distance to
M31, is ~ 4 x 10^{11}M_{sun}. High-velocity ends of the pseudo rotation curve

dark matter of mass ~ 5 x 10^{12}M_{sun} filling the space between the Galaxy

the Local Group's dark matter at R ~ 100 kpc, beyond which the intracluster

hierarchical formation models like LCDM. Here we investigate this issue as
motivated by raw merger statistics derived for galaxy-size dark matter halos
from LCDM simulations. Our analysis shows that a majority (~70%) of galaxy
halos with M = 10^12 M_sun at z=0 should have accreted at least one object with
mass m > 10^11 M_sun ~ 3 M_disk over the last 10 Gyr. Mergers involving larger
objects should have been rare, and this pinpoints m/M = 0.1 mass-ratio mergers
as the most worrying ones for the survival of thin galactic disks. Motivated by
these results, we use use high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations
to study the response of stellar Milky-Way type disks to these common mergers
and show that thin disks do not survive the bombardment. The remnant galaxies
are roughly three times as thick and twice as kinematically hot as the observed
thin disk of the Milky Way. Finally, we evaluate the suggestion that disks may
be preserved if the mergers involve gas-rich progenitors. Using empirical
measures to assign stellar masses and gas masses to dark matter halos as a
function of redshift, we show that the vast majority of large mergers
experienced by 10^12 M_sun halos should be gas-rich (f_gas > 0.5), suggesting
that this is a potentially viable solution to the disk formation conundrum.
Moreover, gas-rich mergers should become increasingly rare in more massive
halos > 10^12.5 M_sun, and this suggest that merger gas fractions may play an
important role in establishing morphological trends with galaxy luminosity.

a very similar behavior and in particular a single layer with CuO

has a wide range of stability for all orientations. Our results are consistent

consider a prototypical reciprocal motion (i.e. identical under time-reversal
symmetry): The periodic flapping of a tethered semi-infinite plane. In the
Newtonian limit, such motion cannot be used for force generation according to
Purcell's scallop theorem. In a polymeric fluid (Oldroyd-B, and its
generalization), we show that this is not the case and calculate explicitly the
forces on the flapper for small-amplitude sinusoidal motion. Three setups are
considered: a flapper near a wall, a flapper in a wedge, and a two-dimensional
scallop-like flapper. In all cases, we show that at quadratic order in the
oscillation amplitude, the tethered flapping motion induces net forces but no
average flow. Our results demonstrate therefore that the scallop theorem is not
valid in polymeric fluids. The reciprocal component of the movement of
biological appendages such as cilia can thus generate nontrivial forces in

one or more lower--mass planets whose existence is not contradicted by
long-term orbit stability analyses, in fact it is expected according to the
""packed planetary systems"" hypothesis and an empirical Titius--Bode relation
recently proposed for 55 Cnc. Furthermore, the second largest planet is just
the second farthest and it orbits very close to the star. Its orbit, the most
circular of all, appears to be nearly but not quite commensurable with the
orbit of the third planet, casting doubt that any migration or resonant capture
of the inner planets has ever occurred and lending support to the idea of
""in--situ"" giant planet formation by the process of core accretion. All of the
above ideas will be tested in the coming years in this natural laboratory as
more observations will become available. This opportunity presents itself in
conjunction with a physical model that relates the orbits of the observed
planets to the structure of the original protoplanetary disk that harbored
their formation at the early stages of protostellar collapse. Using only the 5
observed planets of 55 Cnc, this model predicts that the surface density
profile of its protoplanetary disk varied with distance $R$ precisely as
$\Sigma (R)\propto R^{-3/2}$, as was also found for the minimum--mass solar
nebula. Despite this similarity, the disk of 55 Cnc was smaller, heavier, and
less rotationally supported than the solar nebula, so this system represents a

where a given computational job is converted to the task of finding the global
minimum of some classical potential energy function and the search for the
global potential minimum is performed by employing external kinetic quantum
fluctuations and subsequent slow reduction (annealing) of them. In this method,
the entire potential energy landscape (PEL) may be accessed simultaneously
through a delocalized wave-function, in contrast to a classical search, where
the searcher has to visit different points in the landscape (i.e., individual
classical configurations) sequentially. Thus in such searches, the role of the
potential energy might be significantly different in the two cases. Here we
discuss this in the context of searching of a single isolated hole (potential
minimum) in a golf-course type gradient free PEL. We show, that the quantum
particle would be able to locate the hole faster if the hole is deeper, while
the classical particle of course would have no scope to exploit the depth of
the hole. We also discuss the effect of the underlying quantum phase transition
on the adiabatic dynamics.

continuous methods for computing the LCEs based on the QR or the singular value

finite--dimensional conservative systems, i. e. autonomous Hamiltonian systems

dissipative systems and time series. The relation of two chaos detection
techniques, namely the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) and the generalized

(RMFSE) of 0.8% at a two-year horizon for the period between 1965 and 2002 (the
best among other inflation forecasting models). This relationship is tested for
cointegration. Both variables are integrated of order one according to the
presence of a unit root in the series and its absence in their first
differences. Two methods of cointegration testing are applied: the
Engle-Granger one based on the unit root test of the residuals including a

time lead and the existence of a cointegrating relation. VAR and VECM

numerous applications of the equation: from purely theoretical - a robust
fundamental relation between macroeconomic and population variables, to a
practical one - an accurate out-of-sample inflation forecasting at a two-year
horizon and a long-term prediction based on labor force projections. The

channel, in the H-alpha line, and even in total radio flux records. Coronal and
Moreton waves were also observed. Multi-spectral data allowed reconstructing an
overall picture of the event. An explosive filament eruption and related
impulsive flare produced a CME and blast shock, both of which decelerated and
propagated independently. Coronal and Moreton waves were kinematically close
and both decelerated in accordance with an expected motion of the coronal blast
shock. The CME did not resemble a classical three-component structure,
probably, because some part of the ejected mass fell back onto the Sun.
Quantitative evaluations from different observations provide close estimates of
the falling mass, ~3 10^15 g, which is close to the estimated mass of the CME.
The falling material was responsible for the observed large-scale absorption
phenomena, in particular, shallow widespread moving dimmings observed at 195 A.
By contrast, deep quasi-stationary dimmings observed in this band near the
eruption center were due to plasma density decrease in coronal structures.

be an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can
be built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead,
pairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the
analysis of small subsystems. Here we ask whether the observations will
generalize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will
provide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show
that, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in
the predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below
the crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large
systems. If the size is above the crossover point, the results do have
predictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining
the extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of
whole biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems
studied so far is below the crossover point.

taking advantage of its instrumentation to specifically monitor the occurrence
of exceptional burst events lasting more than ~10 minutes. Half of the

INTEGRAL. The goal is to derive a comprehensive picture of the relationship
between the nuclear ignition processes and the accretion states of the system
leading up to such long bursts. Depending on the composition of the accreted
material, these bursts may be explained by either the unstable burning of a
large pile of mixed hydrogen and helium, or the ignition of a thick pure helium

accretion rates and make possible to study the transition from a hydrogen-rich
bursting regime to a pure helium regime.

this paper we take a first look on the new models, compare them with previous
modeling attempts and focus on the effects of various parameters on the overall
structure of the SED that leads to the classification of Herbig AeBe stars into
two groups, with a flaring (group I) or self-shadowed (group II) SED. We find
that the parameter of overriding importance to the SED is the total mass in
grains smaller than 25um, confirming the earlier results by Dullemond and
Dominik. All other parameters studied have only minor influences, and will
alter the SED type only in borderline cases. We find that there is no natural
dichotomy between group I and II. From a modeling point of view, the transition
is a continuous function of the small dust mass. We also show that moderate
grain growth produces spectra with weak or no 1um feature, both for flaring
(Group I) and non-flaring (Group II) sources. The fact that sources with weak
features have been found mostly in Group I sources is therefore surprising and
must be due to observational biases or evolutionary effects.

equivalent of Morita type. In this paper, we shall consider the compositions of

from its beginnings until now. The consequences of the apparent differences
between quantum statistics and classical statistics range from the
philosophical interpretations to practical issues as quantum computing. In this
note we demonstrate how quantum mechanics can emerge from classical statistical
systems. We discuss conditions and circumstances for this to happen. Quantum
systems describe isolated subsystems of classical statistical systems with
infinitely many states. While infinitely many classical observables ""measure""
properties of the subsystem and its environment, the state of the subsystem can
be characterized by the expectation values of only a few probabilistic
observables. They define a density matrix, and all the usual laws of quantum
mechanics follow. No concepts beyond classical statistics are needed for
quantum physics - the differences are only apparent and result from the
particularities of those classical statistical systems which admit a quantum
mechanical description. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties
of quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities
within the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the
isolation of the subsystem.

observations resolve the eastern and western nuclei from each other, in both
the molecular line and dust continuum emission. At 435 micron, the peak
intensity of the western nucleus is stronger than the eastern nucleus, and the
difference in peak intensities is less than at longer wavelengths. Fitting a
simple model to the dust emission observed between 1.3 mm and 435 micron
suggests that dust emissivity power law index in the western nucleus is near
unity and steeper in the eastern nucleus, about 2, and that the dust emission
is optically thick at the shorter wavelength. Comparison with single dish
measurements indicate that the interferometer observations are missing ~60% of
the dust emission, most likely from a spatially extended component to which
these observations are not sensitive. The 12CO J=6-5 line observations clearly
resolve kinematically the two nuclei. The distribution and kinematics of the
12CO J=6-5 line appear to be very similar to lower J CO lies observed at
similar resolution. Analysis of multiple 12CO line intensities indicates that
the molecular gas in both nuclei have similar excitation conditions, although
the western nucleus is warmer and denser. The excitation conditions are similar
to those found in other extreme environments, including M82, Mrk 231, and BR

$|y^{J/\psi,\gamma}|<$3) is enhanced by a factor of about 2.0, and the
differential cross section can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude in the
large transverse momentum region of $J/\psi$. Furthermore, the polarization of
$J/\psi$ changes from transverse polarization at leading-order to longitudinal
polarization at NLO. For the inclusive $J/\psi$ hadroproduction, it is known
that the color-octet contributions are one order of magnitude larger than the
color-singlet contribution, and the polarization distribution is dominated by
the color-octet behavior at NLO. In contrast, for $J/\psi+\gamma$ production
the color-singlet contribution is of the same order as the color-octet
contribution, and the polarization distribution arises from both the
color-singlet and color-octet. Therefore, measurements of $J/\psi$ production
associated with a direct photon at the hadron collider could be an important
supplement to testify the theoretical framework treating with the heavy
quarkonium. In addition, an NLO QCD correction to $\Upsilon+\gamma$ production
at the LHC is also presented in this paper.

The notion of regular function of a

developed into a quite rich theory. Several properties of regular quaternionic
functions are analogous to those of holomorphic functions of one complex
variable, although the diversity of the quaternionic setting introduces new
phenomena. This paper studies regular quaternionic transformations. We first
find a quaternionic analog to the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem and prove that
all regular injective functions from H to itself are affine. In particular, the
group Aut(H) of biregular functions on H coincides with the group of regular
affine transformations. Inspired by the classical quaternionic linear
fractional transformations, we define the regular fractional transformations.
We then show that each regular injective function from the Alexandroff
compactification of H to itself is a regular fractional transformation.
Finally, we study regular Moebius transformations, which map the unit ball B
onto itself. All regular bijections from B to itself prove to be regular
Moebius transformations.

or x-ray laser radiation is operated in conjunction with the LHC. We discuss
the relative effectiveness of protons versus Pb ions and specify for each pair
production channel the most suitable collision system.
