accelerates away, infinite spacelike surfaces of homogeneity develop to the
future of the collision; this strongly suggests that observers can have
collisions to their past, and previous results then imply that this is very
likely. However, for observers at nearly all locations, the restoration of
homogeneity relegates any observable effects to a vanishingly small region on
the sky. We find that bubble collisions may also play an important role in
defining measures in inflation: a potentially infinite relative volume factor
arises between two bubble types depending on the sign of the acceleration of

The
radiation at $\sim 5$ GHz is quite steady and optically thin, consisting on a
dominant core plus an extended jet-like structure. There is a spectral turnover
around 1 GHz, and evidence of variability at timescales of 1 yr at 234 MHz. We
investigate the radio emitter properties using the available broadband radio
data, and assuming two possible scenarios to explain the turnover: free-free
absorption in the stellar wind, or synchrotron self-absorption. We use the
relationships between the turnover frequency, the stellar wind density, the
emitter location, size and magnetic field, and the Lorentz factor of the
emitting electrons, as well as a reasonable assumption on the energy budget, to
infer the properties of the low-frequency radio emitter. Also, we put this
information in context with the broadband radio data. The location and size of
the low-frequency radio emitter can be restricted to $\ga$ few AU from the
primary star, its magnetic field to $\sim 3\times 10^{-3}-1$ G, and the
electron Lorentz factors to $\sim 10-100$. The observed variability of the
extended structures seen with VLBA would point to electron bulk velocities $\ga
3\times 10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$, whereas much less variable radiation at 5 GHz would
indicate velocities for the VLBA core $\la 10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$. The emission at
234 MHz in the high state would mostly come from a region larger than the
dominant broadband radio emitter. We suggest a scenario in which secondary
pairs, created via gamma-ray absorption and moving in the stellar wind, are
behind the steady broadband radio core, whereas the resolved jet-like radio
emission would come from a collimated, faster, outflow.

critical boundary between ordered and disordered dynamical regimes. Here, we
review models of evolving dynamical networks that lead to self-organization of
network topology based on a local coupling between a dynamical order parameter
and rewiring of network connectivity, with convergence towards criticality in
the limit of large network size $N$. In particular, two adaptive schemes are
discussed and compared in the context of Boolean Networks and Threshold
Networks: 1) Active nodes loose links, frozen nodes aquire new links, 2) Nodes
with correlated activity connect, de-correlated nodes disconnect. These simple
local adaptive rules lead to co-evolution of network topology and -dynamics.
Adaptive networks are strikingly different from random networks: They evolve
inhomogeneous topologies and broad plateaus of homeostatic regulation,
dynamical activity exhibits $1/f$ noise and attractor periods obey a scale-free
distribution. The proposed co-evolutionary mechanism of topological
self-organization is robust against noise and does not depend on the details of
dynamical transition rules. Using finite-size scaling, it is shown that
networks converge to a self-organized critical state in the thermodynamic
limit. Finally, we discuss open questions and directions for future research,
and outline possible applications of these models to adaptive systems in
diverse areas.

expansion rate in a model independent way. Specifically, we study if the
expansion was decelerating at high redshifts and is accelerating now, without
referring to any model for the energy content of the universe, nor to any
specific theory of gravity. This differs from most studies of the expansion
rate which, e.g., assumes some underlying parameterised model for the dark
energy component of the universe. To accomplish this, we have devised a new
method to probe the expansion rate without relying on such assumptions.
  Using only supernova data, we conclude that there is little doubt that the
universe has been accelerating at late times. However, contrary to some
previous claims, we can not determine if the universe was previously
decelerating. For a variety of methods used for constraining the expansion
history of the universe, acceleration is detected from supernovae alone at >5
sigma, regardless of the curvature of the universe. Specifically, using a
Taylor expansion of the scale factor, acceleration today is detected at >12
sigma. If we also include the ratio of the scale of the baryon acoustic
oscillations as imprinted in the cosmic microwave background and in the large
scale distribution of galaxies, it is evident from the data that the expansion
decelerated at high redshifts, but only with the assumption of a flat or
negatively curved universe.

R.A. (2000) =18h45m01s.4 and Dec. = -04deg33'57''.7 (uncertainty 2'').
Variability factors of 50 are observed on time scale as short as hundreds of
seconds. The broad-band high-energy spectrum is typical of wind-fed accreting
pulsars with an intrinsic absorption of NH=(2.6+/-0.2)e22 cm-2, a hard
continuum of Gamma=(0.7-0.9)+/-0.1 and a high-energy cutoff at Ecut=16+/-3 keV.

temperature of kT=0.18+/-0.05 keV. Optically-thin and highly-ionised iron (Fe
XVIII-XIX) located near the supergiant star is detected during the quiescence

GRB050922C, obtained with UVES/VLT 3.5 hours after the GRB event. We found
that, as for most high resolution spectra of GRBs, the spectrum of the
afterglow of GRB050922C is complex. At least seven components contribute to the
main absorption system at z=2.1992. The detection of lines of neutral elements
like MgI and the detection of fine-structure levels of the ions FeII, SiII and
CII allows us to separate components in the GRB ISM along the line of sight.
Moreover, in addition to the main system, we have analyzed the five intervening
systems between z = 2.077 and z = 1.5664 identified along the GRB line of
sight. GRB afterglow spectra are very complex, but full of information. This
can be used to disentangle the contribution of the different parts of the GRB
host galaxy and to study their properties. Our metallicity estimates agree with
the scenario of GRBs exploding in low metallicity galaxies

In particular, we concentrate on the different types of interaction between the
inflowing wind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when
accretion of matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these
include inhibition by the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. We show that very
large luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as short as hours) can
result from transitions across different regimes. This scenario is then applied
to the activity displayed by supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs), a new
class of high mass X-ray binaries in our galaxy recently discovered with
INTEGRAL. According to this interpretation we argue that SFXTs which display
very large luminosity swings and host a slowly spinning neutron star are
expected to be characterized by magnetar-like fields. Supergiant fast X-ray
transients might thus provide a unique opportunity to detect and study
accreting magnetars in binary systems.

high-energy p-A collisions is expected to display an extremum at a transverse
momentum around the saturation scale. This was first observed within the
context of the McLerran-Venugopalan model which has an x-independent saturation
scale. The extremum arises due to the k_t-odd nature of the polarization
dependent fragmentation function, which probes approximately the derivative of
the dipole scattering amplitude. The amplitude changes most strongly around the
saturation scale, resulting in a peak in the polarization. We find that the
observation also extends to the more realistic case in which the saturation
scale Q_s is x dependent. Since a range of x and therefore Q_s values is probed
at a given transverse momentum and rapidity, this result is a priori not
expected. Moreover, the measurement of Lambda polarization over a range of x_F
values actually provides a direct probe of the x dependence of the saturation
scale. This novel feature is demonstrated for typical LHC kinematics and for
several phenomenological models of the dipole scattering amplitude. We show
that although the measurement will be challenging, it may be feasible at LHC.
The situation at RHIC is not favorable, because the peak will likely be at too
low transverse momentum of the Lambda to be a trustworthy measure of the
saturation scale.

compensate for the revision of the composition. By comparing models computed

Models are computed with the opacity thus modified and used as reference in
helioseismic inversions to determine the difference between the solar and model
sound speed. An opacity increase varying from around 30 per cent near the base
of the convection zone to a few percent in the solar core results in a

translocation time that non-equilibrium molecular conformations can be ignored.
In this paper, we use Molecular Dynamics simulations to directly test this
hypothesis by looking at the escape time of unbiased polymer chains starting
with different initial conditions. We find that the translocation process is
not quite in equilibrium for the systems studied, even though the translocation
time tau is about 10 times larger than the relaxation time tau_r. Our most
striking result is the observation that the last half of the chain escapes in
less than ~12% of the total escape time, which implies that there is a large

astrophysical sources in the universe. This paper describes our Taskforce's
work on massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs). Given present uncertainties in the
formation history of MBHBs, we adopt four different population models, based on
(i) whether the initial black-hole seeds are small or large, and (ii) whether
accretion is efficient or inefficient at spinning up the holes. We compare four
largely independent codes for calculating LISA's parameter-estimation
capabilities. All codes are based on the Fisher-matrix approximation, but in
the past they used somewhat different signal models, source parametrizations
and noise curves. We show that once these differences are removed, the four
codes give results in extremely close agreement with each other. Using a code
that includes both spin precession and higher harmonics in the
gravitational-wave signal, we carry out Monte Carlo simulations and determine
the number of events that can be detected and accurately localized in our four
population models.

aspects of four different kinds of correlations: local, partially-local,

these correlations have been used to study how they are related and how they
can be discerned via Bell-type inequalities that give non-trivial bounds on the

correlations that are more pronounced as compared to the fully screened Kondo
effect; their power-law decay is weaker because of characteristic logarithmic
corrections at large distances. The spin correlator also changes sign as a
function of distance to the impurity allowing for ferromagnetic correlations
between conduction electron spin density and the local moment. The numerical
findings are shown to be in agreement with the predictions deriving from an
effective ferromagnetic Kondo Hamiltonian.

find poles in retarded Green functions of boundary CFTs on $R^{1,d-1}$ and
$RxS^{d-1}$. We find that when the boundary theory is perturbed by an operator
of dimension $\Delta>> 1$, the relaxation time back to equilibrium is given at
zero momentum by ${1 \over \Delta \pi T} << {1 \over \pi T}$. Turning on a
large spatial momentum can significantly increase it. For a generic scalar
operator in a CFT on $R^{1,d-1}$, there exists a sequence of poles near the
lightcone whose imaginary part scales with momentum as $p^{-{d-2 \over d+2}}$

hydrodynamical star cluster formation simulations of Bate et al., and Bate &
Bonnell, but we use a realistic gas equation of state and radiative transfer in
the flux-limited diffusion approximation rather than the original barotropic
equation of state.
  Whereas star formation in the barotropic simulations continued unabated until
the simulation was stopped, we find that radiative feedback essentially
terminates the production of new objects after roughly one local dynamical
time. Radiative feedback also dramatically decreases the propensity of massive
circumstellar discs to fragment and inhibits fragmentation of other dense gas
(e.g. filaments) close to existing protostellar objects. These two effects
decrease the numbers of protostars formed by a factor of approximately 4.
Whereas the original simulations produced more brown dwarfs than stars, the
radiative feedback results in a ratio of stars to brown dwarfs of approximately
5:1, in much better agreement with observations. Most importantly, we find that
although the characteristic stellar mass in the original calculations scaled
linearly with the initial mean Jeans mass, when radiative feedback is included
the characteristic stellar mass is indistinguishable for the two calculations.
We thus propose that the reason the observed initial mass function appears to
be universal is due to self-regulation of the star formation process by
radiative feedback. We present an analytic argument showing how a
characteristic mass may be derived that is relatively independent of initial
conditions such as the cloud's density. (Abridged)

latter can be identified, among other possibilities, as ""late prompt"" emission
produced by a long lived central engine with mechanisms similar to those
responsible for the production of the ""standard"" early prompt radiation. Apart
from flares or re-brightenings, that we do not model, we find a good agreement
with the data, despite of their complexity and diversity. Although based in
part on a phenomenological model with a relatively large number of free
parameters, we believe that our findings are a first step towards the
construction of a more physical scenario. Our approach allows us to interpret
the behaviour of the optical and X-ray afterglows in a coherent way, by a
relatively simple scenario. Within this context it is possible to explain why
sometimes no jet break is observed; why, even if a jet break is observed, it is
often chromatic; why the steepening after the jet break time is often shallower
than predicted. Finally, the decay slope of the late prompt emission after the
shallow phase is found to be remarkably similar to the time profile expected by
the accretion rate of fall-back material (i.e. proportional to t^{-5/3}),
suggesting that this can be the reason why the central engine can be active for

ionized gas, exhibiting an additional broad bump peaked at ~40 GHz which
provides ~20% of the peak intensity. We confirm that the bump is consistent
with a modified Draine & Lazarian (1998) spinning dust model, though the peak

This frequency shift results from systematic errors in the large-scale modes of

show that the bump is not the result of errors in the Halpha template by
analyzing regions of high free-free intensity, where the WMAP K-band map may be
used as the free-free template. We rule out a pure free-free spectrum for the
Halpha-correlated emission at high confidence: ~27sigma for the nearly full-sky
fit, even after marginalizing over the CMB cross-correlation bias. We also
extend the previous analysis by searching the parameter space of the Draine &
Lazarian model but letting the amplitude float. The best fit for reasonable
values of the characteristic electric dipole moment and density requires an
amplitude factor of ~0.3. This suggests that small PAHs in the warm ionized

bright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initial
spike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short Swift events.
In spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart is
extraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at
~1 hr after the BAT trigger. The optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and then
falls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of Li & Paczynski (1998)
for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. However, a
shallow spectral index and similar evolution in X-rays inferred from Chandra
observations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. The extreme
faintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emission
argues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a ""naked"" GRB),
consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deep
HST imaging. Our observations reinforce the notion that short GRBs generally
occur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in some
cases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that of
the short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this class
of events. Because most previous BAT short bursts without observed extended
emission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if it
were present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observed

Ks-band data have indeed the advantage of probing old stellar populations for

recent star formation. In paper I we presented a new non-parametric method to
quantify morphologies of galaxies on seeing limited images based on support
vector machines. Here we use this method to classify $\sim$$50 000$ $Ks$
selected galaxies in the COSMOS area observed with WIRCam at CFHT. The obtained
classification is used to investigate the redshift distributions and number
counts per morphological type up to $z\sim2$ and to compare to the results
obtained with HST/ACS in the I-band on the same objects from other works. We
associate to every galaxy with $Ks<21.5$ and $z<2$ a probability between 0 and
1 of being late-type or early-type. The classification is found to be reliable
up to $z\sim2$. The mean probability is $p\sim0.8$. It decreases with redshift
and with size, especially for the early-type population but remains above
$p\sim0.7$. The classification is globally in good agreement with the one
obtained using HST/ACS for $z<1$. Above $z\sim1$, the I-band classification
tends to find less early-type galaxies than the Ks-band one by a factor
$\sim$1.5 which might be a consequence of morphological k-correction effects.
We argue therefore that studies based on I-band HST/ACS classifications at
$z>1$ could be underestimating the elliptical population. [abridged]

explosions are intrinsically 3-dimensional phenomena with significant
departures from spherical symmetry. We review the evidence derived from
spectropolarimetry that has established several key results: virtually all
supernovae are significantly aspherical near maximum light; core-collapse
supernovae behave differently than thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae; the
asphericity of core-collapse supernovae is stronger in the inner layers showing
that the explosion process itself is strongly aspherical; core-collapse
supernovae tend to establish a preferred direction of asymmetry; the
asphericity is stronger in the outer layers of thermonuclear supernovae
providing constraints on the burning process. We emphasize the utility of the
Q/U plane as a diagnostic tool and revisit SN 1987A and SN 1993J in a
contemporary context. An axially-symmetric geometry can explain many basic
features of core-collapse supernovae, but significant departures from axial
symmetry are needed to explain most events. We introduce a spectropolarimetry
type to classify the range of behavior observed in polarized supernovae.
Understanding asymmetries in supernovae is important for phenomena as diverse
as the origins of gamma-ray bursts and the cosmological applications of Type Ia
supernovae in studies of the dark energy content of the universe.

superconductors seem to imply two paradoxes. The first paradox concerns the
apparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear
signature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no
evidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the
frequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the
Fermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming
that Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number
of charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these
apparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address
the first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to
correlated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the
materials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral
function is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate
range of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole
pocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer
matrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder
affects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,
when, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,
it wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are
correct, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and
even higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency.

both IRAC and MIPS instruments for five large, nearby molecular clouds. This
paper combines information drawn from studies of individual clouds into a
combined and updated statistical analysis of star formation rates and
efficiencies, numbers and lifetimes for SED classes, and clustering properties.
Current star formation efficiencies range from 3% to 6%. Taken together, the
five clouds are producing about 260 solar masses of stars per Myr. The star
formation surface density is more than an order of magnitude larger than would
be predicted from the Kennicutt relation used in extragalactic studies.
Measured against the dense gas probed by the maps of dust continuum emission,
the efficiencies are much higher, and the current stock of dense cores would be
exhausted in 1.8 Myr on average. The derived lifetime for the Class I phase is
0.44 to 0.54 Myr, considerably longer than some estimates. Similarly, the
lifetime for the Class 0 SED class, 0.10 to 0.16 Myr, is longer than early
estimates. The great majority (90%) of young stars lie within loose clusters
with at least 35 members and a stellar density of 1 solar mass per cubic pc.
Accretion at the sound speed from an isothermal sphere over the lifetime
derived for the Class I phase could build a star of about 0.25 solar masses,
given an efficiency of 0.3. Our data confirm and aggravate the ""luminosity
problem"" for protostars. Our results strongly suggest that accretion is time
variable, with prolonged periods of very low accretion. Based on a very simple
model and this sample of sources, half the mass of a star would be accreted
during only 7% of the Class I lifetime, as represented by the eight most
luminous objects.

The total density distribution evolves from a Gauss-like Bose distribution to a

true even in the experimental situation. In addition the numerical results show

the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in
much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or
scalar Laplacian. We study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge
theory: we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be
resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the
L2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the
validity of the global ranking obtained -- if this is large, then the data does
not have a meaningful global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further
decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow
(locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether
inconsistency arises locally or globally. An obvious advantage over the NP-hard
Kemeny optimization is that discrete Hodge decomposition may be computed via a
linear least squares regression. We also investigated the L1-projection of edge
flows, showing that this is dual to correlation maximization over bounded

that an accuracy of 0.035 to 0.05 mag can be achieved by using calibrations
derived in this paper. The color terms are strongest for very red objects, e.g.
for objects with (r'-z')=3.0 the resulting z' magnitudes will be ~0.35 mag too

  The histograms of magnetic field strength(B), inclination angle(i), and
Doppler velocity(v) of UDs showed a center-to-limb variation. Observed at disk
center, UDs had (1)slightly smaller field strength (Delta B=-17 Gauss) and
(2)relative blue shifts (Delta v=28 m s-1) compared to their surroundings. When
the sunspot got close to the limb, UDs and their surroundings showed almost no
difference in the magnetic and Doppler values. This center-to-limb variation
can be understood by the formation height difference in a cusp-shaped
magnetized atmosphere around UDs, due to the weakly magnetized hot gas
intrusion. In addition, some UDs showed oscillatory light curves with multiple
peaks around 10 min, which may indicate the presence of the oscillatory
convection. We discuss our results in the frameworks of two theoretical models,

beam-limiting and beam-shaping devices in proton planning. Two types of
corrections are considered: those which are due to the nonzero thickness of
such devices (geometrical effects) and those relating to the scattering of beam
particles off their material. The application of these two types of corrections
is greatly facilitated by decomposing the physical effects (i.e., the
contribution to the fluence) of two-dimensional objects (i.e., of the apertures
of the devices) into one-dimensional, easily-calculable contributions. To
minimise the time requirements in the derivation of the scattering corrections,
a two-step process is introduced. The first step occurs at beam-configuration
phase and comprises the analysis of half-block fluence measurements and the
extraction of the one parameter of the model which is used in the description
of the beamline characteristics; subsequently, a number of Monte-Carlo runs
lead to the determination of the parameters of a convenient parameterisation of
the relevant fluence contributions. The second step involves (at planning time)
the reconstruction of the parameters (which are used in the description of the
scattering contributions) via simple interpolations, performed on the results
obtained during the beam-configuration phase. It is shown that the inclusion of
the scattering effects leads to substantial improvement in the reproduction of
the experimental data. The contributions from the block-thickness and
block-scattering effects have been presented separately in the case of a simple
water phantom. In this example, the maximal contribution of the block-relating
effects amounts to a few percent of the prescribed dose.

  In the context of magnetohydrodynamics, we study the torsional oscillations
and energy extraction from a new-born, hot, differentially rotating quark star.
  The new-born compact star is a rapid rotator that produces a relativistic,
leptonic wind. The star's torsional oscillation modulates this wind emission
considerably when it is odd and of sufficient amplitude, which is relatively
easy to reach. Odd oscillations may occur just after the formation of a quark
star. Other asymmetries can cause similar effects. The buoyancy of wound-up
magnetic fields is inhibited, or its effects are limited, by a variety of
different mechanisms. Direct electromagnetic emission by the torsional
oscillation in either an outside vacuum or the leptonic wind surrounding the
compact object is found to be insignificant. In contrast, the twist given to
the outer magnetic field by an odd torsional oscillation is generally
sufficient to open the star's magnetosphere. The Poynting emission of the star
in its leptonic environment is then radiated from all of its surface and is
enhanced considerably during these open episodes, tapping at the bulk
rotational energy of the star. This results in intense energy shedding in the
first tens of minutes after the collapse of magnetized quark stars with an
initial poloidal field of order of 10**14 Gauss, sufficient to explain long
gamma-ray bursts.

common. The stellar disks in nearly 30 % of galaxies have significant
lopsidedness, greater than 10 % measured as the Fourier amplitude of the m=1
component normalized to the average value. This asymmetry is traced
particularly well by the atomic hydrogen gas distribution lying in the outer
parts. The lopsidedness also occurs in the nuclear regions, where the nucleus
is offset with respect to the outer isophotes. The galaxies in a group
environment show higher lopsidedness. The origin of lopsidedness could be due
to the disk response to a tidally distorted halo, or via gas accretion. The
lopsidedness has a large impact on the dynamics of the galaxy, its evolution,
the star formation in it, and on the growth of the central black hole and on
the nuclear fueling, merging of binary black holes etc. The disk lopsidedness
can be used as a diagnostic to study the halo asymmetry. This is an emerging

to receive considerable interest. The question whether the physics of the

scenario, i.e. by correlation or band effects, is still under debate. A recent
cluster dynamical mean field theory calculation [Biermann et al, Phys. Rev.
Lett., 94, 026404 (2005)] suggests a combination of both effects,
characterizing the transition as of a correlation assisted Peierls type. In
this paper we present a detailed analysis of the excitation spectrum of the
insulating M1 phase of VO2, based on this calculation. We implement a scheme to
analytically continue self-energies from Matsubara to real frequencies, and
study the physics of the strong interactions, as well as the corresponding
changes with respect to the density functional theory (LDA) band structure. We
find that in the M1 phase life-time effects are rather negligible, indeed
allowing for an effective band structure description. A frequency independent
but orbital dependent potential, constructed as an approximation to the full
cluster dynamical mean field self-energy, turns out to satisfactory reproduce
the fully interacting one-particle spectrum, acting as a scissors operator
which pushes the a1g bonding and egp bands apart and, thus, opening the gap.

flows which has been studied extensively by various authors. Their rich
structure allows for explicit calculations in several situations and makes them
a natural object to start with if one wants to study more general stochastic
flows. Often the intuition gained by understanding the problem in the context
of IBFs transfers to more general situations. However, the obvious link between
stochastic flows, random dynamical systems and ergodic theory cannot be
exploited in its full strength as the IBF does not have an invariant
probability measure but rather an infinite one. Isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
flows are in a sense localized IBFs and do have an invariant probability
measure. The imposed linear drift destroys the translation invariance of the
IBF, but many other important structure properties like the Markov property of
the distance process remain valid and allow for explicit calculations in
certain situations. The fact that isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows have
invariant probability measures allows one to apply techniques from random
dynamical systems theory. We demonstrate this by applying the results of
Ledrappier and Young to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the statistical

interacting by scalar exchange particles are calculated. In contrast to
two-body systems, the three-body binding energies obtained in these two
approaches differ significantly from each other: the ladder kernel in
light-front dynamics underbinds by approximately a factor of two compared to
the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. By taking into account three-body forces in

find that most of this difference disappears; for small exchange masses, the
obtained binding energies coincide with each other.

numerically largest slope above the loss peak frequency). The data consisting
of 347 spectra for 53 liquids show prevalence of minimum slopes close to -1/2,
corresponding to approximate square-root-time dependence of the dielectric
relaxation function at short times. The paper further studies possible
correlations between minimum slopes and: 1) Temperature quantified via the
loss-peak frequency; 2) How well an inverse power law fits data above the loss
peak; 3) Degree of time-temperature superposition; 4) Loss-peak half width; 5)
Deviation from non-Arrhenius behavior; 6) Loss strength. For the first three
points we find correlations that indicate a special status of liquids with
minimum slopes close to -1/2. For the last three points only fairly
insignificant correlations are found with the exception of large-loss liquids,
which have minimum slopes that are numerically significantly larger than 1/2

described using standing waves resulting from the fixed boundary conditions

predicted by the standard treatments using running waves (Bloch states)
resulting from the cyclic boundary conditions (CBCs). It is shown that, while
the total number of eigenenergies in a miniband is the same according to both
treatments, the number of different energies is twice higher according to the
FBCs. It is also shown that the wave vector values corresponding to the
eigenenergies are spaced twice as densely for the FBCs as for the CBCs. The
reason is that a running wave is characterized by a single value of wave vector
k, while a standing wave in a finite SL is characterized by a pair of
wavevectors +/- q. Using numerical solutions of the Schroedinger equation for
an electron in an increasing number N of periodic quantum wells (beginning with
N = 2) we investigate the ""birth"" of an energy miniband and of a Brillouin zone
according to the two approaches. Using the Fourier transforms of the computed
wave functions for a few quantum wells we follow the ""birth"" of electron's
momentum. It turns out that the latter can be discerned already for a system of
two wells. We show that the number of higher values of the wave vector q
involved in an eigenenergy state is twice higher for a standing wave with FBCs

luminosity is 1.1-2.6x10^36 erg s-1 in the 20-100 keV energy range. This low
outburst luminosity and the long-term time-average accretion rate of
~5x10^-12Msolar/yr suggest that SAXJ 1810.8-2609 is a faint soft X-ray
transient. During the flux increase, spectra are consistent with a thermal
Comptonization model with a temperature plasma of ~23-30 keV and an optical
depth of ~1.2-1.5, independent from luminosity of the system. This is a typical
low hard spectral state for which the X-ray emission is attributed to the
upscattering of soft seed photons by a hot, optically thin electron plasma.
During the decay, spectra have a different shape, the high energy tail being
compatible with a single power law. This confirm similar behavior observed by
BeppoSAX during the previous outburst, with absence of visible cutoff in the
hard X-ray spectrum. INTEGRAL/JEM-X instrument observed four X-ray bursts in
Fall 2007. The first one has the highest peak flux (~3.5Crab in 3--25 keV)

LEdd~3.8x10^38 erg s^-1. The observed recurrence time of ~1.2 days and the
ratio of the total energy emitted in the persistent flux to that emitted in the

hydrogen and helium with X>0.4.

emission of radio components in relativistic jets. We have developed an
algorithm (SPEV) for the transport of a population of non-thermal electrons
including radiative losses. For large values of the ratio of gas pressure to
magnetic field energy density, \ab \sim 6\times 10^4, quiescent jet models show
substantial spectral evolution, with observational consequences only above
radio frequencies. Larger values of the magnetic field (\ab \sim 6\times 10^2),
such that synchrotron losses are moderately important at radio frequencies,
present a larger ratio of shocked-to-unshocked regions brightness than the
models without radiative losses, despite the fact that they correspond to the
same underlying hydrodynamic structure. We also show that jets with a positive
photon spectral index result if the lower limit \gamma_min of the non-thermal
particle energy distribution is large enough. A temporary increase of the
Lorentz factor at the jet inlet produces a traveling perturbation that appears
in the synthetic maps as a superluminal component. We show that trailing
components can be originated not only in pressure matched jets, but also in
over-pressured ones, where the existence of recollimation shocks does not allow
for a direct identification of such features as Kelvin-Helmholtz modes, and its
observational imprint depends on the observing frequency. If the magnetic field
is large (\ab \sim 6\times 10^2), the spectral index in the rarefaction
trailing the traveling perturbation does not change much with respect to the
same model without any hydrodynamic perturbation. If the synchrotron losses are
considered the spectral index displays a smaller value than in the
corresponding region of the quiescent jet model.

The primary energy release in solar flares is almost certainly due
to magnetic reconnection, making this a strong candidate as a mechanism for
particle acceleration. While particle acceleration in 2D geometries has been
widely studied, investigations in 3D are a recent development. Two main classes
of reconnection regimes at a 3D magnetic null point have been identified: fan
and spine reconnection Aims. Here we investigate particle trajectories and
acceleration during reconnection at a 3D null point, using a test particle
numerical code, and compare the efficiency of the fan and spine regimes in
generating an energetic particle population. Methods. We calculated the time
evolution of the energy spectra. We discuss the geometry of particle escape
from the two configurations and characterise the trapped and escaped
populations. Results. We find that fan reconnection is less efficent than spine
reconnection in providing seed particles to the region of strong electric field
where acceleration is possible. The establishment of a steady-state spectrum
requires approximately double the time in fan reconnection. The steady-state
energy spectrum at intermediate energies (protons 1 keV to 0.1 MeV) is
comparable in the fan and spine regimes. While in spine reconnection particle
escape takes place in two symmetric jets along the spine, in fan reconnection
no jets are produced and particles escape in the fan plane, in a ribbon-like
structure.

Arcturus, but fit the warmer stars well. The variance among independent
measurements of the solar irradiance in the near UV is sufficiently large that
we cannot definitely conclude that models predict too much near UV flux, in

hypothesizing that there is still missing continuous thermal extinction, and
that the missing near UV extinction becomes more important with decreasing

resistivity (rho) vs. temperature (T) plot for the parent compound is
suppressed by the doping of each TM element. Furthermore, Co- and Ni-doping
(CaFe1-xTMxAsF, TM = Co, Ni) induces superconductivity with a transition
temperature maximized at the nominal x = 0.10 for Co (22 K) and at x = 0.05 for

Ni2+(3d8) adds double electrons to the FeAs layers compared with Co2+ (3d7).
Increased x for Co or Ni breaks the superconductivity while metallic nature
drho/dT > 0 is still kept. These observations indicate that Co and Ni work as

superconductivity, yielding drho/dT < 0 in the below the rho-T anomaly

theorem, is the full orthogonal group. We only use geometric methods and we do
not use any classification (not even that of transitive isometric actions on
the sphere or the list of rank one symmetric spaces). This result was
independently proved, by using an algebraic approach, by Paul-Andy Nagy. We
apply this theorem to prove that the canonical connection of a compact
naturally reductive space is unique, provided the space does not split off,
locally, a sphere or a compact Lie group with a bi-invariant metric. From this
it follows easily how to obtain the full isometry group of a naturally
reductive space. This generalizes known classification results of Onishchick,
for normal homogeneous spaces with simple group of isometries, and Shankar, for
homogeneous spaces of positive curvature. This also answers a question posed by
J. Wolf and Wang-Ziller. Namely, to explain why the presentation group of an
isotropy irreducible space, strongly or not, cannot be enlarged (unless for
spheres, or for compact simple Lie groups with a bi-invariant metric).

optically-trapped strongly interacting Fermi gas, including the energy $E$,
entropy $S$, and sound velocity $c$. Our model-independent measurements of $E$
and $S$ enable a precision study of the finite temperature thermodynamics. The
$E(S)$ data are directly compared to several recent predictions. The
temperature in both the superfluid and normal fluid regime is obtained from the
fundamental thermodynamic relation $T=\partial E/\partial S$ by parameterizing
the $E(S)$ data. Our $E(S)$ data are also used to experimentally calibrate the
endpoint temperatures obtained for adiabatic sweeps of the magnetic field
between the ideal and strongly interacting regimes. This enables the first
experimental calibration of the temperature scale used in experiments on
fermionic pair condensation. Our calibration shows that the ideal gas
temperature measured for the onset of pair condensation corresponds closely to
the critical temperature estimated in the strongly interacting regime from the
fits to our $E(S)$ data. The results are in very good agreement with recent
predictions. Finally, using universal thermodynamic relations, we estimate the
chemical potential and heat capacity of the trapped gas from the $E(S)$ data.

ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) cluster along the supergalactic plane
and correlate with active galactic nuclei (AGN) within ~100 Mpc. The
association of several events with the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A supports
the paradigm that UHECRs are powered by supermassive black-hole engines and
accelerated to ultra-high energies in the shocks formed by variable plasma
winds in the inner jets of radio galaxies. The GZK horizon length of 75 EeV
UHECR protons is ~100 Mpc, so that the Auger results are consistent with an
assumed proton composition of the UHECRs. In this scenario, the sources of
UHECRs are FR II radio galaxies and FR I galaxies like Cen A with scattered
radiation fields that enhance UHECR neutral-beam production. Radio galaxies
with jets pointed away from us can still be observed as UHECR sources due to
deflection of UHECRs by magnetic fields in the radio lobes of these galaxies. A
broadband ~1 MeV -- 10 EeV radiation component in the spectra of blazar AGN is
formed by UHECR-induced cascade radiation in the extragalactic background light
(EBL). This emission is too faint to be seen from Cen A, but could be detected
from more luminous blazars.

of radioactive atoms. After discussing a model of the trapping process in a
vapor cell and its efficiency, we present the results of detailed experimental
studies on Rb MOTs. Three spherical cells of different sizes were used. These
cells can be easily replaced, while keeping the rest of the apparatus
unchanged: atomic sources, vacuum conditions, magnetic field gradients, sizes
and power of the laser beams, detection system. By direct comparison, we find
that the trapping efficiency only weakly depends on the MOT cell size. It is
also found that the trapping efficiency of the MOT with the smallest cell,
whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the trapping beams, is about 40%
smaller than the efficiency of larger cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate
the importance of two factors: a long coated tube at the entrance of the MOT
cell, used instead of a diaphragm; and the passivation with an alkali vapor of
the coating on the cell walls, in order to minimize the losses of trappable
atoms. These results guided us in the construction of an efficient
large-diameter cell, which has been successfully employed for on-line trapping
of Fr isotopes at INFN's national laboratories in Legnaro, Italy.

(0.8 to 2.5um) of the EXor variables. These are the initial results (obtained
during the period 2007-2008) from a long term photometric and spectroscopic
program aimed to study the variability in the accretion processes of pre-Main
Sequence (PMS) stars, by correlating the continuum fluctuations with the
spectroscopical properties. Eight sources have been observed in different
epochs, for a total of 25 acquired spectra. EXor spectra show a wide variety of
emission features dominated by HI recombination (Paschen and Brackett series).
We have investigated whether line and continuum variability could be due to a
variable extinction, but such hypothesis is applicable only to the peculiar
source PV Cep. By comparing the observed spectra with a wind model, mass loss
rates in the range (2-10)x10^(-8) M_sun} yr^(-1) are derived, along with other
wind parameters. Consistent results are also obtained by assuming that HI lines
are due to accretion. CO overtone is also detected in the majority of the
sources both in absorption and in emission. It appears to come from regions
more compact than winds, likely the stellar photosphere (when in absorption)
and the circumstellar disk (when in emission). NaI and CaI IR lines behave as
the CO does, thus they are thought to arise in the same locations. For some
targets multiple spectra correspond to different activity stages of the source.
Those exhibiting the largest continuum variation at 2um (DeltaK > 1 mag)
present a significant line flux fading during the continuum declining phases.
In particular, CO absorption (emission) appears associated to inactive (active)
stages, respectively.
