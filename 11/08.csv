molecular gas, viewed roughly edge on, which is excited by the light from the

originate from such interfaces, so the Bar serves as a foundation test of any
emission model. Here we combine X-ray, optical, IR and radio data sets to
derive emission spectra along the transition from H+ to H0 to H2 regions. We
then reproduce the spectra of these layers with a simulation that
simultaneously accounts for the detailed microphysics of the gas, the grains,
and molecules, especially H2 and CO. The magnetic field, observed to be the
dominant pressure in another region of the Orion Nebula, is treated as a free
parameter, along with the density of cosmic rays. Our model successfully
accounts for the optical, IR and radio observations across the Bar by including
a significant magnetic pressure and also heating by an excess density of cosmic
rays, which we suggest is due to cosmic rays being trapped in the compressed
magnetic field. In the Orion Bar, as we had previously found in M17, momentum
carried by radiation and winds from the newly formed stars pushes back and
compresses the surrounding gas. There is a rough balance between outward
momentum in starlight and the total pressure in atomic and molecular gas
surrounding the H+ region. If the gas starts out with a weak magnetic field,
the starlight from a newly formed cluster will push back the gas and compress
the gas, magnetic field, and cosmic rays until magnetic pressure becomes an
important factor.

have shown. Still, an open question is whether a clear relationship between the
quantitative properties of landscapes and the dominant geomorphologic processes

geometry of topographic isolines is an appropriate observable to help
disentangle such a relationship. A fractal analysis of terrestrial isolines
yields a clear identification of trenches and abyssal plains, differentiates
oceanic ridges from continental slopes and platforms, localizes coastlines and
river systems, and isolates areas at high elevation (or latitude) subjected to
the erosive action of ice. The study of the geometrical properties of the lunar
landscape supports the existence of a correspondence between principal

Lyman-alpha photons before the Epoch of Reionization, the Lyman-alpha
scattering rate responsible for the Wouthuysen-Field effect from an isolated
source will be negligible unless (1) there is sufficient time for the
scattering photons to establish a steady state, or (2) the scattering gas is
undergoing internal expansion or has a peculiar motion of tens to hundreds of
km/s away from the source. We present steady-state solutions in the radiative
diffusion approximation for the radiation field trapped in a clump of gas and
show that this may result in an enhancement, by a factor of up to 10^6, of the
strength of the Wouthuysen-Field effect over that obtained from the
free-streaming limit. Solutions to the time-dependent diffusion equation,
however, suggest that the timescales required to reach such a steady state will
generally exceed the source lifetimes. In the presence of internal expansion, a
steady state may be established as photons are redshifted into the red wing,
and significant enhancement in the scattering rate may again be produced.
Alternatively, a substantial scattering rate may arise in systems with a
peculiar motion away from the source that redshifts the received radiation into
the resonance line centre. As a consequence, at epochs z<30, when collisional
decoupling is small except in dense regions, and prior to the establishment of
any large-scale diffuse radiation field of resonance line photons, the 21cm
signature from the Intergalactic Medium produced by the Wouthuysen-Field effect
will in general trace the peculiar velocity field of the gas in addition to its
density structure.

on the basis of an expanded SN Ia sample, yielded E(B-V)_host=0.09+/-0.03 mag
for SN2005cf. The UV photometry was obtained with the HST and the Swift
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, and the results match each other to within
0.1-0.2 mag. The UV light curves show similar evolution to the broadband U,
with an exception in the 2000-2500 Angstrom spectral range (corresponding to
the F220W/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainter
than that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).
Combining the UV data with the ground-based optical and NIR data, we establish
the generic UV-optical-NIR bolometric light curve for SN 2005cf and derive the
bolometric corrections in the absence of UV and/or NIR data. The overall
spectral evolution of SN 2005cf is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but with
variety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. The spectra at
early times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (HV) features in the Ca II
H&K doublet and NIR triplet. Similar HV features may exist in the SiII 6355
absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in the
earliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be common
in other normal SNe Ia. The possible origin of the HV absorption features is
briefly discussed (abridged).

7619 and NGC 7626, the two dominant members of the Pegasus group. The X-ray
images show a brightness edge associated with each galaxy, which we identify as
merger cold fronts. The edges are sharp, and the axes of symmetry of the edges
are roughly anti-parallel, suggesting that these galaxies are falling towards
one another in the plane of the sky. The detection of merger cold fronts
implies a merging subgroup scenario, since the alternative is that the galaxies
are falling into a pre-existing $\sim1$ keV halo without a dominant galaxy of
its own, and such objects are not observed. We estimate the 3D velocities from
the cold fronts and show that the velocity vectors are indeed most likely close
to the plane of the sky, with a relative velocity of $\sim1190\kms$. The
relative velocity is consistent with what is expected from the infall of two
roughly equal mass subgroups whose total viral mass equals that of the Pegasus
group. We conclude that the Pegasus cluster is currently forming from a major
merger of two subgroups, dominated by NGC 7619 and NGC 7626. NGC 7626 contains
a strong radio source, a core with two symmetric jets and radio lobes. Although
we find no associated structure in the X-ray surface brightness map, the
temperature map reveals a clump of cool gas just outside the southern lobe,
presumably entrained by the lobe, and an extension of cooler gas into the lobe
itself. The jet axis is parallel with the projected direction of motion of NGC
7626 (inferred from the symmetry axis of the merger cold front), and the
southern leading jet is foreshortened as compared to the northern trailing one,
possibly due to the additional ram pressure the forward jet encounters.

discrepant black hole masses if single M_BH-M_Bulge and M_BH-sigma relations

located within 1.5 degrees from the ecliptic plane and include a region within

These range from 2.37 up to 20.2 hours with a median value of 3.7 hours. 11 of

quasi-Fermi levels by 0.1 meV will produce the effect of an external magnetic
field as large as 1 T as long as the alternative relaxation paths for Mn spins

classic Overhauser effect, also called the dynamic nuclear polarization, with
the Mn impurities playing the role of the nucleus. We propose that a lateral
spin-valve structure in anti-parallel configuration with a DMS as the channel
can be used to demonstrate this effect as quasi-Fermi level splitting of such

origin for the GRB emission, synchrotron producing the optical counterpart
emission. In this model, the second upscattering of the burst photons yields a
prompt GeV-TeV emission, whose brightness depends strongly on an unknown
quantity, the peak energy of the primary synchrotron spectrum. Measurements of
the optical, gamma-ray, and GeV prompt fluxes can be used to test the
synchrotron self-Compton model for GRBs and to determine directly the total
radiative output of GRBs. For a set of 29 GRBs with optical counterpart
detections, we find that the expected GeV photon flux should correlate with the
fluence of the sub-MeV emission and should anticorrelate with the brightness of
the optical counterpart, the strength of these correlations decreasing for an
increasing width of the synchrotron peak energy distribution. The detection of
a GeV prompt emission consistent with the extrapolation of the burst spectrum

interconnect regions of opposing photospheric flux -- its connectivity.
Connectivity can be quantified as the net flux connecting pairs of opposing
regions, once such regions are identified. One existing algorithm will
partition a typical active region into a number of unipolar regions ranging
from a few dozen to a few hundred, depending on algorithmic parameters. This
work explores how the properties of the partitions depend on some algorithmic
parameters, and how connectivity depends on the coarseness of partitioning for
one particular active region magnetogram. We find the number of connections
among them scales with the number of regions even as the number of possible
connections scales with its square.
  There are several methods of generating a coronal field, even a potential
field. The field may be computed inside conducting boundaries or over an
infinite half-space. For computation of connectivity, the unipolar regions may
be replaced by point sources or the exact magnetogram may be used as a lower
boundary condition. Our investigation shows that the connectivities from these
various fields differ only slightly -- no more than 15%. The greatest
difference is between fields within conducting walls and those in the
half-space. Their connectivities grow more different as finer partitioning
creates more source regions. This also gives a quantitative means of
establishing how far away conducting boundaries must be placed in order not to
significantly affect the extrapolation. For identical outer boundaries, the use
of point sources instead of the exact magnetogram makes a smaller difference in
connectivity: typically 6% independent of the number of source regions.

Spin resonance induced by high frequency electric fields, known as electric

mediated by spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the spin degree of
freedom and the momentum vector. Here, we report the observation of a novel
spin resonance due to SOI that does not require external driving fields.
Ballistic spin resonance (BSR) is driven by an internal spin-orbit field that
acts upon electrons bouncing at gigaHertz frequencies in narrow channels of
ultra-clean two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). BSR is manifested in
electrical measurements of pure spin currents as a strong suppression of spin
relaxation length when the motion of electrons is in resonance with spin
precession. These findings point the way to gate-tunable coherent spin

optical. Indeed, the majority of LINERs show mid-IR [NeV]14/[NeV]24um flux
ratios well below the theoretical low-density limit, suggesting that there is
substantial extinction toward even the [NeV]-emitting region . Combining
optical, X-ray, and mid-IR diagnostics, we find an AGN detection rate in LINERs

hosting AGN. The [NeV]24um /[OIV]26um mid-IR line flux ratio in ""AGN-LINERs"" is
similar to that of standard AGN, suggesting that the spectral energy

This result is in contrast to previous suggestions of a UV deficit in the
intrinsic broadband continuum emission in AGN-LINERs. Consistent with our

Experimental data of the $H_{\rm c2}(T)$ are successfully analyzed by applying
the Gurevich theory of dirty two-band superconductivity in the case of
$D_{\pi}/D_{\sigma}>1$, where $D_{\pi}$ and $D_{\sigma}$ are the intraband
electron diffusivities for $\pi$ and $\sigma$ bands, respectively. We find that
the parameters obtained from the analysis are strongly correlated to the
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of the films. We also
discuss the anormalous narrowing of the transition width at intermediate
temperatures confirmed by the magnetoresistance measurements.

hydrodynamical models of gas accretion by planetary cores. In some cases, the
accretion flow is resolved down to the surface of the solid core -- the first
time such simulations have been performed. We investigate the dependence of the
gas accretion rate upon the planetary core mass, and the surface density and
opacity of the encompassing protoplanetary disc. Accretion of planetesimals is
neglected.
  We find that high-mass protoplanets are surrounded by thick circumplanetary
discs during their gas accretion phase but, contrary to locally-isothermal
calculations, discs do not form around accreting protoplanets with masses ~<
50M_Earth when radiation hydrodynamical simulations are performed, even if the
grain opacity is reduced from interstellar values by a factor of 100. We find
that the opacity of the gas plays a large role in determining the accretion
rates for low-mass planetary cores. For example, reducing the opacities from
interstellar values by a factor of 100 leads to roughly an order of magnitude
increase in the accretion rates for 10-20M_Earth protoplanets. The dependence
on opacity becomes less important in determining the accretion rate for more
massive cores where gravity dominates the effects of thermal support and the
protoplanet is essentially accreting at the runaway rate. Finally, for low-mass
planetary cores (~< 20M_Earth), we obtain accretion rates that are in agreement
with previous one-dimensional quasi-static models. This indicates that
three-dimensional hydrodynamical effects may not significantly alter the gas
accretion timescales that have been obtained from quasi-static models.

So far many statistical methods have been used for collocation extraction.
Almost all the methods form a classical crisp set of collocation. We propose a
fuzzy logic approach of collocation extraction to form a fuzzy set of
collocations in which each word combination has a certain grade of membership
for being collocation. Fuzzy logic provides an easy way to express natural
language into fuzzy logic rules. Two existing methods; Mutual information and
t-test have been utilized for the input of the fuzzy inference system. The
resulting membership function could be easily seen and demonstrated. To show
the utility of the fuzzy logic some word pairs have been examined as an
example. The working data has been based on a corpus of about one million words
contained in different novels constituting project Gutenberg available on

methods, while overcoming their drawbacks. Hence it provides a better result
than the two methods.

a novel nonlinear transformation, which allows us to reduce the nonlinear

Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the parameter $\alpha $ in six dimensions. Although
the spacetime with base space $S^{2}\times S^{2}$ has curvature singularity at
$r=N$, which does not admit NUT solutions, we may proceed with the same
computations as in the $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ case. The investigation of
thermodynamics of NUT/Bolt solutions in six dimensions is carried out. We
compute the finite action, mass, entropy, and temperature of the black hole.
Then the validity of the first law of thermodynamics is demonstrated. It is
shown that in NUT solutions all thermodynamic quantities for both base spaces
are related to each other by substituting
$\alpha^{\mathbb{CP}^{k}}=[(k+1)/k]\alpha^{S^{2} \times S^{2}\times
>...S_{k}^{2}}$. So no further information is given by investigating NUT
solution in the $S^{2}\times S^{2}$ case. This relation is not true for bolt
solutions. A generalization of the thermodynamics of black holes to arbitrary
even dimensions is made using a new method based on the Gibbs-Duhem relation
and Gibbs free energy for NUT solutions. According to this method, the finite
action in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet is obtained by considering the generalized
finite action in Einstein gravity with an additional term as a function of
$\alpha$. Stability analysis is done by investigating the heat capacity and
entropy in the allowed range of $\alpha$, $\Lambda$ and $N$. For NUT solutions
in $d$ dimensions, there exist a stable phase at a narrow range of $\alpha$. In
six-dimensional Bolt solutions, metric is completely stable for
$\mathcal{B}=S^{2}\times S^{2}$, and is completely unstable for
$\mathcal{B}=\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ case.

Larkin length and the disorder correlation length. Repulsing bosons confined in
a large box with average density $n$ well below a critical value $n_c$ are
trapped in deep potential wells of extension much smaller than distance between
them. Tunneling between these wells is exponentially small. The ground state of
such a gas is a random singlet with no long-range phase correlation For $n>n_c$
repulsion between particles overcomes the disorder and the gas transits from
the localized to a coherent superfluid state. The critical density $n_c$ is
calculated in terms of the disorder parameters and the interaction strength.
For atoms in traps four different regimes are found, only one of it is
superfluid. The theory is extended to lower (1 and 2) dimensions. Its
quantitative predictions can be checked in experiments with ultracold atomic
