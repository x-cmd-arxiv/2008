constitutes an unavoidable first step. In this work, we present an study of
several potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2.
The PESs are calculated using the B3LYP density-functional theory (DFT) method,
with Dunning's basis sets cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, and
cc-pVQZ. These calculations, whose cost amounts to approximately 10 years of

for this model peptide. Also, we compare the B3LYP PESs to a previous
computation at the MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level, in order to assess their
accuracy with respect to a higher level reference. All data sets have been
analyzed according to a general framework which can be extended to other

transitions in the early universe break axial symmetries as originally shown by
Kibble. They are the result of frustrated order in the quantum fields

decades, motivation for their study was provided by the possibility that they
could be behind the density inhomogeneities that led to the observed
large-scale structures in the universe. Precision observations, particularly of
the cosmic microwave background radiation, have limited strings to a
sub-dominant role in structure formation.
  More recently, interest has been revived with the realization that there may
be strong links between field theory cosmic strings and fundamental strings.
The latter are the supposed ultimate building blocks of matter, and in their
original context of superstring theory were thought to be microscopic. However,
in its modern version---sometimes referred to as M-theory---it is possible and
perhaps even mandatory to have macroscopic (cosmological-sized) fundamental

related genes. We found many location-sensitive functional binding events and
showed that they clustered close to the TSS. Our method and findings were put
to several experimental tests. By allowing a ""flexible"" threshold and combining
our functional class and location specific search method with conservation
between human and mouse, we are able to identify reliably functional TF binding
sites. This is an essential step towards constructing regulatory networks and
elucidating the design principles that govern transcriptional regulation of
expression. The promoter region proximal to the TSS appears to be of central
importance for regulation of transcription in human and mouse, just as it is in
bacteria and yeast.

multivalent counterions, specifically Mg$^{+2}$ counterions, is studied.
Experimentally, it is known that MgSO$_4$ salt has a strong and non-monotonic
effect on the amount of DNA ejected. There exists an optimal concentration at
which the minimum amount of DNA is ejected from the virus. At lower or higher
concentrations, more DNA is ejected from the capsid. We propose that this
phenomenon is the result of DNA overcharging by Mg$^{+2}$ multivalent
counterions. As Mg$^{+2}$ concentration increases from zero, the net charge of
DNA changes from negative to positive. The optimal inhibition corresponds to
the Mg$^{+2}$ concentration where DNA is neutral. At lower/higher
concentrations, DNA genome is charged. It prefers to be in solution to lower
its electrostatic self-energy, which consequently leads to an increase in DNA
ejection. By fitting our theory to available experimental data, the strength of
DNA$-$DNA short range attraction energies, mediated by Mg$^{+2}$, is found to
be $-$0.004 $k_BT$ per nucleotide base. This and other fitted parameters agree
well with known values from other experiments and computer simulations. The
parameters are also in aggreement qualitatively with values for tri- and

can support scalable thread synchronization for large-scale many-core
architectures. The universal synchronization primitives that have been deployed
widely in conventional architectures like CAS and LL/SC are expected to reach
their scalability limits in the evolution to many-core architectures with
thousands of cores. We introduce a non-blocking full/empty bit primitive, or
NB-FEB for short, as a promising synchronization primitive for parallel
programming on may-core architectures. We show that the NB-FEB primitive is
universal, scalable, feasible and convenient to use. NB-FEB, together with
registers, can solve the consensus problem for an arbitrary number of processes
(universality). NB-FEB is combinable, namely its memory requests to the same
memory location can be combined into only one memory request, which
consequently mitigates performance degradation due to synchronization ""hot
spots"" (scalability). Since NB-FEB is a variant of the original full/empty bit
that always returns a value instead of waiting for a conditional flag, it is as
feasible as the original full/empty bit, which has been implemented in many
computer systems (feasibility). The original full/empty bit is well-known as a
special-purpose primitive for fast producer-consumer synchronization and has
been used extensively in the specific domain of applications. In this paper, we
show that NB-FEB can be deployed easily as a general-purpose primitive. Using
NB-FEB, we construct a non-blocking software transactional memory system called
NBFEB-STM, which can be used to handle concurrent threads conveniently.
NBFEB-STM is space efficient: the space complexity of each object updated by
$N$ concurrent threads/transactions is $\Theta(N)$, the optimal.

large-scale modulations in the star formation (SF) activity in galaxies. In
order to do this we carefully define local and global estimators of the density
around galaxies. The former are computed using a voronoi tessellation technique
and the latter are parameterised by the normalised distance to haloes and
voids, in terms of the virial and void radii, respectively. As a function of
local density, galaxies show a strong modulation in their SF, a result that is
in agreement with those from several authors. When taking subsamples of equal
local density at different large-scale environments, we find relevant global
effects whereby the fraction of red galaxies diminishes for galaxies in equal
local density environments farther away from clusters and closer to voids. In
general, the semianalytic simulation is in good agreement with the available
observational results, and offers the possibility to disentangle many of the
processes responsible for the variation of galaxy properties with the
environment; we find that the changes found in samples of galaxies with equal
local environment but different distances to haloes or voids come from the
variations in the underlying mass function of dark-matter haloes. There is an
additional possible effect coming from the host dark-matter halo ages,
indicating that halo assembly also plays a small but significant role

at a possible spatial correlation in halo/stellar mass ages.

constant scalar curvature K\""ahler (cscK) metric. A natural question is whether
or not the other obstructions are linearly dependent on the obstruction to the
existence of a cscK metric. The purpose of this paper is to see that this is
not the case by exhibiting toric Fano threefolds in which these obstructions
span at least two dimension. To see this we show that on toric Fano manifolds
these obstructions are obtained as derivatives of the Hilbert series. This last
observation should be regarded as an extension of the volume minimization of
Martelli, Sparks and Yau.

allow users to annotate resources, e.g., Web pages or scientific papers, with
descriptive labels called tags. The social annotations contributed by thousands
of users, can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify
documents or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference
methods do not make best use of social annotation, since they do not take into
account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a
previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes interests
of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of
annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming:
the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this
drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way
to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the
number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the
data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world
data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic
extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics
of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to
discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results
demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social
knowledge contained in user-generated annotations.

dynamics can be effectively used to learn the network topology, i.e., identify
the time evolution of the couplings between the network nodes. To this aim, we
present an adaptive strategy that, based on a potential that the network
systems seek to minimize in order to maintain synchronization, can be
successfully applied to identify the time evolution of the network from limited
information. This strategy takes advantage of the properties of synchronism of
chaos and of the presence of different communication delays over the network
links. As a motivating example we consider a network of sensors surveying an
area, in which information regarding the time evolution of the network
connections can be used, e.g., to detect changes taking place within the area.
We propose two different setups for our strategy. In the first one,
synchronization has to be achieved at each node (as well as the identification
of the couplings over the network links), based solely on a single scalar
signal representing a superposition of signals from the other nodes in the
network. In the second one, we incorporate an additional node, termed the
maestro, having the function of maintaining network synchronization. We will
see that when such an arrangement is realized, it will become possible to
effectively identify the time evolution of networks that are much larger than
would be possible in the absence of a maestro.

function space $\mathcal U(R^k)$ which can be naturally interpreted as the
Fourier transform of the space of Sato's hyperfunctions on $R^k$. It was shown
that all Gelfand--Shilov spaces $S^{\prime 0}_\alpha(R^k)$ ($\alpha>1$) of
analytic functionals are canonically embedded in $\mathcal U(R^k)$. While the
usual definition of support of a generalized function is inapplicable to
elements of $S^{\prime 0}_\alpha(R^k)$ and $\mathcal U(R^k)$, their
localization properties can be consistently described using the concept of {\it
carrier cone} introduced by Soloviev [Lett. Math. Phys. 33 (1995) 49-59; Comm.
Math. Phys. 184 (1997) 579-596]. In this paper, the relation between carrier
cones of elements of $S^{\prime 0}_\alpha(R^k)$ and $\mathcal U(R^k)$ is
studied. It is proved that an analytic functional $u\in S^{\prime
0}_\alpha(R^k)$ is carried by a cone $K\subset R^k$ if and only if its
canonical image in $\mathcal U(R^k)$ is carried by $K$.

  Optical Cavity Using Degenerate Optical Modes","12 pages, 9 figures, ICAP proceeding",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optomechanical devices in which a flexible SiN membrane is placed inside an
optical cavity allow for very high finesse and mechanical quality factor in a
single device. They also provide fundamentally new functionality: the cavity
detuning can be a quadratic function of membrane position. This enables a
measurement of ""position squared"" ($x^2$) and in principle a QND phonon number
readout of the membrane. However, the readout achieved using a single
transverse cavity mode is not sensitive enough to observe quantum jumps between
phonon Fock states.
  Here we demonstrate an $x^2$-sensitivity that is orders of magnitude stronger
using two transverse cavity modes that are nearly degenerate. We derive a
first-order perturbation theory to describe the interactions between
nearly-degenerate cavity modes and achieve good agreement with our measurements
using realistic parameters. We also demonstrate theoretically that the
$x^2$-coupling should be easily tunable over a wide range.

transitions of ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet electron Cooper
pairing. The theory is based on extended Ginzburg-Landau expansion in powers of
superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. We propose a simple form
for the dependence of theory parameters on the pressure that allows correct
theoretical outline of the temperature-pressure phase diagram for which at low
temperatures a stable phase of coexistence of p-wave superconductivity and
itinerant ferromagnetism appears. We demonstrate that the theory is in an
agreement with the experimental data for some intermetallic compounds that are
experimentally proven to be itinerant ferromagnetic exhibiting spin-triplet
superconductivity. Some basic features of quantum phase transitions in such
systems are explained and clarified. We propose to group the spin-triplet
ferromagnetic superconductors in two different types of thermodynamic behavior,
on the basis of quantitative criterion deduced from the present theory and the
analysis of experimental data.

inertial waves can be effectively utilized in isotropic turbulence at small
Reynolds numbers (when the nonlocal interactions are the dominating ones). This
mechanism totally suppresses the local interactions (cascades) in isotropic
turbulence at the Taylor-scale based Reynolds number $R_{\lambda} < 10^2$. This
value of $R_{\lambda}$ (that can be considered as a bifurcation value at which
the local regime emerges from the nonlocal one in isotropic turbulence) is in
agreement with recent direct numerical simulations data. Applicability of this
approach to channel flows is also briefly discussed. A theory of multimode
bifurcations has been developed in order to explain anomalous (in comparison
with the Landau-Hopf bifurcations) properties of the nonlocal-local bifurcation
in isotropic turbulence.
