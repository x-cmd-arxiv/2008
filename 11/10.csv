predictions for dark matter halos and investigate how common merger-related
observables for galaxies--such as close pair counts, starburst counts, and the
morphologically disturbed fraction--likely scale with luminosity, stellar mass,
merger mass ratio, and redshift from z=0 to z=4. We provide a simple
'universal' fitting formula that describes our derived merger rates for dark
matter halos a function of dark halo mass, merger mass ratio, and redshift, and
go on to predict galaxy merger rates using number density-matching to associate
halos with galaxies. For example, we find that the instantaneous merger rate of
m/M>0.3 mass ratio events into typical L > f L* galaxies follows the simple
relation dN/dt=0.03(1+f)(1+z)^2.1 Gyr^-1. Despite the rapid increase in merger
rate with redshift, only a small fraction of >0.4 L* high-redshift galaxies
(~3% at z=2) should have experienced a major merger (m/M >0.3) in the very
recent past (t< 100 Myr). This suggests that short-lived, merger-induced bursts
of star formation should not contribute significantly to the global star
formation rate at early times, in agreement with observational indications. We
emphasize that great care must be made in comparisons to observations because
the predicted observables depend very sensitively on galaxy luminosity,
redshift, overall mass ratio, and uncertain relaxation timescales for merger
remnants. We show that the majority of bright galaxies at z=3 should have
undergone a major merger (>0.3) in the last 700 Myr and conclude that mergers
almost certainly play an important role in delivering baryons and influencing
the kinematic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). (abridged)

correspondence $\kappa$ of \cite{FLTZ} equates $\Perf_T(X_\Sigma)$ with a
subcategory $Sh_{cc}(M_\bR;\LS)$ of constructible sheaves on a vector space

yields an equivariant version of homological mirror symmetry,
$DCoh_T(X_\Si)\cong DFuk(T^*M_\bR;\LS)$, which is an equivalence of
triangulated tensor categories.
  The nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence $\bar{\kappa}$ of
\cite{T} embeds $\Perf(X_\Si)$ into a subcategory
$Sh_c(T_\bR^\vee;\bar{\Lambda}_\Si)$ of constructible sheaves on a compact
torus $T_\bR^\vee$. When $X_\Si$ is nonsingular, the composition of
$\bar{\kappa}$ and microlocalization yields a version of homological mirror

which is a full embedding of triangulated tensor categories.
  When $X_\Si$ is nonsingular and projective, the composition $\tau=\mu\circ
\kappa$ is compatible with T-duality, in the following sense. An equivariant
ample line bundle $\cL$ has a hermitian metric invariant under the real torus,
whose connection defines a family of flat line bundles over the real torus
orbits. This data produces a T-dual Lagrangian brane $\mathbb L$ on the
universal cover $T^*M_\bR$ of the dual real torus fibration. We prove $\mathbb
L\cong \tau(\cL)$ in $Fuk(T^*M_\bR;\LS).$ Thus, equivariant homological mirror

Micromagnetic models predict that the switching is mediated by a

deformation. In the same theoretical framework, a critical core velocity is
predicted, above which switching occurs. Although these models are extensively
studied and generally accepted, experimental support has been lacking until

multi-qubit quantum system under a prescribed sequence of unitary
transformations. The input to the algorithm prescribes some of the unitary
transformations in the sequence with others remaining fixed. For oracle query
algorithms, the input determines the oracle unitary transformation. Such
algorithms can be regarded as devices for discriminating amongst a set of
unitary transformations. The question arises: ""Given a set of known oracle
unitary transformations, to what extent is it possible to discriminate amongst
them?"" We investigate this for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. The task of
discriminating amongst the admissible oracle unitary transformations results in
an exhaustive collection of algorithms which can solve the problem with
certainty.

with an isolated critical value at 0 ($K$ an algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero) we construct a closed {\it bundle} $G_F \subset T^{*}K^n
$. We restrict $ G_F $ over the critical points $Sing(F)$ of $ F$ in $
F^{-1}(0)$ and partition $Sing(F)$ into {\it 'quasistrata'} of points with the
fibers of $G_F$ of constant dimension. It turns out that T-W-a (Thom and
Whitney-a) stratifications 'near' $F^{-1}(0)$ exist iff the fibers of bundle
$G_F$ are orthogonal to the tangent spaces at the smooth points of the
quasistrata (e. g. when $ l=1$). Also, the latter are the orthogonal
complements over an irreducible component $ S $ of a quasistratum only if $S $
is {\bf universal} for the class of {T-W-a} stratifications, meaning that for
any $\{S_j'\}_j $ in the class, $ \Sing (F) = \cup_j S'_j $, there is a
component $S' $ of an $ S_j' $ with $S\cap S'$ being open and dense in both $S

  {\bf Results.} We prove that T-W-a stratifications with only universal strata
exist iff all fibers of $G_F$ are the orthogonal complements to the respective
tangent spaces to the quasistrata, and then the partition of $\Sing(F)$ by the
latter yields the coarsest {\it universal T-W-a stratification}.

nonsingular points nearby are 'uniformly noncritical' (e. g. for a dominating
map $ F: X \to Z $ meaning that the sum of the absolute values of the $l\times

does not vanish but, moreover, is separated from zero by a positive constant).

micron, but the emission is usually dominated by heating from an AGN or from
the evolved stellar population. Here we present Spitzer MIPS observations of a
sample of elliptical and lenticular galaxies that are rich in cold molecular
gas, and we investigate whether the MIR to FIR emission could be associated
with star formation activity. The 24 micron images show a rich variety of
structures, including nuclear point sources, rings, disks, and smooth extended
emission. Comparisons to matched-resolution CO and radio continuum images
suggest that the bulk of the 24 micron emission can be traced to star formation
with some notable exceptions. The 24 micron luminosities of the CO-rich
galaxies are typically a factor of 15 larger than what would be expected from
the dust associated with their evolved stars. In addition, FIR/radio flux
density ratios are consistent with star formation. We conclude that the star
formation rates in z=0 elliptical and lenticular galaxies, as inferred by other
authors from UV and optical data, are roughly consistent with the molecular gas
abundances and that the molecular gas is usually unstable to star formation
activity.

yet to be understood. We reconsider the possibility that the excess of very
strong MgII absorbers toward GRBs is intrinsic either to the GRBs themselves or
to their immediate environment, and associated with bulk outflows with
velocities as large as v_{max} ~ 0.3c. In order to examine this hypothesis, we
accumulate a sample of 27 W_r(2796) > 1 A absorption systems found toward 81
quasars, and compare their properties to those of 9 W_r(2796)>1 A absorption
systems found toward 6 GRBs; all systems have been observed at high spectral
resolution (R = 45,000) using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph
on the Very Large Telescope. We make multiple comparisons of the absorber
properties across the two populations, testing for differences in metallicity,
ionization state, abundance patterns, dust abundance, kinematics, and phase
structure. We find no significant differences between the two absorber
populations using any of these metrics, implying that, if the excess absorbers
toward GRB lines of sight are indeed intrinsic, they must be produced in a
process which has strong similarities to the processes yielding strong MgII
systems in association with intervening galaxies. Although this may seem a
priori unlikely, given the high outflow velocities required for any intrinsic
model, we note that the same conclusion was reached, recently, with respect to
the narrow absorption line systems seen in some quasars.

neutron diffraction studies carried out at room temperature, affects magnetic

features in the 8-micron IRAC band. This fraction is significantly larger than
the 5% of red galaxies with f24<0.3 mJy that are estimated to have strong PAH
emission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due to
star-formation processes. Only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies have
optical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classified

infrared results suggest that both AGN and star-formation activity is occurring
simultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. These results
should serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical line
diagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared and
other bands. We find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-on
spiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. The remaining sources are likely
to be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination of
obscured AGN and star-formation activity.

photodetectors in recent years. One of the issues with the PPD is its high
noise rate. As well as random noise, PPD also exhibits so called after-pulsing
and optical crosstalk, and these limit the applicable range of its gain as well
as its size. By accurately measuring each of these causes of noises
independently, we quantitatively evaluated how the performance of the present

the AKARI IRC Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC survey
observed about a 10 square degree area of the LMC in five bands centered at 3,
7, 11, 15, and 24 \micron using the Infrared Camera (IRC) aboard AKARI. The
number of SNRs in the survey area is 21, which is about a half of the known LMC
SNRs. We systematically examined the AKARI images and identified eight SNRs
with distinguishable infrared emission. All of them were detected at $\gtrsim
10$ \micron and some at 3 and 7 \micron, too. We present their AKARI images and
fluxes. In the 11/15 \micron versus 15/24 \micron color-color diagram, the SNRs
appear to be aligned along a modified blackbody curve, representing thermal
emission from dust at temperatures between 90 and 190 K. There is a good
correlation between the 24 \micron and X-ray fluxes of the SNRs. It was also
found that there is a good correlation between the 24 \micron and radio fluxes
even if there is no direct physical connection between them. We considered the
origin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual SNRs. We conclude
that the mid-infrared emissions in five SNRs that show morphologies similar to
the X-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by X-ray
emitting plasma. Their 15/24 \micron color temperatures are generally higher
than the Spitzer 24/70 \micron color temperatures, which suggests that a
single-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the SNRs. It also implies that our understanding of the
full SED is essential for estimating the dust destruction rate of grains by SNR
shocks.

to be in a state of turbulence. This is an excellent explanation of the physics
of self-sustenance of wall turbulence. The mechanism of receptivity for

is carried out using the projection and level set methods. The motion of fibres
is described using the Jeffery equation and the contribution of fibres to the
flow is accounted for by the configuration field method. The governing
Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid flow is solved using the projection method
with finite difference scheme, while the fibre-related equations are directly
solved with the Runge-Kutta method. Our findings indicate that the fibre motion
has strong influence on the distributions of the streamwise and transverse
velocities in the fountain flow. Fibre motion produces strong normal stress
near the wall which leads to the reduction of transversal velocity as compared
to the Newtonian flow without fibres and in turn the streamwise velocity near
the wall is increased. Thus, the fibre addition to the flow weakens the
strength of the fountain flow. It is also found that the fibre orientation is
not always along the direction of velocity vector in the process of mold
filling. In the region of the fountain flow, the fibre near the centerline is
more oriented cross the streamwise direction comparing to that in the region
far behind the flow front. This leads to that the fibre near the centreline in
the region of fountain flow is more extended along the transverse direction.
Since fibre orientation in the suspension flow and the shape of the flow front
have great bearing on the quality of the product made from injection molding,
this study has much implications for engineering applications. These results
can also be useful in other field dealing with fibre suspensions.

Configuration Field (BFC) method to simulate the fibre suspension flow in

stress at high concentration, the Discrete Adaptive Viscoelastic Stress
Splitting (DAVSS) method is employed. For the axisymmetric contraction and
expansion passages with different geometry ratios, the results obtained are
compared to available constitutive models and experiments. The predicted vortex
length for dilute suspensions agrees well with experimental data in literature.
Our numerical results show clearly the effect on vortex enhancement with
increase of the volume fractions and the aspect ratios. Effect of aspect ratio
of fibres on the vortex length is also studied. It is found that for the lower
expansion ratio flows the vortex dimension in the corner region is fairly
independent of fibre concentration and aspect ratio of fibres while the said
vortex dimension increases with the increase of fibre concentration for
contraction flows. The finding suggests that the aligned fibre approximation
traditionally employed in previous work does not exactly describe the effect of
fibre motion, and the present BFC method is deemed more suitable for the flow
of dilute fibre suspensions. In terms of numerics, the employment of DAVSS
enhances numerical stability in the presence of high concentration of fibre in
the flow.

oscillation experiments. It is based on a microscopic model for pion production
off the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into
account the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,
the model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads
to coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than
most of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the
main nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the
final pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar
models by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more
sophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the
modification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly
reduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the
peak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not
much affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by
15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are
estimated to be small. Finally, we discuss at length the deficiencies of the
Rein-Sehgal pion coherent production model for neutrino energies below 2 GeV,
and in particular for the MiniBooNE and T2K experiments. We also predict flux
averaged cross sections for these two latter experiments and K2K.

various observables as a function of the disorder strength $W$ and the number
$N$ of generations. We first consider the Landauer transmission $T_N$. In the
localized phase, its logarithm follows the traveling wave form $\ln T_N \simeq
\bar{\ln T_N} + \ln t^*$ where (i) the disorder-averaged value moves linearly
$\bar{\ln (T_N)} \simeq - \frac{N}{\xi_{loc}}$ and the localization length
diverges as $\xi_{loc} \sim (W-W_c)^{-\nu_{loc}}$ with $\nu_{loc}=1$ (ii) the
variable $t^*$ is a fixed random variable with a power-law tail $P^*(t^*) \sim
1/(t^*)^{1+\beta(W)}$ for large $t^*$ with $0<\beta(W) \leq 1/2$, so that all
integer moments of $T_N$ are governed by rare events. In the delocalized phase,
the transmission $T_N$ remains a finite random variable as $N \to \infty$, and
we measure near criticality the essential singularity $\bar{\ln (T)} \sim - |
W_c-W |^{-\kappa_T}$ with $\kappa_T \sim 0.25$. We then consider the
statistical properties of normalized eigenstates, in particular the entropy and
the Inverse Participation Ratios (I.P.R.). In the localized phase, the typical
entropy diverges as $(W-W_c)^{- \nu_S}$ with $\nu_S \sim 1.5$, whereas it grows
linearly in $N$ in the delocalized phase. Finally for the I.P.R., we explain
how closely related variables propagate as traveling waves in the delocalized
phase. In conclusion, both the localized phase and the delocalized phase are
characterized by the traveling wave propagation of some probability
distributions, and the Anderson localization/delocalization transition then
corresponds to a traveling/non-traveling critical point. Moreover, our results
point towards the existence of several exponents $\nu$ at criticality.

up of a geometrically thin and warm central disk, surrounded by a colder,
fluffy torus component. In an exploratory study, we investigate one possible
physical mechanism, which could produce such a structure, namely the effect of
stellar feedback from a young nuclear star cluster on the interstellar medium
in centres of AGN. The model is realised with the help of the hydrodynamics
code TRAMP. We follow the evolution of the interstellar medium by taking
discrete mass loss and energy ejection due to stellar processes, as well as
optically thin radiative cooling into account. In a post-processing step, we
calculate observable quantities (spectral energy distributions and images) with
the help of the radiative transfer code MC3D. The interplay between injection
of mass, supernova explosions and radiative cooling leads to a two-component
structure made up of a cold geometrically thin, but optically thick and very
turbulent disk residing in the vicinity of the angular momentum barrier,
surrounded by a filamentary structure. The latter consists of cold long radial
filaments flowing towards the disk and a hot tenuous medium in between, which
shows both inwards and outwards directed motions. This modelling is able to
reproduce the range of observed neutral hydrogen column densities of a sample
of Seyfert galaxies as well as the relation between them and the strength of
the silicate 10 micron spectral feature. Despite being quite crude, our mean

14.9 Myr, were found to fit better 10 of the 14 observed frequencies, which
were identified as the fundamental radial mode and the three L=1 triplets g, p,
and p. The splittings and aymmetries found for these modes recover those
provided in the literature, except for p. For this last mode, all its

information about the internal rotation profile, in particular in the outer
regions of the star.

rotation yield slightly better results as compared with those given by
uniformly-rotating models. Furthermore, we show that asymmetries are quite
dependent on the overshooting of the convective core, which make the present
technique suitable for testing the theories describing the angular momentum

states. The intended application is the description of nuclear collective
motion where the smoothing of the transition is compulsory to remove
singularities. The stabilized pairing functional allows a thoroughly
variational formulation, unlike the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) scheme which is often
used for the purpose of smoothing. First applications to nuclear ground states
and collective excitations prove the reliability and efficiency of the proposed
stabilized pairing.

1.5-7 keV energy band, performed by exploiting the Swift X-ray telescope (XRT)
data archive. We also present a CXRB spectral model in a wider energy band
(1.5-200 keV), obtained by combining these data with the recently published
Swift-BAT measurement. From the XRT archive we collect a complete sample of 126
high Galactic latitude gamma-ray burst (GRB) follow-up observations. This
provides a total exposure of 7.5 Ms and a sky-coverage of 7 square degrees
which represents a serendipitous survey, well suited for a direct measurement
of the CXRB in the 1.5-10 keV interval. Our work is based on a complete
characterization of the instrumental background and an accurate measurement of
the stray-light contamination and vignetting calibration. We find that the CXRB
spectrum in the 1.5-7 keV energy band can be equally well fitted by a single
power-law with photon index Gamma=1.47+/-0.07 or a single power-law with photon
index Gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and an exponential roll-off at 41 keV. The measured
flux in the 2-10 keV energy band is 2.18+/-0.13 E-11 erg/(cm2 s deg2) in the
2-10 keV band. Combining Swift-XRT with Swift-BAT (15-200 keV) we find that, in
the 1.5-200 keV band, the CXRB spectrum can be well described by two
smoothly-joined power laws with the energy break at 29.0+/-0.5 keV
corresponding to a nu F_nu peak located at 22.4+/-0.4 keV. Taking advantage of
both the Swift high energy instruments (XRT and BAT), we produce an analytical
description of the CXRB spectrum over a wide (1.5-200 keV) energy band. This
model is marginally consistent with the HEAO1 measurement (~10% higher at
energies higher than 20 keV, while it is significantly (30%) higher at low
energies (2-10 keV).

luminosity function in all bands using a Maximum Likelihood fit technique to an
analytical model. We find that the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is best
described by a Luminosity-Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) model. Our results
show a good overall agreement with previous results in the Hard band, although
with slightly weaker evolution. Our model in the Soft band present slight
discrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day XLF
being significantly flatter. We find faster evolution in the AGN detected in
the Ultrahard band than those in the Hard band. The fraction of absorbed AGN in
the Hard and Ultrahard bands is dependent on the X-ray luminosity. We find
evidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the Hard band but not
in the Ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. Our best-fit XLF
shows that the high-luminosity AGN are fully formed earlier than the less
luminous AGN. The latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretion

which could have come from inflation, with only a growing component and no

close to the supposed critical limit, we have modified our previous computer
code with the introduction of an adaptive mesh refinement scheme. This has
allowed us to follow black hole formation from perturbations whose amplitudes
are up to eight orders of magnitude closer to the threshold than we could do
before. We find that scaling-law behaviour continues down to the smallest black
hole masses that we are able to follow and we see no evidence of shock
production such as has been reported in some previous studies and which led
there to a breaking of the scaling-law behaviour at small black-hole masses. We
attribute this difference to the different initial conditions used. In addition
to the scaling law, we also present other features of the results which are
characteristic of critical collapse in this context.

from the GUT scale to the seesaw scale gives rise to breaking of the mu-tau
symmetry and a tiny splitting between two degenerate heavy Majorana neutrino
masses as well as small variations of the CP phases in Y_nu, which are
essential to achieve a successful leptogenesis. Such small RG effects lead to
tiny deviations of theta_{23} from the maximal value and the CP phase
delta_{CP} from pi/2 imposed at the GUT scale due to mu-tau reflection
symmetry. In our scenario, the required amount of the baryon asymmetry eta_B
can be generated via so-called resonant e-leptogenesis, in which the wash-out

successful leptogenesis. We show that CP violation responsible for the

violation measurable through neutrino oscillation as well as neutrino mixing
angles theta_{12} and theta_{13}. We expect that, in addition to the reactor

the so-called Wess-Zumino model (the simplest field theory invariant under
Supersymmetry) are then given. We further introduce an additional algebraic
structure called Lie algebras of order F, which naturally comprise the concepts
of ordinary Lie algebras and superalgebras. This structure enables us to define
various non-trivial extensions of the Poincar\'e algebra. These extensions are
studied more precisely in two different contexts. The first algebra we are
considering is shown to be an (infinite dimensional) higher order extension of
the Poincar\'e algebra in $(1+2)-$dimensions and turns out to induce a symmetry
which connects relativistic anyons. The second extension we are studying is
related to a specific finite dimensional Lie algebra of order three, which is a
cubic extension of the Poincar\'e algebra in $D-$space-time dimensions.

current-carrying outflows exhibit self-collimation and consequent acceleration
near the rotation axis, but unconfined outflows lose causal connectivity across
the jet and therefore do not collimate or accelerate efficiently in their outer
regions. Magnetically accelerated jets confined by an external pressure that
varies with distance with a power-law index < 2 assume a paraboloidal shape and
have an acceleration efficiency > 50%. They attain Lorentz factors > 30 on
scales 10^9-3x10^10 cm, consistent with the possibility that short/hard GRB

relativistic winds from accretion discs, and > 100 on scales 10^10-10^12 cm,
consistent with the possibility that long/soft GRB jets are accelerated within
the envelopes of collapsing massive stars. We also find that the Lorentz factor
of a magnetically accelerated jet is approximately inversely proportional to
the opening half-angle of the poloidal streamlines. This implies that the
gamma-ray emitting components of GRB outflows are very narrow, with a
half-angle < 1 degree in regions where the Lorentz factor exceeds 100, and that
the afterglow light curves of these components would either exhibit a very

abundance than HCO+ in the PDR (~1-2 x10^{-9} with respect to H2). Pure
gas-phase chemistry models fail to reproduce the observed HCO abundance by ~2
orders of magnitude, except if reactions of OI with carbon radicals abundant in
the PDR (i.e., CH2) play a significant role in the HCO formation.
Alternatively, HCO could be produced in the PDR by non-thermal processes such
as photo-processing of ice mantles and subsequent photo-desorption of either
HCO or H2CO, and further gas phase photodissociation. The measured HCO/H13CO+
abundance ratio is large towards the PDR (~50), and much lower toward the gas

by the observed universal $L_{\rm soft} \propto T^{-4}$ relation between
soft--excess luminosity and temperature, and is reasonable on general physical
grounds. The beam scaling means that all observable properties of bright ULXs
depend essentially only on the Eddington ratio $\dot m$, and that these systems
vary mainly because the beaming is sensitive to the Eddington ratio. This
suggests that bright ULXs are stellar--mass systems accreting at Eddington
ratios of order 10 -- 30, with beaming factors $b \ga 0.1$. Lower--luminosity
ULXs follow bolometric (not soft--excess) $L \sim T^4$ correlations and
probably represent {\it sub}--Eddington accretion on to black holes with masses
$\sim 10\msun$. High--mass X-ray binaries containing black holes or neutron
stars and undergoing rapid thermal-- or nuclear--timescale mass transfer are
excellent candidates for explaining both types. If the $b \propto \dot m^{-2}$
scaling for bright ULXs can be extrapolated to the Eddington ratios found in
SS433, some objects currently identified as AGN at modest redshifts might
actually be ULXs (`pseudoblazars'). This may explain cases where the active

phase-field-crystal variable which is determined by solving an evolution
equation derived from the free energy. Simulated periodic arrays of
dimerization variable is consistent with scanning-tunnelling-microscopy images
of the two dimerized surfaces. Calculated temperature dependence of the
dimerization parameter indicates that normal dimers and broken ones coexist
between the temperatures describing the charactristic temperature width of the
phase-transition, $T_L$ and $T_H$, and a first-order phase transition takes
place at a temperature between them. The dimerization over the whole

nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) from the spherical Jeans equations.
Whether the dark halos are cusped or cored at the centre is an important
strategic problem in modern astronomy. The observational data comprise the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of a luminous tracer population. We show that
when such data are analysed to find the dark matter density with the spherical
Poisson and Jeans equations, then the generic solution is a dark halo density
that is cusped like an isothermal. Although milder cusps (like the
Navarro-Frenk-White 1/r cusp and even cores are possible, they are not generic.
Such solutions exist only if the anisotropy parameter beta and the logarithmic
slope of the stellar density gamma satisfy the constraint gamma = 2 x beta at
the centre or if the radial velocity dispersion falls to zero at the centre.
This surprisingly strong statement is really a consequence of the assumption of
spherical symmetry, and the consequent coordinate singularity at the origin.
So, for example, a dSph with an exponential light profile can exist in
Navarro-Frenk- White halo and have a flat velocity dispersion, but anisotropy
in general drives the dark halo solution to an isothermal cusp. The identified
cusp or core is therefore a consequence of the assumptions (particularly of
spherical symmetry and isotropy), and not the data.

acceleration at relativistic shocks, some difficulties recently raised with the
scattering issue, a crucial aspect of the process. Most pioneering works were
developed assuming the scattering off magnetic fluctuations as given. Even in
that case, when a mean field is considered, its orientation is mostly
perpendicular to the shock normal in the front frame, and this tends to quench
the scattering process. Solving this difficulty leads to address the issue of
the generation of very intense magnetic fluctuations at short wave lengths. The
relativistic motion of the shock front let the cosmic rays to visit upstream
during a very short time only, making this generation of magnetic fluctuations
very challenging. Anyway there is some hope to solve the problem. Thanks to a
recent work by Spitkovsky (2008) \cite{AS}, we know that the process works
without any mean field and now we have to investigate up to which intensity the
mean field can be amplified for allowing Fermi process with appropriate fast
instabilities. In this presentation, the collisionless shock structure in
relativistic regime is sketched, the scattering issue is presented, and the
instabilities that can provide the expected magnetic field amplification are
presented as well. Although there exists observational evidence that particles

produced by cosmic gamma rays of energies E>100GeV. The effective area of
Milagro peaks at energies E~10TeV, however it is still large even down to a few
hundred GeV (~10m^2 at 100GeV). The wide field of view (~2sr) and high duty
cycle (>90%) of Milagro make it ideal for continuously monitoring the overhead
sky for transient Very High Energy (VHE) emissions. This study searched the
Milagro data for such emissions. Even though the search was optimized primarily
for detecting the emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it was still sensitive
to the emission from the last stages of the evaporation of Primordial Black
Holes or to any other kind of phenomena that produce bursts of VHE gamma rays.
Measurements of the GRB spectra by satellites up to few tens of GeV showed no
signs of a cutoff. Even though multiple instruments sensitive to $GeV/TeV$
gamma rays have performed observations of GRBs, there has not yet been a
definitive detection of such an emission yet. One of the reasons for that is
that gamma rays with energies E>~100GeV are attenuated by interactions with the
extragalactic background light or are absorbed internally at the site of the
burst. There are many models that predict VHE gamma-ray emission from GRBs. A
detection or a constraint of such an emission can provide useful information on
the mechanism and environment of GRBs. This study performed a blind search of
the Milagro data of the last five years for bursts of VHE gamma rays with
