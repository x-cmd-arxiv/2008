transitions of quantum antiferromagnets in two spatial dimensions. We begin
with the simplest spin liquid state, the Z_2 spin liquid, whose elementary
excitations are spinons and visons, carrying Z_2 electric and magnetic charges
respectively. Their dynamics are expressed in terms of a doubled U(1)
Chern-Simons theory, which correctly captures the `topological' order of the
Z_2 spin liquid state. We show that the same theory also yields a description
of the variety of ordered phases obtained when one or more of the elementary
excitations condense. Field theories for the transitions and multicritical
points between these phases are obtained. We also survey experimental results
on antiferromagnets on the anisotropic triangular lattice, and make connections
between their phase diagrams and our results.

9,000 GCs at V = 27.71 +- 0.07 (M_V = -7.3). Both a simple Gaussian curve and
an evolved Schechter function fit the bright half of the GCLF equally well,
though the Coma GCLF is broader and has a higher ``cutoff mass'' (M_c ~ 3 x
10^6 M_Sun) than in any of the Virgo giants. These five Coma members exhibit a
huge range in GC specific frequency, from a low of S_N = 0.7 for NGC 4881 up to
12 for IC 4051 and NGC 4874. No single formation scenario appears able to
account for these differences in otherwise-similar galaxies. The supergiant NGC
4874 has the richest globular cluster system known, probably holding more than
30,000 clusters; its true extent is not yet determined and may extend well out
into the Coma potential well. For the three biggest GC systems (NGC 4874, 4889,
IC 4051), all three populations are dominated by red, metal-rich clusters.
Their metallicity distributions also may all have the normal bimodal form, with
the two sequences at the expected mean colors <V-I>(blue) = 0.98 and <V-I>(red)
= 1.15. However, the color distributions and relative numbers of metal-rich
clusters show intriguing counterexamples to a trend established by Peng et al.

most massive regimes represented by the Coma supergiants, formation of
metal-rich clusters seems to have been especially favored.

violation in the early Universe. Bodeker has derived an effective theory that
describes the dynamics of the soft field modes by means of a Langevin equation.
This effective theory has been used for lattice calculations so far. In this
work we provide a complementary, more analytic approach based on
Dyson-Schwinger equations. Using methods known from stochastic quantisation, we
recast Bodeker's Langevin equation in the form of a field theoretic path
integral. We introduce gauge ghosts in order to help control possible gauge
artefacts that might appear after truncation, and which leads to a BRST
symmetric formulation and to corresponding Ward identities. A second set of
Ward identities, reflecting the origin of the theory in a stochastic
differential equation, is also obtained. Finally Dyson-Schwinger equations are
derived.

derive a minimum true spatial separation and a lower limit to their orbital

significant hydrogen emission and in most cases no additional He i or He ii

measured to have T_eff around 40,000 K. Furthermore, we identify 70 very

effects may play a role, the fraction 6.4 % of WD-M star binaries with orbital
separations of around 500 AU is a criterion for evolutionary models of stellar
binary systems. Active M dwarfs are likely present in 155 Balmer-emitting

likely due to additional WDs in the DB-DO T_eff range, for which no detailed

of the Solar system. Our work is inspired by work of Malhotra and Minton
(2008). Using the linear Laplace-Lagrange theory, they identified a strong
secular resonance that may excite large eccentricity of orbits in the HZ.
However, due to uncertain or unconstrained orbital parameters, the sub-system
of Jupiters may be found in dynamically active region of the phase space
spanned by low-order mean-motion resonances. To generalize this secular model,
we construct a semi-analytical averaging method in terms of the restricted
problem. The secular orbits of large planets are approximated by numerically
averaged osculating elements. They are used to calculate the mean orbits of
terrestrial planets by means of a high-order analytic secular theory developed
in our previous works. We found regions in the parameter space of the problem
in which stable, quasi-circular orbits in the HZ are permitted. The excitation
of eccentricity in the HZ strongly depends on the apsidal angle of jovian
orbits. For some combinations of that angle, eccentricities and semi-major axes
consistent with the observations, a terrestrial planet may survive in low
eccentric orbits. We also study the effect of post-Newtonian gravity correction
on the innermost secular resonance.

earlier SPH simulations indicated a very quick disruption of the binary on
roughly the orbital time scale, more recent grid-based calculations find
long-lived mass transfer for many orbital periods. Here we demonstrate how
sensitive the dynamics of this last stage is to the exact initial conditions.
We show that, after a careful preparation of the initial conditions, the
reportedly short-lived systems undergo mass transfer for many dozens of orbits.
The reported numbers of orbits are resolution-biased and therefore represent
only lower limits to what is realized in nature. Nevertheless, the study shows
convincingly the convergence of different methods to very similar results.

energy distributions of knots in 3C 273 jet. Based on the hypothesis of the
single index of the particle energy spectrum at injection and identical
emission processes among all the knots, the observed difference of spectral
shape among different 3C273 knots can be understood as a manifestation of
deviation of the equivalent Doppler factor of stratified emission regions in
individual knot from a characteristic one. The summed spectral energy
distribution of all the ten knots in 3C 273 jet can be well fitted by two
components, low-energy (radio to optical) component dominated by the
synchrotron radiation and high-energy component (UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray)
dominated by the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background.
This gives a consistent spectral index of $\alpha=0.88$ ($S_\nu \propto
\nu^{-\alpha}$) and a characteristic Doppler factor of 7.4. Assuming the
average of the summed spectrum as the characteristic spectrum of each knot in
the 3C273 jet, we further get a distribution of Doppler factor. We discuss the
possible implications of these results for the physical properties in 3C 273
jet. Future GeV observations with $\it GLAST$ could separate the $\gamma$-ray
emission of 3C 273 from the large scale jet and the small scale jet (i.e. the

as the density of the peaks. The distribution of the length of the critical

from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph are presented for 25 FLS sources and for

characteristics for the total 10 mJy sample. Sources have 0.01 < z < 2.4 and
41.8 < log vLv(15um) < 46.2 (ergs/s). Average spectra are determined as a
function of luminosity; lower luminosity sources (log vLv(15um) < 44.0) are
dominated by PAH features and higher luminosity sources (log vLv(15um) > 44.0)
are dominated by silicate absorption or emission. We find that a rest frame
equivalent width of 0.4um for the 6.2um PAH emission feature provides a well
defined division between lower luminosity, ""pure"" starbursts and higher
luminosity AGN or composite sources. Using the average spectra, fluxes fv(24um)
which would be observed with the Spitzer MIPS are predicted as a function of
redshift for sources with luminosities that correspond to the average spectra.
AGN identical to those in this 10 mJy sample could be seen to z = 3 with
fv(24um) > 1 mJy, but starbursts fall to fv(24um) < 1 mJy by z ~ 0.5. This
indicates that substantial luminosity evolution of starbursts is required to
explain the numerous starbursts found in other IRS results having fv(24um) > 1

HESS J1825-137 and Vela X are considered to be the prototypes of such sources
in which the large VHE nebula results from the whole history of the pulsar wind
and the supernova remnant host, both evolving in a complex interstellar medium.

J1825-137, a spectral steepening at increasing distance from the pulsar has
been measured. In this context, updated H.E.S.S. results on two previously

with respect to systemic velocity. Optical and near-IR spectroscopic studies
show no evidence for similarly high velocity gas components in forbidden lines
at shorter wavelengths. We interpret this as the result of strong extinction
(Av=10-50) on the high-velocity gas, which identifies the base of the outflow
traced in 5007A [OIII] as a plausible origin. Unusual excitation conditions are
implied by a comparison of the mid-infrared low-excitation neon line emission
and the PAH emission for a sample of 56 ULIRGs. For IRAS F00183, the neon/PAH
ratio is 8 times higher than the average ratio. Similar mid-infrared kinematic
and excitation characteristics are found for only 2 other ULIRGs in our sample:
IRAS 12127-1412NE and IRAS 13451+1232. Both sources have an elevated neon/PAH
ratio and exhibit pronounced blue wings in their 15.56um [NeIII] line profiles.
IRAS 13451 even shows a strongly blue shifted and broad 14.32um [NeV] line.
While for IRAS 13451 the observed [NeIII]/[NeII] and [NeV]/[NeII] line ratios
indicate exposure of the blue shifted gas to direct radiation from the AGN, for
IRAS F00183 and 12127 the neon line ratios are consistent with an origin in
fast shocks in a high-density environment, and with an evolutionary scenario in
which strongly blue shifted [Ne II] and [Ne III] emission trace the (partial)
disruption of the obscuring medium around a buried AGN. The detection of
strongly blue shifted [Ne V] emission in IRAS 13451 would then indicate this

the zero set near a zero $x$ of $f$ with isotropy subgroup $G$. It is known
from results of Bierstone and Field on $G$-transversality theory that the zero
set in a neighborhood of $x$ is a stratified set. The purpose of this paper is
to partially determine the structure of the stratified set near $x$ using only
information from the representations $V$ and $W$. We define an index
$s(\Sigma)$ for isotropy subgroups $\Sigma$ of $G$ which is the difference of
the dimension of the fixed point subspace of $\Sigma$ in $V$ and $W$. Our main
result states that if $V$ contains a subspace $G$-isomorphic to $W$, then for
every maximal isotropy subgroup $\Sigma$ satisfying $s(\Sigma)>s(G)$, the zero
set of $f$ near $x$ contains a smooth manifold of zeros with isotropy subgroup
$\Sigma$ of dimension $s(\Sigma)$. We also present a systematic method to study
the zero sets for group representations $V$ and $W$ which do not satisfy the

several questions concerning the computation of zero sets of equivariant maps.

perturbations in the presence of inverse triad corrections of loop quantum
gravity are derived. Some immediate effects are pointed out, for instance
concerning conservation of power on large scales and non-adiabaticity. It is
also emphasized that several critical corrections can only be seen to arise in
a fully consistent treatment where the gauge freedom of canonical gravity is
not fixed before implementing quantum corrections. In particular, metric modes
must be allowed to be inhomogeneous: it is not consistent to assume only matter
inhomogeneities on a quantum corrected homogeneous background geometry. In this
way, stringent consistency conditions arise for possible quantization

cooling age, from which we derive the each star's progenitor mass. These data
are then added to the empirical initial-final mass relation (IFMR), where the
M35 WDs contribute significantly to the high-mass end of the relation. The
resulting points are consistent with previously-published linear fits to the
IFMR, modulo moderate systematics introduced by the uncertainty in the star
cluster age. Based on this cluster alone, the observational lower limit on the
maximum mass of white dwarf progenitors is found to be ~5.1-5.2 solar masses at
the 95% confidence level; including data from other young open clusters raises
this limit as high as 7.1 solar masses, depending on the cluster membership of
three massive WDs and the core-composition of the most massive WDs. We find
that the apparent distance modulus and extinction derived solely from the
cluster white dwarfs [(m-M)v=10.45 +/- 0.08 and E(B-V)=0.185 +/- 0.010,
respectively] is fully consistent with that derived from main-sequence fitting
techniques. Four M35 WDs may be massive enough to have oxygen-neon cores; the

the evolutionary tracks on the rest-frame luminosity-peak energy Liso-Ep'
diagram. We are interested in exploring the extension of the `Yonetoku'
correlation to any phase of the prompt light curve, and in verifying how the
high-signal prompt duration time, Tf, in the rest frame correlates with the
residuals of such correlation (Firmani et al. 2006). For our purpose, we
analyse separately two samples of time-resolved spectra corresponding to 32
GRBs with peak fluxes >1.8 phot cm^-2 s^-1 from the Swift-BAT detector, and 7
bright GRBs from the CGRO-BATSE detector previously processed by Kaneko et al.
(2006). After constructing the Liso-Ep' diagram, we discuss the relevance of
selection effects, finding that they could affect significantly the
correlation. However, we find that these effects are much less significant in
the Liso x Tf-Ep' diagram, where the intrinsic scatter reduces significantly.
We apply further corrections for reducing the intrinsic scatter even more. For
the sub-samples of GRBs (7 from Swift and 5 from CGRO) with measured jet break
time, we analyse the effects of correcting Liso by jet collimation. We find
that (i) the scatter around the correlation is reduced, and (ii) this scatter
is dominated by the internal scatter of the individual evolutionary tracks.
These results suggest that the time, integrated `Amati' and `Ghirlanda'
correlations are consequences of the time resolved features, not of selection
effects, and therefore call for a physical origin. We finally remark the
relevance of looking inside the nature of the evolutionary tracks.

stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We model dSphs
as King spheres embedded in NFW dark halos that orbit the Galactic potential on
eccentric orbits. We find that episodes of stellar mass loss remove the initial
cutoff of the bound stellar core. Once equilibrium has been re-established the
outer mass profile approaches a power-law in projection that is well described
by a simple Plummer model. Tides also result in transient features in the outer
density profile. As the system re-equilibrates, an outward-moving ""excess"" of
stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed
since pericenter. If the orbit is known, these results provide a simple way to
assess whether ""breaks"" and ""bumps"" in the profile of dSphs are actually tidal
in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify
two features in the profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric
passages. Applied to Leo I, we find that any tidal break would locate beyond
the area surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the
detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, the tidal break
should occur at a radius twice farther than observed, suggesting that the outer
excess of stars is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar
comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic
tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless
follows closely a Plummer-law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law
outer profile, suggesting that they have not suffered stellar tidal stripping.
Published profiles for other, fainter Milky Way dSph companions do not extend
sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment.

of tidal debris. The density of debris is not constant, but rather can grow due
to formation of caustics at the apocenters and pericenters of the orbit, or
decay as a result of phase mixing. In the phase space, the debris assemble in a
hierarchy which is truncated by the primordial temperature of dark matter.
Understanding this phase structure can be of significant importance for the
interpretation of many astrophysical observations and in particular dark matter
detection experiments. With this purpose in mind, we develop a general
theoretical framework to describe the hierarchical structure of the phase space
of cold dark matter haloes. We do not make any assumption of spherical symmetry
and/or smooth and continuous accretion. Instead, working with correlation
functions in the action-angle space, we can fully account for the hierarchical
structure (predicting a two-point correlation function ~ (\Delta J)^{-1.6} in
the action space), as well as the primordial discreteness of the phase space.
As an application, we estimate the boost to the dark matter annihilation signal
due to the structure of the phase space within virial radius: the boost due to
the hierarchical tidal debris is of order unity, whereas the primordial
discreteness of the phase structure can boost the total annihilation signal by
up to an order of magnitude. The latter is dominated by the regions beyond 20%
of the virial radius, and is largest for the recently formed haloes with the
least degree of phase mixing.

generic problem with these constructions is, that there are many Yukawa

this paper we consider a number of such settings and study, under what
conditions stringy instanton effects can give rise to non-perturbative
contributions to the Yukawa couplings, so that all perturbatively forbidden
terms are induced. We find specific settings, in which indeed Yukawa couplings
for all fermions are obtained. For some cases we provide specific local
examples of rigid O(1) Instantons within the T^6/ Z2 x Z2' toroidal orientifold
with torsion, giving rise to the required amplitudes. A potential problem in
these settings is, that the same instantons, providing for Yukawa coupling
contributions, may give rise to too large mu-terms for the Higgs multiplets. We
show how this problem may be overcome in explicit models with a doubled Higgs
system.

scanning tunneling microscopy to probe the Fermi surface of the strongly

rather than being globally defined, the Fermi surface changes on nanometer
length scales. Just as shifting tide lines expose variations of water height,
changing Fermi surfaces indicate strong local doping variations. This
discovery, unprecedented in any material, paves the way for an understanding of
other inhomogeneous characteristics of the cuprates, like the pseudogap

<z < 4 allowed the determination of the elemental abundances for a set of
different chemical elements. In this paper, for the first time, by means of
detailed chemical evolution models taking into account also dust production, we
attempt to constrain the star formation history of the host galaxies of these
GRBs from the study of the chemical abundances measured in their ISM. We are
also able to provide constraints on the age and on the dust content of GRB
hosts. Our results support the hypothesis that long duration GRBs occur
preferentially in low metallicity, star forming galaxies. We compare the
specific star formation rate, namely the star formation rate per unit stellar
mass, predicted for the hosts of these GRBs with observational values for GRB
hosts distributed across a large redshift range. Our models predict a decrease
of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) with redshift, consistent with the
observed decrease of the comoving cosmic SFR density between z ~2 and z=0. On
the other hand, observed GRB hosts seems to follow an opposite trend in the
SSFR vs redshift plot, with an increase of the SSFR with decreasing redshift.
Finally, we compare the SSFR of GRB050730 host with values derived for a sample
of Quasar damped Lyman alpha systems. Our results indicate that the abundance
pattern and the specific star formation rates of the host galaxies of these
GRBs are basically compatible with the ones determined in Quasar damped Lyman
alpha systems, suggesting similar chemical evolution paths.

dephasing, entanglement with the environment, and revelation of ""which-path""

experiment. The coupling of the coherent electrons to the quantized
electromagnetic field illustrates all of these versions of decoherence. This
decoherence has two equivalent interpretations, in terms of photon emission or
in terms of Aharonov-Bohm phase fluctuations. We consider the case when the
coherent electrons are coupled to photons in a squeezed vacuum state. The
time-averaged result is increased decoherence. However, if only electrons which
are emitted during selected periods are counted, the decoherence can be
suppressed below the level for the photon vacuum. This is the phenomenon of
recoherence. This effect is closely related to the quantum violations of the
weak energy condition, and is restricted by similar inequalities. We give some
estimates of the magnitude of the recoherence effect and discuss prospects for
observing it in an electron interferometry experiment.

point, or in the ordered phase, respectively. The analysis of the finite-size
string correlation functions allows precise determination of the boundary of
the Haldane phase and estimation of the critical exponent of the correlation
length. Our estimates of the transition point and the critical exponents, which
are determined only by the ground-state quantities, are consistent with results
obtained from the analysis of the energy-level structure. Our analysis requires
only the correlation functions of several finite sizes under the same condition
as a candidate for the long-range order. The quantity is treated in the same
manner irrespective of the kind of elements which destroy the order concerned.
This work will assist in the development of a method to directly observe
quantum phase transitions.

hole into its outside environment due to the Hawking radiation and the energy
accretion onto black hole. Exactly speaking, due to the net energy flow, the
black hole evaporation is a nonequilibrium process. To study details of
evaporation process, nonequilibrium effects of the net energy flow should be
taken into account. In this article we simplify the situation so that the
Hawking radiation consists of non-self-interacting massless matter fields and
also the energy accretion onto the black hole consists of the same fields. Then
we find that the nonequilibrium nature of black hole evaporation is described
by a nonequilibrium state of that field, and we formulate nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of non-self-interacting massless fields. By applying it to black
hole evaporation, followings are shown: (1) Nonequilibrium effects of the
energy flow tends to accelerate the black hole evaporation, and, consequently,
a specific nonequilibrium phenomenon of semi-classical black hole evaporation
is suggested. Furthermore a suggestion about the end state of quantum size
black hole evaporation is proposed in the context of information loss paradox.
(2) Negative heat capacity of black hole is the physical essence of the
generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics, and self-entropy
production inside the matter around black hole is not necessary to ensure the
generalized second law. Furthermore a lower bound for total entropy at the end
of black hole evaporation is given. A relation of the lower bound with the
so-called covariant entropy bound conjecture is interesting but left as an open
issue.

the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In
contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight
generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by
exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,
existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the
samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning
applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received
by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.
  This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a
stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in
the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between
observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based
generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.
These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply
to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of
stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.
  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to
general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,
Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel
regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.
These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the
use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

of the incipient separation as induced by the shock wave/turbulent boundary

of this incipient separation line is the beginning of the separation process.

However, if we consider the Hayden-Preskill argument further, which states that

retention time, then we can show that the Horowitz-Maldaceana proposal cannot
help black hole complementarity. This can be extended to neutral black hole
cases. Therefore, in conclusion, we find that dynamical black holes do not

best chance of revealing scientific truths, carefully designed and executed
randomized experiments are generally considered to be the gold standard.
Observational studies, in contrast, are generally fraught with problems that
compromise any claim for objectivity of the resulting causal inferences. The
thesis here is that observational studies have to be carefully designed to
approximate randomized experiments, in particular, without examining any final
outcome data. Often a candidate data set will have to be rejected as inadequate
because of lack of data on key covariates, or because of lack of overlap in the
distributions of key covariates between treatment and control groups, often
revealed by careful propensity score analyses. Sometimes the template for the
approximating randomized experiment will have to be altered, and the use of
principal stratification can be helpful in doing this. These issues are
discussed and illustrated using the framework of potential outcomes to define
causal effects, which greatly clarifies critical issues.

efficient amplification of the weak pre-collapse fields. It has been suggested
that the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) leads to rapid field growth.
Although MRI studies exist for accretion discs, the application of their
results to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the physics of supernova
cores is substantially different from that of accretion discs. We address the
problem of growth and saturation of the MRI by means of semi-global
simulations, which combine elements of global and local simulations by taking
the presence of global background gradients into account and using a local
computational grid. We analyze the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify
different regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented by
simulations, where we consider a local computational box rotating at
sub-Keplerian velocity, and where we allow for a radial entropy gradient. We
identify six regimes of the MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and
angular velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the instability
criteria and growth rates for all relevant regimes. The MRI grows exponentially
within milliseconds the flow and magnetic field geometries being dominated by
channel flows. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are disrupted by
resistive instabilities (due to finite numerical conductivity), and MHD
turbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of the resistive
instabilities, we deduce scaling laws for the termination amplitude of the MRI
which agree well with our numerical models. We determine the dependence of the
development of coherent flow structures in the saturated state on the aspect
ratio of the simulation boxes. [abridged]

the CFHT-LS to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect to
the whole population of optical galaxies. The availability of multiband
photometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest frame
colors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a B rest-frame
magnitude of M=-20.
  Galaxy properties and luminosity functions (LFs) are estimated up to z~1 for
radio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. Radio loud late type
galaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is an
effect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.
Moreover, we estimate optical LFs, stellar masses and star formation rate
distributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a well
defined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radio
emitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. Radio loud
early type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-optical
LF, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. The lack of evolution of
the mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new AGN are
formed at z<1. On the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strong
evolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio LF for z>0.7. This
evolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this class
and no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.
With the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio LFs for
late type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the Universe up
to z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

disconnected Fermi surface pockets. We have then plugged the susceptibilities

predicted prior to its detection in 1997, in the X-rays, optical and radio. It
is thought to arise from the shock that is driven into the external medium as
the latter decelerates the relativistic outflow that drives the GRB, and
persists well after most of the energy in the outflow is transferred to the
shocked external medium. As the blast wave decelerates, the typical emission
frequency shifts to longer wavelength. Recent observations following the launch

into questions some of the basic underlying concepts. This brief review
outlines some of the major strengths and weaknesses of the standard afterglow

discuss finite temperature effects in superfluids. The main aim is to provide
insight into the modelling of more complex finite temperature superfluid
systems, like the mixed neutron superfluid/proton superconductor that is
expected in the outer core of a neutron star. Our final results can also (to a
certain extent) be used to describe colour-flavour locked quark superconductors
that may be present at the extreme densities in the deep neutron star core. As
a demonstration of the validity of the model, which is based on treating the
excitations in the system as a massless ``entropy'' fluid, we show that it is
formally equivalent to the traditional two-fluid approach for superfluid
Helium. In particular, we highlight the fact that the entropy entrainment
encodes the ``normal fluid density'' of the traditional approach. We also show
how the superfluid constraint of irrotationality reduces the number of
dissipation coefficients in the system. This analysis provides insight into the
more general problem when vortices are present in the superfluid, and we
discuss how the so-called mutual friction force can be accounted for in our
framework. The end product is a hydrodynamic formalism for finite temperature
effects in a single superfluid condensate. This framework can readily be
extended to more complex situations.

was found in the interference between $P$ and $S$ waves at $M_{\pi^+ \pi^-}\sim
1$ GeV. The $S$-wave differential cross section integrated in the mass range of
the $f_0(980)$ was found to be a factor of 50 smaller than the cross section

infrared excess, whose origin is still being debated. A large infrared bow
shock has been discovered using Spitzer/MIPS observations. Although it appears
as a significant contributor to the measured IR excess, the possibility exists
that a circumstellar IR excess is present around the stars of the system. -
Aims: The objective of the present VISIR and NACO observations is to identify
whether one of the stars of the delta Vel system presents a circumstellar
photometric excess in the thermal IR domain and to quantify it. - Methods: We
observed delta Vel using the imaging modes of the ESO/VLT instruments VISIR (in
BURST mode) and NACO to resolve the A-B system (0.6"" separation) and obtain the
photometry of each star. We also obtained one NACO photometry epoch precisely
at the primary (annular) eclipse of delta Vel Aa by Ab. - Results: Our
photometric measurements with NACO (2.17 mic), complemented by the existing
visible photometry allowed us to reconstruct the spectral energy distribution
of the three stars. We then compared the VISIR photometry (8.6-12.8 mic) to the
expected photospheric emission from the three stars at the corresponding
wavelengths. - Conclusions: We can exclude the presence of a circumstellar
thermal infrared excess around delta Vel A or B down to a few percent level.
This supports the conclusions of Gaspar et al. (2008) that the IR excess of
delta Vel has an interstellar origin, although a cold circumstellar disk could
still be present. In addition, we derive the spectral types of the three stars
Aa, Ab, and B (respectively A2IV, A4V and F8V), and we estimate the age of the
system around 400-500 Myr.

Because the vast majority of the variables in this context have a large number

which are summaries of such contingency tables. We propose such an approach in
this paper by finding members of a class of restricted log-linear models which
maximize the likelihood of the data and use this to find a parsimonious means
of representing the table. In contrast with more standard approaches for model
search in hierarchical log-linear models (HLLM), our procedure systematically
reduces the number of categories of the variables. Through a series of
examples, we illustrate the extent to which it can preserve the interaction
structure found with HLLMs and be used as a data simplification procedure prior
to HLL modeling. A feature of the procedure is that it can easily be applied to
many tables with millions of cells, providing a new way of summarizing large
data sets in many disciplines. The focus is on information and description
rather than statistical testing. The procedure may treat each variable in the
table in different ways, preserving full detail, treating it as fully nominal,
or preserving ordinality.

the response of the central kiloparsec region of a gaseous disk to the

of the three axisymmetric components (halo, disk, and bulge) and a
non-axisymmetric bar. These components are assumed to be invariant in time in
the frame corotating with the bar. The potential of spherical $\gamma$-models
of Dehnen is adopted for the bulge component whose density varies as
$r^{-\gamma}$ near the center and $r^{-4}$ at larger radiiand hence, possesses
a central density core for $\gamma = 0$ and cusps for $\gamma > 0$. Since the
central mass concentration of the model galaxies increases with the cusp
parameter $\gamma$, we have examined here the effect of the central mass
concentration by varying the cusp parameter $\gamma$ on the mechanism
responsible for the formation of the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in
barred galaxies. Our simulations show that the symmetric two-armed nuclear
spirals are formed by hydrodynamic spiral shocks driven by the gravitational
torque of the bar for the models with $\gamma = 0$ and 0.5. On the other hand,
the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in the models with $\gamma=1$ and 1.5

a two-sample $t$-statistic for each gene. The LPC method involves projecting
these conventional gene scores onto the eigenvectors of the gene expression
data covariance matrix and then applying an $L_1$ penalty in order to de-noise
the resulting projections. We present a theoretical framework under which LPC
is the logical choice for identifying significant genes, and we show that LPC
can provide a marked reduction in false discovery rates over the conventional
methods on both real and simulated data. Moreover, this flexible procedure can
be applied to a variety of types of data and can be used to improve many

function estimators. They are known to be sensitive to knot number and
placement, but if assumptions such as monotonicity or convexity may be imposed
on the regression function, the shape-restricted regression splines are robust
to knot choices. Monotone regression splines were introduced by Ramsay
[Statist. Sci. 3 (1998) 425--461], but were limited to quadratic and lower
order. In this paper an algorithm for the cubic monotone case is proposed, and
the method is extended to convex constraints and variants such as
increasing-concave. The restricted versions have smaller squared error loss
than the unrestricted splines, although they have the same convergence rates.
The relatively small degrees of freedom of the model and the insensitivity of
the fits to the knot choices allow for practical inference methods; the
computational efficiency allows for back-fitting of additive models. Tests of
constant versus increasing and linear versus convex regression function, when
implemented with shape-restricted regression splines, have higher power than
the standard version using ordinary shape-restricted regression.

Good performance is demonstrated on on AMD's Opteron and particulary good
performance on Intel's Core 2 Duo. The open-source M4RI library is available

  In machine terms, addition in GF(2) is logical-XOR, and multiplication is
logical-AND, thus a machine word of 64-bits allows one to operate on 64
elements of GF(2) in parallel: at most one CPU cycle for 64 parallel additions
or multiplications. As such, element-wise operations over GF(2) are relatively
cheap. In fact, in this paper, we conclude that the actual bottlenecks are
memory reads and writes and issues of data locality. We present our empirical

of a left F-quasigroup with a unique idempotent element and isotope of a
special form of a left distributive quasigroup. The similar theorems are proved
for right F-quasigroups, left and right SM- and E-quasigroups. Information on
simple quasigroups from these quasigroup classes is given, for example, finite
simple F-quasigroup is a simple group or a simple medial quasigroup. It is
proved that any left F-quasigroup is isotopic to the direct product of a group
and a left S-loop. Some properties of loop isotopes of F-quasigroups (including
M-loops) are pointed out. A left special loop is an isotope of a left
F-quasigroup if and only if this loop is isomorphic the direct product of a
group and a left S-loop (this is an answer to Belousov ""1a"", problem). Any left
FESM-quasigroup is isotopic to the direct product of an abelian group and a
left S-loop (this is an answer to Kinyon-Phillips 2.8(2) problem). New proofs
of some known results on the structure of commutative Moufang loops are
presented.

cumulants and diagram formulae associated with functionals of completely random
measures. Our approach is combinatorial, as it is based on the algebraic
formalism of partition lattices and M\""obius functions. Gaussian and Poisson
measures are treated in great detail. We also present several combinatorial
interpretations of some recent CLTs involving sequences of random variables
belonging to a fixed Wiener chaos.
