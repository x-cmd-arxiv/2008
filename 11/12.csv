codes. The entropy of a code for a given quantum channel has a number of
equivalent realisations, such as through the coefficients associated with the
Knill-Laflamme conditions and the entropy exchange computed with respect to any
initial state supported on the code. In general the entropy of a code can be
viewed as a measure of how close it is to the minimal entropy case, which is
given by unitarily correctable codes (including decoherence-free subspaces), or
the maximal entropy case, which from dynamical Choi matrix considerations
corresponds to non-degenerate codes. We consider several examples, including a
detailed analysis in the case of binary unitary channels, and we discuss an
extension of the entropy to operator quantum error correcting subsystem codes.

smooth non-compact manifolds associated to a globally defined and coordinate
independant complete symbol calculus, that generalizes the standard
pseudodifferential calculus on $\R^n$. We consider the case of manifolds $M$
with linearization in the sense of Bokobza-Haggiag, such that the associated
(abstract) exponential map provides global diffeomorphisms of $M$ with $\R^n$
at any point. Cartan--Hadamard manifolds are special cases of such manifolds.
The abstract exponential map encodes a notion of infinity on the manifold that
allows, modulo some hypothesis of $S_\sigma$-bounded geometry, to define the
Schwartz space of rapidly decaying functions, globally defined Fourier
transformation and classes of symbols with uniform and decaying control over
the $x$ variable. Given a linearization on the manifold with some properties of
control at infinity, we construct symbol maps and $\la$-quantization, explicit
Moyal star-product on the cotangent bundle, and classes of pseudodifferential
operators. We show that these classes are stable under composition, and that
the $\la$-quantization map gives an algebra isomorphism (which depends on the
linearization) between symbols and pseudodifferential operators. We study, in
our setting, $L^2$-continuity and give some examples. We show in particular
that the hyperbolic 2-space $\HH$ has a $S_1$-bounded geometry, allowing the
construction of a global symbol calculus of pseudodifferential operators on
$\S(\HH)$.

both away and in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition
(QCP). Previous studies found that (i) the spin susceptibility scales linearly
with either the temperature $T$ or magnetic field H in the weak-coupling
regime; (ii) the interaction in the Cooper channel affects this scaling via
logarithmic renormalization of prefactors of the $T$, |H| terms, and may even
reverse the signs of these terms at low enough energies. We show that Cooper
renormalization becomes effective only at very low energies, which get even
smaller near a QCP. However,even in the absence of such renormalization,
generic (non-Cooper) higher-order processes may also inverse the sign of T,|H|
scaling. We derive the thermodynamic potential as a function of magnetization
and show that it contains, in addition to regular terms, a non-analytic |M|^3
term, which becomes M^4/T at finite $T$. We show that regular (M^2, M^4, ...)
terms originate from fermions with energies of order of the bandwidth, while
the non-analytic term comes from low-energy fermions. We consider the vicinity
of a ferromagnetic QCP by generalizing the Eliashberg treatment of the
spin-fermion model to finite magnetic field, and show that the |M|^3 term
crosses over to a non-Fermi-liquid form |M|^{7/2} near a QCP. The prefactor of
the |M|^{7/2} term is negative, which indicates that the system undergoes a
first-order rather than a continuous transition to ferromagnetism. We compare
two scenarios of the breakdown of a continuous QCP: a first-order instability
and a spiral phase. In a model with a long-range interaction in the spin
channel, we show that the first-order transition occurs before the spiral
instability.

studied by means of numerical simulations. First, we attempt the description of
the evolving interface of the aggregates by applying the well-established
Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling approach. Systematic deviations from that
standard scaling law are observed, suggesting that significant scaling
corrections have to be introduced in order to achieve a more accurate
understanding of the behavior of the interface. Subsequently, we study the
internal structure of the growing aggregates that can be rationalized in terms
of the scaling behavior of frozen trees, i.e., structures inhibited for further
growth, lying below the growing interface. It is shown that the rms height
($h_{s}$) and width ($w_{s}$) of the trees of size $s$ obey power laws of the
form $h_{s} \propto s^{\nu_{\parallel}}$ and $w_{s} \propto s^{\nu_{\perp}}$,
respectively. Also, the tree-size distribution ($n_{s}$) behaves according to
$n_{s}\sim s^{-\tau}$. Here, $\nu_{\parallel}$ and $\nu_{\perp}$ are the
correlation length exponents in the directions parallel and perpendicular to
the interface, respectively. Also, $\tau$ is a critical exponent. However, due
to the interplay between the discrete scale invariance of the underlying
fractal substrates and the dynamics of the growing process, all these power
laws are modulated by logarithmic periodic oscillations. The fundamental
scaling ratios, characteristic of these oscillations, can be linked to the
(spatial) fundamental scaling ratio of the underlying fractal by means of
relationships involving critical exponents.

derived the photometric and kinematical properties of NGC1947. Due to the
presence of an extended dust-lane, which crosses the galaxy center along the
photometric minor axis, we used near-infrared images (J and K bands) to derive
an accurate analysis of the stellar light distribution. Optical images (in the

the structure of the dust-lane. The observed kinematics confirm the presence of
two components with decoupled angular momentum: gas and dust rotate along the

major axis. The complex structure observed in NGC1947 support the hypothesis
that some kind of interactions happened in the evolution of this object. We
analyzed two alternatives: a merging process and an accretion event. We
discussed how the observed properties strongly suggest that the decoupled ring

microscopy of ferroelectric films and crystals is studied using the
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenological approach. The local redistribution
of polarization induced by the biased probe apex is analyzed including the
effects of polarization gradients, field dependence of dielectric properties,
intrinsic domain wall width, and film thickness. The polarization distribution
inside subcritical nucleus of the domain preceding the nucleation event is very
smooth and localized below the probe, and the electrostatic field distribution
is dominated by the tip. In contrast, polarization distribution inside the
stable domain is rectangular-like, and the associated electrostatic fields
clearly illustrate the presence of tip-induced and depolarization field
components. The calculated coercive biases of domain formation are in a good
agreement with available experimental results for typical ferroelectric
materials. The microscopic origin of the observed domain tip elongation in the
region where the probe electric field is much smaller than the intrinsic
coercive field is the positive depolarization field in front of the moving
counter domain wall. For infinitely thin domain walls local domain breakdown
through the sample depth appears. The results obtained here are complementary
to the Landauer-Molotskii energetic approach.

NIR MUSYC, the FIRES, and the GOODS-CDFS surveys, all having very high-quality
optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from
surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way,
allowed us to 1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and
empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; 2)
simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05
times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and 3)
empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass.
We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and
systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs. We find that the mass
density evolves by a factor of ~17(+7,-10) since z=4.0, mostly driven by a
change in the normalization Phi*. If only random errors are taken into account,
we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving
more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no
longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions
are taken into account. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are
in conflict with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict
SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few
high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to
uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass
end may be more difficult to explain.

Survey region and is extended over ~80 kpc. Deep VLBI observations imply that
approximately 50 per cent of the radio emission is extended on scales > 200pc.
The inferred AGN luminosity is sufficient to ionize the extended halo, and the
optical emission is consistent with being triggered coevally with the radio
source. The Lyman-alpha halo is as luminous as those found around high redshift
radio galaxies, however the active nucleus is several orders of magnitude less
luminous at radio wavelengths than those FRIIs more commonly associated with

also find evidence for more quiescent kinematics in the Lyman-alpha emission

more powerful FRIIs. The optical to mid-infrared SED is well described by a

high above the galactic plane and have eccentric orbits show remarkably tight

lines may not be positively correlated in time-resolved measurements. The
relationship between H alpha and Ca II K remains ambiguous for weak and
intermediate activity stars, with H alpha absorption corresponding to a range
of Ca II K emission. A similar relationship is also observed between Ca II K
and the higher order Balmer lines. As our sample consists of a single spectral
type, correlations between these important chromospheric tracers cannot be
ascribed to continuum effects, as suggested by other authors. These data
confirm prior non-simultaneous observations of the H alpha line behavior with
increasing activity, showing an initial increase in the H alpha absorption with
increasing Ca II K emission, prior to H alpha filling in and eventually
becoming a pure emission line in the most active stars. We also compare our
optical measurements with archival UV and X-ray measurements, finding a
positive correlation between the chromospheric and coronal emission for both
high and intermediate activity stars. We compare our results with previous
determinations of the active fraction of low mass stars, and discuss them in

shown that by using some theoretical input, useful information on, say, the

measuring the gravitational redshift one can infer the maximum angular velocity

are found in millisecond pulsars. Here we show that millisecond periods are

for its remarkable sparsity properties. It is shown in this paper that the
solution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it
is the solution to a robust optimization problem. This has two important
consequences. First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a
physical property, namely, protection from noise. This allows a principled
selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that
also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different
uncertainty sets.
  Secondly, robustness can itself be used as an avenue to exploring different
properties of the solution. In particular, it is shown that robustness of the
solution explains why the solution is sparse. The analysis as well as the
specific results obtained differ from standard sparsity results, providing
different geometric intuition. Furthermore, it is shown that the robust
optimization formulation is related to kernel density estimation, and based on
this approach, a proof that Lasso is consistent is given using robustness
directly. Finally, a theorem saying that sparsity and algorithmic stability
contradict each other, and hence Lasso is not stable, is presented.

emission from the daughter ground-state; here we calculate, in a deformed QRPA
model, EC decay rates to all states in the daughter that are allowed by
Gamow-Teller selection rules and energetics. The subsequent branching ratios
between the 1n,...,xn channels and the competing $\gamma$-decay are calculated
in a Hauser-Feshbach model. Since EC accesses excited states, many more
neutrons are emitted in our calculation than in previous work, leading to
accelerated reaction flows. In our multi-component plasma model a single
(EC,xn) reaction step can produce several neutron-deficient nuclei, each of
which can further decay by (EC,xn). Hence, the neutron emission occurs more
continuously with increasing depth as compared to that in a one-component
plasma model.

responses to the animal's position in 2-D space, and have been hypothesized to
form the neural substrate for dead-reckoning. However, in previous models
suggested for grid cell activity, errors accumulate rapidly in the integration
of velocity inputs. To produce grid-cell like responses, these models would
require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues, casting doubt on
the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the
accuracy of path integration in continuous attractor models of grid cell
activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor
models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that
encode only the rat's velocity and heading. We consider the role of the network
boundary in integration performance, and show that both periodic and aperiodic
networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important
differences in their attractor manifolds. We show that the rate at which errors
accumulate in the integration of velocity depends on the network's organization
and size, and on the intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range
of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model can accurately
integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of ~10-100 m and ~1-10 minutes. These
findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may
underlie velocity integration in dMEC. The simulations also generate pertinent
upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous
attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the
continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single
cells establish their responses independently of each other.

estimating treatment effects in the presence of institutionalization during
follow-up can be highly sensitive to assumptions that are unlikely to be met in

consider the use of principal stratification to control for

for similar problems where outcomes are unobservable for samples of study
participants because of dropout, death or other forms of censoring. The method
identifies principal strata within which causal effects are well defined and
potentially estimable. We extend the method of principal stratification to
model institutionalization at follow-up and estimate the effect of residential

adolescent substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, we discuss
practical issues in applying the principal stratification model to data. We
show via simulation studies that the model can only recover true effects

structure formation followed by the MONDian evolution. In MOND the formation of
structures speed up without a need for dark matter. Starting with the top-hat
over-dense distribution of the matter, the structures virialize with a
power--law profile of the distribution of matter. We show that the
virialization process takes place gradually from the center of the structure to
the outer layers. In this scenario the smaller structures enter to the MONDian
regime earlier and evolve faster, hence they are older than larger structures.
We also show that the virialization of the structures occur in the MONDian
regime, in which the smaller structures have stronger gravitational
acceleration than the larger ones. This feature of the dynamical behavior of
the structures is in agreement with this fact that the smaller structures as
the globular clusters or galactic bulges have been formed earlier and need less

hole perturbs the critical current flow over an extended region that is bounded
by a discontinuity line, where the direction of the current density changes

the neighbouring holes. For a cylindrical sample, we construct a polar
triangular hole pattern that exploits this principle; in such a lattice, the

non-magnetic perovskite oxide NdNiO$_3$ in its phase separated state and
provide a physical explanation of the observations. We also model the system
and do an accurate Monte Carlo simulation of the observed behavior. While
cooling a phase separation takes place in this system below its metal-insulator
transition temperature and in this state the material exhibits various
dynamical phenomena such as relaxation of resistivity, dependence of
resistivity on cooling rate and rejuvenation of the material after ageing.
These phenomena signal that the phase separated state of NdNiO$_3$ is not in
thermodynamic equilibrium and we conjecture that it consists of supercooled
paramagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic insulating phases. The supercooled
phases are metastable and they switch over to the insulating equilibrium state
stochastically and this can account for the slow dynamics observed in our
system. We also verify the predictive power of our model by simulating the
result of a new experiment and confirming it by actual measurements.

covers an area of ~ 2.6 arcmin^2 with 10-sigma limiting magnitude exceeding 20
mag in the JHK bands. The survey is sensitive enough to provide unprecedented
details in W3 IRS 5 region and reveals a census of the stellar population down
to objects below the hydrogen-burning limit. We construct JHK color-color (CC)
and J-H/J and H-K/K color-magnitude (CM) diagrams to identify very low
luminosity YSOs and to estimate their masses. Based on these CC and CM
diagrams, we identified a rich population of embedded YSO candidates with
infrared excesses (Class I and Class II), associated with the W3 Main region. A
large number of red sources (H-K > 2) have also been detected around W3 Main.
We argue that these red stars are most probably pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars
with intrinsic color excesses. Based on the comparison between theoretical
evolutionary models of very low-mass PMS objects with the observed CM diagram,
we find there exists a substantial substellar population in the observed
region. The mass function (MF) does not show the presence of cutoff and sharp
turnover around the substellar limit, at least at the hydrogen-burning limit.
Furthermore, the MF slope indicates that the number ratio of young brown dwarfs
and hydrogen-burning stars in the W3 Main is probably higher than those in
Trapezium and IC 348. The presence of mass segregation, in the sense that
relatively massive YSOs lie near the cluster center, is seen. The estimated
dynamical evolution time indicates that the observed mass segregation in the W3
Main may be the imprint of the star formation process.

population-studies or data from disease registries, is defined to be a weighted
average of stratum specific rates. Typically, discussions on the construction
of a particular standardized rate regard the strata as fixed, and focus on the
considerations that affect the specification of weights. Each year the data
from the SEER cancer registries are analyzed using a weighting procedure
referred to as ``direct standardization for age.'' To evaluate the performance
of direct standardization, we define a general class of standardization
operators. We regard a particular standardized rate to be the output of an
operator and a given data set. Based on the functional form of the operators,
we define a subclass of standardization operators that controls for confounding
by measured risk factors. Using the fundamental disease probability paradigm
for inference, we establish the conclusions that can be drawn from year-to-year
contrasts of standardized rates produced by these operators in the presence of
unmeasured cancer risk factors. These conclusions take the form of falsifying
specific assumptions about the conditional probabilities of disease given all
the risk factors (both measured and unmeasured), and the conditional
probabilities of the unmeasured risk factors given the measured risk factors.
We show the one-to-one correspondence between these falsifications and the
inferences made from the contrasts of directly standardized rates reported each
year in the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer.

exhibits selfsimilar fractal fluctuations concomitant with inverse power law
form for power spectrum generic to dynamical systems in nature such as fluid
flows, stock market fluctuations, population dynamics, etc. The physics of
long-range correlations exhibited by fractals is not yet identified. A recently
developed general systems theory visualises the eddy continuum underlying
fractals to result from the growth of large eddies as the integrated mean of
enclosed small scale eddies, thereby generating a hierarchy of eddy
circulations, or an inter-connected network with associated long-range
correlations. The model predictions are as follows: (i) The probability
distribution and power spectrum of fractals follow the same inverse power law
which is a function of the golden mean. The predicted inverse power law
distribution is very close to the statistical normal distribution for
fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean of the distribution.
(ii) Fractals signify quantumlike chaos since variance spectrum represents
probability density distribution, a characteristic of quantum systems such as
electron or photon. (ii) Fractal fluctuations of frequency distribution of
prime numbers signify spontaneous organisation of underlying continuum number
field into the ordered pattern of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern. The
model predictions are in agreement with the probability distributions and power
spectra for different sets of frequency of occurrence of prime numbers at unit

short Re-H-C contact in each case which might indicate the presence of

provided us clear-cut criteria that beta-agostic interactions are suppressed by
the trans-influence of the oxo-groups. Comparison with structurally related
tetra-coordinated d0 titanium amido complexes highlighted a systematic concept
how the extent of beta-agostic interactions in these complexes can be

suggest to employ the expression ""hindered agostic interactions"" in cases where
covalent M-H-C are in principle supported by vacant coordination sites at
Lewis-acidic metal centers but are actually hindered for electronic reasons. We
further point out that electronic hindrance originating from the transinfluence

to the advantage of thin films with a large-surface-to-volume ratio, which

right and efficient use of chaos in the context of cryptography requires a
thorough knowledge about the dynamics of the selected chaotic system. Indeed,
if the final encryption system reveals enough information about the underlying
chaotic system it could be possible for a cryptanalyst to get the key, part of
the key or some information somehow equivalent to the key just analyzing those
dynamical properties leaked by the cryptosystem. This paper shows what those
dynamical properties are and how a cryptanalyst can use them to prove the
inadequacy of an encryption system for the secure exchange of information. This

showing that they have the Lyalpha line in emission. Our main aim is to
investigate their physical properties and their dependence on the emission line
characteristics, to shed light on the relation between galaxies with Lyalpha
emission and the general LBG population.The objects were selected from their
continuum colors and then spectroscopically confirmed by the GOODS
collaboration and other campaigns. From the spectra we derived the line flux
and EW. We then used U-band to mid-IR photometry from GOODS-MUSIC to derive the
physical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, age and so on,
through standard SED fitting techniques.Although most galaxies are fit by young
stellar populations, a small but non negligible fraction has SEDs that require
considerably older stellar component, up to 1 Gyr. There is no apparent
relation between age and EW: some of the oldest galaxies have large EW, and
should be also selected in narrow band surveys. Therefore not all Lyalpha
emitters are primeval galaxies in the very early stages of formation,as is
commonly assumed. We also find a large range of stellar populations, with
masses from 5x10^8 Msol to 5x10^10 Msol and SFR from few to 60 Msol/yr.
Although there is no correlation between mass and EW, we find a significant
lack of massive galaxies with high EW, which could be explained if the most
massive galaxies were more dusty and/or contained more neutral gas than less
massive objects. Finally we find that more than half of the galaxies contain
small but non negligible amounts of dust: the mean E(B-V) and the EW are well
correlated, although with a large scatter, as already found at lower redshift

single layer graphene sheet in the presence of screened Coulomb interactions.
At half filling and weak enough coupling, we compute the free energy, the
ground state energy and we construct the correlation functions up to zero
temperature in terms of convergent series; analiticity is proved by making use
of constructive fermionic renormalization group methods. We show that the
interaction produces a modification of the Fermi velocity and of the wave
function renormalization without changing the asymptotic infrared properties of
the model with respect to the unperturbed non-interacting case; this rules out
the possibility of superconducting or magnetic instabilities in the ground
state. We also prove that the correlations verify a Ward Identity similar to
the one for massless Dirac fermions, up to asymptotically negligible
corrections and a renormalization of the charge velocity.

scale consideration of a graphene Aharonov-Bohm ring equipped with valley
filters on both terminals, encircling a dislocation, says that in the regime
where the intervalley mean free path is large compared to the intravalley phase
coherence length, such that the valley quantum numbers can be regarded as

leading to an apparent violation of the basic law of linear transport that
magnetoconductance is even in the applied flux. We discuss this discrepancy in

quantum to classical dissipative transport. We also investigate this device in
the scattering matrix formalism, accounting for the effects of decoherence by
the Buttiker dephasing voltage probe type model which conserves the valleys,

indication of the black hole spin. The method is applied to a sample of 19 very

via molecular exchange with exchange time constants of 10-30 ms at room

anisotropic intermolecular interactions, it forms islands that are compact in
shape with crystallographically distinct boundaries that have essentially
identical thermodynamic and kinetic properties . The physical basis of the
modified symmetry is shown to arise from significantly different substrate
interactions induced by alternating orientations of successive molecules in the

gas model leads to effective multi-component behavior, as in the

particular, the binary may produce a variable electromagnetic flux, such as a
roughly periodic signal due to the orbital motion prior to coalescence, or a
prompt transient signal caused by shocks in the circumbinary disk when the
SMBHB recoils and ""shakes"" the disk. We discuss whether these time-variable EM
signatures may be detectable, and how they can help in identifying a unique
counterpart within the localization errors provided by LISA. We also discuss a
possibility of identifying a population of coalescing SMBHBs statistically, in
a deep optical survey for periodically variable sources, before LISA detects
the GWs directly. The discovery of such sources would confirm that gas is
present in the vicinity and is being perturbed by the SMBHB - serving as a

of the conductivity and the resulting charge carrier densities with respect to
the doping level. The increase of charge carrier density due to extrinsic
doping were compared to the accumulation of charge carriers in field effect
transistor structures. This allowed to assess the scattering effects due to
extrinsic doping on the electron mobility. The latter decreases from 4.6*10^-3
cm^2/Vs to 4.5*10^-4 cm^2/Vs with increasing doping density. In contrast, the
accumulation leads to an increasing mobility up to 1.5*10^-2 cm^2/Vs. The
potential barrier heights related to grain boundaries between the crystallites

doping initially leads to a grain boundary barrier height lowering, followed by
an increase due to doping-induced structural defects. We conclude that the
