motion commensurability with masses ranging from the super Jovian range to the
terrestrial range to stochastic forcing that could result from protoplanetary
disk turbulence. The behaviour of the different libration modes for a wide
range of system parameters and stochastic forcing magnitudes is investigated.
The growth of libration amplitudes is parameterized as a function of the
relevant physical parameters. The results are applied to provide an explanation
of the configuration of the HD128311 system.
  Methods. We first develop an analytic model from first principles without
making the assumption that both eccentricities are small. We also perform
numerical N-body simulations with additional stochastic forcing terms to
represent the effects of putative disk turbulence.
  Results. Systems are quickly destabilized by large magnitudes of stochastic
forcing but some stability is imparted should systems undergo a net orbital
migration. The slow mode, which mostly corresponds to motion of the angle
between the apsidal lines of the two planets, is converted to circulation more
readily than the fast mode which is associated with oscillations of the
semi-major axes. This mode is also vulnerable to the attainment of small
eccentricities which causes oscillations between periods of libration and
circulation.
  Conclusions. Stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have played a role
in shaping the configurations of observed systems in mean motion resonance. It
naturally provides a mechanism for accounting for the HD128311 system.

morphological transitions of giant vesicles induced by AC electric fields (1).
The model treats the inner and suspending media as lossy dielectrics, while the
membrane as an ion-impermeable flexible incompressible-fluid sheet. The vesicle
shape is obtained by balancing electric, hydrodynamic, and bending stresses
exerted on the membrane. Considering a nearly spherical vesicle, the solution
to the electrohydrodynamic problem is obtained as a regular perturbation
expansion in the excess area.
  The theory predicts that stationary vesicle deformation depends on field
frequency and conductivity conditions. If the inner fluid is more conducting
than the suspending medium, the vesicle always adopts a prolate shape. In the
opposite case, the vesicle undergoes a transition from a prolate to oblate
ellipsoid at a critical frequency, which the theory identifies with the inverse
membrane charging time. At frequencies higher than the inverse Maxwell-Wagner
polarization time, the electrohydrodynamic stresses become too small to alter
the vesicle's quasi-spherical rest shape. The analysis shows that the evolution
towards the stationary vesicle deformation strongly depends on membrane
properties such as viscosity. The model can be applied to rationalize the
transient and steady deformation of biological cells in electric fields.

horizon first pointed out by Poisson & Israel (1990), who called it mass
inflation. The chief purpose of this paper is to present a clear exposition of
the physical cause and consequence of inflation in spherical, charged black
holes. Inflation acts like a particle accelerator in that it accelerates cold
ingoing and outgoing streams through each other to prodigiously high energies.
Inflation feeds on itself: the acceleration is powered by the gravity produced
by the streaming energy. The paper: (1) uses physical arguments to develop
simple approximations that follow the evolution of inflation from ignition,
through inflation itself, to collapse; (2) confirms that the simple
approximations capture accurately the results of fully nonlinear one- and
two-fluid self-similar models; (3) demonstrates that, counter-intuitively, the
smaller the accretion rate, the more rapidly inflation exponentiates; (4) shows
that in single perfect-fluid models, inflation occurs only if the sound speed
equals the speed of light, supporting the physical idea that inflation in
single fluids is driven by relativistic counter-streaming of waves; (5) shows
that what happens during inflation up to the Planck curvature depends not on
the distant past or future, but rather on events happening only a few hundred
black hole crossing times into the past or future; (6) shows that, if quantum
gravity does not intervene, then the generic end result of inflation is not a
general relativistic null singularity, but rather a spacelike singularity at
zero radius.

order for the theory to produce definite predictions. In particular, the EC
theory with fermions is shown to be indistinguishable from usual General
Relativity on the effective level, if the flat space fermionic Lagrangean is
appropriately chosen. Hence, the solution to the problem of nonuniqueness of

slow-roll inflation. Here we generalize the step feature to include
space-dependence, allowing it also to model a breakdown of homogeneity and
isotropy. The space-dependent inflaton potential generates a classical
curvature perturbation mode characterized by the wavenumber of the step
inhomogeneity. For inhomogeneities small compared with the horizon at the step,
space-dependence has a small effect on the curvature perturbation. Therefore
the smoothly oscillating quantum power spectrum predicted by the homogeneous
step is robust with respect to sub-horizon space-dependence. For
inhomogeneities equal to or greater than the horizon at the step, the
space-dependent classical mode can dominate, producing a curvature perturbation
in which modes of wavenumber determined by the step inhomogeneity are
superimposed on the oscillating power spectrum. Generation of a space-dependent
step feature may therefore provide a mechanism to introduce primordial
anisotropy into the curvature perturbation. Space-dependence also modifies the
quantum fluctuations, in particular via resonance-like features coming from

phenomenon, which has no classical analog. Quantum revival, and Anderson
localization, are members of a small class of subtle interference effects
resulting in a quantum distribution radically different from the classical

not clear that semiclassical methods, which start with the classical density
and add interference effects, are in fact capable of capturing the revival

infinite square well and Morse potential. In both cases, after a long time the
underlying classical manifolds are spread rather uniformly over phase space and
are correspondingly spread in coordinate space, yet the semiclassical

forward angles. We decompose the experimental velocity distributions
empirically into two contributions: a direct, `breakup' component centered at
beam velocity and a dissipative component at lower velocities leading to a tail
of the velocity distributions. The direct component is interpreted in the
Goldhaber model, and the widths of the velocity distributions are extracted.
The dissipative component is then successfully described by transport
calculations. The ratio of the yields of the direct and the dissipative
contributions can be understood from the behavior of the deflection functions.
The isotope distributions of the dissipative component agree qualitatively with
the data, but the modification due to secondary de-excitation needs to be
considered. We conclude, that such reactions are of interest to study the
equilibration mechanism in heavy ion collisions.

To describe the spatial distributions of the species we use a model based on

interaction parameter between the two preys, and a multiplicative white noise
affects directly the dynamics of each one of the three species. We study the

two-dimensional lattice with N sites and applying a mean field approach, we get
the corresponding moment equations in Gaussian approximation. Within this
formalism we obtain the time behaviour of the first and second order moments

to the same dichotomous noise source. Finally, we compare our results with

of a compact object in the mildly eccentric (e=0.35), 3.9-day orbit around a
massive O star. The nature of the compact object is not yet established. In
this paper, assuming that the compact object is a black hole, we study the
accretion of O-star wind by the black hole, by performing three-dimensional
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. In order to roughly emulate
the effect of the stellar radiation effectively canceling the stellar gravity,
we assume that the O star's gravity does not exert on the wind. The wind
particles are ejected with half the observed terminal velocity in a narrow
range of azimuthal and vertical angles toward the black hole, in order to
emulate the wind significantly slower than the terminal speed, and optimize the
resolution and computational efficiency of simulations. We find that the
mass-accretion rate closely follows the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton
accretion rate, which is of the order of 10^{16}g/s around periastron. The
accretion rate at this level would provide jets enough power to produce the
gamma-rays detected by HESS. Since the accretion peak occurs near the
periastron passage, we need a strong gamma-ray absorption around periastron in
order for the microquasar scenario to be consistent with the observed orbital
modulation of the TeV gamma-ray flux.

one month, reaching a peak observed flux density of ~100 mJy on 2007 January
28, and decaying to ~50 mJy by 2007 May when our last monitoring observation
was made. Two additional faint, isolated 235 MHz detections were made in

we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc for

determined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location within
the galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometric
observations of molecular (CO using PdBI) and atomic (HI using the VLA) gas.
The results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and the
dynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several different
methods. We show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transporting
gas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at ~100 pc;
previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the Corotation
Resonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by gravitational torque induced
gas flows from other non-axisymmmetric structures. The resulting rates of gas
mass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 solar masses per year and are larger for the
galaxy center than for the outer disk. Our gas flow maps show the action of
nested bars within larger bars for 3 galaxies. Non-circular streaming motions
found in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk and
appear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function of
radius. We demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems that
undergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g. 5
times 10^8 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitational
torques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.

distribution sampled with contamination, employing a statistical technique
known as ``expectation maximization'' (EM). Given models for both member and
contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership
probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to
update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM
approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we
tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the
Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar
radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples are
presented in a companion paper and contain discrete measurements of
line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and Mg index for ~1000 - 2500 stars
per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way
stars. The EM algorithm quantifies both dSph and contaminant distributions,
returning maximum-likelihood estimates of the means and variances, as well as
the probability that each star is a dSph member. Applied to our MMFS data, the
EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 probable dSph members. We test the
performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range
of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and
contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples
ranging from large (N ~3000) to small (N~30), the EM algorithm distinguishes
members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more
reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma
clipping).

(MS) we investigate the alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure.
For this purpose we develop two new statistical tools, namely the alignment
correlation function and the cos(2theta)-statistic. The former is a
two-dimensional extension of the traditional two-point correlation function and
the latter is related to the ellipticity correlation function used for cosmic
shear measurements. Both are based on the cross correlation between a sample of
galaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents the
large-scale structure. Applied to the SDSS galaxy catalog the alignment
correlation function reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along the
major axes of red, luminous (L > L*) galaxies out to projected separations of
60 Mpc/h. No alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. The
cos(2\theta)-statistic yields very similar results. Starting from a MS
semi-analytic galaxy catalog we assign an orientation to each red, luminous and
central galaxy, based on the central region of the host halo. Alternatively, we
use the orientation of the host halo itself. We find a mean projected
misalignment between a halo and its central region of ~25 deg. Agreement with
the SDSS results is good if the central orientations are used. Using the halo
orientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2.
The large volume of the MS allows to generate two-dimensional maps of the
alignment correlation function which show the reference galaxy distribution to
be flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axis
ratios of ~0.5 and ~0.75 for halo and central orientations,respectively. These
ratios are almost independent of scale out to 60 Mpc/h.

of quantum gravity effects. The two simplest dispersion relationships produce
either linear or quadratic corrections, in particle energy, to the photon
speed. The macroscopic limits of these theories -- how objects with small
energy per particle, but with large mass, behave -- are not fully understood.
We here briefly discuss some features of the macroscopic limit, that are
necessary for understanding how detectors and emitters interact with the
high-energy photons that probe spacetime.

statistical techniques developed for luminosity function estimation leads to
statistically biased results. We derive the likelihood function for the BHMF
based on the broad line mass estimates, and derive the posterior distribution
for the BHMF, given the observed data. We develop our statistical approach for
a flexible model where the BHMF is modelled as a mixture of Gaussian functions.
Statistical inference is performed using markov chain monte carlo (MCMC)
methods. Our method has the advantage that it is able to constrain the BHMF
even beyond the survey detection limits at the adopted confidence level,
accounts for measurement errors and the intrinsic uncertainty in broad line
mass estimates, and provides a natural way of estimating the probability
distribution of any quantities derived from the BHMF. We conclude by using our
method to estimate the local active BHMF using the z < 0.5 Bright Quasar Survey
sources. At z = 0.2, the quasar BHMF falls off approximately as a power law
with slope ~ 2 for M_{BH} > 10^8. Our analysis implies that z < 0.5 broad line
quasars have a typical Eddington ratio of ~ 0.4 and a dispersion in Eddington
ratio of < 0.5 dex (abridged).

low/high-end exponents alpha = -2.00 +/- 0.05, -6.4^{+1.1}_{-1.6}. The shape of
f(N,X) is invariant during this redshift interval and also follows the
projected surface density distribution of present-day HI disks as inferred from
21cm observations. We conclude that HI gas has been distributed in a
self-similar fashion for the past 12Gyr. The normalization of f(N,X), in
contrast, decreases by a factor of two during the ~2Gyr interval from z=4 to
2.2 giving corresponding decreases in both the total covering fraction and
rho_HI. At z~2, these quantities match the present-day values suggesting no
evolution during the past ~10Gyr. We argue that the evolution at early times is
driven by `violent' processes that removes gas from nearly half the galaxies at
z~3 establishing the antecedants of current early-type galaxies. The perceived
constancy of rho_HI, meanwhile, implies that HI gas is a necessary but
insufficient pre-condition for star formation and that the global
star-formation rate is driven by the accretion and condensation of fresh gas
from the intergalactic medium.

in explaining various phenomena without the need for dark matter. However, it
is difficult to observationally discern the differences between TeVeS and
predictions made within the Lambda-cold dark matter concordance model. This
implies that alternative tests are required that independently verify which
theory is correct. For this we turn to the strong-field regime of TeVeS. In
particular, we solve the spherically symmetric equations of hydrostatic
equilibrium for a perfect fluid with a realistic equation of state to build
models of neutron stars in TeVeS. We show that causality within the neutron
star is only maintained for certain cosmological values of the scalar field,
which allows us to put constraints on this value independently of cosmological
observations. We also discuss in detail the internal structure of neutron stars
and how each of the free parameters in the theory effects the overall size and
mass of the neutron stars. In particular, the radii of neutron stars in TeVeS
can significantly differ from those in General Relativity for certain values of
the vector field coupling, which allows us to also place extra constraints on
this parameter. Finally, we discuss future observations of neutron stars using
both the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectrums that will allow for

radiation pressure. Since most starlight is in ionizing radiation, most of its
outward push will act on the H^+ region and then on to the H^0 region. The
magnetic pressure in the H^0 region balances the momentum in starlight and
together they set the location of the H^0 region. The picture is that, when the

wavelengths, our results match a wide range of current observations and
generate predictions for future data sets. We reproduce the weak luminosity
dependence of clustering over the currently well-measured range, and predict a
much stronger dependence at higher luminosities. The increase in the amplitude
of binary quasar clustering observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is
also reproduced and is predicted to occur at higher redshift, an effect that is
due to the one halo term in the correlation function. On the other hand, our
results do not match the rapid evolution of the correlation length observed in
the SDSS at z\simeq 3, a discrepancy that is at least partially due to
differences in the scales probed by our simulation versus this survey. In fact,
we show that changing the distances sampled from our simulations can produce
changes as large as 40% in the fitted correlation lengths. Finally, in the
X-ray, our simulations produce correlation lengths similar to that observed in

In the high temperature confining region, the one-loop effective potential for
Polyakov loops has a Z(N)-symmetric confining minimum. String tensions
associated with Polyakov loops are smooth functions of m/T. In the magnetic
sector, the Polyakov loop plays a role similar to a Higgs field, leading to a
breaking of SU(N) to U(1)^{N-1}. This is turn yields an effective theory where
magnetic monopoles give rise to string tensions for spatial Wilson loops. These

technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously
with correlated traits. In this study, we propose a new statistical framework
called graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) to address this issue in a principled
way. Our approach explicitly represents the dependency structure among the
quantitative traits as a network, and leverages this trait network to encode
structured regularizations in a multivariate regression model over the
genotypes and traits, so that the genetic markers that jointly influence
subgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected with high sensitivity and
specificity. While most of the traditional methods examined each phenotype
independently and combined the results afterwards, our approach analyzes all of
the traits jointly in a single statistical method, and borrow information
across correlated phenotypes to discover the genetic markers that perturbe a
subset of correlated triats jointly rather than a single trait. Using simulated
datasets based on the HapMap consortium data and an asthma dataset, we compare
the performance of our method with the single-marker analysis, and other sparse
regression methods such as the ridge regression and the lasso that do not use
any structural information in the traits. Our results show that there is a
significant advantage in detecting the true causal SNPs when we incorporate the
correlation pattern in traits using our proposed methods.

reduction mechanisms have been proposed, including the burial of the field by a
magnetic mountain, formed when the accreted matter is confined to the poles by
the tension of the stellar magnetic field. A magnetic mountain effectively
screens the magnetic dipole moment. On the other hand, observational data
suggests that accreting neutron stars are sources of gravitational waves, and
magnetic mountains are a natural source of a time-dependent quadrupole moment.
We show that the emission is sufficiently strong to be detectable by current
and next generation long-baseline interferometers. Preliminary results from
fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are presented. We
find that the initial axisymmetric state relaxes into a nearly axisymmetric

loop model on the honeycomb lattice is equivalent to the zero-temperature
triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, which is fully frustrated and
notoriously difficult to simulate. We test this worm algorithm numerically and
estimate the dynamic exponent z = 0.515(8). We also measure several static

numerically that the face-size moments are governed by the magnetic dimension

superconductor CePt3Si without inversion symmetry through 195Pt-NMR study on a
single crystal with T_c= 0.46 K that is lower than T_c= 0.75 K for
polycrystals. We show that the intrinsic superconducting characteristics
inherent to CePt3Si can be understood in terms of the unconventional
strong-coupling state with a line-node gap below T_c= 0.46 K. The mystery about
the sample dependence of T_c is explained by the fact that more or less
polycrystals and single crystals inevitably contain some disordered domains,
which exhibit a conventional BCS s-wave superconductivity (SC) below 0.8 K. In
contrast, the Neel temperature T_N= 2.2 K is present regardless of the quality
of samples, revealing that the Fermi surface responsible for SC differ from
that for the antiferromagnetic order. These unusual characteristics of CePt3Si
can be also described by a multiband model; in the homogeneous domains, the
coherent HF bands are responsible for the unconventional SC, whereas in the
disordered domains the conduction bands existing commonly in LaPt3Si may be
responsible for the conventional s-wave SC. We remark that some impurity
scatterings in the disordered domains break up the 4f-electrons-derived
coherent bands but not others. In this context, the small peak in 1/T_1 just
below T_c reported in the previous paper (Yogi et al, 2004) is not due to a
two-component order parameter composed of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper
pairing states, but due to the contamination of the disorder domains which are
in the s-wave SC state.

$z\sim0.9$, using data from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey. Automatic measurement of
emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the full
spectroscopic sample. This sample is divided into two sub-samples depending on
the apparent magnitude selection: wide ($I_{\mathrm{AB}}<22.5$) and deep
$I_{\mathrm{AB}}<24$). These two samples span two different ranges of stellar
masses. Emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxies
and active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. For the star-forming
galaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phase
oxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to give
consistent results at low and high redshifts. The stellar masses have been
estimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set of
stellar population synthesis models. We assume at first order that the shape of
the mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. Then we find a
stronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deep
sample. We thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter at
higher redshift. The observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation at
high redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.

waveforms from circular compact binaries introduced in Refs.
\cite{Damour:2007xr,Damour:2007yf}. One of the characteristic features of this
resummation method is to replace the usual {\it additive} decomposition of the
standard post-Newtonian approach by a {\it multiplicative} decomposition of the
complex multipolar waveform $h_{\lm}$ into several (physically motivated)
factors: (i) the ""Newtonian"" waveform, (ii) a relativistic correction coming
from an ""effective source"", (iii) leading-order tail effects linked to
propagation on a Schwarzschild background, (iv) a residual tail dephasing, and
(v) residual relativistic amplitude corrections $f_{\lm}$. We explore here a
new route for resumming $f_{\lm}$ based on replacing it by its $\ell$-th root:
$\rho_{\lm}=f_{\lm}^{1/\ell}$. In the extreme-mass-ratio case, this resummation
procedure results in a much better agreement between analytical and numerical
waveforms than when using standard post-Newtonian approximants. We then show
that our best approximants behave in a robust and continuous manner as we
""deform"" them by increasing the symmetric mass ratio $\nu\equiv m_1
m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2$ from 0 (extreme-mass-ratio case) to 1/4 (equal-mass case). The
present paper also completes our knowledge of the first post-Newtonian
corrections to multipole moments by computing ready-to-use explicit expressions
for the first post-Newtonian contributions to the odd-parity (current)

treated as a canonical ensemble of independent particles is studied in a wide
range of particle numbers and temperatures which vary from values close to zero
up to the Fermi energy. The temperature evolution of C is naturally divided
into four stages. On the first one the heat capacity exponentially increases
with temperature and at a resonance temperature reaches either a local maximum
or an irregularity in its growth. This resonance temperature being measured can
give information concerning the level spacings in the immediate proximity of
the Fermi energy. On the second stage the progressive suppression of the level
density oscillations takes place. During this stage oscillations of C v.s.
particle number N can be distinctly observed. These oscillations give the
N-variations of the temperature averaged level density. The growth of C on the
third stage of the evolution is governed by the T-linear law if the particle
number is large enough (N>1000). It is found that the Sommerfeld factor in the
linear law for such small systems shows more complicated N-dependence as
compared with large systems where C is strictly proportional to N. For
temperatures tending to the Fermi energy the deviations from the T-linearity
are evident and at T larger than the Fermi energy (the fourth stage of the

a model tip-sample system, we choose Fe tips and one monolayer Fe on W(001)
which exhibits a checkerboard antiferromagnetic structure and has been
previously studied with both SP-STM and MExFM. We calculate the exchange forces
and energies as a function of tip-sample distance using different tip models
ranging from single Fe atoms to Fe pyramids consisting of up to 14 atoms. We
find that modelling the tip by a single Fe atom leads to qualitatively
different tip-sample interactions than using clusters consisting of several
atoms. Increasing the cluster size changes the calculated forces quantitatively
enhancing the detectable exchange forces. Rotating the tip with respect to the
surface unit cell has only a small influence on the tip-sample forces.
Interestingly, the exchange forces on the tip atoms in the nearest and
next-nearest layers from the apex atom are non-negligible and can be opposite
to that on the apex atom for a small tip. In addition, the apex atom interacts
not only with the surface atoms underneath but also with nearest-neighbors in
the surface. We find that structural relaxations of tip and sample due to their
interaction depend sensitively on the magnetic alignment of the two systems. As
a result the onset of significant exchange forces is shifted towards larger
tip-sample separations which facilitates their measurement in MExFM. At small
tip-sample separations, structural relaxations of tip apex and surface atoms

vortices.
  Alternatively, topological vortices in external field are constructed in the
phenomenological model proposed by Zhang-Hansson-Kivelson. Non-relativistic
Maxwell-Chern-Simons vortices are also studied.

explained, by 1D spherical radiation transport calculations covering a wide
range of model parameters (e.g., WD mass). The observations of SN 2006gz are
naturally explained by the super-Chandrasekhar-mass model. SN 1991T represents
a marginal case, which may either be a Chandrasekhar or a
super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD explosion. On the other hand, the low velocity and
short time-scale seen in SN 2003fg indicate that the ejecta mass is smaller
than the Chandrasekhar-mass, which is an apparent contradiction to the large
luminosity. We suggest that the problem is solved if the progenitor WD, and
thus the SN explosion, is aspherical. This may reflect a rapid rotation of the
progenitor star, likely a consequence of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD
progenitor. The observed differences between SNe 2003fg and 2006gz may be
attributed to different viewing orientations.

voting on a set of complex multidimensional issues. We consider agents which
can classify issues into for or against. The agents arrive at the opinions
about each issue in question using an adaptive algorithm. Adaptation comes from
learning and the information for the learning process comes from interacting
with other neighboring agents and trying to change the internal state in order
to concur with their opinions. The change in the internal state is driven by
the information contained in the issue and in the opinion of the other agent.
We present results in a simple yet rich context where each agent uses a Boolean
Perceptron to state its opinion. If there is no internal clock, so the update
occurs with asynchronously exchanged information among pairs of agents, then
the typical case, if the number of issues is kept small, is the evolution into
a society thorn by the emergence of factions with extreme opposite beliefs.
This occurs even when seeking consensus with agents with opposite opinions. The
curious result is that it is learning from those that hold the same opinions
that drives the emergence of factions. This results follows from the fact that
factions are prevented by not learning at all from those agents that hold the
same opinion. If the number of issues is large, the dynamics becomes trapped
and the society does not evolve into factions and a distribution of moderate
opinions is observed. We also study the less realistic, but technically simpler
synchronous case showing that global consensus is a fixed point. However, the
approach to this consensus is glassy in the limit of large societies if agents
adapt even in the case of agreement.

quantum physics. Being essentially finite-dimensional, they cannot accomodate
(co)limit-based constructions. For example, they cannot capture protocols such
as quantum key distribution, that rely on the law of large numbers. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce the notion of a compactly accessible category,
relying on the extra structure of a factorisation system. This notion allows
for infinite dimension while retaining key properties of compact categories:
the main technical result is that the choice-of-duals functor on the compact
part extends canonically to the whole compactly accessible category. As an
example, we model a quantum key distribution protocol and prove its correctness
categorically.

studied. Depending on the geometry, selection rules are found for the
occurrence of slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures, as well
as for resonant behavior of the a.c. susceptibility as a function of

stationary-state properties in terms of the transient density correlators. A

theory, L. Lorenz published his theory equating light vibrations with electric
currents. Starting from Kirchhoff's Ohm's law expression, Lorenz introduces
scalar potential retardation to obtain an expression for the electric field
using retarded potentials. In his theory Lorenz sets the vacuum light speed
equal to \sqrt{2}/2 times Weber's measured superluminal value for magnetic
induction speed. Using the wave equation Green's function paradigm Lorenz
reduces his integral, retarded Ohm's law formulation to a differential
formulation for current density. This represents his solution to the
electromagnetic action at a distance problem. During the reduction he presents
a light like, plane wave solution for current density that can not satisfy
initial conditions on the expanding wave front and, using a faulty by parts
integration that neglects retardation, he develops the eponymic Lorenz
condition. Although generally accepted, this condition relates vector and
scalar potentials erroneously. A proper relation is given and major
consequences are developed in appendices. As a finale Lorenz suggests a light
model that I interpret as magnetoinductive waves. Such waves are only now being
studied using Kirchhoff's laws without retardation. I redo this important paper
using modern day notation with critical annotations. This elevates the paper to
a teaching tool position in the millennial search to understand light's dual
nature as wave and corpuscle and brings us full circle, back to Kirchhoff's
laws where Lorenz began.

Hence, evolution of real GDP is defined by only one parameter - the number of
people of the specific age. Predictions for the USA, the UK, and France are

hydrodynamic and nuclear evolution from the initial parabolic orbit over the
disruption to the build-up of an accretion disk around the black hole. For
strong enough encounters (pericentre distances smaller than about 1/3 of the
tidal radius) the tidal compression is reversed by a shock and finally results
in a thermonuclear explosion. These explosions are not restricted to progenitor
masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, we find exploding examples throughout
the whole white dwarf mass range. There is, however, a restriction on the
masses of the involved black holes: black holes more massive than $2\times
10^5$ M$_\odot$ swallow a typical 0.6 M$_\odot$ dwarf before their tidal forces
can overwhelm the star's self-gravity. Therefore, this mechanism is
characteristic for black holes of moderate masses. The material that remains
bound to the black hole settles into an accretion disk and produces an X-ray
flare close to the Eddington limit of $L_{\rm Edd} \simeq 10^{41} {\rm erg/s}

of a peculiar thermonuclear supernova together with an X-ray flare thus

We find a large variety of orbital compositions. Averaged over all sample

direction are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent in
individual systems. In contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxies
the vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other two
directions. This implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals are
flattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. Using
three-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellar
anisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.
Collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. The apparent lack
of strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that they
may not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipational

mass scale of invisible particles pair-produced at hadron colliders. We
introduce the constrained mass variable M_3C which provides an event-by-event
lower bound and upper bound to the mass scale given the two mass differences
between the lightest three new particle states. This variable is most
appropriate for short symmetric cascade decays involving two-body decays and
on-shell intermediate states which end in standard-model particles and two
dark-matter particles. An important feature of the constrained mass variables
is that they do not rely simply on the position of the end point but use the
additional information contained in events which lie far from the end point. To
demonstrate our method we study the supersymmetric model SPS 1a. We select cuts
to study events with two Neutralino_2 each of which decays to Neutralino_1, and
two opposite-sign same-flavor (OSSF) charged leptons through an intermediate
on-shell slepton. We find that with 300 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity the
invisible-particle mass can be measured to M=96.4 +/- 2.4 GeV. Combining fits
to the shape of the M_3C constrained mass variable distribution with the max
m_ll edge fixes the mass differences to +/- 0.2 GeV.

(BEC) in a double well trap considering a semiclassical approach based on a
time dependent variational principle applied to coherent states associated to
SU(2) group. Employing a two-mode local approximation and hard sphere type
interaction, we show in the Schwinger's pseudo-spin language the occurrence of
a fixed point bifurcation that originates a separatrix of motion on a sphere.
This separatrix corresponds to the borderline between two dynamical regimes of
Josephson oscillations and mesoscopic self-trapping. We also consider the
effects of interaction between particles in different wells, known as cross
collisions. Such terms are usually neglected for traps sufficiently far apart,
but recently it has been shown that they contribute to the effective tunneling
constant with a factor growing linearly with the particle number. This effect
changes considerably the effective tunneling of the system for sufficiently
large number of trapped atoms, in perfect accord with experimental data.
Finally, we identify analytically the transition parameter associated to the
bifurcation in the generalized phase space of the model with cross-collision
terms, and show how the dynamical regime depends on the initial conditions of
the system and the collisional parameters values.

yielded a fairly large sample of narrow molecular emission lines with
line-widths indicating expansion velocities of ~4 km/s, less than 3 times the
well-known value of the terminal expansion velocity (14.5 km/s) of the outer
envelope. Five of these narrow lines have now been identified as rotational
transitions in vibrationally excited states of previously detected molecules:
the v=1, J=17--16 and J=19--18 lines of Si34S and 29SiS and the v=2, J=7--6

within ~60 AU of the star, indicating that the narrow-line emission is probing
the region of dust-formation where the stellar wind is still being accelerated.

containing charmed or bottom quarks. The sum rules depend only on the
assumption that baryon mass differences are determined by spin-dependent
two-body energies of quark pairs that do not depend on which baryon the quark
pair is in. No assumption is made about the details of the quark-quark
interaction. The sum rules are generally well satisfied, although better
experimental accuracy would be required for a quantitative test of some of the
sum rules. The success of the sum rules is evidence that ""baryon independence""
of quark-quark interaction is a good assumption for baryon mass calculations.
It also means that the success of some detailed baryon mass calculations may
not depend on the specific mechanism used in the calculation.

by inertial wave packets through the fluid volume. These waves propagate at
velocities consistent with those calculated from linearized theory, even when
they possess large amplitudes. A clear ""front"" in the temporal evolution of the
energy power spectrum is detected, defining a time scale for energy transport
at the linear wave speed in the system. Nonlinear energy transfer between modes
is governed by a different time scale that can be much longer than the linear
one. These observations suggest that the energy distribution and statistics in
rotating turbulent fields that are driven by intermittent energy sources may be
different from those described by the inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional
turbulence.

orbital information and halo properties of such an equal mass merger system.
Together with the sophisticated search strategy of Minga, one needs fast and
reliable models in order to investigate the high dimensional parameter space of
this problem. Therefore we use a restricted N-body code which is based on the
approach by Toomre & Toomre (1972), however with some refinements like
consistent orbits of extended dark matter halos. Recently also dynamical
friction was included to this code (Petsch 2007). While a good description for
dynamical friction was found for mass ratios up to q = 1/3 (Petsch & Theis
2008), major merger systems were only imperfectly remodeled. Here we show
recent improvements for a major merger system by including mass-loss and using
NFW halos.

Objects (EROs), which are red, massive galaxies observed at z >= 1. One of the
models invokes a ""superwind"" to regulate star formation in massive haloes and
the other suppresses cooling through ""radio-mode"" AGN feedback. The first one
underestimates the number counts of EROs by an order of magnitude, whereas the
radio-mode AGN feedback model gives excellent agreement with the number counts
of EROs and redshift distribution of K-selected galaxies. This study highlights
the need to consider AGN feedback in order to understand the formation and
evolution of massive galaxies at z >= 1.
