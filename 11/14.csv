we present a numerical model of how Fomalhaut's debris disk is gravitationally
shaped by an interior planet. The model is simple, adaptable to other debris
disks, and can be extended to accommodate multiple planets. If Fom b is the
dominant perturber of the belt, then to produce the observed disk morphology it
must have a mass < 3 Jupiter masses. If the belt and planet orbits are
apsidally aligned, our model predicts a planet mass of 0.5 Jupiter masses. The
inner edge of the debris disk at 133 AU lies at the periphery of Fom b's
chaotic zone, and the mean disk eccentricity of 0.11 is secularly forced by the
planet, supporting predictions made prior to the discovery of Fom b. However,
previous mass constraints based on disk morphology rely on several
oversimplifications. We explain why our constraint is more reliable. It is
based on a global model of the disk that is not restricted to the planet's
chaotic zone boundary. Moreover, we screen disk parent bodies for dynamical
stability over the system age of 100 Myr, and model them separately from their
dust grain progeny; the latter's orbits are strongly affected by radiation
pressure and their lifetimes are limited to 0.1 Myr by destructive grain-grain
collisions. The single planet model predicts that planet and disk orbits be
apsidally aligned. Fom b's nominal space velocity does not bear this out, but
the astrometric uncertainties may be large. If the apsidal misalignment is
real, our upper mass limit of 3 Jupiter masses still holds. The belt contains
at least 3 Earth masses of solids that are grinding down to dust. Such a large
mass in solids is consistent with Fom b having formed in situ.

to a certain probability density $f(\eta)$ and a single deformation parameter
$\gamma$. Three superstatistical classes for $f(\eta)$ are usually considered:
$\chi^2$-, inverse $\chi^2$- and log-normal-distributions. While the first
class, already considered by two of the authors, leads to a power-law decay of
the spectral density, we here introduce and solve exactly a superposition of
Wishart-Laguerre ensembles with inverse $\chi^2$-distribution. The
corresponding macroscopic spectral density is given by a $\gamma$-deformation
of the semi-circle and Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur laws, on a non-compact support with
exponential tails. After discussing in detail the validity of Wigner's surmise

surmise with stretched-exponential tails, which well approximates the
individual level spacing distribution in the bulk. The analytical results are
in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. To illustrate our findings

probability distributions of random reverse transaction (ie closing of the
position). This type of market games is often considered in the research aiming
at finding an algorithm that maximizes profit of a trader who negotiates prices
with the Rest of the World (a collective opponent) that posses a definite and
objective supply profile. Such idealization neglects the sometimes important
influence of an individual trader on the demand/supply profile of the Rest of
the World and in extreme cases questions the very idea of demand/supply
profile. Therefore we put forward a trading model in which the demand/supply
profile of the Rest of the World induces the (rational) trader to
(subjectively) presume that he/she lacks (almost) all knowledge concerning the
market but his/hers average frequency of trade. This point of view introduces
maximum entropy principles into the model and broadens the range of economics
phenomena that can be perceived as a sort of thermodynamical system. As a
consequence, the profit intensity has a fixed point:the profit in tensity
reaches its maximum when the probability of transaction is given by the Golden
Ratio rule $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.

this work we extend the determination of metallicities up to redshift = 1.24
for a sample of 42 star-forming galaxies with a mean redshift value of 0.99.
Methods. For a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use both
diagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [OII] emission lines
along with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [OIII] and
[NeIII] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between Balmer recombination
emission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive their
metallicities. We derive stellar masses by fitting the whole spectral energy
distribution with a set of stellar population synthesis models. Results. These
new methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higher
redshift. We show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with more
established strong-line methods. Taken together this allows us to study the
evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control of
systematic uncertainties. We find an evolution with redshift of the average
metallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for a
given stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dex
lower than galaxies in the local universe. However we do not see any
significant metallicity evolution between redshifts z = 0.7 (Paper I) and z =
1.0 (this paper). We find also the same flattening of the mass-metallicity
relation for the most massive galaxies as reported in Paper I at lower
redshifts, but again no apparent evolution of the slope is seen between z = 0.7
and z = 1.0.

of EROs by an order of magnitude, whereas the radio-mode AGN feedback model
gives excellent agreement with the number counts and redshift distribution of
EROs. In the AGN feedback model the ERO population is dominated by old,
passively evolving galaxies, whereas observations favour an equal split between
old galaxies and dusty starbursts. Also, the model predicts a more extended
redshift distribution of passive galaxies than is observed. These comparisons
suggest that star formation may be quenched too efficiently in this model.

This yields asymptotic error control under minimal conditions. It involves,
however, a one-time random split of the data. Results are sensitive to this
arbitrary choice: it amounts to a `p-value lottery' and makes it difficult to
reproduce results. Here, we show that inference across multiple random splits
can be aggregated, while keeping asymptotic control over the inclusion of noise
variables. We show that the resulting p-values can be used for control of both
family-wise error (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR). In addition, the
proposed aggregation is shown to improve power while reducing the number of
falsely selected variables substantially.

scaling of the transition temperature with the thickness L_0 of the film. The
predictions of the renormalization group (RG) theory are confirmed. We compute
the universal ratio of the thickness of the film L_0 and the transversal
correlation length \xi_T in the three-dimensional thermodynamic limit at the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of a film of thickness L_0:
[L_{0,KT}/\xi_T]^* = 1.595(7). This results can be compared with experimental

(1908) widely favoured protostome-deuterostome division of the Bilateria can be
upheld, but only with major rearrangements within these superphyla. On the
cladogenetic level, the Protostomia are split into two unexpected subgroups,
the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. The deuterostomes are split into the
subgroups Chordata and Ambulacraria, which is not novel since Grobben (1908)
introduced the Deuterostomia in this way (together with the Chaetognatha as a
third line). However, many details of the new deuterostome phylogeny do not fit
traditional, morphology-based reconstructions. As a consequence, three
relatively unexpected proposals for early deuterostome evolution are favoured
today: An ambulacraria-scenario, a xenoturbellid-scenario, and a
chordate-scenario. The first two proposals are often discussed in the
literature, while the chordate-scenario is almost completely neglected.
Therefore, the paper presented focuses on the chordate scenario, i.e. the
hypothesis of an acrania-like ur-deuterostomian. It is argued that the
acrania-hypothesis is clearly preferable when biomechanic options of a
polysegmented, hydroskeletal body plan are taken into account. The so called
hydroskeleton hypothesis, rooted in the work of W. F. Gutmann, is the most
detailed anagenetic scenario which depicts an acrania-like ur-deuterostome.

Second order accurate divergence-free schemes for MHD have shown themselves to

black hole (LQBH) in the conservative approach of constant polymeric parameter.
In particular we have focused our attention on the space-time structure. We
have introduced a very simple modification of the spherically symmetric
Hamiltonian constraint in its holonomic version. The new quantum constraint
reduces to the classical constraint when the polymeric parameter goes to
zero.Using this modification we have obtained a large class of semiclassical
solutions parametrized by a generic function of the polymeric parameter. We
have found that only a particular choice of this function reproduces the black
hole solution with the correct asymptotic flat limit. In r=0 the semiclassical
metric is regular and the Kretschmann invariant has a maximum peaked in
L-Planck. The radial position of the pick does not depend on the black hole
mass and the polymeric parameter. The semiclassical solution is very similar to
the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. We have constructed the Carter-Penrose diagrams
explicitly, giving a causal description of the space-time and its maximal
extension. The LQBH metric interpolates between two asymptotically flat
regions, the r to infinity region and the r to 0 region. We have studied the
thermodynamics of the semiclassical solution. The temperature, entropy and the
evaporation process are regular and could be defined independently from the
polymeric parameter. We have studied the particular metric when the polymeric
parameter goes towards to zero. This metric is regular in r=0 and has only one
event horizon in r = 2m. The Kretschmann invariant maximum depends only on
L-Planck. The polymeric parameter does not play any role in the black hole
singularity resolution. The thermodynamics is the same.

reduce to a certain generalization of the DGP 4D effective theory. We argue
that for infrared modifications of GR locally due to a universally coupled
scalar, our generalization is the only one that allows for a robust
implementation of the Vainshtein effect--the decoupling of the scalar from
matter in gravitationally bound systems--necessary to recover agreement with
solar system tests. Our generalization involves an internal ``galilean''
invariance, under which \pi's gradient shifts by a constant. This symmetry
constrains the structure of the \pi Lagrangian so much so that in 4D there
exist only five terms that can yield sizable non-linearities without
introducing ghosts. We show that for such theories in fact there are
``self-accelerating'' deSitter solutions with no ghost-like instabilities. In
the presence of compact sources, these solutions can support spherically
symmetric, Vainshtein-like non-linear perturbations that are also stable
against small fluctuations. [Short version for arxiv]

data on thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) and X-ray imaging, thereby avoiding to
use any information on X-ray spectroscopy. This method, which represents a
development of the geometrical deprojection technique presented in Ameglio et
al. (2007), implements the solution of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In
order to quantify the efficiency of our mass reconstructions, we apply our
technique to a set of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. We propose
two versions of our method of mass reconstruction. Method 1 is completely
model-independent, while Method 2 assumes instead the analytic mass profile
proposed by Navarro et al. (1997) (NFW). We find that the main source of bias
in recovering the mass profiles is due to deviations from hydrostatic
equilibrium, which cause an underestimate of the mass of about 10 per cent at
r_500 and up to 20 per cent at the virial radius. Method 1 provides a
reconstructed mass which is biased low by about 10 per cent, with a 20 per cent
scatter, with respect to the true mass profiles. Method 2 proves to be more
stable, reducing the scatter to 10 per cent, but with a larger bias of 20 per
cent, mainly induced by the deviations from equilibrium in the outskirts. To
better understand the results of Method 2, we check how well it allows to
recover the relation between mass and concentration parameter. When analyzing
the 3D mass profiles we find that including in the fit the inner 5 per cent of
the virial radius biases high the halo concentration. Also, at a fixed mass,
hotter clusters tend to have larger concentration. Our procedure recovers the
concentration parameter essentially unbiased but with a scatter of about 50 per
cent.

  Efficient techniques for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)

space-time Galerkin formulation instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski

  The schemes reported here have all been implemented in the RIEMANN framework
for computational astrophysics. We demonstrate that the ADER-WENO meet their
design accuracies. Several stringent test problems of Euler flows and MHD flows
are presented in one, two and three dimensions. Many of our test problems
involve near infinite shocks in multiple dimensions and the higher order

structure with the space group of I4/mmm, and with the lattice constants a =

lattice which is close to that of other FeAs-based superconductors, such as
REFeAsO (RE = rare earth elements) and (Ba,Sr)Fe_2As_2. However the inter
FeAs-layer spacing in the new compound is greatly enlarged. The temperature
dependence of resistivity exhibits a weak upturn in the low temperature region,
but a metallic behavior was observed above about 60 K. The magnetic
susceptibility shows also a non-monotonic behavior. Interestingly, the
well-known resistivity anomaly which was discovered in all other parent
compounds, such as REFeAsO, (Ba,Sr)Fe_2As_2 and (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF and associated
with the Spin-Density-Wave (SDW)/structural transition has not been found in
the new system either on the resistivity data or the magnetization data. This
could be induced by the large spacing distance between the FeAs-planes,
therefore the antiferromagnetic correlation between the moments of Fe ions in
neighboring FeAs-layers cannot be established. Alternatively it can also be
attributed to the self-doping effect between Fe and Sc ions. The Hall
coefficient R_H is negative but strongly temperature dependent in wide

electron-like charge carriers and probably a multi-band effect or a spin
related scattering effect. It is found that the magnetoresistance cannot be

Yang-Mills in D dimensions. The gauge couplings exhibit logarithmic scaling and
asymptotic freedom in the upper critical spacetime dimension, equal to 4+1. The
theories can be deformed in the infrared by a relevant operator that restores
Poincare invariance as an accidental symmetry. In the large-N limit, our
nonrelativistic gauge theories can be expected to have weakly curved gravity

a coexistence of superfluid and Mott insulating domains, we use local
quantities such as the quantum fluctuations of the density and a local

the Universe. The origin of this kind of systems is still not well understood.
The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the different locations of
dwarf galaxies with respect to ellipticals in the face-on view of the
fundamental plane could be due to the transformation of bright disc galaxies in
low-mass systems by harassment. We have run high-resolution N-body numerical
simulations to test the tidal stripping scenario of the dE galaxies. The
present simulations modelled several individual tidal stripping events on
initial disc-like galaxy models with different bulge-to-disc mass ratios. Tidal
stripping is a very efficient mechanism for removing stars and dark matter
particles from galaxies. The particles of the disc and halo components were
easily stripped, while the bulge not. Thus, the scale length of the discs were
40-50% shorter than the initial ones. Prograde tidal interactions create tidal
features like stable bars in the discs of the galaxies. After several tidal
interactions the galaxy remnants looks like a dwarf spheroidal system.
Simulated galaxies with initial large B/D ratios are closer to the face-on view
of the fundamental plane defined by bright E and bulges of early-type galaxies.
Nevertheless, galaxies with initial small B/D ratio are located, after four
fast tidal encounters, at the position of dE galaxies in the face-on view of
the fundamental plane. We conclude that fast galaxy-galaxy interactions are
efficient mechanisms for transforming bright galaxies in dwarf ones. Indeed,
the different location observed between Es and dEs in the face-on view of the
fundamental plane can be explained by the formation of dwarf galaxies by
harassment of late-type bright ones.

a small amount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) could turn off photomeson

cosmic background radiation and thereby eliminate the resulting sharp
steepening in the spectrum of the highest energy CRs predicted by Greisen
Zatsepin and Kuzmin (GZK). Recent measurements of the UHECR spectrum reported
by the HiRes and Auger collaborations, however, indicate the presence of the
GZK effect. We present the results of a detailed calculation of the
modification of the UHECR spectrum caused by LIV using the formalism of Coleman
and Glashow. We then compare these results with the experimental UHECR data
from Auger and HiRes. Based on these data, we find a best fit amount of LIV of
$4.5^{+1.5}_{-4.5} \times 10^{-23}$,consistent with an upper limit of $6 \times
10^{-23}$. This possible amount of LIV can lead to a recovery of the cosmic ray
spectrum at higher energies than presently observed. Such an LIV recovery

multi-band catalogues with an emphasis on reliable estimates for object
colours. These are subsequently used for photometric redshift estimates. The
article explains in detail data processing, multi-colour catalogue creation and
photometric redshift estimation. Furthermore we apply a novel technique, based
on studies of the angular galaxy cross-correlation function, to quantify the
reliability of photo-z's. The accuracy of our high-confidence photo-z sample
(10-15 galaxies per sq. arcmin) is estimated to $\sigma_{\Delta_z/(1+z)}\approx
0.04-0.05$ up to i'<24 with typically only 1-3% outliers. Interested users can

both distorted-wave and R-matrix calculations. The value of the GD ratio (an
extended definition of the G ratio that accounts for the effect of resolved and
unresolved satellite lines) is significantly enhanced at temperatures below the
temperature of He-like maximum abundance. Furthermore it is shown that
satellite lines are important contributors to the GD ratio such that GD/G>1 at

satellite lines, that K ALPHA satellite lines need to be included in models of
He like spectra even at relatively high temperatures. The excellent agreement
between spectra and line ratios calculated from R-matrix and distorted-wave

evolution of abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies. In particular, the
time-scales for the enrichment by SNe II and SNe Ia are crucial in interpreting
the evolution of abundance ratios such as [alpha/Fe]. In fact, the
alpha-elements are produced mainly by SNe II on time-scales of the order of 3
to 30 Myr, whereas the Fe is mainly produced by SNe Ia on a larger range of
time-scales, going from 30 Myr to a Hubble time. This produces differences in
the [alpha/Fe] ratios at high and low redshift and it is known as ""time-delay""
model. In this talk we review the most common progenitor models for SNe Ia and
the derived rates together with the effect of the star formation history on the
[alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram in the Galaxy. From these diagrams we can
derive the timescale for the formation of the inner halo (roughly 2 Gyr), the
timescale for the formation of the local disk (roughly 7-8 Gyr) as well the
time-scales for the formation of the whole disk. These are functions of the
galactocentric distance and vary from 2-3 Gyr in the inner disk up to a Hubble
time in the outer disk (inside-out formation). Finally, the timescale for the
formation of the bulge is found to be no longer than 0.3 Gyr, similar to the
timescale for the formation of larger spheroids such as elliptical galaxies. We
show the time-delay model applied to galaxies of different morphological type,
identified by different star formation histories, and how it constrains

that the density dependent part of the heat capacity vanishes linearly with
temperature. We also observe a zero sound excitation in the collisionless
regime, whose speed is equal to that of normal sound in the hydrodynamic
regime. Both the linear dependence of the heat capacity and the existence of
zero sound are properties of the Fermi liquid ground state. We also compute the
two-point function of the currents at vanishing frequency but do not find any
singularities at finite values of the momentum.

pressure-induced quantum phase transition from a gapped singlet state to an
antiferromagnetic state at P_c = 0.042 GPa. Antiferromagnetic ordering with

phase transition from the oblique antiferromagnetic (OAF) phase to the

the competition between the anisotropic energies of the conventional second

by the conjecture that the Hopkins-Miller tmf spectrum can be described in
terms of `spaces' of conformal field theories. In this dissertation, spaces of
field theories are constructed as classifying spaces of categories whose
objects are certain types of field theories. If such a category has a symmetric
monoidal structure and its components form a group, by work of Segal, its
classifying space is an infinite loop space and defines a cohomology theory.
This has been carried out for two classes of field theories: (i) For each
integer n, there is a category SEFT_n whose objects are the Stolz-Teichner
(1|1)-dimensional super Euclidean field theories of degree n. It is proved that
the classifying space |SEFT_n| represents degree-n K or KO cohomology,
depending on the coefficients of the field theories. (ii) For each integer n,
there is a category AFT_n whose objects are a kind of (2|1)-dimensional field
theories called `annular field theories,' defined using supergeometric versions
of circles and annuli only. It is proved that the classifying space |AFT_n|
represents the degree-n elliptic cohomology associated with the Tate curve. To
the author's knowledge, this is the first time the definitions of
low-dimensional supersymmetric field theories are given in full detail.

active regions of specific magnetic configurations and their evolutions give
high productivity of C class flares but relatively low productivity of

active regions of specified types are observed to have high energetic flare
productivity, above 66%. The periodicity of the activity revealed can be used
for medium-term C and M class flare forecasting and the high productivity of

introduce a minimal model in which there are two types of packets distinguished

Fractal SF networks contain local hubs, which are repulsive to each other.
Those hubs attract particles and accelerate the reaction, and then create
domains containing the same species of particles. It follows that the reaction
takes place at the non-hub boundaries between those domains and thus the

concentration regime the resistivity has been found to increase linearly with
$x$ until $\approx$ 10% Cr where the resistivity reaches a plateau persisting
to $\approx$ 20% Cr. In this paper we present $ab$-$initio$ calculations of
$\rho(x)$ which explain this anomalous behavior and which are based on the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) method in conjunction with the Kubo-Greenwood
formalism. Furthermore we are able to show that the effects of short-range

results we study the alloys' electronic structure by calculating the Bloch
spectral function particularly in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. From the

should also be obtained for iron-rich Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$ alloys - an inference
confirmed by further explicit resistivity calculations. Both of these alloy
systems belong to the same branch of the famous Slater-Pauling plot and we
postulate that other alloy systems from this branch should show a similar
behavior. Our calculations show that the appearance of the plateau in the
resistivity can be attributed to the dominant contribution of minority spin
electrons to the conductivity which is nearly unaffected by increase in Cr/V
concentration $x$ and we remark that this minority spin electron feature is
also responsible for the simple linear variation of the average moment in the

correlations between the zeros of elliptic curve $L$-functions averaged within

this is known to be the true for the one- and two-level densities of zeros
within the families studied to date. However, for finite conductor Miller's
experimental data reveal an interesting discrepancy from these limiting
results. Here we use the L-functions ratios conjectures to calculate the
1-level density for the family of even quadratic twists of an elliptic curve
L-function for large but finite conductor. This gives a formula for the leading
and lower order terms up to an error term that is conjectured to be
significantly smaller. The lower order terms explain many of the features of
the zero statistics for relatively small conductor and model the very slow
convergence to the infinite conductor limit.
  However, our main observation is that they do not capture the behaviour of
zeros in the important region very close to the critical point and so do not
explain Miller's discrepancy. This therefore implies that a more accurate model
for statistics near to this point needs to be developed.

almost insensitive to the downstream distribution of magnetic field and

emission from all spatial structures with angular scales from few arcseconds to
15 arcmin. We explore different models of injection efficiency and find the
following best-fitting values for the aspect angle of SN 1006: phi=70 +/- 4.2
deg if the injection is isotropic, phi=64 +/- 2.8 deg for quasi-perpendicular
injection (SNR has an equatorial belt in both cases) and phi=11 +/- 0.8 deg for
quasi-parallel injection (polar-cap model of SNR). In the last case, SN 1006 is
expected to have a centrally-peaked morphology contrary to what is observed.
Therefore, our analysis provides some indication against the quasi-parallel

1050 K, which we attribute to emission by circumnuclear dust located closer
than 25 pc from the nucleus, with total mass of ~3x10^{-3}M_Sun. Surrounding
the nucleus, we observe a ring of active star formation with radius of ~190 pc,
an age of ~5 Myr. The radiation of the young stars in the ring accounts for at
least 80 % of the ionization observed in the Brgamma emitting gas, the
remaining being due to radiation emitted by the active nucleus. The stellar
kinematics reveals: (1) a distorted rotation pattern in the radial velocity
field with kinematic center apparently displaced from the nuclear source by a
few tens of parsecs; (2) a high velocity dispersion in the bulge of sigma=170
km/s; (3) a partial ring of sigma=50 km/s interpreted as due to stars formed
from cold gas in a previous burst of star formation. The kinematics of the
ionized gas shows an additional blueshifted component with velocities > 100
km/s interpreted as due to an outflow along the ionization cone. The mass
outflow rate in the ionized gas was estimated as ~0.05 M_Sun/yr, which is one
order of magnitude larger than the accretion rate to the AGN. The flux
distribution and kinematics of the hot molecular gas, traced by the H2l2.22um

excess blueshift along PA~-70 can be interpreted as an inflow towards the

in modeling complex real-world systems. Among the many dynamical processes
involving networks, propagation processes -- in which final state can be
obtained by studying the underlying network percolation properties -- have
raised formidable interest. In this paper, we present a bond percolation model
of multitype networks with an arbitrary joint degree distribution that allows
heterogeneity in the edge occupation probability. As previously demonstrated,
the multitype approach allows many non-trivial mixing patterns such as
assortativity and clustering between nodes. We derive a number of useful
statistical properties of multitype networks as well as a general phase
transition criterion. We also demonstrate that a number of previous models
based on probability generating functions are special cases of the proposed
formalism. We further show that the multitype approach, by naturally allowing
heterogeneity in the bond occupation probability, overcomes some of the
correlation issues encountered by previous models. We illustrate this point in
the context of contact network epidemiology.

observe that the absolute losses slightly decrease up to a BaZrO$_3$ content of
5%, and then increase. We found that the magnetic-field-induced losses behave
differently, in that they are not monotonic with increasing BaZrO$_3$
concentration: at small concentration (2.5%) the field-induced losses increase,
but large reduction of the losses themselves, by factors up to 3, is observed
upon further increasing the BaZrO$_3$ concentration in the target up to 7%.
Using measurements of both surface resistance and surface reactance we estimate
vortex pinning-related parameters. We find that BaZrO$_3$ inclusions introduce
deep and steep pinning wells. In particular, the minimum height of the energy
barrier for single vortices is raised. At larger BaZrO$_3$ content (5% and 7%)
the phenomenon is at its maximum, but it is unclear whether it shows a
saturation or not, thus leaving room for further improvements.

linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The Coulomb matrix is a central
ingredient in implementations of many-body perturbation theory, such as the
Hartree-Fock and GW approximations for the electronic self-energy or the
random-phase approximation for the dielectric function. It is represented in
the mixed product basis, which combines numerical muffin-tin functions and
interstitial plane waves that are here expanded with the Rayleigh formula. The
resulting algorithm is very efficient in terms of both computational cost and
accuracy and is superior to an implementation with the Fourier transform of the
step function. In order to allow an analytic treatment of the divergence at k=0
in reciprocal space, we expand the Coulomb matrix analytically around this
point without resorting to a projection onto plane waves. We then apply a basis
transformation that diagonalizes the Coulomb matrix and confines the divergence
to a single eigenvalue. At the same time, response matrices like the dielectric
function separate into head, wings, and body with the same mathematical
properties as in a plane-wave basis. As an illustration we apply the formulas
to electron-energy-loss spectra for nickel at different k vectors including
k=0. The convergence of the spectra towards the result at k=0 is clearly seen.
Our treatment also allows to include transitions from core states that give
rise to a shallow peak at high energies and lead to good agreement with
experiment.
