dust particles in a sample of 12 protoplanetary disks to see how they are
connected to interstellar dust particles and to investigate the possibility
that their emission can be used as a probe of the physical conditions and
evolution of the disk. We define a basis made of three mid-IR template spectra
PAH$^0$, PAH$^+$ and VSGs that were derived from the analysis of reflection
nebulae, and an additional PAH$^x$ spectrum that was introduced by Joblin et
al. (2008) for the analysis of the spectra of planetary nebulae. From the
optimization of the fit of 12 star+disk spectra, using a linear combination of
the 4 template spectra, we found that an additional small grain component with
a broad feature at 8.3 $\mu$m is needed. We find that the fraction of VSG
emission in disks decreases with increasing stellar temperature. VSGs appear to
be destroyed by UV photons at the surface of disks, thus releasing free PAH
molecules, which are eventually ionized as it is observed in photodissociation
regions. On the opposite, we observe that the fraction of PAH$^x$ increases
with increasing star temperature except in the case of B stars where they are
absent. We argue that this is compatible with the identification of PAH$^x$ as
large ionized PAHs, most likely emitting in regions of the disk that are close
to the star. Finally, we provide a UV-dependant scheme to explain the evolution
of PAHs and VSGs in protoplanetary disks. We show that A stars modify the size
spectrum of PAHs and VSGs in favor of large PAHs while B stars destroy even the
largest PAHs up to large radii in the disk. These results allow us to put new
constrains on the properties of two sources: IRS 48 and ""Gomez's Hamburger""

It is found that the velocity distributions appear to be composed of two
contributions: a direct component centered at beam velocity and a dissipative
component at lower energies, leading to an asymmetry of the velocity
distributions. The direct component is interpreted empirically in the Goldhaber
model, and the widths and centroids of the distributions are extracted. The
remaining dissipative (also called deep-inelastic) contributions are then well
described by the transport calculations. It is shown that the ratio of yields

recombination rates is based on the relativistic Breit-Pauli R-matrix method
and close coupling approximation. Extending the theoretical formulation
developed earlier we present recombination rate coefficients for the 22

isolated resonance approximation, commonly used throughout plasma modeling,
treats these resonances essentially as bound features except for dielectronic
capture into, and autoionization out of, these levels. A line profile or cross
section shape is often assumed. On the other hand, by including the coupling
between the autoionizing and continuum channels, the unified method gives the
intrinsic spectrum of DES lines which includes not only the energies and
strengths, but also the natural line or cross section shapes. A formulation is
presented to derive autoionization rates from unified resonance strengths and
enable correspondence with the isolated resonance approximation. While the
rates compare very well with existing rates for the strong lines to <20%, the
differences for weaker DES lines are larger. We also illustrate the application
of the present results to the analysis of K ALPHA complexes observed in

the present accelerating stage of the universe which does not depend on the
validity of general relativity, as well as on the matter-energy content of the
Universe. In this context, we consider here a linear two-parameter expansion
for the decelerating parameter, $q(z)=q_0+q_1z$, where $q_0$ and $q_1$ are
arbitrary constants to be constrained by the Union supernovae data. By assuming
a flat Universe we find that the best fit to the pair of free parameters is
($q_0,q_1$) = ($-0.73,1.5)$ whereas the transition redshift is $z_t =
0.49^{+0.14}_{-0.07}$ ($1\sigma$) $^{+0.54}_{-0.12}$ ($2\sigma$). This
kinematic result is in agreement with some independent analyzes and
accommodates more easily many dynamical flat models (like $\Lambda$CDM).

which can release considerable gravitational waves (GW). We demonstrate that
bubble collisions can leave an observable signature for future high-frequency
probes of GWs, such as advanced LIGO, LISA and BBO. A ""smoking gun"" for chain
inflation would be wiggles in the spectrum (and consequently in the tensor
spectral index) due to the multiple phase transitions. The spectrum could also
be distinguished from a single first order phase transition by a small
difference in the amplitude at low frequency. A second origin of GWs in chain
inflation are tensor modes from quantum fluctuations; these GW can dominate and
be observed on large scales. The consistency relation between scalar and tensor
modes is different for chain inflation than for standard rolling models and is
testable by Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. If inflation happened
through a series of rapid tunnelings in the string landscape, future high
frequency probes of GW can shed light on the structure of the landscape.

being given here are based on work done very recently and there is really no
attempt being made to critically review what has taken place in the last 90 or
100 years. Instead, in general the participants accept without question that
cosmology equates to ""hot big bang cosmology"" with all of its bells and
whistles. All of the theory and the results obtained from observations are
interpreted on the assumption that this extremely popular model is the correct
one, and observers feel that they have to interpret its results in terms of
what this theory allows. No one is attempting to seriously test the model with
a view to accepting it or ruling it out. They are aware, as are the theorists,
that there are enough free parameters available to fix up almost any model of
the type.
  The current scheme given in detail for example by Spergel et al (206, 2007)
demonstrates this. How we got to this stage is never discussed, and little or
no attention is paid to the observations obtained since the 1960s on activity
in the centers of galaxies and what they imply. We shall show that they are an
integral part of a realistic cosmological model. In this paper I shall take a
different approach, showing first how cosmological ideas have developed over
the last 90 years and where mistakes have been made. I shall conclude with a
realistic model in which all of the observational material is included, and
compare it with the popular model. Not surprisingly I shall show that there
remain many unsolved problems, and previously unexpected observations, most of
which are ignored or neglected by current observers and theorists, who believe
that the hot big bang model must be correct.

We analyze full and partial integrability (closeness) condition of the entropy

ferroelectric crystal media point. We show that the thermodynamical phase space
(TPS) introduced by R.Hermann and widely exploited by R. Mrugala with his
collaborators and other researchers, extended possibly by time, with its
canonical contact structure is an appropriate setting for the development of
material point models in different physical situations. This allows us to
formulate the model of a material point and the corresponding entropy form in
terms similar to those of the homogeneous thermodynamics. Closeness condition
of the entropy form is reformulated as the requirement that the admissible
processes curves belongs to the constitutive surface S of the model.
  Our principal result is the description of the constitutive surfaces S of the
material point model as the Legendre submanifolds of the TPS shifted by the
flow of Reeb vector field. This shift is controlled, at the points of Legendre
submanifold by the entropy production function $\sigma$.

treatment is studied. The experiments are conducted by using X-ray diffraction
with an area detector. The evolution of crystallographic orientation is tracked
by calculating the pole figures and by applying a quantitative 3D texture
component fit method. The rolling orientation after a true strain of -1.5
mainly consists of the (010)[001], (130)[001], and [001]//RD fiber components
(RD: rolling direction). The results reveal that the crystallinity drastically
decreases during rolling. We suggest that decrystallization (disaggregation) is
a deformation mechanism which takes place as a microscopic alternative to
crystallographic intralamellar shear depending on the orientation of the
lamellae relative to the imposed deformation tensor. Heat treatment after
rolling leads to the recrystallization of amorphous material and to a strong
enhancement of the fiber orientation component. The recrystallization
orientation is explained in terms of an oriented nucleation mechanism where
amorphous material aligns along existing crystalline lamellae blocks which
prevailed during the preceding deformation.

the use of the Hbeta emission line, has to be preferred to the [OII]3727

has been studied and modeled using various approaches. In this paper we use a
modified version the Sheth & Lemson algorithm for a $\mathrm{\Lambda}$ cold
dark matter power spectrum, and model the growth of a Milky-Way sized halo with
microsolar mass resolution, corresponding to the typical Jeans mass for a dark
matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particle with mass of 100 GeV. We then
compute the \emph{unevolved} subhalo mass function and build-up a Milky-Way
halo placing and evolving its satellites. This subhalo population is used to
study the $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation. In this case,
the subhaloes which populate the host halo have been computed considering only
progenitor haloes accreted by the main branch of the tree, so as to correctly
treat the embedding of sub-subhaloes inside subhaloes. Each subhalo will indeed
host atthe present-time sub-subhaloes accreted when it was an isolated system.
In order to compute the sub-subhalo population of a Milky-Way dwarf galaxy,
like Draco, and to study its $\gamma$-ray emission, we first estimate the Draco
virial mass at merging redshift $z_m$ and then we run the merger tree from
$z_m$ following the halo down to the dark matter Jeans mass. We then study the
effect on the Fermi-LAT (GLAST) detectability for both subhaloes in the
Milky-Way and in Draco, and we show how subhaloes cannot be responsible for the
boost factor needed for detection.

switch between the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation direction. While the

a statistical-mechanical model of the flagellar rotary motor, which consists of
a number of stator proteins that drive the rotation of a ring of rotor
proteins, which in turn drives the rotation of a flagellar filament. At the
heart of our model is the assumption that the rotor protein complex can exist
in two conformational states corresponding to the two respective rotation
directions, and that switching between these states depends on interactions
with the stator proteins. This naturally couples the switching dynamics to the
rotation dynamics, making the switch sensitive to torque and speed. Another key
element of our model is that after a switching event, it takes time for the
load to build up, due to polymorphic transitions of the filament. Our model
predicts that this slow relaxation dynamics of the filament, in combination
with the load dependence of the switching frequency, leads to a characteristic
switching time, in agreement with recent observations.

sources of flavour-violation in addition to the usual Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing
matrix of the Standard Model. We reexamine the renormalisation group equations
(RGEs) with a view to investigating flavour effects in a supersymmetric theory
with an arbitrary flavour structure at some high scale. To incorporate
(two-loop sized) threshold effects in the one-loop RGEs, we calculate the
beta-functions using a sequence of (non-supersymmetric) effective theories with
heavy particles decoupled at the scale of their mass, keeping track of the fact
that many couplings (such as gauge and gaugino couplings) which are equal in an
exact supersymmetric theory may no longer be equal once the supersymmetry
(SUSY) is broken. We find that this splitting, which is ignored in the
literature, may be larger than two-loop terms that are included. In addition,
gaugino couplings develop flavour structure that is absent without including
decoupling effects. A program (to be incorporated into ISAJET) has been
developed, which includes flavour-violating couplings of superparticles and
solves the two-loop threshold RGEs subject to specified high scale inputs. The
weak scale flavour structure derived in this way can be applied to the study of
flavour-changing decays of SUSY particles. As an illustration, we revisit the
branching ratio of the flavour-violating decay of the top squark. We find that,
in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) class of models, previous estimates for
the width of this decay have been too large by a factor 10-25. We also analyse
the consequences of introducing non-universality in the high scale soft
SUSY-breaking mass matrices and find that under these conditions the partial
width can be altered by a large amount.

of the WD envelope, we investigate the sensitivity of the quiescent Teff to
long term variations in the accretion rate. We find that the quiescent Teff
provides one of the best available tests of predictions for the angular
momentum loss and resultant mass transfer rates which govern the evolution of
CVs. While gravitational radiation is sufficient to explain the <Mdot> of
strongly magnetic CVs at all Porb, faster angular momentum loss is required by
the temperatures of dwarf nova primaries (non-magnetic systems). This provides
evidence that a normal stellar magnetic field structure near the secondary is
essential for the enhanced braking mechanism to work, supporting the well-known
stellar wind braking hypothesis. The contrast in <Mdot> is most prominent for
orbital periods Porb > 3 hours, above the period gap, but a modest enhancement
is also present at shorter Porb. The averaging time which <Mdot> reflects is as
much as 10^5 years for low-<Mdot> systems and as little as 10^3 years for
high-<Mdot> systems. We discuss the security of conclusions drawn about the CV
population in light of these time scales and our necessarily incomplete sample
of systems. Measurements for non-magnetic systems above the period gap fall
below predictions from traditional stellar wind braking prescriptions, but
above more recent predictions with somewhat weaker angular momentum loss. We

rate, which were derived for spherical accretion by considering the same force
balance in the radial direction. If the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium

more serious as the value of the maximal possible accretion rate becomes
smaller. Previous understanding in the literature that global slim disk
solutions could stand for any large accretion rates is due to the
overestimation of the vertical gravitational force by using an approximate

$O(\min\{m, \frac{n^{2.5}\ln n}{d}\})$; this minimum can never be larger than
$O(n^{1.75}\sqrt{\ln n})$. We obtain this improvement by proving a uniform

graph has a perfect matching with high probability. The proof involves a
decomposition of the graph into pieces which are guaranteed to have many
perfect matchings but do not have any small cuts. We then establish a
correspondence between potential witnesses to non-existence of a matching
(after sampling) in any piece and cuts of comparable size in that same piece.
Karger's sampling theorem for preserving cuts in a graph can now be adapted to
prove our uniform sampling theorem for preserving perfect matchings. Using the
$O(m\sqrt{n})$ algorithm (due to Hopcroft and Karp) for finding maximum
matchings in bipartite graphs on the sampled graph then yields the stated
running time. We also provide an infinite family of instances to show that our
uniform sampling result is tight up to poly-logarithmic factors (in fact, up to
$\ln^2 n$).

is revisited using several cases of a Navier-Stokes'-level constitutive model
in which we incorporate the global equation of states for pressure and thermal
conductivity (which are accurate up-to the maximum packing density $\nu_{m}$)
and the shear viscosity is allowed to diverge at a density $\nu_\mu$ ($<
\nu_{m}$), with all other transport coefficients diverging at $\nu_{m}$. It is
shown that the emergence of shear-banding instabilities (for perturbations
having no variation along the streamwise direction), that lead to shear-band
formation along the gradient direction, depends crucially on the choice of the
constitutive model. In the framework of a dense constitutive model that
incorporates only collisional transport mechanism, it is shown that an accurate
global equation of state for pressure or a viscosity divergence at a lower
density or a stronger viscosity divergence (with other transport coefficients
being given by respective Enskog values that diverge at $\nu_m$) can induce
shear-banding instabilities, even though the original dense Enskog model is
stable to such shear-banding instabilities. For any constitutive model, the
onset of this shear-banding instability is tied to a {\it universal} criterion
in terms of constitutive relations for viscosity and pressure, and the sheared
granular flow evolves toward a state of lower ""dynamic"" friction, leading to
the shear-induced band formation, as it cannot sustain increasing dynamic
friction with increasing density to stay in the homogeneous state. A similar
criterion of a lower viscosity or a lower viscous-dissipation is responsible
for the shear-banding state in many complex fluids.

significant impacts to people is the risk of contacting SARS while engaging
daily routine activity. In this work we use data from daily underground
ridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the
dynamics of the public underground usage during the wax and wane of the SARS
period. We found that for each reported SARS case there is an immediate loss of
about 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagate to the following
days with an e-folding decay time of about 28 days, reflecting the public
perception on the risk of contacting SARS disease when travelling with the
underground system. About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of
the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the
closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70%
ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during
typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year

at least as important as cold gas accretion. For more than a decade, the source
of the bright H-alpha emission (up to 750 mR) along the Magellanic Stream has
remained a mystery. We present a hydrodynamical model that explains the known
properties of the H-alpha emission and provides new insights on the lifetime of
the Stream clouds. The upstream clouds are gradually disrupted due to their
interaction with the hot halo gas. The clouds that follow plough into gas
ablated from the upstream clouds, leading to shock ionisation at the leading
edges of the downstream clouds. Since the following clouds also experience
ablation, and weaker H-alpha (100-200 mR) is quite extensive, a disruptive
cascade must be operating along much of the Stream. In order to light up much
of the Stream as observed, it must have a small angle of attack (~20 deg) to
the halo, and this may already find support in new HI observations. Another
prediction is that the Balmer ratio will be substantially enhanced due to the
slow shock. We find that the clouds are evolving on timescales of 100-200 Myr,
such that the Stream must be replenished by the Magellanic Clouds at a fairly
constant rate (>0.1 Msun/yr). The ablated material falls onto the Galaxy as a
warm drizzle; diffuse ionized gas at 10^4 K is an important constituent of
galactic accretion. We consider the stability of HI clouds falling towards the
Galactic disk and show that most of these must break down into smaller
fragments that become partially ionized. The Galactic halo is expected to have
huge numbers of smaller neutral and ionized fragments. When the ionized
component is accounted for, the rate of gas accretion is ~0.4 Msun/yr, roughly
twice the rate deduced from HI observations alone.

young M- and L-dwarfs. This enables empirical comparisons with old M- and L-
dwarfs, and detailed studies in comparison with synthetic spectra. While
classical stellar atmosphere physics seems perfectly appropriate for old
M-dwarfs, more physical and chemical processes, cloud formation in particular,
needs to be modelled in the substellar regime to allow a detailed spectral
interpretation.
  Not much is known so far about the details of the inset of cloud formation at
the spectral transition region between M and L dwarfs. Furthermore there is
observational evidence for diversity in the dust properties of objects having
the same spectral type. Do we understand these differences? The question is
also how young M- and L-dwarfs need to be classified, which stellar parameter
do they have and whether degenerations in the stellar parameter space due to
the changing atmosphere physics are present, like in the L-T transition region.
  The Splinter was driven by these questions which we will use to encourage
interactions between observation and theory. Given the recent advances, both in
observations and spectral modelling, an intensive discussion between observers
and theoreticians will create new synergies in our field.

The scientific interest lies in the fact that super-Earths share common
geophysical attributes with Earths. They already begin to be detected by radial
velocity (RV) and, together with giant planets, they have a larger area than
Earths, making them detectable with a 1.5-2 m class telescope in reflected

synchrotron radiation of ultra-relativistic particles in turbulent magnetic
fields. We address the effect of a random magnetic field on synchrotron
emission images and spectra. A random magnetic field is simulated to construct
synchrotron emission maps of a source with a steady distribution of
ultra-relativistic electrons. Non-steady localized structures (dots, clumps and
filaments), in which the magnetic field reaches exceptionally high values,
typically arise in the random field sample. These magnetic field concentrations
dominate the synchrotron emission (integrated along the line of sight) from the
highest energy electrons in the cut-off regime of the distribution, resulting
in an evolving, intermittent, clumpy appearance. The simulated structures
resemble those observed in X-ray images of some young supernova remnants. The
lifetime of X-ray clumps can be short enough to be consistent with that
observed even in the case of a steady particle distribution. The efficiency of
synchrotron radiation from the cut-off regime in the electron spectrum is
strongly enhanced in a turbulent field compared to emission from a uniform
field of the same magnitude.
