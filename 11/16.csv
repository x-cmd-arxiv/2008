between crystals prepared with different doping levels. Superconductivity is
observed for a further range of Co concentrations, before being completely
suppressed for $x \sim 0.018$ and above. The form of this $x-T$ phase diagram

the calculation of the stellar 7Li abundance is the effective temperature,
Teff. We use sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs to calculate new Teff values using
the excitation energy method. With this temperature scale we then calculate new
Li abundances for this group of stars in an attempt to resolve the 7Li
discrepancy. Using high signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 100) spectra of 16 metal-poor
halo dwarfs, obtained with the UCLES spectrograph on the AAT, measurements of
equivalent widths from a set of unblended FeI lines are made. These equivalent
widths are then used to calculate new Teff values with the use of the single
line radiative transfer program WIDTH6, where we have constrained the gravity
using either theoretical isochrones or the Hipparcos parallax, rather than the
ionization balance. The lithium abundances of the stars are calculated with
these temperatures. The physical parameters are derived for the 16 programme
stars, and two standards. These include Teff, log g, [Fe/H], microturbulence
and 7Li abundances. A comparison between the temperature scale of this work and
those adopted by others has been undertaken. We find good consistency with the

essential approximations: 1. The SNR was defined in terms of total
after-projection signal and noise powers, and the BER was analyzed based on
their ratio. This corresponds to a non-coherent (power-wise) equal-gain
combining of both the signal and the noise, and it is not optimum since it does
not provide the maximum output SNR. 2. The definition of the total
after-projection noise power at each step ignored the fact that the
after-projection noise vector had correlated components. 3. The after-combining
noises at different steps (and hence the errors) were implicitly assumed to be
independent of each other. Under non-coherent equal-gain combining, that is not
the case. It turns out that the results in [1] hold also true without these
approximations, subject to minor modifications only. The purpose of this note
is to show this and also to extend the average BER results in [1] to the case
of BPSK-modulated V-BLAST with more than two Rx antennas (eq. 18-20).
Additionally, we emphasize that the block error rate is dominated by the first
step BER at the high-SNR mode (eq. 14 and 21).

elements transfer from the one system to another. This is relevant for various
processes of partial state transfer (quantum communication, indirect
measurement, polarization transfer, {\it etc}). Given two systems A and B with
initial density operators $\lambda$ and $r$, respectively, we consider most
general interactions, which lead to transferring certain matrix elements of
unknown $\lambda$ into those of the final state ${\widetilde r}$ of B. We find
that this process leads to eliminating the memory on the transferred (or
certain other) matrix elements from the final state of A. If one diagonal
matrix element is transferred: ${\widetilde r}_{aa}=\lambda_{aa}$, the memory
on each non-diagonal element $\lambda_{a\not=b}$ is completely eliminated from
the final density operator of A. The transfer of a non-diagonal element:
${\widetilde r}_{ab}=\lambda_{ab}$ eliminates the memory on the diagonal
elements $\lambda_{aa}$ and $\lambda_{bb}$, while the memory about their sum
$\lambda_{aa}+\lambda_{bb}$ is kept. Moreover, the memory about $\lambda_{ab}$
itself is completely eliminated from the final state of A. Generalization of
these set-ups to non-ideal transfer brings in a trade-off between the quality
of the transfer and the amount of preserved memory. This trade-off is expressed
via system-independent uncertainty relations.

with short-range interaction and in presence of an IID external potential with
sufficiently regular marginal cumulative distribution function (CDF). Our main
method is an adaptation of the multi-scale analysis (MSA; cf. \cite{FS},
\cite{FMSS}, \cite{DK}) to multi-particle systems, in combination with an
induction on the number of particles, as was proposed in our earlier manuscript
\cite{CS07}. Similar results have been recently obtained in an independent work
by Aizenman and Warzel \cite{AW08}: they proposed an extension of the
Fractional-Moment Method (FMM) developed earlier for single-particle models in

combined with an induction on the number of particles.
  An important role in our proof is played by a variant of Stollmann's
eigenvalue concentration bound (cf. \cite{St00}). This result, as was proved
earlier in \cite{C08}, admits a straightforward extension covering the case of
multi-particle systems with correlated external random potentials: a subject of
our future work. We also stress that the scheme of our proof is \textit{not}

neural network based agents that invent ideas for actions, and imitate

which what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal
models of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a
Darwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving
exchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of
actions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of
actions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and
density, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase
fitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by
sharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions
throughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces
diversity of actions. Increasing the number of leaders reduces this effect.
Efforts are underway to simulate the conditions under which an agent

(Cananea, Mexico), a study of the spectral properties of the complete sample of

recalibrated by means of photometric magnitudes in the
Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut system, which includes fluxes in 11 bands

complementary approaches that rely on a comparison of the spectra with (i) an
empirical sample of stars with well-established spectral types and (ii) a
theoretical grid of optical spectra computed at both low and high resolution.
The overall results indicate that the BSs in M67 span a wide range in Teff(~

expected for main-sequence objects (log g = 3.5 -5.0 dex).

two major modeling systems that have been built by us over the last 10 years.
It is a long and arduous process but the reward of understanding can be
enormous, as demonstrated in the examples shown in this work. We found that
long-range transport of emerging Asian pollutants can be interpreted using a
Lagrangian framework for wind analysis. More detailed processes still need to
be modeled but an accurate representation of the wind structure is the most
important thing above all others. Our long-term chemistry integrations reveal
the capability of the IMS model in simulating tropospheric chemistry on a
climate scale. These long-term integrations also show ways for further model
development. Modeling is a quantitative process, and the understanding can be
sustained only when theories are vigorously tested in the models and compared
with high quality measurements. We should also not over look the importance of
data visualization techniques. Humans feel more confident when they see things.
Hence, modeling is an incredible journey, combining data collection,
theoretical formulation, detailed computer coding and harnessing computer
power. The best is yet to come.

the instability is a natural way to build nonspherical systems and thus can be
considered as a new technique for constructing equilibrium $N$-body models.
Methods. The dynamical evolution of the models was followed numerically by
means of the Dehnen's public code gyrfacON. Results. We found that the shape of
the density profiles for various initial spherical models didn't change despite
of the systems were drastically rearranged into triaxial configurations and had
got the new scale lengths. The cusp was found to be an invariant feature of
such a rearranging. Starting from a certain unstable spherical $\gamma$-model
we obtain a triaxial system with the same cusp. The end-products are
anisotropic at large radii and have anisotropy profiles of the Osipkov-Merrit
type. The size of the isotropic core once rescaled corresponds to the value of
marginally stable $\gamma$-progenitors and is almost independent of the
unstable starting point. Conclusions. We conclude that the end-products reach a
new steady state and have quite predictable properties. They can be used as
equilibrium models to describe the elliptical galaxies and bulges. They also
can be incorporated in $N$-body simulations deal with multicomponent systems.

covering spaces, or equivalently local systems. When the space is topologically
stratified Treumann, based on unpublished ideas of MacPherson, constructed an
`exit category' (in the terminology of this paper, the `fundamental category')
which classifies constructible sheaves, equivalently stratified etale covers.
This paper generalises this construction to homotopically stratified sets, in
addition showing that the fundamental category dually classifies constructible
cosheaves, equivalently stratified branched covers.
  The more general setting has several advantages. It allows us to remove a
technical `tameness' condition which appears in Treumann's work; to show that
the fundamental groupoid can be recovered by inverting all morphisms and,
perhaps most importantly, to reduce computations to the two stratum case. This
provides an approach to computing the fundamental category in terms of homotopy
groups of strata and homotopy links. We apply these techniques to compute the
fundamental category of symmetric products of R^2, stratified by collisions.
  Two appendices explain the close relations respectively between filtered and
pre-ordered spaces and between cosheaves and branched covers (technically
locally-connected uniquely-complete spreads).

that the coset space $G/H$ can be equipped with the structure of a manifold
homogeneous under $G$ and that any $G$-homogeneous manifold is isomorphic to
one of this kind. An interesting problem is to find an analogue of this result
in the case of supermanifolds.
  In the classical setting, $G$ is a real or a complex Lie group and $G/H$ is a
real and, respectively, a complex manifold. Now, if $G$ is a real Lie
supergroup and $H\subset G$ is a closed Lie subsupergroup, there is a natural
way to consider $G/H$ as a supermanfold. Furthermore, any $G$-homogeneous real
supermanifold can be obtained in this way, see \cite{Kostant}. The goal of this
paper is to give a proof of this result in the complex case.
