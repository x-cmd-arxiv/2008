composition problem. New determinations of solar metal abundances lead SSM
calculations to conflict with helioseismological measurements, showing
discrepancies that extend from the convection zone to the solar core and can
not be easily assigned to deficiencies in the modelling of the solar convection
zone. We present updated solar neutrino fluxes and uncertainties for two SSM
with high (old) and low (new) solar metallicity determinations. The
uncertainties in iron and carbon abundances are the largest contribution to the
uncertainties of the solar neutrino fluxes. The uncertainty on the ^14N+p ->
^15O+g rate is the largest of the non-composition uncertainties to the CNO
neutrino fluxes. We propose an independent method to help identify which SSM is
the correct one. Present neutrino data can not distinguish the solar neutrino
predictions of both models but ongoing measurements can help to solve the
puzzle.

Bose-Einstein condensate past an obstacle is studied. We consider the general
case of unequal velocities of two superfluid components. The Landau criterium
applied to the two-component system determines a certain region in the velocity
space in which superfluidity may take place. Stationary waves arise out of this
region, but under the additional condition that the relative velocity of the
components does not exceed some critical value. Under increase of the relative
velocity the spectrum of the excitations becomes complex valued and the
stationary wave pattern is broken. In case of equal velocities two sets of
stationary waves that correspond to the lower and the upper Bogolyubov mode can
arise. If one component flows and the other is at rest only one set of waves
may emerge. Two or even three interfere sets of waves may arise if the
velocities approximately of equal value and the angle between the velocities is
close to pi/2. In two latter cases the stationary waves correspond to the lower
mode and the densities of the components oscillate out-of-phase. The ratio of
amplitudes of the components in the stationary waves is computed. This quantity
depends on the relative velocity, is different for different sets of waves, and
varies along the crests of the waves. For the cases where two or three waves
interfere the density images are obtained.

Specifically, the probable pairing symmetry, the doping dependence of the
transition temperature and the pairing mechanism are studied by solving the
Eliashberg equation for multi-band (2- and 5-band) Hubbard models with
realistic electronic structures. The effective pairing interaction is expanded
perturbatively in the on-site Coulomb integrals up to third order. Our
perturbative weak-coupling approach shows that sufficiently large eigenvalues
of the Eliashberg equation are obtained to explain the actual high transition
temperatures by taking realistic on-site Coulomb integrals in the 5-band model.
Thus, unconventional (non-phonon-mediated) superconductivity is highly likely
to be realized. The superconducting order parameter does not change its sign on
the Fermi surfaces, but it does change between the electron and hole Fermi
surfaces. Consequently, the probable pairing symmetry is always ""a nodeless
extended s-wave symmetry (more specifically, an s_{+-}-wave symmetry)"" over the
whole parameter region that we investigated. It is suggested that the 2-band
model is insufficient to explain the high values of Tc.

turbulent electromotive force, is described by a combination of the alpha
effect and turbulent magnetic diffusion, which are usually assumed to be
proportional respectively to the mean field and its spatial derivatives. For a
passive scalar there is just turbulent diffusion, where the mean flux of
concentration depends on the gradient of the mean concentration. However, these
proportionalities are approximations that are valid only if the mean field or
the mean concentration vary slowly in time. Examples are presented where
turbulent transport possesses memory, i.e. where it depends crucially on the
past history of the mean field. Such effects are captured by replacing
turbulent transport coefficients with time integral kernels, resulting in
transport coefficients that depend effectively on the frequency or the growth
rate of the mean field itself. In this paper we perform numerical experiments
to find the characteristic timescale (or memory length) of this effect as well
as simple analytical models of the integral kernels in the case of passive
scalar concentrations and kinematic dynamos. The integral kernels can then be
used to find self-consistent growth or decay rates of the mean fields. In

  Problem","Typos removed. An argument about sequential compactness replaced by
  one based on Tikhonov-Schauder theorem",,,,"math.DS math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been observed that the famous Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser period
doubling universality has a counterpart for area-preserving maps of
$\field{R}^2$. A renormalization approach has been used in a computer-assisted
proof of existence of an area-preserving map with orbits of all binary periods
by J.-P. Eckmann, H. Koch and P. Wittwer (1982 and 1984). As it is the case
with all non-trivial universality problems in non-dissipative systems in
dimensions more than one, no analytic proof of this period doubling
universality exists to date.
  We argue that the period doubling renormalization fixed point for
area-preserving maps is almost one dimensional, in the sense that it is close
to the following Henon-like map: $$H^*(x,u)=(\phi(x)-u,x-\phi(\phi(x)-u)),$$
where $\phi$ solves $$\phi(x)={2 \over \lambda} \phi(\phi(\lambda x))-x.$$
  We then give a ``proof'' of existence of solutions of small analytic
perturbations of this one dimensional problem, and describe some of the
properties of this solution.
  The ``proof'' consists of an analytic argument for factorized inverse
branches of $\phi$ together with verification of several inequalities and
inclusions of subsets of $\field{C}$ numerically.
  Finally, we suggest an analytic approach to the full period doubling problem
for area-preserving maps based on its proximity to the one dimensional. In this
respect, the paper is an exploration of a possible analytic machinery for a
non-trivial renormalization problem in a conservative two-dimensional system.

mean convergence to the optimum function value for diminishing stepsizes. When
the mean errors diminish sufficiently fast, we strengthen the results to
consensus and convergence of the iterates to an optimal solution with

empirical form. The above vacuum level surface electron band structure for this
surface has not been calculated before and it is important in understanding
many surface phenomena. The geometric structure of the Al(111) surface is known
from intensity analysis in low-energy electron diffraction at energies 60 --
450 eV. The details of the surface barrier for Al(111) were obtained from a
match with the below vacuum level experimental energy position of the first
Rydberg surface resonance and the Shockley surface state at k_|| = 0
(Gamma-bar). The calculation was then extended to the above vacuum level case
for 0 -- 27 eV with the inclusion of inelastic electron interactions. Tamm-type
resonances at 6.9 eV and possibly also at 8.3 eV, a Shockley-type resonance at
14.0\pm0.5 eV and a series of Rydberg (image) resonances near 24 eV all above
vacuum level are found at k_|| = 0. The same 2D layer Green function scattering
method using the same input data was then used to calculate the intensity of
the 00 beam for k_|| = 0 (normal incidence) in very low energy electron
diffraction (VLEED) from this surface in the energy range 0 -- 65 eV. Features
in the VLEED intensities are found due to the Shockley and Rydberg resonances.
Experimental data from over 26 years ago found surface features near the
energies found in this work. Beam intensities from low energy electron
microscope (LEEM) measurements at normal incidence and new data from other
surface spectroscopies could provide experimental confirmation of the

vectors using highly unreliable disjunctive measurements. We consider an
adversarial noise model that only limits the number of false observations, and
show that any noise-resilient scheme in this model can only approximately
reconstruct the sparse vector. On the positive side, we take this barrier to
our advantage and show that approximate reconstruction (within a satisfactory
degree of approximation) allows us to break the information theoretic lower
bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^2 \log n)$ that is known for exact reconstruction of
$d$-sparse vectors of length $n$ via non-adaptive measurements, by a
multiplicative factor $\tilde{\Omega}(d)$.
  Specifically, we give simple randomized constructions of non-adaptive
measurement schemes, with $m=O(d \log n)$ measurements, that allow efficient
reconstruction of $d$-sparse vectors up to $O(d)$ false positives even in the
presence of $\delta m$ false positives and $O(m/d)$ false negatives within the
measurement outcomes, for any constant $\delta < 1$. We show that, information
theoretically, none of these parameters can be substantially improved without
dramatically affecting the others. Furthermore, we obtain several explicit
constructions, in particular one matching the randomized trade-off but using $m
= O(d^{1+o(1)} \log n)$ measurements. We also obtain explicit constructions
that allow fast reconstruction in time $\poly(m)$, which would be sublinear in
$n$ for sufficiently sparse vectors. The main tool used in our construction is
the list-decoding view of randomness condensers and extractors.

some simple models of structure formation studied in the literature seem to

it has also been suggested that the standard perturbed FLRW framework is no
longer a good approximation during structure formation, when the density
contrast becomes nonlinear. In this work we use Zalaletdinov's covariant
averaging scheme (macroscopic gravity or MG) to show that as long as the metric
of the Universe can be described by the perturbed FLRW form, the corrections
due to averaging remain negligibly small. Further, using a fully relativistic
and reasonably generic model of pressureless spherical collapse, we show that
as long as matter velocities remain small (which is true in our model), the
perturbed FLRW form of the metric can be explicitly recovered. Together, these
results imply that the backreaction remains small even during nonlinear
structure formation, and we confirm this within the toy model with a numerical
calculation.

constraints on most cosmological parameters by a factor 3-4 and on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r by a factor 9. Also inflationary parameters, like r,
n_s and n_run, are no longer degenerate. The tensor spectral index, however, is
little constrained. A combination of the 70 to 143 GHz channels will contain
~90% of all possible information, with 143 GHz polarisation information
carrying about half of the constraining power on r. Also, the error on r
degrades by a factor 2 if no B modes are included in the analysis. High-l
temperature information is essential for determination of n_s and \Omega_b,
while improving noise properties increase the l-range where Planck would be
cosmic variance limited in polarisation, with a significant improvement on the
determination of r, \tau and A_s. However, a sub-percent difference in the FWHM
used in the data analysis with respect to the one in the map will result in a
bias for several parameters. Finally, Planck will greatly help future missions
like LSST and CIP reach their potentials by providing tight constraints on
parameters like n_s and n_run. Considering Planck together with these probes
will help in breaking degeneracies between \Omega_K and \Omega_\Lambda or
\Omega_dm and f_\nu, resulting in improvements of several factors in the error

slave-fermion approach of the t-J model, where antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations and doped holes are described by bosonic spinons and fermionic
holons, respectively. Earlier studies have shown that an effective field theory
for the doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is given by a non-relativistic
fermion (holon) U(1) gauge theory for charge dynamics and a relativistic boson
(spinon) U(1) gauge theory for spin dynamics, thus allowing an anomalous
metallic phase where bosonic spinons are gapped away from an antiferromagnetic
state, analogous to the U(1) spin liquid phase in the slave-boson approach of
the t-J model. We argue that the emergent U(1) gauge structure in this approach
is based on a simplified picture for antiferromagnetic correlations.
Considering that dynamics of doped holes frustrates a collinear
antiferromagnetic spin configuration, we show that doped holes enhance
ferromagnetic spin correlations and result in a complex magnetic structure. The
presence of such a complex spin texture reduces the U(1) gauge structure down
to Z$_{2}$, thus a different effective field theory results for the spin-gapped
non-Fermi liquid metal at low temperatures because there are no gapless U(1)
gauge fluctuations.

implementations of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 coding: prepare-and-measure
implementations without decoy states, and entanglement-based implementations. A
finite-key bound for prepare-and-measure implementations with decoy states is
also derived under a simplified treatment of the statistical fluctuations. The

using the appropriate limits of the ionization energy theory and the quantum
adiabatic theorem. When the phonons in the quantum dots are isolated
adiabatically from the phonons in the substrate, the elastic or pure dephasing
becomes the dominant mechanism. On the other hand, for the case where the
phonons from the substrate are non-adiabatically coupled to the quantum dots,
the inelastic dephasing process takes over. This switch-over is due to
different elemental composition in quantum dots as compared to its substrate.
We also provide unambiguous analyses as to understand why GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dots may only have pure dephasing while InAs/GaAs quantum dots give rise to the
inelastic dephasing as the dominant mechanism. Our study accentuates the

(SNe Ia). Likewise, it is not agreed how single white dwarfs with masses less
than ~0.5 Msun can be formed in the field, even though they are known to exist.
We consider whether single low-mass white dwarfs (LMWDs) could have been formed
in binary systems where their companions have exploded as a SN Ia. In this
model, the observed single LMWDs are the remnants of giant-branch donor stars
whose envelopes have been stripped off by the supernova explosion. We
investigate the likely remnants of SNe Ia, including the effects of the
explosion on the envelope of the donor star. We also use evolutionary arguments
to examine alternative formation channels for single LMWDs. In addition, we
calculate the expected kinematics of the potential remnants of SNe Ia. SN Ia in
systems with giant-branch donor stars can naturally explain the production of
single LMWDs. It seems difficult for any other formation mechanism to account
for the observations, especially for those single LMWDs with masses less than
~0.4 Msun. Independent of those results, we find that the kinematics of one
potentially useful population containing single LMWDs is consistent with our
model. Studying remnant white-dwarf kinematics seems to be a promising way to
investigate SN Ia progenitors. The existence of single LMWDs appears to
constitute evidence for the production of SNe Ia in binary systems with a
red-giant donor star. Other single white dwarfs with higher space velocities
support a second, probably dominant, population of SN Ia progenitors which
contained main-sequence or subgiant donor stars at the time of explosion. The
runaway stars LP400-22 and US 708 suggest the possibility of a third formation
channnel for some SNe Ia in systems where the donor stars are hot subdwarfs.

theory is reviewed with focus in analyzing the non--integrability of various

Morales--Ramis theorem, the algebrization method of Acosta--Bl\'azquez and
Kovacic's algorithm. Morales--Ramis states that if Hamiltonian system has an
additional meromorphic integral in involution in a neighborhood of a specific
solution, then the differential Galois group of the normal variational
equations is abelian. The algebrization method permits under general conditions
to recast the variational equation in a form suitable for its analysis by means
of Kovacic's algorithm. We apply these tools to various examples of few body
problems in Celestial Mechanics: (a) the elliptic restricted three body in the
plane with collision of the primaries; (b) a general Hamiltonian system of two
degrees of freedom with homogeneous potential of degree -1; here we perform
McGehee's blow up and obtain the normal variational equation in the form of an
hypergeometric equation. We recover Yoshida's criterion for non--integrability.
Then we contrast two methods to compute the Galois group: the well known, based
in the Schwartz--Kimura table, and the lesser based in Kovacic's algorithm. We
apply these methodology to three problems: the rectangular four body problem,
the anisotropic Kepler problem and two uncoupled Kepler problems in the line;
the last two depend on a mass parameter, but while in the anisotropic problem
it is integrable for only two values of the parameter, the two uncoupled Kepler
problems is completely integrable for all values of the masses.

estimate the baryonic mass in the outskirts of galaxy clusters which is
difficult to observe because of low electron temperature and density in these

the outskirts is longer than the cluster age. Since thermal equilibrium is not
achieved, a significant fraction of the ICM baryons may be hidden in shells

for the concealment of missing baryons in an outer baryon shell and show that
this condition is fulfilled because cluster masses are comparable to the

of a Kondo spin chain induces a fast and long lived oscillatory dynamics. This
quickly establishes a high quality entanglement between the spins at the
opposite ends of the chain. This entanglement is mediated by the Kondo Cloud,
attains a constant high value independent of the length for large chains, and
shows thermal robustness. In contrast, when the Kondo cloud is absent, e.g. in
the gapped dimer regime, only finite size end to end effects can create some
entanglement on a much longer time-scale for rather short chains. By decoupling
one end of the chain during the dynamics one can distinguish between this
end-end effect which vanishes, and the global Kondo cloud mediated
entanglement, which persists. This quench approach paves the way to detect the
elusive Kondo cloud through the entanglement between two individual spins. Our
results show that non-perturbative cooperative phenomena from condensed matter
may be exploited for quantum information.

reveals several substructures that we describe. We also analyse the
distribution of the brightest blue galaxies across a major fraction of the
cluster volume, considering if they are gas-rich or poor. We report a very
asymmetric distribution of the blue member galaxies, and connect it with
substructures revealed in the optical and X-rays. By matching our sample of
bright blue member galaxies with HI detections reported in the literature, we
identify gas-rich and gas-poor ones. HI-rich blue galaxies also turn out to be
asymmetrically distributed, with most of them projected on the eastern side of
the cluster. No blue objects have been detected in HI up to a projected radius

because the framework is the first to provide quantitative evidence for several
important conjectures about distributed computation in cellular automata: that
blinkers embody information storage, particles are information transfer agents,

also shown to contrast the computations conducted by several well-known

edge structure of the armchair/zigzag/armchair type. It is shown that the
finite zigzag region supports edge bound states with discrete equidistant
spectrum obtained from the Green's function of the continuum Dirac equation.
The energy levels exhibit the coupling between the valley degree of freedom and
the orbital quantum number, analogous to a spin-orbit interaction. The
characteristic feature of the spectrum is the presence of a zero mode, the
bound state of vanishing energy. It resides only in one of the graphene
valleys, breaking spontaneously Kramers' symmetry of the edge states. This
implies the spontaneous valley polarization characterized by the valley isospin
$\pm 1/2$. The polarization is manifested by a zero-magnetic field anomaly in
the local tunneling density of states, and is directly related to the local
electric Hall conductivity.

Assuming universal boundary conditions at a high energy scale for the soft

trilinear interactions, we find that the model can satisfy all present
constraints from colliders and cosmological data on dark matter, B- and

the cNMSSM can be described by essentially one single parameter as the

the universal scalar mass m_0. The lightest supersymmetric particle is always a
singlino-like neutralino that is almost degenerate with the lightest tau
slepton. We study the particle spectrum of the model and its signatures at the

surface detail could be discerned. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries
telescopes improved, revealing many dark areas on the red tinted surface. After
the close opposition of 1877 Giovanni Schiaparelli announced about 40 canali on
Mars. This led to the saga of the canals of Mars, laid to rest in 1971 when
Mariner 9 made observations from Martian orbit showing that the canali/canals
of Mars do not exist. Belief that there was life on Mars was widespread in the
19th century, including the view that the dark areas were some form of plant
life. This view persisted until Mariner 4 flew past Mars in 1965 and discovered
a far thinner atmosphere than previously thought, with impact craters
dominating the images. It was Mariner 9 that revealed much more promising
landscapes. Thus, the contemporary era of Mars exploration began. Our picture
of Mars today is not only much more complete that that before Mariner 4, in
several ways it is quite different. The belief however, that there may be life
on Mars persists - subsurface life cannot be ruled out and, failing that, there
might be ancient fossils on Mars.

spontaneously from an ergodic state to a non ergodic state in a time varying
from hours to months depending on Laponite concentration. When a polymer

adsorbs on clay particle surfaces modifying the effective interaction potential
between Laponite particles. A dynamic light scattering study, varying polymer
concentration at fixed polymer molecular weight (Mw=200.000 g/mol), has been
performed in order to understand the effect of polymer on the aging dynamics of
the system. The results obtained show that arresting phenomena between clay
particles are hindered if PEO is added and consequently the aging dynamics
slows down with increasing PEO concentration. This process is possibly due to
the progressive coverage of the clay surface by polymers that grow with
increasing PEO concentration and may lead to steric stabilization.

Cancer progression is explored by applying a Monte Carlo method to simulate the
stochastic behavior of cell reproduction and death in a population of blood
cells which can experience genetic mutations. In CML front line therapy is
represented by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib which strongly affects
the reproduction of leukemic cells only. In this work, we analyze the effects
of a targeted therapy on the evolutionary dynamics of normal, first-mutant and
cancerous cell populations. Several scenarios of the evolutionary dynamics of
imatinib-treated leukemic cells are described as a consequence of the efficacy
of the different modeled therapies. We show how the patient response to the
therapy changes when an high value of the mutation rate from healthy to

observations. Unfortunately, development of resistance to imatinib is observed
in a proportion of patients, whose blood cells are characterized by an
increasing number of genetic alterations. We find that the occurrence of

(i) a vector model, where interactions are proportional to the overlap between

between states. In both cases the system displays three phases: two ordered
phases, one parallel to the field, and another orthogonal to the field; and a
disordered phase. The phase space is numerically characterized for each model

using the generator coordinate method within the relativistic mean-field (RMF)
theory. Employing the Lagrangian models of the nonlinear-$\sigma$ model
(NL$\sigma$), the scalar-vector interaction model (SVI) and the
$\sigma$-$\omega$ coupling model (SIGO), we show that each Lagrangian model
exhibits a distinctly different GMR response. Consequently, Lagrangian models
yield a different value of the GMR energy for a given value of the nuclear
matter incompressibility $K_\infty$. It is shown that this effect arises
largely from a different value of the surface incompressibility $K_{surf}$
inherent to each Lagrangian model, thus giving rise to the ratio
$K_{surf}/K_\infty$ which depends upon the Lagrangian model used. This is
attributed to a difference in the density dependence of the meson masses and
hence to the density dependence of the nuclear interaction amongst various
Lagrangian models. The sensitivity of the GMR energy to the Lagrangian model
used and thus emergence of a multitude of GMR energies for a given value of
$K_\infty$ renders the method of extracting $K_\infty$ on the basis of
interpolation amongst forces as inappropriate. As a remedy, the need to
'calibrate' the density dependence of the nuclear interaction in the RMF theory
is proposed.

confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and other non-perturbative effects have
been developed. However, if both views are correct then they can only be
different aspects of the same underlying physics, and it must be possible to
relate them.
  After discussing the current status of the understanding of this connection,
smeared and cooled configurations in lattice gauge theory are used to determine
the properties of Green's functions in the low-momentum regime. It is found
that the qualitative properties are essentially unchanged compared to results
