understand how to fix D7-brane positions by the choice of fluxes. More
generally, F-theory model building requires the understanding of how fluxes
determine the singularity structure (and hence gauge group and matter content)
of the compactification. We analyse this problem in the simple setting of
M-theory on K3xK3. Given a certain flux which is consistent with the F-theory
limit, we can explicitly derive the positions at which D7 branes or stacks of
D7 branes are stabilised. The analysis is based on a parameterization of the
moduli space of type IIB string theory on T^2/Z_2 (including D7-brane
positions) in terms of the periods of integral cycles of M-theory on K3. This
allows us, in particular, to select a specific desired gauge group by the
choice of flux numbers.

potentially promising avenue for engineering GUT models which descend to the

related to phase rotations of the internal holomorphic coordinates at the brane
intersection point leads to rank one Yukawa matrices. Subleading corrections to
the internal wave functions from variations in the background fluxes generate
small violations of this U(1), leading to hierarchical Yukawa structures
reminiscent of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. The expansion parameter for this
perturbation is in terms of alpha_(GUT)^(1/2). Moreover, we naturally obtain a
hierarchical CKM matrix with V_(12) ~ V_(21) ~ epsilon, V_(23) ~ V_(32) ~

(Haar distributed) orthogonal matrix $\Gamma$, and use it to ""rotate"" the north

x_0$ that is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. Now use the same
orthogonal matrix to transform u, giving $v=\Gamma u=\Gamma^2 x_0$. Simulations
reported in Marzetta et al (2002) suggest that v is more likely to be in the
northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, and, morever, that
$w=\Gamma^3 x_0$ has higher probability of being closer to the poles $\pm x_0$
than the uniformly distributed point u. In this paper we prove these results,
in the general setting of dimension $p\ge 3$, by deriving the exact
distributions of the relevant components of u and v. The essential questions
answered are the following. Let x be any fixed point on the unit sphere in
$R^p$, where $p\ge 3$. What are the distributions of $U_2=x'\Gamma^2 x$ and
$U_3=x'\Gamma^3 x$? It is clear by orthogonal invariance that these
distribution do not depend on x, so that we can, without loss of generality,
take x to be $x_0=(1,0,...,0)'\in R^p$. Call this the ""north pole"". Then
$x_0'\Gamma^ k x_0$ is the first component of the vector $\Gamma^k x_0$. We
derive stochastic representations for the exact distributions of $U_2$ and
$U_3$ in terms of random variables with known distributions.

show a crossover from low- to high temperature regime at T \sim M_\mu. For
\rho_in>\rho_out or \chi_in>\chi_out finite-temperature properties are
universal functions only at sufficiently large M_\mu. The high-energy behaviour
in the latter regime is similar to the Landau-pole dependence of the physical

enrichment of the intergalactic medium both suggest that mass loss from
galaxies is a significant factor for the chemical evolution history of
galaxies, in particular of dwarf galaxies. However, no clear evidence of a
blow-away in local dwarf galaxies has been found so far.
  Aims. We therefore performed a detailed kinematic analysis of the neutral and
ionised gas in the nearby star-forming irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 2366 in order
to make predictions about the fate of the gas and to get a more complete
picture of this galaxy.
  Methods. A deep Halpha image and Fabry-Perot interferometric data of NGC 2366
were obtained. They were complemented by HI synthesis data from the THINGS
survey. We searched for line-splitting both in Halpha and HI by performing a
Gaussian decomposition. To get an idea whether the expansion velocities are
high enough for a gas blow-away, we used the pseudo-isothermal halo model,
which gives us realistic values for the escape velocities of NGC 2366. The good
data quality also allowed us to discuss some peculiarities of the morphology
and the dynamics in NGC 2366.
  Results. A large red-shifted outflow north west of the giant extragalactic
HII region with an expansion velocity of up to 50 km/s is found in Halpha, but
not in HI. Additionally, a blue-shifted component north of the giant
extragalactic HII region was detected both in Halpha and HI with an expansion
velocity of up to 30 km/s. A comparison with the escape velocities of NGC 2366
reveals that the gas does not have enough kinetic energy to leave the
gravitational potential.

sweeping up concentrations of mixed polarity magnetic field. Along supergranule
boundaries and junctions, there is a strong correlation between magnetic flux
and bright chromospheric and transition region emission.
  Aim: The aim is to investigate the relationship between photospheric flows
and small flare-like brightenings seen in Extreme Ultraviolet images.
  Method: We describe observations of small eruptions seen in quiet Sun images
taken with the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on STEREO. The photospheric
flows during the eruption build-up phase are investigated by tracking granules
in high resolution MDI continuum images.
  Results: Eruptions with characteristics of small coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) occur at the junctions of supergranular cells. The eruptions produce
brightening at the onset site, dark cloud or small filament ejections, and
faint waves moving with plane-of-sky speeds up to 150 km/s. In the two examples
studied, they appear to be activated by converging and rotating supergranular
flows, twisting small concentrations of opposite polarity magnetic field. An
estimate of the occurrence rate is about 1400 events per day over the whole
Sun. One third of these events seem to be associated with waves. Typically, the
waves last for about 30 min and travel a distance of 100 arcsec, so at any one
time they cover 1/30th of the lower corona.

classification of knotted tori up to isotopy in the metastable dimension range

  Theorem. Assume that p+4q/3+2<m<p+3q/2+2 and m>2p+q+2. Then the set of smooth
embeddings S^p x S^q -> S^m up to isotopy is infinite if and only if either q+1

here, using numerical simulations, how this released energy and other related
quantities (notably the binding energy and size of the virialized structure)
depends on the initial conditions, for the one parameter family of starting
configurations given by randomly distributing N cold particles in a spherical
volume. Previous studies have established that the minimal size reached by the
system scales approximately as N^{-1/3}, a behaviour which follows trivially
when the growth of perturbations (which regularize the singularity of the cold
collapse in the infinite N limit) are assumed to be unaffected by the
boundaries. Our study shows that the energy ejected grows approximately in
proportion to N^{1/3}, while the fraction of the initial mass ejected grows
only very slowly with N, approximately logarithmically, in the range of N
simulated. We examine in detail the mechanism of this mass and energy ejection,
showing explicitly that it arises from the interplay of the growth of
perturbations with the finite size of the system. A net lag of particles
compared to their uniform spherical collapse trajectories develops first at the
boundaries and then propagates into the volume during the collapse. Particles
in the outer shells are then ejected as they scatter through the time dependent
potential of an already re-expanding central core. Using modified initial
configurations we explore the importance of fluctuations at different scales,
and discreteness (i.e. non-Vlasov) effects in the dynamics.

action (CTP 2PI CGEA) techniques, we study the response of an open interacting
electronic system to time-dependent external electromagnetic fields. We show
that the CTP 2PI CGEA is invariant under a simultaneous gauge transformation of
the external field and the full Schwinger-Keldysh propagator, and that this
property holds even when the loop expansion of the CTP 2PI CGEA is truncated at
arbitrary order. The effective action approach provides a systematic way of
calculating the propagator and response functions of the system, via the
Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Bethe-Salpeter equations, respectively. We
show that, due to the invariance of the CTP 2PI CGEA under external gauge
transformations, the response functions calculated from it satisfy the
Ward-Takahashi hierarchy, thus warranting the conservation of the electronic
current beyond the expectation value level. We also clarify the connection
between nonlinear response theory and the WT hierarchy, and discuss an example
of an ad hoc approximation that violate it. These findings may be useful in the
study of current fluctuations in correlated electronic pumping devices.

supernova driven Galactic winds with wind speeds of about 150 km/s in the
Galactic plane. Galactic winds of this strength are incompatible with current
isotropic models for Cosmic Ray transport. In order to reproduce our local CRs
in the presence of Galactic winds, charged CRs are required to be much more
localized than in the standard isotropic GALPROP models. This requires that
anisotropic diffusion is the dominant diffusion mode in the interstellar
medium, particularly that the diffusion in the disk and in the halo are
different. In addition small scale phenomena such as trapping by molecular
cloud complexes and the structure of our local environment might influence the
secondary CR production rate and our local CR density gradients. We introduce
an anisotropic convection driven transport model (aCDM) which is consistent
with the Galactic wind observations by ROSAT. This also explains the large
bulge/disk ratio as observed by INTEGRAL. Furthermore such models predict an
increase in the $e^+/(e^++e^-)$-fraction as observed by PAMELA and HEAT, if the
synchrotron constraints in the 408 MHz and WMAP range are taken into account.
No additional contribution from Dark Matter is required. The aCDM is able to
explain the absence of a positron annihilation signal from molecular clouds as
observed by INTEGRAL by virtue of a mechanism which confines and isotropizes
CRs between MCs. We find that the EGRET excess of diffuse $\gamma$-rays
currently cannot be explained by astrophysical effects in this type of model
and that the interpretation of the EGRET excess as Dark Matter annihilation is
perfectly consistent with all observational constraints from local CR fluxes

One can define the singular support of $\xi$ to be the singular support of the

characteristic variety). A powerful property of the singular support is that it
is a coisotropic subvariety of $T^*X$. This is the integrability theorem (see
[KKS, Mal, Gab]). This theorem turned out to be useful in representation theory
of real reductive groups (see e.g. [AG_AMOT, AS, Say]).
  The aim of this paper is to give an analog of this theorem to the
non-Archimedean case. The theory of D-modules is not available to us so we need
a different definition of the singular support. We use the notion wave front
set from [Hef] and define the singular support to be its Zariski closure. Then
we prove that the singular support satisfies some property that we call weakly
coisotropic, which is weaker than being coisotropic but is enough for some
applications. We also prove some other properties of the singular support that
were trivial in the Archimedean case (using the algebraic definition) but not
obvious in the non-Archimedean case.

thick layers. Modelled masers form in rings with radii consistent with those
found in VLBI observations and with earlier models. This agreement requires the
adoption of a radio photosphere of radius approximately twice that of the
stellar photosphere, in agreement with observations. A radio photosphere of
this size renders invisible certain maser sites with high amplification at low
radii, and conceals high-velocity shocks, which are absent in radio continuum
observations. The SiO masers are brightest at an optical phase of 0.1 to 0.25,
which is consistent with observed phase-lags. Dust can have both mild and
profound effects on the maser emission. Maser rings, a shock and the optically

this modifies the atomic momentum while the atom is enveloped in the light. The
standard view of the optical dipole force indicates that red-detuned light
should attract the atom towards high intensity. This should increase the
average momentum per photon to $\textbf{p}_{0} n$, where $\textbf{p}_{0}$ is
the photon momentum in free space and $n$ is the average refractive index due
to the presence of the atom in the light. We show, however, that this is the
wrong conclusion and that the atom is in fact repelled from the light by the
dispersive forces, giving the photons a momentum $\textbf{p}_{0} /n$. This
leads us to identify Abraham's optical momentum with the kinetic momentum
transfer. The form due to Minkowski is similarly associated with the canonical
momentum. We consider the possibility of demonstrating this in the laboratory,

Nevertheless, such channels are able to maintain efficient and selective
transport. It has been proposed that attractive interactions between the
transported molecules and the channel can increase the transport efficiency and
that the selectivity of such channels can be based on the strength of the
interaction of the specifically transported molecules with the channel. Herein,
we study the transport through narrow channels in a framework of a general
kinetic theory, which naturally incorporates multi-particle occupancy of the
channel and non-single-file transport. We study how the transport efficiency
and the probability of translocation through the channel are affected by
inter-particle interactions in the confined space inside the channel, and
establish conditions for selective transport. We compare the predictions of the

agreement. Finally, we discuss applications of the theory to the design of
artificial nano-molecular sieves.

discrepancy. In contrast to earlier X-ray analyses where the very circular
surface brightness has been inferred as Abell 1689 being spherically symmetric

alpha galaxies contain considerable amounts of dust. This implies that Lyman
alpha galaxies are not primordial, as has been thought in the past. However,
this dust has not been directly detected in emission; rather it has been
inferred based on extinction estimates from rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and
optical observations. This can be tricky, as both dust and old stars redden
galactic spectra at the wavelengths used to infer dust. Measuring dust emission
directly from these galaxies is thus a more accurate way to estimate the total
dust mass, giving us real physical information on the stellar populations and
interstellar medium (ISM) enrichment. New generation instruments such as the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA), should be
able to detect dust emission from some of these galaxies in the sub-mm. Using
measurements of the UV spectral slopes, we derive far-infrared flux predictions
for of a sample of 23 z > 4 Lyman alpha galaxies. We find that in only a few
hours, we can detect dust emission from 39 +/- 22% of our Lyman alpha galaxies.
Comparing these results to those found from a sample of 21 Lyman break galaxies
(LBGs), we find that LBGs are on average 60% more likely to be detected than
Lyman alpha galaxies, implying that they are more dusty, and thus indicating an
evolutionary difference between these objects. These observations will provide
better constraints on dust in these galaxies than those derived from their UV
and optical fluxes alone. Undeniable proof of dust in these galaxies could
explain the larger than expected Lyman alpha equivalent widths seen in many
Lyman alpha galaxies today.

accretion flow onto a gravitating star, in the context of core-collapse
supernova explosions. Our focus is on the effect of nuclear dissociation below
the shock on the linear growth, and non-linear saturation, of non-radial
oscillations of the shocked fluid. We combine two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamic simulations using FLASH2.5 with a solution to the linear
eigenvalue problem, and demonstrate the consistency of the two approaches.
Previous studies of this `Standing Accretion Shock Instability' (SASI) have
focused either on zero-energy accretion flows without nuclear dissociation, or
made use of a detailed finite-temperature nuclear equation of state and
included strong neutrino heating. Our main goal in this and subsequent papers
is to introduce equations of state of increasing complexity, in order to
isolate the various competing effects. In this work we employ an ideal gas
equation of state with a constant rate of nuclear dissociation below the shock,
and do not include neutrino heating. We find that a negative Bernoulli
parameter below the shock significantly lowers the real frequency, growth rate,
and saturation amplitude of the SASI. A decrease in the adiabatic index has
similar effects. The non-linear development of the instability is characterized
by an expansion of the shock driven by turbulent kinetic energy at nearly
constant internal energy. Our results also provide further insight into the
instability mechanism: the rate of growth of a particular mode is fastest when
the radial advection time from the shock to the accretor overlaps with the
period of a standing lateral sound wave. The fastest-growing mode can therefore
be modified by nuclear dissociation.

employed by observational astronomers for fitting Poisson-distributed data can
give rise to intrinsically biased model parameter estimates, even in the high
counts regime, unless care is taken over the parameterization of the problem.
For a small number of problems, previous studies have shown that the fractional
bias introduced by these approximations is often small when the counts are
high. However, we show that for a broad class of problem, unless the number of
data bins is far smaller than \sqrt{N_c}, where N_c is the total number of
counts in the dataset, the bias will still likely be comparable to, or even
exceed, the statistical error. Conversely, we find that fits using Cash's
C-statistic give comparatively unbiased parameter estimates when the counts are
high. Taking into account their well-known problems in the low count regime, we
conclude that these approximate chi^2 methods should not routinely be used for
fitting an arbitrary, parameterized model to Poisson-distributed data,
irrespective of the number of counts per bin, and instead the C-statistic
should be adopted. We discuss several practical aspects of using the
C-statistic in modelling real data. We illustrate the bias for two specific
problems, measuring the count-rate from a lightcurve and obtaining the
temperature of a thermal plasma from its X-ray spectrum measured with the
Chandra X-ray observatory. In the context of X-ray astronomy, we argue the bias
could give rise to systematically mis-calibrated satellites and a ~5-10% shift

systematic brightness trends of SnIa datapoints with respect to a best fit
cosmological model at high redshifts. It is based on binning the normalized
differences between the SnIa distance moduli and the corresponding best fit
values in the context of a specific cosmological model (eg LCDM). We then focus
on the highest redshift bin and extend its size towards lower redshifts until
the Binned Normalized Difference (BND) changes sign (crosses 0) at a redshift
z_c (bin size N_c). The bin size N_c of this crossing (the statistical
variable) is then compared with the corresponding crossing bin size N_{mc} for
Monte Carlo data realizations based on the best fit model. We find that the
crossing bin size N_c obtained from the Union08 and Gold06 data with respect to
the best fit LCDM model is anomalously large compared to N_{mc} of the
corresponding Monte Carlo datasets obtained from the best fit LCDM in each
case. In particular, only 2.2% of the Monte Carlo LCDM datasets are consistent
with the Gold06 value of N_c while the corresponding probability for the
Union08 value of N_c is 5.3%. Thus, according to this statistic, the
probability that the high redshift brightness bias of the Union08 and Gold06

available, so we use a background subtraction technique to estimate the
absolute magnitude distribution of true neighbors. (Our method exploits the
fact that, although we do not know the redshifts of the neighbors, we do know
the redshift of the absorbers.) The absolute magnitude distribution we find is
well described by a bell-shaped curve peaking at about rest-frame M_B = -20,
corresponding to L/L* = 1.4. A comparison of this observed distribution to ones
in the literature suggests that it is unlikely to be drawn from a population
dominated by late-type galaxies. However, the strong equivalent width systems
may be associated with later galaxy types. Finally we use the absolute
magnitude distribution, along with the observed covering fraction of about 8
percent, to estimate the extent of the MgII absorbing gas around a galaxy. For
an L* galaxy, this scale is about 70 kpc/h. We provide an analytic description
of our method, which is generally applicable to any dataset in which redshifts

for flame models, we consider, in this paper, high-resolution three-dimensional
simulations of the small-scale dynamics of nuclear flames in the supernova
environment in which the details of the flame structure are fully resolved. The
range of densities examined, 1 to $8 \times 10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$, spans the
transition from the laminar flamelet regime to the distributed burning regime
where small scale turbulence disrupts the flame. The use of a low Mach number
algorithm facilitates the accurate resolution of the thermal structure of the
flame and the inviscid turbulent kinetic energy cascade, while implicitly
incorporating kinetic energy dissipation at the grid-scale cutoff. For an
assumed background of isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence with an energy
characteristic of SN Ia, we find a transition density between 1 and $3 \times
10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$ where the nature of the burning changes qualitatively. By $1
\times 10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$, energy diffusion by conduction and radiation is
exceeded, on the flame scale, by turbulent advection. As a result, the
effective Lewis Number approaches unity. That is, the flame resembles a laminar
flame, but is turbulently broadened with an effective diffusion coefficient,
$D_T \sim u' l$, where $u'$ is the turbulent intensity and $l$ is the integral
scale. For the larger integral scales characteristic of a real supernova, the
flame structure is predicted to become complex and unsteady. Implications for a
possible transition to detonation are discussed.

and how the details of recombination affect the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropies. We present a detailed calculation of the spectral line
distortions on the CMB spectrum arising from the Lyman-alpha and the lowest
two-photon transitions in the recombination of hydrogen (H), and the
corresponding lines from helium (He). The peak of these distortions mainly
comes from the Lyman-alpha transition and occurs at about 170 microns, which is
the Wien part of the CMB. The major theoretical limitation for extracting
cosmological parameters from the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we
can calculate the cosmological recombination process. With this motivation, we
perform a multi-level calculation of the recombination of H and He with the
addition of the spin-forbidden transition for neutral helium (He I), plus the
higher order two-photon transitions for H and among singlet states of He I. We
find that the inclusion of the spin-forbidden transition results in more than a
percent change in the ionization fraction, while the other transitions give
much smaller effects. Last we modify RECFAST by introducing one more parameter
to reproduce recent numerical results for the speed-up of helium recombination.
Together with the existing hydrogen `fudge factor', we vary these two
parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological
recombination. By using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with Planck forecast
data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than 10% for
He I and 1% for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological
parameters.

[Yavin, {\it et al.}, PNAS, {\bf 102}, 3546, (2005)]. In this CT mechanism,
electrons are released by recently adsorbed BER enzymes and travel along the

nearby lesions and guanine radicals. We develop a stochastic model to describe
the electron dynamics, and compute probabilities of electron capture by guanine

return, and ensemble-average these results over guanine radical distributions.
Our statistical results provide the rules that enable us to perform

stochastic model that describes the entry process at the level of binding of

model, receptors attach the cell membrane to the viral membrane, while
subsequent binding of coreceptors enables fusion. The model quantifies the
competition between fusion and endocytotic entry pathways. Relative

analytically in the high viral spike density limit. We delineate parameter

regularized estimation in machine learning and statistics. In addition to
values of $F$, QQMM requires the (sub)gradient of $V$. Two features of QQMM
help keep low the number of evaluations of the objective function it needs.
First, QQMM provides good control over stopping the iterative search. This
feature makes QQMM well adapted to statistical problems because in such
problems the objective function is based on random data and therefore stopping
early is sensible. Secondly, QQMM uses a complex method for determining trial
minimizers of $F$. After a description of the problem and algorithm a
simulation study comparing QQMM to the popular BFGS optimization algorithm is
described. The simulation study and other experiments suggest that QQMM is
generally substantially faster than BFGS in the problem domain for which it was

computing and numerical analysis. Recently, several works were devoted to the
derivation of spectrally accurate schemes for the Boltzmann equation, but very
few of them were concerned with the stability analysis of the method. In
particular there was no result of stability except when the method is modified
in order to enforce the posivity preservation, which destroys the spectral
accuracy. In this paper we propose a new method to study the stability of
homogeneous Boltzmann equations perturbed by smoothed balanced operators which
do not preserve positivity of the distribution. This method takes advantage of
the ""spreading"" property of the collision, together with estimates on
regularity and entropy production. As an application we prove stability and
convergence of spectral methods for the Boltzmann equation, when the
discretization parameter is large enough (with explicit bound).

Submitted to STOC 2009",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we consider the communication of information in the presence of
an online adversarial jammer. In the setting under study, a sender wishes to
communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword x=x_1,...,x_n
symbol-by-symbol over a communication channel. The adversarial jammer can view
the transmitted symbols x_i one at a time, and can change up to a p-fraction of
them. However, the decisions of the jammer must be made in an online or causal
manner. More generally, for a delay parameter 0<d<1, we study the scenario in
which the jammer's decision on the corruption of x_i must depend solely on x_j
for j < i - dn. In this work, we initiate the study of codes for online
adversaries, and present a tight characterization of the amount of information
one can transmit in both the 0-delay and, more generally, the d-delay online
setting. We prove tight results for both additive and overwrite jammers when
the transmitted symbols are assumed to be over a sufficiently large field F.
Finally, we extend our results to a jam-or-listen online model, where the
online adversary can either jam a symbol or eavesdrop on it. We again provide a
tight characterization of the achievable rate for several variants of this
model. The rate-regions we prove for each model are informational-theoretic in
nature and hold for computationally unbounded adversaries. The rate regions are
characterized by ""simple"" piecewise linear functions of p and d. The codes we
construct to attain the optimal rate for each scenario are computationally
efficient.

randomly generating them. For any constant k, when m=O(n^{1+1/[2k(k+3)]}),
RandGraph generates an asymptotically uniform random graph with n vertices, m
edges, and no cycle of length at most k using O(n^2m) operations. We also
characterize the approximation error for finite values of n. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.
RandGraph works by sequentially adding $m$ edges to an empty graph with n
vertices. Recently, such sequential algorithms have been successful for random
sampling problems. Our main contributions to this line of research includes
introducing a new approach for sequentially approximating edge-specific
probabilities at each step of the algorithm, and providing a new method for

information about the outcome of the star forming process in different
environments (see, e.g., Blaauw 1991, and references therein). Binarity is also
a key ingredient in stellar population studies, and is a prerequisite to
calibrate the binary evolution channels. In this paper we present an overview
of several commonly used methods to pair individual stars into binary systems,
which we refer to as pairing functions. These pairing functions are frequently
used by observers and computational astronomers, either for their mathematical
convenience, or because they roughly describe the expected outcome of the star
forming process. We discuss the consequences of each pairing function for the
interpretation of observations and numerical simulations. The binary fraction
and mass ratio distribution generally depend strongly on the selection of the
range in primary spectral type in a sample. The mass ratio distribution and
binary fraction derived from a binarity survey among a mass-limited sample of
targets is thus not representative for the population as a whole. Neither
theory nor observations indicate that random pairing of binary components from
the mass distribution, the simplest pairing function, is realistic. It is more
likely that companion stars are formed in a disk around a star, or that a
pre-binary core fragments into two binary components. The results of our
analysis are important for (i) the interpretation of the observed mass ratio
distribution and binary fraction for a sample of stars, (ii) a range of
possible initial condition algorithms for star cluster simulations, and (iii)
how to discriminate between the different star formation scenarios.

onset of superfluid turbulence gives vc = sqrt(8*kappa*omega/beta), where beta
is of order 1 and depends on the coefficients of mutual friction. This agrees
well with the data and implies that vc is a universal critical velocity that is
independent of geometry, size, and surface properties of the oscillating body.
This is confirmed by comparing our data on spheres with vc obtained with other
oscillating structures by other groups. Numerical simulations indicate somewhat
larger critical velocity, above which a rapid increase in vortex length is
observed.

nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation. In this report we present
a selection of new reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly
sensitive to the symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State (Iso-EoS). We
will first discuss the Isospin Equilibration Dynamics. At low energies this
manifests via the recently observed Dynamical Dipole Radiation, due to a
collective neutron-proton oscillation with the symmetry term acting as a
restoring force. At higher beam energies Iso-EoS effects will be seen in
Imbalance Ratio Measurements, in particular from the correlations with the
total kinetic energy loss. For fragmentation reactions in central events we
suggest to look at the coupling between isospin distillation and radial flow.
In Neck Fragmentation reactions important $Iso-EoS$ information can be obtained
from the correlation between isospin content and alignement. The high density
symmetry term can be probed from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at
relativistic energies (few AGeV range). Rather isospin sensitive observables
are proposed from nucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson
production. The possibility to shed light on the controversial neutron/proton
effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested. A large
symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an ""earlier""
hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. A suitable treatment of the
isovector interaction in the partonic EoS appears very relevant.

varying linearly with time. Their magnetization is calculated by means of a
weak formulation in the magnetostatic approximation of the Maxwell equations

large-scale open magnetic fields, what causes the episodic ejection of blobs
remains unclear. Here by analogy with the coronal mass ejection on the Sun, we
propose a magnetohydrodynamical model for episodic ejections from black holes
associated with the closed magnetic fields in an accretion flow. Shear and
turbulence of the accretion flow deform the field and result in the formation
of a flux rope in the disk corona. Energy and helicity are accumulated and
stored until a threshold is reached. The system then loses its equilibrium and
the flux rope is thrust outward by the magnetic compression force in a
catastrophic way. Our calculations show that for parameters appropriate for the
black hole in our Galactic center, the plasmoid can attain relativistic speeds
in about 35 minutes.

and 8$\mu$m emission in nearby galaxies. In order to understand their molecular
gas properties, we used the Owens Valley Radio Observatory to map the
CO(J=1--0) emission in three spurs emanating from the inner northwestern spiral
arm of M51. We report CO detections from all three spurs. The molecular gas
mass and surface density are M$_{H2} \sim3\times10^6$ M$_{\sun}$ and
$\Sigma_{H2} \sim$50 M$_{\sun}$ pc$^{-2}$. Thus, relative to the spiral arms,
the spurs are extremely weak features. However, since the spurs are extended
perpendicular to the spiral arms for $\sim$500 pc and contain adequate fuel for
star formation, they may be the birthplace for observed inter-arm HII regions.
This reduces the requirement for the significant time delay that would be
otherwise needed if the inter-arm star formation was initiated in the spiral
arms. Larger maps of galaxies at similar depth are required to further
understand the formation and evolution of these spurs and their role in star
formation - such data should be forthcoming with the new CARMA and future ALMA
telescopes and can be compared to several recent numerical simulations that
have been examining the evolution of spiral arm spurs.

oscillations frequencies are closely related to stellar interior properties via
the density and sound speed profiles. Since these are tightly linked with the
mass and evolutionary state, we can expect to determine the age and mass of a
star from the comparison of its oscillation spectrum with predictions of
stellar models. Such a comparison suffers both from the problems we face when
modeling a particular star (as the uncertainties on global parameters and
chemical composition) and from our misunderstanding of processes at work in
stellar interiors (as the transport processes that may lead to core mixing and
affect the model ages). For stars where observations have provided precise and
numerous oscillation frequencies together with accurate global parameters and
additional information (as the radius or the mass if the star is in a binary
system, the interferometric radius or the mean density if the star is an
exoplanet host), we can also expect to better constrain the physical
description of the stellar structure and to get a more reliable age estimation.
After a survey of stellar pulsations, we present some seismic diagnostics that
can be used to infer the age of a star as well as their limitations. We then
illustrate the ability of asteroseismology to scrutinize stellar interiors on
the basis of a few exemples. In the years to come, extended very precise
asteroseismic observations are expected, in photometry or in spectroscopy, from
ground-based (HARPS, CORALIE, ELODIE, UVES, UCLES, SIAMOIS, SONG) or spatial
devices (MOST, CoRoT, WIRE, Kepler, PLATO). This will considerably enlarge the
sample of stars eligible to asteroseismic age determination and should allow to
estimate the age of individual stars with a 10-20% accuracy.

silicon. We are able to determine the ground-state spin configuration for one
to four holes occupying the quantum dot and find a spin filling with
alternating spin-down and spin-up holes, which is confirmed by
magnetospectroscopy up to 9T. Additionally, a so far inexplicable feature in
single-charge quantum dots in many materials systems is analyzed in detail. We
observe excitations of the zero-hole ground-state energy of the quantum dot,

that, in the case of an uncorrelated in time random velocity field,
preferential concentration takes the form of a condition on the field history
leading to the current particle positions. This generalized form of
preferential concentration appears to be a necessary condition for clustering
in the uncorrelated in time case. The standard interpretation of preferential
concentration is recovered considering local time averages of the velocity
field. In the compressible case, preferential concentration occurs in regions
of negative divergence of the field. In the incompressible case, it occurs in

inflection points which cascade to turbulence in a relatively mild way, wall
bounded flows are deprived of (inertial) instability modes at low Reynolds

coexistence of laminar and turbulent domains at intermediate Reynolds numbers,
well below the range where (viscous) instabilities can show up. There can even
be no unstable mode at all, as for plane Couette flow (pCf) or for Poiseuille

better understood, statistical properties of the transition itself are yet

to the temporal theory of the transition to turbulence in terms of chaotic

frequency--modulated quantum harmonic oscillator. We analytically relate the
squeezing parameter to the irreversible work and the degree of nonadiabaticity
of the frequency transformation. We furthermore determine the optimal
modulation that leads to maximal squeezing, and discuss its implementation as
well as the detection of squeezing in single cold ion traps.

flow $v_2$ and its transverse momentum dependence $v_2(p_T)$ for the gluon
matter created in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. To make
comparisons with the experimental data at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC), parton-hadron duality is assumed. We find that whereas the
integrated $v_2$ matches the experimental data, the gluon (or pion) $v_2(p_T)$
is about 20-50% smaller than the experimental data. Hadronization via gluon
fragmentation and quark recombination seems to be the key to explaining the
necessary jump of $v_2(p_T)$ from the partonic to the hadronic phase. We also
show that the elliptic flow values moderately depend on the chosen freezeout
condition, which will thus constrain the shear viscosity to the entropy density
ratio of the quark gluon plasma created at RHIC.
