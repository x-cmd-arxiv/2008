of D0 and D2 branes on a single D6 brane wrapping an arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau
threefold. The three-dimensional crystalline structure is determined by the
quiver diagram and the brane tiling which characterize the low energy effective
theory of D branes. The crystal is composed of atoms of different colors, each
of which corresponds to a node of the quiver diagram, and the chemical bond is
dictated by the arrows of the quiver diagram. BPS states are constructed by
removing atoms from the crystal. This generalizes the earlier results on the
BPS state counting to an arbitrary non-compact toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We
point out that a proper understanding of the relation between the topological
string theory and the crystal melting involves the wall crossing in the
Donaldson-Thomas theory.

discovered by BeppoSAX in 1998 during an observation of the Galactic centre.
The source was identified as a High-Mass X-ray Binary with an OB SuperGiant
companion. Displaying short and bright flares and an unusually very-low
quiescent level implying intensity dynamical range as large as 1e3-4, the
source was classified as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient. The mechanism
triggering the different temporal behaviour observed between the classical
SGXBs and the recently discovered class of SFXTs is still debated. The
discovery of long orbits (>15 d) should help to discriminate between emission
models and bring constraints.
  We analysed archival INTEGRAL data on SAX J1818.6-1703. We built short- and
long-term light curves and performed timing analysis in order to study the
temporal behaviour of SAX J1818.6-1703 on different time scales. INTEGRAL
revealed an unusually long orbital period of 30.0+/-0.2 d and an elapsed
accretion phase of ~6 d in the transient SGXB SAX J1818.6-1703. This implies an
elliptical orbit and constraints the possible supergiant spectral type between
B0.5-1I with eccentricities e~0.3-0.4 (for average fundamental parameters of
supergiant stars). During the accretion phase, the source behaved like
classical SGXBs. The huge variations of the observed X-ray flux can be
explained through accretion of macro-clumps formed within the stellar wind. Our
analysis strengthens the model which predicts that SFXTs behave as SGXBs but
with different orbital parameters, thus different temporal behaviour.

average, in the plane of the sky (otherwise it is not possible to derive a
geometric distance from direct imaging of light echoes). We consider the
biasing introduced by the high efficiency of forward scattering. We conclude
that most of the knots are in fact likely to lie in front of the plane of the
sky, thus invalidating the Kervella et al. result. We also show that the flat
equatorial disk structure determined by Feast is unlikely; instead, the
morphology of the nebula is more probably bipolar, with a significant tilt of
its axis with respect to the plane of the sky. Although the Kervella et al.
distance result is invalidated, we show that high-resolution polarimetric
imaging has the potential to yield a valid geometric distance to this important

the electron, which is a sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.
The value is determined by measuring the precession of the molecule's spin in a
plane perpendicular to an applied electric field. The longer this precession
evolves coherently, the higher the precision of the measurement. For molecules
in a trap, this coherence time could be very long indeed. We evaluate the
sensitivity of an experiment where neutral molecules are trapped electrically,
and compare this to an equivalent measurement in a molecular beam. We consider
the use of a Stark decelerator to load the trap from a supersonic source, and
calculate the deceleration efficiency for YbF molecules in both strong-field
seeking and weak-field seeking states. With a 1s holding time in the trap, the
statistical sensitivity could be ten times higher than it is in the beam
experiment, and this could improve by a further factor of five if the trap can
be loaded from a source of larger emittance. We study some effects due to field
inhomogeneity in the trap and find that rotation of the electric field
direction, leading to an inhomogeneous geometric phase shift, is the primary
obstacle to a sensitive trap-based measurement.

anisotropy of the dispersion law and electron scattering mechanisms is taken
into account. Impurity-related and acoustic scattering mechanisms are analyzed.
Polarization dependence of the spontaneous emission by hot electrons is found
out. At unidirectional pressure applied or high irradiation intensities, the
polarization dependence also appears in the coefficient of light absorption by
free electrons.

Dirac mass term of the neutrinos is generically as strong as the one in the
up-type quark mass term. We propose a mechanism to partially or completely
cancel this hierarchy in the light neutrino mass matrix in the seesaw context.
The two main ingredients of the cancellation mechanism are the existence of
three fermionic gauge singlets and of a discrete flavor symmetry G_f which is
broken at a higher scale than SO(10). Two realizations of the cancellation
mechanism are presented. The realization based on the Frobenius group T7 = Z7 x
Z3 leads to a partial cancellation of the hierarchy and relates maximal 2-3
lepton mixing with the geometric hierarchy of the up-quark masses. In the
realization with the group Sigma(81) the cancellation is complete and
tri-bimaximal lepton mixing is reproduced at the lowest order. In both cases,
to fully accommodate the leptonic data we take into account additional effects
such as effects of higher-dimensional operators involving more than one flavon.
The heavy neutral fermion mass spectra are considered. For both realizations we
analyze the flavon potential at the renormalizable level as well as ways to
generate the Cabibbo angle.

internal shocks propagating within a highly relativistic outflow. The launch of
Fermi offers the prospect of observations with unprecedented sensitivity in
high-energy (>100 MeV) gamma-rays. The aim is to explore the predictions for HE
emission from internal shocks, taking into account both dynamical and radiative
aspects, and to deduce how HE observations constrain the properties of the
relativistic outflow. The emission is modeled by combining a time-dependent
radiative code with a dynamical code giving the evolution of the physical
conditions in the shocked regions.Synthetic lightcurves and spectra are
compared to observations. The HE emission deviates significantly from
analytical estimates, which tend to overpredict the IC component, when the time
dependence and full cross-sections are included. The exploration of the
parameter space favors the case where the dominant process in the BATSE range
is synchrotron emission. The HE component becomes stronger for weaker magnetic
fields. The HE lightcurve can display a prolonged pulse duration due to IC
emission, or even a delayed peak compared to the BATSE range.Alternatively,
having dominant IC emission in the BATSE range requires most electrons to be
accelerated into a steep power-law distribution and implies strong 2nd order IC
scattering. In this case, the BATSE and HE lightcurves are very similar. The
combined dynamical and radiative approach allows a firm appraisal of GRB HE
prompt emission. A diagnostic procedure is presented to identify from
observations the dominant emission process and derive constrains on the bulk
Lorentz factor, particle density and magnetic field of the outflow.

data obtained with RXTE and INTEGRAL.
  In the hard state, we detect PAH emission features in the MIR spectrum of GRS
1915+105, which prove the presence of dust in the system. The dust is confirmed
by the detection in the hard state of a warm MIR excess in the broadband
spectral energy distribution of GRS 1915 105. This excess cannot be explained
by the MIR synchrotron emission from the compact jets as GRS 1915+105 was not

emission, part of the MIR excess in the soft state is non-thermal, and could be
due either to free-free emission from an X-ray driven wind or X-ray

in the central, kpc-sized region of their active hosts, where the jets
propagate and the lobes expand, interacting with the surrounding interstellar
medium (ISM). We recently developed a new dynamical-radiative model to describe
the evolution of the GPS phenomenon (Stawarz et al. 2008): as the relativistic
jets propagate through the ISM, gradually engulfing narrow-line emitting gas
clouds along their way, the electron population of the expanding lobes evolves,
emitting synchrotron light, as well as inverse-Compton radiation via
up-scattering of the photon fields from the host galaxy and its active nucleus.
The model, which successfully reproduces the key features of the GPS radio
sources as a class, provides a description of the evolution of their spectral
energy distribution (SED) with the lobes' expansion, predicting significant and
complex X-ray to gamma-ray emission. We apply here the model to the broad-band
SED's of a sample of known, X-ray emitting GPS galaxies, and show that: (i) the
free-free absorption mechanism enables us to reproduce the radio continuum at
frequencies below the turnover; (ii) the lobes' non-thermal, inverse-Compton
emission can account for the observed X-ray spectra, providing a viable
alternative to the thermal, accretion-dominated scenario. We also show that, in
our sample, the relationship between the X-ray and radio hydrogen column
densitities, N_H and N_HI, is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if
confirmed, would support the scenario of high-energy emitting lobes.

photoreceptor. They involve the hydrolysis of cGMP, a soluble cyclic
nucleotide, that gates ionic channels located in the outer segment membrane. We
shall study here the rate by which cGMP is hydrolyzed by activated
phosphodiesterase (PDE). This process has been characterized experimentally by
two different rate constants $\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$: $\beta_d$ accounts
for the effect of all spontaneously active PDE in the outer segment, and
$\beta_{sub}$ characterizes cGMP hydrolysis induced by a single light-activated
PDE. So far, no attempt has been made to derive the experimental values of
$\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$ from a theoretical model, which is the goal of this
work. Using a model of diffusion in the confined rod geometry, we derive
analytical expressions for $\beta_d$ and $\beta_{sub}$ by calculating the flux
of cGMP molecules to an activated PDE site. We obtain the dependency of these
rate constants as a function of the outer segment geometry, the PDE activation
and deactivation rates and the aqueous cGMP diffusion constant. Our formulas
show good agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, we use our
derivation to model the time course of the cGMP concentration in a

a recent result on a version of Smoluchowski's coagulation equations in which
the number of aggregations is limited. The latter models the deterministic
evolution of concentrations of particles in a medium where particles coalesce
pairwise as time passes and each particle can only perform a given number of
aggregations. Under appropriate assumptions, the concentrations of particles
converge as time tends to infinity to some measure which bears a striking
resemblance with the distribution of the total population of a Galton-Watson
process started from two ancestors. Roughly speaking, the configuration model
is a stochastic construction which aims at producing a typical graph on a set
of vertices with pre-described degrees. Specifically, one attaches to each
vertex a certain number of stubs, and then join pairwise the stubs uniformly at
random to create edges between vertices. In this work, we use the configuration
model as the stochastic counterpart of Smoluchowski's coagulation equations
with limited aggregations. We establish a hydrodynamical type limit theorem for
the empirical measure of the shapes of clusters in the configuration model when
the number of vertices tends to $\infty$. The limit is given in terms of the

increases, the radial distribution functions reflect reduced geometric

phase difference between the superconducting order parameters on opposite sides
of the junction. By analogy, differences in order parameters across a junction
should lead to coherent tunneling of the condensed objects that exist in the
broken symmetry state. To exhibit the generality of this phenomenon and make
predictions from a realistic model, we study the case of a tunnel junction
between two itinerant antiferromagnets. At the mean-field level, we find an
equilibrium current of the staggered magnetization through the junction that is
proportional the normal state conductance and to $\mathbf{S}_{L}\times
\mathbf{S}_{R}$ where $\mathbf{S}_{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}_{R}$ are the staggered
magnetizations on either sides. Microscopically, this effect comes from
coherent tunneling of spin-one charge-zero particle-hole pairs that have a net
wave vector equal to the antiferromagnetic one. We explain similarities and
differences with the standard DC and AC Josephson effects.

reported in the literature, the spectrum can be fit by a power law, with the
slope predicted by the radio spectrum, modified by low energy absorption
through the Galaxy as determined from the spectrum of the quasar core and by HI
21 cm observations. We obtain a marginally better fit with an model of inverse
Compton emission produced by an electron population that exhibits a cutoff at
(gamma_min delta_10) between about 50 and 80 (assuming Gamma = delta). This
range for gamma_min is higher than has previously been assumed in broad-band
spectral fits to the jet emission. The observed optical flux can be used to
place a lower limit on gamma_min; the constraint is not very strong, but does
suggest that gamma_min must be higher than 1 to avoid overproducing the optical
emission. We investigate the effect of uncertainties in the column density for

accretion onto a ~5x10^9 solar mass black hole. We suggest instead that the AGN

quench a cooling flow over its lifetime and to contribute significantly to the

of AGN feedback may be quenching star formation in elliptical galaxies centered
in cooling halos at late times. An accretion mode that operates in gas-rich
systems, and a spin mode operating at modest accretion rates. The spin
conjecture may be avoided in MS0735 by appealing to Bondi accretion onto a

L^{\alpha} with slope \alpha ~ -3. The number density of [OII] emitting
galaxies above this luminosity declines by a factor of >~2.5 between z ~ 1.35
and z ~ 0.84. In the limit of no number-density evolution, the characteristic
[OII] luminosity, L^*_[OII], defined as the luminosity where the space density
equals 10^{-3.5} dex^{-1} Mpc^{-3}, declines by a factor of ~1.8 over the same
redshift interval. Assuming that L_[OII] is proportional to the star-formation
rate (SFR), and negligible change in the typical dust attenuation in galaxies
at fixed [OII] luminosity, the measured decline in L^*_[OII] implies a ~25% per
Gyr decrease in the amount of star formation in galaxies during this epoch.

density in four redshift bins centered around z~1 by integrating the observed
[OII] luminosity function using a local, empirical calibration between L_[OII]

assumes that the filament is a symmetric bipole. Self-assembled myosin
filaments are shown here to be asymmetric in physiological buffer based on
cross-correlated images from both atomic force microscopy (AFM) and total
internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). Quantitative cross-correlation of
these orthogonal methods produces structural information unavailable to either
method alone in showing that fluorescence intensity along the filament length
is proportional to height. This implies that myosin heads form a shell around
the filament axis, consistent with F-actin binding. A motor density of ~50 -
100 heads/micron is further estimated but with an average of 32% more motors on
one half of any given filament compared to the other, regardless of length. A
purely entropic pyramidal lattice model is developed that qualitatively
captures this lack of length dependence and the distribution of filament
asymmetries. Such strongly asymmetric bipoles are likely to produce an
imbalanced contractile force in cells and in actin-myosin gels, and thereby
contribute to motility as well as cytoskeletal tension.

evaporating primordial black holes, hyper-flares from neutron stars, emissions
from cosmic strings or perhaps extraterrestrial civilizations, but to-date few
searches have been conducted capable of detecting them.
  We are carrying out two searches in hopes of finding and characterizing these
mu-s to ms time scale dispersed radio pulses. These two observing programs are
orthogonal in search space; the Allen Telescope Array's (ATA) ""Fly's Eye""
experiment observes a 100 square degree field by pointing each 6m ATA antenna
in a different direction; by contrast, the Astropulse sky survey at Arecibo is
extremely sensitive but has 1/3,000 of the instantaneous sky coverage.
Astropulse's multibeam data is transferred via the internet to the computers of
millions of volunteers. These computers perform a coherent de-dispersion
analysis faster than the fastest available supercomputers and allow us to
resolve pulses as short as 400 ns. Overall, the Astropulse survey will be 30
times more sensitive than the best previous searches. Analysis of results from
Astropulse is at a very early stage.
  The Fly's Eye was successfully installed at the ATA in December of 2007, and
to-date approximately 450 hours of observation has been performed. We have
detected three pulsars and six giant pulses from the Crab pulsar in our
diagnostic pointing data. We have not yet detected any other convincing bursts
of astronomical origin in our survey data. (Abridged)

turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection on analytical upper bounds on convective
heat transport. We model imperfectly conducting bounding plates in two ways:
using idealized mixed thermal boundary conditions of constant Biot number
$\eta$, continuously interpolating between the previously studied fixed
temperature ($\eta = 0$) and fixed flux ($\eta = \infty$) cases; and by
explicitly coupling the evolution equations in the fluid in the Boussinesq
approximation through temperature and flux continuity to identical upper and
lower conducting plates. In both cases, we systematically formulate a bounding
principle and obtain explicit upper bounds on the Nusselt number $Nu$ in terms
of the usual Rayleigh number $Ra$ measuring the average temperature drop across
the fluid layer, using the ``background method'' developed by Doering and
Constantin. In the presence of plates, we find that the bounds depend on
$\sigma = d/\lambda$, where $d$ is the ratio of plate to fluid thickness and
$\lambda$ is the conductivity ratio, and that the bounding problem may be
mapped onto that for Biot number $\eta = \sigma$. In particular, for each
$\sigma > 0$, for sufficiently large $Ra$ (depending on $\sigma$) we show that
$Nu \leq c(\sigma) R^{1/3} \leq C Ra^{1/2}$, where $C$ is a
$\sigma$-independent constant, and where the control parameter $R$ is a
Rayleigh number defined in terms of the full temperature drop across the entire
plate-fluid-plate system. In the $Ra \to \infty$ limit, the usual fixed
temperature assumption is a singular limit of the general bounding problem,
while fixed flux conditions appear most relevant to the asymptotic $Nu$--$Ra$
scaling even for highly conducting plates.

This work combines Elkin's refinement and Rankin's generalization in the Green

through sets that do not contain a long polynomial progression in order to
construct a set without a long AP. The bounds for r_k(N), the largest size of a

science, in both theory and practice. They are especially useful in external
memory, where their query performance approaches the ideal cost of just one
disk access. Knuth gave an elegant analysis showing that with some simple
collision resolution strategies such as linear probing or chaining, the
expected average number of disk I/Os of a lookup is merely $1+1/2^{\Omega(b)}$,
where each I/O can read a disk block containing $b$ items. Inserting a new item
into the hash table also costs $1+1/2^{\Omega(b)}$ I/Os, which is again almost
the best one can do if the hash table is entirely stored on disk. However, this
assumption is unrealistic since any algorithm operating on an external hash
table must have some internal memory (at least $\Omega(1)$ blocks) to work
with. The availability of a small internal memory buffer can dramatically
reduce the amortized insertion cost to $o(1)$ I/Os for many external memory
data structures. In this paper we study the inherent query-insertion tradeoff
of external hash tables in the presence of a memory buffer. In particular, we
show that for any constant $c>1$, if the query cost is targeted at
$1+O(1/b^{c})$ I/Os, then it is not possible to support insertions in less than
$1-O(1/b^{\frac{c-1}{4}})$ I/Os amortized, which means that the memory buffer
is essentially useless. While if the query cost is relaxed to $1+O(1/b^{c})$
I/Os for any constant $c<1$, there is a simple dynamic hash table with $o(1)$
insertion cost. These results also answer the open question recently posed by
Jensen and Pagh.

temperature interval, but that there necessarily exists, very close to the
critical temperature, a crossover to another regime. The exact nature of the
melting dynamics in this second regime still has to be elucidated. We finally
point out that the descriptions of the physics of the melting transition
inferred from statistical and dynamical models are not completely identical and
discuss the relevance of our model from the biological point of view.

the model successfully reproduces some of the observed properties of real

sequence by the protein proceeds via a succession of 3d motion in the solvent,
1d sliding along the sequence, short hops between neighboring sites, and
intersegmental transfers. Moreover, facilitated diffusion takes place in a
certain range of values of the protein effective charge, that is, the
combination of 1d sliding and 3d motion leads to faster DNA sampling than pure
3d motion. At last, the number of base pairs visited during a sliding event is
comparable to the values deduced from single-molecule experiments. We also
point out and discuss some discrepancies between the predictions of this model

established for a general L\'evy process at first passage below a fixed level.
In this article we use the quintuple law to establish a family of related joint

conditioned to stay positive and positive self-similar Markov processes at both
first and last passage over a fixed level. Here the integer $n$ typically
ranges from three to seven. Moreover, we look at asymptotic overshoot and
undershoot distributions and relate them to overshoot and undershoot
distributions of positive self-similar Markov processes issued from the origin.
Although the relation between the $n$-tuple laws for L\'evy processes and
positive self-similar Markov processes are straightforward thanks to the
Lamperti transformation, by inter-playing the role of a (conditioned) stable
processes as both a (conditioned) L\'evy processes and a positive self-similar

passage identities for so-called Lamperti-stable L\'evy processes. This leads
further to the introduction of a more general family of L\'evy processes which

$T_N=21$ K into an incommensurate helical magnetic structure. Magnetic
fluctuations above $T_N$ are coupled to the crystal lattice as manifested by
negative thermal expansion. Both, the complex magnetic structure and the
anomalous structural behavior can be related to magnetic frustration.
Application of an external magnetic field shifts the ordering temperature and
the regime of negative thermal expansion towards lower temperatures. Thereby,
the spin ordering changes into a conical structure. ZnCr$_2$S$_4$ shows two
magnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=15$ K and $T_{N2}=8$ K that are accompanied by
structural phase transitions. The crystal structure transforms from the cubic
spinel-type (space group $Fd$\={3}$m$) at high temperatures in the paramagnetic
state, via a tetragonally distorted intermediate phase (space group $I4_1$ /
$amd$) for $T_{N2} < T < T_{N1}$ into a low temperature orthorhombic phase
(space group $I m m a$) for $T < T_{N2}$. The cooperative displacement of
sulfur ions by exchange striction is the origin of these structural phase
transitions. The low temperature structure of ZnCr$_2$S$_4$ is identical to the
orthorhombic structure of magnetite below the Verwey transition. When applying

in the intermediate magnetic phase as observed in ZnCr$_2$Se$_4$.

individual stars into binary systems, which we refer to as the pairing

discuss the consequences of each pairing function for the interpretation of

spectral type in a sample. These quantities, when derived from a binary survey
with a mass-limited sample of target stars, are thus not representative for the

problem, whose solutions correspond to conformations satisfying the desired

proposed Monkey Search algorithm. The simplicity of the optimization problem
and the effectiveness of the used meta-heuristic search allowed the simulation
of a large set of high-quality conformations. We show that, even though only

changes in the mean radius, luminosity and surface effective temperature are

pulsation model results, which show that these parameters do indeed vary within
this order of magnitude if the amplitude of the pulsation changes
significantly. We interpret the phase modulation of the pulsation to be a

expects from the detected changes of the mean radius assuming that the
pulsation constant remains the same during the modulation. Our results indicate
that during the modulation the pulsation remains purely radial, and the
underlying mechanism is most probably a periodic perturbation of the stellar
luminosity with the modulation period.

within the framework developed by the author of local pairs and boson-fermion
resonance, arising in the context of negative-U behaviour in an inhomogeneous
electronic environment. The strong inhomogeneity comes with the mixed-valent
condition of these materials, which when underdoped lie in close proximity to
the Mott-Anderson transition. The observed intense scattering is presented as
resulting from pair formation and electron-boson collisions in the resonant
crossover circumstance. The high level of scattering brings the systems to
incoherence in the pseudogapped state, p < pc (= 0.183). In a high magnetic
field the striped partition of the inhomogeneous charge distribution is much
strengthened and regularized. Magnetization and resistance oscillations, of
period dictated by the favoured positioning of the square fluxon array within
the real space environment of the diagonal 2D charge striping array, are
demonstrated to be responsible for the recently reported behaviour hitherto
widely attributed to the quantum oscillation response of a much more standard
Fermi liquid condition. A detailed analysis embracing all the experimental data
serves to indicate that in the given conditions of very high field, low

searches for the effective temperature (T_eff) and pulsational velocity (V_p)

utilising synthetic colours and bolometric corrections from static atmosphere
models. The T_eff and V_p curves are initially derived from empirical relations

and the absolute values of the radius, the effective temperature, the visual
brightness, and the luminosity of individual objects. Distance and mass are
also determined. The method is tested on 9 RRab stars subjected to
Baade-Wesselink analyses earlier by several authors. The physical parameters
derived by our method using only the light curve data of these stars are well
within their possible ranges defined by direct Baade-Wesselink and other

observed $K$-band in the redshift range [0.25-1.25], that are combined with
data from the references in multiple bands and redshifts, to build up the
$K$-band number count distribution. We find that the overall shape of the
number counts can be grouped into three regimes: the classic Euclidean slope
regime ($d\log N/dm\sim0.6$) at bright magnitudes; a transition regime at
intermediate magnitudes, dominated by $M^{\ast}$ galaxies at the redshift that
maximizes the product $\phi^{\ast}\frac{dV_{c}}{d\Omega}$; and an $\alpha$
dominated regime at faint magnitudes, where the slope asymptotically approaches
-0.4($\alpha$+1) controlled by post-$M^{\ast}$ galaxies. The slope of the
$K$-band number counts presents an averaged decrement of $\sim50%$ in the range
$15.5<K<18.5$ ($d\log N/dm\sim0.6-0.30$). The rate of change in the slope is
highly sensitive to cosmic variance effects. The decreasing trend is the
consequence of a prominent decrease of the characteristic density
$\phi^{\ast}_{K,obs}$ ($\sim60%$ from $z=0.5$ to $z=1.5$) and an almost flat
evolution of $M^{\ast}_{K,obs}$ (1$\sigma$ compatible with

also present the salient points of a little-known paper by Levy (2000), that
shows that strong compression can result from the shock wave generated by GC
disk crossing. The main thrust of our paper is a search for remnants of disk
crossings by Globular Clusters. Using the gravitational potential of the Galaxy
to locate the position of the most recent crossings of a subset of fifty-four
Globular Clusters reveals that systematic errors and uncertainties in initial
conditions limit the scope for unequivocal identification. From the subset of
fifty-four, six possible search sites with the best constraints are retained
for further scrutiny. Three of the six potentially promising search areas in
the disk are from Globular Clusters NGC 3201, 6397 and NGC 6838, for which we
cannot rule out some observed star associations observed nearby as being
remnants. The three other of the six areas are too large to provide meaningful
identification of remnants. Also, a possible remnant (open cluster NGC6231) is
shown not to be due to Globular Cluster impact, contrary to a previous report.

both q-KP and q-UC hierarchies. Suitable similarity and periodic reductions of
the hierarchy yield the q-difference Painleve equations of types
$A_{2g+1}^{(1)}$ $(g \geq 1)$, $D_5^{(1)}$, and $E_6^{(1)}$. As its
consequence, a class of algebraic solutions of the q-Painleve equations is
rapidly obtained by means of the universal character. In particular, we
demonstrate explicitly the reduction procedure for the case of type
$E_6^{(1)}$, via the framework of tau-functions based on the geometry of

interhemispheric asymmetry in the remote marine boundary layer (MBL). The
modelled results are examined at the surface and on a series of time-height
cross sections at several locations spread over the Atlantic, the Indian, and
the Pacific Oceans. Comparison of model with surface measurements at remote MBL
stations indicate a close agreement. The most striking feature of the
hemispheric spring ozone maximum in the MBL can be most easily identified at
the NH sites of Westman Island, Bermuda, and Mauna Loa, and at the SH site of
Samoa. Modelled ozone vertical distributions in the troposphere are compared
with ozone profiles. For the Atlantic and the Indian sites, the model generally
produces a hemispheric spring ozone maximum close to those of the measurements.
The model also produces a spring ozone maximum in the northeastern and tropical
north Pacific close to those measurements, and at sites in the NH high
latitudes. The good agreement between model and measurements indicate that the
model can reproduce the proposed mechanisms responsible for producing the
spring ozone maximum in these regions of the MBL, lending confidence in the use
of the model to investigate MBL ozone chemistry (see part 2 and part 3). The
spring ozone maximum in the tropical central south Pacific and eastern
equatorial Pacific are less well reproduced by the model, indicating that both
the transport of $O_3$ precursors from biomass burning emissions taking place
in southeastern Asia, Australia, Oceania, southern Africa, and South America
are not well represented in the model in these regions. Overall, the model
produces a better simulation at sites where the stratosphere and biomass

propagator, or ""damped quantum map"". We obtain analogues of Weyl's laws for
such maps in the semiclassical limit, and draw some more precise estimates when
the classical dynamic is chaotic.

parametric-downconversion as a convenient system to analyze the
quantum-classical transition in the continuous variable regime. We explicitly
evaluate intensity correlations, negativity and entanglement for the system in
a thermal state and show that a hierarchy of nonclassicality thresholds
naturally emerges in terms of thermal and downconversion photon number. We show
that the transition from quantum to classical regime may be tuned by
controlling the intensities of the seeds and detected by intensity
measurements. Besides, we show that the thresholds are not affected by losses,
which only modify the amount of nonclassicality. The multimode case is also
analyzed in some detail.

benefited significantly from increased sensitivity, spatial resolution, and
spectral resolution, e.g., measuring the diameters and asymmetries of single
stars, imaging/fitting the orbits of multiple stars, modeling Be star disks,
and modeling AGN nuclei. Similarly, polarimetry has also yielded excellent
astrophysical results, e.g., characterizing the atmospheres and shells of red
giants/supergiants, modeling the envelopes of AGB stars, studying the
morphology of Be stars, and monitoring the short- and long- term behavior of
AGNs. The next logical evolutionary step in instrumentation is to combine LBOI
with polarimetry, which is called optical interferometric polarimetry (OIP). In
other words, measurements of spatial coherence are performed simultaneously
with measurements of coherence between orthogonal polarization states.

photons, $\gamma^{\star}p \to Xp$, have been obtained with the H1 and ZEUS
detectors at HERA. Different experimental techniques have been used, by
requiring a large rapidity gap between $X$ and the outgoing proton, by
analyzing the mass distribution, $M_X$, of the hadronic final state, as well as
by directly tagging the proton. A reasonable compatibility between those
techniques and between H1 and ZEUS results have been observed. Some common
fundamental features in the measurements are also present in all data sets.
They are detailed in this document. Diffractive PDFs can give a good account of
those features. Ideas and results are discussed in the following.

flexible framework for introducing prior information complementary to the
measured data. This prior information is often qualitative in nature, making
the translation of the available information into a computational model a
challenging task. We propose a generalized gamma family of hyperpriors which
allows the impressed currents to be focal and we advocate a fast and efficient
iterative algorithm, the Iterative Alternating Sequential (IAS) algorithm for
computing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Furthermore, we show that for
particular choices of the scalar parameters specifying the hyperprior, the
algorithm effectively approximates popular regularization strategies such as
the Minimum Current Estimate and the Minimum Support Estimate. The connection
between priorconditioning and adaptive regularization methods is also pointed
out. The posterior densities are explored by means of a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) strategy suitable for this family of hypermodels. The computed
experiments suggest that the known preference of regularization methods for
superficial sources over deep sources is a property of the MAP estimators only,
and that estimation of the posterior mean in the hierarchical model is better
adapted for localizing deep sources.
