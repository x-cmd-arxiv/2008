Calabi-Yau orientifolds is computed by performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction. The
N=1 Kaehler potential, the superpotential, the gauge-kinetic coupling function
and the D-terms are derived in terms of the geometric data of the internal
space and of the two-cycle wrapped by the D5-brane. In particular, we obtain
the D5-brane and flux superpotential by integrating out four-dimensional
three-forms which couple via the Chern-Simons action. Also the infinitesimal
complex structure deformations of the two-cycle induced by the deformations of
the ambient space contribute to the F-terms. The superpotential can be
expressed in terms of relative periods depending on both the open and closed
moduli. To analyze this dependence we blow up along the two-cycle and obtain a
rigid divisor in an auxiliary compact threefold with negative first Chern
class. The variation of the mixed Hodge structure on this blown-up geometry is
equivalent to the original deformation problem and can be analyzed by
Picard-Fuchs equations. We exemplify the blow-up procedure for a non-compact
Calabi-Yau threefold given by the canonical bundle over del Pezzo surfaces.

in different regimes of the short-distance 't Hooft coupling, lambda. The
mesons in the small lambda limit should have a Regge spectrum in order to agree
with perturbation theory, while generically the large lambda theories with
gravity duals produce spectra reminiscent of KK modes. We argue that these
KK-like states are qualitatively different from QCD modes: they are deeply
bound states which are sensitive to short distance interactions rather than the
flux tube-like states expected in asymptotically free, confining gauge
theories. In addition, we also find that the characteristic event shapes for
the large lambda theories with gravity duals are close to spherical, very
different from QCD-like (small lambda, small N) and Nambu-Goto-like (small
lambda, large N) theories which have jets. This observation is in agreement
with the conjecture of Strassler on event shapes in large 't Hooft coupling
theories, which was recently proved by Hofman and Maldacena for the conformal
case. This conclusion does not change even when considering soft-wall
backgrounds in the gravity dual. The picture that emerges is the following:
theories with small and large lambda are qualitatively different, while
theories with small and large N are qualitatively similar. Thus it seems that
it is the relative smallness of the 't Hooft coupling in QCD that prevents a
reliable AdS/QCD correspondence from emerging, and that reproducing
characteristic QCD-like behavior will require genuine stringy dynamics to be
incorporated into any putative dual theory.

restricted three--body analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the
expected collision rates between giants and black holes, and between giants and

plausibly explain the missing giants in the $10.5<K<12$ band. However,
depleting the brighter ($K<10.5$) objects out to the required radius would
require a large population of black hole impactors which would in turn deplete

inferred gravity of dark matter at any radius and the enclosed baryonic mass, a
relation summarized by Milgrom's law of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND).
However, present-day covariant versions of MOND usually require some additional
fields contributing to the geometry, as well as an additional hot dark matter
component to explain cluster dynamics and cosmology. Here, we envisage a
slightly more mundane explanation, suggesting that dark matter does exist but
is the source of MOND-like phenomenology in galaxies. We assume a canonical
action for dark matter, but also add an interaction term between baryonic
matter, gravity, and dark matter, such that standard matter effectively obeys
the MOND field equation in galaxies. We show that even the simplest realization
of the framework leads to a model which reproduces some phenomenological
predictions of cold dark matter (CDM) and MOND at those scales where these are
most successful. We also devise a more general form of the interaction term,
introducing the medium density as a new order parameter. This allows for new
physical effects which should be amenable to observational tests in the near
future. Hence, this very general framework, which can be furthermore related to
a generalized scalar-tensor theory, opens the way to a possible unification of
the successes of CDM and MOND at different scales.

conclusion is drawn by comparing molecular dynamics simulations at constant

Markov process. The main advantage of the graph representation is that its
dynamics can be naturally renormalized by collecting nodes into ""hubs"", while
redefining their connectivity. We show that both topological and dynamical
properties are preserved by the renormalization procedure. Moreover, we obtain
clear indications that the heteropolymers exhibit common topological
properties, at variance with the homopolymer, whose peculiar graph structure
stems from its spatial homogeneity. In order to obtain a clear distinction
between a ""fast folder"" and a ""slow folder"" in the heteropolymers one has to
look at kinetic features of the directed graph. We find that the average time
needed to the fast folder for reaching its native configuration is two orders
of magnitude smaller than its equilibration time, while for the bad folder
these time scales are comparable. Accordingly, we can conclude that the

observed, revealing the occurrence of a place exchange mechanism. Substitution
seems to play a fundamental role in the nucleation process, forming aggregation
centers for incoming atoms and thus leading to the ordered growth of Pd islands
on Au(111). Atomically resolved STM images of Pd islands reveal a close-packed
arrangement with lattice parameter close to the interatomic distance between
gold atoms in the fcc regions of the Au(111) surface. Distortion of the

  Our rank bound significantly improves (dependence on k exponentially reduced)

factorization pattern of nonzero depth-3 circuits, most strikingly: the rank of
linear factors of a simple, minimal and nonzero depth-3 circuit (over any

  The novel feature of this work is a new notion of maps between sets of linear

This results in dense traffic of RNA polymerases (RNAP). We developed a
stochastic model, integrating results of single-molecule and quantitative in
vivo studies of E. coli, to evaluate the quantitative effect of pausing,
termination, and antitermination on rRNA transcription. Our calculations reveal
that in dense RNAP traffic, spontaneous pausing of RNAP can lead to severe
""traffic jams"", as manifested in the broad distribution of inter-RNAP distances
and can be a major factor limiting transcription and hence growth. Our results
suggest the suppression of these pauses by the ribosomal antitermination
complex to be essential at fast growth. Moreover, unsuppressed pausing by even
a few non-antiterminated RNAPs can already reduce transcription drastically
under dense traffic. However, the termination factor Rho can remove the
non-antiterminated RNAPs and restore fast transcription. The results thus
suggest an intriguing role by Rho to enhance rather than attenuate rRNA
transcription.

monitoring the fluctuations of correlation and susceptibility, coarse-grained

correlations (C) and susceptibilities (Chi) in models where no quenched
disorder is present. Our focus for the spherical model is on coarse-graining
over the whole volume of $N$ spins, which requires accounting for N^{-1/2}
non-Gaussian fluctuations of the spin. The latter are treated as a perturbation
about the leading order Gaussian statistics. We obtain exact results for these
quantities, which enable us to characterise the joint distribution of C and Chi
fluctuations. We find that this distribution is qualitatively different, even
for equilibrium above criticality, from the spin-glass scenario where C and Chi
fluctuations are linked in a manner akin to the fluctuation-dissipation
relation between the average C and Chi. Our results show that coarsening at
criticality is clearly heterogeneous for d>4 and suggest that, as in other
glassy systems, there is a well-defined timescale on which fluctuations across
thermal histories are largest. Surprisingly, however, neither this timescale
nor the amplitude of the heterogeneities increase with the age of the system,
as would be expected from the growing correlation length. For d<4, the strength
of the fluctuations varies on a timescale proportional to the age of the
system; the corresponding amplitude also grows with age, but does not scale
with the correlation volume as might have been expected naively.

discussed the impact of the f.o. dynamics looking at two different procedures:
switching-off the collisions when the energy density goes below a fixed value

phase to a hadronic one. We address the relation between the scaling of
$v_2(p_T)$ with the eccentricity $\epsilon_x$ and with the integrated elliptic
flow. We show that the breaking of the $v_2(p_T)/\epsilon_x$ scaling is not
coming mainly from the finite $\eta/s$ but from the f.o. dynamics and that the
$v_2(p_T)$ is weakly dependent on the f.o. scheme. On the other hand the
$v_4(p_T)$ is found to be much more dependent on both the $\eta/s$ and the f.o.
dynamics and hence is indicated to put better constraints on the properties of
the QGP. A first semi-quantitative analysis show that both $v_2$ and $v_4$

explosion, we observed at 22 and 8.4 GHz, and at our second, at t = 133 days,
at 8.4 and 5.0 GHz. The VLBI observations allow us to accurately measure the
source's size and position at each epoch, and thus constrain its expansion
velocity and proper motion. We find the source at best marginally resolved at
both epochs, allowing us to place a 3sigma upper limit of ~0.75c on the
expansion velocity of a circular source. For an elongated source, our
measurements are compatible with mildly relativistic expansion. However, our
3sigma upper limit on the proper motion is 4 micro-arcsec/day, corresponding to
an apparent velocity of <0.6c, and is consistent with a stationary flux
centroid. This limit rules out a relativistic jet such as an gamma-ray burst
jet away from the line of sight, which would be expected to show apparent
proper motion of >c. Taken together, our measurements argue against the
presence of any long-lived relativistic outflow in SN 2008D. On the other hand,
our measurements are consistent with the nonrelativistic expansion velocities
of <30,000 km/s and small proper motions (<500 km/s) seen in typical
supernovae.

information bottleneck (IB) method is formulated within the ambit of the
generalized nonadditive statistics of Tsallis. Given a nonadditivity parameter
$ q $, the role of the \textit{additive duality} of nonadditive statistics ($
q^*=2-q $) in relating Tsallis entropies for ranges of the nonadditivity
parameter $ q < 1 $ and $ q > 1 $ is described. Defining $ X $, $ \tilde X $,
and $ Y $ to be the source alphabet, the compressed reproduction alphabet, and,
the \textit{relevance variable} respectively, it is demonstrated that
minimization of a generalized IB (gIB) Lagrangian defined in terms of the
nonadditivity parameter $ q^* $ self-consistently yields the
\textit{nonadditive effective distortion measure} to be the \textit{$ q
$-deformed} generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence: $
D_{K-L}^{q}[p(Y|X)||p(Y|\tilde X)] $. This result is achieved without enforcing
any \textit{a-priori} assumptions. Next, it is proven that the $q^*-deformed $
nonadditive free energy of the system is non-negative and convex. Finally, the
update equations for the gIB method are derived. These results generalize
critical features of the IB method to the case of Tsallis statistics.

ranking of nodes, monitoring, event region detection, collaborative filtering,
collaborative signal processing, {\em etc.}, can be formulated as a problem of
solving a linear system of equations. Several recent works propose different
distributed algorithms for solving these problems, usually by using linear
iterative numerical methods.
  In this work, we extend the settings of the above approaches, by adding
another dimension to the problem. Specifically, we are interested in {\em
self-stabilizing} algorithms, that continuously run and converge to a solution
from any initial state. This aspect of the problem is highly important due to
the dynamic nature of the network and the frequent changes in the measured
environment.
  In this paper, we link together algorithms from two different domains. On the
one hand, we use the rich linear algebra literature of linear iterative methods
for solving systems of linear equations, which are naturally distributed with
rapid convergence properties. On the other hand, we are interested in
self-stabilizing algorithms, where the input to the computation is constantly
changing, and we would like the algorithms to converge from any initial state.
We propose a simple novel method called \syncAlg as a self-stabilizing variant
of the linear iterative methods. We prove that under mild conditions the
self-stabilizing algorithm converges to a desired result. We further extend
these results to handle the asynchronous case.
  As a case study, we discuss the sensor calibration problem and provide
simulation results to support the applicability of our approach.

fluctuations between dressed states belonging to the same manifold. Such
low-frequency transitions could be ignored in a closed cavity, but the cavity
employed in the experiment was open, which justifies our assumption. The cavity
quality factor corresponding to the data is $Q=3.31\cdot 10^{10}$, whereas $Q$
reported in the experiment was $Q=7\cdot 10^7$. The rate of decoherence arising
from opening of the cavity can be of the same order as an analogous correction
coming from finite time resolution $\Delta t$ (formally equivalent to
collisional decoherence). Peres-Horodecki separability criterion shows that the
rate at which the atom-field state approaches a separable state is controlled
by fluctuations between dressed states from the same manifold, and not by the
rate of transitions towards the ground state. In consequence, improving the $Q$

superconductors with periodic pinning arrays, the transport in two
perpendicular directions can be anisotropic. The degree of the anisotropy
varies as a function of field due to the fact that the interstitial vortex
lattice has distinct orderings at different matching fields. The anisotropy is
most pronounced at the matching fields but persists at incommensurate fields,
and it is most prominent for triangular, honeycomb, and kagome pinning arrays.
Square pinning arrays can also show anisotropic transport at certain fields in
spite of the fact that the perpendicular directions of the square pinning array
are identical. We show that the anisotropy results from distinct vortex
dynamical states and that although the critical depinning force may be lower in
one direction, the vortex velocity above depinning may also be lower in the
same direction for ranges of external drives where both directions are
depinned. For honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the anisotropy can show
multiple reversals as a function of field. We argue that when the pinning sites
can be multiply occupied such that no interstitial vortices are present, the
anisotropy is strongly reduced or absent.

$H$-band spectra of two Red Supergiants in the GC (IRS~7 and VR~5-7), and in
combination with spectral synthesis we derive abundances for Fe and C, as well
as other $\alpha$-elements Ca, Si, Mg Ti and O. We find that the C-depletion in
VR~5-7 is consistent with the predictions of evolutionary models of RSGs, while
the heavy depletion of C and O in IRS~7's atmosphere is indicative of deep
mixing, possibly due to fast initial rotation and/or enhanced mass-loss. Our
results indicate that the {\it current} surface Fe/H content of each star is
slightly above Solar. However, comparisons to evolutionary models indicate that
the {\it initial} Fe/H ratio was likely closer to Solar, and has been driven
higher by H-depletion at the stars' surface. Overall, we find $\alpha$/Fe
ratios for both stars which are consistent with the thin Galactic disk. These
results are consistent with other chemical studies of the GC, given the
precision to which abundances can currently be determined. We argue that the GC
abundances are consistent with a scenario in which the recent star-forming
activity in the GC was fuelled by either material travelling down the Bar from
the inner disk, or from the winds of stars in the inner Bulge -- with no need
to invoke top-heavy stellar Initial Mass Functions to explain anomalous
abundance ratios.

supersymmetry breaking mediation mechanism. It is the result of renormalization
group scaling from approximately conformal strong dynamics in the hidden

dynamics which suppresses scalar soft masses and the B_mu term also drives the
Higgs soft masses to -|mu|^2. Thus the supersymmetric contribution to the Higgs
mass matrix from the mu-term is exactly canceled by the soft masses. Scalar
sequestering has two tell-tale predictions for the superpartner spectrum in
addition to the usual gaugino mediation predictions: Higgsinos are much heavier
(mu > TeV) than scalar Higgses (m_A ~ few hundred GeV), and third generation
scalar masses are enhanced because of new positive contributions from Higgs

have a long history. The ultimate goal is to find exponential separations for
computational problems. However, such separations do not come a dime a dozen:
while there were some early successes in the form of hidden subgroup problems
for abelian groups--which generalize Shor's factoring algorithm perhaps most
faithfully--only for a handful of non-abelian groups efficient quantum
algorithms were found. Recently, problems have gotten increased attention that
seek to identify hidden sub-structures of other combinatorial and algebraic
objects besides groups. In this paper we provide new examples for exponential
separations by considering hidden shift problems that are defined for several
classes of highly non-linear Boolean functions. These so-called bent functions
arise in cryptography, where their property of having perfectly flat Fourier
spectra on the Boolean hypercube gives them resilience against certain types of
attack. We present new quantum algorithms that solve the hidden shift problems
for several well-known classes of bent functions in polynomial time and with a
constant number of queries, while the classical query complexity is shown to be
exponential. Our approach uses a technique that exploits the duality between
bent functions and their Fourier transforms.

evidence of rotating disks and their respective symmetry axes in T Tauri stars.
Methods: We used the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter along with the Eucalyptus-IFU
to obtain spectropolarimetric measurements of the T Tauri stars RY Tau (two
epochs) and PX Vul (one epoch). Evidence of line effects showing a loop on the
Q-U diagram favors a compact rather than an extended source for the line
photons in a rotating disk. In addition, the polarization position angle (PA)
obtained using the line effect can constrain the symmetry axis of the disk.
Results: RY Tau shown a variable Halpha double peak on 2004-2005 data.
Polarization line effect is evident on the Q-U diagram for both epochs
confirming a clockwise rotating disk. A single loop is evident on 2004 changing
to a linear excursion plus a loop on 2005. Interestingly, the intrinsic PA
calculated using the line effect is consistent between our two epochs
(~167deg). An alternative intrinsic PA computed from the interstellar
polarization corrected continuum and averaged between 2001-2005 yielded a PA
137deg. This last value is closer to be perpendicular to the observed disk
direction (~25deg) as expected by single scattering in an optically thin disk.
For PX Vul, we detected spectral variability in Halpha along with non-variable
continuum polarization when compared with previous data. The Q-U diagram shows
a well-defined loop in Halpha associated to a counter-clockwise rotating disk.
The symmetry axis inferred by the line effect has a PA~91deg (with an ambiguity
of 90deg). Our results confirm previous evidence that the emission line in T
Tauri stars has its origin in a compact source scattered off a rotating
accretion disk.

massless particles in four dimensions, like BCFW recursion relations, the
question of how much structure of the S-matrix can be determined from purely
S-matrix arguments has received new attention. The BCFW recursion relations for
massless particles of spin 1 and 2 imply that the whole tree-level S-matrix can
be determined in terms of three-particle amplitudes (evaluated at complex
momenta). However, the known proofs of the validity of the relations rely on
the Lagrangian of the theory, either by using Feynman diagrams explicitly or by
studying the effective theory at large complex momenta. This means that a
purely S-matrix theoretic proof of the relations is still missing. The aim of
this paper is to provide such a proof for spin 1 particles by extending the
four-particle test introduced by P. Benincasa and F. Cachazo in
arXiv:0705.4305[hep-th] to all particles. We show how n-particle tests imply
that the rational function built from the BCFW recursion relations possesses
all the correct factorization channels including holomorphic and
anti-holomorphic collinear limits. This in turn implies that they give the

this work provides a bias free, low dispersion photometric redshift catalog,
that we have criteria at hand to select a 'robust' subsample with fewer

obtained with a variety of techniques, has become more and more widespread.
Giving access to galaxies with a wide range of luminosities out to high
redshifts, these surveys include many faint galaxies with significantly
sub-solar metallicities.
  We use our chemically consistent galaxy evolutionary synthesis code GALEV to
produce a large grid of template Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) for
galaxies of spectral types E and Sa through Sd - one accounting in a chemically
consistent way for the increasing initial metallicities of successive stellar
generations, the other one for exclusively solar metallicities - for

  We use our new photometric redshift code GAZELLE based on the comparison of
observed and model SEDs. Comparing the photometric redshifts obtained using
solar metallicity templates when working on a catalogue of artificially created
chemically consistent SEDs, typical for low-metallicity local late-type
galaxies and for intrinsically low-luminosity, and hence low-metallicity,

from this metallicity mismatch. This bias consists in a systematic
underestimate of the photometric redshift by typically Delta z ~ 0.1 ... 0.2
until z ~ 1.2, depending on galaxy type, of distant, faint and low-metallicity
galaxies if analysed with solar-metallicity templates.

this extension of the SECD machine, using a series of elementary
transformations (transformation into continu-ation-passing style (CPS) and

theorem is usually assumed to be equal to the gravitational energy, since the
contribution to the gravitational force from the mass distribution outside the
volume of integration is assumed to be negligible. Such approximation may not
be valid in the presence of an important external net potential. In the present
work we analyze the effect of an external gravitational field on the
gravitational budget of a density structure. Our cases under analysis are (a) a
giant molecular cloud (GMC) with different aspect ratios embedded within a
galactic net potential, and (b) a molecular cloud core embedded within the
gravitational potential of its parent molecular cloud. We find that for
roundish GMCs, the tidal tearing due to the shear in the plane of the galaxy is
compensated by the tidal compression in the z direction. The influence of the
external effective potential on the total gravitational budget of these clouds
is relatively small, although not necessarily negligible. However, for more
filamentary GMCs, the external effective potential can be dominant and can even
overwhelm self-gravity, regardless of whether its main effect on the cloud is
to disrupt it or compress it. This may explain the presence of some GMCs with
few or no signs of massive star formation, such as the Taurus or the
Maddalena's clouds. In the case of dense cores embedded in their parent
molecular cloud, we found that the gravitational content due to the external
field may be more important than the gravitational energy of the cores
themselves. This effect works in the same direction as the gravitational
energy, i.e., favoring the collapse of cores. We speculate on the implications
of these results for star formation models.

transport in double-dot devices grown using methane with the natural abundance

pebbles at a dollar a piece, and hands them to an adversary who distributes
them among the vertices of G (called a configuration) and chooses a target
vertex r. The player may make a pebbling move by taking two pebbles off of one
vertex and moving one pebble to a neighboring vertex. The player wins the game
if he can move k pebbles to r. The value of the game (G,k), called the
k-pebbling number of G, is the minimum cost to the player to guarantee a win.
That is, it is the smallest positive integer m of pebbles so that, from every
configuration of size m, one can move k pebbles to any target. In this paper,
we use the block structure of graphs to investigate pebbling numbers, and we
present the exact pebbling number of the graphs whose blocks are complete. We
also provide an upper bound for the k-pebbling number of diameter-two graphs,
which can be the basis for further investigation into the pebbling numbers of
graphs with blocks that have diameter at most two.

contact with a heat bath exhibits some radical differences from the traditional
statistical mechanics of undriven systems. In Floquet systems all quasienergies
can be placed in a finite frequency interval, and the number of near
degeneracies in this interval grows without limit as the dimension N of the
Hilbert space increases. This leads to pathologies, including drastic changes
in the Floquet states, as N increases. In earlier work these difficulties were
put aside by fixing N, while taking the coupling to the bath to be smaller than
any quasienergy difference. This led to a simple explicit theory for the
reduced density matrix, but with some major differences from the usual time
independent statistical mechanics. We show that, for weak but finite coupling
between system and heat bath, the accuracy of a calculation within the
truncated Hilbert space spanned by the N lowest energy eigenstates of the
undriven system is limited, as N increases indefinitely, only by the usual
neglect of bath memory effects within the Born and Markov approximations. As we
seek higher accuracy by increasing N, we inevitably encounter quasienergy
differences smaller than the system-bath coupling. We therefore derive the
steady state reduced density matrix without restriction on the size of
quasienergy splittings. In general, it is no longer diagonal in the Floquet
states. We analyze, in particular, the behavior near a weakly avoided crossing,
where quasienergy near degeneracies routinely appear. The explicit form of our
results for the denisty matrix gives a consistent prescription for the
statistical mechanics for many periodically driven systems with N infinite, in
spite of the Floquet state pathologies.

that usually used in the similar previous studies. These AGNs are mainly
complied from the RXTE All Sky Survey (XSS), and complemented by the released
INTEGRAL AGN catalog. The black hole masses, bolometric luminosities of AGN,
and Eddington ratios are derived from their optical spectra in terms of the
broad H$\beta$ emission line. The tight correlation between the hard X-ray
(3-20keV) and bolometric/line luminosity is well identified in our sample. Also
identified is a strong inverse Baldwin relationship of the H$\beta$ emission
line. In addition, all these hard X-ray AGNs are biased toward luminous objects
with high Eddington ratio (mostly between 0.01 to 0.1) and low column density
($<10^{22} \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$), which is most likely due to the selection effect
of the surveys. The hard X-ray luminosity is consequently found to be strongly
correlated with the black hole mass. We believe the sample completeness will be
improved in the next few years by the ongoing Swift and INTEGRAL missions, and
by the next advanced missions, such as NuSTAR, Simbol-X, and NeXT. Finally, the
correlation between RFe (=optical FeII/H$\beta$) and disk temperature as
assessed by $T\propto (L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}})M_{\mathrm{BH}}^{-1}$ leads us to
suggest that the strength of the FeII emission is mainly determined by the

modified differently by the impurity. If the multi-electron scalar product
(MESP) between the occupied spin-up and down states approaches zero then this
defines an orthogonality catastrophe. In the present paper the MESP is
investigated for the FAIR (Friedel Artificial Iserted Resonance) solution for a
Friedel-Anderson impurity. A basis of Wilson states is used. The MESP is
numerically determined for the (enforced) magnetic, the singlet, and the
triplet states as a function of the number N of Wilson states. The magnetic and
the triplet state show an exponentially decreasing MESP as a function of N.
Surprisingly it is not the number of states which causes this decrease. It is
instead the energy separation of the highest occupied state from the Fermi
energy which determines the reduction of the MESP. In the singlet state the
ground-state requires a finite MESP to optimize its energy. As a consequence
there is no orthogonality catastrophe. The MESP approaches a saturation value

an approach of quantum optics. After introducing a damping factor for the
lifetime $\tau$ of quasiparticles, the superconducting dome is naturally
produced, and the pseudogap is the consequence of pairing with damped
coherence. We derive a new expression of Ginzburg-Landau free energy density,
in which a six-order term due to decoherence damping effect is included.
Without invoking any microscopic pairing mechanism, this approach provides a
simple universal equation of second-order phase transition, which can be
reduced to two well-known empirical scaling equations: the superconducting dome
Presland-Tallon equation, and the normal-state pseudogap crossover temperature
$T^{*}$ line.

abelian group G and the other by the root lattice of a finite irreducible root

BC_r, which we call a unitary Lie G-torus, as it is a special unitary Lie
algebra of a nondegenerate G-graded hermitian form of Witt index r over an
associative torus with involution. We prove a structure theorem for centreless
Lie G-tori of type BC_r, r \geq 3, that states that any such Lie torus is
bi-isomorphic to a unitary Lie G-torus, and we determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for two unitary Lie G-tori to be bi-isomorphic. The
motivation to investigate Lie G-tori came from the theory of extended affine
Lie algebras, which are natural generalizations of the affine and toroidal Lie
algebras. Every extended affine Lie algebra possesses an ideal which is a Lie
n-torus of type X_r for some irreducible root system X_r, where by an n-torus
we mean that the group G is a free abelian group of rank n for some n \geq 0.
The structure theorem above enables us to classify centreless Lie n-tori of
type BC_r, r \geq 3. We show that they are determined by pairs consisting of a
quadratic form K on an n-dimensional Z_2-vector space and of an orbit of the
orthogonal group of K. We use that result to construct extended affine Lie
algebras of type BC_r, r \geq 3. Our article completes a large project
involving many earlier papers and many authors to determine the centreless Lie
n-tori of all types.

paper investigates the characteristics of network topologies that maintain a

network topologies belonging to the main network models and some real world

degree nodes, and high betweenness nodes. We use elasticity as our robustness
measure and, through our analysis, illustrate that different topologies can
have different degrees of robustness. In particular, elasticity can fall as low
as 0.8% of the upper bound based on the attack employed. This result
substantiates the need for optimized network topology design. Furthermore, we
implement a tradeoff function that combines elasticity under the three attack
strategies and considers the cost of the network. Our extensive simulations
show that, for a given network density, regular and semi-regular topologies can
have higher degrees of robustness than heterogeneous topologies, and that link
redundancy is a sufficient but not necessary condition for robustness.

transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which good data are available. The
input quantities for each system are the results of the light curve analyses
(Paper 1), and published measurements of the stellar velocity amplitude, Teff
and [Fe/H]. The physical properties are determined by interpolating within
tabulated predictions from stellar theory. Statistical uncertainties are found
using a perturbation algorithm, which gives a detailed error budget for every
output quantity. Systematic uncertainties are assessed for each quantity by
comparing the values found using different stellar models. As a theory-free
alternative, physical properties are also calculated using an empirical
mass-radius relation constructed using low-mass eclipsing binary stars. The
properties of the planets depend mostly on parameters measured from the light
and velocity curves, and have only a minor sensitivity to theoretical
predictions. In contrast, the orbital semimajor axes and stellar masses have a
strong dependence on theoretical predictions, and their systematic
uncertainties can be substantially larger than the statistical ones. Using the
empirical mass--radius relation instead, their values are smaller by up to 15%.
Thus our understanding of extrasolar planets is currently limited by our lack
of understanding of low-mass stars. Using all known transiting planets, I find
that correlations between their orbital periods, masses and surface gravities
are significant at the 2-3 sigma level. However, the separation of the known
planets into two classes according to their Safronov number is weaker than
previously found, and may not be statistically significant (abridged).

show that the off-center bar can be formed if the LMC with an already existing
bar can collide with a low-mass Galactic subhalo as massive as 5 * 10^8 M_sun
(corresponding roughly to a few % of the LMC mass). The simulated stellar
distribution after the collision appears to show an ``off-center bar'', not
because the center of the bar significantly deviates from the dynamical center
of the LMC, but because the underlying stellar distribution of the disk is
significantly asymmetric with respect to the center of the bar. We discuss
whether off-center bars observed in Magellanic-type dwarf galaxies can be
formed as a result of tidal interaction with low-mass halos with no or little

concentration and the kinetic rates of the intermediate processes. The mean
product flux V=d<n>/dt (or ""dose-response"" curve) and the Fano factor

flux can often appear the same for different reaction types, the Fano factor
can be quite different. This suggests both qualitative and quantitative ways to
discriminate between different reaction schemes, and we explore this
possibility in the context of four sample multistep enzymatic reactions. We
argue that measuring both the mean flux and the Fano factor can not only
discriminate between reaction types, but can also provide some detailed
information about the internal, unobserved kinetic rates, and this can be done
without measuring single-molecule transition events.

network are described by physical models such as the signal-to-interference &
noise ratio (SINR) model. For a collection of simultaneously transmitting
stations in the plane, it is possible to identify a reception zone for each
station, consisting of the points where its transmission is received correctly.
The resulting SINR diagram partitions the plane into a reception zone per
station and the remaining plane where no station can be heard.
  SINR diagrams appear to be fundamental to understanding the behavior of
wireless networks, and may play a key role in the development of suitable
algorithms for such networks, analogous perhaps to the role played by Voronoi
diagrams in the study of proximity queries and related issues in computational
geometry. So far, however, the properties of SINR diagrams have not been
studied systematically, and most algorithmic studies in wireless networking
rely on simplified graph-based models such as the unit disk graph (UDG) model,
which conveniently abstract away interference-related complications, and make
it easier to handle algorithmic issues, but consequently fail to capture
accurately some important aspects of wireless networks.
  The current paper focuses on obtaining some basic understanding of SINR
diagrams, their properties and their usability in algorithmic applications.
Specifically, based on some algebraic properties of the polynomials defining
the reception zones we show that assuming uniform power transmissions, the
reception zones are convex and relatively well-rounded. These results are then
used to develop an efficient approximation algorithm for a fundamental point
location problem in wireless networks.

illustrate that distributions of projected stellar radii are very sensitive to
ages and age dispersions between 1 and 10 Myr which, unlike age estimates from
conventional Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, are relatively immune to
uncertainties due to extinction, variability, distance etc. Application of the
technique to the Orion Nebula cluster reveals radius spreads of a factor of
2--3 (FWHM) at a given effective temperature. Modelling this dispersion as an
age spread suggests that PMS stars in the ONC have an age range larger than the
mean cluster age, that could be reasonably described by the age distribution
deduced from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These radius/age spreads are
certainly large enough to invalidate the assumption of coevality when
considering the evolution of PMS properties (rotation, disks etc.) from one
young cluster to another.

screening out the star which has remained embedded in this expanding high

the morphology of the circumstellar dust in order to investigate the hypothesis
that Sakurai's Object is surrounded by a thick spherical envelope of dust. We
have obtained unprecedented, high-angular resolution spectro-interferometric
observations, taken with the mid-IR interferometer MIDI/VLTI, which resolve the

compact (30 x 40 milliarcsec, 105 x 140 AU assuming a distance of 3.5 kpc),

of a stratified disk to constrain its geometric and physical parameters,
although such a model is only a rough approximation of the rapidly evolving
dust structure. Even though the fits are not fully satisfactory, some useful
and robust constraints can be inferred. The disk inclination is estimated to be
75+/-3 degree with a large scale height of 47+/-7 AU. The dust mass of the disk
is estimated to be 6 10^{-5} solar mass. The major axis of the disk (132+/-3

The unbiased distributions obtained clearly show the predominence of X-ray

membranes (DMPC, DPPC, DMPG, DMPS, and DMPSH) with focus on the thermal
equilibrium fluctuations of volume, energy, area, thickness, and chain order.
At constant temperature and pressure, volume and energy exhibit strong
correlations of their slow fluctuations (defined by averaging over 0.5
nanosecond). These quantities, on the other hand, do not correlate
significantly with area, thickness, or chain order. The correlations are mainly
reported for the fluid phase, but we also give some results for the ordered
(gel) phase of two membranes, showing a similar picture. The cause of the
observed strong correlations is identified by splitting volume and energy into
contributions from tails, heads, and water, and showing that the slow
volume-energy fluctuations derive from van der Waals interactions of the tail
region; they are thus analogous to the similar strong correlations recently
observed in computer simulations of the Lennard-Jones and other simple van der
Waals type liquids [U. R. Pedersen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 015701].

take part in any subsequent collisions as well as radiate due to synchrotron

proposed as a source of entangled photon pairs [R. Johne et al., Phys. Rev.

states can be used to overcome the natural splitting between the exciton states
coupled to the horizontally and vertically polarized light modes, so that high
degrees of entanglement can be expected. We investigate theoretically the
features of realistic dot-cavity systems, including the effect of the different
oscillator strength of excitons resonances coupled to the different
polarizations of light. We show that in this case, an independent adjustment of
the cavity resonances is needed in order to keep a high entanglement degree. We
also consider the case when the biexciton-exciton transition is also strongly
coupled to a cavity mode. We show that a very fast emission rate can be
achieved allowing the repetition rates in the THz range. Such fast emission
should however be paid for by a very complex tuning of the many strongly
coupled resonances involved and by a loss of quantum efficiency. Altogether a
strongly coupled dot-cavity system seems to be very promising as a source of
entangled photon pairs.

approach to formulate the linear conductance of the graphene waveguide in terms
of the structure parameters and the incident electron energy. In comparison
with the tight-binding calculation, we find that the generalized transfer

calculated conductance spectrum indicates that the graphene waveguide exhibits
a well-defined insulating band around the Dirac point, even though all the
constituent ribbon segments are gapless. We attribute the occurrence of the
insulating band to the antiresonance effect which is intimately associated with
the edge states localized at the shoulder regions of the junctions.
Furthermore, such an insulating band can be sensitively shifted by a gate
voltage, which suggests a device application of the graphene waveguide as an

described by the steady-state shock model are reviewed and discussed. It is
found that, at least in some of the contexts in which the steady-state model is
used, the steady-state assumption cannot be satisfied. Moreover, the main
result of the present work is that even if the assumptions on steadiness and on
the geometry are fully satisfied, serious limitations in the application of the
model are found: (i) in the absence of down-stream boundary conditions the
model is not related to the physical process(es) that originate the shock, (ii)
matter shocked during the presumed phase of steadiness of the shock is not
hydrodynamically interacting with previously shocked matter, and (iii) the
steady-state model assumes that the flow is stable against perturbations.
Furthermore, even if boundary conditions were assumed, the link between the
steady model and the astrophysical context would not be strictly speaking the
correct HD link. Time-dependent HD computations in different astrophysical
contexts (e.g. SNRs and molecular shocks) show that the steady-state
approximation is inadequate to describe these post-shock structures. Based on
the HD limitations of the steady-state model, it is advised that the model be
used to describe post-shock structures only in those astrophysical contexts
where full time-dependent HD models have already positively tested the
steadiness of the flow. Alternatively, it is suggested to replace the
steady-state model either with time-dependent HD models, or with less
problematic approximations.

anterior-posterior axis. The PAR proteins form complementary anterior and
posterior domains in a dynamic process driven by cytoskeletal rearrangement.
Initially, the PAR proteins are uniformly distributed throughout the embryo.
Following a cue from fertilization, cortical actomyosin contracts towards the
anterior pole. PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 (the anterior PAR proteins) become restricted
to the anterior cortex. PAR-1 and PAR-2 (the posterior PAR proteins) become
enriched in the posterior cortical region. We present a mathematical model of
this polarity establishment process, in which we take a novel approach to
combine reaction-diffusion dynamics of the PAR proteins coupled to a simple
model of actomyosin contraction. We show that known interactions between the
PAR proteins are sufficient to explain many aspects of the observed cortical
PAR dynamics in both wild-type and mutant embryos. However, cytoplasmic PAR
protein polarity, which is vital for generating daughter cells with distinct
molecular components, cannot be properly explained within such a framework. We
therefore consider additional mechanisms that can reproduce the proper
cytoplasmic polarity. In particular we predict that cytoskeletal asymmetry in
the cytoplasm, in addition to the cortical actomyosin asymmetry, is a critical
determinant of PAR protein localization.

stochastically driven pulsation is challenging, more so, if one demands that
realistic error estimates be given for all model fitting parameters. As has
been shown by other authors, the traditional method of fitting Lorentzian
profiles to the power spectrum of time-resolved photometric or spectroscopic
data via the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) procedure delivers good
approximations for these quantities. We, however, show that a conservative
Bayesian approach allows one to treat the detection of modes with minimal
assumptions (i.e., about the existence and identity of the modes).
  Methods. We derive a conservative Bayesian treatment for the probability of
Lorentzian profiles being present in a power spectrum and describe an efficient
implementation that evaluates the probability density distribution of
parameters by using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.
  Results. Potentially superior to ""best-fit"" procedure like MLE, which only
provides formal uncertainties, our method samples and approximates the actual
probability distributions for all parameters involved. Moreover, it avoids
shortcomings that make the MLE treatment susceptible to the built-in
assumptions of a model that is fitted to the data. This is especially relevant
when analyzing solar-type pulsation in stars other than the Sun where the
observations are of lower quality and can be over-interpreted. As an example,
we apply our technique to CoRoT observations of the solar-type pulsator HD
49933.

making explicit use of the likelihood function, depending instead on simulation
of sample data sets from the model. In this paper we show that under the
assumption of the existence of a uniform additive model error term, ABC
algorithms give exact results when sufficient summaries are used. This
interpretation allows the approximation made in many previous application
papers to be understood, and should guide the choice of metric and tolerance in
future work. ABC algorithms can be generalized by replacing the 0-1 cut-off
with an acceptance probability that varies with the distance of the simulated
data from the observed data. The acceptance density gives the distribution of
the error term, enabling the uniform error usually used to be replaced by a
general distribution. This generalization can also be applied to approximate
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. In light of this work, ABC algorithms can
be seen as calibration techniques for implicit stochastic models, inferring
parameter values in light of the computer model, data, prior beliefs about the
parameter values, and any measurement or model errors.

  Transfer Equation","15 pages, 6 figures; submitted to Mathematical and Computer Modelling",,,,"physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In modern surgery, a multitude of minimally intrusive operational techniques
are used which are based on the punctual heating of target zones of human
tissue via laser or radio-frequency currents. Traditionally, these processes
are modeled by the bioheat equation introduced by Pennes, who considers
Fourier's theory of heat conduction. We present an alternative and more
realistic model established by the hyperbolic equation of heat transfer. To
demonstrate some features and advantages of our proposed method, we apply the
obtained results to different types of tissue heating with high energy fluxes,
in particular radiofrequency heating and pulsed laser treatment of the cornea
to correct refractive errors. Hopefully, the results of our approach help to
refine surgical interventions in this novel field of medical treatment.

$u_t^i-D_\alpha(a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}D_\beta u^j)=-div f^i$ in the generalized
Morrey Space $L_{\phi}^{2,\lambda}$ . We would like to understand the
regularity of the solutions of this system. It will be shown that 1: if
$a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}\in C(\bar{Q_{T}})$ then $Du\in L_\phi^{2,\lambda}$, and
2: if $a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}\in VMO(Q_{T})$ then $Du\in L_\phi^{2,\lambda}$.
Moreover we will be able to obtain estimates on the gradient of the solutions
to the system, which will tell us about the regularity of the solutions.

matter described by the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model subject to a strong
magnetic field. The Landau levels are filled in such a way that usual kinks
appear in the effective mass and other related quantities. $\beta$-equilibrium
is also considered and the macroscopic properties of a magnetar described by
this quark matter is obtained. Our study shows that the magnetar masses and
radii are larger if the magnetic field increases but only very large fields
($\ge 10^{18}$ G) affect the EoS in a non negligible way.

provided detailed femtoscopic information describing the space-time structure
of the emission of pions. This data had avoided description with
hydrodynamic-based approaches, in contrast to the success of hydrodynamics in
reproducing other classes of observables. This failure has inspired the term
``HBT puzzle'', where HBT refers to femtoscopic studies which were originally
based on Hanbury-Brown Twiss interferometry. Here, the puzzle is shown to
originate not from a single shortcoming of hydrodynamic models, but the
combination of several effects: mainly including pre-thermalized acceleration,
using a stiffer equation of state, and adding viscous corrections.

special experimental scheme called C-path gate with which the realization of
all possible bipartite POVMs of two-photon polarization states can be simpler
and nearly deterministic. Following the same technique, the schemes of the
realization of quantum control gates have been proposed, including the CNOT
gate (1/2), Fredkin gate (1/8), Toffoli gate (2/23), CU gate and even MCU gate.
All these gates are scalable with the certain probabilities which are larger
than those gates in linear optics. Less resource are required and the
structures of these gates are so simple that we think they are feasible with
current technology and may be useful for the realization of universal
computation in optics.
