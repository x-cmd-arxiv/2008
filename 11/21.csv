the S-matrix was made by Benincasa and Cachazo in 0705.4305, who noted that
mutual consistency of different BCFW constructions of four-particle amplitudes
generates non-trivial (but familiar) constraints on three-particle coupling
constants --- these include gauge invariance, the equivalence principle, and
the lack of non-trivial couplings for spins >2. These constraints can also be
derived with weaker assumptions, by demanding the existence of four-point
amplitudes that factorize properly in all unitarity limits with complex
momenta. From this starting point, we show that the BCFW prescription can be
interpreted as an algorithm for fully constructing a tree-level S-matrix, and
that complex factorization of general BCFW amplitudes follows from the
factorization of four-particle amplitudes. The allowed set of BCFW deformations
is identified, formulated entirely as a statement on the three-particle sector,
and using only complex factorization as a guide. Consequently, our analysis
based on the physical consistency of the S-matrix is entirely independent of
field theory. We analyze the case of pure Yang-Mills, and outline a proof for
gravity. For Yang-Mills, we also show that the well-known scaling behavior of
BCFW-deformed amplitudes at large z is a simple consequence of factorization.
For gravity, factorization in certain channels requires asymptotic behavior
~1/z^2.

in order to test the suggestion that radiation pressure force is affecting the

samples are drawn from the SDSS archive and are modified to represent the same
parent distribution at 0.1 < z < 0.2. BH masses in type-I sources are
calculated in two different ways, one using a simple virial mass assumption and
the other by taking into account the effect of radiation pressure force on the
gas. The simple virial mass estimate results in good agreement with the
sigma*-based BH mass and L/L(Edd) estimates in type-II sources. In contrast,
there is a clear disagreement in the L/L(Edd) distributions when radiation
pressure-based estimates are used. This indicates that radiation pressure force
is not important in 0.1 < z < 0.2 AGNs with L(5100)=10^{42.8-44.8} erg/s. This
has important implications to the physics of the gas producing the broad

experiencing direct collapses and/or tumbling cascades, but also other regions
of vacua whose stability is protected by ``great walls'' as well as regions of
vacua populating ``forbidden cities'' into which tunnelling cannot occur. We
also discuss possible applications of this setup for the cosmological-constant

for Z' phenomenology. Finally, we point out that a limiting case of our setup
yields theories with yet another new vacuum structure: infinite numbers of

Bloch waves, with energy eigenvalues approximating a continuum and giving rise

very broadband receiver. This instrument, which we call the Redshift Search
Receiver, has an instantaneous bandwidth of 36 GHz and operates from 74 to
110.5 GHz. The receiver has been built at UMass/FCRAO to be part of the initial
instrumentation for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) and is intended
primarily for determination of the redshift of distant, dust-obscured galaxies.
It is being tested on the FCRAO 14m by measuring the 3mm spectra of a number of
nearby galaxies. There are interesting differences in the chemistry of these
galaxies.

at 43 GHz which varies with the total intensity. The delay of approximately 10
minutes between the peaks of the flares at the two frequencies is seen to
decrease with time, and we find that synchrotron self-absorption and free-free
absorption by entrained thermal material play a larger role in determining the
opacity than absorption in the stellar wind of the companion. A shock-in-jet
model gives a good fit to the lightcurves at all frequencies, demonstrating
that this mechanism, which has previously been used to explain the brighter,
longer-lived giant outbursts in this source, is also applicable to these
low-level flaring events. Assembling the data from outbursts spanning over two
orders of magnitude in flux density shows evidence for a strong correlation
between the peak brightness of an event, and the timescale and frequency at
which this is attained. Brighter flares evolve on longer timescales and peak at
lower frequencies. Analysis of the fitted model parameters suggests that
brighter outbursts are due to shocks forming further downstream in the jet,
with an increased electron normalisation and magnetic field strength both
playing a role in setting the strength of the outburst.

by collecting the electrons on a segmented anode. Custom-made preamplifiers
have been especially developed for this purpose. Cosmic ray tracks have been
successfully observed in pure gas at room temperature and in double phase Ar

that cycles of latitudinal flows into and radial flows out of the polar regions
amplify the field parallel to the symmetry axis, typically increasing the total
magnetic energy by about two orders of magnitude. Nonaxisymmetric calculations
result in fundamentally different flows and a larger magnetic energy increase:
shearing associated with the SASI spiral mode contributes to a widespread and
turbulent field amplification mechanism, boosting the magnetic energy by almost
four orders of magnitude (a result which remains very sensitive to the spatial
resolution of the numerical simulations). While the SASI may contribute to
neutron star magnetization, these simulations do not show qualitatively new
features in the global evolution of the shock as a result of SASI-induced

renormalization. Based on the proposal that functional integrals for
interacting nonrenormalizable models do not reduce to the expression for the
free field functional integral as the coupling constant vanishes -- a proposal
supported by the fact that even the set of classical solutions for such models

interaction term acts partially as a hard core eliminating certain fields
otherwise allowed by the free theory. As a consequence, interacting models are
continuously connected to a pseudofree theory that takes into account the hard
core as the coupling constant vanishes, and this general view is supported not
only by simple quantum mechanical examples as well as soluble but
nonrelativistic nonrenormalizable models. The present article proposes a
pseudofree model for relativistic nonrenormalizable models about which it is
argued that a perturbation expansion of the interaction is term-by-term

useful testing ground for this problem, because its duplicated genes with
different evolutionary birth and destiny are well distinguishable. In
particular, there is a clear detection for the occurrence of a Whole Genome
Duplication (WGD) event in S. cerevisiae, and the genes derived from this event
(WGD paralogs) are known. We studied WGD and non-WGD duplicates by two parallel
analysis based on structural protein domains and on Gene Ontology annotation
scheme respectively. The results show that while a large number of
``duplicable'' structural domains is shared in local and global duplications,
WGD and non-WGD paralogs tend to have different functions. The reason for this
is the existence of WGD and non-WGD specific domains with largely different
functions. In agreement with the recent findings of Wapinski and collaborators
(Nature 449, 2007), WGD paralogs often perform ``core'' cell functions, such as
translation and DNA replication, while local duplications associate with
``peripheral'' functions such as response to stress. Our results also support
the fact that domain architectures are a reliable tool to detect homology, as
the domains of duplicates are largely invariant with date and nature of the
duplication, while their sequences and also their functions might migrate.

First, we find an additional power-law dependence of the tunneling probability
on the semiclassical parameter as compared to the standard case of potential
tunneling. The second signature is substantial widening of the probability
distribution over final-state quantum numbers. These effects are studied using
modified semiclassical technique which incorporates stabilization of the
tunneling trajectories. The technique is derived from first principles. We
obtain expressions for the inclusive and exclusive tunneling probabilities in
the case of unstable semiclassical trajectories. We also investigate the ""phase
transition"" between the cases of stable and unstable trajectories across

to probe the very local structure of materials, especially for disordered and
heterogeneous systems. This is technologically important; for example, the
nanoscale structure of glassy polymers has a direct correlation with their
macroscopic physical properties. We have discovered how a local, high frequency
dynamic process can be used to monitor and even predict macroscopic behavior in
glassy polymers. Polyvinylethylenes vitrified by different chemical and
thermodynamic pathways exhibit different densities in the glassy state. We find
that the rate and amplitude of a high frequency relaxation mode (the
Johari-Goldstein process involving local motion of segments of the chain
backbone) can either correlate or anti-correlate with the density. This implies
that neither the unoccupied (free) volume nor the configurational entropy
governs the local dynamics in any general sense. Rather it is the magnitude of
the fluctuations in local density that underlie these nm-scale motions. We show
how properties of the dynamics and the density fluctuations can both be
interpreted in terms of an asymmetric double well potential. Finally, since
fluctuations underlie the macroscopic properties, we argue that information
about the latter should be obtainable from characterization of the local
dynamics.

energy in the \nu F_\nu spectrum, and the photon index (\Gamma) derived from a
simple power-law model. The Epeak - \Gamma relation, assuming the typical
smoothly broken power-law spectrum of GRBs, is \log Epeak = 3.258 - 0.829\Gamma

and fluences, but also distributions for both the low-energy photon index and
the high-energy photon index in the smoothly broken power-law model. The
distribution of burst durations in the BAT GRB sample is also included in the
simulation. Our correlation is consistent with the index observed by BAT and
Epeak measured by the BAT, and by other GRB instruments. Since about 85% of
GRBs observed by the BAT are acceptably fit with the simple power-law model
because of the relatively narrow energy range of the BAT, this relationship can
be used to estimate Epeak when it is located within the BAT energy range.

variance achieved by three important single-shot measurement strategies. We
show that the single-copy canonical phase measurement does not always attain
the optimal bounds in the many-copy scenario. Adaptive homodyning schemes do
attain the bounds for displaced thermal states, but for squeezed states they
yield fidelities that are insensitive to temperature variations and are,
therefore, sub-optimal. Finally, we find that heterodyne measurements perform
very poorly for pure states but can attain the optimal bounds for sufficiently
mixed states. We apply our results to investigate the influence of losses in an

Hamiltonians - each local Hamiltonian specifies a local constraint whose
violation contributes to the energy of the given quantum state. Formalizing the
intuitive connection between the ground (minimal) energy of the Hamiltonian and
the minimum number of violated constraints is problematic, since the number of
constraints being violated is not well defined when the terms in the
Hamiltonian do not commute. The detectability lemma proved in this paper
provides precisely such a quantitative connection. We apply the lemma to derive
a quantum analogue of a basic primitive in classical complexity: amplification
of probabilities by random walks on expander graphs. It holds under the
restriction that the interaction graph of the local Hamiltonian is an expander.
Our proofs are based on a novel structure imposed on the Hilbert space that we
call the $XY$ decomposition, which enables a reduction from the quantum
non-commuting case to the commuting case (where many classical arguments go
through).
  The results may have several interesting implications. First, proving a
quantum analogue to the PCP theorem is one of the most important challenges in
quantum complexity theory. Our quantum gap amplification lemma may be viewed as
the quantum analogue of the first of the three main steps in Dinur's PCP proof.
Quantum gap amplification may also be related to spectral gap amplification,
and in particular, to fault tolerance of adiabatic computation. Finally, the
detectability lemma, and the $XY$ decomposition provide a handle on the
structure of local Hamiltonians and their ground states.

formation is affected by a variation in the disk magnetic flux profile and/or
the existence of a central stellar magnetosphere. Our simulations evolve from
an initial, hydrostatic equilibrium state in a force-free magnetic field
configuration. We find a unique relation between the collimation degree and the
disk wind magnetization power law exponent. The collimation degree decreases
for steeper disk magnetic field profiles. Highly collimated outflows resulting
from a flat profile tend to be unsteady. We further consider a magnetic field
superposed of a stellar dipole and a disk field in parallel or anti-parallel
alignment. Both stellar and disk wind may evolve in a pair of outflows,
however, a reasonably strong disk wind component is essential for jet
collimation. Strong flares may lead to a sudden change in mass flux by a factor
two. We hypothesize that such flares may eventually trigger jet knots.

differential equation that plays an important role in financial option pricing,
Heston (1993, Rev. Finan. Stud. 6). A feature of this time-dependent,
two-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equation is the presence of a
mixed spatial-derivative term, which stems from the correlation between the two
underlying stochastic processes for the asset price and its variance.
  Semi-discretization of the Heston PDE, using finite difference schemes on a
non-uniform grid, gives rise to large systems of stiff ordinary differential
equations. For the effective numerical solution of these systems, standard
implicit time-stepping methods are often not suitable anymore, and tailored
time-discretization methods are required. In the present paper, we investigate
four splitting schemes of the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) type: the
Douglas scheme, the Craig & Sneyd scheme, the Modified Craig & Sneyd scheme,
and the Hundsdorfer & Verwer scheme - each of which contains a free parameter.
  ADI schemes were not originally developed to deal with mixed
spatial-derivative terms. Accordingly, we first discuss the adaptation of the
above four ADI schemes to the Heston equation. Subsequently, we present various
numerical examples with realistic data sets from the literature, where we
consider European call options as well as down-and-out barrier options.
Combined with ample theoretical stability results for ADI schemes that have
recently been obtained in In 't Hout & Welfert (2007, Appl. Numer. Math.), we
arrive at three ADI schemes that all prove to be very effective in the
numerical solution of the Heston PDE with a mixed derivative term.

been discovered in the solar neighbourhood (closer than ~100 pc), thanks to
cross-correlation between X-ray, optical spectroscopy and kinematic data. These
young local associations offer insights into the star formation process in
low-density environments, shed light on the substellar domain, and could have
played an important role in the recent history of the local interstellar
medium. Ages estimates for these associations have been derived in the
literature by several ways. In this work we have studied the kinematic
evolution of young local associations and their relation to other young stellar
groups and structures in the local interstellar medium, thus casting new light
on recent star formation processes in the solar neighbourhood. We compiled the
data published in the literature for young local associations, including the
astrometric data from the new Hipparcos reduction. Using a realistic Galactic
potential we integrated the orbits for these associations and the Sco-Cen
complex back in time. Combining these data with the spatial structure of the
Local Bubble and the spiral structure of the Galaxy, we propose a recent
history of star formation in the solar neighbourhood. We suggest that both the
Sco-Cen complex and young local associations originated as a result of the
impact of the inner spiral arm shock wave against a giant molecular cloud. The
core of the giant molecular cloud formed the Sco-Cen complex, and some small
cloudlets in a halo around the giant molecular cloud formed young local
associations several million years later. We also propose a supernova in young
local associations a few million years ago as the most likely candidate to have
reheated the Local Bubble to its present temperature.

derived using point-like source aperture polarimetry, and the magnetic field
structure position angle around the cluster region in S106 was found to be ~
120$\arcdeg$. The magnetic fields in the cluster region, however, have three
type position angles: ~ 20$\arcdeg$, ~ 80$\arcdeg$, and ~ 120$\arcdeg$. The
present magnetic field structures are consistent with results obtained by
submillimeter continuum observations. We found that the magnetic field
direction in the dense gas region is not consistent with that of the low
density gas region.

within the solar convection zone. In particular, the differential rotation is
now well constrained by helioseismic observations. Helioseismology also gives
us information about the depth-dependence of the meridional circulation in the
near-surface layers. The typical velocity inputs used in solar dynamo models,
however, continue to be an analytic fit to the observed differential rotation
and a theoretically constructed meridional flow profile that matches only the
peak flow speed at the surface. Here we take the first steps towards realistic
helioseismic data assimilation, by presenting methodologies for constructing
differential rotation and meridional circulation profiles that more closely
conform to the observational constraints currently available. We also present
simulations driven by the assimilated rotation and four plausible profiles for
the internal meridional circulation -- all of which match the helioseismically
inferred near-surface depth-dependence, but whose magnitudes are made to vary.
We discuss how the results compare with those that are driven by purely
analytic fits. Our results indicate that the latitudinal shear of the rotation
in the bulk of the solar convection zone plays a more important role, than
either the tachocline or surface radial shear, in the induction of toroidal
field. We also find that it is the speed of the equatorward counter-flow in the
meridional flow at the base of the convection zone, and not how far into the
radiative interior it penetrates, that primarily determines the dynamo cycle
period. Given that improved helioseismic constraints are expected to be
available in the future, our analysis lays the basis for assimilating these
data within dynamo models.

subset of {\it Swift} triggered long duration bursts, we show that the mean
time taken to acquire spectroscopic redshifts for a GRB OA has evolved to
shorter times. We identify a strong correlation between the mean time taken to
acquire a spectroscopic redshift and the measured redshift. This correlation
reveals that shorter response times favour smaller redshift bursts. This is
compelling evidence for a selection effect that biases longer response times
with relatively brighter high redshift bursts. Conversely, for shorter response
times, optically fainter bursts that are relatively closer are bright enough
for spectroscopic redshifts to be acquired. This selection effect could explain
why the average redshift, $<z>\approx2.8$ measured in 2005, has evolved to
$<z>\approx2$, by mid 2008. Understanding these selection effects provides an
important tool for separating the contributions of intrinsically faint bursts,
those obscured by host galaxy dust and bursts not seen in the optical because
their OAs are observed at late times. The study highlights the importance of
rapid response telescopes capable of spectroscopy, and identifies a new
redshift selection effect that has not been considered previously, namely the
response time to measure the redshift.

It is not
surprising that there exist a plethora of sorting algorithms. For all the
sorting algorithms, it is an accepted performance limit that sorting algorithms
are linearithmic or O(N lg N). The linearithmic lower bound in performance
stems from the fact that the sorting algorithms use the ordering property of
the data. The sorting algorithm uses comparison by the ordering property to
arrange the data elements from an initial permutation into a sorted
permutation.
  Linear O(N) sorting algorithms exist, but use a priori knowledge of the data
to use a specific property of the data and thus have greater performance. In
contrast, the linearithmic sorting algorithms are generalized by using a
universal property of data-comparison, but have a linearithmic performance
lower bound. The trade-off in sorting algorithms is generality for performance
by the chosen property used to sort the data elements.
  A general-purpose, linear sorting algorithm in the context of the trade-off
of performance for generality at first consideration seems implausible. But,
there is an implicit assumption that only the ordering property is universal.
But, as will be discussed and examined, it is not the only universal property
for data elements. The binar sort is a general-purpose sorting algorithm that
uses this other universal property to sort linearly.

of other algorithms and computational processes. An analogy is that a deck of
cards is ordered within the pack, but before a game of poker or solitaire the
deck is shuffled to create a random permutation. Shuffling is used to assure
that an aggregate of data elements for a sequence S is randomly arranged, but
avoids an ordered or partially ordered permutation.
  Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random
permutation. The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements, there are N!
possible permutations. For the large number of possible permutations, two of
the possible permutations are for a sorted or ordered placement of data
elements--both an ascending and descending sorted permutation. Shuffling must
avoid inadvertently creating either an ascending or descending permutation.
  Shuffling is frequently coupled to another algorithmic function --
pseudo-random number generation. The efficiency and quality of the shuffle is
directly dependent upon the random number generation algorithm utilized. A more
effective and efficient method of shuffling is to use parameterization to
configure the shuffle, and to shuffle into sub-arrays by utilizing the encoding
of the data elements. The binar shuffle algorithm uses the encoding of the data
elements and parameterization to avoid any direct coupling to a random number

post-Newtonian order, the Christodoulou memory affects the gravitational-wave
amplitude at leading (Newtonian) order. Previous calculations have computed
this non-oscillatory amplitude correction during the inspiral phase of binary

powerfully the existence of certain dark sectors of fundamental physics, i.e.,
existence of particles and fields outside the standard models and inaccessible
by current experiments. Various approaches are taken to modify/extend the
standard models. Generic theories introduce multiple de-coupled fields A, B, C,
each responsible for the effects of DM (cold supersymmetric particles), DE
(Dark Energy) effect, and MG (Modified Gravity) effect respectively. Some
theories use adopt vanilla combinations like AB, BC, or CA, and assume A, B, C
belong to decoupled sectors of physics. MOND-like MG and Cold DM are often
taken as opposite frameworks, e.g. in the debate around the Bullet Cluster.
Here we argue that these ad hoc divisions of sectors miss important clues from
the data. The data actually suggest that the physics of all dark sectors is
likely linked together by a self-interacting oscillating field, which governs a
chameleon-like dark fluid, appearing as DM, DE and MG in different settings. It
is timely to consider an interdisciplinary approach across all semantic
boundaries of dark sectors, treating the dark stress as one identity, hence
accounts for several ""coincidences"" naturally.

magnetic field, which is always conservative in nature, the spin torque induced

further show that the magnetic moment of itinerant electrons develops an

supersymmetries is pointed out. In the Dirac theory on curved spaces,
Killing-Yano tensors generate Dirac type operators involved in interesting
algebraic structures as dynamical algebras or even infinite dimensional
algebras or superalgebras. The general results are applied to space-times which
appear in modern studies. One presents the infinite dimensional superalgebra of
Dirac type operators on the 4-dimensional Euclidean Taub-NUT space that can be
seen as a twisted loop algebra. The existence of the conformal Killing-Yano

phase space of classical and quantum de Sitter (dS) and Anti de Sitter (AdS)
cosmology. Since this length has been suggested in quantum gravity and string
theory, its effects in the early universe might be expected. Adopting the
existence of such a minimum length results in the Generalized Uncertainty
Principle (GUP), which is a deformed Heisenberg algebra between minisuperspace
variables and their momenta operators. We extend these deformed commutating
relations to the corresponding deformed Poisson algebra in the classical limit.
Using the resulting Poisson and Heisenberg relations, we then construct the
classical and quantum cosmology of dS and Ads models in a canonical framework.
We show that in classical dS cosmology this effect yields an inflationary
universe in which the rate of expansion is larger than the usual dS universe.
Also, for the AdS model it is shown that GUP might change the oscillatory
nature of the corresponding cosmology. We also study the effects of GUP in
quantized models through approximate analytical solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt
(WD) equation, in the limit of small scale factor for the universe, and compare
the results with the ordinary quantum cosmology in each case.

clearance $c$ between the bubble interface and the wall. Motivated by the fact
that experimentally measured migration velocity (Takemura et al. (2002, J.
Fluid Mech. {\bf 461}, 277)) is higher than the velocity estimated by the
available analytical solution (Magnaudet et al. (2003, J. Fluid Mech. {\bf

1$ (here $a$ is the bubble radius), when the clearance parameter
$\epsilon(=c/a)$ is comparable to or smaller than unit, the numerical analysis
based on the boundary-fitted finite-difference approach by solving the Stokes

black holes starting at separations of 100 pc can evolve down to
gravitational-wave-induced coalescence in less than a Hubble time. The
binaries, in our models, often form with very high eccentricity and, as a
result, reach separations of 50 Schwarzschild radius with eccentricities which
are clearly distinct from zero -- even though gravitational wave emission damps
the eccentricity during the inspiral. These deviations from exact circular
orbits, at such small separations, may have important consequences for LISA
data analysis.

because either new exons are generated from intronic transposed elements (this
is called exonization), or the element inserts into the exon, leading to a new
transcript. Several examples in the literature show that isoforms generated by
an exonization are specific to a certain tissue (for example the heart muscle)
or inflict a disease. Thus, exonizations can have negative effects for the
transcriptome of an organism. Results: As we aimed at detecting other tissue-
or tumor-specific isoforms in human and mouse genomes which were generated
through exonization of a transposed element, we designed the automated analysis
pipeline SERpredict (SER = Specific Exonized Retroelement) making use of
Bayesian Statistics. With this pipeline, we found several genes in which a
transposed element formed a tissue- or tumor-specific isoform. Conclusion: Our
results show that SERpredict produces relevant results, demonstrating the
importance of transposed elements in shaping both the human and the mouse

are two mechanisms that enhance genomic diversity. We examined whether there is
less selection against exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes
than in single-copy genes. Results: Genome-wide analysis of exonization of
transposed elements revealed a higher rate of exonization within duplicated
genes relative to single-copy genes. The gene for TIF-IA, an RNA polymerase I
transcription initiation factor, underwent a humanoid-specific triplication,
all three copies of the gene are active transcriptionally, although only one
copy retains the ability to generate the TIF-IA protein. Prior to TIF-IA
triplication, an Alu element was inserted into the first intron. In one of the
non-protein coding copies, this Alu is exonized. We identified a single point
mutation leading to exonization in one of the gene duplicates. When this
mutation was introduced into the TIF-IA coding copy, exonization was activated
and the level of the protein-coding mRNA was reduced substantially. A very low
level of exonization was detected in normal human cells. However, this
exonization was abundant in most leukemia cell lines evaluated, although the
genomic sequence is unchanged in these cancerous cells compared to normal
cells. Conclusion: The definition of the Alu element within the TIF-IA gene as
an exon is restricted to certain types of cancers; the element is not exonized
in normal human cells. These results further our understanding of the delicate
interplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing and of the

the editing sites are located in the primate-specific retrotransposed element

extensive Alu-Alu dsRNA formation in mRNA precursors. Yet, the effect of these

show that more Alus flank alternatively spliced exons than constitutively
spliced ones; this is especially notable for those exons that have changed
their mode of splicing from constitutive to alternative during human evolution.
This implies that Alu insertions may change the mode of splicing of the

canonical divisors. When $X$ is minimal and its Kodaira dimension is positive,
this sequence of flips terminates in $M(H_X)$; $H_X$ is an ample line bundle
lying so closely to $K_X$ that the canonical divisor of $M(H_X)$ is nef. Remark
that so-called Thaddeus-type flips somewhat differ from flips with respect to

abundances for a sample of 35 early-type galaxies spanning a range of masses
and local environment. The nitrogen-sensitive molecular feature at 3360\AA has
been employed in conjunction with a suite of atomic- and molecular-sensitive
indices to provide unique and definitive constraints on the chemical content of
these systems. By employing NH3360, we are now able to break the carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen degeneracies inherent to the use of the CN-index. We
demonstrate that the NH3360 feature shows little dependency upon the velocity
dispersion (our proxy for mass) of the galaxies, contrary to what is seen for
carbon- and magnesium-sensitive indices. At face value, these results are at
odds with conclusions drawn previously using indices sensitive to both carbon
and nitrogen, such as cyanogen (CN). With the aid of stellar population models,
we find that the N/Fe ratios in these galaxies are consistent with being
mildly-enhanced with respect to the solar ratio. We also explore the dependence
of these findings upon environment, by analyzing the co-added spectra of
galaxies in the field and the Coma cluster. We confirm the previously found
differences in carbon abundances between galaxies in low- and high-density
environments, while showing that these differences do not seem to exist for
nitrogen. We discuss the implications of these findings for the derivation of
the star formation histories in early-type galaxies, and for the origin of
carbon and nitrogen, themselves.

the amount of silicon particles used in the experiments and that, in general,
the reaction slows down for greater amounts. This trend is explained by
particle stacking, which restricts the exchange of gases between the furnace
atmosphere and the atmosphere around the inner particles. In a first stage,
local oxygen partial pressure increases around the inner particles and inhibits
nitridation locally. If the amount of reactant Si nanoparticles is small
enough, this extrinsic effect is avoided and the intrinsic nitridation kinetics
can be measured. Experiments show that intrinsic kinetics does not depend on

5394.7 A line in the solar irradiance spectrum brightens more at larger

sensitivity is caused by spectral interlocking to chromospheric emission in Mg
II h & k is disputed.
  Classical one-dimensional modeling is used for demonstration; modern
three-dimensional MHD simulation for verification and analysis.
  The Mn I 5394.7 A line thanks its unusual sensitivity to solar activity to
its hyperfine structure. This overrides the thermal and granular Doppler
smearing through which the other, narrower, photospheric lines lose such
sensitivity. We take the nearby Fe I 5395.2 A line as example of the latter and
analyze the formation of both lines in detail to demonstrate and explain
granular Doppler brightening. We show that this affects all narrow lines.
Neither the chromosphere nor Mg II h & k play a role, nor is it correct to
describe the activity sensitivity of Mn I 5394.7 A through plage models with
outward increasing temperature contrast.
  The Mn I 5394.7 A line represents a proxy diagnostic of strong-field magnetic
concentrations in the deep solar photosphere comparable to the G band and the
blue wing of H-alpha, but not a better one than these. The Mn I lines are more
promising as diagnostic of weak fields in high-resolution Stokes polarimetry.

beyond R500 ~ 0.7 R200. Our study aims to measure the slopes of the X-ray
surface brightness and of the gas density profiles in the outskirts of massive
clusters. These constraints are compared to similar results obtained from
observations and numerical simulations of the temperature and dark matter
density profiles with the intention of presenting a consistent picture of the
outer regions of galaxy clusters. We extract the surface brightness profiles
Sb(r) of 52 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z>0.3 from X-ray exposures
obtained with Chandra. We estimate R200 using both a beta-model that reproduces
Sb(r) and scaling relations from the literature. The two methods converge to
comparable values. We determine the radius, R_S2N, at which the signal-to-noise
ratio is larger than 2 and select the objects in the sample that satisfy the
criterion R_S2N/R200 > 0.7. For the eleven selected objects, we model with a
power-law the behaviour of Sb(r). We measure a consistent steepening of the
Sb(r) profile moving outward from 0.4 R200, where an average slope of -3.6
(sigma=0.8) is estimated. At R200, we evaluate a slope of -4.3 (sigma=0.9) that
implies a slope in the gas density profile of -2.6 and a predicted mean value
of the surface brightness in the 0.5-2 band of 2e-12 erg/s/cm2/deg2. Combined
with estimates of the outer slope of the gas temperature profile and
expectations about the dark matter distribution, these measurements allow us to
describe properly how X-ray luminous clusters behave out to the virial radius.

Tauri stars belonging to the Lindroos binary sample. Most of these objects show
IR excesses in their spectral energy distributions, which are indicative of the
presence of disks. The work is relevant in the fields of stellar physics,
physics of disks and formation of planetary systems.
  Spectral energy distributions and mid-resolution spectra were used to
estimate the effective temperature. The comparison of the profiles of the
Balmer lines with synthetic profiles provides the value of the stellar gravity.
High-resolution optical observations and synthetic spectra are used to estimate
the metallicity, [M/H]. Once these three parameters are known for each star,
evolutionary tracks and isochrones provide estimations of the mass, luminosity,
age and distance (or upper limits in some cases). The method is original in the
sense that it is distance-independent, i.e. the estimation of the stellar
parameters does not require, as it happens in other works, the knowledge of the
distance to the object. A detailed discussion on some individual objects, in
particular VV Ser, RR Tau, 49 Cet and the three suspected hot companions of
post-T Tauris, is presented. The paper also shows the difficulty posed by the
morphology and behaviour of the system star+disk in the computation of the
stellar parameters.

ejected subhalos in the total halo population of the same mass ranges from 9%

hosts in comparison to normal halos. The number of subhalos ejected from a host
of given mass increases with the assembly redshift of the host. Ejected
subhalos in general reside in high-density regions, and have a much higher bias
parameter than normal halos of the same mass. They also have earlier assembly
times, so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter halos seen
in cosmological simulations. However, the assembly bias is {\it not} dominated
by the ejected population, indicating that large-scale environmental effects on
normal halos are the main source for the assembly bias.
