spontaneously broken and neutrino masses are generated through the Type I
seesaw mechanism and R-parity violation. In this theory R-parity and the gauge
symmetry are broken by the sneutrino vacuum expectation values and there is no
Majoron problem. The SU(2)_R and R-parity violation scales are determined by
the SUSY breaking scale making the model very predictive. We discuss the
spectrum and possible tests of the theory through the neutralinos, charginos,
Z^' and W_R decays at the Large Hadron Collider.

recovered when both photometric and two-dimensional stellar kinematic
observations are available. We simulate these observations with galaxy models
that are representative of observed oblate fast-rotator to triaxial
slow-rotator early-type galaxies. By fitting realistic triaxial dynamical
models to these simulated observations, we recover the intrinsic shape (and
mass-to-light ratio), without making additional (ad-hoc) assumptions on the
orientation.
  For (near) axisymmetric galaxies the dynamical modelling can strongly exclude
triaxiality, but the regular kinematics do not further tighten the constraint
on the intrinsic flattening significantly, so that the inclination is nearly
unconstrained above the photometric lower limit even with two-dimensional
stellar kinematics. Triaxial galaxies can have additional complexity in both
the observed photometry and kinematics, such as twists and (central)
kinematically decoupled components, which allows the intrinsic shape to be
accurately recovered. For galaxies that are very round or show no significant
rotation, recovery of the shape is degenerate, unless additional constraints
such as from a thin disk are available.

One of the targets can be accounted for by normal stellar evolution. It is a
star with initial mass around 40-50 Msun in, or close to, the core He burning
phase. The other two objects must follow a peculiar evolution, governed by fast
rotation. In particular, one object is likely evolving homogeneously due to its
position blue-ward of the main sequence and its high H mass fraction. The
clumping factor of one star is found to be 0.15+/-0.05. This is comparable to
values found for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, indicating that within the

in disordered materials for a wide range of $\alpha$ values ($0< \alpha < 2$).
More precisely, we have considered the resistance fluctuations of a thin
resistor with granular structure in different stationary states: from nearly
equilibrium up to far from equilibrium conditions. This system has been
modelled as a network made by different species of resistors, distinguished by
their resistances, temperature coefficients and by the energies associated with
thermally activated processes of breaking and recovery. The correlation
behavior of the resistance fluctuations is analyzed as a function of the
temperature and applied current, in both the frequency and time domains. For
the noise frequency exponent, the model provides $0< \alpha < 1$ at low
currents, in the Ohmic regime, with $\alpha$ decreasing inversely with the
temperature, and $1< \alpha <2$ at high currents, in the non-Ohmic regime.
Since the threshold current associated with the onset of nonlinearity also
depends on the temperature, the proposed model qualitatively accounts for the
complicate behavior of $\alpha$ versus temperature and current observed in many
experiments. Correspondingly, in the time domain, the auto-correlation function
of the resistance fluctuations displays a variety of behaviors which are tuned
by the external conditions.

within the framework of the diffusive shock acceleration theory, which allows
effective conversion of the explosion energy into cosmic rays. Although the
models of nonlinear shocks describe reasonably well the nonthermal component of
emission, certain issues, including the heating of the thermal plasma and the
related X-ray emission, remain still open.
  Aims: To discuss how the evolution and structure of supernova remnants is
affected by strong particle acceleration at the forward shock.
  Methods: Analytical estimates combined with detailed discussion of the
physical processes.
  Results: The overall dynamics is shown to be relatively insensitive to the
amount of particle acceleration, but the post-shock gas temperature can be
reduced to a relatively small multiple, even as small as six times, the ambient
temperature with a very weak dependence on the shock speed. This is in marked
contrast to pure gas models where the temperature is insensitive to the ambient
temperature and is determined by the square of the shock speed. It thus appears
to be possible to suppress effectively thermal X-ray emission from remnants by
strong particle acceleration. This might provide a clue for understanding the
lack of thermal X-rays from the TeV bright supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946.

The thermodynamic potential has a structure which depends only on the spectrum
of quasiparticles propagating in fixed condensation fields, with coupling
constants that can be related directly to the variances of the microscopic
processes. The resulting phase diagram reveals a fixed number of phase
topologies whose realizations depend on a single coupling-parameter ratio,
alpha. Most phase topologies are realized for a broad range of values of alpha

condensed matter physics of the 20th century. The standard explanations of the
famous integer quantized Hall plateaus in the transverse resistivity are
qualitative, and involve assumptions about disorder, localized states, extended
states, edge states, Fermi levels pinned by Landau levels, etc. These standard
narratives give plausible reasons for the existence of the plateaus, but
provide little in the way of even a qualitative understanding of the shape and
width of the Hall plateaus, much less a first principles calculation. The
injection model presented in this paper changes that situation. Rather than
focusing on the middle of the Hall device, we follow the electrons to their
source: one corner of the Hall bar and its steep electric field gradients. We
find the entire resistivity curve including the Hall plateaus is calculable as
a function of magnetic field, temperature, and current. The new higher current
experiments reported here show remarkable half integer features for the first
time; these are faithfully reproduced by the injection theory. The Hall
plateaus and half integer inflections are shown to result from the local
density of states appropriate to the magnetic field and the strong electric
field gradient at the injection corner.

space-based gravitational-wave detectors requires the cross-correlation of the
response of two or more independent detectors. The cross-correlation involves a
frequency-dependent factor -- the so-called overlap reduction function or
Hellings-Downs curve -- that depends on the relative geometry of each detector
pair: i.e., the detector separations and the relative orientation of their
antenna patterns (beams). An incorrect formulation of this geometrical factor
has appeared in the literature, leading to incorrect conclusions regarding the
sensitivity of proposed detectors to a stochastic gravitational-wave
background. To rectify these errors and as a reference for future work we
provide here a complete, first-principles derivation of the overlap reduction
function and assess the nature of the errors associated with the use of the
incorrect expression that has appeared in the literature. We describe the
behavior of the overlap reduction function in different limiting regimes, and
show how the difference between the correct and incorrect expressions can be
understood physically.

prototype of young early-type planetary systems, and there are now various
indications that a massive Jovian planet is orbiting the star at ~ 10 AU.
However, no planets have been detected around this star so far. Our goal was to
investigate the close environment of Beta Pic, searching for planetary
companion(s). Deep adaptive-optics L'-band images of Beta Pic were recorded
using the NaCo instrument at the Very Large Telescope. A faint point-like
signal is detected at a projected distance of ~ 8 AU from the star, within the
North-East side of the dust disk. Various tests were made to rule out with a
good confidence level possible instrumental or atmospheric artifacts. The
probability of a foreground or background contaminant is extremely low, based
in addition on the analysis of previous deep Hubble Space Telescope images. The
object L'=11.2 apparent magnitude would indicate a typical temperature of ~1500
K and a mass of ~ 8 Jovian masses. If confirmed, it could explain the main
morphological and dynamical peculiarities of the Beta Pic system. The present
detection is unique among A-stars by the proximity of the resolved planet to
its parent star. Its closeness and location inside the Beta Pic disk suggest a
formation process by core accretion or disk instabilities rather than a
binary-like formation process.

functional specialization, we explore the effect of neuronal density on the
development of neuronal interactions in vitro. Two types of cortical networks,
dense and sparse, with 50,000 and 12,000 total cells respectively, are studied.
Activation graphs that represent pairwise neuronal interactions are constructed
using a competitive first response model. These graphs reveal that, during
development in vitro, dense networks form activation connections earlier than
sparse networks. Link entropy analysis of dense net- work activation graphs
suggests that the majority of connections between electrodes are reciprocal in
nature. Information theoretic measures reveal that early functional information
interactions (among 3 cells) are synergetic in both dense and sparse networks.
However, during later stages of development, previously synergetic
relationships become primarily redundant in dense, but not in sparse networks.
Large link entropy values in the activation graph are related to the domination
of redundant ensembles in late stages of development in dense networks. Results
demonstrate differences between dense and sparse networks in terms of
informational groups, pairwise relationships, and activation graphs. These
differences suggest that variations in cell density may result in different
functional specialization of nervous system tissue in vivo.

if a transmitter-receiver pair can communicate with each other, i.e., the
Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) is above a certain threshold,
then every transmitted packet is received error-free by the receiver thereby.
Using this model, the per node capacity of the network was shown to be
$\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log{n}}})$. In reality, for any finite link SINR,
there is a non-zero probability of erroneous reception of the packet. We show
that in a large network, as the packet travels an asymptotically large number
of hops from source to destination, the cumulative impact of packet losses over
intermediate links results in a per-node throughput of only $O(\frac{1}{n})$.
We then propose a new scheduling scheme to counter this effect. The proposed
scheme provides tight guarantees on end-to-end packet loss probability, and
improves the per-node throughput to $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}

which makes the DIS in N=4 SYM almost identical to the one expected in high

divided into three regions which are discussed in the paper. We revisited the

For the purpose of obtaining this smooth line each amino acid is represented by

$\kappa(s)$, and torsion $\tau(s)$. The $\kappa(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ diagrams of

result of processing of primitive dust material in the disks surrouding these

of various polymorphs of silica and their amorphous versions computed from
earth-based laboratory measurements. This modeling indicates that the two
polymorphs of silica, tridymite and cristobalite, which form at successively
higher temperatures and low pressures, are the dominant forms of silica in the
TTS of our sample. These high temperature, low pressure polymorphs of silica
present in protoplanetary disks are consistent with a grain composed mostly of
tridymite named Ada found in the cometary dust samples collected from the
STARDUST mission to Comet 81P/Wild 2. The silica in these protoplanetary disks
may arise from incongruent melting of enstatite or from incongruent melting of
amorphous pyroxene, the latter being analogous to the former. The high
temperatures of 1200K-1300K and rapid cooling required to crystallize tridymite
or cristobalite set constraints on the mechanisms that could have formed the
silica in these protoplanetary disks, suggestive of processing of these grains

paper, we assume that spacetime may be linearized about Minkowski space close
to the outer boundary, which is taken to be a coordinate sphere. We reformulate
the boundary conditions as conditions on the gauge-invariant
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli scalars. Higher-order radial derivatives are eliminated
by rewriting the boundary conditions as a system of ODEs for a set of auxiliary
variables intrinsic to the boundary. From these we construct boundary data for
a set of well-posed constraint-preserving boundary conditions for the Einstein
equations in a first-order generalized harmonic formulation. This construction
has direct applications to outer boundary conditions in simulations of isolated
systems (e.g., binary black holes) as well as to the problem of
Cauchy-perturbative matching. As a test problem for our numerical
implementation, we consider linearized multipolar gravitational waves in TT
gauge, with angular momentum numbers l=2 (Teukolsky waves), 3 and 4. We
demonstrate that the perfectly absorbing boundary condition B_L of order L=l
yields no spurious reflections to linear order in perturbation theory. This is
in contrast to the lower-order absorbing boundary conditions B_L with L<l,
which include the widely used freezing-Psi_0 boundary condition that imposes
the vanishing of the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0.

experimental evidence, it has attracted strong experimental and theoretical
attention in the last few years since Kim and Chan (Penn State, USA) reported
evidence for nonclassical rotational inertia effects, a typical signature of
superfluidity, in samples of solid 4He. Since this ""first observation"", other
experimental groups have observed such effects in the response to the rotation
of samples of crystalline helium, and it has become clear that the response of
the solid is extremely sensitive to growth conditions, annealing processes, and
3He impurities. A peak in the specific heat in the same range of temperatures
has been reported as well as anomalies in the elastic behaviour of solid 4He
with a strong resemblance to the phenomena revealed by torsional oscillator
experiments. Very recently, the observation of unusual mass transport in hcp
solid 4He has also been reported, suggesting superflow. From the theoretical
point of view, powerful simulation methods have been used to study solid 4He,
but the interpretation of the data is still rather difficult; dealing with the
question of supersolidity means that one has to face not only the problem of
the coexistence of quantum coherence phenomena and crystalline order, exploring
the realm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum field theory, but also
the problem of the role of disorder, i.e., how defects, such as vacancies,
impurities, dislocations, and grain boundaries, participate in the phase

instrumentation soon achieving milliarcsecond spatial resolutions for faint
sources and astrometry on the order of 10 microarcseconds. For jet studies in
particular, the next generation of instruments will bring us closer to the
event horizon of supermassive black holes such as Sgr A*, and the region where
jet launching must occur. But a new possibility to study microquasars in
general and jet physics in particular may also arise, using techniques similar
to those employed for finding faint exoplanets around stars. The compact,
steady jets observed in the hard state of X-ray binaries display a
flat/inverted spectrum from the lower radio wavelengths up through at least the
far-IR band. Somewhere above this band, a turnover is predicted where the jets
become optically thin, revealing a power-law spectrum. This break may have been
observed directly in GX339-4, but in most sources such a feature is likely
hidden under bright emission from the stellar companion or accretion disk
components. Detecting the exact location of this break would provide a new
constraint on our models of jet physics, since the break frequency is dependent
on the total power, as well as internal density and magnetic field.
Furthermore, knowing the break location combined with the spectral index of the
power-law would help constrain the amount of synchrotron emission contributed
by the jets to the X-ray bands. Along with a summary of some potential
observations requiring less optimal instrumental specifications, I will discuss
a technique which may enable us to discern the jet break, and the chances of
success based on theoretical models applied to some potential target sources.

positive map, weak majorization and entropic inequalities in the context of
detection of entanglement among bipartite quantum systems. First, basing on the
fact that any positive map $\Lambda:M_{d}(\mathbb{C})\to M_{d}(\mathbb{C})$ can
be written as the difference between two completely positive maps
$\Lambda=\Lambda_{1}-\Lambda_{2}$, we propose a possible way to generalize the
Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion. Then we present two methods of
derivation of some general classes of entropic inequalities useful for the
detection of entanglement. While the first one follows from the aforementioned
generalized majorization relation and the concept of the Schur--concave
decreasing functions, the second is based on some functional inequalities. What
is important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and
entropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states
with positive partial transposition when using indecomposable positive maps. We
also point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is
detected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\Lambda$, then
there exist entropic inequalities derived from $\Lambda$ (by both procedures)
that also detect this state. In this sense, they are equivalent to the
necessary criterion $[I\ot\Lambda](\varrho_{AB})\geq 0$. Moreover, our
inequalities provide a way of constructing multi--copy entanglement witnesses
and therefore are promising from the experimental point of view. Finally, we
discuss some of the derived inequalities in the context of recently introduced
protocol of state merging and possibility of approximating the mean value of a
linear entanglement witness.

interact with Kolmogorov turbulence. One-dimensional calculations using the
Linear Eddy Model of Kerstein (1991) elucidate three regimes of turbulent
burning. In the simplest case, large scale turbulence folds and deforms thin
laminar flamelets to produce a flame brush with a total burning rate given
approximately by the speed of turbulent fluctuations on the integral scale,
U_L. This is the regime where the supernova explosion begins and where most of
its pre-detonation burning occurs. As the density declines, turbulence starts
to tear the individual flamelets, making broader structures that move faster.
For a brief time, these turbulent flamelets are still narrow compared to their
spacing and the concept of a flame brush moving with an overall speed of U_L
remains valid. However, the typical width of the individual flamelets, which is
given by the condition that their turnover time equals their burning time,
continues to increase as the density declines. Eventually, mixed regions almost
as large as the integral scale itself are transiently formed. At that point, a
transition to detonation can occur. The conditions for such a transition are
explored numerically and it is estimated that the transition will occur for
densities near 1 x 10**7 g/cm**3, provided the turbulent speed on the integral
scale exceeds about 15% sonic. An example calculation shows the details of a
detonation actually developing.

effective temperatures between 7250 K and 9500 K. A comprehensive model atom
for Pr II/III is based on the measured and the predicted energy levels, in
total, 6708 levels of Pr II and Pr III. We describe calculations of the Pr II
energy levels and oscillator strengths for the transitions in Pr II and Pr III.
The influence of departures from LTE on Pr abundance determinations is
evaluated. At Teff >= 8000 K departures from LTE lead to overionization of Pr
II and to systematically depleted total absorption in the line and positive
abundance corrections. At the lower temperatures, different lines of Pr II may
be either weakened or amplified depending on the line strength. The non-LTE
effects strengthen the Pr III lines and lead to negative abundance corrections.
Non-LTE corrections grow with effective temperature for the Pr II lines, and,
in contrast, they decline for the Pr III lines. The Pr II/III model atom is
applied to determine the Pr abundance in the atmosphere of the roAp star HD
24712 from the lines of two ionization stages. In the chemically uniform
atmosphere with [Pr/H] = 3, the departures from LTE may explain only small part
(0.3 dex) of the difference between the LTE abundances derived from the Pr II
and Pr III lines (2 dex). We find that the lines of both ionization stages are
described for the vertical distribution of the praseodymium where the Pr
enriched layer with [Pr/H] > 4 exists in the outer atmosphere at log tau_5000 <
-4. The departures from LTE for Pr II/III are strong in the stratified
atmosphere and have the opposite sign for the Pr II and Pr III lines. Using the
revised partition function of Pr II and experimental transition probabilities,
we determine the solar non-LTE abundance of Pr as log (Pr/H) = -11.15\pm0.08.

These galaxies span ranges of almost three orders-of-magnitude in star
formation rate and over two orders-of-magnitude in stellar mass. We find that
the strongest interstellar absorption-lines are generally blueshifted relative
to the galaxy systemic velocity by ~50 to 300 km/s, implying the presence of
starburst-driven galactic outflows. The outflow velocites increase on-average
with the star formation rate and the star formation rate per unit mass. We find
that outflowing coronal-phase (T ~ several hundred thousand K) gas detected via
the OVI 1032 absorption line in nearly every galaxy. The kinematics of this
outflowing gas differs from the lower-ionization material, and agrees with
predictions for radiatively cooling gas (most likely created at the interface
between the hot outrushing gas traced by X-rays and cool ambient material).
Emission from the coronal gas is not generally detected, implying that
radiative cooling by this phase is not affecting the dynamics/energetics of the
wind. We find that the weaker interstellar absorption lines lie close to the
systemic velocity, implying that the outflowing gas has a lower column density
than the quiescent gas in the starburst. From direct observation below the
Lyman edge and from the small residual intensity at the core of the CII 1036
line, we conclude that the absolute escape fraction of ionizing radiation is
small (typically less than a few percent). This sample provides a unique window

Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope are modeled using dust
at two temperatures to probe the radial variation in dust composition in the
uppermost layers of protoplanetary disks. Most spectra indicating crystalline
silicates require Mg-rich minerals and silica, but a few suggest otherwise.
Spectra indicating abundant enstatite at higher temperatures also require
crystalline silicates at temperatures lower than those required for spectra
showing high abundance of other crystalline silicates. A few spectra show 10
micron complexes of very small equivalent width. They are fit well using
abundant crystalline silicates but very few large grains, inconsistent with the
expectation that low peak-to-continuum ratio of the 10 micron complex always
indicates grain growth. Most spectra in our sample are fit well without using
the opacities of large crystalline silicate grains. If large grains grow by
agglomeration of submicron grains of all dust types, the amorphous silicate
components of these aggregates must typically be more abundant than the
crystalline silicate components. Crystalline silicate abundances correlate
positively with other such abundances, suggesting that crystalline silicates
are processed directly from amorphous silicates and that neither forsterite,
enstatite, nor silica are intermediate steps when producing either of the other
two. Disks with more dust settling typically have greater crystalline
abundances. Large-grain abundance is somewhat correlated with greater settling
of disks. The lack of strong correlation is interpreted to mean that settling
of large grains is sensitive to individual disk properties. Lower-mass stars
have higher abundances of large grains in their inner regions.

five thermodynamically distinct phases. Thus the interpenetration mechanism
provides a simple route to generate multiple liquid phases in single-component

instabilities in cooling gaseous accretion discs. For low enough cooling rates
a quasi-steady configuration is reached, with the instability saturating at a
finite amplitude in a marginally stable disc. We find that the saturation
amplitude scales with the inverse square root of the cooling parameter beta =
t_cool / t_dyn, which indicates that the heating rate induced by the
instability is proportional to the energy density of the induced density waves.
We find that at saturation the energy dissipated per dynamical time by weak
shocks due is of the order of 20 per cent of the wave energy. From Fourier
analysis of the disc structure we find that while the azimuthal wavenumber is
roughly constant with radius, the mean radial wavenumber increases with radius,
with the dominant mode corresponding to the locally most unstable wavelength.
We demonstrate that the density waves excited in relatively low mass discs are
always close to co-rotation, deviating from it by approximately 10 per cent.
This can be understood in terms of the flow Doppler-shifted phase Mach number
-- the pattern speed self-adjusts so that the flow into spiral arms is always
sonic. This has profound effects on the degree to which transport through
self-gravity can be modelled as a viscous process. Our results thus provide (a)
a detailed description of how the self-regulation mechanism is established for
low cooling rates, (b) a clarification of the conditions required for
describing the transport induced by self-gravity through an effective
viscosity, (c) an estimate of the maximum amplitude of the density perturbation
before fragmentation occurs, and (d) a simple recipe to estimate the density
perturbation in different thermal regimes.

geometric framework is used to investigate effects of twisted magnetic flux

Frenet torsion is positive, the Riemann curvature is unstable, while the
negative torsion induces an stability when time $t\to{\infty}$. This enhances
the dynamo action inside the MFTs. The Riemann metric, depends on the radial
random flows along the poloidal and toroidal directions. The Anosov flows has
been applied by Arnold, Zeldovich, Ruzmaikin and Sokoloff [\textbf{JETP

Cat Map. It is easy to show that when the random radial flow vanishes, the
magnetic field vanishes, since the exponential Lyapunov stretches vanishes.
This is an example of the application of the Vishik's anti-fast dynamo theorem

applies from the ballistic to diffusive limits and provides a clear way to
compare performance in different dimensions. It also provides a physical
interpretation of the ""transport distribution,"" a quantity that arises in the
Boltzmann transport equation approach. Quantitative comparison of
thermoelectric coefficients in one, two, and three dimension shows that the

advantage of lower dimensionality, however, the packing density must be very
high, so the thicknesses of the quantum wells or wires must be small. The
potential benefits of engineering M(E) into a delta-function are also
investigated. When compared to a bulk semiconductor, we find the potential for
~50 % improvement in performance. The shape of M(E) improves as dimensionality
decreases, but lower dimensionality itself does not guarantee better
performance because it is controlled by both the shape and the magnitude of

argue that the only allowed possibilities are inflationary (albeit not
necessarily slow-roll) expansion or ekpyrotic contraction. Non-Gaussianities
offer many distinguish features. As usual with a small sound speed,
non-Gaussianity can be relatively large, around current sensitivity levels. For
DBI-like lagrangians, the amplitude is negative in the inflationary branch, and
can be either negative or positive in the ekpyrotic branch. Unlike the power
spectrum, the three-point amplitude displays a large tilt that, in the
expanding case, peaks on smallest scales. While the shape is predominantly of
the equilateral type in the inflationary branch, as in DBI inflation, it is of
the local form in the ekpyrotic branch. The tensor spectrum is also generically
far from scale invariant. In the contracting case, for instance, tensors are
strongly blue tilted, resulting in an unmeasurably small gravity wave amplitude
on cosmic microwave background scales.

an alternative to zero-inflated models to account for the preponderance of
zeros sometimes observed in transportation count data, such as the number of
accidents occurring on a roadway segment over some period of time. For this
accident-frequency case, zero-inflated models assume the existence of two
states: one of the states is a zero-accident count state, in which accident
probabilities are so low that they cannot be statistically distinguished from
zero, and the other state is a normal count state, in which counts can be
non-negative integers that are generated by some counting process, for example,
a Poisson or negative binomial. In contrast to zero-inflated models, Markov
switching models allow specific roadway segments to switch between the two
states over time. An important advantage of this Markov switching approach is
that it allows for the direct statistical estimation of the specific
roadway-segment state (i.e., zero or count state) whereas traditional
zero-inflated models do not. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach,
a two-state Markov switching negative binomial model (estimated with Bayesian
inference) and standard zero-inflated negative binomial models are estimated
using five-year accident frequencies on Indiana interstate highway segments. It
is shown that the Markov switching model is a viable alternative and results in

force, a discontinuity was recently observed at the supercoiling transition,
when a small plectoneme is suddenly formed. This can be understood as an abrupt
transition into a state in which stretched and plectonemic DNA coexist. We
argue that there should be discontinuities in both the extension and the torque
at the transition, and provide experimental evidence for both. To predict the
sizes of these discontinuities and how they change with the overall length of
DNA, we organize a theory for the coexisting plectonemic state in terms of four
length-independent parameters. We also test plectoneme theories, including our
own elastic rod simulation, finding discrepancies with experiment that can be
understood in terms of the four coexisting state parameters.

receives an error parameter 0 < eps < 1. The goal is then to output an
approximation with relative error at most eps to F_p = ||x||_p^p.
  Previously, it was known that polylogarithmic space (in the vector length n)
was achievable if and only if p <= 2. We make several new contributions in this
regime, including:
  (*) An optimal space algorithm for 0 < p < 2, which, unlike previous
algorithms which had optimal dependence on 1/eps but sub-optimal dependence on
n, does not rely on a generic pseudorandom generator.
  (*) A near-optimal space algorithm for p = 0 with optimal update and query

  (*) A near-optimal space algorithm for the ""distinct elements"" problem (p = 0

  (*) New 1-pass lower bounds to show optimality and near-optimality of our
algorithms, as well as of some previous algorithms (the ""AMS sketch"" for p = 2,

AWM 5. It has a small ($\sim8$ kpc) dense cool core with a temperature of
$\sim1.2$ keV and the temperature profile decreases at larger radii, from
$\sim3.5$ keV just outside the core to $\sim2$ keV at $\sim300$ kpc from the
center. The abundance distribution shows a ""hole"" in the central $\sim10$ kpc,
where the temperature declines sharply. An abundance of at least a few times
solar is observed $\sim15-20$ kpc from the center. The deprojected electron
density profile shows a break in slope at $\sim13$ kpc and can be fit by two
$\beta$-models, with $\beta=0.72_{-0.11}^{+0.16}$ and $r_c=5.7_{-1.5}^{+1.8}$
kpc, for the inner part, and $\beta=0.34\pm0.01$ and $r_c=31.3_{-5.5}^{+5.8}$
kpc, for the outer part. The mass fraction of hot gas is fairly flat in the
center and increases for $r>30$ kpc up to a maximum of $\sim6.5%$ at $r\sim380$
kpc. The gas cooling time within the central 30 kpc is smaller than a Hubble
time, although the temperature only declines in the central $\sim8$ kpc region.
This discrepancy suggests that an existing cooling core has been partially
re-heated. In particular, thermal conduction could have been a significant
source of re-heating. In order for heating due to conduction to balance cooling
due to emission of X-rays, the conductivity must be suppressed by a large
factor (at least $\sim100$). Past AGN activity (still visible as a radio source
in the center of the group) is however the most likely source that re-heated
the central regions of AWM 5.

biomass pyramids. The first class of models exploits well-mixing of predators
and prey, the second class has a refuge (with explicit size) for the prey to
hide, and the third class incorporates the immigration of prey. Our models
indicate that inverted biomass pyramids occur when the prey growth rate, prey
carrying capacity, biomass conversion efficiency, the predator life span, or
the immigration rate of prey fish is sufficiently large. In the second class,
we discuss three hypotheses on how refuge size can impact the amount of prey
available to predators. By explicitly incorporating a refuge size, these can
more realistically model predator-prey interactions than refgue models with
implicit refuge size.

a single player are discussed. Between each interaction it is assumed that he
follows a straight line and his motion is characterized by viscous, pushing and
pedestrian like force. A random force is supposed to influence only the
trajectory direction after each interaction. Furthermore it is assumed that the
time step between each interaction is a random variable belonging to a Gaussian
distribution. The main criteria is a selection of a function correlated to the
strategy of the player, around which, in a necessarily randomly way, a tactic
function should be added. The strategy depends on the players role: for the
numerical simulations in this paper, a forward player was selected, with the
average target to score. So it is straightforward to assume that the line
direction joining the player position and a point related to the goal, would be
the main strategy objective function around which a random angle A rand,
expression of the tactic objective function, influencing the direction selected
by the player until a next interaction could be introduced. The comparison
between both single and multiple experimental paths and figures obtained by the

the effective currents and sources are calculated in an explicit form. In the

no thermal expansion over a wide range of temperature. It is clear that this is
the result of an anomalous contraction upon heating which counteracts the
normal thermal expansion arising from the anharmonicity of lattice vibrations.
This anomalous contraction seems to be related to the alloys' magnetic
properties, since the effect vanishes at a temperature close to the Curie
temperature. However, despite many years of intensive research, a widely
accepted microscopic theory of the Invar effect in face-centered-cubic Fe-Ni
alloys is still lacking. Here we present a simple theory of the Invar effect in
these alloys based on Ising magnetism, ab initio total energy calculations, and
the Debye-Gruneisen model. We show that this theory accurately reproduces
several well known properties of these materials, including Guillaume's famous
plot1 of the thermal expansion coefficient as a function of the concentration
of nickel. Within the same framework, we are able to account in a
straightforward way for experimentally observed deviations from Vegard's law.
Our approach supports the idea that the lattice constant is governed by a few
parameters, including the fraction of iron-iron nearest-neighbour pairs.

sequences present in a database, but, in general, only a few ones are
interesting for the user. Languages based on regular expressions (RE) have been
proposed to restrict frequent sequences to the ones that satisfy user-specified
constraints. Although the support of a sequence is computed as the number of
data-sequences satisfying a pattern with respect to the total number of
data-sequences in the database, once regular expressions come into play, new
approaches to the concept of support are needed. For example, users may be
interested in computing the support of the RE as a whole, in addition to the
one of a particular pattern. Also, when the items are frequently updated, the
traditional way of counting support in sequential pattern mining may lead to
incorrect (or, at least incomplete), conclusions. The problem gets more
involved if we are interested in categorical sequential patterns. In light of
the above, in this paper we propose to revise the classic notion of support in
sequential pattern mining, introducing the concept of temporal support of
regular expressions, intuitively defined as the number of sequences satisfying
