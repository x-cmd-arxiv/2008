present 197 type II Cepheids and 83 anomalous Cepheids in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). The sample of type II Cepheids consists of 64 BL Her stars, 96 W
Vir stars and 37 RV Tau stars. Anomalous Cepheids are divided into 62
fundamental-mode and 21 first-overtone pulsators. These are the largest samples
of such types of variable stars detected anywhere outside the Galaxy.
  We present the period-luminosity and color-magnitude diagrams of stars in the
sample. If the boundary period between BL Her and W Vir stars is adopted at 4
days, both groups differ significantly in (V-I) colors. We identify a group of
16 peculiar W Vir stars with different appearance of the light curves, brighter
and bluer than ordinary stars of that type. Four of these peculiar W Vir stars
show additional eclipsing modulation superimposed on the pulsation light
curves. Four other stars of that type show long-period secondary variations
which may be ellipsoidal modulations. It suggests that peculiar W Vir subgroup
may be related to binarity. In total, we identified seven type II Cepheids
simultaneously exhibiting eclipsing variations which is a very large fraction
compared to classical Cepheids in the LMC. We discuss diagrams showing Fourier
parameters of the light curve decomposition against periods. Three sharp
features interpreted as an effect of resonances between radial modes are
detectable in these diagrams for type II Cepheids.

anomalous U(1) and Stueckelberg axions for anomaly cancellation, generalizing
similar non-supersymmetric constructions. The model, built by a bottom-up
approach, is expected to capture the low-energy supersymmetric description of
axionic symmetries in theories with gauged anomalous abelian interactions,
previously explored in the non-supersymmetric case for scenarios with
intersecting branes. The choice of a USSM-like superpotential, with one extra
singlet superfield and an extra abelian symmetry, allows a physical axion-like
particle in the spectrum. We describe some general features of this
construction and in particular the modification of the dark-matter sector which
involves both the axion and several neutralinos with an axino component. The
axion is expected to be very light in the absence of phases in the
superpotential but could acquire a mass which can also be in the few GeV range
or larger. In particular, the gauging of the anomalous symmetry allows
independent mass/coupling interaction to the gauge fields of this particle, a
feature which is absent in traditional (invisible) axion models. We comment on
the general implications of our study for the signature of moduli from string
theory due to the presence of these anomalous symmetries.

contextuality entails in turn a structural-relational conception of quantal

suggested that contextuality, if considered as a conditionalization preparation
procedure of the object to be measured, naturally leads to a separable concept
of reality whose elements are experienced as distinct, well-localized objects
having determinate properties. In this connection, we find it necessary to
distinguish the meaning of the term reality from the criterion of reality for
us. The implications of the latter considerations for the notion of objectivity

structure and that are natural if the dependence with respect to the structure
is taken into account.
  The question of existence of such a quantization was addressed in a series of
papers in the context of projective geometry, using the framework of
Thomas-Whitehead connections (see Bordemann, Hansoul and Fox). Recently, we
recovered these existence results, using the theory of Cartan projective
connections.
  In the present work, we show that our method can be adapted to
pseudo-conformal geometry to yield the so-called natural and conformally
invariant quantization for arbitrary symbols, still outside some critical
situations. Our method is general enough to analyze the problem of invariant
quantizations in the context of manifolds with irreducible parabolic
geometries.

where network nodes are aware of information delivered and thus can not only
forward data packets but may also perform information processing. In many
situations, the quality of service (QoS) in information-driven networks is
provisioned with the redundancy in information. Traditional performance models
generally adopt evaluation measures suitable for packet-oriented service
guarantee, such as packet delay, throughput, and packet loss rate. These
performance measures, however, do not align well with the actual need of
information-driven networks. New performance measures and models for
information-driven networks, despite their importance, have been mainly blank,
largely because information processing is clearly application dependent and
cannot be easily captured within a generic framework. To fill the vacancy, we
present a new performance evaluation framework particularly tailored for
information-driven networks, based on the recent development of stochastic
network calculus. We analyze the QoS with respect to information delivery and
study the scheduling problem with the new performance metrics. Our analytical
framework can be used to calculate the network capacity in information delivery
and in the meantime to help transmission scheduling for a large body of systems
where QoS is stochastically guaranteed with the redundancy in information.

  A simple algorithm for approximating a minimum $k$-way cut is to iteratively
increase the number of components of the graph by $h-1$, where $2 \le h \le k$,
until the graph has $k$ components. The approximation ratio of this algorithm
is known for $h \le 3$ but is open for $h \ge 4$.
  In this paper, we consider a general algorithm that iteratively increases the

local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) constitute a proper
subset of the class of separable operations. Recently, Gheorghiu and Griffiths
found that LOCC and general separable operations are equally powerful for
transformations between bipartite pure states. In this letter we extend this
comparison to mixed states and show that in general separable operations are
strictly stronger than LOCC when transforming a mixed state to a pure entangled
state. A remarkable consequence of our finding is the existence of entanglement
monotone which may increase under separable operations.

action of the torus T^(n+1). The toric action lifts onto the Swann bundle of
the quaternionic Kahler space to a tri-holomorphic action that commutes with
the standard H* action on the bundle. By matching Pedersen and Poon's
generalized Gibbons-Hawking Ansatz description of the total space with the
Swann picture we extract the local geometry of the quaternionic Kahler base.
Specifically, we obtain explicit expressions for the quaternionic Kahler metric
and Sp(1) connection in terms of a set of reduced Higgs fields and connection
1-forms that satisfy a reduced Bogomol'nyi-type equation. We find, moreover,
that these Higgs fields can be derived from a single function V satisfying a
system of linear second-order partial differential constraints. In four
dimensions, corresponding to the case of self-dual Einstein manifolds with two
commuting Killing vector fields, our formulas coincide with those obtained
through a different approach by Calderbank and Pedersen. Finally, we show how
to construct explicit solutions to the reduced Bogomol'nyi and V equations by
means of Lindstrom and Rocek's generalized Legendre transform construction for
a large class of quaternionic Kahler manifolds related to the c-map.

formation. We perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellar
medium (ISM) simulations in which supernova rates and vertical gas column
densities are systematically varied based on the Schmidt-Kennicutt law. Our
simulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow the
hydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the ISM. At
a given supernova rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed and
velocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density,
indicating that both thermal and turbulent pressures are nearly constant in the
midplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. In contrast, across
our four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times the
Galactic supernova rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in the
range 4-6 km/s. Hence, gas averaged over ~100 pc regions follows an effective
equation of state that is close to isothermal. Simulated H I emission lines
have widths of 10-18 km/s, comparable to observed values. In our highest
supernova rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressure
on large scales is >~4 times higher than the thermal pressure. We find a tight
correlation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over ~100 pc
regions in the midplane of each model, as well as across the four ISM models.
We construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic arguments
and explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ISM simulations. The subgrid
model provides a simple yet physically motivated way to include supernova
feedback in cosmological simulations.

$B_c$ decays into $D, D^*, D_s, D_s^*, \eta_c, J/\psi, B, B^*, B_s, B_s^*$
mesons. The form factors in the spacelike region $q^2<0$ are directly
evaluated. To extrapolate the form factors to the full kinematic region, we fit
the form factors by adopting a three-parameter form from the spacelike region.
$b\to u,d,s$ transition form factors at maximally recoiling point ($q^2=0$) are
smaller than $b\to c$ and $c\to d,s$ transition form factors, while the $b\to
d,s,c$ form factors at zero recoiling point are close to each other. In the
fitting procedure, we find the parameters for the form factors $A_2(B_c\to
B^*)$ and $A_2(B_c\to B^*_s)$ strongly depend on the decay constants of $B^*$
and $B_s^*$ mesons. Fortunately, the semileptonic and nonleptonic $B_c$ decays
are not sensitive to these form factors. With the form factors, we also
investigate the branching fractions, polarizations of the semileptonic $B_c\to
Ml\nu$ decays. Semileptonic $B_c\to (\eta_c,J/\psi)l\nu$ and $B_c\to
(B_s,B_s^*)l\nu$ decays have much larger branching fractions than $B_c\to
(D,D^*,B,B^*)l\nu$. In the three kinds of $B_c\to Vl\nu$ decays, contributions
from the longitudinal polarized vector is comparable with those from the
transversely polarized vector. These predictions will be tested at the ongoing

We show that, for a
single scalar field potential with a true and a false vacuum, there are four
types of tunneling, depending on the properties of the potential. A general
tunneling process involves a combination of thermal (Gibbons-Hawking
temperature) fluctuation part way up the barrier followed by quantum tunneling.
The thin-wall approximation is a special limit of the case (of only quantum
tunneling) where inside the nucleation bubble is the true vacuum while the
outside reaches the false vacuum. Hawking-Moss tunneling is the (only thermal
fluctuation) limit of the case where the inside of the bubble does not reach
the true vacuum at the moment of its creation, and the outside is cut off by
the de Sitter horizon before it reaches the false vacuum. We estimate the
corrections to the Hawking-Moss formula, which can be large. In all cases, we
see that the bounce of the Euclidean action decreases rapidly as the vacuum
energy density increases, signaling that the tunneling is not exponentially
suppressed. In some sense, this phenomenon may be interpreted as a finite
temperature effect due to the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter
space. As an application, we discuss the implication of this tunneling property
to the cosmic landscape.
