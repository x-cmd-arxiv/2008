sources for which there exist pairs of spectroscopic observations (with a
maximum separation in time of ~700 days) covering a wavelength range of
3900-8900 angstrom. To obtain a reliable repeatability measurement between each

of two. From these data we find no obvious continuum and emission-line
variability in the narrow-line AGNs on average -- the spectroscopic variability
of the continuum is 0.07+/-0.26 mag in the g band and, for the emission-line
ratios log10([NII]/Halpha) and log10([OIII]/Hbeta), the variability is
0.02+/-0.03 dex and 0.06+/-0.08 dex, respectively. From the continuum
variability measurement we set an upper limit on the ratio between the flux of

ranging from the demonstration of number-phase uncertainty relation to quantum

tunnel coupled interacting bosonic systems, we propose a device that is the
quantum optical analog of a Josephson interferometer. It consists of two
coherently driven linear optical cavities connected via a central cavity with a
single-photon nonlinearity. The Josephson-like oscillations in the light
emitted from the central cavity as a function of the phase difference between
two pumping fields can be suppressed by increasing the strength of the
nonlinear coupling. Remarkably, we find that in the limit of ultra-strong
interactions in the center-cavity, the coupled system maps on to an effective
Jaynes-Cummings system with a nonlinearity determined by the tunnel coupling
strength. In the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear
waveguides, the degree of photon antibunching from the nonlinear cavity
provides an excellent measure of the transition to the nonlinear regime where
Josephson oscillations are suppressed.

superexchange in the orbital sector. The paradigm of a hole propagating by its
coupling to quantum fluctuations, known from the spin t-J model, then no longer
applies. We find instead that when one of the two orbital flavors is immobile,
as in the Falicov-Kimball model, trapped orbital polarons coexist with free
hole propagation emerging from the effective three-site hopping in the regime
of large on-site Coulomb interaction U. The spectral functions are found
analytically in this case within the retraceable path approximation in one and
two dimensions. On the contrary, when both of the orbitals are active, as in
the model for $t_{2g}$ electrons in two dimensions, we find propagating
polarons with incoherent scattering dressing the moving hole and renormalizing
the quasiparticle dispersion. Here, the spectral functions, calculated using
the self-consistent Born approximation, are anisotropic and depend on the
orbital flavor. Unbiased conclusions concerning the spectral properties are
established by comparing the above results for the orbital t-J models with
those obtained using the variational cluster approximation or exact
diagonalization for the corresponding Hubbard models. The present work makes
predictions concerning the essential features of photoemission spectra of

centrality in Au-Au collisions at \sqrt(s)_{NN}= 200 GeV can be explained with
a superposition of emission from a hadron gas at full chemical equilibrium
(core) and from nucleon-nucleon collisions at the boundary (corona) of the
overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei. This model nicely accounts for
the enhancement of phi meson and strange particle production as a function of
centrality observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions at that energy. The
enhancement is mainly a geometrical effect, that is the increasing weight of
the core with respect to corona for higher centrality, while strangeness
canonical suppression in the core seems to play a role only in very peripheral
collisions. This model, if confirmed at lower energy, would settle the
long-standing problem of strangeness under-saturation in relativistic heavy ion
collisions, parametrized by $\gs$. Furthermore, it would give a unique tool to
locate the onset of deconfinement in nuclear collisions both as a function of
energy and centrality if this is to be associated to the onset of the formation
of a fully equilibrated core.

sample of MIR-selected galaxies at 15um and we also obtain 15um flux densities
for a sample of LBGs at z=1 already observed at 24um with Spitzer/MIPS. Number
counts for the MIR-selected sample show a bump around a 15um flux density of
0.2mJy that can be attributed to galaxies at z>0.4 and at z>0.8 for the fainter
part of the bump. This bump seems to be shifted as compared to other works and
a possible origin can be the Cosmic variance. Thanks to this dataset, we have
tested, on the two above samples at z=1, the validity of the conversions from
monochromatic luminosities nu.f(nu) at a rest-frame wavelength of 8um by a
comparison with total dust luminosities estimated from Spitzer rest-frame 12um
data that we use as a reference. We find that the 8um dust luminosities are not
all consistent and that some of them are better when compared to L(dust)
evaluated from longer wavelength luminosities. We also find that the rest-frame
8um luminosities provide globally good estimates of L(dust). By comparing our
data for the two samples to several libraries of SEDs, we find that models can
explain the diversity of the observed f(24)/f(15) ratio quite reasonably for
the MIR-selected sample and better for the LBG sample which are less dispersed
than the MIR selection. However, when we analyse the luminosity dependence of
this ratio, we find important discrepancies. Finally, we revisit the evolution
of L(dust)/L(UV) ratio with the redshift z by re-calibrating previous L(dust)
at z=2 based on our results and added new data points at higher redshifts. The
decreasing trend is amplified as compared to the previous estimate.

a one-parameter description of correlated states. In this paper we use a
translated entropic index: $1 - q \to q$ . The essence of this translation is
to improve the mathematical symmetry of the q-algebra and make q directly
proportional to the nonlinear coupling. A conjugate transformation is defined
$\hat q \equiv \frac{{- 2q}}{{2 + q}}$ which provides a dual mapping between
the heavy-tail q-Gaussian distributions, whose translated q parameter is
between $ - 2 < q < 0$, and the compact-support q-Gaussians, between $0 < q <
\infty $ . This conjugate transformation is used to extend the definition of
the q-Fourier transform to the domain of compact support. A conjugate q-Fourier
transform is proposed which transforms a q-Gaussian into a conjugate $\hat q$
-Gaussian, which has the same exponential decay as the Fourier transform of a
power-law function. The nonlinear statistical coupling is defined such that the
conjugate pair of q-Gaussians have equal strength but either couple
(compact-support) or decouple (heavy-tail) the statistical states. Many of the
nonextensive entropy applications can be shown to have physical parameters
proportional to the nonlinear statistical coupling.

conductance (i.e. a sparse cut) by adaptively exploring part of a large graph
$G$, starting from a specified vertex. For the algorithm to be local, its
complexity must be bounded in terms of the size of the set that it outputs,
with at most a weak dependence on the number $n$ of vertices in $G$. Previous
local partitioning algorithms find sparse cuts using random walks and
personalized PageRank. In this paper, we introduce a randomized local
partitioning algorithm that finds a sparse cut by simulating the {\em
volume-biased evolving set process}, which is a Markov chain on sets of
vertices. We prove that for any set of vertices $A$ that has conductance at
most $\phi$, for at least half of the starting vertices in $A$ our algorithm
will output (with probability at least half), a set of conductance
$O(\phi^{1/2} \log^{1/2} n)$. We prove that for a given run of the algorithm,
the expected ratio between its computational complexity and the volume of the
set that it outputs is $O(\phi^{-1/2} polylog(n))$. In comparison, the best
previous local partitioning algorithm, due to Andersen, Chung, and Lang, has
the same approximation guarantee, but a larger ratio of $O(\phi^{-1}
polylog(n))$ between the complexity and output volume. Using our local
partitioning algorithm as a subroutine, we construct a fast algorithm for
finding balanced cuts. Given a fixed value of $\phi$, the resulting algorithm
has complexity $O((m+n\phi^{-1/2}) polylog(n))$ and returns a cut with
conductance $O(\phi^{1/2} \log^{1/2} n)$ and volume at least $v_{\phi}/2$,

as it diffuses, at the equilibrium regime, along uniformly random
(Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi) and scale-free (Barab\'asi-Albert) networks. The degree of
preservation is quantified in terms of the Pearson cross-correlation between
the original signal and the derivative of the signals appearing at each node
along time. Several interesting results are reported. First, the fact that
quite distinct signals are typically obtained at different nodes in the
considered networks implies mean-field approaches to be completely inadequate.
It has also been found that the peak and lag of the similarity time-signatures
obtained for each specific node are strongly related to the respective distance
between that node and the source node. Such a relationship tends to decrease
with the average degree of the networks. Also, in the case of the lag, a less
intense relationship is verified for scale-free networks. No relationship was

An interest in eccentric and zoom-whirl orbits has ironically inspired the
focus of this paper: the constant radius orbits. When black hole spins are
misaligned, the constant radius orbits are not circles but rather lie on the
surface of a sphere and have acquired the name ""spherical orbits"". The
spherical orbits are significant as they energetically frame the distribution
of all orbits. In addition, each unstable spherical orbit is asymptotically
approached by an orbit that whirls an infinite number of times, known as a
homoclinic orbit. A homoclinic trajectory is an infinite whirl limit of the
zoom-whirl spectrum and has a further significance as the separatrix between
inspiral and plunge for eccentric orbits. We work in the context of two
spinning black holes of comparable mass as described in the 3PN Hamiltonian
with spin-orbit coupling included. As such, the results could provide a testing
ground of the accuracy of the PN expansion. Further, the spherical orbits could
provide useful initial data for numerical relativity. Finally, we comment that
the spinning black hole pairs should give way to chaos around the homoclinic
orbit when spin-spin coupling is incorporated.

studied by Mattingly and the first author of this paper [Iyer and Mattingly

system for the Burgers equations shocks almost surely in finite time. In
contrast to the full expected value, the empirical mean $\frac{1}{N}\sum_1^N$
does not regularize the system enough to ensure a time global solution. To
avoid these shocks, we consider a resetting procedure, which at first sight
should have no regularizing effect at all. However, we prove that this

parabola and two sinusoidal variations, with cycle lengths of $P_3$=15.8 yr and
$P_4$=9.1 yr and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=77 s and $K_4$=23 s, respectively.
The continuous period decrease with a rate of $-8.28\times10^{-9}$ d yr$^{-1}$

components of the period change, apsidal motion and magnetic period modulation
can be ruled out. The most reasonable explanation of both cyclical variations

phase from face centred cubic solid to liquid on the size dependence of self
diffusivity of solutes through detailed molecular dynamics simulations on
binary mixtures consisting of a larger solvent and a smaller solute interacting
via Lennard-Jones potential. The effect of change in density during the
solid-liquid transition as well as in the solid and the liquid phase itself
have been studied through two sets of simulations one at fixed density(NVE)and
another at variable density(NPT). A size dependent diffusivity maximum is seen
in both solid and liquid phases at most densities except at low liquid
densities. Two distinct regimes may be identified : linear and anomalous
regimes. It is seen that the effect of solid to liquid transition is to shift
the diffusivity maximum to smaller sizes of the solutes and decrease the height
of the maximum. This is attributed to the predominant influence of disorder and
relatively weaker influence of density. The latter shifts the diffusivity
maximum towards larger solute size while the former does exactly the opposite.
Interestingly, we find that lower densities lead to weaker diffusivity maximum.
We report for the first time for systems with large solute-solvent interaction
strength, $\epsilon_{uv}$, multiple diffusivity maximum is seen as a function
of the solute size. The origin of this is not clear. A remarkable difference in
the ballistic-diffusive transition is seen between solutes from the linear
regime and anomalous regime. It is found that this transition is sharp for
solutes from anomalous regime. This provides interesting insight into motion of
anomalous regime solutes. Apart from these, we report several properties which
are different for the linear and anomalous regime solutes.

compressible systems are degenerate when vacuum state appears. We study
initial-boundary-value problems for such systems for both bounded spatial
domains or periodic domains. The dynamics of weak solutions and vacuum states
are investigated rigorously.
  First, it is proved that the entropy weak solutions for general large initial
data satisfying finite initial entropy exist globally in time. Next, for more
regular initial data, there is a global entropy weak solution which is unique
and regular with well-defined velocity field for short time, and the interface
of initial vacuum propagates along particle path during this time period. Then,
it is shown that for any global entropy weak solution, any (possibly existing)
vacuum state must vanish within finite time. The velocity (even if regular
enough and well-defined) blows up in finite time as the vacuum states vanish.
Furthermore, after the vanishing of vacuum states, the global entropy weak
solution becomes a strong solution and tends to the non-vacuum equilibrium
state exponentially in time.

An universal behavior
observed is that self diffusivity exhibits a maximum as a function of the size
of the diffusant when the diffusant is confined to a medium, as a result of
what is known as the Levitation Effect. Such a maximum in self diffusivity has
been seen in widely differing medium : microporous solids, dense liquids and
close-packed solids, ions in polar solvents, etc. The effect arises because the
forces exerted on the diffusant by the medium in which it is confined is a
minimum for the size of the diffusant for which self diffusivity is a maximum.
We report here simulations on a diatomic species confined to the cages of
zeolite Y. Several different simulations in which the two atoms of the model
diatomic species interact with equal strength(example, $O_2$, the symmetric
case) and with unequal interaction strengths (example, $CO$, asymmetric case)
are modeled here. Further, the bond length of the diatomic species is varied.
Our results for the symmetric case shows that self diffusivity is maximum for a
large enough bond length which fits snugly into the 12-ring window of zeolite
Y. For weakly asymmetric case, a weak maximum is seen as a function of the bond
length of the diatomic species. However, for strongly asymmetric case, no
maximum in self diffusivity is seen for all the bond lengths studied. This
demonstrates close relation between symmetry and the diffusivity maximum and
provides a direct evidence for the need of force cancellation to observe the
Levitation Effect.

quantum entanglement between gauge fields in two complementary regions of space

certain way. In the extended Hilbert space, the entanglement entropy can be
partially interpreted as the classical Shannon entropy of the flux of the gauge
fields through the boundary between the two regions. Such an extension leads to
a reduction procedure which can be easily implemented in lattice simulations by
constructing lattices with special topology. This enables us to measure the
entanglement entropy in lattice Monte-Carlo simulations. On the simplest
example of Z2 lattice gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions we demonstrate the
relation between entanglement entropy and the classical entropy of the field
flux. For SU(2) lattice gauge theory in four dimensions, we find a signature of
non-analytic dependence of the entanglement entropy on the size of the region.

during May and July 2006. We study the magnetar's pulse-energy distributions
which are found to be very peculiar as they are changing on time-scales of days
and cannot be fit by a single statistical model. The magnetar exhibits strong
spiky single giant-pulse-like subpulses, but they do not fit the definition of
the giant pulse or giant micropulse phenomena. Measurements of the
longitude-resolved modulation index reveal a high degree of intensity
fluctuations on day-to-day time-scales and dramatic changes across pulse phase.
We find the frequency evolution of the modulation index values differs
significantly from what is observed in normal radio pulsars. We find that no
regular drifting subpulse phenomenon is present at any of the observed
frequencies at any observing epoch. However, we find a quasi-periodicity of the
subpulses present in the majority of the observing sessions. A correlation
analysis indicates a relationship between components from different
frequencies. We discuss the results of our analysis in light of the emission
properties of normal radio pulsars and a recently proposed model which takes
radio emission from magnetars into consideration.

with particle conversion. In such systems particles of one kind can convert to
another kind and the total number of particles varies in time. The theory thus
extends the scope of the available and successful multiconfigurational
time-dependent Hartree methods -- which were solely formulated for and applied
to systems with a fixed number of particles -- to new physical systems and
problems. As a guiding example we treat explicitly a system where bosonic atoms
can combine to form bosonic molecules and vise versa. In the theory for
particle conversion, the time-dependent many-particle wavefunction is written
as a sum of configurations made of a different number of particles, and
assembled from sets of atomic and molecular orbitals. Both the expansion
coefficients and the orbitals forming the configurations are time-dependent
quantities that are fully determined according to the Dirac-Frenkel
time-dependent variational principle. Particular attention is paid to the
reduced density matrices of the many-particle wavefunction that appear in the
theory and enter the equations of motion. There are two kinds of reduced
density matrices: particle-conserving reduced density matrices which directly
only couple configurations with the same number of atoms and molecules, and
particle non-conserving reduced density matrices which couple configurations
with a different number of atoms and molecules. Closed-form and compact
equations of motion are derived for contact as well as general two-body
interactions, and their properties are analyzed and discussed.

precision of sigma_cz~2000 km/sec. We find that 'dusty red galaxies' and
'optically passive spirals' in A901/2 are largely the same phenomenon, and that
they form stars at a substantial rate, which is only 4x lower than that in blue
spirals at fixed mass. This star formation is more obscured than in blue
galaxies and its optical signatures are weak. They appear predominantly in the
stellar mass range of log M*/Msol=[10,11] where they constitute over half of
the star-forming galaxies in the cluster; they are thus a vital ingredient for
understanding the overall picture of star formation quenching in clusters. We
find that the mean specific SFR of star-forming galaxies in the cluster is
clearly lower than in the field, in contrast to the specific SFR properties of
blue galaxies alone, which appear similar in cluster and field. Such a rich red
spiral population is best explained if quenching is a slow process and
morphological transformation is delayed even more. At log M*/Msol<10, such
galaxies are rare, suggesting that their quenching is fast and accompanied by
morphological change. We note, that edge-on spirals play a minor role; despite

situations is described by means of a tight-binding model. We present results
for the self-consistent order parameter and current profiles within the sample.
These profiles illustrate a crossover from a quasi-equilibrium to a strong
non-equilibrium situation when increasing the interface transparencies and the
applied voltages. We analyze in detail the behavior of the non-local
conductance in these two different regimes. While in quasi-equilibrium
conditions this can be expressed as the difference between elastic cotunneling
and crossed Andreev transmission coefficients, in a general situation
additional contributions due to the voltage dependence of the self-consistent
order parameter have to be taken into account. The present results provide a
first step towards a self-consistent theory of non-local transport including
non-equilibrium effects and describe qualitatively a recent experiment [Phys.

axisymmetric against expectations in a self-gravity axisymmetric disc. However,
this lopsidedness can be explained in terms of intergalactic accretion flows,
which produce non-axisymmetric pressure on the disc. This mechanism could be
also responsible for the formation of a warp.
  METHODS. We analytically derive the relationship between the disc density and
the self-gravity and external pressure.
  RESULTS. The same scenario of accretion as we proposed years ago to explain
the formation of the warp explains the azimuthal dependence of the density and
its scaleheight, with minimum/maximum in the positions of maximum amplitude of
the warp (phi=95 deg. and 275 deg.), as expected from its pressure
distribution.

about starkly different conclusions. As a specific example, this contrast is

A complex multi-cluster system at z~0.165 has been the subject of an 80-orbit
F606W HST/ACS mosaic covering the full 0.5x0.5 (~5x5 Mpc^2) span of the
supercluster. Extensive multiwavelength observations with XMM-Newton, GALEX,
Spitzer, 2dF, GMRT, and the 17-band COMBO-17 photometric redshift survey
complement the HST imaging. Our survey goals include simultaneously linking
galaxy morphology with other observables such as age, star-formation rate,
nuclear activity, and stellar mass. In addition, with the multiwavelength
dataset and new high resolution mass maps from gravitational lensing, we are
able to disentangle the large-scale structure of the system. By examining all
aspects of environment we will be able to evaluate the relative importance of
the dark matter halos, the local galaxy density, and the hot X-ray gas in
driving galaxy transformation. This paper describes the HST imaging, data
reduction, and creation of a master catalogue. We perform Sersic fitting on the
HST images and conduct associated simulations to quantify completeness. In
addition, we present the COMBO-17 photometric redshift catalogue and estimates
of stellar masses and star-formation rates for this field. We define galaxy and
cluster sample selection criteria which will be the basis for forthcoming
science analyses, and present a compilation of notable objects in the field.
Finally, we describe the further multiwavelength observations and announce
public access to the data and catalogues.

log(Mstellar/Mo)=9.45) and turbulent phase that is found to be rotating on
large spatial scales. We identified two unusual properties of
J033241.88-274853.9. (1) The spatial distributions of the ionized gaseous and
young stars show a strong decoupling; while almost no stars can be detected in
the southern part down to the very deep detection limit of ACS/UDF images,
significant emission from the [OII] ionized gas is detected. (2) We detect an
excess of velocity dispersion in the southern part of J033241.88-274853.9 in
comparison to expectations from a rotating disk model. We considered two disk
formation scenarios, depending on the gaseous phase geometry. In the first one,
we examined whether J033241.88-274853.9 could be a young rotating disk that has
been recently collapsed from a pre-existing, very gas-rich rotating disk. This
scenario requires two (unknown) additional assumptions to explain the
decoupling between the distribution of stars and gas and the excess of velocity
dispersion in the same region. In a second scenario, we examine whether
J033241.88-274853.9 could be a merger remnant of two gas-rich disks. In this
case, the asymmetry observed between the gas and star distributions, as well as
the excess of velocity dispersion, find a common explanation. Shocks produced
during the merger in this region can be ionized easily and heat the gas while
preventing star formation. This makes this scenario more satisfactory than the
collapse of a pre-existing, gas-rich rotating disk.

  Motivated by an application of these structures in key predistribution for
wireless sensor networks, we define the $k$-hop coverage of a distinct
difference configuration to be the number of distinct vectors that can be
expressed as the sum of $k$ or fewer difference vectors. This is an important
parameter when distinct difference configurations are used in the wireless
sensor application, as this parameter describes the density of nodes that can
be reached by a short secure path in the network. We provide upper and lower
bounds for the $k$-hop coverage of a distinct difference configuration with $m$
points, and exploit a connection with $B_{h}$ sequences to construct
configurations with maximal $k$-hop coverage. We also construct distinct
difference configurations that enable all small vectors to be expressed as the

the environments and typical galaxies in which massive stars are formed. Two
main obstacles remain to be crossed before the full potential of GRBs as probes
of massive stars can be harvested: i) we need to build more complete and well
understood samples in order not to be fooled by biases, and ii) we need to
understand to which extent GRBs may be intrinsically biased in the sense that
they are only formed by a limited subset of massive stars defined by most
likely a restricted metallicity interval. We describe the status of an ongoing
effort to build a more complete sample of long-duration GRBs with measured
redshifts. Already now we can conclude that the environments of GRB progenitors
are very diverse with metallicities ranging from solar to a hundredth solar and
extinction ranging from none to A_V>5 mag. We have also identified a sightline

the Gogny D1S force. We compare the results with the shape-phase transition
predicted by the collective hamiltonian model and with the experimental data.
Our calculations do not support the existence of a first order phase transition
in these isotopic chains in the viewpoint of the Bohr hamiltonian neither the
interpretation of the nuclei N=90 as critical points.

Sci., 9 (2010), 785-813",,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove that some Riemannian manifolds with boundary under an explicit
integral pinching are spherical space forms. Precisely, we show that
3-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, positive
scalar curvature and an explicit integral pinching between the $L^2$-norm of
their scalar curvature and the $L^2$-norm of their Ricci tensor are spherical
space forms with totally geodesic boundary. Moreover, we prove also that
4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with umbilic boundary, positive Yamabe
invariant and an explicit integral pinching between the total integral of their
$(Q,T)$-curvature and the $L^2$-norm of their Weyl curvature are spherical
space forms with totally geodesic boundary. As a consequence of our work, we
show that a certain conformally invariant operator which plays an important
role in Conformal Geometry has a trivial kernel and is non-negative if the
Yamabe invariant is positive and verifies a pinching condition together with
the total integral of the $(Q,T)$-curvature. As an application of the latter
spectral analysis, we show the existence of conformal metrics with constant
$Q$-curvature, constant $T$-curvature, and zero mean curvature under the latter
assumptions.

study a first-passage problem of mortal random walkers in a confined
two-dimensional geometry. We provide an exact expression for the encounter
probability of two walkers, which is evaluated in limiting cases and checked
against extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the continuum
limit which is approached very slowly, with corrections that vanish
logarithmically with the lattice size. We then examine the influence of the
shape of the lattice on the first-passage probability, where we focus on the
aspect ratio dependence: Distorting the lattice always reduces the encounter
probability of two walkers and can exhibit a crossover to the behavior of a
genuinely one-dimensional random walk. The nature of this transition is also
explained qualitatively.

sigma-definite word representative, defined as a braid word in which the
generator sigma_i with maximal index i appears with exponents that are all
positive, or all negative. This is the ground result for ordering braids. In
this paper, we enhance this result and prove that every braid admits a
sigma-definite word representative that, in addition, is quasi-geodesic. This
establishes a longstanding conjecture. Our proof uses the dual braid monoid and
a new normal form called the rotating normal form.

surface-gravity changes of the Earth. The Earth's inner core is weakly coupled
to the rest part of the Earth by mainly gravitational forces. If there were a
violation of the universality of free-fall, because of their different chemical
compositions and/or of different mass fractions of binding energies, the inner
core and the rest part of the Earth would fall at different rates towards the
Sun and other sources of gravitational fields. The differential acceleration
could be observed as surface-gravity effects. By assuming a simple Earth model,
we discuss the expected surface-gravity effects of violations of the
universality and experiments to search for such effects by using
superconducting gravimeters. It is shown that the universality can be tested to
a level of 10$^{-9}$ using currently operating superconducting gravimeters.
Some improvements can be expected from combinations of global measurements and
applications of advanced data analyses.
