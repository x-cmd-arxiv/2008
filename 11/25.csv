equation of state of dark energy. Measuring a deviation of the
equation-of-state parameter w from -1 would indicate a dark energy that cannot
be represented solely by a cosmological constant. While it is commonly assumed
that any implied modification to the LambdaCDM model amounts to the addition of
new dynamical fields, we propose here a framework for investigating whether or
not such new fields are required when cosmological observations are combined
with a set of minimal assumptions about the nature of gravitational physics. In
our approach, we treat the additional degrees of freedom as perturbatively
constrained and calculate a number of observable quantities, such as the Hubble
expansion rate and the cosmic acceleration, for a homogeneous Universe. We show
that current observations place our Universe within the perturbative validity
of our framework and allow for the presence of non-dynamical gravitational
degrees of freedom at cosmological scales.

expected by orders of magnitude. We present three-dimensional relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations demonstrating amplification and
saturation of magnetic field by a macroscopic turbulent dynamo triggered by the
Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability. We find rapid growth of electromagnetic
energy due to the stretching and folding of field lines in the turbulent
velocity field resulting from non-linear development of the instability. Using
conditions relevant for GRB internal shocks and late phases of GRB afterglow,
we obtain amplification of the electromagnetic energy fraction to $\epsilon_B
\sim 5 \times 10^{-3}$. This value decays slowly after the shear is dissipated
and appears to be largely independent of the initial field strength. The
conditions required for operation of the dynamo are the presence of velocity
shear and some seed magnetization both of which are expected to be commonplace.
We also find that the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum for the case studied
obeys Kolmogorov's 5/3 law and that the electromagnetic energy spectrum is
essentially flat with the bulk of the electromagnetic energy at small scales.

sharp rise up to 100 GeV. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has found a
significant hardening of the e+e- cosmic ray spectrum above 100 GeV, with a
break, confirmed by HESS at around 1 TeV. The Advanced Thin Ionization
Calorimeter (ATIC) has also detected detected a similar excess, falling back to
the expected spectrum at 1 TeV and above. Excess microwaves towards the
galactic center in the WMAP data are consistent with hard synchrotron radiation
from a population of 10-100 GeV e+- (the WMAP ``Haze''). We argue that dark
matter annihilations can provide a consistent explanation of all of these data,
focusing on dominantly leptonic modes, either directly or through a new light
boson. Normalizing the signal to the highest energy evidence (Fermi and HESS),
we find that similar cross sections provide good fits to PAMELA and the Haze,
and that both the required cross section and annihilation modes are achievable
in models with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. These models naturally predict
significant production of gamma rays in the galactic center via a variety of
mechanisms. Most notably, there is a robust inverse-Compton scattered (ICS)
gamma-ray signal arising from the energetic electrons and positrons, detectable
at Fermi/GLAST energies, which should provide smoking gun evidence for this
production.

binary or higher order multiple systems. In this study the influence on the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) of large quantities of unresolved multiple
massive stars is investigated by taking into account stellar evolution and
photometrically determined system masses. The models where initial masses are
derived from the luminosity and colour of unresolved multiple systems show that
even under extreme circumstances (100% binaries or higher order multiples) the
difference between the power-law index of the mass function of all stars and
the observed mass function is small (~0.1). Thus, if the observed IMF has the
Salpeter index alpha = 2.35 then the true stellar IMF has an index not flatter
than alpha = 2.25. Additionally, unresolved multiple systems may hide between
15 and 60% of the underlying true mass of a star cluster. While already a known
result, it is important to point out that the presence of a large number of
unresolved binaries amongst pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars induces a significant
spread in the measured ages of these stars even if there is none. Also,
lower-mass stars in a single-age binary-rich cluster appear older than the
massive stars by about 0.6 Myr.

was simple. We selected events which were good candidates to drive a shock due
to their high speeds (V>1500 km/s). The final list includes 15 CMEs. For each
event, we calibrated the LASCO data, constructed excess mass images and
searched for indications of faint and relatively sharp fronts ahead of the
bright CME front. We found such signatures in 86% (13/15) of the events and
measured the upstream/downstream densities to estimate the shock strength. Our
values are in agreement with theoretical expectations and show good
correlations with the CME kinetic energy and momentum. Finally, we used a
simple forward modeling technique to estimate the 3D shape and orientation of
the white light shock features. We found excellent agreement with the observed

have Z_2 arrow and pseudo-spin representations analogous to those for the
kagome lattice, and use these to construct an exactly solvable quantum dimer
model (QDM) with a Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) ground state. This QDM, first
discussed by Moessner and Sondhi from a different point of view, is the
star-lattice analogue of a kagome-lattice QDM analyzed by Misguich et al. We
give a detailed analysis of various properties of the classical equal-weight
dimer model on the star lattice, most of which are related to those of the RK
state. Using both the arrow representation and the fermionic path integral
formulation of the Pfaffian method, we calculate the number of dimer coverings,
dimer occupation probabilities, and dimer, vison, and monomer correlation
functions. We show that a dimer is uncorrelated with dimers further away than
on neighboring triangles, that the vison-vison correlation function vanishes,
and that the monomer-monomer correlation function equals 1/4 regardless of the
monomer positions (with one exception). A key result in the fermionic approach
is the vanishing of the two-point Green function beyond a short distance. These
properties are very similar to those of dimers on the kagome lattice. We also
discuss some generalizations involving arrow representations for dimer
coverings on ""general Fisher lattices"" and their ""reduced"" lattices, with the
kagome, squagome, and triangular kagome lattice being examples of the latter.

hosts more than 100 young and massive stars. Outside the central cusp (R~1"")
the majority of these O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars reside in a main clockwise
system, plus a second, less prominent disk or streamer system at large angles
with respect to the main system. Here we present the results from new
observations of the Galactic Center with the AO-assisted near-infrared imager
NACO and the integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. These include
the detection of 27 new reliably measured WR/O stars in the central 12"" and
improved measurements of 63 previously detected stars, with proper motion
uncertainties reduced by a factor of four compared to our earlier work. We
develop a detailed statistical analysis of their orbital properties and
orientations. Half of the WR/O stars are compatible with being members of a
clockwise rotating system. The rotation axis of this system shows a strong
transition as a function of the projected distance from SgrA*. The main
clockwise system either is either a strongly warped single disk with a
thickness of about 10 degrees, or consists of a series of streamers with
significant radial variation in their orbital planes. 11 out of 61 clockwise
moving stars have an angular separation of more than 30 degrees from the
clockwise system. The mean eccentricity of the clockwise system is 0.36+/-0.06.
The distribution of the counter-clockwise WR/O star is not isotropic at the 98%
confidence level. It is compatible with a coherent structure such as stellar
filaments, streams, small clusters or possibly a disk in a dissolving state.
The observed disk warp and the steep surface density distribution favor in situ
star formation in gaseous accretion disks as the origin of the young stars.

observations of the edge-on T Tauri star - disk system in the isolated Bok
globule CB26. The aim of these observations was to study the disk-outflow
relation in this 1Myr old low-mass young stellar object. The IRAM PdBI array
was used to observe 12CO(2-1) at 1.3mm in two configurations, resulting in
spectral line maps with 1.5 arcsec resolution. We use an empirical
parameterized steady-state outflow model combined with 2-D line radiative
transfer calculations and chi^2-minimization in parameter space to derive a
best-fit model and constrain parameters of the outflow. The data reveal a
previously undiscovered collimated bipolar molecular outflow of total length
~2000 AU, escaping perpendicular to the plane of the disk. We find peculiar
kinematic signatures that suggest the outflow is rotating with the same
orientation as the disk. However, we could not ultimately exclude jet
precession or two misaligned flows as possible origin of the observed peculiar
velocity field. There is indirect indication that the embedded driving source
is a binary system, which, together with the youth of the source, could provide
the clue to the observed kinematic features of the outflow. CB26 is so far the
most promising source to study the rotation of a molecular outflow. Assuming
that the outflow is rotating, we compute and compare masses, mass flux, angular
momenta, and angular momentum flux of disk and outflow and derive disk
dispersal timescales of 0.5...1 Myr, comparable to the age of the system.

of the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start to
assess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated from
foreground contaminants for a CMBPol mission. At the estimated foreground
minimum of ~100 GHz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than a
primordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.01, in a small
patch (~1%) of the sky known to have low Galactic emission. Over 75% of the sky
we expect the foreground amplitude to exceed the primordial signal by about a
factor of eight at the foreground minimum and on scales of two degrees. Only on
the largest scales does the polarized foreground amplitude exceed the
primordial signal by a larger factor of about 20. The prospects for detecting
an r=0.01 signal including degree-scale measurements appear promising, with 5
sigma_r ~0.003 forecast from multiple methods. A mission that observes a range
of scales offers better prospects from the foregrounds perspective than one
targeting only the lowest few multipoles. We begin to explore how optimizing

ability to perform component separation, with a range of typically 40 < nu <

future CMB polarization experiments. High-sensitivity measurements of

  A fundamental design decision for a future CMB polarization experiment such

large-scale B-mode (and the large-scale E-mode from reionization) is measured,
or high resolution to additionally measure CMB lensing. The purpose of this

satellite mission aiming at detecting a primordial B-mode signal (CMBPol) will
contribute to improving it. We review the observational and analysis techniques
used to constrain the structure of the Galactic magnetic field, whose presence
is responsible for the polarization of Galactic emissions. Although our current
understanding of the magnetized interstellar medium is somewhat limited,
dramatic improvements in our knowledge of its properties are expected by the
time CMBPol flies. Thanks to high resolution and high sensitivity instruments
observing the whole sky at frequencies between 30 GHz and 850 GHz, CMBPol will
not only improve this picture by observing the synchrotron emission from our
galaxy, but also help constrain dust models. Polarized emission from
interstellar dust indeed dominates over any other signal in CMBPol's highest
frequency channels. Observations at these wavelengths, combined with
ground-based studies of starlight polarization, will therefore enable us to
improve our understanding of dust properties and of the mechanism(s)
responsible for the alignment of dust grains with the Galactic magnetic field.
CMBPol will also shed new light on observations that are presently not well
understood. Morphological studies of anomalous dust and synchrotron emissions
will indeed constrain their natures and properties, while searching for
fluctuations in the emission from heliospheric dust will test our understanding
of the circumheliospheric interstellar medium. Finally, acquiring more
information on the properties of extra-Galactic sources will be necessary in
order to maximize the cosmological constraints extracted from CMBPol's
observations of CMB lensing. (abridged)

well known Lense-Thirring precessions of elliptic orbits, is generated by the
spin S of the central body. It deflects and displaces the trajectories
differently according to the mutual orientation of S and the orbital angular
momentum L of the test particle. The gravito-electric force, which induces the
Einstein precession of the perihelion of the orbit of Mercury, always deflects
the trajectories inward irrespective of the L-S orientation. We numerically
compute their effect on the range r, radial and transverse components v_r and

constant = 1, giving the Planck units of mass, length and time, introduces an
artificial contradiction between cosmology and particle physics: the lambda
problem that we associate with Planck constant. We note that the choice of
Planck constant = 1 does not correspond to the scale of quantum physics. For
this scale we prove that the correct value is Planck constant \hbar; 1/10^122,
while the choice of Planck constant = 1 corresponds to the cosmological scale.
This is due to the scale factor of 10^61 that converts the Planck scale to the
cosmological scale. By choosing the ratio G/c^3 = constant = 1, which includes
the choice G = c = 1, and the momentum conservation mc = constant, we preserve
the derivation of the Einstein field equations from the action principle. Then
the product Gm/c^2 = rg, the gravitational radius of m, is constant. For a
quantum black hole we prove that Planck constant \hbar; rg^2 \hbar; (mc)^2. We
also prove that the product lambda x Planck constant is a general constant of
order one, for any scale. The cosmological scale implies lambda \hbar; Planck
constant \hbar; 1, while the Planck scale gives lambda \hbar; 1/Planck constant
\hbar; 10^122. This explains the lambda problem. We get two scales: the
cosmological quantum black hole (QBH), size \Lambda; 10^28 cm, and the quantum
black hole (qbh) that includes the fundamental particles scale, size \Lambda;
10^-13 cm, as well as the Planck scale, size \Lambda; 10^-33 cm.

dominates diffusion; the latter primarily affects small scales and has

regarded as an ideal fluid, i.e., radiative diffusion can be neglected along
with other forms of dissipation. This viewpoint is applied here to an analysis
of simple waves in an ideal radiating fluid. It is shown that much of the
hydrodynamic analysis carries over by simply replacing the material sound
speed, pressure and index with the values appropriate for a radiating fluid. A
complete analysis is performed for a centered rarefaction wave, and expressions
are provided for the Riemann invariants and characteristic curves of the
one-dimensional system of equations. The analytical solution is checked for
consistency against a finite difference numerical integration, and the validity
of neglecting the diffusion operator is demonstrated. An interesting physical
result is that for a material component with a large number of internal degrees
of freedom and an internal energy greater than that of the radiation, the sound
speed increases as the fluid is rarefied. These solutions are an excellent test
for radiation hydrodynamic codes operating in the dynamic diffusion regime. The
general approach may be useful in the development of Godunov numerical schemes

Further increase of the box size has little or no effect on the statistical
properties of the turbulence. An inverse cascade excites magnetic field
structures at the largest scales of the box. The corresponding 10% variation in
the Maxwell stress launches a zonal flow of alternating sub- and

Cloud comets. We discuss the grain properties that change the silicate emission
feature strength (composition, size, and structure/shape), and emphasize that
thermal emission from the comet nucleus can have significant influence on the
derived silicate emission strength. Recent evidence suggests that porosity is
the dominant parameter, although more observations and models of silicates in
Jupiter-family comets are needed to determine if a consistent set of grain
parameters can explain their weak silicate emission features. Models of 8 m
telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope observations have shown that
Jupiter-family comets have crystalline silicates with abundances similar to or
less than those found in Oort Cloud comets, although the crystalline silicate
mineralogy of comets 9P/Tempel and C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) differ from each other
in Mg and Fe content. The heterogeneity of comet nuclei can also be assessed
with mid-infrared spectroscopy, and we review the evidence for heterogeneous
dust properties in the nucleus of comet 9P/Tempel. Models of dust formation,
mixing in the solar nebula, and comet formation must be able to explain the
observed range of Mg and Fe content and the heterogeneity of comet 9P/Tempel,
although more work is needed in order to understand to what extent do comets
9P/Tempel and Hale-Bopp represent comets as a whole.

temperature and characterized by asymmetric and blue-shifted emission lines. We
investigate the origin of these asymmetries and broadening of emission lines.
We perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of the blast wave from the 2006
outburst, propagating through the inhomogeneous CSM. The model takes into
account the thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation)
and the radiative cooling. From the simulations, we synthesize the X-ray
emission and derive the spectra as they would be observed with Chandra/HETG.
Our model reproduces the observed X-ray emission in a natural way if the CSM in
which the outburst occurred is characterized by an equatorial density
enhancement. Our ``best-fit'' model predicts that most of the early X-ray
emission originates from a small region propagating in the direction
perpendicular to the line-of-sight and localized just behind the interaction
front between the blast wave and the equatorial density enhancement. The model
predicts asymmetric and blue-shifted line profiles remarkably similar to those
observed. These asymmetries are due to substantial X-ray absorption of
red-shifted emission by ejecta material. The comparison of high quality data of
Chandra/HETG with detailed hydrodynamic modeling has allowed us to unveil, for
the first time, the details of the structure emitting in the X-ray band in
early phases of the outburst evolution, contributing to a better understanding
of the physics of interactions between nova blasts and CSM in recurrent novae.
This may have implications for whether or not RS Ophiuchi is a Type Ia SN

The basic principles of such networks remain poorly understood. Here we
describe an effective medium theory of flexibly cross-linked stiff polymer
networks. We argue that the response of the cross-links can be fully attributed
to entropic stiffening, while softening due to domain unfolding can be ignored.
The network is modeled as a collection of randomly oriented rods connected by
flexible cross-links to an elastic continuum. This effective medium is treated
in a linear elastic limit as well as in a more general framework, in which the
medium self-consistently represents the nonlinear network behavior. This model
predicts that the nonlinear elastic response sets in at strains proportional to
cross-linker length and inversely proportional to filament length. Furthermore,
we find that the differential modulus scales linearly with the stress in the
stiffening regime. These results are in excellent agreement with bulk rheology
data.

runs in the class RP (i.e., the class of polytime Monte-Carlo algorithms), with
a sampling space exponential in the length of the binary encoding of the input
number. (The class RP contains polytime P.) However, we show how to express the
correctness in the language of V1, and we also show that we can prove the
formula expressing correctness with polytime reasoning from Fermat's Little
theorem, which is generally expected to be independent of V1.
  Our proof is also conceptually very basic in the sense that we use the
extended Euclid's algorithm, for computing greatest common divisors, as the
main workhorse of the proof. For example, we make do without proving the
Chinese Reminder theorem, which is used in the standard proofs.

kpc distant, at least 53 degrees in length, and is most likely the tidal debris
from a dwarf galaxy. As the streams each span multiple constellations, we
extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx
streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a
~1 kpc-wide concentration of stars with a similar color-magnitude distribution
which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location
within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that
Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of
tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints,
preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely
progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.

with higher redshifts relative to the group centre, so-called discordant
redshifts, in particular in groups where the brightest galaxy, identified in
apparent magnitudes, is a spiral. Our aim is to explain the observed redshift
excess. We use a semi-analytical galaxy catalogue constructed from the
Millennium Simulation to study redshift asymmetries in spiral-dominated groups
in the Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology. We show that discordant
redshifts in small galaxy groups arise when these groups are gravitationally
unbound and the dominant galaxy of the group is misidentified. The redshift
excess is especially significant when the apparently brightest galaxy can be
identified as a spiral, in full agreement with observations. On the other hand,
the groups that are gravitationally bound do not show a significant redshift
asymmetry. When the dominant members of groups in mock catalogues are
identified by using the absolute B-band magnitudes, our results show a small
blueshift excess. This result is due to the magnitude limited observations that
miss the faint background galaxies in groups. When the group centre is not
correctly identified it may cause the major part of the observed redshift
excess. If the group is also gravitationally unbound, the level of the redshift
excess becomes as high as in observations. There is no need to introduce any
""anomalous"" redshift mechanism to explain the observed redshift excess.
Further, as the Friends-of-Friends percolation algorithm picks out the
expanding parts of groups, in addition to the gravitationally bound group
cores, group catalogues constructed in this way cannot be used as if the groups
are purely bound systems.

and early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology and
environment with marked correlation functions. These yield clear and precise
environmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similar
measurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the Galaxy Zoo
classifications themselves are very precise. We measure morphology marked
correlation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak,
with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales,
indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. At fixed
morphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong,
and these correlations remain for fixed morphology \textit{and} luminosity. An
implication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due to
the relation between colour and density. Our results also have implications for
galaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usually
accompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. A
spiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagram
without quickly becoming an early-type. We analyze the significant population
of red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located in
moderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirts
of haloes. Finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellite
galaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.

Introducing the new distances, we recompute M_V for 16,086 stars, and U, V, W,

compare them with ages from the Yale-Yonsei and Victoria-Regina models.
Finally, we compare the observed age-velocity relation in W with three

revisions, the basic data for the GCS stars should now be as reliable as is
possible with existing techniques. Further improvement must await consolidation
of the T_eff scale from angular diameters and fluxes, and the Gaia

associated with the Ricci flow equation in MFTs leads to a finite-time Lyapunov
exponential stretching along the toroidal direction of the tube and a

  Permutation graphs","15 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce the 'simultaneous membership problem', defined for
any graph class C characterized in terms of representations, e.g. any class of
intersection graphs. Two graphs G_1 and G_2, sharing some vertices X (and the
corresponding induced edges), are said to be 'simultaneous members' of graph
class C, if there exist representations R_1 and R_2 of G_1 and G_2 that are
""consistent"" on X. Equivalently (for the classes C that we consider) there
exist edges E' between G_1-X and G_2-X such that G_1 \cup G_2 \cup E' belongs
to class C.
  Simultaneous membership problems have application in any situation where it
is desirable to consistently represent two related graphs, for example:
interval graphs capturing overlaps of DNA fragments of two similar organisms;
or graphs connected in time, where one is an updated version of the other.
Simultaneous membership problems are related to simultaneous planar embeddings,
graph sandwich problems and probe graph recognition problems.
  In this paper we give efficient algorithms for the simultaneous membership
problem on chordal, comparability and permutation graphs. These results imply
that graph sandwich problems for the above classes are tractable for an
interesting special case: when the set of optional edges form a complete
bipartite graph. Our results complement the recent polynomial time recognition
algorithms for probe chordal, comparability, and permutation graphs, where the
set of optional edges form a clique.

polarizations generated by relic gravitational waves (RGWs). As a substantial
extension to the previous studies, three new ingredients are included in this
work. Firstly, the analytic $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ are given; especially the
latter can be useful to extract signal of RGWs from the observed data in the
zero multipole method. Secondly, a fitting formula of the decaying factor on
small scales is given, coming from the visibility function around the photon
decoupling. Thirdly, the impacts by the neutrino free-streaming (NFS) is
examined, a process that occurred in the early universe and leaves observable
imprints on CMB via RGWs.
  It is found that the analytic $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ have profiles
agreeing with the numeric ones, except that $C^{TT}_l$ in a range $l \le 10$
and the $1^{st}$ trough of $C_l^{TE}$ around $l \sim 75$ have some deviations.
With the new damping factor, the analytic $C^{EE}_l$ and $C^{BB}_l$ match with
the numeric ones with the maximum errors only $\sim 3%$ up to the first three
peaks for $l\le 600$, improving the previous studies substantially. The
correspondence of the positions of peaks of $C^{XX}_l$ and those of RGWs are
also demonstrated explicitly. We also find that NFS reduces the amplitudes of
$C^{XX}_l$ by $(20% \sim 35%)$ for $l\simeq(100\sim 600)$ and shifts slightly
their peaks to smaller angles. Detailed analyses show that the zero multipoles
$l_0$, where $C_l^{TE}$ crosses 0, are shifted to larger values by NFS. This
shifting effect is as important as those causedby different inflation models
and different baryon fractions.

server, which has the information of all the download bandwidths and upload
bandwidths of the peers, minimizes the weighted average download time by
determining the optimal transmission rate from the server to the peers and from
the peers to the other peers. This paper first defines the static P2P network,
the hierarchical P2P network and the strictly hierarchical P2P network. Any
static P2P network can be decomposed into an equivalent network of sub-peers
that is strictly hierarchical. This paper shows that convex optimization can
minimize the WADT for P2P networks by equivalently minimizing the WADT for
strictly hierarchical networks of sub-peers. This paper then gives an upper
bound for minimizing WADT by constructing a hierarchical P2P network, and lower
bound by weakening the constraints of the convex problem. Both the upper bound
and the lower bound are very tight. This paper also provides several suboptimal
solutions for minimizing the WADT for strictly hierarchical networks, in which
peer selection algorithms and chunk selection algorithm can be locally
designed.

two codimension one parallel branes located on $(D+1)$-dimensional background
spacetime $AdS_{D_{1}+1}\times \Sigma $ with a warped internal space $\Sigma $.
The general case of different Robin coefficients on separate branes is
considered. Unlike to the purely AdS bulk, the vacuum expectation values
induced by a single brane, in addition to the distance from the brane, depends
also on the position of the brane in the bulk. The brane induced parts in these
expectation values vanish when the brane position tends to the AdS horizon or
AdS boundary. For strong gravitational fields corresponding to large values of
the AdS energy scale, the both single brane and interference parts of the
expectation values integrated over the internal space are exponentially
suppressed. An application to the higher dimensional generalization of the
Randall-Sundrum brane model with arbitrary mass terms on the branes is
discussed. For large distances between the branes the induced surface densities
give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological constant on the brane.

observable counterpart of this radius for stars of different magnitude ranges
is used as the effective radius of each stellar species in a star cluster. We
explore the dependence of these radii on magnitude as a possible indication of
stellar stratification. This method is the first of its kind to use a
dynamically stable radius, and though seemingly trivial it has never been
applied before. We test the proposed method using model star clusters, which
are constructed to be segregated on the basis of a Monte Carlo technique, and
on Hubble Space Telescope observations of mass-segregated star clusters in
order to explore the limitations of the method in relation to actual data. We
conclude that the method performs efficiently in the detection of stellar
stratification and its results do not depend on the data, provided that
incompleteness has been accurately measured and the contamination by the field
population has been thoroughly removed. Our diagnosis method is also
independent of any model or theoretical prediction, in contrast to the
`classical' methods used so far for the detection of mass segregation.

and is central in diverse human pathologies. Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine
protease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby
enabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of
fibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces
endothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the
Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological
inhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how
permeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the
mechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that
thrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins G(12/13) and G(11/q)
to induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these
events are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which
causes actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to
account for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein
kinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent S/T kinase, is activated in
endothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required
for endothelial permeability and remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and
cell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by
thrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal
architecture through ROCK and the remodeling of focal adhesion components
through PRK. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction
disruption and provoke vascular leakage.

of luminosities and stellar mass of early-type galaxies on the different models
and model parameters which can be used to analyze the observational data. The
paper is organized in two parts. The first one analyzes the dependence of the
M/L ratios and of the k-corrections in different bands on model parameters
(IMF, metallicity, star formation history, age), assuming some among the most
popular spectrophotometric codes usually adopted to study the evolutionary
status of galaxies [...]. The second part of our work is dedicated to quantify
the reliability and systematics affecting the mass and luminosity estimates
obtained by means of the best fitting technique applied to the photometric SEDs
of early-type galaxies at $1<z<2$. To this end, we apply the best fitting
technique to some mock catalogs built on the basis of a wide set of models of
early-type galaxies. We then compare the luminosity and the stellar mass
estimated from the SED fitting with the true known input values. The goodness
of the mass estimate is found to be dependent on the mass estimator adopted to
derive it, but masses cannot anyhow be retrieved better than within a factor
2-3, depending on the quality of the available photometric data and/or on the
distance of the galaxies since more distant galaxies are fainter on average and
thus affected by larger photometric errors. Finally, we present a new empirical
mass estimator based on the K band apparent magnitude and on the observed (V-K)
colour. We show that the reliability of the stellar mass content derived with
this new estimator for early-type galaxies and its stability are even higher
than those achievable with the best classic estimators, with the not negligible
advantage that it does not need any multi-wavelength data fitting.

in time under the influence of a static magnetic field and a laser pulse. We
find that demagnetization and switching can be best achieved in a subpicosecond
regime with linearly rather than circularly polarized light. We also show the
importance of including an external magnetic field in order to distinguish
spin-up and spin-down states and the necessity of including magnetic-dipole
transitions in order to realize the $\Lambda$-process in the centrosymmetric
bulk. Having already shown the effects of phonons in the SHG for the bulk NiO

Her binary system. ~35 day modulations are observed 1) in the Turn-On cycles
with two on- and two off-states, and 2) in the changing shape of the pulse
profiles which re-appears regularly. The two ways of counting the 35 day cycles
are generally in synchronization. This synchronization did apparently break
down temporarily during the long Anomalous Low (AL3) which Her X-1 experienced
in 1999/2000, in the sense that there must have been one extra Turn-On cycle.
Our working hypothesis is that there are two clocks in the system, both with a
period of about ~35 days: precession of the accretion disk (the less stable
""Turn-On clock"") and free precession of the neutron star (the more stable
""Pulse profile clock""). We suggest that free precession of the neutron star is
the master clock, and that the precession of the accretion disk is basically
synchronized to that of the neutron star through a feed-back mechanism in the
binary system. However, the Turn-On clock can slip against its master when the
accretion disk has a very low inclination, as is observed to be the case during
AL3. We take the apparent correlation between the histories of the Turn-Ons, of
the Anomalous Lows and of the pulse period evolution, with a 5 yr
quasi-periodicity, as evidence for strong physical interaction and feed-back
between the major components in the system. We speculate that the 5 yr (10 yr)
period is either due to a corresponding activity cycle of HZ Her or a natural
ringing period of the physical system of coupled components. The question
whether free precession really exists in neutron stars is of great importance
for the understanding of matter with supra-nuclear density.

the penetration depth anisotropy differently than the upper critical field
anisotropy, provides evidence that in the oxypnictide superconductors two
distinct anisotropies are present. As a result the penetration depth anisotropy
differs significantly in magnitude and in temperature dependence from the upper
critical field anisotropy, analogous to MgB_2 but with a reversed sign of

Anderson to be the reference state from which the transition to BCS

to the scarcity of model materials. Theoretical work has put forward the S =

micron images of 14 well-known massive star formation regions with
Subaru/COMICS. The images reveal the presence of discrete MYSO sources which
are resolved on arcsecond scales. For many sources, radiative transfer models
are capable of satisfactorily reproducing the observations. They are described
by density powerlaw distributions (n(r) ~ r^(-p)) with p = 1.0 +/-0.25. Such
distributions are shallower than those found on larger scales probed with
single-dish (sub)mm studies. Other sources have density laws that are
shallower/steeper than p = 1.0 and there is evidence that these MYSOs are
viewed near edge-on or near face-on, respectively. The images also reveal a
diffuse component tracing somewhat larger scale structures, particularly
visible in the regions S140, AFGL 2136, IRAS 20126+4104, Mon R2, and Cep A. We
thus find a flattening of the MYSO envelope density law going from ~10 000 AU

first briefly summarise the main results of the full theoretical description we
have given elsewhere, presenting them in a more physical way, aimed to an
understanding without the requirement of extended knowledge of dynamical
systems or of orbital structure. We introduce in this manner the notion of
manifolds, which can be thought of as tubes guiding the orbits. The dynamics of
these manifolds can govern the properties of spirals and of inner and outer
rings in barred galaxies. We find that the bar strength affects how unstable
the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points are, the motion within the 5A5A5Amanifold tubes
and the time necessary for particles in a manifold to make a complete turn
around the galactic centre. We also show that the strength of the bar, or, to
be more precise, of the non-axisymmetric forcing at and somewhat beyond the
corotation region, determines the resulting morphology. Thus, less strong bars
give rise to R1 rings or pseudorings, while stronger bars drive R2, R1R2 and
spiral morphologies. We examine the morphology as a function of the main
parameters of the bar and present descriptive two dimensional plots to that
avail. We also derive how the manifold morphologies and properties are modified
if the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points become stable. Finally, we discuss how
dissipation affects the manifold properties and compare the manifolds in
gas-like and in stellar cases. Comparison with observations, as well as clear
predictions to be tested by observations will be given in an accompanying
paper.

inside a compact binary system. Depending on the parameters of NS and the wind,
the matter can penetrate the inner NS magnetosphere. At some distance from the
NS a very turbulent and magnetized transition region is formed due to the
balance between the magnetic pressure and the pressure inserted by accreting
matter. This region provides good conditions for acceleration of particles to
relativistic energies. The matter at the transition region can farther accrete
onto the NS surface (the accretor phase) or is expelled from the NS vicinity
(the propeller phase). We consider the consequences of acceleration of
electrons at the transition region concentrating on the situation in which at
least part of the matter falls onto the NS surface. This matter creates a hot
spot on the NS surface which emits thermal radiation. Relativistic electrons
lose energy on the synchrotron process and the inverse Compton (IC) scattering
of this thermal radiation. We calculate the synchrotron spectra (from X-rays to
soft $\gamma$-rays) and IC spectra (above a few tens MeV) expected in such a
scenario. It is argued that a population of recently discovered massive
binaries by the INTEGRAL observatory, which contain neutron stars hidden inside
dense stellar winds of massive stars, can be detectable by the recently
launched {\it Fermi} LAT telescope at GeV energy range. As an example, we
predict the expected $\gamma$-ray flux from recently discovered source IGR

The map $J$ is injective, and the image $J(\mathcal M_g)$ is contained in a

long-studied Schottky problem is to characterize the Jacobian locus $\mathcal

version of this problem posed by Farb and called the {\em coarse Schottky
problem}: How does $\mathcal J_g$ look ""from far away"", or how ""dense"" is
$\mathcal J_g$ in the sense of coarse geometry? The coarse geometry of the
Siegel modular variety $\mathcal A_g$ is encoded in its asymptotic cone

precisely, the subset of $\textup{Cone}_\infty(\mathcal A_g)$ determinded by
$\mathcal J_g$ actually coincides with this cone. The proof also shows that the
Jacobian locus of hyperelliptic curves is coarsely dense in $\mathcal A_g$ as

$\mathcal A_g$ and in the Baily-Borel and the Borel-Serre compactification. We
show that for large genus $g$ the set of boundary points of $\mathcal J_g$ in

unremarkable or no emission lines (thus are likely Compton thick AGNs); 5 are

zero-energy resonances where the trimer dissociates into three free atoms. Our

S
is a local maximum stable set of G, if S is a maximum stable set of the
subgraph induced by its closed neighborhood.
  Nemhauser and Trotter Jr. proved in 1975 that any local maximum stable set is
a subset of a maximum stable set of G. In 2002 we showed that the family of all
local maximum stable sets of a forest forms a greedoid on its vertex set. The
cases where G is bipartite, triangle-free, well-covered, while the family of
all local maximum stable sets is a greedoid, were analyzed in 2004, 2007, and
2008, respectively.
  In this paper we demonstrate that if the family of all local maximum stable
sets of the graph satisfies the accessibility property, then it is an interval
greedoid. We also characterize those graphs whose families of local maximum
stable sets are either antimatroids or matroids.

then under some mild additional assumptions (relaxing requirements on the
relation between w and \ell which appear in previous works) the existence of a
\tilde{\pi} congruent to \pi mod \lambda such that \tilde{\pi}_w has more
parahoric fixed vectors than \pi_w, is proven. In the case where G_w has
semisimple rank one, results of Clozel, Bellaiche and Graftieaux according to

main theorem two examples over F of rank greater than one are considered. In

distribution (SED) as well as the ammonia line emission of the G31.41+0.31 hot
core. The core is modeled as an infalling envelope onto a massive star that is
undergoing an intense accretion phase. We assume an envelope with a density and
velocity structure resulting from the dynamical collapse of a singular
logatropic sphere. The stellar and envelope physical properties are determined
by fitting the SED. From these physical conditions, the ammonia line emission
is calculated and compared with subarcsecond resolution VLA data of the (4,4)
transition. The only free parameter in this line fitting is the ammonia
abundance. The observed properties of the NH3(4,4) lines and their spatial
distribution can be well reproduced provided it is taken into account the steep
increase of the abundance in the hotter (> 100 K), inner regions of the core
produced by the sublimation of icy mantles where ammonia molecules are trapped.
The model predictions for the (2,2), (4,4), and (5,5) transitions are also in
reasonably agreement with the single-dish spectra available in the literature.
The best fit is obtained for a model with a star of 25 Msun, a mass accretion
rate of 0.003 Msun/yr, and a total luminosity of 200,000 Lsun. The gas-phase
ammonia abundance ranges from 2 \times 10^{-8} in the outer region to 3 \times
10^{-6} in the inner region. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
dust and molecular line data of a hot molecular core, including subarcsecond
resolution data that spatially resolve the structure of the core, have been
simultaneously explained by a physically self-consistent model. This modeling
shows that massive protostars are able to excite high excitation ammonia
transitions up to the outer edge (30,000 AU) of the large scale envelope.

is more robust, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is preserved.

reexpressed in terms of an appropriate conformal metric that is regular at
(future) null infinity, they develop apparently singular terms in the
associated conformal factor and thus appear to be ill-behaved at this
(exterior) boundary. In this article however we show, through an enforcement of
the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints to the needed order in a Taylor
expansion, that these apparently singular terms are not only regular at the
boundary but can in fact be explicitly evaluated there in terms of conformally
regular geometric data. Though we employ a rather rigidly constrained and gauge
fixed formulation of the field equations, we discuss the extent to which we
expect our results to have a more 'universal' significance and, in particular,
to be applicable, after minor modifications, to alternative formulations.

This data has been analyzed to search for extraterrestrial point sources of
neutrinos using several methods. Two main methods are discussed and compared
here: the binned and the unbinned maximum likelihood method. The best
sky-averaged sensitivity (90% C.L.) is E^2 Phi_nu_mu=1.3 10^-11 TeVcm^-2s^-1 to
a generic E^-2 flux of nu_mu over the energy range from 3 TeV to 3 PeV. No
neutrino point sources are found from the individual directions of a
pre-selected catalogue nor in a search extended to the northern sky. Limits are
improved by a factor of two compared to the total statistics collected with the
AMANDA-II detector and represent the best results to date.

proposal that the itinerant electrons and local moments are simultaneously
present in such multiband materials. We study a minimal model composed of
coupled itinerant electrons and local moments to illustrate how a consistent
explanation of the experimental measurements can be obtained in the leading
order approximation. In this mean-field approach, the spin-density-wave (SDW)
order and superconducting pairing of the itinerant electrons are not directly
driven by the Fermi surface nesting, but are mainly induced by their coupling
to the local moments. The presence of the local moments as independent degrees
of freedom naturally provides strong pairing strength for superconductivity and
also explains the normal-state linear-temperature magnetic susceptibility above
the SDW transition temperature. We show that this simple model is supported by
various anomalous magnetic properties and isotope effect which are in
quantitative agreement with experiments.

including rotation are largely unsuccessful in explaining the CNO properties of
stars in the Galaxy and in the Magellanic clouds.
