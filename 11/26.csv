single field, the inflaton, generate approximately Gaussian primordial density
perturbations. At present, the bispectrum and trispectrum of the density
perturbations have not been observed and the probability distribution for these
perturbations is consistent with Gaussianity. However, Planck satellite data
will bring a new level of precision to bear on this issue, and it is possible
that evidence for non-Gaussian effects in the primordial distribution will be
discovered. One possibility is that a trispectrum will be observed without
evidence for a non-zero bispectrum. It is not difficult for this to occur in
inflationary models where quantum fluctuations in a field other than the
inflaton contribute to the density perturbations. A natural question to ask is
whether such an observation would rule out the standard scenarios. We explore
this issue and find that it is possible to construct single-field models in
which inflaton-generated primordial density perturbations have an observable
trispectrum, but a bispectrum that is too small to be observed by the Planck
satellite. However, an awkward fine tuning seems to be unavoidable.

undergo a transition from a compressible phase with strong intralayer
correlation to an incompressible phase with strong interlayer correlations as
the layer separation d is reduced below some critical value. Deep in the
intralayer phase (large separation) the system can be interpreted as a fluid of
composite fermions (CFs), whereas deep in the interlayer phase (small
separation) the system can be interpreted as a fluid of composite bosons (CBs).
The focus of this paper is to understand the states that occur for intermediate
layer separation by using trial variational wavefunctions. We consider two main
classes of wavefunctions. In the first class, previously introduced by Moller
et al. [PRL {\bf 101}, 176803 (2008)], we consider interlayer BCS pairing of
two independent CF liquids. We find that these wavefunctions are exceedingly
good for d >~ \ell_0 with \ell_0 the magnetic length. The second class of
wavefunctions naturally follows the reasoning of Simon et al. [PRL {\bf 91},
046803 (2003)] and generalizes the idea of pairing wavefunctions by allowing
the CFs also to be replaced continuously by CBs. This generalization allows us
to construct exceedingly good wavefunctions for interlayer spacings of d <~
\ell_0, as well. The accuracy of the wavefunctions discussed in this work,
compared with exact diagonalization, approaches that of the celebrated Laughlin
wavefunction.

general relativity are plagued by difficulties. General relativistic models are
mostly based on a dark energy field with fine-tuned, unnatural properties.
There is a great variety of models, but all share one feature in common -- an
inability to account for the gravitational properties of the vacuum energy, and
a failure to solve the so-called coincidence problem. Two broad alternatives to
dark energy have emerged as candidate models: these typically address only the
coincidence problem and not the vacuum energy problem. The first is based on
general relativity and attempts to describe the acceleration as an effect of
inhomogeneity in the universe. If this alternative could be shown to work, then
it would provide a dramatic resolution of the coincidence problem; however, a
convincing demonstration of viability has not yet emerged. The second
alternative is based on infra-red modifications to general relativity, leading
to a weakening of gravity on the largest scales and thus to acceleration. Most
examples investigated so far are scalar-tensor or brane-world models, and we
focus on the simplest candidates of each type: $f(R)$ models and DGP models
respectively. Both of these provide a new angle on the problem, but they also
face serious difficulties. However, investigation of these models does lead to
valuable insights into the properties of gravity and structure formation, and
it also leads to new strategies for testing the validity of General Relativity
itself on cosmological scales.

found at RHIC are understood as the consequence of perturbative QCD (pQCD)
interactions within the 3+1 dimensional parton cascade BAMPS. The main
contributions stem from pQCD bremsstrahlung $2 \leftrightarrow 3 $ processes.
By comparing to Au+Au data of the flow parameter $v_2$ as a function of
participation number the shear viscosity to entropy ratio is dynamically
extracted, which lies in the range of 0.08 and 0.2, depending on the chosen
coupling constant and freeze out condition. Furthermore, first simulations on
the temporal propagation of dissipative shock waves are given. The cascade can
either simulate true ideal shocks as well as initially diluted, truely viscous
shocks, depending on the employed cross sections or mean free path,
respectively.

using only GALEX and optical r-band photometry, using the method given by Atlee

the same catalog by Richards et al. shows that the completeness of the sample

the broad band (keV-GeV) power peak. We show that this thermal component
exhibits a characteristic temporal behavior. We study a sample of 56 long

after which it decays as a power law with a sample-averaged index of -0.68. The
thermal flux first rises with an averaged power-law index of 0.63 after which
it decays with an averaged index of -2. The break times are the same to within

by a careful ``folding'' of the Reed-Solomon code. The ``low-degree'' nature of
this folding operation was crucial to the list decoding algorithm. We show how
such folding schemes conducive to list decoding arise out of the
Artin-Frobenius automorphism at primes in Galois extensions. Using this
approach, we construct new folded algebraic-geometric codes for list decoding
based on cyclotomic function fields with a cyclic Galois group. Such function
fields are obtained by adjoining torsion points of the Carlitz action of an
irreducible $M \in \F_q[T]$. The Reed-Solomon case corresponds to the simplest
such extension (corresponding to the case $M=T$). In the general case, we need
to descend to the fixed field of a suitable Galois subgroup in order to ensure
the existence of many degree one places that can be used for encoding.
  Our methods shed new light on algebraic codes and their list decoding, and
lead to new codes achieving list decoding capacity. Quantitatively, these codes
provide list decoding (and list recovery/soft decoding) guarantees similar to
folded Reed-Solomon codes but with an alphabet size that is only
polylogarithmic in the block length. In comparison, for folded RS codes, the
alphabet size is a large polynomial in the block length. This has applications
to fully explicit (with no brute-force search) binary concatenated codes for
list decoding up to the Zyablov radius.

method exploits the natural eigenfunctions of the master equation of
birth-death processes to solve for the joint distribution of modules within the
network, which then inform each other and facilitate calculation of the entire
joint distribution. We illustrate the method on a ubiquitous case in nature:
linear regulatory cascades. The efficiency of the method makes possible
numerical optimization of the input and regulatory parameters, revealing design
properties of, e.g., the most informative cascades. We find, for threshold
regulation, that a cascade of strong regulations converts a unimodal input to a
bimodal output, that multimodal inputs are no more informative than bimodal
inputs, and that a chain of up-regulations outperforms a chain of
down-regulations. We anticipate that this numerical approach may be useful for

observed in H1504+65, the most massive known PG1159 star. We concentrate mainly
on the possibility that this star could be the result of mass loss shortly
after the born-again and during the subsequent evolution through the [WCL]
stage. This possibility is sustained by recent observational evidence of
extensive mass-loss events in Sakurai's object and is in line with the recent
finding that such mass losses give rise to PG1159 models with thin helium-rich
envelopes and large rates of period change, as demanded by the pulsating star
PG1159-035. We compute the post born again evolution of massive sequences by
taking into account different mass-loss rate histories. Our results show that
stationary winds during the post-born-again evolution fail to remove completely
the helium-rich envelope so as to explain the helium deficiency observed in
H1504+65. Stationary winds during the Sakurai and [WCL] stages only remove at
most half of the envelope surviving the violent hydrogen burning during the
born-again phase. In view of our results, the recently suggested evolutionary
connection born-again stars --> H1504+65 --> white dwarfs with carbon-rich
atmospheres is difficult to sustain unless the whole helium-rich envelope could
be ejected by non-stationary mass-loss episodes during the Sakurai stage.

from 3.6 to 24 micron, provided by the Spitzer, ISO and AKARI satellites. The
infrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy Spectral Energy
Distributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. For ~90%
of the sources in our sample the redshift is recovered with an accuracy
|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)<~10%. A similar analysis performed on different sets
of simulated spectra shows that the AKARI infrared data alone can provide
photometric redshifts accurate to |z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)<~10% (1-sigma) at
z<~2. At higher redshifts the PAH features are shifted outside the wavelength
range covered by AKARI and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6
micron stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1+z) is ~10-15%,
provided that the AGN contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. Our
technique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-uv photo-z, and it

As examples, for the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) this single-letter

single-letter function is Galois-Field-two addition. This paper identifies
several classes of discrete memoryless DBCs for which a relatively simple
encoding scheme, which we call natural encoding, achieves capacity. Natural
Encoding (NE) combines symbols from independent codebooks (one for each
receiver) using the same single-letter function that adds distortion to the
channel. The alphabet size of each NE codebook is bounded by that of the

  Inspired by Witsenhausen and Wyner, this paper defines the conditional

that NE achieves the boundary of the capacity region for the multi-receiver
broadcast Z channel. Then, this paper defines the input-symmetric DBC,
introduces permutation encoding for the input-symmetric DBC, and proves its
optimality. Because it is a special case of permutation encoding, NE is
capacity achieving for the two-receiver group-operation DBC. Combining the
broadcast Z channel and group-operation DBC results yields a proof that NE is
also optimal for the discrete multiplication DBC. Along the way, the paper also
provides explicit parametric expressions for the two-receiver binary-symmetric

coding. For subspace codes and CDCs, a subspace metric was introduced to
correct both errors and erasures, and an injection metric was proposed to
correct adversarial errors. In this paper, we investigate the packing and
covering properties of subspace codes with both metrics. We first determine
some fundamental geometric properties of the projective space with both
metrics. Using these properties, we then derive bounds on the cardinalities of
packing and covering subspace codes, and determine the asymptotic rates of
optimal packing and optimal covering subspace codes with both metrics. Our
results not only provide guiding principles for the code design for error
control in random linear network coding, but also illustrate the difference
between the two metrics from a geometric perspective. In particular, our
results show that optimal packing CDCs are optimal packing subspace codes up to
a scalar for both metrics if and only if their dimension is half of their
length (up to rounding). In this case, CDCs suffer from only limited rate loss
as opposed to subspace codes with the same minimum distance. We also show that
optimal covering CDCs can be used to construct asymptotically optimal covering
subspace codes with the injection metric only.

an unique pattern in time and energy of solar axion conversions is expected.

disk forms as massive satellites are preferentially dragged into the disk-plane
where they dissolve. Here, we quantify the importance of this dark disk for
direct and indirect dark matter detection. The low velocity of the dark disk
with respect to the Earth enhances detection rates in direct detection
experiments at low recoil energy. For WIMP masses M_{WIMP} >~ 50 GeV, the
detection rate increases by up to a factor of 3 in the 5 - 20 keV recoil energy
range. Comparing this with rates at higher energy is sensitive to M_{WIMP},
providing stronger mass constraints particularly for M_{WIMP}>~100 GeV. The
annual modulation signal is significantly boosted by the dark disk and the
modulation phase is shifted by ~3 weeks relative to the dark halo. The
variation of the observed phase with recoil energy determines M_{WIMP}, once
the dark disk properties are fixed by future astronomical surveys. The low
velocity of the particles in the dark disk with respect to the solar system
significantly enhances the capture rate of WIMPs in the Sun, leading to an
increased flux of neutrinos from the Sun which could be detected in current and
future neutrino telescopes. The dark disk contribution to the muon flux from
neutrino back conversion at the Earth is increased by a factor of ~5 compared
to the SHM, for rho_d/rho_h=0.5.

to observed anomalies in microlensing light curves, such as the mass and
separation of extra-solar planets orbiting the lens star, or the relative
source-lens parallax, are already anchored in factors that limit the amount of
information available from ordinary events and in the adopted parametrization.
Moreover, a real-time detection of deviations from an ordinary light curve
while these are still in progress can only be done against a known model of the
latter, and such is also required for properly prioritizing ongoing events for
monitoring in order to maximize scientific returns. Despite the fact that
ordinary microlensing light curves are described by an analytic function that
only involves a handful of parameters, modelling these is far less trivial than
one might be tempted to think. A well-known degeneracy for small impacts, and
another one for the initial rise of an event, makes an interprediction of
different phases impossible, while determining a complete set of model
parameters requires the assessment of the fundamental characteristics of all
these phases. While the wing of the light curve provides valuable information
about the time-scale that absorbs the physical properties, the peak flux of the
event can be meaningfully predicted only after about a third of the total
magnification has been reached. Parametrizations based on observable features
not only ease modelling by bringing the covariance matrix close to diagonal
form, but also allow good predictions of the measured flux without the need to
determine all parameters accurately. Campaigns intending to infer planet
populations from observed microlensing events need to invest some time into
acquiring data that allows to properly determine the magnification function.

anti-de Sitter space, electrical transport properties, such as conductivity and
charge diffusion, are determined by the dynamics of a U(1) gauge field in the
bulk and thus obey universality relations at the classical level due to the
uniqueness of the Maxwell action. We analyze corrections to these transport
parameters due to higher-dimension operators in the bulk action, beyond the
leading Maxwell term, of which the most significant involves a coupling to the
bulk Weyl tensor. We show that the ensuing corrections to conductivity and the
diffusion constant break the universal relation with the U(1) central charge
observed at leading order, but are nonetheless subject to interesting bounds
associated with causality in the boundary CFT.

and their lower moments are investigated within the framework of the chiral
quark soliton model (CQSM), with particular emphasis upon the transversity
decomposition of nucleon angular momentum proposed by Burkardt. A strong
correlation between quark spin and orbital angular momentum inside the nucleon
is manifest itself in the derived second moment sum rule within the CQSM,
thereby providing with an additional support to the qualitative connection
between chiral-odd GPDs and the Boer-Mulders effects. We further confirm
isoscalar dominance of the corresponding first moment sum rule, which indicates
that the Boer-Mulders functions for the $u$- and $d$-quarks have roughly equal
magnitude with the same sign. Also made are some comments on the recent
empirical extraction of the tensor charges of the nucleon by Anselmino et al.
We demonstrate that a comparison of their result with any theoretical
predictions must be done with great care, in consideration of fairly strong
scale dependence of tensor charges, especially at lower renormalization scale.

  We show that in general the answer is that the number of measurements

polyhedra fewer measurements suffice; in the case of the unit cube we show that
nine carefully chosen measurements are enough.
  We also prove a number of analogous results for planar polygons. In

all rectangles, that can be determined up to congruence with only four

sensitive and that tree-level unitarity is violated when scattering energies
are of order a TeV and the noncommutative scale is below about a TeV. We find
that WW production at the LHC is not sensitive to scales above the unitarity
bounds. WW production in e+e- annihilation, however, provides a good probe of
such effects with noncommutative scales below 300-400 GeV being excluded at
LEP-II, and the ILC being sensitive to scales up to 10-20 TeV. In addition, we
find that the ability to measure the helicity states of the final state W
bosons at the ILC provides a diagnostic tool to determine and disentangle the
different possible noncommutative contributions.

Indeed progress in the study of large scale structures and galaxy formation
would have been very limited without this tool. For nearly twenty years the
limitations imposed by computing power forced simulators to ignore some of the
basic requirements for modeling gravitational instability. One of the
limitations of most cosmological codes has been the use of a force softening
length that is much smaller than the typical inter-particle separation. This
leads to departures from collisionless evolution that is desired in these
simulations. We propose a particle based method with an adaptive resolution
where the force softening length is reduced in high density regions while
ensuring that it remains well above the local inter-particle separation. The
method, called the Adaptive TreePM, is based on the TreePM code. We present the
mathematical model and an implementation of this code, and demonstrate that the
results converge over a range of options for parameters introduced in
generalizing the code from the TreePM code. We explicitly demonstrate
collisionless evolution in collapse of an oblique plane wave. We compare the
code with the fixed resolution TreePM code and also an implementation that
mimics adaptive mesh refinement methods and comment on the agreement, and
disagreements in the results. We find that in most respects the ATreePM code
performs at least as well as the fixed resolution TreePM in highly over-dense
regions, from clustering and number density of haloes, to internal dynamics of
haloes. We also show that the adaptive code is faster than the corresponding
high resolution TreePM code.

type and colors. For the effective temperature versus $(V-K)_0$ color, we find
an empirical calibration with a median deviation of $\Delta T = 70$K in the
range of $0.7 < (V-K)_0 < 5.1$ for LC I stars; for LC II, the median deviation
is $\Delta T = 120$K from $0.4 < (V-K)_0 < 4.3$. Effective temperature as a
function of spectral type is also calibrated from these data, but shows
significantly more scatter than the $T_{\rm EFF}$ versus $(V-K)_0$
relationship. No deviation of $T_{\rm EFF}$ versus spectral type is seen for
these high luminosity objects relative to luminosity class II giants. Directly
determined diameters range up to $400 R_\odot$, though are limited by poor
distance determinations, which dominate the error estimates. These temperature
and radii measures reflect a direct calibration of these parameters for
supergiants from empirical means.

disorder-induced magnetization at low temperatures. In addition, we give a
possible explanation of the anomalous bimodal line shape observed at high

between chains and CuO plane induces anisotropic magnetization on the planar
Cu, and broadens the plane NMR lines in accordance with that of the chain

the low-energy response, the redistribution in spectra of absorbed sources, and
the modelling of the line profile have been significantly improved since launch
by introducing empirical corrections in our code when it was not possible to

in June 2006 (i.e. 14 months after launch), but the evidence of a more serious
degradation in spectroscopic performance (line broadening and change in the
low-energy response) due to large charge traps (i.e. faults in the Si crystal)

sections, between their cells) are considered; in a cell, there are bending
magnets of two kinds, of unequal magnetic field. Minimization of the effective
emittance is carried out by the following algorithm (which follows Teng, and
partly Lee).
  (1) Every inner dipole's contribution to the natural emittance is minimized
with respect to all optics parameters (relating to dispersion and
beta-function), except for the shift parameter, s_0, which specifies the
interval between the beta-function minimum and the center of a magnet; for a
side bending magnet, its contribution to an integral relating to the effective
emittance (the relation uses the fact that the arithmetic mean majorizes the
geometric mean) is minimized.
  (2) The other parameters of dipoles (fields, lengths or angles ratios,
shifts) are restricted with the boundary conditions: the equality of
Courant-Snyder invariants on the exit from a magnet and on the entrance to the
following one. (3) The minimum of effective emittance and the last free
parameters (two or three) can be found by computation.
  The accuracy of this method falls with decreasing of the number of internal
dipoles in a cell, and still the isomagnetic Tanaka-Ando minimum (for the
modified DBA*-lattice which has no inner dipoles) is reproduced with accuracy
better than half a percent. If the number of dipoles per cell does not exceed
four, the smallest effective emittance (14% lower than TA-limit) is achieved
for QBA**-lattice where all dipoles have nonzero shifts.

corresponds to the stylized facts. The mechanism to enter or leave the market
is based on the idea that a too stable market is unappealing for traders while
the presence of price movements attracts agents to enter and speculate on the
market. We show that this mechanism is also compatible with the idea that
agents are scared by a noisy and risky market at shorter time scales. We also
show that the mechanism for self-organization is robust with respect to
variations of the exit/entry rules and that the attempt to trigger the system
to self-organize in a region without stylized facts leads to an unrealistic

width (EW) of the H-alpha emission line in X-ray binary systems. The effect is
evident both in a universal monotonic increase in H-alpha EW with time
following outbursts, as systems fade, and in a comparison between measured EWs
and contemporaneous X-ray measurements. The effect is most clear for black hole
binaries in the low/hard X-ray state, which is prevalent at X-ray luminosities
below ~1% Eddington. We do not find strong evidence for significant changes in
line profiles across accretion state changes, but this is hampered by a lack of
good data at such times. The observed anti-correlation, highly significant for
black hole binaries, is only marginally so for neutron star systems, for which
there are far less data. Comparison with previously established correlations
between optical and X-ray luminosity suggest that the line luminosity is
falling as the X-ray and optical luminosities drop, but not as fast
(approximately as L_{H-alpha} \propto L_X^{~0.4} \propto L_{opt}^{~0.7}). We
briefly discuss possible origins for such an effect, including the optical
depth, form of the irradiating spectrum and geometry of the accetion flow.
Further refinement of the relation in the future may allow measurements of
H-alpha EW to be used to estimate the luminosity of, and hence the distance to,
X-ray binary systems. Beyond this, further progress will require a better

neutron shell closure occurring at $N$ approaching 16. The strongest isovector
deformation was found for 2$^+_1$ state in $^{20}$O, with $\delta_1$ about 2.5
times larger than $\delta_0$, which indicates a strong core polarization by the
valence neutrons in $^{20}$O. The ratios of the neutron/proton transition
matrix elements ($M_n/M_p$) determined for 2$^+_1$ states in $^{18,20}$O have
been compared to those deduced from the mirror symmetry, using the measured

quantum computation due to their simplicity and robustness to noise. By
definition, transversal operators do not couple physical subsystems within the
same code block. Consequently, such operators do not spread errors within code
blocks and are, therefore, fault tolerant. Nonetheless, other methods of
ensuring fault tolerance are required, as it is invariably the case that some
encoded gates cannot be implemented transversally. This observation has led to
a long-standing conjecture that transversal encoded gate sets cannot be
universal. Here we show that the ability of a quantum code to detect an
arbitrary error on any single physical subsystem is incompatible with the
existence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set for the code.

solutions, some mass being lost to a dust of zero-mass particles as a
consequence of an intensive splitting. Under some assumptions of regular
variation on the fragmentation rate, we describe the large time behavior of
solutions. Our approach is based on probabilistic tools: the solutions to the
fragmentation equation are constructed via nonincreasing self-similar Markov
processes that continuously reach 0 in finite time. Our main probabilistic
result describes the asymptotic behavior of these processes conditioned on
nonextinction and is then used for the solutions to the fragmentation equation.
We note that two parameters significantly influence these large time behaviors:
the rate of formation of ""nearly-1 relative masses"" (this rate is related to
the behavior near 0 of the L\'evy measure associated with the corresponding
self-similar Markov process) and the distribution of large initial particles.
Correctly rescaled, the solutions then converge to a nontrivial limit which is
related to the quasi-stationary solutions of the equation. Besides, these
quasi-stationary solutions, or, equivalently, the quasi-stationary
distributions of the self-similar Markov processes, are fully described.

separation can be attempted where the various Fourier frequencies are given
different weights. This is seen as a useful characteristic in the case of noisy

overestimated. Better results can be obtained if a classic procedure is adopted

addition we used new apparent jet speed data to calculate the Lorentz factors

Doppler-boosted and that the Doppler boosting factors of BL Lacertae objects
are lower than of quasars. The new Lorentz factors are about twice as high as
in earlier studies, which is mainly due to higher apparent speeds in our
analyses. The jets of BL Lacertae objects are slower than of quasars. There are
some extreme sources with very high derived Lorentz factors of the order of a
hundred. These high Lorentz factors could be real. It is also possible that the
sources exhibit such rapid flares that the fast variations have remained
undetected in monitoring programmes, or else the sources have a complicated jet

sufficient information for calculating the magnitude and the direction of the

thick samples, thus rendering this method unsuitable for state of the art bulk
superconductors. If a thin (< 1 mm) slab is cut from the bulk, the inversion is
reasonably well conditioned and the variation of the critical current density
in the sample can be calculated with adequate spatial resolution. Therefore a
novel procedure is employed, which exploits the symmetry of the problem and
solves the equations non-iteratively, assuming a planar z-independent current
density. The calculated current density at a certain position is found to
depend on the magnetic induction. In this way the average field dependence of
the critical current density Jc(B) is obtained also at low fields, which is not
accessible to magnetisation measurements due to the self-field of the sample.
It is further shown that an evaluation of magnetisation loops, taking the
self-field into account, results in a similar dependence in the field range

analyses. The polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of three
components: CMB, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. The polarized
Galactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectral
indices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and their
component maps are estimated as by-products. We apply the method to simulated
low resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and full
noise realizations drawn from the WMAP noise matrices. The CMB maps are
recovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. Computing the likelihood
of the E-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization,
tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for a
simulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations.
A `null' simulation with no polarized CMB signal has maximum likelihood
consistent with tau=0. The method is applied to the five-year WMAP data, using

tau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary WMAP
analysis. The synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over high
signal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)<0.25, but excluding
~6% of the sky masked in the Galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04. This estimate does
not vary significantly with Galactic latitude, although includes an informative

function of magnetic field also increases linearly with temperature. The
analysis of our experimental data shows that the Feshbach coupling is small

rate is proportionnal to the square of the number of atoms, and that we can

reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass spectrum of a small quantum
system (representing quant of the black hole self-interaction). Then, we show
that Kerr-Newman black hole entropy represents simply the quotient of the sum

ground mass of small quantum system on the other hand. Also we show that

that, practically, only ground mass quantum state is significantly degenerate

are described. More specifically, a notion of a {\em Morita context} comprising
of two monads, two bialgebra functors and two connecting maps is introduced. It
is shown that in many cases equivalences between categories of algebras are
induced by such Morita contexts. The Eilenberg-Moore category of
representations of a Morita context is constructed. This construction allows
one to associate two pairs of adjoint functors with right adjoint functors
having a common domain or a {\em double adjunction} to a Morita context. It is
shown that, conversely, every Morita context arises from a double adjunction.
The comparison functor between the domain of right adjoint functors in a double
adjunction and the Eilenberg-Moore category of the associated Morita context is
defined. The sufficient and necessary conditions for this comparison functor to
be an equivalence (or for the {\em moritability} of a pair of functors with a
common domain) are derived.

to superfluidity, the effects of the magnetic field on the equilibrium shape of
NSs, the internal dynamical state of a fully degenerate, oblique rotator and
the strength of the electromagnetic torque on the newly born NS. We show that
our scenario is consistent with recent studies of SNRs surrounding AXPs and
SGRs in the Galaxy that constrain the electromagnetic energy input from the
central NS to be <= 10^51 erg. We further show that if this condition is met,
then the GW signal from such sources is potentially detectable with the
forthcoming generation of GW detectors up to Virgo cluster distances where an
event rate <= 1/yr can be estimated. Finally, we point out that the decay of an
internal magnetic field in the 10^16 G range couples strongly to the NS cooling

can remain this strong for at least 10^3 yrs, during which the core temperature

readily work out the number and energy gap of the conjugate surface states,
which are intimately associated with the magnetic properties of the GQD. By
using the Hartree-Fock mean field approach, we study the size dependence of the
magnetic ordering formation in this square GQD. We find that there exists a
critical size of the width between the two zigzag edges to indicate the onset
of the stable magnetic ordering. On the other hand, when such a width increases
further, the magnetic ground state energy of a charge neutral GQD tends to a
saturated value. These results coincide with the previous results obtained from
the first principle calculation. Then, based on the Dirac equation solution
about the surface state, we establish a simple two-state model which can
quantitatively explain the size dependence of the magnetic ordering in the

According to our conjecture, short narrow magnetic loops fill the penumbral

effect and the convective transport. This scenario seems to be qualitatively
consistent with most existing observations, including the dark cores in
penumbral filaments reported by Scharmer et al. Each bright filament with dark
core would be a system of two paired convective rolls with the dark core
tracing the lane where the plasma sinks down. The magnetic loops would have a
hot footpoint in one of the bright filament and a cold footpoint in the dark
core. The scenario also fits in most of our theoretical prejudices (siphon
flows along field lines, presence of overturning convection, drag of field
lines by downdrafts, etc). If the conjecture turns out to be correct, the mild
upward and downward velocities observed in penumbrae must increase upon
improvement of the current spatial resolution. This and other observational
tests to support or disprove the proposed scenario are put forward.

assuming continuity of the electric displacement and of the electrochemical

on the gauge coupling and exhibits extremely mild critical slowing down in the

a single phonon or multiphonons in superfluid helium. The dynamic scattering
function S(q, omega) of the superfluid helium strongly depends on pressure,
leading to a pressure- dependent differential UCN production rate. A
phenomenological expression for the multiphonon part of the scattering function
s(lambda) describing UCN production has been derived from inelastic neutron
scattering data. When combined with the production rate from single phonon
processes this allows us to calculate the UCN production for any incident
neutron flux. For calculations of the UCN production from single phonon
processes we propose to use the values for S*(SVP) = 0.118(8) and S*(20 bar) =
0.066(6). As an example we will calculate the expected UCN production rate at
the cold neutron beam for fundamental physics PF1b at the Institut Laue
Langevin. We conclude that UCN production in superfluid helium under pressure
is not attractive.

process in a microcavity polariton condensate. The mechanism which is invoked
is the effect of self-phase modulation, whereby interactions transform
polariton number fluctuations into random energy variations. The model shows
that the phase coherence decay, g1(t), has a Kubo form, which can be Gaussian
or exponential, depending on whether the number fluctuations are slow or fast.
This fluctuation rate also determines the decay time of the intensity
correlation function, g2(t), so it can be directly determined experimentally.
The model explains recent experimental measurements of a relatively fast
Gaussian decay for g1(t), but also predicts a regime, further above threshold,
where the decay is much slower.

integrating out the freedom of the cavity mode, the potential felt by the

steady configurations of the system. It is found that due to the nonlinearity

answering one-dimensional range reporting queries. Given a set of $N$ keys, a
range query can be answered in $O(\log_B \nm + \frac{K}{B})$ I/Os, where $B$ is
the disk block size, $K$ the output size, and $M$ the size of the main memory
buffer. When keys are inserted or deleted, the B-tree is updated in $O(\log_B
N)$ I/Os, if we require the resulting changes to be committed to disk right
away. Otherwise, the memory buffer can be used to buffer the recent updates,
and changes can be written to disk in batches, which significantly lowers the
amortized update cost. A systematic way of batching up updates is to use the
logarithmic method, combined with fractional cascading, resulting in a dynamic
B-tree that supports insertions in $O(\frac{1}{B}\log\nm)$ I/Os and queries in
$O(\log\nm + \frac{K}{B})$ I/Os. Such bounds have also been matched by several
known dynamic B-tree variants in the database literature.
  In this paper, we prove that for any dynamic one-dimensional range query
index structure with query cost $O(q+\frac{K}{B})$ and amortized insertion cost
$O(u/B)$, the tradeoff $q\cdot \log(u/q) = \Omega(\log B)$ must hold if
$q=O(\log B)$. For most reasonable values of the parameters, we have $\nm =
B^{O(1)}$, in which case our query-insertion tradeoff implies that the bounds
mentioned above are already optimal. Our lower bounds hold in a dynamic version
of the {\em indexability model}, which is of independent interests.
