structure formation starting from Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions.
We adopt the best-fitting cosmological parameters of WMAP (3rd- and 5th-year)
and we consider non-Gaussianity of the local type parameterised by 8 different
values of the non-linearity parameter F_NL. Building upon previous work based
on the Gaussian case, we show that, expressed in terms of suitable variables,
the mass function of friends-of-friends haloes is approximately universal (i.e.
independent of redshift, cosmology, and matter transfer function) to good
precision (nearly 10 per cent) also in non-Gaussian scenarios. We provide
fitting formulae for the high-mass end (M>10^13 M_sol/h) of the universal mass
function in terms of F_NL, and we also present a non-universal fit in terms of
both F_NL and z to be used for applications requiring higher accuracy. In the
Gaussian case, we extend our fit to a wider range of halo masses (M>2.4 x 10^10
M_sol/h) and we also provide a consistent fit of the linear halo bias. We show
that, for realistic values of F_NL, the matter power-spectrum in non-Gaussian
cosmologies departs from the Gaussian one by up to 2 per cent on the scales
where the baryonic- oscillation features are imprinted on the 2-point
statistics. We confirm the strong k-dependence of the halo bias on large scales
(k<0.05 h Mpc^-1) which was already detected in previous studies. However, we
find that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak-background split do
not provide an accurate description of our simulations which present extra
dependencies on the wavenumber, the non-linearity parameter and, possibly, the
clustering strength. We provide an accurate fit of the simulation data that can
be used as a benchmark for future determinations of F_NL with galaxy surveys.

paper, we prove for a linearization of a one-dimensional quasicontinuum energy
around a uniform strain that the effect of the ghost forces on the displacement
nearly cancels and has a small effect on the error away from the interface. We
give optimal order error estimates that show that the quasicontinuum
displacement converges to the atomistic displacement at the optimal rate O($h$)
in the discrete $\ell^\infty$ norm and O($h^{1/p}$) in the $w^{1,p}$ norm for
$1 \leq p < \infty.$ where $h$ is the interatomic spacing. We also give a proof
that the error in the displacement gradient decays away from the interface to
O($h$) at distance O($h|\log h|$) in the atomistic region and distance O($h$)
in the continuum region. E, Ming, and Yang previously gave a counterexample to
convergence in the $w^{1,\infty}$ norm for a harmonic interatomic potential.
Our work gives an explicit and simplified form for the decay of the effect of

previous 2D studies have shown that gravitational scattering cannot maintain

evolution of low-mass protoplanetary swarms in three dimensions. The aim is to
examine both protoplanet survival rates and the dynamical structure of the
resulting planetary systems, and to compare them with 2D simulations. We
present results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of eight protoplanets
embedded in a protoplanetary disc. We also present a suite of simulations
performed using an N-body code, modified to include prescriptions for planetary
migration and for eccentricity and inclination damping. These prescriptions
were obtained by fitting analytic formulae to hydrodynamic simulations of
planets embedded in discs with initially eccentric and/or inclined orbits. As
was found in two dimensions, differential migration produces groups of
protoplanets in stable, multiple mean-motion resonances that migrate in
lockstep, preventing prolonged periods of gravitational scattering. In almost
all simulations, this leads to large-scale migration of the protoplanet swarm
into the central star in the absence of a viable stopping mechanism. The
evolution involves mutual collisions, occasional instances of large-scale
scattering, and the frequent formation of the long-lived, co-orbital planet
systems that arise in > 30% of all runs. Disc-induced damping overwhelms
eccentricity and inclination growth due to planet-planet interactions.
Co-orbital planets are a natural outcome of dynamical relaxation in a strongly
dissipative environment, and if observed in nature would imply that such a
period of evolution commonly arises during planetary formation.

models with relatively small mass splittings between the dark matter candidate
and the rest of the (colored) spectrum, the collider sensitivity is diminished,
but direct detection rates are enhanced. UEDs provide a natural framework for
such mass degeneracies. We consider both 5-dimensional and 6-dimensional
non-minimal UED models, and discuss the detection prospects for various KK dark
matter candidates: the KK photon \gamma_1 (5D) the KK Z-boson Z_1 (5D) and the
spinless KK photon \gamma_H (6D). We combine collider limits such as
electroweak precision data and expected LHC reach, with cosmological
constraints from WMAP and the sensitivity of current or planned direct
detection experiments. Allowing for general mass splittings, we show that
neither colliders, nor direct detection experiments by themselves can explore
all of the relevant KK dark matter parameter space. Nevertheless, they probe
different parameter space regions and the combination of the two types of
constraints can be quite powerful. For example, in the case of \gamma_1 in 5D
UEDs the relevant parameter space will be almost completely covered by the
combined LHC and direct detection sensitivities expected in the near future.

concerns that the stakeholders communicate. These include beliefs, desires,
intentions, and attitudes. In response, we propose a core ontology that covers
these concerns and is grounded in sound conceptual foundations resting on a

Optimal Control Problems (FOCPs) formulated in Agrawal (2004) where a
Fractional Derivative (FD) is defined in the Riemann-Liouville sense. In this
scheme, the entire time domain is divided into several sub-domains, and a
fractional derivative (FDs) at a time node point is approximated using a
modified Gr\""{u}nwald-Letnikov approach. For the first order derivative, the
proposed modified Gr\""{u}nwald-Letnikov definition leads to a central
difference scheme. When the approximations are substituted into the Fractional
Optimal Control (FCO) equations, it leads to a set of algebraic equations which
are solved using a direct numerical technique. Two examples, one time-invariant
and the other time-variant, are considered to study the performance of the
numerical scheme. Results show that 1) as the order of the derivative
approaches an integer value, these formulations lead to solutions for integer
order system, and 2) as the sizes of the sub-domains are reduced, the solutions
converge. It is hoped that the present scheme would lead to stable numerical
methods for fractional differential equations and optimal control problems.

Self-Learning KMC (SLKMC) [1] is released, leaving atoms free to occupy
Off-Lattice positions to accommodate several processes responsible for
small-cluster diffusion, periphery atom motion and hetero-epitaxial growth. The
technique combines the ideas embedded in the SLKMC method with a new pattern
recognition scheme fitted to an Off-Lattice model in which relative atomic
positions is used to characterize and store configurations. Application of a
combination of the drag and the Repulsive Bias Potential (RBP) methods for
saddle points searches, allows the treatment of concerted cluster, and multiple

reveal several new atomic mechanisms which contribute to cluster migration. We

from the Embedded Atom Method. For the hetero system Cu/Ag(111), this technique

effect of viscous dissipation. Neglecting this process leads to a dynamical
system which includes a decoupled (generalized) Lorenz system. The
consideration of this process breaks an important symmetry, couples the
dynamics of fast and slow variables, ensuing modifications of the structural
properties of the attractor and of the spectral features. When the relevant
nondimensional number (Eckert number Ec) is different from zero, the system is
ergodic and hyperbolic, the slow variables feature long term memory with 1/f
3/2 power spectra, and the fast variables feature amplitude modulation on time
scale of 1/Ec. Increasing the strength of the thermal-viscous feedback has a
stabilizing effect, as both the metric entropy and the Kaplan-Yorke attractor
dimension decrease monotonically with Ec. The analyzed system features very
rich dynamics: it overcomes some of the limitations of the Lorenz system and
might have prototypical value in relevant processes in complex systems
dynamics, such as the interaction between slow and fast variables. the presence
of long term memory and the associated extreme value statistics. Analysis shows
how, neglecting the coupling of slow and fast variables only on the basis of
scale analysis can be catastrophic. In fact, this leads to spurious invariances
that affect essential dynamical properties (ergodicity, hyperbolicity) and that
cause the model losing ability in describing intrinsically multiscale

luminosity evolution is assumed for FSRQs and exponential and power law
evolution models are examined. Due to the small number of sources, the low

upper limit. BL Lac luminosity function shows no signature of break. As a
consistency check, the model source distributions deriving from these

inductively-coupled acetylene-argon plasma for various substrate bias voltages
and frequencies under conditions suitable for film deposition. These are
compared with those obtained at the grounded wall of a capacitively coupled
plasma. In the former, for pressures up to 25 mTorr, the IEDs exhibit bimodal
structures with peak separation values that follow the expected dependence on
voltage and frequency. At higher pressures, 120 mTorr, the bimodal structure is
replaced by a single peak. For all conditions, the dominant ion is Ar+ or ArH+
despite a set C2H2:Ar flow ratio of 2:1, and this can be attributed to the high
electron dissociation of the parent molecule. Diamond-like carbon films
indicate a peak hardness at an ion energy of around 90 eV and a very sharp fall
in hardness is noted beyond this value. This is similar to the observed
bombardment energy relationship for sp3 bond formation in hydrogen-free
tetragonal amorphous carbon or bias-sputtered films. However, due to the lack
of carbon-based ions, an alternative film growth mechanism must be considered,
possibly based on argon knock-on implantation of surface adsorbed carbon
species. The results have shown that the use of high frequency bias or bias
harmonics may lead to much narrower ion energy distributions.

are present in the staggered (asqtad) formulation, but not in the overlap and
""chirally-improved"" formulations. We argue that this is due to the absence of a
field-independent chiral symmetry in the latter formulations, when the Dirac
operator is evaluated on the very rough configurations generated by center
projection. We also confirm and extend the results of Kovalenko et al. [Phys.
Lett. B 648, 383 (2007)], finding strong correlations between center vortex
locations, and the scalar density of low-lying Dirac eigenmodes on unprojected
lattices, in both asqtad and overlap formulations. It is found that the
low-lying eigenmodes have their largest concentrations in point-like regions,
rather than on submanifolds of higher dimensionality.

properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly
applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in
natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the
words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular

corrections in higher orders, why the renormalizations work and how to
reformulate the theory in order to avoid these technical and conceptual
complications. I demonstrate that the perturbative mass and charge corrections
are caused exclusively with the kinetic nature of the interaction Lagrangian.
As soon as it is not purely quantum mechanical (or QFT) specific feature, the
problem can be demonstrated on a classical two-body problem. The latter can be
solved in different ways, one of them being correct and good for applying the
perturbation theory (if necessary) and another one being tricky and awkward.
The first one is physically and technically natural - it is a
center-of-inertia-and-relative-variable formulation. The second one - mixed
variable formulation - is unnecessarily complicated and leads to the mass and
charge corrections even in the Newtonian mechanics of two bound bodies. The
perturbation theory in QFT is factually formulated in the mixed variables -
that is why it brings corrections to the fundamental constants. This
understanding opens a way of correctly formulating the QFT equations and thus
to simplify the QFT calculations technically and conceptually. For example, in
scattering problems in QED it means accounting exactly the quantized
electromagnetic field influence in the free in and out states of charged
particles so no infrared and ultraviolet problems arise. In bound states it
means obtaining the energy corrections (the Lamb shift, the anomalous magnetic
moment) quite straightforwardly and without renormalizations.

found from host-galaxy spectra. Moreover, the phases derived from only the SN
Ia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. By
comparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objects
similar to the overluminous SN 1991T and the underluminous SN 1991bg in our
sample are consistent with that of the local sample. We do note, however, that
we detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to SN 1991bg.
Although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect based
on the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia are less
prevalent at high redshift.

Processes leading to
the suppression of star formation and morphological transformation are
prevalent: this is particularly evident in the dramatic upturn in the fraction
of S0-type galaxies in clusters. However, until now, the process and
environment of formation has remained unidentified. We present a HST-based
morphological analysis of galaxies in the redshift-space selected group and
field environments at z~0.4. Groups contain a much higher fraction of S0s at
fixed luminosity than the lower density field, with >99.999% confidence. Indeed
the S0 fraction in groups is at least as high as in z~0.4 clusters and X-ray
selected groups, which have more luminous Intra Group Medium (IGM). An 97%
confident excess of S0s at >=0.3Mpc from the group centre at fixed luminosity,
tells us that formation is not restricted to, and possibly even avoids, the
group cores. Interactions with a bright X-ray emitting IGM cannot be important
for the formation of the majority of S0s in the Universe. In contrast to S0s,
the fraction of elliptical galaxies in groups at fixed luminosity is similar to
the field, whilst the brightest ellipticals are strongly enhanced towards the
group centres (>99.999% confidence within 0.3Mpc). We conclude that the group
and sub-group environments must be dominant for the formation of S0 galaxies,
and that minor mergers, galaxy harassment and tidal interactions are the most
likely responsible mechanisms. This has implications not only for the inferred
pre-processing of cluster galaxies, but also for the global morphological and
star formation budget of galaxies: as hierarchical clustering progresses, more
galaxies will be subject to these transformations as they enter the group
environment.

Monte Carlo is undesirable for the estimation of small probabilities because

captured in cavities. For a given cavity with a certain size, the fundamental

to $\tau$, and so that the frequency change $\Delta${\it f} $\gg \delta${\it

demonstrate superconducting microwave cavities, with tunable effective lengths.
The tuning is obtained by varying a Josephson inductance at one end of the

several hundred linewidths in a time $\Delta t \ll \tau$. Working in the few

models for such data. In this paper we focus on learning class-level or
first-order dependencies, which model the general database statistics over
attributes of linked objects and links (e.g., the percentage of A grades given
in computer science classes). Class-level statistical relationships are
important in themselves, and they support applications like policy making,
strategic planning, and query optimization. Most current SRL methods find
class-level dependencies, but their main task is to support instance-level
predictions about the attributes or links of specific entities. We focus only
on class-level prediction, and describe algorithms for learning class-level
models that are orders of magnitude faster for this task. Our algorithms learn
Bayes nets with relational structure, leveraging the efficiency of single-table
nonrelational Bayes net learners. An evaluation of our methods on three data
sets shows that they are computationally feasible for realistic table sizes,
and that the learned structures represent the statistical information in the
databases well. After learning compiles the database statistics into a Bayes
net, querying these statistics via Bayes net inference is faster than with SQL
queries, and does not depend on the size of the database.

account for the physics of that entire universe: the remainder is just a set of
redundant copies of the interior of a single cosmic horizon. These copies must
be factored out, just as one has to factor out gauge redundancies to identify
the true degrees of freedom in gauge theory. Motivated by the observation that
quantum cosmology favours compactified negatively curved spatial sections, we
propose to use such geometries to implement horizon complementarity for eternal
Inflation. We point out that the ""effective finiteness"" of such universes has
important consequences for physics inside the observer's horizon: there is a
non-local effect, represented by a Casimir energy. We use our proposed
interpretation of complementarity to constrain the gravitational Casimir
coupling in two very different ways; the result is an explicit prediction for

concentration gradients of this second chemical, analogous to diffusive
echolocation. When one target is present, we describe probe release strategies

We present a complete characterization of the mixing properties of the
hypercube QRW under a physically relevant Markovian decoherence model. In the
local decoherence model considered the non-unitary dynamics are modeled as a
sum of projections on individual qubits to an arbitrary direction on the Bloch
sphere. We prove that there is always classical (asymptotic) mixing in this
model and specify the conditions under which instantaneous mixing
\textit{always} exists. And we show that the latter mixing property, as well as
the classical mixing time, depend heavily on the exact environmental
interaction and its strength. Therefore, algorithmic applications of the QRW on
the hypercube, if they intend to employ mixing properties, need to consider
both the walk dynamics and the precise decoherence model.

With these spectral fits we inferred a cluster membership criterium, as well as
the ages, dust extinctions, and photometric types of these fLSBs. We show that
about half of the Coma cluster fLSBs have a spectral energy distribution well
represented in our template library while the other half present a flux deficit
at ultraviolet wavelengths. Among the well represented, ~80% are probably part
of the Coma cluster based on their spectral energy distribution. They are
relatively young (younger than 2.3 Gyrs for 90% of the sample) non-starburst
objects. The later their type, the younger fLSBs are. A significant part of the
fLSBs are quite dusty objects. fLSBs are low stellar mass objects (the later
their type the less massive they are), with stellar masses comparable to
globular clusters for the faintest ones. Their characteristics are correlated
with infall directions, confirming the disruptive origin for part of them.

consequence of the zero rest mass, conformal non-invariance of gravitons, and
1-loop finiteness of quantum gravity (QG). The effect is due to graviton-ghost
condensates arising from the interference of quantum coherent states. The
theory is constructed as follows: Faddeev-Popov-De Witt gauged path integral ->
factorization of classical and quantum variables -> transition to the 1-loop
approximation -> choice of ghost sector, satisfying 1-loop finiteness of the
theory off the mass shell. The Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY)
chain for the spectral function of gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to
build a theory of gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact
solutions of the equations that describe virtual graviton and ghost condensates
as well as condensates of instanton fluctuations. Exact solutions correspond to
various condensates with different graviton-ghost compositions. The formalism
of the BBGKY chain takes into account the contribution of non-relativistic
matter in the formation of a common self-consistent gravitational field. It is
shown that the era of non-relativistic matter dominance must be replaced by an
era of dominance of graviton-ghost condensate. Pre-asymptotic state of DE is a
condensate of virtual gravitons and ghosts with a constant conformal
wavelength. The asymptotic state predicted by the theory is a graviton-ghost
condensate of constant physical wavelength in the De Sitter space. Such DE
phenomenon is presented in the form of the model that interpolates the exact
solutions of equations of 1-loop QG. Processing of observational DE data
extracted from the Hubble diagram for supernovae SNIa suggests that the
graviton-ghost condensate is an adequate variable component of DE.

considers a solution to the Einstein equations for a general matter

Such an approach became of considerable interest when it was shown that it

this paper we compare the LambdaCDM model and the backreation models with SNIa,
BAO, and CMB data, and find that the former is favoured. However, the tested

average spatial curvature and the backreaction, as well as the relation between
the curvature and curvature index. In this paper we modified the latter
assumption, leaving the former unchanged. We find that, by varying the relation
between the curvature and curvature index, we can obtain a better fit.
Therefore, some further work is still needed -- in particular the relation
between the backreaction and the curvature should be revisited in order to
fully determine the feasibility of the backreaction models to mimic dark
energy.

For all three nuclei in the x = 0.1 material, it is found that the local Knight
shift increases monotonically with an increase in temperature, and scales with
the macroscopic susceptibility, suggesting a single magnetic degree of freedom.
Surprisingly, the spin lattice relaxation rates for all nuclei also scale with
one another, despite the fact that the form factors for each site sample
different regions of q-space. This result suggests a lack of any q-space
structure in the dynamical spin susceptibility that might be expected in the
presence of antiferromagnetic correlations. Rather, our results are more
compatible with simple quasi-particle scattering. Furthermore, we find that the
increase in the electric field gradient at the As cannot be accounted for by
LDA calculations, suggesting that structural changes, in particular the
position of the As in the unit cell, dominate the NQR response.

The interface is modeled by a jump either in the value or the derivative of

perfectly periodic operator. The periodic potentials on each side of the
interface can, moreover, be different. As we show, eigenvalues can only occur
in spectral gaps. We pose the eigenvalue problem as a $C^1$ gluing problem for
the fundamental solutions (Bloch functions) of the second order ODEs on each
side of the interface. The problem is thus reduced to finding matchings of the
ratio functions $R_\pm=\frac{\psi_\pm'(0)}{\psi_\pm(0)}$, where $\psi_\pm$ are
those Bloch functions that decay on the respective half-lines. These ratio
functions are analyzed with the help of the Pr\""{u}fer transformation. The
limit values of $R_\pm$ at band edges depend on the ordering of Dirichlet and
Neumann eigenvalues at gap edges. We show that the ordering can be determined
in the first two gaps via variational analysis for potentials satisfying
certain monotonicity conditions. Numerical computations of interface
eigenvalues are presented to corroborate the analysis.

orbits around the unstable Lagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$ of a barred galaxy
define loci in the configuration space which take the form of a trailing spiral
pattern. In the present paper we investigate this association in the case of
the self-consistent models of Kaufmann & Contopoulos (1996) which provide an
approximation of real barred-spiral galaxies. We also examine the relation of
`response' models of barred-spiral galaxies with the theory of the invariant
manifolds. Our main results are the following: The invariant manifolds yield
the correct form of the imposed spiral pattern provided that their calculation
is done with the spiral potential term turned on. We provide a theoretical
model explaining the form of the invariant manifolds that supports the spiral
structure. The azimuthal displacement of the Lagrangian points with respect to
the bar's major axis is a crucial parameter in this modeling. When this is
taken into account, the manifolds necessarily develop in a spiral-like domain
of the configuration space, delimited from below by the boundary of a
banana-like non-permitted domain, and from above either by rotational KAM tori
or by cantori forming a stickiness zone. We construct `spiral response' models
on the basis of the theory of the invariant manifolds and examine the
connection of the latter to the `response' models (Patsis 2006) used to fit
real barred-spiral galaxies, explaining how are the manifolds related to a
number of morphological features seen in such models.

temperature, T_D, that, in turn, was calculated from the temperature dependence
of the central shift of the Mossbauer spectra recorded in the range of 80 to
330 K. Following a temperature dependence of the line width that shows a
minimum at ~155 K, two temperature intervals were considered: a low temperature
one (LT) ranging from 80 to 155 K, and the T_D - value of 292 (12) K or 279

(non-functorial) equivalence between localic \'etale groupoids, on one hand,

pseudogroups), on the other. This correspondence is mediated by a class of
quantales, known as inverse quantal frames, that are obtained from the inverse
semigroups by a simple join completion that yields an equivalence of

essentially ``the same'' as inverse quantal frames, and in this paper we
exploit this fact in order to find a suitable replacement for inverse
semigroups in the context of open groupoids that are not necessarily \'etale.
The interest of such a generalization lies in the importance and ubiquity of
open groupoids in areas such as operator algebras, differential geometry and
topos theory, and we achieve it by means of a class of quantales, called open
quantal frames, which generalize inverse quantal frames and whose properties we
study in detail. The resulting correspondence between quantales and open

concerning \'etale groupoids, and it depends heavily on the existence of
inverse semigroups of local bisections of the quantales involved.

effect of the relaxation of the cosmological constant is observed both for
negative and positive values of $\Lambda$ and for a range of model parameters.
A special emphasis is put on the study of the details of the CC relaxation

cosmological constant at large scale factor values is small because the
absolute value of the real cosmological constant is large.

normal crossing singularities after a suitable modification. We focus on the
analytic equivalence of such functions with only normal crossing singularities.
We prove that for such functions $C^{\infty}$ right equivalence implies
analytic equivalence. We prove moreover that the cardinality of the set of
equivalence classes is zero or countable.

field having the potential which arises in the conformal frame of high order
gravity theories, coupled to matter described by a perfect fluid with energy
density $\rho$ and pressure $p$, obeying a barotropic equation of state. The
solutions are shown to evolve generically to a singular state in a finite time
and they are used as sources for radiating objects undergoing complete
gravitational collapse. Although these singularities may be naked in some
special case, it is shown that generically a black hole forms.

information on the $\cp$-even Higgs bosons, allowing to probe interesting
regions of the $\MA$--$\tb$ parameter plane. The sensitivity of the searches in
the forward proton mode for the Higgs bosons in the so-called CDM-benchmark
scenarios and the effects of fourth-generation models on the CED Higgs
production are briefly discussed.
