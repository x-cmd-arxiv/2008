structure with magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) fluctuations. The electromagnetic
field is represented as a sum of MHD shock solution ($\Mag_0, \Ele_0$) and
torsional Alfven modes spectra ($\delta \Mag, \delta \Ele $). We represent
fluctuation modes in logarithmic wavenumber space. Since the electromagnetic
fields are represented analytically, our simulations can easily cover as large
as eight orders of magnitude in resonant frequency, and do not suffer from
spatial limitations of box size or grid spacing. We deterministically calculate
the particle trajectories under the Lorenz force for time interval of up to ten
years, with a time step of $\sim 0.5 \sec$. This is sufficient to resolve
Larmor frequencies without a stochastic treatment. Simulations show that the
efficiency of the first order Fermi acceleration can be parametrized by the
fluctuation amplitude $\eta \equiv < \delta B^2 > ^{\frac 1 2} {B_0}^{-1}$ .
Convergence of the numerical results is shown by increasing the number of wave
modes in Fourier space while fixing $\eta$. Efficiency of the first order Fermi
acceleration has a maximum at $ \eta \simeq 10^1$. The acceleration rate
depends on the angle between the shock normal and $\Mag_0$, and is highest when
the angle is zero. Our method will provide a convenient tool for comparing
collisionless turbulence theories with, for example, observations of bipolar

This mechanism is caused by a $\pm{M}$ symmetry breaking of the collisional

  Our aim here is two-fold. At the first place we try to explain methods and

push forward the methods to obtain a better constant for the possible
concentration (in $L^1$ norm) of an idempotent on an arbitrary symmetric

$\gamma_1>0.96$, which contradicts strongly the conjecture of Anderson et al.
that there is no positive concentration in $L^1$ norm.

cosmological backgrounds. The inflationary solutions are argued to guarantee
the vanishing of the corresponding Weyl anomaly coefficients in a given
world-sheet renormalization scheme, thereby ensuring conformal invariance of
the corresponding sigma-model to all orders in the Regge slope. The key
property is the requirement of ""homogeneity"" of the corresponding Weyl anomaly
coefficients. Inflation entails appropriate relations between the dilaton and
tachyon field configurations, whose form can lead to either a de Sitter vacuum,
incompatible though (due to the cosmic horizons) with the perturbative string
scattering amplitudes, or to cosmic space-times involving brief inflationary
periods, interpolating smoothly between power-law and/or Minkowski Universes.
The latter situation is characterized by well-defined scattering amplitudes,

relevant to a perfect crystal (immobile) in which there is a frictionless flow
of atoms, which testifies to the possibility of superfluidity in ideal solids.
The solutions are studied with the help of the bifurcation method and some
their peculiarities are found out. Various physical aspects of the problem,

protoplanetary disc and subsequently accrete gas to become gas giants. We
calculate their evolution before, during, and after gas disc dispersal. A
two-dimensional hydrodynamics code combined with an N-body solver is used to
evolve the system of disc and planets. Gas disc dispersal is simulated in a
simple manner by assuming global exponential decay of the disc mass, leading to
the stalling of migration after semi-major axes have approximately halved from
their initial values. We consider Trojan pairs with different initial masses
and gas accretion rates and gas disc models with different masses and
viscosities. An N-body code, adapted to model disc forces, is used to examine
large-scale migration and the formation of very short period Trojan planets.
For each combination of planetary pair and disc model that we consider in our
hydrodynamic simulations, each Trojan system remains stable before, during, and
after disc dispersal. The long-term stability of these systems in the absence
of gas is tested using N-body simulations, and all systems remain stable for
those evolution times equal to 10^9 years. Eccentricities remain low (e<0.02)
in all cases. Increases in the amplitude of libration about the L4/L5 Lagrange
points accompany the inward migration, and during very large-scale migration
Trojan systems may be disrupted prior to the onset of disc dispersal. The
stability of Trojan pairs during rapid type I migration, during the transition
to type II migration with the accompanying gap formation in the gas disc, and
during gas loss when the disc disperses, indicates that isolated Trojan planet
systems are very stable. If a common mechanism exists for their formation, we
suggest they may be readily observed in nature.

this system, the enlarged FeAs4 tetrahedron resulting from larger radius of Sr

similarities to quantum logic. However, due to the lack of the collapse of
wavefunction and due to the immediate accessibility of superposition
components, the use of noise-based and quantum computers will probably be
different. Another example is secure communications where, out of the
unconditional security at idealistic situations, a practical security beyond
known quantum solutions can be achieved and has been demonstrated. Here the
keys to security are the robustness of classical information, and the second

two-qubit system with correlated spins exhibits completely different evolution
properties than that encoded in states with the anti-correlated spins. A
complete and abrupt loss of the entanglement, called the entanglement sudden
death, can be found to occur for the spin correlated states, but the
entanglement evolves without any discontinuity or decays asymptotically for the
spin anti-correlated states. We consider the evolution of an initial
entanglement encoded in the spin anti-correlated states and demonstrate that
the asymptotic behavior predicted before occurs only in the weak coupling limit
or equivalently when the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the
interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits with the field. If we do not restrict
ourselves to the RWA, we find that the entanglement undergoes a discontinuity,
the sudden death phenomenon. We illustrate this behavior by employing an
efficient scheme for entanglement evolution between two cold-trapped atoms
located inside a single-mode cavity. Although only a single excitation is
initially present in the system, we find that the two-photon excited state,
which plays the key role for the discontinuity in the behavior of the
entanglement, gains a population over a short time of the evolution. When the
RWA is made on the interaction, the two-photon excited state remains
unpopulated for all times and the discontinuity is absent. We attribute this
phenomenon to the principle of complementarity between the evolution time and
energy, and the presence of the counter-rotating terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian.

expected to be negligible due to the low abundance of the neutron source 22Ne,
to primary neutron poisons and decreasing iron seed abundances. However, recent
models of massive stars including the effects of rotation show that a strong
production of 22Ne is possible in the helium core, as a consequence of the
primary nitrogen production (observed in halo metal poor stars). Using the PPN
post-processing code, we studied the impact of this primary 22Ne on the s
process. We find a large production of s elements between strontium and barium,
starting with the amount of primary 22Ne predicted by stellar models. There are
several key reaction rate uncertainties influencing the s-process efficiency.
Among them, 17O(alpha,gamma) may play a crucial role strongly influencing the s
process efficiency, or it may play a negligible role, according to the rate
used in the calculations. We also report on the development of a new parallel
(MPI) post-processing code (MPPNP) designed to follow the complete
nucleosynthesis in stars on highly resolved grids. We present here the first
post-processing run from the ZAMS up to the end of helium burning for a 15
solar mass model.

stars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of open
questions yet to be explored. Although stochastic oscillations have previously
been detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometric
measurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was not
complete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. The
quality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the CoRoT satellite is
necessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in red
giants. We have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400
relatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of CoRoT during the first 150
days long-run campaign from May to October 2007. We find several hundred stars
showing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected for
red-giant pulsators. In this paper we present first results on a sub-sample of
these stars. Aims. Knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radius
is essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. As the
CoRoT exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or only
weak) constraints on the star's location in the H-R diagram. We therefore aim
to extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from the
available time series. Methods. We model the convective background noise and
the power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deduce
reliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations for
the frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequency
separation.

both the systems undergo a phase transition to a superconducting vortex-ordered

apparent contradiction with the theoretical expectation that frustration
effects in the $f=1/3$ system are particularly strong enough to suppress a
vortex-ordering transition down to near zero temperature. The data for $f=1/2$
are more consistent with theoretical evaluations. The agreement between the
experiments and the Monte Carlo simulations of a $XY$ model for $f=1/3$
suggests that the order-from-disorder mechanism for the removal of an
accidental degeneracy may still be effective in the $f=1/3$ system. The

experience a much slower critical relaxation than other frustrated arrays only

initial state of the qubit of interest S by measuring three commuting
observables and therefore by means of a single apparatus, for the total system
S + A at a later time. The determinant of the matrix of the linear
transformation connecting the measurements of three commuting observables at
time t > 0 to the components of the polarization vector of S at time t = 0 is
used as an indicator of the reconstructability of the initial state of the

total system S + A and such a determinant exists, and that for a pure state a
vanishing entanglement individuates, without a need for any measurement, those
intervals of time for which the reconstruction procedure is least efficient.

observations include the following: 1. Large Scale Velocity Flows (LCDM
predicts significantly smaller amplitude and scale of flows than what
observations indicate), 2. Brightness of Type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) at High
Redshift z (LCDM predicts fainter SnIa at High z), 3. Emptiness of Voids (LCDM
predicts more dwarf or irregular galaxies in voids than observed), 4. Profiles
of Cluster Haloes (LCDM predicts shallow low concentration and density profiles
in contrast to observations which indicate denser high concentration cluster
haloes) 5. Profiles of Galaxy Haloes (LCDM predicts halo mass profiles with
cuspy cores and low outer density while lensing and dynamical observations
indicate a central core of constant density and a flattish high dark mass
density outer profile), 6. Sizable Population of Disk Galaxies (LCDM predicts a
smaller fraction of disk galaxies due to recent mergers expected to disrupt
cold rotationally supported disks). Even though the origin of some of the above
challenges may be astrophysical or related to dark matter properties, it should
be stressed that even on galactic and cluster scales, the effects of dark
energy on the equilibrium and stability of astrophysical systems are not
negligible and they may play a key role in the resolution of the above puzzles.
Here, I briefly review these six challenges of LCDM and discuss the possible
dark energy properties required for their resolution.

CoRoT provide photometric evidence of solar type oscillations in a star other
than our Sun. The first published reduction, analysis, and interpretation of
the CoRoT data yielded a spectrum of p-modes with l = 0, 1, and 2. Aims: We
present our own analysis of the CoRoT data in an attempt to compare the
detected pulsation modes with eigenfrequencies of models that are consistent
with the observed luminosity and surface temperature. Methods: We used the
Gruberbauer et al. frequency set derived based on a more conservative Bayesian
analysis with ignorance priors and fit models from a dense grid of model
spectra. We also introduce a Bayesian approach to searching and quantifying the
best model fits to the observed oscillation spectra. Results: We identify 26
frequencies as radial and dipolar modes. Our best fitting model has solar
composition and coincides within the error box with the spectroscopically
determined position of HD49933 in the H-R diagram. We also show that
lower-than-solar Z models have a lower probability of matching the observations
than the solar metallicity models. To quantify the effect of the deficiencies
in modeling the stellar surface layers in our analysis, we compare adiabatic
and nonadiabatic model fits and find that the latter reproduces the observed
frequencies better.

different phases in terms of their ability to act as a quantum wire. As far as
quantum information is concerned, we need only consider the transmission of
entanglement as the direct transmission of a quantum state is equivalent. The
isotropic anti-ferromagnetic spin chain is found to be the optimal point of the
phase diagram for the transmission of quantum entanglement when one considers
both the amount of transmitted entanglement, as well as the velocity with which
it is transmitted. But this optimal point in the phase diagram moves to the
Neel phase when decoherence or thermal fluctuations are taken to account. This
chain may also be able to transfer classical information even when, due to a
large magnitude of the noise, quantum information is not transmitted at all.
For a certain range of anisotropies of the model, a curious feature is found in
the flow of quantum information inside the chain, namely, a hopping mode of
entanglement transfer which skips the odd numbered sites. Our predictions will
potentially be testable in several physical systems.

non-Gaussian tail due to close encounters with kinks. The dispersion of the

simulations by Fraisse et al.. On the other hand, the non-Gaussian tail
contains two phenomenological parameters which are determined by comparison

mixed Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of non-amphiphilic carbazole
(CA) molecules mixed with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and stearic acid (SA).
pi-A isotherm studies of mixed monolayer and as well as also the collapse
pressure study of isotherms definitely conclude that CA is incorporated into
PMMA and SA matrices. However CA is stacked in the PMMA/SA chains and forms
microcrystalline aggregates as is evidenced from the scanning electron
micrograph picture. Nature of these aggregated species in the mixed LB films
has been revealed by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies.
The presence of two different kinds of band systems in the fluorescence spectra
of the mixed LB films have been observed. This may be due to the formation of
low dimensional aggregates in the mixed LB films. Intensity distribution of
different band system is highly sensitive to the microenvironment of two
different matrices as well as also on the film thickness

of CeO$_2$ nanoclusters, even in those films which appear to be single phase in

increases, while the saturation magnetization decreases and stays well below
the theoretical value for electron-doped La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ with mixed
Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{2+}$ valences. The same trend is observed with decreasing film
thickness from 100 to 20 nm, indicating a higher oxygen content for thinner
films. Hall measurements on a film which shows a metal-to-insulator transition
clearly reveal holes as dominating charge carriers. Combining data from x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy, for determination of the oxygen content, and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), for determination of the hole concentration and
cation valences, we find that with increasing oxygen content the hole
concentration increases and Mn valences are shifted from 2+ to 4+. The
dominating Mn valences in the films are Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$, and only a
small amount of Mn$^{2+}$ ions can be observed by XAS. Mn$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$
XAS signals obtained in surface-sensitive total electron yield mode are
strongly reduced in the bulk-sensitive fluorescence mode, which indicates
hole-doping in the bulk for those films which do show a metal-to-insulator

the Solar System where plasma precipitates directly on the surface (for
instance, Mercury, Moon, Europa). In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one
of the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object
(NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon
Stimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact
Vaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks
at a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release
processes produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in
the energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms
- SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to
NEO's extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give
important information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental
composition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function
of the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for
obtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting
clues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this

different 13C nuclear spin concentration is investigated. It is shown that
coherent control of up to three individual nuclei in a dense nuclear spin
cluster is feasible. The free induction decays of nuclear spin Bell states and
single nuclear coherences among 13C nuclear spins are compared and analyzed.
Reduction of a free induction decay time T2* and a coherence time T2 upon
increase of nuclear spin concentration has been found. For diamond material
with depleted concentration of nuclear spin, T2* as long as 30 microseconds and
T2 of up to 1.8 ms for the electron spin has been observed. The 13C
concentration dependence of T2* is explained by Fermi contact and dipolar
interactions with nuclei in the lattice. It has been found that T2 decreases
approximately as 1/n, where n is 13C concentration, as expected for an electron
spin interacting with a nuclear spin bath.

relativistic energy from laser pulse in a period of several femtoseconds and
driven away by the ponderomotive force of laser pulse, a huge charge-separation
field pulse is generated. In general cases, the ion acceleration is determined
by this charge-separation field. A novel general time-dependent solution for
laser-plasma isothermal expansions into a vacuum with different types of the
scale length of the density gradient which correspond to different charge
separation forms is obtained. The previous solutions are some special cases of
our general solution. A series of new solutions have been proposed and may be
used to predict new mechanisms of ion acceleration. However, many unaccounted
idiographic solutions that may be used to reveal new acceleration mode of ions
such as shock wave acceleration, may be deduced from our general solutions.

the combined effects of the three legs lead to an over-constrained mechanism

open microresonators is studied both theoretically and experimentally. To solve
the equations governing the dynamics of electromagnetic fields the method of
eigen-mode separation is applied previously developed with reference to
inhomogeneous systems subject to arbitrary external static potential. We prove
theoretically that it is the gradient mechanism of wave-surface scattering
which is the highly responsible for non-dissipative loss in the resonator. The
influence of side-boundary inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum is shown
to be described in terms of effective renormalization of mode wave numbers
jointly with azimuth indices in the characteristic equation. To study
experimentally the effect of inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum, the
method of modeling in the millimeter wave range is applied. As a model object
we use dielectric disc resonator (DDR) fitted with external inhomogeneities
randomly arranged at its side boundary. Experimental results show good
agreement with theoretical predictions as regards the predominance of the
gradient scattering mechanism. It is shown theoretically and confirmed in the
experiment that TM oscillations in the DDR are less affected by surface
inhomogeneities than TE oscillations with the same azimuth indices. The DDR
model chosen for our study as well as characteristic equations obtained
thereupon enable one to calculate both the eigen-frequencies and the Q-factors
of resonance spectral lines to fairly good accuracy. The results of
calculations agree well with obtained experimental data.

studied up to 1.1 GPa in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 54 T. According to
band structure calculations, its Fermi surface can be regarded as a network of
compensated orbits. The SdH spectra exhibit many Fourier components typical of
such a network, most of them being forbidden in the framework of the
semiclassical model. Their amplitude remains large in all the pressure range
studied which likely rules out chemical potential oscillation as a dominant
contribution to their origin, in agreement with recent calculations relevant to
compensated Fermi liquids. In addition to a strong decrease of the magnetic
breakdown field and effective masses, the latter being likely due to a
reduction of the strength of electron correlations, a sizeable increase of the
scattering rate is observed as the applied pressure increases. This latter
point, which is at variance with data of most charge transfer salts is
discussed in connection with pressure-induced features of the temperature
dependence of the zero-field interlayer resistance

Z/nZ x Z/nZ. Such a sequence is called zero-sum free, if no subsequence has sum
zero. It is known that the maximal length of such a zero-sum free sequence is
2n-2, and Gao and Geroldinger conjectured that every zero-sum free sequence of
this length contains an element with multiplicity at least n-2. By recent
results of Gao, Geroldinger and Grynkiewicz, it essentially suffices to verify
the conjecture for n prime. Now fix a sequence (a_i) of length 2n-2 with
maximal multiplicity of elements at most n-3. There are different approeaches
to show that (a_i) contains a zero-sum; some work well when (a_i) does contain
elements with high multiplicity, others work well when all multiplicities are
small. The aim of this article is to initiate a systematic approach to property
B via the highest occurring multiplicities. Our main results are the following:
denote by m_1 >= m_2 the two maximal multiplicities of (a_i), and suppose that
n is sufficiently big and prime. Then (a_i) contains a zero-sum in any of the
following cases: when m_2 >= 2/3n, when m_1 > (1-c)n, and when m_2 < cn, for
some constant c > 0 not depending on anything.

only, but interestingly depends neither on the bias strength nor on the

the limit of normal diffusion. The results of the analytical heuristic theory
