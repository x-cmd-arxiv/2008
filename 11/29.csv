determining the low-energy properties of string vacua. We demonstrate that
useful predictions about the RG dynamics of a quiver gauge theory may be
extracted from the global structure of its quiver diagram. For quiver theories
of a certain type, we develop an efficient and practical method for determining
which superpotential deformations generate a flow to an interacting conformal

spectrum. It consists in adding a spread signal into the host document. This
signal is obtained by the sum of a set of carrier vectors, which are modulated
by the bits to be embedded. To extract these embedded bits, weighted
correlations between the watermarked document and the carriers are computed.
Unfortunately, even without any attack, the obtained set of bits can be
corrupted due to the interference with the host signal (host interference) and
also due to the interference with the others carriers (inter-symbols
interference (ISI) due to the non-orthogonality of the carriers). Some recent
watermarking algorithms deal with host interference using side informed
methods, but inter-symbols interference problem is still open. In this paper,
we deal with interference cancellation methods, and we propose to consider ISI
as side information and to integrate it into the host signal. This leads to a
great improvement of extraction performance in term of signal-to-noise ratio
and/or watermark robustness.

is in qualitative disagreement with simulations of core-collapse supernovae and
will likely produce errors in the yields. But piston-driven explosions are the
most discrepant. Piston-driven explosion severely underestimate the amount of

environment. Due to limited communication bandwidth and other resource
constraints, a critical and practical demand is to online compress data streams
continuously with quality guarantee. Although many data compression and digital
signal processing methods have been developed to reduce data volume, their
super-linear time and more-than-constant space complexity prevents them from
being applied directly on data streams, particularly over resource-constrained
sensor networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of online quality
guaranteed compression of data streams using fast linear approximation (i.e.,
using line segments to approximate a time series). Technically, we address two
versions of the problem which explore quality guarantees in different forms. We
develop online algorithms with linear time complexity and constant cost in
space. Our algorithms are optimal in the sense they generate the minimum number
of segments that approximate a time series with the required quality guarantee.
To meet the resource constraints in sensor networks, we also develop a fast
algorithm which creates connecting segments with very simple computation. The
low cost nature of our methods leads to a unique edge on the applications of
massive and fast streaming environment, low bandwidth networks, and heavily
constrained nodes in computational power. We implement and evaluate our methods
in the application of an acoustic wireless sensor network.

HBT radii of pions and kaons increase with the system initial energy density.
The HBT lifetimes of the pion and kaon sources are sensitive to the initial

density is tuned to the phase boundary between the QGP and mixed phase. This
prolongations of the HBT lifetimes of pions and kaons may likely be observed in

radially outwards and magnetorotational instability (MRI) can occur within a
few hours or days. Viscosity resulting from MRI will readjust the angular

consider the [Co2O6]n chains as giant magnetic moments described by large Ising

well with the experimental results for different sweeping rates. We describe

long-range order at the equilibrium. Such states are further analyzed with

  Our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar
activity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models for
the lightcurves associated with individual quasar events. In the present work
we focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. At all
luminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation function
is fit well by a single power-law in the range 0.5 < r < 20 h^{-1} Mpc, but its
normalization is a strong function of redshift. When we select only quasars
with luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasar
surveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, in
agreement with observations. This holds independently of the assumed lightcurve
model, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the Eddington
limit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few
10^12 h^{-1} M_sun. Therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used
to disentangle lightcurve models, but such a discrimination would become
possible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter
limits.
  Overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree
rather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxy
mergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black
hole accretion and quasar activity.

modern physics. Their theoretical description has drawn much from classical
field equations. These mean-field approximations are in general reliable for
dilute gases in which the atoms collide only rarely with each other, and for
situations where the gas is not too far from thermal equilibrium. With
present-day technology it is, however, possible to drive and observe a system
far away from equilibrium. Functional quantum field theory provides powerful
tools to achieve both, analytical understanding and numerical computability,
also in higher dimensions, of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.
In the article, an outline of these approaches is given, including methods
based on the two-particle irreducible effective action as well as on
renormalisation-group theory. Their relation to near-equilibrium kinetic theory
is discussed, and the distinction between quantum and classical statistical
fluctuations is shown to naturally emerge from the functional-integral
description. Example applications to the evolution of an ultracold atomic Bose

resonant torques with the host halo to satellite heating. A resonant shock
(torque) couples the radial (tangential) motion of a satellite in its orbit to
its phase space. For a satellite on a circular orbit, an ILR-like resonance
dominates the heating and this heating results in continuous satellite mass
loss. We estimate the requirements for simulations to achieve these dynamics
using perturbation theory. Both resonant shocks and resonant torques affect
satellites on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that satellite mass loss is an
outside-in process in energy space; a satellite's stars and gas are thus
protected by their own halo against tidal stripping. We simulate the evolution
of a halo similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in our Galactic dark
matter halo and conclude that the LMC stars have not yet been stripped.
Finally, we present a simple algorithm for estimating the evolution of
satellite mass that includes both shock heating and resonant torques.

gamma-ray burst (GRB) lightcurves is the internal shock model. We propose an
alternative model in which the radiating fluid in the GRB shell is
relativistically turbulent with a typical eddy Lorentz factor $\gamma_t$. In
this model, all pulses in the gamma-ray lightcurve are produced at roughly the
same distance $R$ from the center of the explosion. The burst duration is $\sim
R/c\Gamma^2$, where $\Gamma$ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the expanding shell,
and the duration of individual pulses in the lightcurve is $\sim
R/c\Gamma^2\gamma_t^2$. The model naturally produces highly variable
lightcurves with $\sim\gamma_t^2$ individual pulses. Even though the model
assumes highly inhomogeneous conditions, nevertheless the efficiency for
converting jet energy to radiation is high.

experimental analyses, and focused on the role of a recently discovered small
non-coding RNA, IsrR. We found that IsrR is responsible for a pronounced delay
in the accumulation of isiA mRNA encoding the late-phase stress protein, IsiA,

triggers are removed. These kinetic properties allow the system to selectively
respond to sustained (as opposed to transient) stimuli, and thus establish a
temporal threshold, which prevents energetically costly IsiA accumulation under
short-term stress conditions. Biological information is frequently encoded in
the quantitative aspects of intracellular signals (e.g., amplitude and
duration). Our simulations reveal that competitive inhibition and regulated
degradation allow intracellular regulatory networks to efficiently discriminate

general phenomenological methodology in which the dynamics and structure of
complex systems, characterized by nonlinear interactions, dissipation, and
inertia, are analyzed by extracting information from various signals with
stochastically varying components generated by the systems. The basic idea of
FNS is to treat the correlation links present in sequences of different
irregularities, such as spikes, ""jumps"", and discontinuities in derivatives of
different orders, on all levels of the spatiotemporal hierarchy of the system
under study as main information carriers. The tools to extract and analyze the
information are power spectra and difference moments (structural functions) of
various orders. Presently, FNS can be applied to three types of problems: (1)
determination of parameters or patterns that characterize the dynamics or
structural features of complex systems; (2) finding precursors of abrupt
changes in the state of various complex systems based on a priori information
about the dynamics of the systems; and (3) determination of flow dynamics in
distributed systems based on the analysis of dynamic correlations in stochastic
signals that are simultaneously measured at different points in space. Examples
of FNS applications to such problems as parameterization of the images produced
with atomic force microscopy (AFM), determination of precursors for electric
breakdowns and major earthquakes, and analysis of electric potential
fluctuations in electromembrane systems, as well as to some other problems in
electrochemistry and medicine are discussed.

affecting the conclusions of helioseismological studies. It can change the
direction of the wave propagation, help channeling them straight up to the
corona, extending the dynamic and magnetic couplings between all the layers.
Modern instruments provide measurements of complex patterns of oscillations in
solar active regions and of tiny effects such as temporal oscillations of the
magnetic field. The physics of oscillations in a variety of magnetic structures
of the Sun is similar to that of pulsations of stars that posses strong
magnetic fields, such as roAp stars. All these arguments point toward a need of
systematic self-consistent modeling of waves in magnetic structures that is
able to take into account the complexity of the magnetic field configurations.

A review is given of the overall structure and properties of the Orion star

has given birth to at least ten thousand stars contained in a half dozen
sub-groups and short-lived clusters. The Orion OB association has been the
source of several massive, high-velocity run-away stars, including mu-Columbae

explosions that created the 300 pc diameter Orion / Eridanus super-bubble whose
near wall may be as close as 180 pc. The combined effects of UV radiation,
stellar winds, and supernovae have impacted surviving molecular clouds in
Orion. The large Orion A, IC 2118 molecular clouds and dozens of smaller clouds
strewn throughout the interior of the superbubble have cometary shapes pointing
back towards the center of the Orion OB association. Most are forming stars in

graphene exhibits the half-integer quantum Hall effect. We also fabricated a
55-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR). The conductance of the GNR at the charge

group is linear if its flow is a one parameter group of automorphisms. An
affine vector field is obtained by adding a left invariant one. Its projection
on a homogeneous space, whenever it exists, is still called affine. Affine
vector fields on homogeneous spaces can be characterized by their Lie brackets
with the projections of right invariant vector fields. A linear system on a
homogeneous space is a system whose drift part is affine and whose controlled
part is invariant. The main result is based on a general theorem on finite
dimensional algebras generated by complete vector fields, closely related to a
theorem of Palais, and which have its own interest. The present proof makes use
of geometric control theory arguments.

family of ergodic finite Markov chains to equilibrium. Many natural families of
chains are believed to exhibit cutoff, and yet establishing this fact is often
extremely challenging. An important such family of chains is the random walk on
$\G(n,d)$, a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. It is well known that
almost every such graph for $d\geq 3$ is an expander, and even essentially
Ramanujan, implying a mixing-time of $O(\log n)$. According to a conjecture of
Peres, the simple random walk on $\G(n,d)$ for such $d$ should then exhibit
cutoff with high probability. As a special case of this, Durrett conjectured
that the mixing time of the lazy random walk on a random 3-regular graph is
w.h.p. $(6+o(1))\log_2 n$.
  In this work we confirm the above conjectures, and establish cutoff in
total-variation, its location and its optimal window, both for simple and for
non-backtracking random walks on $\G(n,d)$. Namely, for any fixed $d\geq3$, the
simple random walk on $\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff at $\frac{d}{d-2}\log_{d-1}
n$ with window order $\sqrt{\log n}$. Surprisingly, the non-backtracking random
walk on $\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff already at $\log_{d-1} n$ with constant
window order. We further extend these results to $\G(n,d)$ for any $d=n^{o(1)}$
that grows with $n$ (beyond which the mixing time is O(1)), where we establish
concentration of the mixing time on one of two consecutive integers.

two-dimensional symmetric steady waves travelling on the surface of a deep
ocean beneath a heavy elastic membrane is analyzed as a problem in bifurcation
theory. The behaviour of the two-dimensional cross-section of the membrane is
modelled as a thin (unshearable), heavy, hyperelastic Cosserat rod, following
Antman's elasticity theory, and the fluid beneath is supposed to be in steady
2D irrotational motion under gravity. Assuming that gravity and the density of
the undeformed membrane are prescribed, the free parameters of the problem are
the speed of the wave and drift velocity of the membrane.
  The analysis relies upon a conformal formulation of the hydro-elastic problem
developed in previous papers; the basic tool for the study of the bifurcation
picture is the implicit function theorem, under some non-resonance assumptions.
  The most interesting part of the final result is the existence of a
symmetry-breaking 'third sheet' of solutions, which bifurcates from primary
sheets, and is a hydro-elastic analogue of the phenomenon known as 'Wilton
ripples' in the surface tension case.

into a gas of light atoms in a closed container. In this work we study a 2D
version of this model, where the molecule is a heavy disk of mass M and the gas
is represented by just one point particle of mass m = 1, which interacts with
the disk and the walls of the container via elastic collisions. Chaotic
behavior of the particles is ensured by convex (scattering) walls of the
container. We prove that the position and velocity of the disk, in an
appropriate time scale, converge, as M tends to infinity, to a Brownian motion
(possibly, inhomogeneous); the scaling regime and the structure of the limit
process depend on the initial conditions. Our proofs are based on strong
hyperbolicity of the underlying dynamics, fast decay of correlations in systems
with elastic collisions (billiards), and methods of averaging theory.

  + suppression of a wrong figure (position on the Klein bottle)",,,,"math.CO math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sprouts is a two-player topological game, invented in 1967 by Michael
Paterson and John Conway. The game starts with p spots drawn on a sheet of
paper, and lasts at most 3p-1 moves: the player who makes the last move wins.
  Sprouts is a very intricate game and the best known manual analysis only
achieved to find a winning strategy up to p=7 spots. Recent computer analysis
reached up to p=32.
  The standard game is played on a plane, or equivalently on a sphere. In this
article, we generalize and study the game on any compact surface.
  First, we describe the possible moves on a compact surface, and the way to
implement them in a program. Then, we show that we only need to consider a
finite number of surfaces to analyze the game with p spots on any compact
surface: if we take a surface with a genus greater than some limit genus, then
the game on this surface is equivalent to the game on some smaller surface.
Finally, with computer calculation, we observe that the winning player on
orientable surfaces seems to be always the same one as on a plane, whereas
there are significant differences on non-orientable surfaces.

A closer look near such values reveals that convergence is most likely not at

of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with three gauge-singlet neutrinos
and R-parity violation. The Majorana masses for the gauge-singlet neutrinos as
well as the usual $\mu$-term for the Higgs superfields are generated at the
electroweak scale through the vacuum expectation values of the singlet
sneutrinos. The resulting effective mass matrix for the three light neutrinos
have contributions from the seesaw mechanism involving the singlet neutrinos as
well as due to the mixing with the heavy neutralinos. This model is popularly
known in the literature as the ""$\mu$ from $\nu$ supersymmetric standard model""
($\mu\nu$SSM). We show that even with flavour diagonal neutrino Yukawa
couplings, the global data on three-flavour neutrinos can be well accounted for
in this scenario, at the tree level. We also analyze the mixing in the chargino
and the Higgs sector and calculate the decays of the lightest supersymmetric
particle in this model. The decay branching ratios show certain correlations
with the neutrino mixing angles, which can be tested at the LHC. Some other
phenomenological implications of such a model have been discussed.
