that cold flow gas accretion, particularly along filaments, modifies the
standard picture of gas accretion and cooling onto galaxy disks. In the
standard picture, all gas is initially heated to the virial temperature of the
galaxy as it enters the virial radius. Low mass galaxies are instead dominated
by accretion of gas that stays well below the virial temperature, and even when
a hot halo is able to develop in more massive galaxies there exist dense
filaments that penetrate inside of the virial radius and deliver cold gas to
the central galaxy. For galaxies up to ~L*, this cold accretion gas is
responsible for the star formation in the disk at all times to the present.
Even for galaxies at higher masses, cold flows dominate the growth of the disk
at early times. Within this modified picture, galaxies are able to accrete a
large mass of cold gas, with lower initial gas temperatures leading to shorter
cooling times to reach the disk. Although star formation in the disk is
mitigated by supernovae feedback, the short cooling times allow for the growth
of stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted by the standard model.

obtained UBVRI photometry of the cluster field and low-resolution spectroscopy
of a number of putative members. We derive spectral types from the spectra and
determine that the reddening in this direction is standard. We then carry out a
careful photometric analysis that allows us to determine individual reddening
values, deriving unreddened parameters that are used for the main sequence fit.
We identify 43 likely members of Pismis 11. We study the variation of
extinction across the face of the cluster and find some dispersion, with a
trend to higher values in the immediate neighbourhood of HD 80077. We estimate
a distance of 3.6 kpc for the cluster. If HD 80077 is a member, it has
M_bol<-10.5 and it is one of the three visually brightest stars in the Galaxy.
Several early type stars in the vicinity of Pismis~11 fit well the cluster
sequence and are likely to represent an extended population at the same
distance. About 18 arcmin to the North of Pismis 11, we find a small
concentration of stars, which form a clear sequence. We identify this group as
a previously uncatalogued open cluster, which we provisionally call Alicante 5.
The distance to Alicante 5 is also 3.6 kpc, suggesting that these two clusters
and neighbouring early-type stars form a small association. Based on its proper
motion, HD 80077 is not a runaway star and may be a member of the cluster. If
this is the case, it would be one of the brightest stars in the Galaxy.

is that extra Hall resistance plateaus are expected to emerge when an organized
vacancy superlattice is considered. Secondly, we discuss the anomalous
localization properties we have found for the lowest LL, where an increasing
disorder is shown to enhance the wave functions delocalization (instead of
inducing localization). This unexpected effect is shown to be directly related
to the way disorder increasingly destroys the sublattice (valley) polarization
of the states in the lowest LL. The reason why this anomalous disorder effect
occurs only for the zero-energy LL is that, in absence of disorder, only for
this level all the states are sublattice polarized, i.e., their wave functions
have amplitudes in only one of the sublattices.

dissociation while only about 4% resist to X-rays. Partial ion yields of H+ and

the Rashba and the Dresselhaus interactions (both of arbitrary strengths), can
be suppressed by dint of an in-plane magnetic field. We found a new type of
symmetry, which arises at a particular set of intensity and orientation of the
magnetic field and explains this suppression. Based on our findings, we propose
a transport experiment to measure the strengths of the Rashba and the
Dresselhaus interactions.

an application, we prove that for a left-Gorenstein ring, there exists a
triangle-equivalence between the homotopy category of its Gorenstein projective
modules and the homotopy category of its Gorenstein injective modules, which
restricts to a triangle-equivalence between the homotopy category of projective
modules and the homotopy category of injective modules. In the case of
commutative Gorenstein rings we prove that up to a natural isomorphism our
equivalence extends Iyengar-Krause's equivalence.

  wide-field radio astronomical interferometry","To be published in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14642.x",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive a generalised van Cittert-Zernike (vC-Z) theorem for radio
astronomy that is valid for partially polarized sources over an arbitrarily
wide field-of-view (FoV). The classical vC-Z theorem is the theoretical
foundation of radio astronomical interferometry, and its application is the
basis of interferometric imaging. Existing generalised vC-Z theorems in radio
astronomy assume, however, either paraxiality (narrow FoV) or scalar
(unpolarized) sources. Our theorem uses neither of these assumptions, which are
seldom fulfilled in practice in radio astronomy, and treats the full
electromagnetic field. To handle wide, partially polarized fields, we extend
the two-dimensional electric field (Jones vector) formalism of the standard
""Measurement Equation"" of radio astronomical interferometry to the full
three-dimensional formalism developed in optical coherence theory. The
resulting vC-Z theorem enables all-sky imaging in a single telescope pointing,
and imaging using not only standard dual-polarized interferometers (that
measure 2-D electric fields), but also electric tripoles and electromagnetic
vector-sensor interferometers. We show that the standard 2-D Measurement
Equation is easily obtained from our formalism in the case of dual-polarized
antenna element interferometers. We find, however, that such dual-polarized
interferometers can have polarimetric aberrations at the edges of the FoV that
are often correctable. Our theorem is particularly relevant to proposed and
recently developed wide FoV interferometers such as LOFAR and SKA, for which
direction-dependent effects will be important.

nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258 was observed with Suzaku for ~ 100 ks.
Utilizing the XIS and the HXD, the nucleus emission was detected over 2 to 40
keV range, with an unabsorbed 2--10 keV luminosity of 8 x 10 40 erg / s, and
varied by a factor of ~ 2 during the observation. Its 2--40 keV spectrum is
reproduced by a single power law with photon index of ~ 2.0, absorbed by an
equivalent hydrogen column of ~ 1.0 x 10 23 cm2. The spectrum within 4' of the
nucleus required also a softer thin-thermal emission, as well as an
intermediate hardness component attributable to integrated point sources. A
weak neutral Fe-Kalpha florescence line was detected at an equivalent width of
~ 40 eV. The cold reflection component was not required by the data, with the
reflector solid angle Omega seen from the nucleus constrained as Omega / 2 pi <
0.3 assuming a general case of 60 deg inclination. The results suggest that the
cold reflecting material around the nucleus is localized along our line of
sight, rather than forming a thick torus.

  simplified","Algorithmica 66 (2013), 310-328",,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within a mathematically rigorous model, we analyse the curse of
dimensionality for deterministic exact similarity search in the context of
popular indexing schemes: metric trees. The datasets $X$ are sampled randomly
from a domain $\Omega$, equipped with a distance, $\rho$, and an underlying
probability distribution, $\mu$. While performing an asymptotic analysis, we
send the intrinsic dimension $d$ of $\Omega$ to infinity, and assume that the
size of a dataset, $n$, grows superpolynomially yet subexponentially in $d$.
Exact similarity search refers to finding the nearest neighbour in the dataset
$X$ to a query point $\omega\in\Omega$, where the query points are subject to
the same probability distribution $\mu$ as datapoints. Let $\mathscr F$ denote
a class of all 1-Lipschitz functions on $\Omega$ that can be used as decision
functions in constructing a hierarchical metric tree indexing scheme. Suppose
the VC dimension of the class of all sets $\{\omega\colon f(\omega)\geq a\}$,
$a\in\R$ is $o(n^{1/4}/\log^2n)$. (In view of a 1995 result of Goldberg and
Jerrum, even a stronger complexity assumption $d^{O(1)}$ is reasonable.) We
deduce the $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ lower bound on the expected average case
performance of hierarchical metric-tree based indexing schemes for exact
similarity search in $(\Omega,X)$. In paricular, this bound is superpolynomial
in $d$.
