the deceleration radius ($\sim10^{17}$ cm) by a turbulent source with random
Lorentz factors $\sim10$ in the comoving frame. The optical radiation was
produced by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, and the
gamma-rays by inverse Compton scattering of the synchrotron photons. The
gamma-ray emission originated both in eddies and in an inter-eddy medium,
whereas the optical radiation was mostly from the latter. Therefore, the
gamma-ray emission was highly variable whereas the optical was much less
variable. The model explains all the observed features in the prompt optical

whether the energy of the explosion was carried outward primarily by particles

new tools for investigating resolved stellar populations. The WFC3 Galactic
Bulge Treasury program will obtain deep imaging on 4 low-extinction fields.
These non-proprietary data will enable a variety of science investigations not
possible with previous data sets. To aid in planning for the use of these data
and for future proposals, we provide an introduction to the program, its
photometric system, and the associated calibration effort.
  The observing strategy is based upon a new 5-band photometric system spanning
the UV, optical, and near-infrared. With these broad bands, one can construct
reddening-free indices of Teff and [Fe/H]. Besides the 4 bulge fields, the
program will target 6 fields in well-studied star clusters, spanning a wide
range of [Fe/H]. The cluster data serve to calibrate the indices, provide
population templates, and correct the transformation of isochrones into the
WFC3 photometric system. The bulge data will shed light on the bulge formation
history, and will also serve as population templates for other studies. One of
the fields includes 12 candidate hosts of extrasolar planets.
  CMDs are the most popular tool for analyzing resolved stellar populations.
However, due to degeneracies among Teff, [Fe/H], and reddening in traditional
CMDs, it can be difficult to draw robust conclusions from the data. The 5-band
system used for the bulge Treasury observations will provide indices that are
roughly orthogonal in Teff and [Fe/H], and we argue that model fitting in an
index-index diagram will make better use of the information than fitting
separate CMDs. We provide simulations to show the expected data quality and the
potential for differentiating between different star-formation histories.

gravitational-wave field that is sourced by the gravitational-wave
stress-energy tensor. For quasicircular, inspiralling binaries, the
Christodoulou memory produces a growing, nonoscillatory change in the
gravitational-wave ""plus"" polarization, resulting in the permanent displacement
of a pair of freely-falling test masses after the wave has passed. In addition
to its nonoscillatory behavior, the Christodoulou memory is interesting because
even though it originates from 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order multipole
interactions, it affects the waveform at leading (Newtonian/quadrupole) order.
The memory is also potentially detectable in binary black-hole mergers. While
the oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for
quasicircular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order,
the memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to
leading order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown
to vanish). Here the calculation of the memory for quasicircular, inspiralling
binaries is extended to 3PN order. While the angular dependence of the memory
remains qualitatively unchanged, the PN correction terms tend to reduce the
memory's magnitude. Explicit expressions are given for the memory contributions
to the plus polarization and the spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes of the
metric and curvature perturbations. Combined with the recent results of
Blanchet et al.(2008), this completes the waveform to 3PN order. This paper
also discusses: (i) the difficulties in extracting the memory from numerical
simulations, (ii) other nonoscillatory effects that enter the waveform at high
PN orders, and (iii) issues concerning the observability of the memory.

been sparsely observed until recently when the Fermi satellite was launched. If
>TeV gamma rays are produced in GRBs and can escape from the emission region,
they are attenuated by the cosmic infrared background photons, leading to
regeneration of GeV-TeV secondary photons via inverse-Compton scattering. This
secondary emission can last for a longer time than the duration of GRBs, and it
is called a pair echo. We investigate how this pair echo emission affects
spectra and light curves of high energy afterglows, considering not only prompt
emission but also afterglow as the primary emission. Detection of pair echoes
is possible as long as the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in voids is
weak. We find (1) that the pair echo from the primary afterglow emission can
affect the observed high-energy emission in the afterglow phase after the jet
break, and (2) that the pair echo from the primary prompt emission can also be
relevant, but only when significant energy is emitted in the TeV range,
typically E_{gamma, >0.1 TeV} > (Y/(1+Y)) epsilon_e E_k. Even non-detections of
the pair echoes could place interesting constraints on the strength of IGMF.
The more favorable targets to detect pair echoes may be the ""naked"" GRBs
without conventional afterglow emission, although energetic naked GRBs would be
rare. If the IGMF is weak enough, it is predicted that the GeV emission extends
to >30-300 s.

applicable to donor impurity atoms in semiconductor physics, where the
conduction band corresponds to the vacuum, and the loosely bound electron
orbiting a singly charged core has a hydrogen-like spectrum according to the
usual Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, shifted to the far-infrared due to the small
effective mass and high dielectric constant. Manipulation of Rydberg states in
free atoms and ions by single and multi-photon processes has been tremendously
productive since the development of pulsed visible laser spectroscopy. The
analogous manipulations have not been conducted for donor impurities in
silicon. Here we use the FELIX pulsed free electron laser to perform
time-domain measurements of the Rydberg state dynamics in phosphorus- and
arsenic-doped silicon and we have obtained lifetimes consistent with frequency
domain linewidths for isotopically purified silicon. This implies that the
dominant decoherence mechanism for excited Rydberg states is lifetime
broadening, just as for atoms in ion traps. The experiments are important
because they represent the first step towards coherent control and manipulation
of atomic-like quantum levels in the most common semiconductor and complement
magnetic resonance experiments in the literature, which show extraordinarily
long spin lattice relaxation times key to many well-known schemes for quantum
computing qubits for the same impurities. Our results, taken together with the
magnetic resonance data and progress in precise placement of single impurities,

the fixed surface is equal to the average of the magnetic fluxes through the
ensemble of surfaces at earlier times. This result is an analogue of the
well-known Alfven theorem of ideal MHD and is valid for any value of the
magnetic Prandtl number. A second stochastic conservation law is shown to hold
at unit Prandtl number, a random version of the generalized Kelvin theorem

  First, it formulates a model for the self-processing of information about the
cellular tissue state and cooperative interaction of blood vessels governing
redistribution of blood flow over the vascular network. Mass conservation
(conservation of blood flow as well as transported biochemical compounds) plays
the key role in implementing these processes. The vascular network is
considered to be of the tree form and the blood vessels are assumed to respond
individually to an activator in blood flowing though them.
  Second, the constructed governing equations are analyzed numerically. It is
shown that at the first approximation the blood perfusion rate depends locally
on the activator concentration in the cellular tissue, which is due to the
hierarchical structure of the vascular network. Then the distinction between
the reaction threshold of individual vessels and that of the vascular network
as a whole is demonstrated. In addition, the nonlocal component of the
dependence of the blood perfusion rate on the activator concentration is found
to change its form as the activator concentration increases.

evidences show that microwave-induced resistance oscillations and zero
resistance states are differently affected depending on the experimental
set-up: two magnetic fields (two-axis magnet) or one tilted magnetic field. In
the first case, experiments report a clear quenching of resistance oscillations
and zero resistance states. In a tilted field, one obtains oscillations
displacement and quenching but the latter is unbalanced and less intense. In
our theoretical proposal we explain these results in terms of the
microwave-driven harmonic motion performed by the electronic orbits and how
this motion is increasingly damped by the in-plane field.

inhibitor of malignant transformation by degrading insulin and thus preventing
this major growth-stimulatory hormone from binding and thereby inactivating the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). Ten years later, I discovered
that a carboxyterminal RB amino acid sequence resembles the catalytic center of
IDE. This structural homology raised the possibility that insulin degradation
is a basic mechanism for tumor suppression shared by RB and IDE. Subsequently,
a first immunohistochemical study on the differential expression of human IDE
in normal tissues, primary tumors and their corresponding lymph node metastases
further corroborated the initial conjecture on IDE being an antineoplastic
molecule. In this report, it is shown that IDE harbors ankyrin repeat-like
amino acid sequences through which it might bind and, as a result, antagonize
the pro-inflammatory factor NF-kappaB as well as cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs). As equally revealed here, IDE also contains 2 RXL cyclin-binding motifs
which could contribute to its presumed inhibition of CDKs. These new findings
suggest that IDE is potentially able to suppress both inflammation and
oncogenesis by several mechanisms that ultimately ensure RB function.

the new geometry is spectral in agreement with the physical way of measuring
distances. In this paper we present a detailed introduction with an overview on
the study of the quantum nature of space-time using the tools of noncommutative
geometry. In particular we examine the suitability of using the spectral action
as action functional for the theory. To demonstrate how the spectral action
encodes the dynamics of gravity we examine the accuracy of the approximation of
the spectral action by its asymptotic expansion in the case of the round three
sphere. We find that the two terms corresponding to the cosmological constant
and the scalar curvature term already give the full result with remarkable
accuracy. This is then applied to the physically relevant case of the product
of the three sphere by a circle where we show that the spectral action in this
case is also given, for any test function, by the sum of two terms up to an
astronomically small correction, and in particular all higher order terms
vanish. This result is confirmed by evaluating the spectral action using the
heat kernel expansion where we check that the higher order terms a4 and a6 both
vanish due to remarkable cancelations. We also show that the Higgs potential
appears as an exact perturbation when the test function used is a smooth cutoff
function.

problem of finite-density QCD, and the problem of confinement. It is proven
that the effective action for heavy quarks at finite density is PT-symmetric.
For the case of 1+1 dimensions, the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian, although not
Hermitian, has real eigenvalues for a range of values of the chemical potential
$\mu$, solving the sign problem for this model. The effective action for heavy
quarks is part of a potentially large class of generalized sine-Gordon models
which are non-Hermitian but are PT-symmetric. Generalized sine-Gordon models
also occur naturally in gauge theories in which magnetic monopoles lead to
confinement. We explore gauge theories where monopoles cause confinement at
arbitrarily high temperatures. Several different classes of monopole gases
exist, with each class leading to different string tension scaling laws. For
one class of monopole gas models, the PT-symmetric affine Toda field theory
emerges naturally as the effective theory. This in turn leads to sine-law
scaling for string tensions, a behavior consistent with lattice simulations.

in the CO(1-0) emission shows that the molecular gas rotates like the thicker

thinner disc was formed by a major gas accretion event. However, a simulation
shows that the gas rotating like the thicker disc naturally results from the

feasibility of this scenario for the formation of NGC 4550. We investigate
various star formation tracers to determine whether the molecular gas in NGC

cutoff. Thus, the assumption that statistics of relevant high energy
excitations is neither Bose nor Fermi but infinite can remove the hierarchy

by diffusion. Here we incorporate a highly simplified anisotropic transport
mechanism in order to model the net effect of flux conveyance by magnetic
pumping and by magnetic buoyancy. We investigate the influence of this
mechanism on the efficiency of kinematic dynamo action. It is found that the
effect of flux transport on the efficiency of the dynamo is dependent upon the
spatial profile of the transport. Typically, transport hinders the onset of
dynamo action and increases the frequency of the dynamo waves. However, in
certain cases there exists a preferred magnitude of transport for which dynamo
action is most efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the
imposition of boundary conditions in drawing conclusions on the role of
transport.

this is non-trivial, because we should not and do not assume that Birkhoff's

agreement: When normalized to have the same fluctuations at early times, weaker

true for models that are normalized to have the same linear theory power
spectrum today, so the abundance of rich clusters potentially places
interesting constraints on such models. Our analysis also indicates that the
formation histories and abundances of sufficiently low mass objects are
unchanged from standard gravity. This explains why simulations have found that
the nonlinear power-spectrum at large k is unaffected by such modifications to
the gravitational potential. In addition, the most massive objects in
CMB-normalized models with weaker gravity are expected to be similar to the
high-redshift progenitors of the most massive objects in models with stronger

emission signals in an effort to understand the origin of intermittent peeling
of an adhesive tape and its connection to acoustic emission. The model
represents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation
functional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of
the peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,
rugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,
the ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the
dissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations
are reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We
show that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force
function, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the
peel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a
fully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter
values suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.
To verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of
experimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction
velocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics
within a subinterval of pull speeds within the intermittent regime. Time series
analysis of the model acoustic energy signals is also found to be chaotic

extended interactions that retain the EHM symmetry are shown to have a less

matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is used to obtain $E_m$ directly as the

  physics","PhD Thesis",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The descriptions of the quantum realm and the macroscopic classical world
differ significantly not only in their mathematical formulations but also in
their foundational concepts and philosophical consequences. When and how
physical systems stop to behave quantum mechanically and begin to behave
classically is still heavily debated in the physics community and subject to
theoretical and experimental research.
  This dissertation puts forward an approach to the quantum-to-classical
transition fully within quantum theory and conceptually different from already
existing models: It neither needs to refer to the uncontrollable environment of
a system (decoherence) nor to change the quantum laws itself (collapse models),
but puts the stress on the limits of observability of quantum phenomena due to
the imprecision of our measurement apparatuses. For a certain class of time
evolutions it is this mere restriction to coarse-grained measurements which is
sufficient to see the natural emergence of macroscopic realism and even the
classical Newtonian laws out of the full quantum formalism. But there also
exist ""non-classical"" Hamiltonians for which a classical spatiotemporal
description of the system's time evolution remains impossible even under fuzzy
measurements or decoherence. It is argued that such Hamiltonians are unlikely
to be spontaneously realized in nature because of their high complexity.
  The last part addresses the question of the origin of quantum randomness and
proposes a link with mathematical undecidability.

in-medium interaction on both sides of the Boltzmann equation, namely in the
calculation of the mean field and in the calculation of the collision rate.
This allows us to explain the observed upward shift of the frequency of the
quadrupole mode in the collisionless regime. By including the mean field, we
also improve considerably the agreement with the measured temperature
dependence of frequency and damping rate of the scissors mode, whereas the use
of the in-medium cross section deteriorates the description, in agreement with

to capture essential features of the time-irreversible nature of decoherence
and the quantum measurement process, as well as macro-physical behaviour and
the development of emergent complex systems, including life, which exist in the
real universe. When these are taken into account, the unchanging block universe
view of spacetime is best replaced by an evolving block universe which extends
as time evolves, with the potential of the future continually becoming the
certainty of the past; spacetime itself evolves, as do the entities within it.
However this time evolution is not related to any preferred surfaces in
spacetime; rather it is associated with the evolution of proper time along
families of world lines. The default state of fundamental physics should not be
taken to be a time irreversible evolution of physical states: it is an ongoing
irreversible development of time itself.

mechanical luminosity of the wind does not exceed the radiative luminosity at
its base. This upper bound on the mass loss rate is known as the photon-tiring
limit. Once above this limit, the radiation field is unable to lift all the
material out of the gravitational potential of the star, such that only part of
it can escape and reach infinity. The rest stalls and falls back toward the
stellar surface, making a steady-state wind impossible. Photon-tiring is not an
issue for line-driven winds since they cannot achieve sufficiently high mass
loss rates. It can however become important if the star exceeds the Eddington
limit and continuum interaction becomes the dominant driving mechanism.
  This paper investigates the time-dependent behaviour of stellar winds that
exceed the photon-tiring limit, using 1-D numerical simulations of a porosity
moderated, continuum-driven stellar wind. We find that the regions close to the
star show a hierarchical pattern of high density shells moving back and forth,
unable to escape the gravitational potential of the star. At larger distances,
the flow eventually becomes uniformly outward, though still quite variable.
Typically, these winds have a very high density but a terminal flow speed well
below the escape speed at the stellar surface. Since most of the radiative
luminosity of the star is used to drive the stellar wind, such stars would
appear much dimmer than expected from the super-Eddington energy generation at
their core. The visible luminosity typically constitutes less then half of the
total energy flow and can become as low as ten percent or less for those stars
that exceed the photon-tiring limit by a large margin.

the Hbeta spectral region of these very luminous quasars. We find two major
trends: (1) a systematic increase of minimum FWHM Hbeta with luminosity
(discussed in a previous paper). This lower FWHM envelope is best fit assuming
that the narrowest sources radiate near the Eddington limit, show line emission
from a virialized cloud distribution, and obey a well defined broad line region
size vs. luminosity relation. (2) A systematic decrease of equivalent width of
[OIII] (from W ~ 15 to ~ 1 A) with increasing source bolometric luminosity
(from log L ~ 43 to log L ~ 49). Further identified trends required
discrimination between so-called Population A and B sources. We generate median
composite spectra in six luminosity bins Pop. A sources show reasonably
symmetric Lorentzian Hbeta profiles at all luminosities while Pop. B sources
require two component fits involving an unshifted broad and a redshifted very
broad component. Very broad Hbeta increases in strength with increasing L while
the broad component remains constant resulting in an apparent ""Baldwin effect""
with equivalent width decreasing from W ~ 80 to ~ 20 A over our sample
luminosity range. The roughly constant equivalent width shown by the Hbeta very
broad component implies production in optically-thick, photoionized gas. The
onset of the redshifted very broad component appears to be a critical change
that occurs near the Pop. A-B boundary at FWHM Hbeta ~ 4000 km/s which we
relate to a critical Eddington ratio (~ 0.2 +/- 0.1).

Bradfordizing for information retrieval (IR) experiments. Bradfordizing is used
for generating core document sets for subject-specific questions and to reorder
result sets from distributed searches. The method will be applied and tested in
a controlled scenario of scientific literature databases from social and
political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science (SOLIS, SoLit,
USB Koeln Opac, CSA Sociological Abstracts, World Affairs Online, Psyndex and
Medline) and 164 standardized topics. An evaluation of the method and its
effects is carried out in two laboratory-based information retrieval
experiments (CLEF and KoMoHe) using a controlled document corpus and human
relevance assessments. The results show that Bradfordizing is a very robust
method for re-ranking the main document types (journal articles and monographs)
in today's digital libraries (DL). The IR tests show that relevance
distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if articles in
the core are compared with articles in the succeeding zones. The items in the
core are significantly more often assessed as relevant, than items in zone 2
(z2) or zone 3 (z3). The improvements between the zones are statistically
significant based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired T-Test.

suppression patterns of heavy-flavored single inclusive hadron spectra at high

characterization of the medium produced in the collision. In this note, we
point out that the capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic
projectile is an independent signature, which may differ for different media at
the same density. In particular, while the mass hierarchy (i.e., the projectile
mass dependence) of radiative energy loss depends solely on a property of the
projectile, the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss depends significantly
on properties of the medium. By varying these properties in a class of models,
we find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be
modified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative
parton energy loss. This may help to disentangle the relative strengths of
radiative and collisional contributions to jet quenching, and it may be
employed to constrain properties of the produced QCD medium beyond its density.

Cosmology (LQC) of the flat isotropic model with a massless scalar field in the
absence of higher order curvature corrections to the gravitational part of the
Hamiltonian constraint. The matter part of the constraint contains the inverse
triad operator which can be quantized with or without the use of a Thiemann-
like procedure. With the latter choice, we show that the LQC quantization is
identical to that of the standard Wheeler DeWitt theory (WDW) wherein there is
no singularity resolution. We argue that the former choice leads to singularity
resolution in the sense of a well defined, regular (backward) evolution through
and beyond the epoch where the size of the universe vanishes.
  Our work along with that of the seminal work of Ashtekar, Pawlowski and Singh

structures in this LQC model, namely: curvature corrections, inverse triad
definitions and the `polymer' nature of the kinematic representation. We also

Estimated cellular volumes matched to medium-sized bacteria and small

proposed a plasmon-like model of hydrogen-oxygen ionic plasma in liquid water.

present a XMM-Newton observation of the HAeBe HD 163296. We analyse the light
curve, the broad band and the grating spectra, fit emission measures and
abundances and apply models for accretion and wind shocks. We find three
temperature components ranging from 0.2 keV to 2.7 keV. The O VII He-like
triplet indicates a X-ray formation region in a low density environment with a
weak UV photon field, i. e. above the stellar surface. This makes an origin in
an accretion shock unlikely, instead we suggest a shock at the base of the jet
for the soft component and a coronal origin for the hot component. A mass
outflow of 10^{-10} solar masses per year is sufficient to power the soft
X-rays. HD 163296 is thought to be single, so this data represent genuine HAeBe
X-ray emission. HD 163296 might be prototypical for its class.

phase-space structure of dark matter in N-body cosmological simulations is
presented. The algorithm depends mainly on two parameters, which control the
level of connectivity of the detected structures and their significance
compared to Poisson noise. By working in 6D phase-space, where contrasts are
much more pronounced than in 3D position space, our HSF algorithm is capable of
detecting subhaloes including their tidal tails, and can recognise other
phase-space structures such as pure streams and candidate caustics. If an
additional unbinding criterion is added, the algorithm can be used as a
self-consistent halo and subhalo finder. As a test, we apply it to a large halo
of the Millennium Simulation, where 19 % of the halo mass are found to belong
to bound substructures, which is more than what is detected with conventional
3D substructure finders, and an additional 23-36 % of the total mass belongs to
unbound HSF structures. The distribution of identified phase-space density
peaks is clearly bimodal: high peaks are dominated by the bound structures and
low peaks belong mostly to tidal streams. In order to better understand what
HSF provides, we examine the time evolution of structures, based on the merger
tree history. Bound structures typically make only up to 6 orbits inside the
main halo. Still, HSF can identify at the present time at least 80 % of the
original content of structures with a redshift of infall as high as z <= 0.3,
which illustrates the significant power of this tool to perform dynamical
analyses in phase-space.

be shown that driven MHD waves in magnetic plasmas with high Reynolds number
exhibit a near resonant behaviour if the frequency of the wave becomes equal to
the local Alfven (or slow) frequency of a magnetic surface. This near resonant
behaviour is confined to a thin region, known as the dissipative layer, which
embraces the resonant magnetic surface. Although driven MHD waves have small
dimensionless amplitude far away from the resonant surface, this near-resonant

aim is to study the nonlinear effects in the Alfven dissipative layer. In the
present paper, the method of simplified matched asymptotic expansions developed
for nonlinear slow resonant waves is used to describe nonlinear effects inside
the Alfven dissipative layer. The nonlinear corrections to resonant waves in

described by the linear theory with great accuracy.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:200810437",,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the temporal evolution of temperature, emission
measure, energy loss and velocity in a C-class solar flare from both an
observational and theoretical perspective. The properties of the flare were
derived by following the systematic cooling of the plasma through the response
functions of a number of instruments -- RHESSI (>5 MK), GOES-12 (5-30 MK),
TRACE 171 A (1 MK) and SOHO/CDS (~0.03-8 MK). These measurements were studied
in combination with simulations from the 0-D EBTEL model. At the flare on-set,
upflows of ~90 km s-1 and low level emission were observed in Fe XIX,
consistent with pre-flare heating and gentle chromospheric evaporation. During
the impulsive phase, upflows of ~80 km s-1 in Fe XIX and simultaneous downflows
of 20 km s-1 in He I and O V were observed, indicating explosive chromospheric
evaporation. The plasma was subsequently found to reach a peak temperature of
~13 MK in approximately 10 minutes. Using EBTEL, conduction was found to be the
dominant loss mechanism during the initial ~300s of the decay phase. It was
also found to be responsible for driving gentle chromospheric evaporation
during this period. As the temperature fell below ~8 MK, and for the next
~4,000s, radiative losses were determined to dominate over conductive losses.
The radiative loss phase was accompanied by significant downflows of <40 km s-1
in O V. This is the first extensive study of the evolution of a canonical solar
flare using both spectroscopic and broad-band instruments in conjunction with a
hydrodynamic model. While our results are in broad agreement with the standard
flare model, the simulations suggest that both conductive and non-thermal beam
heating play important roles in heating the flare plasma during the impulsive
phase of at least this event.

as a open, bounded and contractible subset of the complex Banach space of
bounded quadratic differentials for $G$. It utilizes the schlicht model of
Teichm\""uller space, where each point is represented by an injective
holomorphic function on the disc, and the map is constructed via the Schwarzian
differential operator.
  In this paper we prove that a certain class of differential operators acting
on functions of the disc induce holomorphic mappings of Teichm\""uller spaces,
and we also obtain a general formula for the differential of the induced
mappings at the origin. The main focus of this work, however, is on two
particular series of such mappings, dubbed higher Bers maps, because they are
induced by so-called higher Schwarzians -- generalizations of the classical
Schwarzian operator. For these maps, we prove several further results.
  The last section contains a discussion of possible applications, open
questions and speculations.
