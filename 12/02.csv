decomposition provides three independent (q^2 dependent) observables. A
strategy was formulated to extract all measurable Wilson coefficients in B ->
Xs l+ l- from a few simple integrals of these observables in the low q^2
region. The experimental measurements in the low q^2 region require a cut on
the hadronic invariant mass, which introduces a dependence on nonperturbative b
quark distribution functions. The associated hadronic uncertainties could
potentially limit the sensitivity of these decays to new physics. We compute
the nonperturbative corrections to all three observables at leading and
subleading order in the power expansion in \Lambda_QCD/m_b. We find that the
subleading power corrections give sizeable corrections, of order -5% to -10%
depending on the observable and the precise value of the hadronic mass cut.
They cause a shift of order -0.05 GeV^2 to -0.1 GeV^2 in the zero of the
forward-backward asymmetry.

system (Marois et al. 2008), where the masses of the planets have been
estimated by untested cooling models. We point out that the nominal circular,
face-on orbits of the planets lead to a dynamical instability in ~10^5 yr, a
factor of at least 100 shorter than the estimated age of the star. Reduced
planetary masses produce stability only for unreasonably small planets (<~2 M_
Jup). Relaxing the face-on assumption, but still requiring circular orbits
while fitting the observed positions, makes the instability time even shorter.
A promising solution is that the inner two planets have a 2:1 commensurability
between their periods, and they avoid close encounters with each other through
this resonance. That the inner resonance has lasted until now, in spite of the
perturbations of the outer planet, leads to a limit <~10 M_Jup on the masses
unless the outer two planets are also engaged in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance.
In a double resonance, which is consistent with the current data, the system
could survive until now even if the planets have masses of ~20 M_Jup. Apsidal
alignment can further enhance the stability of a mean-motion resonant system. A
completely different dynamical configuration, with large eccentricities and
large mutual inclinations among the planets, is possible but finely tuned.

dark energy for the observed acceleration of the universe. We calculate
quasilinear effects in the growth of structure in f(R) models of gravity using
perturbation theory. We find significant deviations in the bispectrum that
depend on cosmic time, length scale and triangle shape. However the deviations
in the reduced bispectrum Q for f(R) models are at the percent level, much
smaller than the deviations in the bispectrum itself. This implies that
three-point correlations can be predicted to a good approximation simply by
using the modified linear growth factor in the standard gravity formalism. Our
results suggest that gravitational clustering in the weakly nonlinear regime is
not fundamentally altered, at least for a class of gravity theories that are
well described in the Newtonian regime by the parameters G_eff and Phi/Psi.
This approximate universality was also seen in the N-body simulation
measurements of the power spectrum by Stabenau and Jain (2006), and in other
recent studies based on simulations. Thus predictions for such modified gravity
models in the regime relevant to large-scale structure observations may be less
daunting than expected on first principles. We discuss the caveats that apply

chain of the magnetic atoms with nuclear spins 1/2 substituting the basic atoms
in the plate of nuclear spin free easy-axis 3D antiferromagnet is considered.
It is formulated the generalized antiferromagnet Hamiltonian in spin-wave
approximation (low temperatures) considering the inhomogeneous external
magnetic field, which is directed along the easy axis normally to plane of the
plate and has a constant gradient along the nuclear spin chain. Assuming a weak
gradient, the asymptotic expression for coefficients of unitary transformations
to the diagonal form of antiferromagnet Hamiltonian is found. With this result
the expression for indirect interspin coupling, which is due to hyperfine
nuclear electron coupling in atoms and the virtual spin wave propagation in
antiferromagnet ground state, was evaluated.
  It is shown that the inhomogeneous magnetic field essentially modifies the
characteristics of indirect interspin coupling. The indirect interaction
essentially grows and even oscillates in relation to the interspin distance
when the local field value in the middle point of two considered nuclear spin
is close to the critical field for quantum phase transition of spin-flop type
in bulk antiferromagnet or close to antiferromagnetic resonance. Thus, the
external magnetic field, its gradient, microwave frequency and power can play
the role of control parameters for qubit states.
  Finally, the one and two qubit states decoherence and longitudinal relaxation
rate are caused by the interaction of nuclear spins with virtual spin waves in
antiferromagnet ground state are calculated.

  http://www.chnosz.net/yeast",,,,"q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [abridged] Background: The distribution of chemical species in an open system
at metastable equilibrium can be expressed as a function of environmental
variables which can include temperature, oxidation-reduction potential and
others. Calculations of metastable equilibrium for various model systems were
used to characterize chemical transformations among proteins and groups of
proteins found in different compartments of yeast cells.
  Results: With increasing oxygen fugacity, the relative metastability fields
of model proteins for major subcellular compartments go as mitochondrion,
endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, nucleus. In a metastable equilibrium setting
at relatively high oxygen fugacity, proteins making up actin are predominant,
but those constituting the microtubule occur with a low chemical activity. A
reaction sequence involving the microtubule and spindle pole proteins was
predicted by combining the known intercompartmental interactions with a
hypothetical program of oxygen fugacity changes in the local environment. In
further calculations, the most-abundant proteins within compartments generally
occur in relative abundances that only weakly correspond to a metastable
equilibrium distribution. However, physiological populations of proteins that
form complexes often show an overall positive or negative correlation with the
relative abundances of proteins in metastable assemblages.
  Conclusions: This study explored the outlines of a thermodynamic description
of chemical transformations among interacting proteins in yeast cells. The
results suggest that these methods can be used to measure the degree of
departure of a natural biochemical process or population from a local minimum
in Gibbs energy.

star's frequency and sometimes twice that, due to the presence of two funnel
streams that produce antipodal hotspots near the magnetic poles. On the other
hand, lightcurves during unstable accretion through tongues penetrating the
magnetosphere are more chaotic due to the stochastic behaviour of the tongues,
and produce noisier power spectra. However, the power spectra do show some
signs of quasi-periodic variability. Most importantly, the rotation frequency
of the tongues and the resulting hotspots is close to the inner-disk orbital
frequency, except in the most strongly unstable cases. There is therefore a
high probability of observing QPOs at that frequency in longer simulations. In
addition, the lightcurves in the unstable regime show periodicity at the star's
rotation frequency in many of the cases investigated here, again except in the
most strongly unstable cases which lack funnel flows and the resulting
antipodal hotspots. The noisier power spectra result in the fractional rms
amplitudes of the Fourier peaks being smaller.

rotation and magnetic axes of the star on the variability, and find that at
misalignment angles $\gtrsim 25^\circ$, the star's period always appears in the

in the energy range around the so-called knee. The data of KASCADE have been
used in a composition analysis showing the knee at 3-5 PeV to be caused by a
steepening in the light-element spectra. Since the applied unfolding analysis
depends crucially on simulations of air showers, different high energy hadronic
interaction models (QGSJet and SIBYLL) were used. The results have shown a
strong dependence of the relative abundance of the individual mass groups on
the underlying model. In this update of the analysis we apply the unfolding
method with a different low energy interaction model (FLUKA instead of GHEISHA)
in the simulations. While the resulting individual mass group spectra do not
change significantly, the overall description of the measured data improves by
using the FLUKA model. In addition data in a larger range of zenith angle are
analysed. The new results are completely consistent, i.e. there is no hint to
any severe problem in applying the unfolding analysis method to KASCADE data.

form factor in the region Q^2 \le 20 GeV^2. To probe the accuracy of
local-duality sum rules for form factors, we apply precisely the same
procedures to extract the form factor in a quantum-mechanical potential model.
Comparison of the exact form factor known in this model with the result of the
sum-rule calculation gives a probe of the systematic error of the method. In
our example this error is found to be at the level of 10-20%. We expect similar

to the ageing (i.e. gradual deterioration) of the constituent networks. A
stable environment develops cooperation leading to over-optimization, and
forming an ""always-old"" network, which accumulates damage, and dies in an
apoptosis-like process. A rapidly changing environment develops competition
forming a ""forever-young"" network, which may suffer an occasional
over-perturbation exhausting system-resources, and causing death in a
necrosis-like process. Giving a number of examples we demonstrate how
cooperation evokes the gradual accumulation of damage typical to ageing.
Finally, we show how various forms of cooperation and consequent ageing emerge
as key elements in all major steps of evolution from the formation of
protocells to the establishment of the globalized, modern human society.

Infra-red excesses of stars were used to measure total mass-loss rates for

stars - V6 and V42 - for which we present new Gemini/T-ReCS mid-infrared
spectroscopy, possibly showing that V42 has carbon-rich dust. The cluster's
dust temperatures are found to be typically >~550 K. Mass loss apparently does
not vary significantly with metallicity within the cluster, but shows some
correlation with barium enhancement, which appears to occur in cooler stars,
and especially on the anomalous RGB. Limits to outflow velocities, dust-to-gas
ratios for the dusty objects and the possibility of short-timescale mass-loss
variability are also discussed in the context of mass loss from low-metallicity
stars. The ubiquity of dust around stars near the RGB-tip suggests significant
dusty mass loss on the RGB; we estimate that typically 0.20--0.25 Msun of mass
loss occurs on the RGB. From observational limits on intra-cluster material, we
suggest the dust is being cleared on a timescale of <~10^5 years.

described by coarse grained (CG) models, where either the whole molecule

(in the case of alkanes) are lumped into an effective point particle.
Interactions among these point particles are fitted by Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potentials such that the vapor-liquid critical point of the fluid is reproduced
in agreement with experiment; in the case of quadrupolar molecules a
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is included. These models are shown to
provide a satisfactory description of the liquid-vapour phase diagram of these
pure fluids. Investigations of mixtures, using the Lorentz-Berthelot (LB)
combining rule, also produce satisfactory results if compared with experiment,
while in some previous attempts (in which polar solvents were modelled without
explicitly taking into account quadrupolar interaction), strong violations of
the LB rules were required. For this reason, the present investigation is a
step towards predictive modelling of polar mixtures at low computational cost.
These very simple coarse-grained models of small molecules developed here
should be useful e.g. for simulations of polymer solutions with such molecules

the eigenstates belong to the irreducible representations of the SU(N) group

low-lying states are, for l not too small, very close to those of the

to be typically of O(1) in appropriate units, much as one would expect if the
bosonic string model were an effective string theory for the dynamics of these

where such corrections have been found to be unnaturally small. Moreover we
find that these corrections appear to be particularly small when the `phonons'
along the string have the same momentum, and large when their momentum is
opposite. This provides information about the detailed nature of the
interactions in the effective string theory. We have searched for, but not
found, extra states that would arise from the excitation of the massive modes

non-conservative mechanical systems by starting with a first variation
functional, instead of an action functional, and finding their zeroes. The
kernel of the first variation functional, as an integral functional, is a
1-form on the manifold of kinematical states, which then represents the
dynamical state of the system. If the 1-form is exact then the first variation
functional is associated with the first variation of an action functional in
the usual manner. The dynamical equations then follow from the vanishing of the
dual of the Spencer operator that acts on the dynamical state. This operator,
in turn, relates to the integrability of the kinematical states. The method is
applied to the modeling of damped oscillators.

and have been subject of research for many decades. Two main schemes have been
proposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by
a linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct
light-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an
external field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence
of axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature
would cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the
presence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of
the light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project
sensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has
opened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED
corrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low
energies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence
measurements and index of refraction measurements. We propose an almost
parasitic implementation of an external magnetic field along the arms of the
VIRGO interferometer and discuss the advantage of this choice in comparison to
a previously proposed configuration based on shorter prototype interferometers

a thin and a thick radio disk with exponential scaleheights of 0.3 kpc and 1.7
kpc at lambda 6.2 cm. The equipartition total magnetic field strength between 7
micro G and 18 micro G in the disk is remarkably high. We use the spectral
aging of the cosmic ray electrons (CREs) seen in the vertical profiles of the
spectral index to determine a lower limit for the global CR bulk speed as
(170+/-70) km/s. The linear correlation between the scaleheights and the CRE
lifetimes, as evident from the dumbbell shaped halo, requires a vertical CR
transport with a bulk speed of (300+/-30) km/s in the northeastern halo,
similar to the escape velocity of 280 km/s. This shows the presence of a ""disk

with a diffusion coefficient of (2.0+/-0.2) 10E29 cm^2 s^-1. In the

redshift induced by gravitational lensing. We include a treatment of

the information contained in the mean distance moduli of SNeIa and the
dispersion among SNeIa distance moduli complement each other, breaking a
degeneracy between the present dark energy equation of state and its time
variation without the need for a high-redshift supernova sample. To address
photometric redshift uncertainties, we present dark energy constraints as a
function of the size of an external set of spectroscopically-observed SNeIa
that may be used for redshift calibration, nspec. We find that an imaging
survey can constrain the dark energy equation of state at the epoch where it is
best constrained with a 1-sigma error of sigma(wpiv)~0.03-0.09$, depending upon
various assumptions. In addition, the marginal improvement in the error
sigma(wpiv) from an increase in the spectroscopic calibration sample drops once
nspec ~ 10^3. This result is important because it is of the order of the size
of calibration samples likely to be compiled in the coming decade and because,
for samples of this size, the spectroscopic and imaging surveys individually
place comparable constraints on the dark energy equation of state. In all
cases, it is best to calibrate photometric redshifts with a set of

running coupling g^2(0) in the region of low momentum where it is nearly
constant. The result, consistent with other estimates, is too low to drive
chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) for quarks in a standard gap equation that has
no explicit confinement effects. We recall and improve on old work showing that
confinement implies CSB for quarks, and consider CSB for test (that is,
quenched) Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation. Here the
previously-found value of $g^2(0)$ is large enough to drive CSB in a gap
equation, which we relate to the presence of center vortices (non-confining,
for the adjoint) and nexuses that drive fermionic zero modes. We discuss the
extension of adjoint CSB to finite temperature.

The local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differs
systematically from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. This is not due to
the presence of individual clumps or streams, but to broad features in the
velocity modulus and energy distributions that are stable both in space and

have a significant impact on the signals predicted for WIMP and axion searches.
For example, WIMP recoil rates can deviate by ~10% from those expected from the

typically peak at lower frequencies than in the case of multivariate Gaussian

Our analysis is based on a 2-D representation of the secular hydrodynamics,
which is treated using expansions in spherical harmonics. We present a full
reconstruction of the meridional circulation and of the associated fluctuations
of temperature and mean molecular weight along with diagnosis for the transport
of angular momentum, heat and chemicals. In the present paper these tools are
used to validate the analysis of two main sequence stellar models of 1.5 and 20
Msun for which the hydrodynamics has been previously extensively studied in the

different terms entering the angular momentum and heat transport equations in
radiative zones. This enables us to corroborate the main results obtained over
the past decade by Zahn, Maeder, and collaborators concerning the secular
hydrodynamics of such objects. We focus on the meridional circulation driven by
angular momentum losses and structural readjustements. We confirm
quantitatively for the first time through detailed computations and separation
of the various components that the advection of entropy by this circulation is
very well balanced by the barotropic effects and the thermal relaxation during
most of the main sequence evolution. This enables us to derive simplifications
for the thermal relaxation on this phase. The meridional currents in turn
advect heat and generate temperature fluctuations that induce differential
rotation through thermal wind thus closing the transport loop.

producing astronomically observed high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in
accreting black hole binary systems.
  Our simulated disks are geometrically-thin with a constant half-thickness of
five percent the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. A
pseudo-Newtonian potential reproduces the relevant effects of general
relativity, and an alpha-model viscosity achieves angular momentum transport
and the coupling of orthogonal velocity components in an otherwise ideal

  We find that our simulated viscous disks characteristically develop and
maintain trapped global mode oscillations with properties similar to those
expected of trapped g-modes and inner p-modes in a narrow range of frequencies
just below the maximum radial epicyclic frequency. Although the modes are
driven in the inner portion of the disk, they generate waves that propagate at
the trapped mode frequencies out to larger disk radii. This finding is
contrasted with the results of global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations, in
which such oscillations are not easily identified. Such examples underscore
fundamental physical differences between accretion systems driven by the
magneto-rotational instability and those for which alpha viscosity serves as a
proxy for the physical processes that drive accretion, and we explore potential

that decay or stabilize during inflation in a staggered fashion. The fields
driving assisted inflation are on flat, short stretches, before they encounter
a sharp drop; whenever a field encounters such a drop due to its slow roll
evolution, its energy is transferred to other degrees of freedom, i.e.
radiation. The rate at which fields decay is determined dynamically and it is
not a free parameter in this class of models. To compute observables, we
generalize the analytic framework of staggered inflation, allowing for more
general initial conditions and varying potentials. By searching for generic
situations arising on the landscape, we arrive at a setup involving linear or
hilltop potentials and evenly spread out initial field values. This scenario is
not more fine tuned than large-field models, despite the fact that many more
degrees of freedom are involved. Further, the $\eta$-problem can be alleviated.
  The additional decrease of the potential energy caused by the decay of fields
provides leading order contribution to observables, such as the scalar and
tensor spectral index or the tensor to scalar ratio, for which we derive
general expressions. We compare the predictions with WMAP5 constraints and find
that hilltop potentials are borderline ruled out at the $2\sigma$-level, while
linear potentials are in excellent agreement with observations. We further
comment on additional sources of gravitational waves and non-Gaussianities that
could serve as a smoking gun for staggered inflation.

production of fourth-generation down quarks, D4. We consider the typical masses
that could be associated with a strongly coupled fermion sector, in the range
(300--600) GeV. We show that the production and successive decay of these heavy
quarks into final states with same-sign dileptons, trileptons and four leptons,
can be easily seen above background with relatively low luminosity. On the
other hand, in order to confirm the presence of a new strong interaction
responsible for fourth-generation condensation, we study its contribution to D4
pair-production, and the potential to separate it from standard QCD-induced
heavy quark production. We show that this separation might require large
amounts of data. This is true even if it is assumed that the new interaction is
mediated by a massive colored vector boson, since its strong coupling to the
fourth generation renders its width of the order of its mass. We conclude that,

galaxy are themselves disk galaxies that formed from early major mergers
between galaxies with blue colors. A substantial thin stellar disk grows
rapidly following the last major merger and the present day properties of the
final remnant are typical of early type spiral galaxies, with an i band B/D
~0.65, a disk scale length of 7.2 kpc, g-r = 0.5 mag, an HI line width
(W_{20}/2) of 238 km/sec and total magnitude i = -22.4. The key ingredients for
the formation of a dominant stellar disk component after a major merger are: i)
substantial and rapid accretion of gas through cold flows followed at late
times by cooling of gas from the hot phase, ii) supernova feedback that is able
to partially suppress star formation during mergers and iii) relative fading of
the spheroidal component. The gas fraction of the progenitors' disks does not
exceed 25% at z<3, emphasizing that the continuous supply of gas from the local
environment plays a major role in the regrowth of disks and in keeping the
galaxies blue. The results of this simulation alleviate the problem posed for
the existence of disk galaxies by the high likelihood of interactions and
mergers for galaxy sized halos at relatively low z.

with a series of hierarchical states derived from the Moore-Read state - the

ridge of X-ray and radio continuum emission has been interpreted as the result
of shock heating, with support from observations at other wavelengths. We find
that gas in this ridge has a similar temperature (~0.6 keV) and abundance (~0.3
solar) to the surrounding diffuse emission, and that a hard emission component
is consistent with that expected from high-mass X-ray binaries associated with
star-formation in the ridge. The cooling rate of gas in the ridge is consistent
with the current star formation rate, suggesting that radiative cooling is
driving the observed star formation. The lack of a high-temperature gas
component is used to place constraints on the nature of the interaction and
shock, and we find that an oblique shock heating a pre-existing filament of HI
may be the most likely explanation of the X-ray gas in the ridge. The mass of
hot gas in the ridge is only ~2 per cent of the total mass of hot gas in the
group, which is roughly equal to the deficit in observed HI mass compared to
predictions. The hot gas component is too extended to have been heated by the
current interaction, strongly suggesting that it must have been heated during

scrutinizing the possibilities of theoretical calibrations for temperature,
metallicity and gravity. We show that the temperature sensitivity of the
synthetic (b-y) colour is very close to its empirical counterpart, whereas the
temperature scale based upon Hbeta shows a slight offset. The theoretical
metallicity sensitivity of the m1 index (and for G-type stars its combination
with c1) is somewhat larger than the empirical one, based upon spectroscopic
determinations. The gravity sensitivity of the synthetic c1 index shows a
satisfactory behaviour when compared to obervations of F stars. For stars
cooler than the sun a deviation is significant in the c1-(b-y) diagram. The
theoretical calibrations of (b-y), (v-y) and c1 seem to work well for Pop II
stars and lead to effective temperatures for globular cluster stars supporting
recent claims by Korn et al. (2007) that atomic diffusion occurs in stars near
the turnoff point of NGC 6397. Synthetic colours of stellar atmospheres can
indeed be used, in many cases, to derive reliable fundamental stellar

due to incomplete linelists but are possibly also due to effects of assuming

the Seebeck coefficient considering the source-drain electrodes with distinct

compare the Seebeck coefficient in the amino-substituted and unsubstituted
butanethiol junction and observe interesting thermoelectric properties in the
amino-substituted junction. Due to the novel states around the Fermi levels
introduced by the amino-substitution, the Seebeck coefficient could be easily
modulated by using gate voltages and biases. When the temperature in one of the
electrodes is fixed, the Seebeck coefficient varies significantly with the
temperature in the other electrode, and such dependence could be modulated by
varying the gate voltages. As the biases increase, richer features in the
Seebeck coefficient are observed, which are closely related to the transmission
functions in the vicinity of the left and right Fermi levels.

The probability of an observer in our bubble detecting the effects of

the Universe by using statistical quantities which can find the angular scale
of the correlation. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite Point Source Redshift
Survey (IRAS PSCz) catalog of galaxies is adopted for LSS. We find a positive
correlation of the highest energy events detected by the Pierre Auger
Observatory (PAO) with the IRAS galaxies inside $z=0.018$ within the angular
scale of $\sim 15^{\circ}$. This positive correlation observed in the southern
sky implies that a significant fraction of the highest energy events comes from
nearby extragalactic objects. We also analyze the data of the Akeno Giant Air
Shower Array (AGASA) which observed the northern hemisphere, but the obvious
signals of positive correlation with the galaxy distribution are not found.
Since the exposure of the AGASA is smaller than the PAO, the cross-correlation
in the northern sky should be tested using a larger number of events detected
in the future. We also discuss the correlation using the all-sky combined data
sets of both the PAO and AGASA, and find a significant correlation within $\sim
8^{\circ}$. These angular scales can constrain several models of intergalactic
magnetic field. These cross-correlation signals can be well reproduced by a
source model in which the distribution of UHECR sources is related to the IRAS
galaxies.

cluster members have been detected at 24 micron. The IR luminosity function in
A3266 is very similar to that in the Coma cluster down to the detection limit
L_IR~10^43 ergs/s, suggesting a universal form of the bright end IR LF for
local rich clusters with M~10^15 M_sun. The shape of the bright end of the
A3266-Coma composite IR LF is not significantly different from that of nearby
field galaxies, but the fraction of IR-bright galaxies (SFR > 0.2M_sun/yr) in
both clusters increases with cluster-centric radius. The decrease of the blue
galaxy fraction toward the high density cores only accounts for part of the
trend; the fraction of red galaxies with moderate SFRs (0.2 < SFR < 1 M_sun/yr)
also decreases with increasing galaxy density. These results suggest that for
the IR bright galaxies, nearby rich clusters are distinguished from the field
by a lower star-forming galaxy fraction, but not by a change in L*_IR. The
composite IR LF of Coma and A3266 shows strong evolution when compared with the
composite IR LF of two z~0.8 clusters, MS 1054 and RX J0152, with L*_IR \propto
(1+z)^{3.2+/-0.7},Phi*_IR \propto (1+z)^{1.7+/-1.0}. This L*_IR evolution is
indistinguishable from that in the field, and the Phi*_IR evolution is
stronger, but still consistent with that in the field. The similarity of the
evolution of bright-end IR LF in very different cluster and field environments
suggests either this evolution is driven by the mechanism that works in both
environments, or clusters continually replenish their star-forming galaxies
from the field, yielding an evolution in the IR LF that is similar to the
field. The mass-normalized integrated star formation rates (SFRs) of clusters
within 0.5R_200 also evolve strongly with redshift, as (1+z)^5.3.

scattered within an open entrance channel-- the state observable at infinity,
they may enter an intermediate closed channel -- the locally bounded state of
the nuclei. If the energy of a bound state of in the closed channel is
fine-tuned to match the relative kinetic energy, then the open channel and the
closed channel ""resonate"", so that the scattering length becomes divergent. We
find that this so-called Feshbach resonance phenomenon not only exists during
the collisions of massive particles, but also emerges during the coherent
transport of massless particles, that is, photons confined in the coupled
resonator arrays \cite{lzhou08}. We implement the open and the closed channels
inside a pair of such arrays, linked by a separated cavity or a tunable qubit.
When a single photon is bounded inside the closed channel by setting the
relevant physical parameters appropriately, the vanishing transmission appears
to display this photonic Feshbach resonance. The general construction can be
implemented through various experimentally feasible solid state systems, such
as the couple defected cavities in photonic crystals. The numerical simulation

Spitzer Space Telescope and GALEX. In this system, the central nucleus of NGC
2445 is surrounded by knots of massive star-formation in a ring-like structure.
We find unusually strong emission from warm H$_2$ associated with an expanding
shock wave between the nucleus and the western knots. At this ridge, the flux
ratio between H$_2$ and PAH emission is nearly ten times higher than in the
nucleus. Arp 143 is one of the most extreme cases known in that regard. From
our multi-wavelength data we derive a narrow age range of the star-forming
knots between 2 Myr and 7.5 Myr, suggesting that the ring of knots was formed
almost simultaneously in response to the shock wave traced by the H$_2$
emission. However, the knots can be further subdivided in two age groups: those
with an age of 2--4 Myr (knots A, C, E, and F), which are associated with
$8\mu$m emission from PAHs, and those with an age of 7-8 Myr (knots D and G),
which show little or no $8\mu$m emission shells surrounding them. We attribute
this finding to an ageing effect of the massive clusters which, after about 6
Myr, no longer excite the PAHs surrounding the knots.

cascade of shocks is expected, where optically thick shocks give rise to
optical/UV emission, while optically thin shocks give rise to X-ray emission.
The resulting blue bump temperature is found to be quite similar in different
AGNs. We obtain that the ratio of X-ray luminosity to UV luminosity is smaller
than unity, and that this ratio is smaller in massive objects compared to less
massive sources. This is in agreement with the observed $L_{X}/L_{UV}$ ratio
and suggests a possible interpretation of the $\alpha_{OX}-l_{UV}$
anticorrelation.

coupled to a single cavity mode is described by the Rabi Hamiltonian. We show
that, in the dispersive regime, when the modulation periodicity is tuned to the
`resonances', the system dynamics presents the dynamical Casimir effect,
resonant Jaynes-Cummings or resonant Anti-Jaynes-Cummings behaviors, and it can
be described by the corresponding effective Hamiltonians. In the resonant
atom-cavity regime and under the resonant modulation, the dynamics is similar
to the one occurring for a stationary two-level atom in a vibrating cavity, and
an entangled state with two photons can be created from vacuum. Moreover, we
consider the situation in which the atom-cavity coupling, the atomic frequency,
or both have a small nonperiodic time modulation, and show that photons can be
created from vacuum in the dispersive regime. Therefore, an analog of the
dynamical Casimir effect can be simulated in circuit QED, and several photons,
as well as entangled states, can be generated from vacuum due to the
anti-rotating term in the Rabi Hamiltonian.

no or little motion. The histogram of the UD diameters exhibits a maximum at
225km, i.e. most of the UDs are spatially resolved. UDs display a typical
horizontal velocity of 420m/s and a typical peak intensity of 51% of the mean
intensity of the quiet photosphere, making them on average 20% brighter than
the local umbral background. Almost all mobile UDs (large birth-death distance)
were born close to the umbra-penumbra boundary, move towards the umbral center,
and are brighter than average. Notably bright and mobile UDs were also observed
along a prominent UD chain, both ends of which are located at the
umbra-penumbra boundary. Their motion started primarily at either of the ends
of the chain, continued along the chain, and ended near the chain's center. We
observed the splitting and merging of UDs and the temporal succession of both.
For the first time the evolution of brightness, size, and horizontal speed of a
typical UD could be determined in a statistically significant way. Considerable
differences between the evolution of central and peripheral UDs are found,
which point to a difference in origin.

the masses of positive and negative ions. For the case where the negative ion
density is close to its critical value, a soliton solution is found that takes

causes soliton dynamics to be predominantly repulsive in one dimensional

three-dimensional simulations do not support this conclusion and in fact show
that quantum noise has a negative impact on bright solitary wave lifetimes.

on higher-order statistics (HOS), the latter better known as independent

response of a strongly coupled plasma at finite temperature to a hard probe.
The plasma is that of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the hard
probe is a virtual photon, or, more precisely, an R-current. Via the
gauge/gravity duality, the problem of the current interacting with the plasma
is mapped onto the gravitational interaction between a Maxwell field and a
black hole embedded in the AdS_5 x S^5 geometry. The physical interpretation of
the AdS/CFT results can be then reconstructed with the help of the
ultraviolet/infrared correspondence. We thus deduce that, for sufficiently high
energy, the photon (or any other hard probe: a quark, a gluon, or a meson)
disappears into the plasma via a universal mechanism, which is quasi-democratic
parton branching: the current develops a parton cascade such that, at any step
in the branching process, the energy is almost equally divided among the
daughter partons. The branching rate is controlled by the plasma which acts on
the colored partons with a constant force ~ T^2. When reinterpreted in the
plasma infinite momentum frame, the same AdS/CFT results suggest a parton
picture for the plasma structure functions, in which all the partons have
fallen at very small values of Bjorken's x. For a time-like current in the
vacuum, quasi-democratic branching implies that there should be no jets in
electron-positron annihilation at strong coupling, but only a spatially
isotropic distribution of hadronic matter.

local cavity filled with hot recombining gas. Numerical high resolution 3D
simulations of a supernova driven inhomogeneous interstellar medium show that
we can reproduce both the extension of the LB and the OVI column density in

demonstrate that the LB evolves like an ordinary superbubble expanding into a

suggest that LB blow-out into the Milky Way halo has occurred roughly 5 Myr

galaxy Mrk 279 using three epochs of observations from the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and two epochs of observations with the Space

finding simple photoionization responses of the absorbing gas to changes in the
underlying continuum, the observed changes in the absorption profiles can be
understood more clearly if the effective covering fraction of the gas in all
emission components, continuum and broad and intermediate velocity width
emission lines, is accounted for. While we do not uniquely solve for all of
these separate covering fractions and the ionic column densities using the
spectral data, we examine the parameter space using previously well-constrained
solutions for continuum and single emission component covering fractions.
Assuming full coverage of the continuum, we find that of the two velocity
components of the Mrk 279 absorption most likely associated with its outflow,
one likely has zero coverage of the intermediate line region while the other
does not. For each component, however, the broad line region is more fully
covered than the intermediate line region. Changes in the O VI column densities
are unconstrained due to saturation, but we show that small changes in the
nonsaturated C IV and N V column densities are consistent with the outflow gas
having zero or partial covering of the intermediate line region and an
ionization parameter changing from ~0.01 to ~0.1 from 2002 to 2003 as the UV
continuum flux increased by a factor of ~8. The absence of a change in the C
III absorbing column density is attributed to this species arising outside the

theory and of physics of material systems (continuous media) the concept of
""conservation laws"" has a different meaning. In field theory ""conservation
laws"" are those that claim the existence of conservative physical quantities or
objects. These are conservation laws for physical fields. In contrast to that
in physics (and mechanics) of material systems the concept of ""conservation
laws"" relates to conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, angular
momentum, and mass that establish the balance between the change of physical
quantities and external action.
  In the paper presented it is proved that there exist a connection between of
conservation laws for physical fields and those for material systems. This
points to the fact that physical fields are connected with material systems.
Such results has an unique significance for field theories. This enables one to
substantiate many basic principles of field theories, such as, for example, the
unity of existing field theories and the causality. The specific feature of
field theory equations, namely, their connection to the equations for material
systems, is elicited. Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric

typical configurations, we find the three scenarios predict quite different
spectra and skymaps of the synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, though
there are relatively large uncertainties. The most prominent differences come
from the energy band $10^4\sim 10^9$ MHz for synchrotron emission and $\gtrsim
10$ GeV for inverse Compton emission. It might be able to discriminate at least
the annihilating dark matter scenario from the other two given the high
precision synchrotron and diffuse $\gamma$-ray skymaps in the future.

a strong reduction in the relevant theory uncertainties will be necessary.

specially designed Fabry-Perot laser that supports two primary modes with a THz

a rich variety of single and two-mode dynamical scenarios, which are reproduced
with remarkable accuracy by a four dimensional rate equation model. Numerical
bifurcation analysis reveals the importance of torus bifurcations in mediating
transitions to antiphase dynamics and of saddle-node of limit cycle
bifurcations in switching of the dynamics between single and two-mode regimes.

on the case that F = Z_p is a finite field. As part of this investigation, we
develop methods, using the tools of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra,

unitarity limit for infinite scattering length. The exact solution for the
two-body sector is consistent with the unitary fixed point behavior for all

s-wave sector develops a limit cycle scaling in case of U(1) bosons and SU(3)

solids and glasses. This article reviews research concerning electronic
excitations in materials under extreme conditions using inelastic x-ray
scattering (IXS). IXS is a spectroscopic probe of choice for this study because
of its chemical and orbital selectivity and the richness of information it
provides. Being an all-photon technique, IXS has a penetration depth compatible
with high pressure requirements. Electronic transitions under pressure in 3d
transition metals compounds and $f$-electron systems, most of them strongly
correlated, are reviewed. Implications for geophysics are mentioned. Since the
incident X-ray energy can easily be tuned to absorption edges, resonant IXS,
often employed, is discussed at length. Finally studies involving local
structure changes and electronic transitions under pressure in materials
containing light elements are briefly reviewed.
