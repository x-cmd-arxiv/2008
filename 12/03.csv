appreciable if even a small component of the dark matter is extremely cold.
Subhalo substructure provides such a possibility given that the smallest clumps
are relatively cold and contain even colder substructure due to incomplete
phase space mixing. Leptonic channels can be enhanced for plausible models and
the solar neighbourhood boost required to account for PAMELA/ATIC data is
plausibly obtained, especially in the case of a few TeV mass neutralino for
which the Sommerfeld-corrected boost is found to be $\sim10^4-10^5.$ Saturation
of the Sommerfeld effect is shown to occur below $\beta\sim 10^{-4},$ thereby
constraining the range of contributing substructures to be above $\sim 10^5\rm
M_\odot.$ We find that the associated diffuse gamma ray signal from
annihilations would exceed EGRET constraints unless the channels annihilating
to heavy quarks or to gauge bosons are suppressed. The lepton channel gamma
rays are potentially detectable by the FERMI satellite, not from the inner
galaxy where substructures are tidally disrupted, but rather as a
quasi-isotropic background from the outer halo, unless the outer substructures
are much less concentrated than the inner substructures and/or the CDM density
profile out to the virial radius steepens significantly.

associated with accretion through a non-axisymmetric magnetic boundary layer in
the unstable regime, when two ordered equatorial streams form and rotate
synchronously at approximately the angular velocity of the inner disk The
streams hit the star's surface producing hot spots. Rotation of the spots leads
to high-frequency QPOs. We performed a number of simulation runs for different
magnetospheric sizes from small to tiny, and observed a definite correlation
between the inner disk radius and the QPO frequency: the frequency is higher
when the magnetosphere is smaller. In the stable regime a small magnetosphere
forms and accretion through the usual funnel streams is observed, and the
frequency of the star is expected to dominate the lightcurve. We performed
exploratory investigations of the case in which the magnetosphere becomes
negligibly small and the disk interacts with the star through an equatorial
belt. We also performed investigation of somewhat larger magnetospheres where
one or two ordered tongues may dominate over other chaotic tongues. In
application to millisecond pulsars we obtain QPO frequencies in the range of
350 Hz to 990 Hz for one spot. The frequency associated with rotation of one
spot may dominate if spots are not identical or antipodal. If the spots are
similar and antipodal then the frequencies are twice as high. We show that
variation of the accretion rate leads to drift of the QPO peak.

probability of the different regions of the MSSM parameter space, taking into
account the present, theoretical and experimental, wisdom about the model.
Since the present experimental data are not powerful enough to select a small
region of the MSSM parameter space, the choice of a judicious prior probability
for the parameters becomes most relevant. Previous studies have proposed
theoretical priors that incorporate some (conventional) measure of the
fine-tuning, to penalize unnatural possibilities. However, we show that such
penalization arises from the Bayesian analysis itself (with no ad hoc
assumptions), upon the marginalization of the mu-parameter. Furthermore the
resulting effective prior contains precisely the Barbieri-Giudice measure,
which is very satisfactory. On the other hand we carry on a rigorous treatment
of the Yukawa couplings, showing in particular that the usual practice of
taking the Yukawas ""as required"", approximately corresponds to taking
logarithmically flat priors in the Yukawa couplings. Finally, we use an
efficient set of variables to scan the MSSM parameter space, trading in
particular B by tan beta, giving the effective prior in the new parameters.
Beside the numerical results, we give accurate analytic expressions for the
effective priors in all cases. Whatever experimental information one may use in
the future, it is to be weighted by the Bayesian factors worked out here.

adiabatic phonons. We find that the system enters in an incommensurate phase by
a first order transition at a low temperature $T_{c1}$. At a higher temperature
$T_{c2}$ a continuous transition to a uniform phase is found. Furthermore, we
study the magnetism in the incommensurate phase by Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations on a 1D Heisenberg model where the
exchange is modulated by the incommensurate atomic position pattern. When the
wave vector $q$ of the modulation is near $\pi$, we find local magnetized zones
(LMZ) in which spins get free from their singlets as a result of the domain
walls induced by the modulated distortion. When $q$ moves away enough from
$\pi$, the LMZ disappear and the system develops incommensurate magnetic
correlations induced by the structure. We discuss the relevance of this result
regarding to previous and future experiments in TiOCl.

enhanced forces are suppressed inside halos and the effects on halo properties
are substantially reduced for the most massive halos. Nonetheless, the scaling

way as S and Ar, which are not expected to be affected by nucleosynthetic
processes during the evolution of the PN progenitors. The PN oxygen abundance
distribution is shifted to lower values by 0.3 dex with respect to the

  Creation Rate in Electroporation Models and Theory","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under externally applied electric fields, lipid membranes tend to permeate
and change their electrical resistance by the combined processes of pore
creation and pore evolution (expansion or contraction). This study is focused
on the pore creation process, represented by an empirical expression currently
used in the electroporation (EP) models, for which an alternative theoretically
based expression was provided. The choice of this expression was motivated by
the role the DLVO's (disjoining) pressures may play in the process of EP. The
electrostatic energy effects on each sides of a lipid membrane were evaluated
in terms of the electrostatic component of the disjoining pressure. Thus the
pore creation energy considerations in the current EP models, associated with
the necessity of an idealized non conducting circular pre-pore were avoided. As
a result, a new expression for the onset of the electroporation was proposed.
It was found that this new theoretically determined expression is in good
agreement with the one estimated from an experiment that specifically targeted
the pore nucleation by eliminating the pore evolution process. Furthermore, the
proposed expression is dependent on the electrolyte and the lipid properties
and should provide better predictability than the currently used pore creation
EP model, which is only temperature dependent.

of an object. It has recently been studied extensively in scientific databases
and other settings due to its importance in helping scientists judge data
validity, quality and integrity. However, most models of provenance have been
stated as ad hoc definitions motivated by informal concepts such as ""comes
from"", ""influences"", ""produces"", or ""depends on"". These models lack clear
formalizations describing in what sense the definitions capture these intuitive
concepts. This makes it difficult to compare approaches, evaluate their
effectiveness, or argue about their validity.
  We introduce provenance traces, a general form of provenance for the nested
relational calculus (NRC), a core database query language. Provenance traces
can be thought of as concrete data structures representing the operational
semantics derivation of a computation; they are related to the traces that have
been used in self-adjusting computation, but differ in important respects. We
define a tracing operational semantics for NRC queries that produces both an
ordinary result and a trace of the execution. We show that three pre-existing
forms of provenance for the NRC can be extracted from provenance traces.
Moreover, traces satisfy two semantic guarantees: consistency, meaning that the
traces describe what actually happened during execution, and fidelity, meaning
that the traces ""explain"" how the expression would behave if the input were
changed. These guarantees are much stronger than those contemplated for
previous approaches to provenance; thus, provenance traces provide a general
semantic foundation for comparing and unifying models of provenance in
databases.

the magnetic moment distribution for such arrays which concentrates on the
immediate vicinity of each antidot. For each antidot distribution (square or
hexagonal) a suitable system of coordinates is defined to exploit the shape of
the unit-cells of the overall nanostructure. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown
equations that govern the distribution of moments are rewritten in terms of
these coordinates. The equilibrium moments orientation is calculated for each
position in a Cartesian grid defined for these new coordinate systems, and then
a conformal transformation is applied to insert the moment vectors into the
actual unit-cell. The resulting vector maps display quite clearly regions of
different moment orientation around the antidots, which can be associated with
nanoscale domains. These results are similar to the ones obtained by other
authors[1-4] using the NIST oommf method.

the stellar center by dynamical friction, creating a larger black hole which

suggested that Type I planet migration can be halted in disks of sufficiently
low turbulent viscosity, for $\alpha \sim 10^{-4}$. The halting is due to a
feedback effect of breaking density waves that results in a slight mass
redistribution and consequently an increased outward torque contribution. The
simulations confirm the existence of a critical mass ($M_{cr} \sim 10
M_{\oplus}$) beyond which migration halts in nearly laminar disks. For $\alpha
\ga 10^{-3}$, density feedback effects are washed out and Type I migration
persists. The critical masses are in good agreement with the analytic model of
Rafikov (2002). In addition, for $\alpha \la 10^{-4}$ steep density gradients
produce a vortex instability, resulting in a small time-varying eccentricity in
the planet's orbit and a slight outward migration. Migration in nearly laminar
disks may be sufficiently slow to reconcile the timescales of migration theory
with those of giant planet formation in the core accretion model.

quark matter is evaluated as a function of the diquark coupling strength and a

This effect consists in the transition of bound states into the continuum of

masses and spins), as few as the $\simeq 5$ merger detections could exhaust the

concrete example, we use a nearby-universe catalog to demonstrate that no one

systematic error of order $O(30%)$ at 90% confidence. More generally, we argue
that theoretical binary evolution can depend sufficiently sensitively on

however, the recently launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly known
as GLAST, could provide the first detections in the near future. Clusters are
expected to emit gamma rays as a result of (1) a population of high-energy
primary and re-accelerated secondary cosmic rays (CR) fueled by structure
formation and merger shocks, active galactic nuclei and supernovae, and (2)
particle dark matter (DM) annihilation. In this paper, we ask the question of
whether the Fermi telescope will be able to discriminate between the two
emission processes. We present data-driven predictions for a large X-ray flux
limited sample of galaxy clusters and groups. We point out that the gamma ray
signals from CR and DM can be comparable. In particular, we find that poor
clusters and groups are the systems predicted to have the highest DM to CR
emission at gamma-ray energies. Based on detailed Fermi simulations, we study
observational handles that might enable us to distinguish the two emission
mechanisms, including the gamma-ray spectra, the spatial distribution of the
signal and the associated multi-wavelength emissions. We also propose optimal
hardness ratios, which will help to understand the nature of the gamma-ray
emission. Our study indicates that gamma rays from DM annihilation with a high
particle mass can be distinguished from a CR spectrum even for fairly faint
sources. Discriminating a CR spectrum from a light DM particle will be instead
much more difficult, and will require long observations and/or a bright source.
While the gamma-ray emission from our simulated clusters is extended,
determining the spatial distribution with Fermi will be a challenging task
requiring an optimal control of the backgrounds.

fractional BBC (Bounded Budget Connection) games. BGP is the glue that holds
the Internet together and hence its stability, i.e. the equilibria of
fractional BGP games (Haxell, Wilfong), is a matter of practical importance.
BBC games (Laoutaris et al) follow in the tradition of the large body of work
on network formation games and capture a variety of applications ranging from
social networks and overlay networks to peer-to-peer networks.
  The central result of this paper is that there are no fully polynomial-time
approximation schemes (unless PPAD is in FP) for computing equilibria in both
fractional BGP games and fractional BBC games. We obtain this result by proving
the hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference
game, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games.
  We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games --
personalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP
games. We prove not just the existence, but the existence of rational
personalized equilibria for all matrix games, which implies the existence of
rational equilibria for fractional BGP and BBC games. In particular, this
provides an alternative proof and strengthening of the main result in [Haxell,
Wilfong]. For k-player matrix games, where k = 2, we provide a combinatorial
characterization leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing all
personalized equilibria. For k >= 5, we prove that personalized equilibria are
PPAD-hard to approximate in fully polynomial time. We believe that the concept
of personalized equilibria has potential for real-world significance.

  Methods: High precision photometric observations have been obtained in g',
r', i', and z' band simultaneously, using the new GROND detector, mounted on
the MPI/ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla. Eight epochs of high-dispersion
spectroscopic observations were obtained using the fiber-fed FLAMES/UVES

  Results: The photometric transit, now more than 7 years after the last
OGLE-II observations, was re-discovered only ~8 minutes from its predicted
time. The primary object is a fast rotating F3 star, with vsini=39.33+-0.38

R_p=1.61+-0.04 R_Jup. The rejection of possible blend scenarios was based on a

galactic winds have reduced the fraction of baryons in the warm, photoionized
phase (the Lya forest) from nearly 100% in the early universe to less than 50%
today. Some of the remaining baryons are predicted to lie in the warm-hot
ionized medium (WHIM) phase at T=10^5-10^7 K, but the quantity remains a highly
tunable parameter of the models. Modern UV spectrographs have provided
unprecedented access to both the Lya forest and potential WHIM tracers at z~0,
and several independent groups have constructed large catalogs of far-UV IGM
absorbers along ~30 AGN sight lines. There is general agreement between the
surveys that the warm, photoionized phase makes up ~30% of the baryon budget at
z~0. Another ~10% can be accounted for in collapsed structures (stars,
galaxies, etc.). However, interpretation of the ~100 high-ion (OVI, etc)
absorbers at z<0.5 is more controversial. These species are readily created in
the shocks expected to exist in the IGM, but they can also be created by
photoionization and thus not represent WHIM material. Given several pieces of
observational evidence and theoretical expectations, I argue that most of the
observed OVI absorbers represent shocked gas at T~300,000 K rather than
photoionized gas at T<30,000 K, and they are consequently valid tracers of the
WHIM phase. Under this assumption, enriched gas at T=10^5-10^6 K can account
for ~10% of the baryon budget at z<0.5, but this value may increase when bias
and incompleteness are taken into account and help close the gap on the 50% of
the baryons still ""missing"".

the dominant is the process when the formation and the decay of a string occur

simple superposition principle applies and each community plays the role of a
microscopic spin governed by a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson and
Palmer) equations. The relative susceptibilities derived from these equations
calculated at finite or zero temperature (where the method provides an
effective percolation theory) give us the answers to the above issues. As for
the already studied case n=1, these equations are exact in the paramagnetic
regions (at T=0 this means below the percolation threshold) and provide
effective approximations in the other regions. However, unlike the case n=1,
asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the
equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative
short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n and glassy
scenarios with a remarkable presence of abrupt jumps take place. Furthermore,
as a byproduct, from the relative susceptibilities a natural and efficient
method to detect the community structure of a generic network emerges.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have reported that a significant number of these
objects show double main-sequence turn-offs (DMSTOs) in their color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs). One plausible explanation for the origin of these DMSTOs is
that the SCs are composed of two different stellar populations with age
differences of ~ 300 Myr. Based on analytical methods and numerical
simulations, we explore a new scenario in which SCs interact and merge with
star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to form new composite SCs with two
distinct component populations. In this new scenario, the possible age
differences between the two different stellar populations responsible for the
DMSTOs are due largely to secondary star formation within GMCs interacting and
merging with already-existing SCs in the LMC disk. The total gas masses being
converted into new stars (i.e., the second generation of stars) during GMC-SC
interaction and merging can be comparable to or larger than the masses of the
original SCs (i.e, the first generation of stars) in this scenario. Our
simulations show that the spatial distributions of new stars in composite SCs
formed from GMC-SC merging are more compact than those of stars initially in
the SCs. We discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the new scenario in
explaining fundamental properties of SCs with DMSTOs in the LMC and in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We also discuss the merits of various alternative
scenarios for the origin of the DMSTOs.

test of the LCDM model, providing constraints on the nature of dark matter.
Recent work investigating mass distributions of individual galaxy clusters
(e.g. Abell 1689) using weak and strong gravitational lensing has revealed
potential inconsistencies between the predictions of structure formation models
relating halo mass to concentration and those relationships as measured in
massive clusters. However, such analyses employ simple spherical halo models
while a growing body of work indicates that triaxial 3D halo structure is both
common and important in parameter estimates. We recently introduced a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit fully triaxial models to weak lensing
data that gives parameter and error estimates that fully incorporate the true
shape uncertainty present in nature. In this paper we apply that method to weak
lensing data obtained with the ESO/MPG Wide-Field Imager for galaxy clusters
A1689, A1835, and A2204, under a range of Bayesian priors derived from theory
and from independent X-ray and strong lensing observations. For Abell 1689,
using a simple strong lensing prior we find marginalized mean parameter values
M_200 = (0.83 +- 0.16)x10^15 M_solar/h and C=12.2 +- 6.7, which are marginally
consistent with the mass-concentration relation predicted in LCDM. The large
error contours that accompany our triaxial parameter estimates more accurately
represent the true extent of our limited knowledge of the structure of galaxy
cluster lenses, and make clear the importance of combining many constraints
from other theoretical, lensing (strong, flexion), or other observational
(X-ray, SZ, dynamical) data to confidently measure cluster mass profiles.

Basically the Lyapunov stability analysis was substituted by the Ricci
sectional curvature analysis. In this report we apply Pettini's geometrical
framework to determine the potential energy of a twisted magnetic flux tube,
from its curved Riemannian geometry. Actually the Lyapunov exponents, are
connected to a Riemann metric tensor, of the twisted magnetic flux tubes
(MFTs). The Hamiltonian flow inside the tube is actually given by Perelman
Ricci flows constraints in twisted magnetic flux tubes, where the Lyapunov
eigenvalue spectra for the Ricci tensor associated with the Ricci flow equation
in MFTs leads to a finite-time Lyapunov exponential stretching along the
toroidal direction of the tube and a contraction along the radial direction of
the tube. The Jacobi equation for the MFTs is shown to have a constant
sectional Ricci curvature which allows us to compute the Jacobi-Levi-Civita
(JLC) geodesic deviation for the spread of lines on the tube manifold and
chaotic action through the greatest of its Lyapunov exponents. By analyzing the
spectra of the twisted MFT, it is shown that the greater exponent is positive

have a large albedo even in the infrared, the effect of scattering of the
diffuse radiation in the discs on the interior temperature should be examined.
We have performed a series of numerical radiation transfer simulations
including isotropic scattering by grains with various typical sizes for the
diffuse radiation as well as for the incident stellar radiation. We also have
developed an analytic model including isotropic scattering to understand the
physics concealed in the numerical results. With the analytic model, we have
shown that the standard two-layer approach is valid only for grey opacity (i.e.
grain size $\ga10$ \micron) even without scattering. A three-layer
interpretation is required for grain size $\la10$ \micron. When the grain size
is 0.1--10 \micron, the numerical simulations show that isotropic scattering
reduces the temperature of the disc interior. This reduction is nicely
explained by the analytic three-layer model as a result of the energy loss by
scatterings of the incident stellar radiation and of the warm diffuse radiation
in the disc atmosphere. For grain size $\ga10$ \micron (i.e. grey scattering),
the numerical simulations show that isotropic scattering does not affect the
interior temperature. This is nicely explained by the analytic two-layer model;
the energy loss by scattering in the disc atmosphere is exactly offset by the
""green-house effect"" due to scattering of the cold diffuse radiation in the

(SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of
the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11663 deg^2 of imaging data, with most
of the roughly 2000 deg^2 increment over the previous data release lying in
regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for
357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry over
250 deg^2 along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap. A
coaddition of these data goes roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main
survey. The spectroscopy is now complete over a contiguous area of 7500 deg^2
in the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data
releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000
galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes
improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all
been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog
(UCAC-2), reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45
milli-arcseconds per coordinate. A systematic error in bright galaxy photometr
is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally,
we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including
better flat-fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end,
better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and
an improved determination of stellar metallicities. (Abridged)

universe, is emerging as a promising alternative to dark energy. Various $f(R)$
gravity models have been intensively tested against probes of the expansion
history, including type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). In this paper we propose to use
the statistical lens sample from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search
Data Release 3 (SQLS DR3) to constrain $f(R)$ gravity models. This sample can
probe the expansion history up to $z\sim2.2$, higher than what probed by
current SNIa and BAO data. We adopt a typical parameterization of the form
$f(R)=R-\alpha H^2_0(-\frac{R}{H^2_0})^\beta$ with $\alpha$ and $\beta$
constants. For $\beta=0$ ($\Lambda$CDM), we obtain the best-fit value of the
parameter $\alpha=-4.193$, for which the 95% confidence interval that is
[-4.633, -3.754]. This best-fit value of $\alpha$ corresponds to the matter
density parameter $\Omega_{m0}=0.301$, consistent with constraints from other
probes. Allowing $\beta$ to be free, the best-fit parameters are $(\alpha,
\beta)=(-3.777, 0.06195)$. Consequently, we give $\Omega_{m0}=0.285$ and the
deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.544$. At the 95% confidence level, $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ are constrained to [-4.67, -2.89] and [-0.078, 0.202] respectively.
Clearly, given the currently limited sample size, we can only constrain $\beta$
within the accuracy of $\Delta\beta\sim 0.1$ and thus can not distinguish
between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity with high significance, and actually,
the former lies in the 68% confidence contour. We expect that the extension of
the SQLS DR3 lens sample to the SDSS DR5 and SDSS-II will make constraints on
the model more stringent.

the in-medium nucleon mass and density dependent coupling constants,
neutron-proton Cooper pairs could be in BEC state at sufficiently low density,
but there is no chance for the BEC formation of neutron-neutron and
proton-proton pairs at any density and asymmetry. We calculate the phase
diagram in asymmetry-temperature plane for weakly interacting nuclear
superfluid, and find that including the I = 1 channel changes significantly the
phase structure at low temperature. There appears a new phase with both I = 0
and I = 1 pairings at low temperature and low asymmetry, and the gapless state
in any phase with I = 1 pairing is washed out and all excited nucleons are
fully gapped.

middle half and last half. Under a multinomial model set up holding appreciably
in the first two phases, only one opinion is found acceptable. In the last
phase the distribution seems to be quasi multinomial, characterized by an
unstable nature of relative occurrence of pitch of all the notes and although
the note whose relative occurrence of pitch suddenly shoots is the Vadi swar
selected from our analysis of the first two phases, we take it as an outlier

Vadi-Samvadi notes in a quasi-multinomial set up is still an open research

several ideas like melodic property of notes, note combinations and pitch
movements between notes, using some weighted combination of psychological and
statistical stability of notes along with watching carefully the sudden shoot
of one or more notes whenever there is enough evidence that multinomial model

open new ways to design intense single attosecond pulses.

B",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the time evolution of fragmented animal populations and their
habitats, connected by migration, is a problem of both theoretical and
practical interest. This paper presents a method for calculating the time
evolution of the habitats' population size distribution from a general
stochastic dynamic within each habitat, using a deterministic approximation
which becomes exact for an infinite number of habitats. Fragmented populations
are usually thought to be characterized by a separation of time scale between,
on the one hand, colonization and extinction of habitats and, on the other
hand, the local population dynamics within each habitat. The analysis in this
paper suggests an alternative view: the effective population dynamic stems from
a law of large numbers, where stochastic fluctuations in population size of
single habitats are buffered through the dispersal pool so that the global
population dynamic remains approximately smooth. For illustration, the
deterministic approximation is compared to simulations of a stochastic model
with density dependent local recruitment and mortality. The article is
concluded with a discussion of the general implications of the results, and
possible extensions of the method.

parton distributions have sizeable impact on the Callan-Gross ratio in a wide
region of $x$ and $Q^2$. In particular, the ACOT($\chi$) predictions for the
quantity $R(x,Q^2)$ are about half as large as the corresponding expectations
of the photon-gluon fusion mechanism for $x\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ and $Q^2\gg
m^2$. This is because the structure functions $F_T (x,Q^2)$ and $F_L (x,Q^2)$
have different dependences on the mass logarithms of the type
$\alpha_{s}\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$. On the other hand, our recent studies indicate
that, contrary to the production cross sections, the Callan-Gross ratio is
sufficiently stable under radiative corrections to the photon-gluon fusion
component for $x\gtrsim 10^{-4}$. We conclude that the quantity $R(x,Q^2)$ in
heavy-quark leptoproduction is perturbatively stable but sensitive to
resummation of the mass logarithms. For this reason, in contrast to the
structure functions, the ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ could be good probe of the
charm density in the proton.

aim is to assign tasks on nodes according to a global scheduling policy and a
view of local resources of nodes. A peer-to-peer approach for the task
management involves a better scalability for the grid and a higher fault
tolerance. But some mechanisms have to be proposed to avoid the computation of
replicated tasks that can reduce the efficiency and increase the load of nodes.
In the same way, these mechanisms have to limit the number of exchanged
messages to avoid the overload of the network.
  In a previous paper, we have proposed two methods for the task management
called active and passive. These methods are based on a random walk: they are
fully distributed and fault tolerant. Each node owns a local tasks states set
updated thanks to a random walk and each node is in charge of the local
assignment. Here, we propose three methods to improve the efficiency of the
active method. These new methods are based on a circulating word. The nodes
local tasks states sets are updated thanks to periodical diffusions along trees
built from the circulating word. Particularly, we show that these methods
increase the efficiency of the active method: they produce less replicated
tasks. These three methods are also fully distributed and fault tolerant. On
the other way, the circulating word can be exploited for other applications

and implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a
quantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a
link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust
the strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff.
Further, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two
payoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results
have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and
efficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence.
Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

RPA approach using a projected spherical single particle basis. The oscillator
strengths calculated with a Schiff-like dipole transition operator and folded
with Lorentzian functions are used to calculate the photoabsorbtion cross
section spectra. The results are further employed to establish the dependence
of the plasmon frequency on the number of cluster components. Static electric
polarizabilities of the clusters excited in a RPA dipole state are also
calculated.
  Comparison of our results with the corresponding experimental data show an
overall good agreement.
