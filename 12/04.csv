vertices, known as the Curie-Weiss Model. It is well known that at high
temperature ($\beta < 1$) the mixing time is $\Theta(n\log n)$, whereas at low
temperature ($\beta > 1$) it is $\exp(\Theta(n))$. Recently, Levin, Luczak and
Peres considered a censored version of this dynamics, which is restricted to
non-negative magnetization. They proved that for fixed $\beta > 1$, the
mixing-time of this model is $\Theta(n\log n)$, analogous to the
high-temperature regime of the original dynamics. Furthermore, they showed
\emph{cutoff} for the original dynamics for fixed $\beta<1$. The question
whether the censored dynamics also exhibits cutoff remained unsettled.
  In a companion paper, we extended the results of Levin et al. into a complete
characterization of the mixing-time for the Currie-Weiss model. Namely, we
found a scaling window of order $1/\sqrt{n}$ around the critical temperature
$\beta_c=1$, beyond which there is cutoff at high temperature. However,
determining the behavior of the censored dynamics outside this critical window
seemed significantly more challenging.
  In this work we answer the above question in the affirmative, and establish
the cutoff point and its window for the censored dynamics beyond the critical
window, thus completing its analogy to the original dynamics at high
temperature. Namely, if $\beta = 1 + \delta$ for some $\delta > 0$ with
$\delta^2 n \to \infty$, then the mixing-time has order $(n /
\delta)\log(\delta^2 n)$. The cutoff constant is $(1/2+[2(\zeta^2 \beta /
\delta - 1)]^{-1})$, where $\zeta$ is the unique positive root of
$g(x)=\tanh(\beta x)-x$, and the cutoff window has order $n / \delta$.

is the sharp gap quenching at magic numbers. With the strength of the
interaction as a free parameter, the theory can reproduce the data to an rms
accuracy of about 0.25 MeV. This is slightly better than a single-parameter
phenomenological description but slightly poorer than the usual two-parameter
phenomenological form C/A^alpha . The following conclusions can be made about
the performance of common parametrization of the pairing interaction: (i) there
is a weak preference for a surface-peaked neutron-neutron pairing, which might
be attributable to many-body effects; (ii) a larger strength is required in the
proton pairing channel than in the neutron pairing channel; (iii) pairing
strengths adjusted to the well-known spherical isotope chains are too weak to
give a good overall fit to the mass differences.

dark matter halo, disc, bulge, and bar. The best-fitting solution has a dark
matter halo with a logarithmic inner density slope of gamma=0.9+/-0.3 for

with M/L_B =1.2+/-0.3 Upsilon_odot, in agreement with measurements of late-type

In this paper, a simple yet efficient algorithm is presented based on contrast
using wavelet packet decomposition. First, all the source images are decomposed
into low and high frequency sub-bands and then fusion of high frequency
sub-bands is done by the means of Directive Contrast. Now, inverse wavelet
packet transform is performed to reconstruct the fused image. The performance
of the algorithm is carried out by the comparison made between proposed and

is expected to become a powerful probe of dark energy. By measuring the
ellipticities of large numbers of background galaxies, the subtle gravitational
distortion called ""cosmic shear"" can be measured and used to constrain dark
energy parameters. The observed galaxy ellipticities, however, are induced not
by shear but by reduced shear, which also accounts for slight magnifications of
the images. This distinction is negligible for present weak lensing surveys,
but it will become more important as we improve our ability to measure and
understand small-angle cosmic shear modes. I calculate the discrepancy between
shear and reduced shear in the context of power spectra and cross spectra,
finding the difference could be as high as 10% on the smallest accessible
angular scales. I estimate how this difference will bias dark energy parameters
obtained from two weak lensing methods: weak lensing tomography and the shear
ratio method known as offset-linear scaling. For weak lensing tomography,
ignoring the effects of reduced shear will cause future surveys considered by
the Dark Energy Task Force to measure dark energy parameters that are biased by
amounts comparable to their error bars. I advocate that reduced shear be
properly accounted for in such surveys, and I provide a semi-analytic formula
for doing so. Since reduced shear cross spectra do not follow an offset-linear
scaling relation, the shear ratio method is similarly biased but with smaller
significance.

constructed a prototype GRAPE module containing a single CsI(Na) calorimeter

prototype has been combined with custom readout electronics and software to
create a complete ""engineering model"" of the GRAPE instrument. This engineering

  METHODS : Photometric data were acquired for 4 transits, and high precision
radial velocity measurements were simultaneously acquired with SARG@TNG for one
transit. The template spectra of HD 17156 was used to derive effective
temperature, gravity, and metallicity. A fit of the photometric and

the gravitino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), and with the
next-to-LSP decaying to the gravitino during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, are
analyzed. Particular emphasis is laid on their potential to solve the ""Li7
problem"", an apparent factor 2-4 overproduction of Li7 in standard Big Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN), their production of cosmologically important amounts of
Li6, as well as the resulting gravitino dark matter densities in these models.
The study includes several improvements compared to prior studies. Heavy
gravitinos in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMMSM) are
reanalyzed, whereas light gravitinos in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking
scenarios (GMSB) are studied for the first time. It is confirmed that decays of
NLSP staus to heavy gravitinos, while producing all the dark matter, may at the
same time resolve the Li7 problem. For NLSP decay times ~ 1000 sec, such
scenarios also lead to cosmologically important Li6 (and possibly Be9)
abundances. However, as such scenarios require heavy > 1 TeV staus they are
likely not testable at the LHC. It is found that decays of NLSP staus to light
gravitinos may lead to significant Li6 (and Be9) abundances, whereas NLSP
neutralinos decaying into light gravitinos may solve the Li7 problem. Though
both scenarios are testable at the LHC they may not lead to the production of
the bulk of the dark matter. A section of the paper outlines particle
properties required to significantly reduce the Li7 abundance, and/or enhance
the Li6 (and possibly Be9) abundances, by the decay of an arbitrary relic
particle.

anti-de Sitter spacetime are dual to stationary solutions of the equations of
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics on the conformal boundary of AdS. The dyonic
Kerr-Newman-AdS_4 solution corresponds to a charged diamagnetic fluid not
subject to any net Lorentz force, due to orthogonal magnetic and electric
fields compensating each other. The conserved charges, stress tensor and
R-current of the fluid are shown to be in exact agreement with the
corresponding quantities of the black hole. Furthermore, we obtain stationary
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in four dimensions, which yield
predictions for (yet to be constructed) charged rotating black strings in AdS_5
carrying nonvanishing momentum along the string. Finally, we consider
Scherk-Schwarz reduced AdS gravity on a circle. In this theory, large black
holes and black strings are dual to lumps of deconfined plasma of the
associated CFT. We analyze the effects that a magnetic field introduces in the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a plasma tube, which is holographically dual to
the Gregory-Laflamme instability of a magnetically charged black string.

Spheroidals are not dwarf ellipticals. They are structurally similar to

ellipticals come in two varieties: giant, non-rotating, boxy galaxies with
cuspy cores and smaller, rotating, disky galaxies that lack cores. We find a
new feature of this ""E-E dichotomy"": Coreless ellipticals have extra light at
the center with respect to an inward extrapolation of the outer Sersic profile.
We suggest that extra light is made in starbursts that swamp core scouring in
wet mergers. In general, only giant, core ellipticals contain X-ray gas halos.
We suggest that they formed in mergers that were kept dry by X-ray gas heated

clarify dynamics of magnetic field growth. We also investigate the effects of
the imposed magnetic fields on the MHD turbulence, including, as a limit, the
case of zero external field. Our findings are as follows. First, when we start
off simulations with weak mean magnetic field only (or with small scale random
field with zero imposed field), we observe that there is a stage at which
magnetic energy density grows linearly with time. Runs with different numerical
resolutions and/or different simulation parameters show consistent results for
the growth rate at the linear stage. Second, we find that, when the strength of
the external field increases, the equilibrium kinetic energy density drops by
roughly the product of the rms velocity and the strength of the external field.
The equilibrium magnetic energy density rises by roughly the same amount.
Third, when the external magnetic field is not very strong (say, less than ~0.2
times the rms velocity when measured in the units of Alfven speed), the
turbulence at large scales remains statistically isotropic, i.e. there is no
apparent global anisotropy of order B_0/v. We discuss implications of our
results on astrophysical fluids.

angular momentum transport from the gas to the stars inside of corotation leads
to a roughly time-steady spiral structure in the stellar disk. To make this

that do not include a cold gaseous component that is able to cool radiatively

dies out more rapidly in simulations that do not include gas. We also employ a
standard star formation prescription to convert gas into stars and find that
our results hold for typical gas consumption time scales that are in accord
with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We therefore attribute the long-lived
roughly time steady spiral structure in the stellar disk to the dynamical
coupling between the gas and the stars and the resultant torques that the
self-gravitating gaseous disk is able to exert on the stars due to an azimuthal
phase shift between the collisionless and dissipative components.

used to calculate the distribution of neutral interstellar H in the inner
heliosphere so that it takes the dependence of radiation pressure on radial
velocity into account, and (iii) compare the results of the old and new

~5 and ~3 AU and increase towards the Sun from a few percent to a factor of 1.5

~60-degr cone around the downwind direction, where a density deficit appears.
The magnitude of the discrepancies appreciably depends on the phase of the
solar cycle, but only weakly on the parameters of the gas at the termination
shock. For in situ measurements of neutral atoms performed at ~1 AU, the
Doppler correction will need to be taken into account, because the
modifications include both the magnitude and direction of the local flux by a
few km/s and degrees, respectively, which, when unaccounted for, would
introduce an error of a few km/s and degrees in determination of the magnitude

disparate time scales. Thus, molecular noise that often results in phenotypic
and population-dynamic consequences sets a fundamental limit to biochemical
signaling. While there have been numerous studies correlating the architecture
of cellular reaction networks with noise tolerance, only a limited effort has
been made to understand the dynamic role of protein-protein interactions. Here
we have developed a fully stochastic model for the positive feedback control of
a single gene, as well as a pair of genes (toggle switch), integrating
quantitative results from previous in vivo and in vitro studies. We find that
the overall noise-level is reduced and the frequency content of the noise is
dramatically shifted to the physiologically irrelevant high-frequency regime in
the presence of protein dimerization. This is independent of the choice of
monomer or dimer as transcription factor and persists throughout the multiple
model topologies considered. For the toggle switch, we additionally find that
the presence of a protein dimer, either homodimer or heterodimer, may
significantly reduce its random switching rate. Hence, the dimer promotes the
robust function of bistable switches by preventing the uninduced (induced)
state from randomly being induced (uninduced). The specific binding between
regulatory proteins provides a buffer that may prevent the propagation of
fluctuations in genetic activity. The capacity of the buffer is a non-monotonic
function of association-dissociation rates. Since the protein oligomerization
per se does not require extra protein components to be expressed, it provides a
basis for the rapid control of intrinsic or extrinsic noise.

breakup of these channel flows drives structured disk winds by transporting the
Poynting flux to the gas. These features are universally observed in the
simulations of various initial fields. This disk wind process should play an
essential role in the dynamical evaporation of proto-planetary disks. The
breakup of channel flows also excites the momentum fluxes associated with
Alfvenic and (magneto-)sonic waves toward the mid-plane, which possibly
contribute to the sedimentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary disks.

We generalize the concept of $q$-breathers -- periodic orbits in nonlinear

case of weak disorder, taking the Fermi-Pasta-Ulan chain as an example. We
show, that these nonlinear vibrational modes remain exponentially localized
near the central mode and stable, provided the disorder is sufficiently small.
The instability threshold depends sensitively on a particular realization of

an approach to controlling the energy flow between the modes is proposed. The

the Galactic metallicity gradient and its time evolution by comparing the
empirical gradients traced by a sample of 45 open clusters with a chemical
evolution model of the Galaxy. At variance with previous similar studies, we
have collected from the literature only abundances derived from
high--resolution spectra. The clusters have distances $7 < RGC<22$ kpc and ages
from $\sim 30$ Myr to 11 Gyr. We also consider the $\alpha$-elements Si, Ca,
Ti, and the iron-peak elements Cr and Ni. The data for iron-peak and
$\alpha$-elements indicate a steep metallicity gradient for R_GC<12$ kpc and a
plateau at larger radii. The time evolution of the metallicity distribution is
characterized by a uniform increase of the metallicity at all radii, preserving
the shape of the gradient, with marginal evidence for a flattening of the
gradient with time in the radial range 7-12 kpc. Our model is able to reproduce
the main features of the metallicity gradient and its evolution with an infall
law exponentially decreasing with radius and with a collapse time scale of the
order of 8 Gyr at the solar radius. This results in a rapid collapse in the
inner regions, i.e. $R_{\rm GC}\lesssim 12$ kpc (that we associate with an
early phase of disk formation from the collapse of the halo) and in a slow
inflow of material per unit area in the outer regions at a constant rate with

so far been observed in Delta Scuti stars. Nevertheless, the large number of
frequencies detected in recent photometric studies of selected Delta Scuti
stars allow us to look for regularities in the frequency spacing of modes. Mode
identifications are used to interpret these results.
  Statistical analyses of several Delta Scuti stars (FG Vir, 44 Tau, BL Cam and
others) show that the photometrically observed frequencies are not distributed
at random, but that the excited nonradial modes cluster around the frequencies
of the radial modes over many radial orders.
  The observed regularities can be partly explained by modes trapped in the
stellar envelope. This mode selection mechanism was proposed by Dziembowski &
Krolikowska (1990) and shown to be efficient for l = 1 modes. New pulsation
model calculations confirm the observed regularities.
  We present the s-f diagram, which compares the average separation of the
radial frequencies (s) with the frequency of the lowest-frequency unstable
radial mode (f). This provides an estimate for the log g value of the observed
star, if we assume that the centers of the observed frequency clusters
correspond to the radial mode frequencies. This assumption is confirmed by
examples of well-studied Delta Scuti variables in which radial modes were
definitely identified.

set P of n unknown points, whether it is possible to reconstruct P, up to a
finite set of possibilities (modulo rigid motions of the plane). The celebrated
Maxwell-Laman Theorem from Rigidity Theory says that, generically, the rigidity
problem has a combinatorial answer: the underlying combinatorial structure must
contain a spanning minimally-rigid graph (Laman graph). In the case where the
system is not rigid, its inclusion-wise maximal rigid substructures (rigid
components) are also combinatorially characterized via the Maxwell-Laman
theorem, and may be found efficiently.
  Physicists have used planar combinatorial rigidity has been used to study the
phase transition between liquid and solid in network glasses. The approach has
been to generate a graph via a stochastic process and then experimentally
analyze its rigidity properties. Of particular interest is the size of the
largest rigid components.
  In this paper, we study the emergence of rigid components in an Erdos-Renyi
random graph G(n,p), using the parameterization p=c/n for a fixed constant c>0.
Our first result is that for all c>0, almost surely all rigid components have
size 2, 3 or Omega(n). We also show that for c>4, almost surely the largest
rigid components have size at least n/10.
  While the G(n,p) model is simpler than those appearing in the physics
literature, these results are the first of this type where the distribution is
over all graphs on n vertices and the expected number of edges is O(n).

~4 kpc for the minor axis, centred at RA: 0h:51min, Dec: -73deg 7' (J2000.0).
The centre coordinates are found the same for all the different age population

they are found considerably different from the coordinates of the centre of the

disk, gives evidence that the stellar content is rotating, with a possible

a precise characterisation of a property observed by other authors, namely that
such maps fall into one of two classes termed co- and counter-twisting. We
single out three specific linked-twist maps, one each on the two-torus, in the
plane and on the two-sphere and for each prove a theorem concerning its ergodic
properties with respect to the invariant Lebesgue measure.
  For the map on the torus we prove that there is an invariant, zero-measure
Cantor set on which the dynamics are topologically conjugate to a full shift on
the space of symbol sequences. Such features are commonly known as topological
horseshoes. For the map in the plane we prove that there is a set of full
measure on which the dynamics are measure-theoretically isomorphic to a full
shift on the space of symbol sequences. This is commonly known as the Bernoulli
property and verifies, under certain conditions, a conjecture of Wojtkowski's.
We introduce the map on the sphere and prove that it too has the Bernoulli
property.

one might extend the results we have for specific linked-twist maps to the

a long-ranged anti-ferromagnetic interaction of strength g between the sites i
and j, decaying as |i-j|^-alpha, with alpha>1. For alpha smaller than a certain
threshold alpha_0, which is larger than 2 and depends on the ratio J/g, the
ground state consists of an ordered sequence of segments with equal length and
alternating magnetization. The width of the segments depends on both alpha and
the ratio J/g. Our Monte Carlo study shows that the on-site magnetization
vanishes at finite temperatures and finds no indication of any phase
transition. Yet, the modulation present in the ground state is recovered at
finite temperatures in the two-point correlation function, which oscillates in
space with a characteristic spatial period: The latter depends on alpha and J/g
and decreases smoothly from the ground-state value as the temperature is
increased. Such an oscillation of the correlation function is exponentially
damped over a characteristic spatial scale, the correlation length, which
asymptotically diverges roughly as the inverse of the temperature as T=0 is
approached. This suggests that the long-range interaction causes the Ising
chain to fall into a universality class consistent with an underlying
continuous symmetry. The e^(Delta/T)-temperature dependence of the correlation
length and the uniform ferromagnetic ground state, characteristic of the g=0
discrete Ising symmetry, are recovered for alpha > alpha_0.

  Using a reasonable intergalactic attenuation model, various extrapolations of
the EGRET spectra, as a proxy for GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope)

In the realm close to classical behavior, the quantum evolution is approximated
by a finite system of coupled but ordinary differential equations adhered to
the weakly imposed Hamiltonian constraint. For the simplified version of loop
quantum cosmology in the Bianchi I model with a free massless scalar filed, the
resulting effective equations of motion affirm the bouncing scenario predicted
by the previous studies: The big bang singularity is resolved and replaced by
the big bounces, which take place up to three times, once in each diagonal
direction, whenever the directional density approaches the critical value in
the regime of Planckian density. It is also revealed that back-reaction arises
from the quantum corrections and modifies the precise value of the directional
density at the bouncing epoch. Additionally, as an example of symmetry

the first time, our NICMOS data provides imaging with sufficient angular
resolution and depth to collate a sufficiently large sample of massive galaxies

$f_{m}=f_{0}(1+z)^{m}$ to a combined sample of low redshift data from Conselice

Press-Schechter curve to this data. This Press-Schechter fit, and the data,
show no sign of levelling off or turning over, implying that the merger
fraction of massive galaxies continues to rise with redshift out to z $\sim$ 3.
Since previous work has established that the merger fraction for lower mass
galaxies turns over at z $\sim$ 1.5 - 2.0, this is evidence that higher mass
galaxies experience more mergers earlier than their lower mass counterparts,
i.e. a galaxy assembly downsizing. Finally, we calculate a merger rate at z =

no significant change to $\Re$ $<$ 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$

halves of the 4f-series and imbibing the notion of ferromagnetic coupling
between the spins of all 4f-rare earth ions and that of the conduction
electrons. Magnetic moments of dissimilar RE ions in such admixed alloys,
however, get antiferromagnetically coupled and they display magnetic
compensation feature such that the field induced reversal in the orientation of
the magnetic moments of dissimilar rare earth ions happens across the
compensation temperature (Tcomp). Above a threshold field, the conduction
electron polarization also reverses its sign across Tcomp, this is argued to
correlate with the observed phase reversal in the exchange bias field.

example of fluctuation-induced long-ranged force acting on objects (conducting
plates) immersed in a fluctuating medium (quantum electromagnetic field in
vacuum). A similar effect emerges in statistical physics, where the force
acting, e.g., on colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture is
affected by the classical thermal fluctuations occurring in the surrounding
medium. The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon
approaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at
criticality. In turn, this universality allows one to investigate theoretically
the temperature dependence of the force via representative models and to
stringently test the corresponding predictions in experiments. In contrast to
QED, the Casimir force resulting from critical fluctuations can be easily tuned
with respect to strength and sign by surface treatments and temperature
control. We present some recent advances in the theoretical study of the
universal properties of the critical Casimir force arising in thin films. The
corresponding predictions compare very well with the experimental results
obtained for wetting layers of various fluids. We discuss how the Casimir force
between a colloidal particle and a planar wall immersed in a binary liquid

generalized quantum potential (in which the constant is no longer reduced to
the standard quantum constant hbar) is equivalent to a generalized Schrodinger
equation. Then we show that, even in the case of the presence of vorticity, it
is also possible to obtain, for a large class of systems, a Schrodinger-like
equation of the vectorial field type from the continuity and Euler equations
including a quantum potential. The same kind of transformation also applies to
a classical charged fluid subjected to an electromagnetic field and to an
additional potential having the form of a quantum potential. Such a fluid can
therefore be described by an equation of the Ginzburg-Landau type, and is
expected to show some superconducting-like properties. Moreover, a Schrodinger
form can be obtained for the fluctuating rotational motion of a solid. In this
case the mass is replaced by the tensor of inertia, and a generalized form of
the quantum potential is derived. We finally reconsider the case of a standard
diffusion process, and we show that, after a change of variable, the diffusion
equation can also be given the form of a continuity and Euler system including
an additional potential energy. Since this potential is exactly the opposite of
a quantum potential, the quantum behavior may be considered, in this context,

photoevaporation, thanks to its large population of massive members and of
stars with disk. In a previous work, we obtained evidence of the influence of
the strong UV field generated by the massive cluster members on the evolution
of disks around low-mass Pre-Main Sequence members. That work was based on a
multi-band BVIJHK and X-ray catalog purposely compiled to select the cluster
members with and without disk. Aims: in this paper we complete the list of
candidate cluster members, using data at longer wavelengths obtained with
Spitzer/IRAC, and we revisit the issue of the effects of UV radiation on the
evolution of disks in NGC 6611. Methods: we select the candidate members with
disks of NGC 6611, in a field of view of 33'x34' centered on the cluster, using
IRAC color-color diagrams and suitable reddening-free color indices. Besides,
using the X-ray data to select Class III cluster members, we estimate the disks
frequency vs. the intensity of the incident radiation emitted by massive
members. Results: we identify 458 candidate members with circumstellar disks,
among which 146 had not been revealed in our previous work. Comparing of the
various color indices we used to select the cluster members with disk, we claim
that they detect the excesses due to the emission of the same physical region
of the disk: the inner rim at the dust sublimation radius. Our new results
confirm that UV radiation from massive stars affects the evolution of nearby
circumstellar disks.

theory. These arise from the gauge coupling unification, from the smallness of
the neutrino masses, and via a non-vanishing muon anomaly. An overview of high
scale models is given with a view to possible tests at the Large Hadron
Collider. Specifically we discuss here some generic approaches to deciphering
their signatures. We also consider an out of the box possibility of a four
generation model where the fourth generation is a mirror generation rather than
a sequential generation. Such a scenario can lead to some remarkably distinct
signatures at the LHC.

describing the interaction between a scalar field and gauge vector bosons, the
dynamics of the Higgs mechanism is really affected by the representation gauge
chosen for the Higgs field. Actually, we find that, varying the parametrization
for the two degrees of freedom of the complex scalar field, we obtain different
expressions for the Higgs mass: in its turn this entails different expressions
for the critical temperatures, ranging from zero to a maximum value, as well as
different expressions for other basic thermodynamical quantities.

Stueckelberg mechanism for mass growth for the extra $U(1)_X$ gauge boson. The
assumption of an axionic connector field which carries dual U(1) quantum
numbers, i.e., quantum numbers for the hypercharge $U(1)_Y$ and for the hidden
sector gauge group $U(1)_X$, allows a non-trivial mixing between the mass
growth for the neutral gauge vector bosons in the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ sector
and the mass growth for the vector boson by the \st mechanism in the $U(1)_X$
sector. This results in an extra $Z'$ which can be very narrow, but still
detectable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The $U(1)_X$ extension of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model is also considered and the role of the
Fayet-Illiopoulos term in such an extension discussed. The $U(1)_X$ extensions
of the SM and of the MSSM lead to new candidates for dark matter.

Math. 122 (2009) 305",,,"nlin.SI nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, nonlocal symmetries for the bilinear KP and bilinear BKP
equations are re-studied. Two arbitrary parameters are introduced in these
nonlocal symmetries by considering gauge invariance of the bilinear KP and
bilinear BKP equations under the transformation $f\longrightarrow
fe^{ax+by+ct}$. By expanding these nonlocal symmetries in powers of each of two
parameters, we have derived two types of bilinear NKP hierarchies and two types
of bilinear NBKP hierarchies. An impressive observation is that bilinear
positive and negative KP and BKP hierarchies may be derived from the same
nonlocal symmetries for the KP and BKP equations. Besides, as two concrete
examples, we have deived bilinear B\""acklund transformations for $t_{-2}$-flow
of the NKP hierarchy and $t_{-1}$-flow of the NBKP hierarchy. All these results
have made it clear that more nice integrable properties would be found for
these obtained NKP hierarchies and NBKP hierarchies. Since KP and BKP
hierarchies have played an essential role in soliton theory, we believe that
the bilinear NKP and NBKP hierarchies will have their right place in this
field.

dark matter (DM) with large boost factor and decaying DM with the life around $
10^{26} s$ can account for the PAMELA and ATIC observations if their main final
products are charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). In this work, we
calculated the neutrino flux arising from $\mu$ and $\tau$ which originate from
annihilating/decaying DM, and estimated the final muon rate in the neutrino
telescopes, namely Antares and IceCube. Given the excellent angular resolution,
Antares and IceCube are promising to discover the neutrino signals from
Galactic center and/or large DM subhalo in annihilating DM scenario, but very
challenging in decaying DM scenario.
