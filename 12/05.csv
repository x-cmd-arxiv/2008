two inflaton fields, (2-brid inflation). We analyse the region in the parameter
and the initial condition space where a large non-Gaussianity may be generated
during slow-roll inflation which is generally characterised by a large f_NL,
tau_NL and a small g_NL. For certain parameter values we can satisfy
tau_NL>>f_NL^2. The bispectrum is of the local type but may have a significant
scale dependence. We show that the loop corrections to the power spectrum and
bispectrum are suppressed during inflation, if one assume that the fields
follow a classical background trajectory. We also include the effect of the
waterfall field, which can lead to a significant change in the observables
after the waterfall field is destabilised, depending on the couplings between
the waterfall and inflaton fields.

Here, we show that the ferromagnetic order of the Kondo lattice is amenable to

this ferromagnetic phase, the conduction electrons and local moments are
strongly coupled but the Fermi surface does not enclose the latter (i.e. it is

essential to increase robustness, accessibility, and reliability of data
transmission. However, this must be done with the least amount of protection
resources, while using simple management plane functionality. Recently, network
coding has been proposed as a solution to provide agile and cost efficient
network self-healing against link failures, in a manner that does not require
data rerouting, packet retransmission, or failure localization, hence leading
to simple control and management planes. To achieve this, separate paths have
to be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition
of extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose.
  In this paper we introduce autonomic self-healing strategies for autonomic
networks in order to protect against link failures. The strategies are based on
network coding and reduced capacity, which is a technique that we call network
protection codes (NPC). In these strategies, an autonomic network is able to
provide self-healing from various network failures affecting network operation.
The techniques improve service and enhance reliability of autonomic
communication.
  Network protection codes are extended to provide self-healing from multiple
link failures in autonomic networks. We provide implementation aspects of the
proposed strategies. We present bounds and network protection code
constructions. Finally, we study the construction of such codes over the binary
field. The paper also develops an Integer Linear Program formulation to
evaluate the cost of provisioning connections using the proposed strategies.

transferability of bulk derived SEPs to Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions. We find
that the SEP method is particularly well suited to address the tight binding
transferability problem because the transferability error at the interface can
be characterized not only in orbital space (via the interface local density of
states) but also in real space (via the system potential). To achieve a
quantitative parameterization, we introduce the notion of ghost semi-empirical
pseudopotentials extracted from the first-principles calculated Fe/MgO bonding
interface. Such interface corrections are shown to be particularly necessary
for barrier widths in the range of 1 nm, where interface states on opposite
sides of the barrier couple effectively and play a important role in the
transmission characteristics. In general the results underscore the need for
separate tight binding interface and bulk parameter sets when modeling

follow eight haloes similar in mass to the Milky Way and extracted from a large
cosmological simulation without restriction on spin parameter or merger
history. This allows us to investigate how the final properties of the
simulated galaxies correlate with the formation histories of their haloes. We
find that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contain a disc with more than 20 per
cent of its total stellar mass. Four of the eight galaxies nevertheless have
well-formed disc components, three have dominant spheroids and very small
discs, and one is a spheroidal galaxy with no disc at all. The z = 0 spheroids
are made of old stars, while discs are younger and formed from the inside-out.
Neither the existence of a disc at z = 0 nor the final disc-to-total mass ratio
seems to depend on the spin parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes
with spin parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.05; galaxies with little
or no disc component span the same range in spin parameter. Except for one of
the simulated galaxies, all have significant discs at z > ~2, regardless of
their z = 0 morphologies. Major mergers and instabilities which arise when
accreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar disc trigger a transfer of
mass from the discs to the spheroids. In some cases, discs are destroyed, while
in others, they survive or reform. This suggests that the survival probability
of discs depends on the particular formation history of each galaxy. A
realistic Lambda-CDM model will clearly require weaker star formation at high
redshift and later disc assembly than occurs in our models.

shoulders. By measuring the spectra as a function of temperature with both gold
and superconducting niobium tips, we establish that the gap-like features are

challenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the
question: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would
help shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new
observational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporal
and spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can
be well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock
wave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within
the range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the
afterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another
progenitor than other LGRBs. Recently, Swift-discovered GRB080503 also has the
spike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similar
to GRB060614. We analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that this
GRB is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of
0.8$\pm$0.4 s during its tail emission. Thus, the properties of the prompt
emission of GRB060614 and GRB080503 are clearly different, motivating further
thinking of GRB classification. Finally we note that, whereas the progenitor of
the two SN-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for the
SN-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can be
observationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the X-ray
decay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.

smaller for the accelerated Wilson loop than for the static one in a thermal

velocity-dependence of the screening length of the colour force, previously
obtained from a moving Wilson loop in a finite temperature background, is not
specific for the string, but is a consequence of the generic fact that an

a velocity-dependent temperature. Finally, we analyse accelerated particles and

transformations in Pu is to determine the energetically favored, continuous
atomic pathways from one crystal symmetry to another. This problem involves
enumerating candidate pathways and studying their energetics to garner insight
into instabilities and energy barriers. The purpose of this work is to
investigate the energetics of two transformation pathways for the delta to
alpha' transformation in Pu that were recently proposed [Lookman et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 100:145504, 2008] on the basis of symmetry. These pathways require
the presence of either an intermediate hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) structure
or a simple hexagonal (sh) structure. A subgroup of the parent fcc and the
intermediate hexagonal structure, which has trigonal symmetry, facilitates the
transformation to the intermediate hcp or sh structure. Phonons then break the
translational symmetry from the intermediate hcp or sh structure to the final
monoclinic symmetry of the alpha' structure. We perform simulations using the
modified embedded atom method (MEAM) for Pu to investigate these candidate
pathways. Our main conclusion is that the path via hcp is energetically favored
and the volume change for both pathways essentially occurs in the second step
of the transformation, i.e. from the intermediate sh or hcp to the monoclinic
structure. Our work also highlights the deficiency of the current
state-of-the-art MEAM potential in capturing the anisotropy associated with the
lower symmetry monoclinic structure.

excellent agreement with previous determinations from the gas kinematics, and
in particular with our own published values, extracted from the same data. This
provides one of the cleanest gas versus stars comparisons of BH determination,
due to the use of integral-field data for both dynamical tracers and due to a
very well resolved BH sphere of influence R_BH~0.70"". We derive an accurate
profile of the orbital anisotropy and we carefully test its reliability using
spherical Jeans models with radially varying anisotropy. We find an increase in
the tangential anisotropy close to the BH, but the spatial extent of this

integrate instantaneous electric or magnetic field values from successive

differences between frequencies are ordinarily irrelevant, and recalibration
procedures at most correct for frequency differences. With drifting selection,
however, each integrated field value comes from *the sinusoid of the
instantaneously selected frequency at its instantaneous received phase*, hence
the waveform constructed by the integration will follow the drifting selection
with a phase acceleration given by the drift rate times the slope of the
received phase spectrum. A phase acceleration is literally a frequency shift,
and the phase spectrum slope of a received waveform is an asymptotic measure of
the source distance, as the path delay presents phase offsets proportional to
frequency times the distance, and eventually exceeding all initial phase
differences. Tunable optics may soon be fast enough for realizing such shifts
by Fourier switching, and could lead to pocket X-ray devices; sources

these parameters can be probed or observed. In a resource constrained
situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system
performance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem.
This general problem is the focus of this paper.
  One of the most important considerations in this framework is whether
adaptivity is required for the observations. Adaptive observations introduce
blocking or sequential operations in the system whereas non-adaptive
observations can be performed in parallel. One of the important questions in
this regard is to characterize the benefit of adaptivity for probes and
observation.
  We present general techniques for designing constant factor approximations to
the optimal observation schemes for several widely used scheduling and metric
objective functions. We show a unifying technique that relates this
optimization problem to the outlier version of the corresponding deterministic
optimization. By making this connection, our technique shows constant factor
upper bounds for the benefit of adaptivity of the observation schemes. We show
that while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function,
being adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors.

constructed a dynamical system well suited to investigate the dynamics where

intuitive manner by the exercise of constructing a wave in association with a
classical particle. Using special relativity, the time coordinate in the frame
of reference of a moving particle is expressed in terms of the coordinates in
the laboratory frame of reference in order to provide an initial spatiotemporal
function to work from in initiating the development of a quantum wave. When
temporal periodicity is ascribed to the particle, a provisional spatiotemporal
function for a particle travelling at constant velocity manifests itself as an
running wave characterized by parameters associated with the moving particle. A
wave description for bidirectional motion is generated based on an average time
coordinate for a combination of oppositely directed elementary running waves,
and the resulting spatiotemporal function exhibits wave behavior characteristic
of a standing wave. Ascribing directional orientation to the intrinsic
periodicity of the particle introduces directional sub-states; variations in
the relative number of sub-states as a function of angle in combined states
lead to spatially varying magnitudes for the associated waves. Further analysis
leads to full mathematical expression for all waves representing free particle
motion. A generalization for particles subject to force fields enables us to
develop a governing differential equation identical in form to the Schroedinger
equation.

orbits of short-period massive planets--hot Jupiters. We revisit a mechanism
proposed by Ogilvie and Lin for tidal forcing of inertial waves, which are
short-wavelength, low-frequency disturbances restored primarily by Coriolis
rather than buoyancy forces. This mechanism is of particular interest for hot
Jupiters because it relies upon a rocky core, and because these bodies are
otherwise largely convective. Compared to waves excited at the base of the
stratified, externally heated atmosphere, waves excited at the core are more
likely to deposit heat in the convective region and thereby affect the
planetary radius. However, Ogilvie and Lin's results were numerical, and the
manner of the wave excitation was not clear. Using WKB methods, we demonstrate
the production of short waves by scattering of the equilibrium tide off the
core at critical latitudes. The tidal dissipation rate associated with these
waves scales as the fifth power of the core radius, and the implied tidal $Q$
is of order ten million for nominal values of the planet's mass, radius,
orbital period, and core size. We comment upon an alternative proposal by Wu
for exciting inertial waves in an unstratified fluid body by means of
compressibility rather than a core. We also find that even a core of rock is
unlikely to be rigid. But Ogilvie and Lin's mechanism should still operate if
the core is substantially denser than its immediate surroundings.

exploration in the mass spectrum, around 10^{13}- 10^{14} M_{sun}, which is a
crucial range for understanding the transition between galaxies and galaxy
clusters. Our analysis is based on multi-colour CFHTLS images complemented with
HST imaging and ground based spectroscopy. Large scale properties are derived
from both the light distribution of the elliptical galaxies group members and
weak lensing of the faint background galaxy population. On small scales, the
strong lensing analysis yields Einstein radii between 2.5"" and 8"". On larger
scales, the strong lenses coincide with the peak of the light distribution,
suggesting that mass is traced by light. Most of the luminosity maps have
complicated shapes, indicating that these intermediate mass structures are
dynamically young. Fitting the reduced shear with a Singular Isothermal Sphere,
we find sigma ~ 500 km/s and an upper limit of ~900 km/s for the whole sample.
The mass to light ratio for the sample is found to be M/L_i ~ 250 (solar units,
corrected for evolution), with an upper limit of 500. This can be compared to
mass to light ratios of small groups (with sigma ~ 300 km/s and galaxy clusters
with sigma > 1000 km/s, thus bridging the gap between these mass scales.

relativistic blast-wave interacting with the ambient medium, as a model for GRB
afterglows, and compare them with observations. An afterglow flux evolving as a
power-law in time, a bright optical flash during/after the burst, and a
light-curve break due to a tight ejecta collimation are the major predictions
that were confirmed observationally, but it should be recognized that
light-curve decay indices are not correlated with the spectral slopes (as would
be expected), optical flashes are quite rare, and jet-breaks harder to find in
Swift X-ray afterglows.
  The slowing of the early optical flux decay rate is accompanied by a spectral
evolution, indicating that the emission from ejecta (energized by the reverse
shock) is dominant in the optical over that from the forward shock (which
energizes the ambient medium) only up to 1 ks. However, a long-lived reverse
shock is required to account for the slow radio flux decays observed in many
afterglows after ~10 day.
  X-ray light-curve plateaus could be due to variations in the average
energy-per-solid-angle of the blast-wave, confirming to two other anticipated
features of GRB outflows: energy injection and angular structure. The latter is
also the more likely origin of the fast-rises seen in some optical
light-curves. To account for the existence of both chromatic and achromatic
afterglow light-curve breaks, the overall picture must be even more complex and
include a new mechanism that dominates occasionally the emission from the
blast-wave: either late internal shocks or scattering (bulk and/or
inverse-Compton) of the blast-wave emission by an outflow interior to it.

event, \sqrt{s}_{min} is simply given by the formula
\sqrt{s}_{min}=\sqrt{E^2-P_z^2}+\sqrt{\met^2+M_{inv}^2}, where M_{inv} is the
total mass of all invisible particles produced in the event. We use t\bar{t}
production and several supersymmetry examples to argue that the peak in the

particles originally produced in the event. This conjecture allows a
determination of the heavy superpartner mass scale (as a function of the LSP
mass) in a completely general and model-independent way, and without the need
for any exclusive event reconstruction. In our SUSY examples of several
multijet plus missing energy signals, the accuracy of the mass measurement
based on \sqrt{s}_{min} is typically at the percent level, and never worse than
10%. After including the effects of initial state radiation and multiple parton
interactions, the precision gets worse, but for heavy SUSY mass spectra remains
10%.

demonstrate that the odd-frequency state can be properly described within the

dissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the $m=1$ mode. On the
contrary, our quadrupolar model does not produce a steady relativistic
($\Gamma\gtrsim 3$) jet due to mass-loading of the polar regions caused by
unstable polar fields. Thus, if produced, relativistic jets are roughly stable
structures and may reach up to an external shock with strong magnetic fields.
We discuss the astrophysical implications of the accreted magnetic geometry
playing such a significant role in relativistic jet formation, and we outline
avenues for future work.

classical {\it one-way multi-head finite automata} (J. Hromkovi\v{c}, Acta
Informatica 19 (1983) 377-384), and it has been shown that this new one-way
QFAs (multi-letter QFAs) can accept with no error some regular languages
$(a+b)^{*}b$ that are unacceptable by the previous one-way QFAs. In this paper,
we study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main
technical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a
$k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_2$, over the
same input alphabet $\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are
$(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of
$\Sigma$, $k=\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$
being the numbers of states of ${\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\cal A}_{2}$, respectively.
When $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in
the literature. It is worth mentioning that our technical method is essentially
different from that for the decidability of the case of single input alphabet
(i.e., $m=1$). (2) However, if we determine the equivalence of multi-letter
QFAs by checking all strings of length not more than $ n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k$,
then the worst time complexity is exponential, i.e.,
$O(n^6m^{n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+2k-1})$. Therefore, we design a polynomial-time
$O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any
two multi-letter QFAs. Here, the time complexity is concerning the number of
states in the multi-letter QFAs, and $k$ is thought of as a constant.

modeling multi-input non-linear systems. The product of Volterra analysis, the
Volterra kernels, are particularly suited to quantifying intra- and inter-input
interactions. They are also readily interpretable, which means that they can be
related directly to physical behaviors, and more distantly, to the underlying
processing mechanisms of the system being tested. However, accurate estimation
of a sufficient set of classical kernels is often not possible for complex
systems because the number of kernels that need to be determined, and hence
experiment time, increases radically with system memory, response frequency
bandwidth, and non-linear interaction order. Practical approaches to kernel
estimation often involve forced reductions of the generality of the analysis
that in turn compromise interpretability.
  Here we illustrate the effects on kernel interpretability of two common
reductions, slow-stimulation and the use of binary inputs, using both numerical
simulations and data from a Visual Evoked Potential experiment. We show how a
non-standard version of binary analysis, involving a different coding of the
inputs and the use of particular groupings of kernel slices, improves kernel
interpretability. We bring together, in a comprehensive fashion, all of the
mathematical considerations needed to apply and interpret the results of
Volterra kernel analyses. The input-coding method we describe allows one to
correctly quantify multi-input interactive effects that occur both within the
separate input channels and across them.

Results from seasonal re-forecast studies suggest that climate model ensembles
based on stochastic-dynamic parametrisation are beginning to outperform
multi-model ensembles, and have the potential to become significantly more
skilful than multi-model ensembles.
  The case is made for stochastic representations of model uncertainty in
future-generation climate prediction models. Firstly, a guiding characteristic
of the scientific method is an ability to characterise and predict uncertainty;
individual climate models are not currently able to do this. Secondly, through
the effects of noise-induced rectification, stochastic-dynamic parametrisation
may provide a (poor man's) surrogate to high resolution. Thirdly,
stochastic-dynamic parametrisations may be able to take advantage of the
inherent stochasticity of electron flow through certain types of low-energy

retina to cortex. The amount of information that spike trains encode is usually
estimated from the precision of spike timing with respect to the stimulus.
Sensory input, however, is only one factor that influences neural activity. For
example, intrinsic dynamics, such as oscillations of networks of neurons, also
modulate firing pattern. Here, we asked if retinal oscillations might help to
convey information to neurons downstream. Specifically, we made whole-cell
recordings from relay cells to reveal retinal inputs (EPSPs) and thalamic
outputs (spikes) and analyzed these events with information theory. Our results
show that thalamic spike trains operate as two multiplexed channels. One
channel, which occupies a low frequency band (<30 Hz), is encoded by average
firing rate with respect to the stimulus and carries information about local
changes in the image over time. The other operates in the gamma frequency band
(40-80 Hz) and is encoded by spike time relative to the retinal oscillations.
Because these oscillations involve extensive areas of the retina, it is likely
that the second channel transmits information about global features of the
visual scene. At times, the second channel conveyed even more information than
the first.

is paid to models with a significant contribution of dark energy at early times

have been developed for describing the dynamics of the one-body density of both
colloidal and atomic fluids. In the colloidal case, the particles are assumed
to have stochastic equations of motion and theories exist for both the case
when the particle motion is over-damped and also in the regime where inertial
effects are relevant. In this paper we extend the theory and explore the
connections between the microscopic DDFT and the equations of motion from
continuum fluid mechanics. In particular, starting from the Kramers equation
which governs the dynamics of the phase space probability distribution function
for the system, we show that one may obtain an approximate DDFT that is a
generalisation of the Euler equation. This DDFT is capable of describing the
dynamics of the fluid density profile down to the scale of the individual
particles. As with previous DDFTs, the dynamical equations require as input the
Helmholtz free energy functional from equilibrium density functional theory
(DFT). For an equilibrium system, the theory predicts the same fluid one-body
density profile as one would obtain from DFT. Making further approximations, we
show that the theory may be used to obtain the mode coupling theory that is
widely used for describing the transition from a liquid to a glassy state.

than sixty years that the electronic structure of graphene can be modelled by
two-dimensional massless relativistic fermions. This property gives rise to
numerous applications, both in applied sciences and in theoretical physics.
Electronic circuits made out of graphene could take advantage of its high
electron mobility that is witnessed even at room temperature. In the
theoretical domain the Dirac-like behavior of graphene can simulate high energy
effects, such as the relativistic Klein paradox. Even more surprisingly,
topological effects can be encoded in graphene such as the generation of
vortices, charge fractionalization and the emergence of anyons. The impact of
the topological effects on graphene's electronic properties can be elegantly
described by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Here we present a pedagogical
encounter of this theorem and review its various applications to graphene. A
direct consequence of the index theorem is charge fractionalization that is
usually known from the fractional quantum Hall effect. The charge
fractionalization gives rise to the exciting possibility of realizing graphene
based anyons that unlike bosons or fermions exhibit fractional statistics.
Besides being of theoretical interest, anyons are a strong candidate for
performing error free quantum information processing.

cooperators or only the defectors, and show that both options promote
cooperation irrespective of the applied game. Opposite to intuitive reasoning,

defection is, in the long run, more beneficial for cooperation than the
likewise promotion of cooperators. We explain the contradictory impact of the
two considered coevolutionary rules by examining the differences between
resulting heterogeneities that segregate participating players, and
furthermore, demonstrate that the influential individuals completely determine

media with negative dielectric permittivity ($\varepsilon$) and magnetic
permeability ($\mu$) parameters. First we investigate the transport of optical
pulses through an electrical plasma and a negative refractive index medium
(NRM) of infinite and semi-infinite extents where no resonant effects come into
play. The total delay time of the pulse constitutes of the group delay time and
the reshaping delay time as analyzed by Peatross et al \cite{peatross}. For
evanescent waves, even with broadband width, the total delay time is negative
for an infinite medium whereas it is positive for the semi-infinite case.
Evidence of the Hartman effect is seen for small propagation distance compared
to the free space pulse length. The reshaping delay mostly dominates the total
delay time in NRM whereas it vanishes when $\varepsilon(\omega)=\mu(\omega)$.
  Next we present results on the propagation times through a dispersive slab.
While both large bandwidth and large dissipation have similar effects in
smoothening out the resonant features that appear due to Fabry-P\'{e}rot
resonances, large dissipation can result in very small or even negative
traversal times near the resonant frequencies. We investigate the traversal and
the Wigner delay times for obliquely incident pulses. The coupling of
evanescent waves to slab plasmon polariton modes results in large traversal
times at the resonant conditions. We also find that the group velocity mainly
contributes to the delay time for pulse propagating across a slab with
refractive index (n) = -1. The traversal times are positive and subluminal for
pulses with sufficiently large bandwidths.

The main purpose of this paper is to study time delays between the
light variations in different wavebands for a sample of quasars. Measuring a
reliable time delay for a large number of quasars may help constraint the
models of their central engines. The standard accretion disk irradiation model
predicts a delay of the longer wavelengths behind the shorter ones, a delay
that depends on the fundamental quasar parameters. Since the black hole masses
and the accretion rates are approximately known for the sample we use, one can
compare the observed time delays with the expected ones.
  Methods. We applied the interpolation cross-correlation function (ICCF)
method to the Giveon et al. sample of 42 quasars, monitored in two (B and R)
colors, to find the time lags represented by the ICCF peaks. Different tests
were performed to assess the influence of photometric errors, sampling, etc.,
on the final result.
  Results. We found that most of the objects show a delay in the red light
curve behind the blue one (a positive lag), which on average for the sample is
about +4 days (+3 for the median), although the scatter is significant. These
results are broadly consistent with the reprocessing model, especially for the
well-sampled objects. The normalized time-lag deviations do not seem to
correlate significantly with other quasar properties, including optical, radio,
or X-ray measurables. On the other hand, many objects show a clear negative
lag, which, if real, may have important consequences for the variability
models.

formulated in the $U_d\to\infty$ limit for the metallic phase in the physically

Ce, Eu, and Yb ions are discussed using the periodic Anderson model with an
infinite correlation between $f$ electrons. The slave boson solution of the
periodic model shows that the Fermi liquid scale T$_0$ and the Kondo scale
T$_K$ depend on the shape of the conduction electrons density of states ($c$
DOS) in the vicinity of the chemical potential, that the details of the band
structure determine the ratio T$_0$/T$_K$, and that the crossover between the
high- and low-temperature regimes in ordered compounds is system-dependent.
  A sharp peak in the $c$ DOS yields T$_0 \ll$T$_K$ and explains the 'slow
crossover' observed in YbAl$_3$ or YbMgCu$_4$. A minimum in the $c$ DOS yields
T$_0 \gg$T$_K$, which leads to the abrupt transition between the high- and
low-temperature regimes in YbInCu$_4$. In the case of CeCu$_2$Ge$_2$ and
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, where T$_0 \simeq T_K$, the slave boson solution explains the
pressure experiments which reveal sharp peaks in the T$^2$ coefficient of the
electrical resistance, $A=\rho(T)/T^2$, and the residual resistance. These
peaks are due to the change in the degeneracy of the $f$ states induced by the
applied pressure.
  We show that the low-temperature response of the periodic Anderson model can
be enhanced (or reduced) with respect to the predictions based on the
single-impurity models that give the same high-temperature behavior.

significant implications for the microscale. Motivated by nonlinear dynamical
systems theory and black-hole thermodynamics, the Invariant Set Postulate
proposes that cosmological states of physical reality belong to a
non-computable fractal state-space geometry I, invariant under the action of
some subordinate deterministic causal dynamics. An exploratory analysis is made
of a possible causal realistic framework for quantum physics, based on key
properties of I. For example, sparseness is used to relate generic
counterfactual states to points not lying on I, thus providing a geometric
basis for the essential contextuality of quantum physics and the role of the
abstract Hilbert Space in quantum theory. Also, self-similarity, described in a
symbolic setting, provides a possible ""realistic"" perspective on the essential
role of complex numbers and quaternions in quantum theory. A new interpretation
is given to the standard ""mysteries"" of quantum theory: superposition,
measurement, nonlocality, emergence of classicality and so on. It is proposed
that heterogeneities in the fractal geometry of I are manifestations of the
phenomenon of gravity. Since quantum theory is inherently blind to the
existence of such state-space geometries, the analysis here suggests that
attempts to formulate unified theories of physics within a conventional
quantum-theoretic framework are misguided, and that a successful quantum theory
of gravity should unify the causal non-Euclidean geometry of space time with
the atemporal fractal geometry of state space.

from the inner accretion disc. From a fit with a diskline profile we find an
inner radius of the disc of 8.7^(+3.7)_(-2.7) R_g, corresponding to

infinite series of non-BPS representations.
  We apply our method to study elliptic genera of hyper-Kahler manifolds in

the smooth superluminal jet we were able to identify and track three components
over time moving outwards with relatively high apparent superluminal speeds

jet in this source. Component ejections occur at a relatively high rate (once
in two months), and they are accompanied by mm-continuum outbursts.
Superluminal jet components move along wiggling trajectories, which is an

from the mean motion vector of a known or suspected moving group, one can
identify additional members of the group based on proper motion data and
photometry in the optical and infrared, with minimal contamination from
background field stars. We demonstrate this technique by conducting a search
for low-mass members of the Beta Pictoris Moving Group in the Tycho-2 catalog.
All known members of the moving group are easily recovered, and a list of 51
possible candidates is generated. Moving group membership is evaluated for 33
candidates based on X-ray flux from ROSAT, Halpha line emission, and radial
velocity measurement from high-resolution infrared spectra obtained at Infrared
Telescope Facility. We confirm three of the candidates to be new members of the
group: TYC 1186-706-1, TYC 7443-1102-1, and TYC 2211-1309-1 which are late-K

whose periods are consistent with their photometric ephemerides; two of these
spectroscopic orbits are singled-lined and six are double-lined. For one of the
candidates, a nearby but fainter eclipsing binary proved to be the source for
the HATNet light curve, due to blending in the HATNet images. Four of the
candidates were found to be rotating more rapidly than vsini = 50 km/s and were
not pursued further. Thirteen of the candidates showed no significant velocity
variation at the level of 0.5 to 1.0 km/s . Seven of these were eventually
withdrawn as photometric false alarms based on an independent reanalysis using
more sophisticated tools. Of the remaining six, one was put aside because a
close visual companion proved to be a spectroscopic binary, and two were not
followed up because the host stars were judged to be too large. Two of the
remaining candidates are members of a visual binary, one of which was
previously confirmed as the first HATNet transiting planet, HAT-P-1b. In this
paper we confirm that the last of this set of candidates is also a a transiting
planet, which we designate HAT-P-8b, with mass Mp = 1.52 +/- 0.18/0.16 Mjup,

recognized as very interesting for its computational efficiency and its ability
to reproduce many behaviors observed in cortical neurons. For this reason it is
currently widely used, in particular for large scale simulations of neural
networks. This model emulates the dynamics of the membrane potential of a
neuron together with an adaptation variable. The subthreshold dynamics is
governed by a two-parameter differential equation, and a spike is emitted when
the membrane potential variable reaches a given cutoff value. Subsequently the
membrane potential is reset, and the adaptation variable is added a fixed value
called the spike-triggered adaptation parameter. We show in this note that when
the system does not converge to an equilibrium point, both variables of the
subthreshold dynamical system blow up in finite time whatever the parameters of
the dynamics. The cutoff is therefore essential for the model to be well
defined and simulated. The divergence of the adaptation variable makes the
system very sensitive to the cutoff: changing this parameter dramatically
changes the spike patterns produced. Furthermore from a computational
viewpoint, the fact that the adaptation variable blows up and the very sharp
slope it has when the spike is emitted implies that the time step of the
numerical simulation needs to be very small (or adaptive) in order to catch an
accurate value of the adaptation at the time of the spike. It is not the case
for the similar quartic (Touboul 2008) and exponential (Brette and Gerstner
2005) models whose adaptation variable does not blow up in finite time, and
which are therefore very robust to changes in the cutoff value.

function is equal to 1 when m and n are relatively prime. These conjectures
were later proven by Jonsson [Jonsson, Electronic J. Combin., 13(1) (2006),

interesting properties when the circumference of the cylinder is odd. In
